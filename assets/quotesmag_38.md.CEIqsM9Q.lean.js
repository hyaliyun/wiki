The family has been highly prominent for centuries, first in the Kingdom of Poland, later in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and presently in the Republic of Poland. Since the 16th century, members of the Kurnatowski family have been active in politics, the arts, and military affairs. The family has maintained extensive wealth and land holdings, including palaces in Biezdrowo, Dusina, Go≈õcieszyn, Kotowo, and ≈ªo≈Çƒôdowo.

W. Pabst and starring American silent star Louise Brooks. It is shot in black and white, and various versions of the film range from 79 minutes to 116 minutes in length. This was Brooks' second and last film with Pabst, and like their prior collaboration, Pandora's Box, it is considered to be a classic by many film historians. It is based on the controversial and bestselling 1905 novel of the same name by Margarete B√∂hme. A previous screen adaptation of the novel, directed in 1918 by Richard Oswald, is currently classified as a lost film. ==Plot== Thymian Henning (Louise Brooks), the innocent, naive daughter of pharmacist Robert Henning (Josef Rovensk√Ω), is puzzled when their housekeeper, Elisabeth (Sybille Schmitz), leaves suddenly on the day of Thymian's confirmation. It turns out that her father has got Elisabeth pregnant. Elisabeth's body is brought to the pharmacy later that day, an apparent suicide by drowning, upsetting Thymian. Thymian's father's assistant Meinert (Fritz Rasp), promises to explain it all to her late that night, but instead takes advantage of her and she also becomes pregnant. Though Thymian refuses to name the illegitimate baby's father, the relatives find out from her diary, and decide that the best solution is for her to marry Meinert. When she refuses because she does not love him, they give the baby to a midwife and send her to a strict reformatory for wayward girls run by a tyrannical woman (Valeska Gert) and her tall, bald assistant (Andrews Engelmann). Meanwhile, Thymian's friend, Count Osdorff (Andr√© Roanne), is cast off and left penniless by his rich uncle, also Count Osdorff (Arnold Korff), after he proves unsuccessful at every school and trade. Thymian begs her friend to persuade her father to take her back, but Thymian's father has married his new housekeeper, Meta (Franziska Kinz), and Meta wants no rivals for Robert's affection. Rebelling against the reformatory's rigid discipline, Thymian and her friend Erika (Edith Meinhard) escape with Osdorff's help. When Thymian goes to see her baby, she is told the child has just died. After despondently wandering the streets, she re-unites with Erika, who is working in a small, upper-class brothel. With no skills, Thymian also becomes a prostitute. By chance, Thymian encounters her father, Meta, and Meinert in a nightclub. Her father is shocked when he realizes what she has become, and Meta and Meinhert prevent them from speaking by quickly ushering Robert out of the nightclub. Three years later, her father dies. With the expectation of inheriting a large amount of money, Thymian decides to start a new life. Her friends at the brothel suggest she obtain a new identity by marrying Osdorff. After thinking about it, he agrees. At the lawyer's office, Meinert buys Thymian's interest in the pharmacy, making her rich. However, when she learns that Meinert is throwing Meta and her two children out on the street, Thymian gives Meta the money so that her young half-sister will not suffer her fate. Osdorff, who had been counting on the money to rebuild a life for himself too, throws himself out the window to his death when she tells him what she has done. The uncle, grief-stricken, decides to make amends by taking care of Thymian. He introduces her to his cousin as his niece, Countess Osdorff. In a strange twist of fate, Thymian is invited to become a director of the same reformatory where she herself was once held. When Erika, her old friend, is brought before the directors as an \\"especially difficult case\\", Thymian denounces the school and its \\"blessings\\" and takes Erika out of the room. Count Osdorff follows the two women; but before leaving he pauses, turns back toward his startled cousin, and declares, \\"A little more love and no-one would be lost in this world!\\" ==CastRelease== Diary of a Lost Girl premiered in Vienna, Austria on 12 September 1929.

It has also been translated as Little Lucy Goosey Girl, and classified as Aarne-Thompson tale type 870A. ==Synopsis== Little Aase (she is \\"Annie\\" or \\"Lucy\\" in English versions) worked for the king as a goose-girl. One day, she sat on the road to see the king's son. He warned her not to look to have him, and she declared that if she was to have him, she would. The Prince looked over all the pictures of princesses sent him, and chose one. He had a stone that knew everything and would answer questions, so Aase warned the princess that if there were anything about her that she didn't want the prince to know, she had best not step on the stone that lay beside the bed. The princess asked that Aase get into the bed, and then, when the prince was asleep, Aase would get out and the princess would get in. When Aase got in, the prince asked who stepped into his bed, and was told a maid, but when the princess and Aase had traded places, the princess got out in the morning, the prince asked who stepped out, and the stone said someone who has borne three babies. He sent her away, and sent for another princess. From his warning to Aase not to think to have him, to the princess's stepping out of bed, it went as with the first, except that this princess had borne six. He sent her away, and sent for a third. But this time, when Aase was still in bed with him, he put a ring on her finger, too tight for her to get off again. When the third princess proved to have borne nine babies, he asked the stone the trick, and it told him how the princesses had all put Aase in their place. The prince went to find Aase. She had a rag tied about her finger, and although she claimed to have cut herself, he pulled it off and found the ring. So they wed, and Aase had the king's son after all. ==Literary analogues== The tale is grouped under Aarne- Thompson tale type 870A \\"The Little Goose-Girl\\". It is similar to Maid Maleen (type 870), in which the heroine also substitutes for a false bride who stands in no relationship to her, and takes her place.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 119-20, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 A Gil Brenton, Child ballad 5, and its Scandavian variants, uses the same elements as this fairy tale to rather different effect. The hero, on learning that the pregnant bride has substituted a servant who is a maiden, then learns through her story or various tokens he gave her that he is the father of her child.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 66, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The substitution of a maiden for the non-virgin bride is found earlier in many forms of the legend of Tristan and Iseult; Iseult, having lost her virginity to Tristan on the journey, substitutes her maid Brangwin.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 67, Dover Publications, New York 1965 ==Commentary== When George Webbe Dasent made his translation of these tales, in his preface he forbade children to read the last two stories, of which this was one. J. R. R. Tolkien cited this in his essay \\"On Fairy-Stories\\"; although he approved of Dasant's refusal to let prudery dictate his translation, Tolkien thought the command sprang from the belief that fairy tales were naturally children's literature.J.

Ceresiosaurus, meaning \\"Lizard of Ceresio\\" (Ceresio is the name of the Lake Lugano, in Switzerland). The type species, Ceresiosaurus calcagnii, was named by Bernhard Peyer in 1931. C. calcagnii is known from both the Cava superiore and Cava inferiore beds of the Lower Meride Limestone at Monte San Giorgio, dating to the latest Anisian of the Middle Triassic. Rieppel (1998) suggested that the back then monospecific genus Ceresiosaurus, is a junior synonym of the better known Lariosaurus, yet he kept it type species as a separate species under the new combination L. calcagnii. In 2004, however, this synonymy was objected by H√§nni who described and name a second species of Ceresiosaurus, C. lanzi - a separation supported by several other authors since. This species is known only from the stratigraphically younger Cassima beds of Monte San Giorgio, although also from the Lower Meride Limestone, dating to possibly the lowest Ladinian age. The species in a subtropical lagoonal environment with varying open marine influences, and alongside many related but smaller species of nothosaurids and pachypleurosaurids. Ceresiosaurus represents one of the largest vertebrate of up to 3 m snout-tail length from the very diversified paleoenvironment of the Middle Triassic Monte San Giorgio. ==Palaeobiology== Ceresiosaurus lanzi Restoration Ceresiosaurus was much more elongated than its relatives, reaching in length, and had fully developed flippers with no trace of visible toes. It had multiple elongated phalanges, making the flippers much longer than in most other nothosaurs, and more closely resembling those of the later plesiosaurs. Ceresiosaurus also had the shortest skull of any known nothosaur, which further increased its resemblance to plesiosaurs. Although possessing a long neck and tail, Ceresiosaurus may not have swum by undulating its body. Analysis of the bone structure of the hips and powerful tail suggest that it instead propelled itself through the water much like a penguin. The evidence of pachypleurosaurs in the preserved stomach of Ceresiosaurus remains lend credence to the theory of it being a fast swimmer. ==References== * Dixon, Dougal. \\"The Complete Book of Dinosaurs.\\" Hermes House, 2006. * Palaeos.com Category:Nothosaurs Category:Triassic sauropterygians Category:Middle Triassic reptiles of Europe Category:Anisian life ","title":"Ceresiosaurus"},{"id":"5563754","text":"Non-self may refer to: * Anatta, in Buddhist philosophy, the \\"non-self\\" or \\"absence of separate self\\" * A central concept, the distinction of self from non-self, in Immunology, proposed by Frank Macfarlane Burnet * Exogenous antigen, a non-self molecule that stimulates an immune response ","title":"Non-self"},{"id":"5563761","text":"Metro Transit Police may refer to: *Metro Transit Police Department in Washington, D.C. *Metropolitan Transit Police of Metro Transit in Minneapolis- St. Paul == See also == *Metro Transit (disambiguation) ","title":"Metro Transit Police"},{"id":"5563767","text":"{align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"center\\"150px - 170px } Gouverneur Kemble (January 25, 1786 ‚Äì September 18, 1875) was a two-term United States Congressman, diplomat and industrialist.

As a young man with political connections, in 1816 he was appointed United States Consul at C√°diz in Spain, where his attention was attracted to the Spanish government's state-of-the-art process of casting cannon. ==Manufacturer== Returning home, Kemble saw an opportunity to introduce the process in the United States. Along with other partners including his brother William and a consortium of investors including General Joseph Gardner Swift of the U.S. Army, around 1817 he founded the West Point Foundry Association to produce artillery pieces for the United States Government. The need of such an establishment was demonstrated by the War of 1812. The foundry was built across the Hudson River from West Point in the village of Cold Spring, New York, and soon began to make cast iron steam engines for locomotives, gears, water pipes, and other iron products, as well as artillery. Despite the lack of local artisans and craftsmen skilled in ironworking, Kemble and his partners succeeded, especially after they hired William Young, a native of Belfast, Ireland. Robert P. Parrott became superintendent in 1836 and the Foundry weathered the Panic of 1837. Kemble continued to be president of the association until the expiration of the charter. He became known as the \\"Patriarch of Cold Spring\\" for his charitable activities in the village. In 1823, Gouverneur Kemble leased land in Orange County, New York, for the mineral rights to mine iron ore. Four years later, the Kembles acquired most of the nearby Greenwood Iron Foundry and related industries. In 1839, the brothers sold the foundry to Parrott. A year later, his sister Mary married Parrott. ==Political career== Kemble was an active member of the Democratic Party. He was elected to the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Congresses representing Westchester and Putnam counties, serving two terms during the presidency of Martin Van Buren. In 1840, he declined a nomination for a third term. He served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1840 and 1860. He was elected as a delegate to the 1846 convention for the revising New York's state constitution.\\"Kemble, Gouverneur\\", Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress In his later years, he was an active supporter of the Hudson River RailroadCalver, Amelia.

Sir Roger Manwood (1525‚Äì1592) was an English jurist and Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. ==Birth== Sir Roger was the second son of Thomas Manwood (d. 1538, draper) and Katherine (d.1566, daughter of John Galloway of Cley, Norfolk). He was born in Sandwich, Kent in 1524/5. Sir Roger lived in Sandwich and then at Hackington near Canterbury. ==Education== Roger Manwood was educated at St. Peter's school, Sandwich. In 1548 he was admitted to and began his training as a barrister at the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar in 1555. ==Career== In 1555 Roger Manwood was appointed recorder of Sandwich, and became MP for Hastings. In 1557-8 he exchanged Hastings for Sandwich, which he continued to represent until 1572. He resigned the recordership of Sandwich in 1566, but acted as counsel for the town Sandwich in 1558, 1559, 1563, 1571, 1572 and until his death. He was reader at the Inner Temple in Lent 1565; his reading on the statute 21 Hen. VIII, c. 3, is extant in Harleian MS. 5265 (see also Thoresby, Ducat Leod. Cat. of MSS. in 4to, No. 119). Manwood was also, for some years prior to his elevation to the bench of the common pleas, steward, i.e. judge, of the chancery and admiralty courts of Dover. Manwood attained the highest and most prestigious order of counsel, namely serjeant-at-law. on 23 April 1567. In parliament he supported the Treason Bill of 1571, was a member of the joint committee of lords and commons to which the case of Mary, Queen of Scots was referred in May 1572, and concurred in advising her execution. On 14 October he was rewarded with a puisne judgeship of the common pleas. He was one of the original governors of Queen Elizabeth's grammar school, founded at Lewisham in 1574, and in 1575 obtained an act of parliament providing for the perpetual maintenance of Rochester bridge, which, however, did not prevent its demolition in 1856, to make way for the present iron structure. Manwood was joined with the Bishops of London and Rochester in a commission of 11 May 1575 for the examination of foreign immigrants suspected of anabaptism. The inquisition resulted in the conviction of two Flemings, John Peters and Henry Twiwert, who were burned at West Smithfield. On 23 April 1576 Manwood was placed on the high commission. By the influence of Walsingham and Hatton, Manwood was created Chief Baron of the Exchequer on 17 November 1578. He was knighted at Richmond two days before and served Queen Elizabeth I until 1592. He took his seat in the following Hilary term (Add. MS. 16169, f. 67 b). As lord chief baron Manwood was a member of the court of Star Chamber which on 15 November 1581 passed sentence of fine and imprisonment upon William, Lord Vaux of Harrowden, and other suspected harbourers of the Jesuit Edmund Campion for refusing to be examined about the matter. His judgment, in which he limits the legal maxim, 'Nemo tenetur seipsum prodere (that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against themselves),' to cases involving life or limb, is printed in 'Arch√¶ologia,' xxx. 108 et seq. (see also Hist. MSS. Comm. 11th Rep. App. pt. vii. pp. 163-5). In 1582, on the death of Sir James Dyer, chief justice of the common pleas, Manwood offered Burghley a large sum for his place, which, however, was given to Edmund Anderson. In February 1584-5 he helped to try the intended regicide William Parry, and in the following June he took part in the inquest on the death of the Earl of Northumberland in the Tower, He was a member of the special commission which, on 11 October 1586, assembled at Fotheringay for the examination of Mary, Queen of Scots, and concurred in the verdict afterwards found against her in the Star Chamber (25 October) He also sat on the commission which, on 28 March 1587, found Secretary Davison guilty of 'misprison and contempt' for his part in bringing about her execution. In 1591 he was detected in the sale of one of the offices in his gift, and sharply censured by the queen. A curious letter, in which he attempts to excuse himself by quoting precedents, is extant in Harleian MS. 6995, f. 49. This was but one of several misfeasances of various degrees of gravity with which Manwood was charged during his later years. Thomas Digges and Richard Barrey, lieutenant of Dover Castle, charged him with deliberate perversion of justice, in the chancery and admiralty courts of Dover, and the exchequer; Sir Thomas Perrot and Thomas Cheyne, with covinous pleading in the court of chancery; and Richard Rogers, suffragan bishop of Dover, with selling the queen's pardon in a murder case for ¬£240. According to Manningham (Diary, Camden Soc, p. 91), he even stooped to appropriate a gold chain which a goldsmith had placed in his hands for inspection, and on the privy council intervening by writ at the suit of the goldsmith, returned the scornful answer, 'Malas causas habentes semper fugiunt ad potentes. Ubi non valet Veritas, praevalet auctoritas. Currat lex, vivat Rex, and so fare you well my Lords.' 'But,' adds the diarist, 'he was commit.' This strange story is confirmed by extant letters of Manwood, from which it appears that he was arraigned before the privy council in April 1592, refused to recognise its jurisdiction in a contemptuous letter containing the words 'fugiunt ad potentes,' was thereupon confined in his own house in Great St. Bartholomew's by order of the council, and only regained his liberty by apologising for the obnoxious letter, and making humble submission (14 May). His disgrace, however, did not prevent his offering Burghley five hundred marks for the chief justiceship of the queen's bench, vacant by the death of Sir Christopher Wray. The bribe was not taken, and on 14 December 1592 Manwood died. The letters above referred to will be found in Lansdowne MS. 71, arts. 5, 6, 7, and 68; Harleian MS. 6995, art. 62; and Strype, 'Annals ' (fol.), iv. 119-28. Other of Manwood's letters are preserved in Egerton MS. 2713, f. 193, Additional MS. 12507, f. 130, Lansdowne MS. arts. 24 and 31, and the 'Manwood Papers' in the Inner Temple Library. His hand is one of the least legible ever written. A note of some of the charges against him in Burghley's handwriting is in Lansdowne MS. 104, art. 32 (see also Lansd. MSS. 24 art. 39, 26 art. 7). ==Marriage and family== He married firstly, Dorothy Theobald (daughter of John Theobald of Sheppey), widow of John Croke and Christopher Allen, and secondly, Elizabeth Coppinger (daughter of John Copinger, of Allhallows), widow of John Wilkins. His children with Dorothy Theobald were John and Thomas (who died young), Margaret (the first wife of Sir John Leveson), Anne (the first wife of Percival Hart), and Peter (later Sir Peter Manwood, Knight of the Bath). ==Character and Social life== At the Inner Temple revels of Christmas 1561 Manwood played the part of lord chief baron in the masque of 'Palaphilos' [cf. Hatton, Sir Christopher, 1540‚Äì1591]. As a judge he was by no means disposed to minimise his jurisdiction, advised that the Treason Act did not supersede, but merely reinforced the common law, and that a lewd fellow, whom neither the pillory nor the loss of his ears could cure of speaking evil of the queen, might be punished either with imprisonment for life 'with all extremity of irons, and other strait feeding and keeping,' or by burning in the face or tongue, or public exposure, 'with jaws gagged in painful manner,' or excision of the tongue. He also held that non-attendance at church was punishable by fine, and favoured a rigorous treatment of puritans. Nevertheless, he seems to have been popular on circuit, Southampton conferring upon him its freedom on 28 March 1577. He was a friend of Sir Thomas Gresham and Archbishop Matthew Parker, and steward of the liberties to the latter, in concert with whom he founded at Sandwich the grammar school which still bears his name. It was said of Manwood ... ==Notable Quotes== Of the four high courts of justice: Of 'corporations': ==Philanthropy== Sir Roger provided a significant amount of money for the foundation in 1563 of Sir Roger Manwood's School in Sandwich, Kent, a free grammar school to bring education to the townspeople whose families could not afford it. This was done in concert with Sir Thomas Gresham and Archbishop Parker, and Parker's \\"steward of the liberties\\". It took the place of St. Peter's school, which had been suppressed in 1547 with the chantry of St. Thomas, to which it was attached. The school was built on a site near Canterbury Gate, and endowed partly out of Manwood's own funds and money bequeathed him for the purpose, partly by public subscription between 1563 and 1583. Besides his school, he built a house of correction in Westgate, Canterbury, gave St. Stephen's Church a new peal of bells and a new transept‚Äîthat under which he was buried ‚Äî and procured in 1588 a substantial augmentation of the living. In the 1570s Manwood built seven almshouses on St Stephen's Green in the vicinity of the church. Each of the six residents enjoyed one meal a week in Manwood's own house. In his will the servants were generously treated. Those who had served Manwood for more than seven years received annuities of up to ¬£10. Others could stay at St. Stephen‚Äôs for a year after his death while they looked, if they chose, for suitable posts elsewhere. One bequest of ¬£20 in his will was for the local poor for the relief of those afflicted by the plague. ==Connections with Queen Elizabeth== Roger Manwood attracted the favourable notice of the queen who in 1563 granted him the royal manor of St. Stephen's, or Hackington, Kent, which he made his principal seat, rebuilding the house in \\"magnificent\\" style. Queen Elizabeth lodged in Manwood's house near Sandwich in 1572, where Henry VIII had also previously been lodged. ==Death== Sir Roger died on 14 December 1592. He was buried beneath an imposing marble monument, erected during his lifetime, in the south transept of St. Stephen's Church, near Canterbury. The monument was designed by Maximilian Colte (who later designed the famous tomb of Queen Elizabeth I in Westminster Abbey). It depicts snakes either side of his head, and his firm grasp on a money bag. Around his neck hangs a chain known by scholars as the \\"SS collar\\" (as has the effigy of Henry IV in Canterbury Cathedral). The tomb also depicts Manwood's wives and children, and incorporates a wooded skeleton claimed to be the most realistic in the county. Christopher Marlowe, the well-known Elizabethan playwright and poet, wrote a eulogy in Latin hexameter after Manwood's death, entitled 'On the Death of Sir Roger Manwood' (cf. Works of Christopher Marlowe, ed. Dyce, iii. 308). The eulogy was discovered by J.P. Collier in the nineteenth-century, in a common- place book (\\"Miscellanea\\", 1640's, now Folger MS. 750.1) which was owned by another Kentish gentleman, Henry Oxinden. The author is documented as being 'C.M.'. When translated to English, the meaning is not straightforward, and probably has elements of Latin wordplay. It has been described in various sections as ambivalent, ambiguous, conventionally eulogistic, cryptic, and even sarcastic. > In obitum honoratissimi viri Rogeri Manwood militis quaestorii Reginalis > Capitalis Baronis Noctivagi terror, ganeonis triste flagellum, Et Jovis > Alcides, rigido vulturque latroni, Urna subtegitur. Scelerum gaudete > Nepotes. Insons, luctifica sparsis cervice capillis Plange, fori lumen, > venerandae gloria legis, Occidit: heu, secum effoetas Acherontis ad oras > Multa abiit virtus.

An inquisition post mortem was taken about two and a half years later, 25 May 1595. ==Connections to Christopher Marlowe== The epitaph raises the question of why Marlowe should write his only known Latin poem in Manwood's memory. There are a few links. Roger Manwood was one of the judges involved in Marlowe's trial, in December 1589, for the murder of a man. In September 1589 Christopher Marlowe and his friend and fellow dramatist, Thomas Watson, were involved in an affray which resulted in the death of one William Bradley. Thomas Watson and \\"Christoferus Marlowe nuper de [Norton Fowlgate] yoman\\" were arrested and committed to Newgate prison on 18 September 1589, on suspicion of the murder of William Bradley in Hog Lane in the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate. The inquest on Bradley's death was held the following day, but it was only nearly two weeks later, on 1 October, that \\"Christopher Marley of London, gentleman\\" was bailed. His sureties for the sum of ¬£40 were \\"Richard Kytchine of Clifford's Inne, gentleman, & Humfrey Rowland of East Smithfeilde in the county aforesaid, horner\\". \\"Marlowe and Watson appeared at 'Justice hall in Le Olde Bailie' on December 3, 1589. On the bench sat the Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Harte; Chief Justices Wray of the Queen's Bench and Anderson of the Common Pleas; the Master of the Rolls, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, representing Chancery; Sir Roger Manwood, 15 Chief Baron of the Exchequer; Sir Rowland Heyward and Sir George Bond, Aldermen; Serjeant Fleetwood, Recorder of London; Robert Wroth, esquire etc \\". Watson was subsequently found to have killed Bradley in self-defence, and Marlowe was duly discharged. Roger Manwood was a friend of Matthew Parker, whose 'Parker scholarship' gave financial support to recipients studying at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Marlowe first entered Kings School, Canterbury, on 14 January 1579. A year later, reputedly under the Matthew Parker Scholarship, he entered Corpus Christi College to study for his MA. The Parker scholarship was restricted to a native of Canterbury, and was for those \\"poor boys, both destitute of the help of friends, and endowed with minds apt for learning\\" who had attended the King's School, Canterbury. Marlowe obtained his bachelor of arts degree in 1584. But Marlowe's scholarship continued and by 1587 Marlowe had held the scholarship for virtually the maximum permitted duration. In 1587, however, the university hesitated about granting him the master‚Äôs degree; its doubts (arising from his frequent absences from the university) were apparently set at rest when the Privy Council sent a letter declaring that he had been employed ‚Äúon matters touching the benefit of his country‚Äù. Parker was master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (1544 to 1553), and vice chancellor of the University of Cambridge (1545, 1549). He was later Archbishop of Canterbury (1559-75) under Queen Elizabeth I. Roger Manwood's family was connected with the theatre scene of London, of which Marlowe was a notable figure. Manwood's daughter Margaret was the first wife of Sir John Leveson. John Leveson's younger brother, William Leveson, acted as trustee to the Lord Chamberlain‚Äôs Men, including William Shakespeare of Stratford upon Avon, in the allocation of shares in the ground lease of the Globe Theatre in 1599. Whilst the documented family connection is seven years after Manwood's death, and therefore somewhat tenuous, it is possible that Manwood had prior involvement himself. ==Richard and John Manwood== He is apparently sometimes mistakenly referred to as \\"Richard Manwood\\" (e.g. in the biography of Richard Boyle). He was a close relative, probably uncle, of John Manwood, a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, gamekeeper of Waltham Forest, and Justice in Eyre of the New Forest under Elizabeth I of England. ==References== Category:1525 births Category:1592 deaths Category:English barristers Category:English judges Category:Chief Barons of the Exchequer Category:People from Canterbury Category:People from Sandwich, Kent Category:Serjeants-at-law (England) Category:Justices of the Common Pleas Category:16th-century English lawyers Category:English MPs 1555 Category:English MPs 1558 Category:English MPs 1559 Category:English MPs 1563‚Äì1567 Category:English MPs 1571 Category:English MPs 1572‚Äì1583 Category:16th-century English judges ","title":"Roger Manwood"},{"id":"5563781","text":"Burgst√§dt () is a town in the district of Mittelsachsen, in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

Fossils have been found in France and Germany, and date to the Middle Triassic. It contains a single species, Pistosaurus longaevus. Pistosaurus is known as the oldest \\"subaquatic flying\\" reptile on earth. The skull of Pistosaurus is generally resembles that of other Triassic sauropterygians. However, there are several synapomorphies that make Pistosaurus distinguished: the long, slender, snout; the possession of splint-like nasals that are excluded from the external naris; and the posterior extension of the premaxilla to the frontals.Krahl, Anna, et al. \\"Evolutionary Implications of the Divergent Long Bone Histologies of Nothosaurus and Pistosaurus (Sauropterygia, Triassic).\\" BMC Evolutionary Biology, vol. 13, 2013, p. 123. Based on synapomorphies such as the small nasals size and the presence of interpterygoid vacuity, Pistosaurus is more closely related to Plesiosauria than to Nothosaurus. Pistosaurus is often mistaken with Nothosaurus and Plesiosauria. Nothosaurus belongs to the clade Nothosauroidea from the middle Triassic (approximately 199-251 million years ago); while Pistosaurus belongs to stem group Plesiosauria; and both Pistosaurus and Plesiosauria belongs to clade Pistosauroidea from Triassic. Both Nothosauroidea and Pistosauroidea belong to Sauropterygia. == Description and paleobiology == Restoration of Pistosaurus longaevus Pistosaurus was about long, and had a body form resembling that of nothosaurs, aquatic reptiles that flourished during the Triassic. However, the vertebral column was stiff, like that of a plesiosaur, implying that the animal used its paddle-like flippers to propel itself through the water, as the plesiosaurs probably did. The head also resembled that of a plesiosaur, but with the primitive palate of a nothosaur, and numerous, sharp teeth ideal for catching and eating fish.  Post-cranial skeleton  The description below is based on the specimen examined by paleontologist Sues in 1987.  Pectoral girdle and forelimbs  The structure of pectoral girdle and humerus are used to support the anterior part of the body.Sues, H.-D. \\"Postcranial Skeleton of Pistosaurus and Interrelationships of the Sauropterygia (Diapsida.\\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, vol. 90, no. 2, 1987, pp. 109‚Äì131. The scapula in pectoral girdle of Pistosaurus consists with a massive body and a short posterodorsal process. It is smaller in size compared to coracoid. And its lateral margin of the body is gently convex anteroposteriorly while the medial margin is more strongly convex. The coracoid bone of Pistosaurus is flat and expanded medially. The glenoid region is similar to Nothosaurus in development: both the slight notching of its margin and a distinct facet contact with the humeral head. There is also a ridge like thickening which links the glenoid to posteromedial region of the coracoid. This feature is a synapomorphy that appears in plesiosaurs, which is a thickened ridge passes transversely across the anterior portion of the coracoid to connect the glenoid region. This feature is suggested related to compressional force by limb motion in Pistosaurus. A specimen of the left humerus of Pistosaurus analyzed by Paleontologist A.R.I. Cruickshank is one of the largest specimens recorded: 245mm long and 45mm wide at the mid-shaft.Cruickshank, A. \\"A Pistosaurus-like Sauropterygian from the Rhaeto-Hettangian of England.\\" Mercian Geologist, vol. 14, no. 1, 1996, pp. 12‚Äì13. The specimen showing that the axis of Pistosaurus humerus is straight, with the distal end slightly expanded posteriorly. From proximal view, the head of the humerus is concave, which is a sign of a substantial cap of cartilage at the head of humerus. The humerus of Pistosaurus also lacks entepicondylar foramen. Pistosaurus has a strongly flattened ulna. It has medium length and nearly symmetrical in dorsal view. Its anterior margin is more curved and thicker than the posterior one. This feature broads the wide spatium interosseum enclosed between radius and ulna. The proximal end of radius is less expanded than that of ulna, while the distal end is less expanded than proximal one but thickened. The anterior margin is nearly straight while the posterior margin is more curved compared to the anterior one. Like other sauropterygians, the radius of Pistosaurus is slightly longer than the ulna.  Pelvic girdle  The pelvic girdle of Pistosaurus is more similar to primitive sauropterygians than to plesiosaurs. The ilium of Pistosaurus has an iliac blade, which has almost parallel anterior and posterior margins. Same as other non-plesiosaur sauropterygians, the ilium in Pistosaurus contacts both the pubis and the ischium, forming a ring-like structure. The ilium from Pistosaurus is relatively large in size compared to Nothosaurus, whose ilia did not appear to have any elongated blade. The femur of Pistosaurus is longer than its humerus. Its anterior margin is almost straight whereas the posterior margin is concave. According to the specimen provided by paleontologist Sues, the proximal articular end is much more robust than the distal one, and is more or less triangular in transverse section. ==Classification== Limb bone Although it is unlikely that Pistosaurus was a direct ancestor of the plesiosaurs, the mixture of features suggests that it was closely related to that group. The following cladogram follows an analysis by Ketchum & Benson, 2011. The classification for Plesiosauria was difficult at the first place. The anatomy of stem group Sauropterygia has very primitive synapomorphies such as dermal palate. Initially, Plesiosauria were suggested related to Pistosauroidea, which belongs to Eusauropterygia from Triassic. Three genera of Plesiosauria was known in the history: Corosaurus alvocensis, Cymatosaurus, and Pistosaurus longaevus.Rieppel, Olivier, et al. \\"The Skull of the Pistosaur Augustasaurus from the Middle Triassic of Northwestern Nevada.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, vol. 22, no. 3, 2002, pp. 577‚Äì592. A later discovery of a new Pistosauridea from middle triassic of Nevada by paleontologist Sander indicates that Augustasaurus is closely related to Pistosaurus, while there are several difference including axial skeleton.Sander, P. Martin, et al. \\"A New Pistosaurid (Reptilia: Sauropterygia) from the Middle Triassic of Nevada and Its Implications for the Origin of the Plesiosaurs.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, vol. 17, no. 3, 1997, pp. 526‚Äì533. == Geological environment information == There are several different ways for aquatic tetrapod to counteract their positive buoyancy caused by their lungs: pachyostosis, osteosclerosis, pachyosteosclerosis, and calcified cartilage of bone. The ultimate goal of these processes are to increase density for different parts of the body to offset the buoyancy, in order to live in an aquatic/semi-aquatic environment. Bone histology of Pistosaurus longaevus studied by Paleontologist Krahl showed that the medullary region of humeri was filled, and it contained calcified cartilage incorporated into endoseal bone. According to Krahl, the small region of medullary of humeri is results from a suppressed perimedullary resorption activity, which is associated with osteosclerosis. Paleontologist Diedrich examined other pectoral and pelvic girdle of Pistosaurus. Together with the muscle grooves, they determined that a slight subaquatic flying starts with Pistosaurus. And most of the propulsion occurs on the hindlimbs. The presence of enlarged corocoid and pubis bone in pelvic girdle indicated that there were possibility for Pistosaurus to develop flipper-like extremities.Diedrich, Cajus G., et al. \\"The Oldest \\"Subaquatic Flying\\" Reptile in the World; Pistosaurus Longaevus Meyer, 1839 (Sauropterygia) from the Middle Triassic of Europe.\\" Bulletin of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, vol. 61, 2013, pp. 169‚Äì215. What's more, the underwater flying mode suggested by paleontologist Michael. A. Taylor indicates that the left and right limb of Plesiosaurus would simultaneously beat together. This feature contrasts to the terrestrial reptile who use right and left limbs for locomotion alternatively.Taylor, Michael A. \\"Palaeontology; Sea-Saurians for Sceptics.\\" Nature (London), vol. 338, no. 6217, 1989, pp. 625‚Äì626. == Historical information and discovery == The non-Plesiosaurian Sauropterygians are found in various locations in China, Europe, America, Israel as well as Tunisia. Although Nothosaurus, which is closely related to Pistosaurus, are found plenty across Europe, Pistosaurus skull is only found in Germanic basin in Upper Muschelkalk. The early discovery of Pistosaurus skull was by H. v. Meyer. He discovered two skulls and a postcranial skeleton at the same location, possibly from Pistosaurus. Later after that, a new and well preserved postcranial skeleton was also found at the same location as previous specimens.Huene, F. V. \\"Pistosaurus, a Middle Triassic Plesiosaur.\\" American Journal of Science, vol. 246, no. 1, 1948, pp. 46‚Äì52. Paleontologist Geissler first described the skeletons and then paleontologist Strunz developed new hypothesis based on that. This skeleton was originally preserved at Strunz collection in Senckenberg Museum at Frankfurt a/M. Although Pistosauroidea has long been considered as structural antecedents of Plesiosauria, a new specimen of Augustasaurus discovered by paleontologist Sandra from Nevada had raised to against this theory. Opposed to previous hypothesis, the forelimb of Augustasaurus was greatly reduced compared to Plesiosaurus. Therefore, Pistosauroidea was removed from stem group Plesiosauria and becomes paraphyletic group to Plesiosauria. Avascular necrosis, also known as bone necrosis, is associated with decompression syndrome (DCS). It is caused by expose rapid decrease of external pressure as well as rapid ascent in water column.Surmik, Dawid, et al. \\"Two Types of Bone Necrosis in the Middle Triassic Pistosaurus Longaevus Bones: the Results of Integrated Studies.\\" Royal Society Open Science, vol. 4, no. 7, 2017, pp. Royal Society Open Science, 2017, Vol.4(7). There features are often recognized in Triassic Sauropterygians. According to paleontologist Surmik, the presence of decompression syndrome-related avascular necrosis in Pistosaurus forelimb suggested that Pistosaurus used to live in aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. He also stated the possibility of Pistosaurus distributed in open marine cold water, and their effective metabolism is one of the reasons why Pistosaurus can survive the open sea. ==References== Category:Middle Triassic reptiles of Europe Category:Triassic plesiosaurs Category:Aquatic reptiles Category:Prehistoric reptile genera ","title":"Pistosaurus"},{"id":"5563852","text":"Northwest Harbor may refer to: *Northwest Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland *Northwest Harbor, New York, census-designated place on Long Island *Northwest Harbor Bay, New York, a bay on Long Island ","title":"Northwest Harbor"},{"id":"5563875","text":"Krumbach (also: Krumbach (Schwaben)) is a town with 13,000 residents in the district G√ºnzburg in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is the second biggest town in the district. ==Geography== Krumbach (elevation 512 m (1680 ft)) is situated in Mittelschwaben in the natural region Lower Iller-Lech Gravel Plateau (a part of the region between Danube and the Alps) in the valley of the Kammel, a left tributary of the Mindel river and so an indirect tributary of the Danube river. The landscape is marked by forests and areas in agricultural acreage (fields and grassland). The next bigger cities respectively towns are Ulm, approximately 40 kilometres northwest of Krumbach, Augsburg, 48 kilometres northeast of Krumbach, Memmingen, about 40 km kilometres southwest of Krumbach, Mindelheim, 30 kilometres south of Krumbach and G√ºnzburg, 27 kilometres north of Krumbach. The distance to Munich is approximately 120 kilometres. ==History== In 1156 Krumbach was mentioned in documents the first time, in 1370 the village got the right to hold a market. From 1305 until 1805 Krumbach was part of the Margraviate of Burgau, which was part of the Habsburg Further Austria. In the year 1805 Krumbach became Bavarian by the Peace of Pressburg. 90 years later Krumbach became a town. In the year 1902 the previously independent municipality H√ºrben, a neighbouring village of Krumbach, merged into Krumbach. Until the time of the Third Reich H√ºrben had a high percentage of Jewish residents in comparison to the Bavarian average. Until 1972 Krumbach was the district seat of the administrative district Krumbach (Swabia). Bavarian regional reforms merged the previously independent municipalities of Hohenraunau (1972/01/01), Billenhausen with Hirschfelden (1972/07/01), Edenhausen with the Krumbad (1973/01/01), Attenhausen (1977/01/01) and Niederraunau (1978/05/01) into Krumbach. The Krumbad is a health resort approximately one kilometre east of Krumbach. It is the oldest health resort of Swabia. ==Coat of arms== The colours of the town (red and white) as well as the arms (a silver-coloured wavy thick line in red) remind one on the one hand of the long affiliation to Further Austria on the other hand it is a canting arms ‚Äì the crooked stream. In this context it is important to know, that the meander of the Kammel are clearly distinct. ==Attractions== * market place and historic town hall * church St Michael * church St Ulrich in H√ºrben * church Maria Hilf * church Lindlkirche * M√ºhlkapelle * castle of Krumbach * moated castle of H√ºrben * Landauer Haus * Middleswabian lokal heritage museum * waxart museum MORSA * Krumbad * church of Niederraunau * castle of Niederraunau * Dossenberger Pfarrhof (parsonage) Billenhausen File:KRU-St-Michael.jpgChurch St Michael File:KRU- MuehlK01.jpgM√ºhlkapelle File:Krumbach centrum.JPGMarket place and historic town hall File:KRU-WaSchl01.jpgCastle of H√ºrben File:KRU-KruBad03.jpgKrumbad ==Economy and Traffic and Public Institutions== In Krumbach there are car suppliers, a paintfactory, plant construction factories, weaving mills, waxfactories and a wall-to-wall carpeting factory. Two Bundesstra√üen pass Krumbach: the Bundesstra√üe 16 (B 16) G√ºnzburg-Mindelheim and the Bundesstra√üe 300 (B 300) Memmingen-Augsburg. The distances to the Autobahnen 7, 8 and 96 are each approximately 25 kilometres. Furthermore, Krumbach has a railway station at the railway from G√ºnzburg to Mindelheim (Mittelschwaben Railway), a loop line, which connects the main lines Bavarian Maximilian Railway (Munich- Augsburg-Ulm-Stuttgart) and the railway from Munich to Zurich via Buchloe, Memmingen and Lindau (Bodensee). In Krumbach there are quite a few public institutions: police station, forestry commission office, planning department and several schools: secondary schools, grammar school and vocational schools; ==Miscellaneous== In the valley of G√ºnz ‚Äì approximately six kilometres west of Krumbach there is the Oberrieder Weiher, a flooded gravel pit and popular greenbelt recreation area.

Localities indicate cleaner creams to the west, dirty creams to the east and north, and said creams turning yellow becoming orange the more south. The underside of annulata is checkered black and white in correlation to the overhead banding, with southern localities having higher concentrations of black and northern localities having more white.http://www.wildlifenorthamerica.com/Reptile/Mexican-Milk- Snake/Lampropeltis/triangulum-annulata.html This subspecies can be differentiated from other milk snakes due to the darker light bands which display at the very lightest: a cream yellow color at the first light band following the black head (darker cream than other subspecies), with the rest of the light banding being solid cream. The very darkest light bands will display: a bright yellow or orange-yellow color following the first light band adjacent to the black head, with the rest of the light banding being a lighter hue of either yellow, cream-yellow, or orange-yellow. Other milk snake subspecies may have darker light banding depending on the individual snake, however, and as described, the Mexican milk snake has a much higher prevalence of this trait, along with other distinctive features. The light bands are typically considerably larger than the black bands, and broaden/widen towards the lower sides and ventral scales from the dorsal scales. Additional distinguishing features include all localities having red bands which are especially dark and crisp compared to other subspecies, with the red being around two or three times as wide as the black bands, and the red extending from the sides to the very edge of the ventral scales. The Mexican milk snake is fairly short in length and large in width compared to other milk snake subspecies, given that they grow to approximately 24‚Äì30 inches (61‚Äì76 cm) in length, and that they have more girth overall.http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Snake-Species/Mexican-Milk-Snake/ It is not venomous, contrary to the coral snake which appears fairly similar to this milk snake. The coral snake's red and yellow bands are adjacent, while the milk snake's red and black bands are adjacent. Distinguishing between the two, therefore, is often taught with the mnemonic device \\"red touches/on black, friend of Jack; red touches/on yellow, kill a fellow\\". (A variation is: \\"Red on yellow kills a fellow. Red on black venom lack.\\")http://www.wildlife- removal.com/snakecolorrhyme.html == Behavior == Mexican milk snakes are generally nocturnal as well as crepuscular, and prefer to hide when the temperatures are higher, becoming most active in the cooler periods of the spring and fall. They eat primarily rodents and lizards, yet will occasionally eat other snakes. As with all Lampropeltis genus snakes, however, they will eat most if not all appropriately (or reasonably) sized animals they encounter if voracious enough. Their choice of habitat is semi-arid brush areas, with sandy soils. While these snakes are primarily nocturnal and crepuscular as stated, they will occasionally bask for short periods during the day, and in captivity, if provided with a basking lamp.http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Snake-Species/Mexican-Milk-Snake/ Breeding occurs on rainy spring evenings, and approximately 50 days later, the female will lay 4‚Äì10 eggs which will incubate for 55‚Äì60 days before hatching. Newborns are around 6‚Äì7 inches (15‚Äì17 cm) long.http://www.livingdesert.org/animal/mexican-milk-snake/ == In captivity == The Mexican milk snake adapts well to captive care, and its smaller size and interesting coloration can make it an attractive choice for a pet snake.

This same line of ridges divides Fresno County and Kings Canyon National Park to the west, from Inyo County and the Inyo National Forest to the east. The water divide of its ridges drain to the Kings River to the west, and the Owens River to the east. The two toned appearance of the mountain's eastern face is created by a roof pendant of darker colored granodiorite atop a lighter colored body of leucogranite. ==History== The name Split Mountain, inspired by the shape of its double summit, was first coined by mountaineer Bolton Brown in 1895. Alternately, it has been called Southeast Palisade or South Palisade. ==Climbing== Split Mountain is one of the easier California fourteeners to climb. The least technical route is the class 2 north slope, which can be approached from the west or east. Joseph LeConte, Helen LeConte and Curtis Lindley took the simple western approach from Upper Basin when they climbed Split Mountain on July 23, 1902.

(trans. by Jonathan Uhlaner). Rafik Schami ‚Äì Exile in his homeland. Goethe Institut. 23 June 1946) is a Syrian-German author, storyteller and critic. ==Biography== Born in Syria in 1946, Schami is the son of a baker from a Syriac-Christian family. His family originated from the town of Maaloula. After attending a monastery boarding school in Lebanon, he studied chemistry, mathematics, and physics in Damascus. In 1970, left Syria for Lebanon to evade censorship and the military draft; the following year, he moved to Germany. There, Schami continued his studies in chemistry while working odd jobs, obtaining a doctorate in 1979. From 1965, Schami began writing stories in Arabic. From 1964-70 he was the co- founder and editor of the wall news-sheet Al-Muntalak (The Starting-Point) in the old quarter of Damascus. Later in Germany, in his spare time, he co- founded the literary group S√ºdwind in 1980 and was part of the PoLiKunst movement. Schami became a full-time author in 1982. He currently lives in the city of Kirchheimbolanden with his Bavarian wife and son and he holds dual citizenship. Schami's books have been translated into 29 languages. ==Assessment== Syrian-born Rafik Schami rates as one of the leading figures of German migrant literature. ‚ÄúGuest-workers‚Äù, mainly from Turkey, began to arrive in Germany in 1960, and by 1968 they numbered over 150,000. A distinctive migrant literature began to emerge significantly as a result of both Schami‚Äôs own writing and his role as a facilitator for other writers. In 1980 he co-founded the literary groups S√ºdwind (South Wind) and PoLiKunst (Polynationaler Literatur- und Kunstverein; Polynational Literary and Art Society), which encouraged all forms of migrant cultural production. Typical themes of migrant literature are conditions in the homeland and life as an alien in Germany. Both of these are to be found in Schami's works, but unlike many migrant writings in German, they never degenerate into a lament on the difficulties of the foreign worker or an expos√© of German xenophobia. Rather, a sympathy and tolerance for cultural diversity. Mostly they are set in Damascus, occasionally in Maaloula, the village the author's family originates from. They describe life in the Arab world for the benefit of the western reader, providing factual information and offering insights into aspects of daily life. In the process, they quietly undermine all kinds of prejudice. The short novel Eine Hand voller Sterne (1987; A Hand Full of Stars), which contains many autobiographical elements, is a good example of this. It takes the form of the diary of a Damascene youth, following his progress through school, work, and family life, and featuring the themes of friendship and first love in a difficult situation of social conflict. Without ever appearing didactic, it educates the reader to an awareness of the richness of life in a foreign culture. Important here is the differentiating presentation of the Arab world which militates against the homogeneity of western perceptions. Like the author, the diary-writer stands in the Christian tradition: not all Arabs are Muslims. Cultural and religious diversity in Syria is a key theme in the book, for example in the riddle of the \\"madman\\", which can only be solved by the co-operation of all the communities in Damascus. The story \\"Nuh, mein Freund\\" (\\"My Friend Nuh\\") in the collection Der Fliegenmelker (1985; The Fly Milker) deals with the young man's discovery of an affection for the Kurdish minority. If the fiction set in Syria presents a positive view of Arab family and social structures, it frequently contains critical comment on Damascene politics, on corruption, censorship, issues of civil and human rights. It was because of these problems that Schami himself left Syria and was unable to return. A Hand Full of Stars is again a good example, charting as it does the growing political awareness of the boy as he discovers journalism as a form of civil resistance. The story \\"Als der Angstmacher Angst bekam\\" (\\"When the Fear- maker became Afraid\\") in Der Fliegenmelker takes a malicious delight in the downfall of a government informer, a stock figure in Schami's Damascene fiction. Other texts speak of the fear of police brutality, skepticism vis √† vis government propaganda and disillusionment as a series of coups fail to bring political change. By contrast Schami has a generally positive view of Germany. In interviews and speeches he warns against undercurrents of intolerance but speaks optimistically of the Germans as a people well-placed precisely because of their history to embrace foreign elements. Some stories dealing generally with intolerance and injustice could certainly be read in the context of migrant workers in Germany. One commentator interprets the title story of Das Letzte Wort der Wanderratte (1984; The Itinerant Rat's Last Word) in this way: rats = guest-workers, humans = Germans, massacre of Hamelin rats = Holocaust; the interpretation is possible but not necessary. Similarly the title story of Das Schaf im Wolfpelz (1982; Sheep in Wolf's Clothing) and many others which very obviously contain a social moral could certainly be taken to address the situation in Germany but could be equally applicable in Syria or elsewhere. The story \\"Vampire lieben Knoblauch\\" (\\"Vampires Love Garlic\\") in Das Letzte Wort der Wanderratte tells how G√ºnter with his crucifix and Ali with his crescent are equally helpless victims of the predator, Dracula; it is a mistake to seek anti-German polemic in Schami's writing. His sharpest criticism is directed against the principle of assimilation, with its implication that outsiders settling in Germany should abandon their own cultural identity. In the story \\"Als der Meister auftrat\\" (\\"When the Master Entered\\") in Das Letzte Wort der Wanderratte, the migrant worker Hassan has himself transformed into a Siegfried, only to discover that the deception is untenable. The magician who sells him his German skin is named Gnussapna - an inversion of Anpassung, assimilation. As an alternative the story speaks of bridge-building, the disarming of prejudices in both communities. Against the pressure for ethnic minorities to become invisible, Schami champions the concept of a boldly multicultural society, which indeed was the basic ideal of the PoLiKunst movement. A fine expression of the importance of co-existence is the parable \\"Der Wald und das Streichholz\\" (\\"The Forest and the Matchstick\\") in Der Fliegenmelker: if the pines and the olives each hope the match will burn the others, it will burn them all. The overriding characteristic of Schami's style is its affinity to the oral tradition of Arabic story-telling: one could speak of an integration of Arabic and German narrative traditions. Most of his books are collections of stories, while the novels abound in echoes of the Arabian Nights, even in the titles of Erz√§hler der Nacht (1989; Damascus Nights) or Der ehrliche L√ºgner (1992; The Honest Liar), is subtitled: Roman von tausendundeiner L√ºge (Novel of 1001 Lies). Both are structured as a series of inserted stories presented orally by protagonists within a narrative framework. Damascus Nights in particular is a story about story-telling. Vom Zauber der Zunge (1991; On the Magic of the Tongue) gives an account of the background to it. Schami began as a child telling stories to his friends on the streets of Damascus, and his promotional appearances are less public readings than free retellings of his works. Story-tellers are favorite protagonists. One consequence of this is that the target audience is extremely fluid: while some of his works are clearly published as children's literature (picture books, cassettes), the distinction between youth, young adult and adult literature is not easily made; traditional story-telling addresses the entire community at once. The interplay of truth and fiction, always difficult concepts, is a recurring theme in Schami's writings. Der ehrliche L√ºgner opens with the words: \\"My name is Sadik, but not even that is certain.\\" Elsewhere we are told that the important thing is not whether stories are true, but rather how we live with them (A Hand Full of Stars). Although elements from fairy- tale worlds may appear in these stories, they are always rooted in daily life. Schami has made a distinction between Illusion and Phantasie (illusion and vision). Illusion is an unachievable dream, distorting the world to something impossible, whereas vision is the imaginative construction of achievable goals; rooted in reality it indicates something which can be striven for, but this reality means also accepting the other possibility, that there may not be a happy ending. Asked by a radio interviewer whether literature is an escape from reality, Schami answers, yes: but one which enables the reader to return to reality better equipped. ==Literary prizes== *Adelbert-von-Chamisso- F√∂rderpreis 1985; *Thadd√§us-Troll-Preis des F√∂rderkreises deutscher Schriftsteller in Baden-W√ºrttemberg 1986; *ZDF-Leseratten-Preis 1987; *Z√ºrcher Kinder- und Jugendbuchpreis \\"La vache qui lit\\" 1987; *Die blaue Brillenschlange 1987; *Jenny-Smelik-Kiggen Preis 1989; *√ñsterreicher Staatspreis (Austrian State Press) Ehrenliste 1989; *Rattenf√§nger-Preis der Stadt Hameln 1990; *Phantastikpreis der Stadt Wetzlar 1990; *Mildred L.

Publication His station commander, Group Captain Claude Hilton Keith, found a letter among the missing airman's personal possessions. It had been left open, so that it could be passed by the censor. Keith was so moved by the letter that, with the mother's permission, it was anonymously published in The Times on 18 June 1940. The letter Reaction to the letter The Times was inundated with over 10,000 requests for copies of the letter in the first few days after publication.

This unique variation on the 4-bar linkage delivers progressive suspension whereby the ride becomes firmer as the shock is depressed. The shock is not attached directly to the static part of the frame at any point, hence 'floating'. *Adjustable Wheel Base on 12 mm Thru-Axle. This axle setup features on the DHExtreme-8, Europa DS (12 mm version), Europa FS, and Triton DH. The Wheelbase can be adjusted horizontally by 1 inch to effect the handling of the bike. The axle is tightened with a 9 m allen key and memory locked with two smaller horizontal allen bolts, creating a very stiff wheelbase. The disk-brake mount and derailleur hanger make up either side of the moving section, and can therefore be replaced if damaged. ==External links== *Official Website: Cortina Cycles *Archived Review of DHExtreme-8 at Mountain Bike Action (2000) from Waybackmachine *Cortina Team Profile and Info at SponsorHouse.com *Reviews of several Cortina frames at Mountain Bike Review (mtbr.com) Category:Cycle manufacturers of the United States Category:Mountain bike manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies based in California Category:Companies based in Santa Barbara, California Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1955 Category:1955 establishments in California Category:American companies established in 1955 ","title":"Cortina Cycles"},{"id":"5564001","text":"Thunderbolt Peak is a peak in the Palisades group of peaks in the Sierra Nevada in the U.S. state of California.

It is located at 2158 St. Laurent Blvd and represents around 210 students from Kindergarten to Grade Eight from over 50 countries around the world. Hawthorne Public School is home to many programs, including English as a Second Language (ESL), the General Learning Program (GLP), Special Education (SELC) and the Gifted Program. ==History== Hawthorne has a history that dates back to 1859, when the settlers of Green's Corners, a farming village southeast of Ottawa, built a small log schoolhouse.Tweedsmuir History, Hawthorne Women's Institute, c. 1945 It was replaced in 1873 by a wood-frame structure, and probably became known as the Graham Schoolhouse.Gloucester Township Council Minutes, December 7, 1874 In 1873, the village postmaster chose to rename the village \\"Hawthorne,\\" but it is not known exactly when the name became attached to the schoolhouse, which had also been known as School Section # 16 (SS #16) since 1859. It is clear that by the time that a new, red-brick building was constructed by John Alexander in 1899, it was called Hawthorne Public School. Each of the three schoolhouses had been in slightly different locations within the village, which was centred on the intersection of Walkley, Russell and Hawthorne Roads. The one-room schoolhouse of 1899 served the area until January 1961, when the current two-storey, multi-classroom school opened on St. Laurent Blvd. to serve what was by then a burgeoning suburb. The official opening was held in February 1963.Ottawa Journal, February 12, 1963 The school initially included Grades 1 through 6, but in 1968 a new wing opened for Grade 7 and 8 students. ==Athletics== Hawthorne is known for its strong athletic program. In the City Wide Regional AthleticmOlympics, Hawthorne has won several times. This is mainly attributed to Hawthorne's strong gifted program, with the only competition being Glashan and Katimavik Public School. For the past two years, Hawthorne has sent a team to the provincial Athletic Olympics. For the past several years, Hawthorne has also sent many students to the Regional Nationals Olympics, with many award recipients. Hawthorne has also sent some teams to the All Science Challenge, a local science-trivia competition between citywide grade 7s and 8s. However, due to the lack of high schools with a gifted program near the school, most children coming out of the gifted program end up using cross-boundary transfers to attend other schools. High schools that Hawthorne students attend after graduation include Lisgar, Bell, Merivale, Colonel By, Canterbury, Hillcrest, and Ridgemont. In 2007 a book called Hawthorne Writes was published with the help of fundraising and donations from the families of children involved with the project. The book featured stories written by students of Hawthorne in the format of the popular series \\"Chicken Soup.\\" Stories in the book came from a large array of grades from grade 1 to grade 8, with stories written by faculty as well. The stories were then translated into many different languages by parents, teachers and students in order to promote and display the school's multiculturalism. After completing their stories students were able to choose an available language to translate their story into. Languages included English, Somali, Arabic, French, Chinese, Spanish, and Romanian. Media coverage was present from many different stations. Every student got to take home a copy of the Hawthorne Writes book in exchange for a donation of $8 or more (although the donation was technically optional, it was encouraged nonetheless). == Athletics == Hawthorne Public School had a streak from 2001-2007 and 2009 where they won the Regional Championship gold medal(s) in the Southeast Region of the Ottawa Carleton Elementary Athletic Association every year.. Marial Shayok from the school currently plays in the NBA for the Philadelphia 76ers. == References == Sources *Hawthorne Public School *http://esip.edu.gov.on.ca/english/profiles/school_info.asp?ID=B66184&schoolid;=250848 *http://www.ocdsb.ca/PDF%20files/profiles/2008_2009/HAWT.pdf Category:Elementary schools in Ottawa Category:Educational institutions established in 1899 Category:1899 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Hawthorne Public School (Ottawa)"},{"id":"5564011","text":"Fox Island(s) may refer to: ==Canada== * Fox Island, Hermitage Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, a settlement * Fox Island, South Coast, Newfoundland and Labrador, a settlement * Fox Island, Lake Kipawa, Quebec, uninhabited, located on the north end of Lake Kipawa near Kipawa, Quebec * Fox Island, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Quebec, uninhabited, located South of Harrington Harbour, Quebec in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence * Fox Islands (British Columbia), in that province's Central Coast region * Fox Island Main, Nova Scotia * Fox Island, New Brunswick * Fox Island, Ontario is a small island in Lake Simcoe forms the reserve of the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation ==Falkland Islands== * Fox Island, Falkland Islands ==United States== *Fox Islands (Alaska) in the Aleutians *Fox Island (Alaska) near Seward in Resurrection Bay *The islands of North Haven and Vinalhaven in Penobscot Bay, Maine *Fox Island (Massachusetts) in the Charles River *Fox Islands (Michigan) in northern Lake Michigan *Fox Island (Detroit River), another island in southeastern Michigan *Fox Island (Thousand Islands) in Lake Ontario (Thousand Islands) *Fox Island (Rhode Island) in Narragansett Bay *Fox Island, Washington ","title":"Fox Islands"},{"id":"5564015","text":"A tumpong, a Philippine bamboo flute of the Maguindanaon people The tumpong (also inci among the Maranao) is a type of Philippine bamboo flute used by the Maguindanaon, half the size of the largest bamboo flute, the palendag.

The tower was built from 1999 to 2002 to accommodate Swiss investment bank UBS AG's Chicago headquarters. Originally UBS Tower, as it was solely known then, housed four different branches of the bank including its investment banking, wealth management advisory, asset management, and private banking businesses. It was designed by Lohan Associates (now Goettsch Partners) and developed by John Buck Company. ==Building== The UBS Tower was the first large multi-tenant tower to be constructed in Chicago for 6 years since 1993. Architecture The tower's most eye-catching feature is its main lobby. The lobby's glass wall was a first in the United States. The wall was made out of 5' x 5' glass panes attached to a system of medallions and cable. This cable system was tested at pressures above 150 psf, or a wind speed of nearly 250 mph. The glass itself is also noteworthy- an optical interference anti-reflective glass (designed by Schott AG) with an unusually low surface reflectivity of 1% is used. This imbues the lobby with an almost transparent appearance. Exterior landscaping was designed by the Berkeley, Calif.-based firm, Peter Walker and Partners Landscape Architecture Inc. Enclos, a facade engineering and curtain wall design company, designed and installed the first ever cable net glass wall in the United States at the lobby area of One North Wacker in downtown Chicago. The cable net strategy developed effectively minimized the sightlines of the steel support structure supporting the glass, allowing architect Goettsch Partners to achieve maximum transparency with a series of 15 meter glass facades that wrap the perimeter of the lobby space in over 1,500 square meters of glass.One North Wacker Glass Facade at Enclos Artwork Artwork throughout the building is drawn from the UBS PaineWebber Collection of contemporary art pieces and from the UBS Global Asset Management collection of architectural relics. Roy Lichtenstein‚Äôs sculpture, Archaic Head, is displayed on the 38th floor near Louis Sullivan‚Äôs elevator gate, claimed from the old Chicago Stock Exchange. Use With of floorspace, UBS Tower's rents are among the highest per square foot of any building in the Chicago Metropolitan Area at an average of over $25 per square foot on a triple net basis, grossing up to over $40 per square foot. The building amenities also include a two story underground garage for senior executives, One North Kitchen and Bar, a Conference Center, Fitness Center and Convenience Store. The building also has a cafeteria on the 30th floor, which serves a range of traditional and contemporary American cuisine as well as other cuisine featured from around the world on a rotating basis. ==Awards== In March 2002, the building was recognized as ‚ÄúDevelopment of the Year‚Äù at the 14th Annual Greater Chicago Commercial Real Estate Awards. == Major Tenants == North Wacker Drive. *UBS AG *Barnes & Thornburg LLP *L.E.K.

He last served as a head coach for Fenerbah√ße of the Turkish Super League and the EuroLeague. Obradoviƒá has won 63 club titles and honours in his entire coaching career, including nine EuroLeague titles with five different clubs, and has also made 18 EuroLeague Final Four appearances, during his coaching career. In addition to his success at the club level, he has also won major trophies as the head coach of the senior FR Yugoslavian national team, most notably winning the gold medals at the 1997 EuroBasket and the 1998 FIBA World Championship. Among his individual coaching awards, he has won three EuroLeague Coach of the Year and four Greek Basket League Best Coach awards. In 2008, he was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors, as a head coach. ==Early life== Obradoviƒá was born March 9, 1960, in ƒåaƒçak, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. ==Playing career== Borac ƒåaƒçak (1978‚Äì1984) Obradoviƒá started his club career as a basketball player with Borac ƒåaƒçak, in their youth system. During the 1977‚Äì78 season, then eighteen-year-old Obradoviƒá, got his first taste of senior men's team basketball at Borac, as he appeared in 6 Yugoslav First Federal League games during the season, and contributed a total of 3 points. After eventually establishing himself as the team's starting point guard, he stayed with the club until 1984. Partizan Belgrade (1984‚Äì1991) Over the summer of 1984, the at the time twenty-four-year-old Obradoviƒá, joined Partizan Belgrade. He was brought in by Partizan's incoming head coach at that time Moka Slavniƒá, and the club's vice president at the time Dragan Kiƒáanoviƒá, both of which were recent retirees from their playing careers, and who had previously starred on the senior Yugoslav national team, throughout the 1970s, as a legendary point guard and shooting guard duo. In Obradoviƒá's third season with the team, Partizan won the 1986‚Äì87 season title of the Yugoslav League. In the following season, they reached the 1987‚Äì88 season edition of the European Champions Cup's Final Four. Finally, they won the 1989 Yugoslavian Cup and the Koraƒá Cup's championship of the 1988‚Äì89 season. During his time at Partizan, Obradoviƒá established himself as one of the best and most reliable point guards in Yugoslavia's top-level league. National team career Obradoviƒá was a member of the junior national teams of Yugoslavia. With Yugoslavia's under-19 national team, he played at the 1979 FIBA Under-19 World Championship. He was also a member of the senior Yugoslavian national team. With Yugoslavia's senior national team, he won a silver medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and a gold medal at the 1990 FIBA World Championship. End of playing career Obradoviƒá's playing career came to a halt, when he was sentenced to two years in prison, due to causing the death of a pedestrian, in a car accident. After serving his prison sentence, Obradoviƒá returned to the court as a player, and already in his latter days as a player, he began coaching Partizan Belgrade's youth team. He retired from playing basketball in 1991, and he then immediately signed on as the head coach of the senior team of the club. ==Coaching career== Obradoviƒá's greatness as a professional club basketball coach, is fully confirmed by the great collection of titles he has acquired in his twenty-eight-year career as a head coach, including: a record 9 European-wide premiere level EuroLeague championships (won with five different teams), a record 14 EuroLeague Finals appearances, a record 18 EuroLeague Final Four appearances, two European-wide secondary level Saporta Cup championships, and numerous national domestic league championships and national cups. Partizan Belgrade (1991‚Äì1993) Obradoviƒá's coaching career began quite suddenly in the summer of 1991 while he was still an active thirty-one-year-old Partizan Belgrade player getting ready for EuroBasket 1991 with the Yugoslav national team. Selected and coached by Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá, the 1991 national squad was to be captained by Obradoviƒá ‚Äî the oldest player among the assembled group. However, after finishing the training camp in Poreƒç and coming back to Belgrade to sleep over before leaving in the morning for a preparation friendly tournament in Germany, Obradoviƒá got called in for a meeting with the Partizan management ‚Äî club president Radojica Nikƒçeviƒá, vice- president Dragan Kiƒáanoviƒá, as well as board members ƒêorƒëe \\"Siske\\" ƒåoloviƒá, Milorad \\"Miketa\\" ƒêuriƒá, and Dragan Todoriƒá ‚Äî who convinced him to take over the Partizan head coaching job, which entailed retiring from playing effective immediately thus giving up a chance to captain the national team at the upcoming EuroBasket. The idea was to have Obradoviƒá, a debutante head coach, work under the guidance of experienced elder statesman of Yugoslav basketball, sixty-seven-year-old professor Aca Nikoliƒá, whose coaching advisory services were soon secured by Kiƒáanoviƒá and the club management. Also joining the front office in the technical director capacity was another fresh retiree from playing, thirty-one-year-old Milenko Savoviƒá, Obradoviƒá's longtime teammate at Partizan, who had spent the previous 1990‚Äì91 season playing for Vojvodina. In the 1991‚Äì92 season, Partizan had a 20‚Äì2 record in the 1991‚Äì92 YUBA League regular season. In the playoffs, they progressed to the final, winning the best-of-five series 3‚Äì0 against Crvena zvezda. It also won the Yugoslav Basketball Cup in 1992, beating Bosna 105‚Äì70 in the final game. In European competition, Obradoviƒá led the young squad to become the champions of 1991‚Äì92 FIBA European League, on the spur of breakup of Yugoslavia. Partizan played its international matches in Fuenlabrada, Spain, due to international sanctions imposed on FR Yugoslavia. In 1992‚Äì93 season, Partizan was runner-up to Crvena zvezda with 3‚Äì2 record in the final series. In 1993 Yugoslav Basketball Cup, it lost with 104‚Äì91 in the final game to OKK Beograd. Joventut (1993‚Äì1994) In 1993, Obradoviƒá signed a contract with the Spanish team Joventut, based in Badalona, where Partizan played its international matches in 1991‚Äì92 season. With Joventut, he won the 1993‚Äì94 FIBA European League. In Liga ACB, Joventut finished in 3rd place with 24‚Äì14 record. In 1994 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto, Joventut was eliminated in the quarterfinals. Real Madrid (1994‚Äì1997) After the end of season, Obradoviƒá signed a contract with Real Madrid. In his first season with the club, Real Madrid failed to defend the Liga ACB title, finishing in 3rd place with 27‚Äì19 record. In 1995 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto, Real Madrid finished in 4th place. However, he won the 1994‚Äì95 FIBA European League. In 1995‚Äì96 season, Real Madrid didn't manage to take any title. In Liga ACB, Real Madrid finished in 5th place with 28‚Äì12 record. In 1996 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto, Real Madrid finished in 3rd place. On the European scene, Obradoviƒá made his third consecutive Final Four appearance and second with Real Madrid, but ended losing in 3rd place game. In 1996‚Äì97 season, Real Madrid finished as the runner-up in theLiga ACB and was also eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 1997 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto. In European competitions, Real Madrid participated in second-tier FIBA Saporta Cup and eventually won it with 78‚Äì64 in the final game over Verona. At the end of the season, Obradoviƒá parted ways with the team. Benetton Treviso (1997‚Äì1999) In the summer of 1997, Obradoviƒá signed a contract with the Italian team Benneton Treviso. In 1997‚Äì98 season, Treviso was eliminated in the quarterfinal series of the Serie A1 Playoffs with 3‚Äì2 record by Reggio Emilia. In 1997‚Äì98 FIBA EuroLeague, Treviso finished in 3rd place after 96‚Äì89 win over Partizan Belgrade in the Final Four. In 1998‚Äì99 season, Treviso finished as the runner-up in the Serie A1 Playoffs, after 3‚Äì0 record in the final series against Varese. Also, Treviso won the FIBA Saporta Cup, following 64‚Äì60 win in the final game over Valencia. Panathinaikos (1999‚Äì2012) In the summer of 1999, Obradoviƒá became the head coach of Panathinaikos. In his first season with the club, he won the 1999‚Äì2000 Greek Basket League with 3‚Äì0 record in the final series against P.A.O.K. Thessaloniki. In 2000 Greek Basketball Cup final, it lost with 59‚Äì57 by AEK Athens. Also, Panathinaikos won the 1999‚Äì2000 FIBA EuroLeague, after 73‚Äì67 win in the final game over Maccabi Tel Aviv. It was club's second EuroLeague championship in history. Obradoviƒá stayed with Panathinaikos until 2012, leading the team to become the top club in European club basketball during that time, while simultaneously maintaining the club at the top position in the Greek national championship. In total, Obradoviƒá won with Panathinaikos eleven Greek League championships, seven Greek Cups and five EuroLeague titles (2000, 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2011). In 2007, he achieved winning the highly coveted Triple Crown championship, for the second time as a head coach (the first was in 1992 with Partizan), and won the EuroLeague Coach of the Year award. Also in 2009, in Berlin, he completed this achievement as head coach for the third time. In 2011, he won his 8th EuroLeague trophy overall, and 5th with Panathinaikos. Despite winning the Greek Cup in the 2011‚Äì12 season, Panathinaikos finished 4th in the 2011‚Äì12 season of the EuroLeague, while Olympiacos was crowned the EuroLeague champion. Following this disappointment, Panathinaikos lost to Olympiacos, 3 games to 2, in a best-of-five Greek League Finals series. After that, in June 2012, Obradoviƒá announced that he was stepping down as the head coach of Panathinaikos, after 13 consecutive seasons.

Two important Adams chromatic valence spaces are CIELUV and Hunter Lab. Chromatic value/valence spaces are notable for incorporating the opponent process model, and the empirically-determined 2¬Ω factor in the red/green vs. blue/yellow chromaticity components (such as in CIELAB). ==Chromatic value== In 1942, Adams suggested chromatic value color spaces. Chromatic value, or chromance, refers to the intensity of the opponent process responses, and is derived from Adams' theory of color vision. A chromatic value space consists of three components: * V_Y, the Munsell-Sloan-Godlove value function: V_Y^2=1.4742Y-0.004743Y^2 * V_X-V_Y, the red-green chromaticity dimension, where V_X is the value function applied to (y_n/x_n)X instead of Y * V_Z-V_Y, the blue-yellow chromaticity dimension, where V_Z is the value function applied to (y_n/z_n)Z instead of Y A chromatic value diagram is a plot of V_X-V_Y (horizontal axis) against 0.4(V_Z-V_Y) (vertical axis). The 2¬Ω scale factor is intended to make radial distance from the white point correlate with the Munsell chroma along any one hue radius (i.e., to make the diagram perceptually uniform). For achromatic surfaces, (y_n/x_n)X=Y=(y_n/z_n)Z and hence V_X-V_Y=0, V_Z-V_Y=0. In other words, the white point is at the origin. Constant differences along the chroma dimension did not appear different by a corresponding amount, so Adams proposed a new class of spaces, which he termed chromatic valence. These spaces have \\"nearly equal radial distances for equal changes in Munsell chroma\\". ==Chromance== In chromaticity scales, lightness is factored out, leaving two dimensions. Two lights with the same spectral power distribution, but different luminance, will have identical chromaticity coordinates. The familiar CIE (x, y) chromaticity diagram is very perceptually non-uniform; small perceptual changes in chromaticity in greens, for example, translate into large distances, while larger perceptual differences in chromaticity in other colors are usually much smaller. Adams suggested a relatively simple uniform chromaticity scale in his 1942 paper: \\\\frac{y_n}{x_n}X-Y and \\\\frac{y_n}{z_n}Z-Y where x_n, y_n, z_n are the chromaticities of the reference white object (the n suggests normalized). (Adams had used smoked magnesium oxide under CIE Illuminant C but these would be considered obsolete today. This exposition is generalized from his papers.) Objects which have the same chromaticity coordinates as the white object usually appear neutral, or fairly so, and normalizing in this fashion ensures that their coordinates lie at the origin. Adams plotted the first one the horizontal axis and the latter, multiplied by 0.4, on the vertical axis. The scaling factor is to ensure that the contours of constant chroma (saturation) lie on a circle. Distances along any radius from the origin are proportional to colorimetric purity. The chromance diagram is not invariant to brightness, so Adams normalized each term by the Y tristimulus value: : \\\\frac{y_n}{x_n}\\\\frac{X}{Y}=\\\\frac{x/x_n}{y/y_n} and \\\\frac{y_n}{z_n}\\\\frac{Z}{Y}=\\\\frac{z/z_n}{y/y_n} These expressions, he noted, depended only on the chromaticity of the sample. Accordingly, he called their plot a \\"constant-brightness chromaticity diagram\\". This diagram does not have the white point at the origin, but at (1,1) instead. == Chromatic valence == Chromatic valence spaces incorporate two relatively perceptually uniform elements: a chromaticity scale, and a lightness scale. The lightness scale, determined using the Newhall-Nickerson-Judd value function, forms one axis of the color space: : Y=1.2219V_J-0.23111V_J^2+0.23951V_J^3-0.021009V_J^4+0.0008404V_J^5 The remaining two axes are formed by multiplying the two uniform chromaticity coordinates by the lightness, VJ: : \\\\frac{X/x_n}{Y/y_n}-1=\\\\frac{X/x_n-Y/y_n}{Y/y_n} : \\\\frac{Z/z_n}{Y/y_n}-1=\\\\frac{Z/z_n-Y/y_n}{Y/y_n} This is essentially what Hunter used in his Lab color space. As with chromatic value, these functions are plotted with a scale factor of 2‚Öõ to give nearly equal radial distance for equal changes in Munsell chroma. ==Color difference== Adams' color spaces rely on the Munsell value for lightness. Defining chromatic valence components W_X=\\\\left(\\\\frac{x/x_n}{y/y_n}-1\\\\right) V_J and W_Z= \\\\left(\\\\frac{z/z_n}{y/y_n}-1\\\\right)V_J, we can determine the difference between two colors as: : \\\\Delta E=\\\\sqrt{(0.5 \\\\Delta V_J)^2+(\\\\Delta W_X)^2 + (0.4 \\\\Delta W_Z)^2} where VJ is the Newhall-Nickerson-Judd value function and the 0.4 factor is incorporated to better make differences in WX and WZ perceptually correspond to one another. In chromatic value color spaces, the chromaticity components are W_X=V_X-V_Y and W_Z=V_Z-V_Y. The difference is: : \\\\Delta E=\\\\sqrt{(0.23 \\\\Delta V_Y)^2+(\\\\Delta W_X)^2 + (0.4 \\\\Delta W_Z)^2} where the Munsell-Sloan-Godlove value function is applied to the tristimulus value indicated in the subscript. (Note that the two spaces use different lightness approximations.) ==References== Category:Color space ","title":"Adams chromatic valence color space"},{"id":"5564167","text":"van Rossem is a surname.

The Super Rare chase pieces in the set are previews of the Jade Rebellion faction, with the ships Black Lotus and Tiger's Breath, as well as Zheng Li Kwan, a 3-point treasure switcher and Jade Rebellion captain. Participation prizes from WizKids for Approved Play tournaments included 18 Limited Edition crew members, printed on glossy cardstock instead of the more usual styrene plastic. Similar to Revolution, in mid-2006 Wizkids began releasing this expansion in an Unlimited Edition version. The ships, crew, etc. in this version remained the same as the first edition, but with ship numbers preceded by the letters \\"UL\\". ==Criticism== Pirates of the Barbary Coast was criticized by many fans of the game as the ships and crew were heavily downgraded from Pirates of the Revolution, often seen as setting the bar prematurely high. Also, the Barbary Corsairs took the place of the Pirates, who are totally absent in this set, aside from a few cardboard special edition crew. ==Notable Ships== *L'Ange de la Mer - French, 4-mast, 13 points. This ship can be a formidable gunship if you take advantage of the special ability (+1 to cannon rolls if a captain is aboard). The Captain would improve the cannons to a respectable 2S 2L 2L 2S. The cargo hold is a decently sized 4 but with a captain aboard, she starts to scream for battle. Since treasure hauling doesn't suit L'Ange de la Mer, add a helmsman and a cannoneer and she can either escort the fastest treasure haulers or even engage the enemy gunship. *Intrepid - American, 4-mast, 15 points. This ship is another that can serve well as a gunship. Due to her special ability (+1 to cannon rolls if a captain is aboard), adding the requisite captain improves her cannons to 1L 2L 2L 1L. Her speed is average at S+S so a helmsman would be useful as well. The Intrepid leans more towards gunship than treasure hauler and would make a good ship for an extra action crew. *Nubian Prince - Barbary Corsair, 4-mast, 15 points. Although only of average speed (S+S) with weak cannons (2L 3S 4S 5L), the Nubian Prince is still well protected since she cannot be shot at by ships within S of her. Although not invincible, it certainly can create a maneuvering nightmare for your opponent and all the while you are busy gathering the gold with your other ships. She can't be ignored but she's difficult to hit. A major problem with this ship is that it can't pin-a major tactic among ships that cannot be shot at by ships within S. *Tiger's Eye - Barbary Corsair, 3-mast, 12 points. Already fast at S+S+S, the Tiger's Eye is a treasure runner candidate with her 5 cargo. With a helmsman and explorer, she'll be out and back in a flash. Her special ability to not be attacked by L range guns offers some protection from preying gunships but her speed keeps her the safest. ==Notable Crew== *English - Commodore Rhys Gryffyn Owen (0LR reroll 1 die per turn); Countess Diana Doone (0LR reroll 1 die per turn); Lawrence (The only English Canceler) *Spanish - Duque Marcus Vaccaro (0LR reroll 1 die per turn) *American - Wayne Nolan (0LR reroll 1 die per turn) *Barbary Corsairs - Aruj Barbarossa (10 points, may capture enemy crew for gold when boarding) Barbary Coast ","title":"Pirates of the Barbary Coast"},{"id":"5564210","text":"Fork Township, one of twelve townships in Wayne County, North Carolina, contains a population of 9,805 people as of the year 2000. == Geography == According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total land area of (46.4 sq mi) or approximately . == Demographics == As of the 2000 census, there were 9,805 people living in the township.

It operated a fleet of BAe 146's and Shorts 360's between 1987 and 1990. ==History== Capital Airlines, the self-styled \\"Yorkshire International Airline\\", operated between 1987 and 1990. It was the first airline to be based at Leeds Bradford Airport. The airline came into being in 1984 as Brown Air, a subsidiary of the Brown Group which specialised in the sales and maintenance of heavy plant equipment. It flew a Cessna 441 Conquest (G-MOXY) on services from Leeds Bradford to Oslo, originally flown as a corporate shuttle but then opened up for public bookings. An afternoon service from Leeds Bradford to Frankfurt was later introduced. The Conquest was then replaced with a Grumman Gulfstream 1 turboprop, registration G-BRWN. Scheduled services to Glasgow were introduced with a Short 330 aircraft after the previous operator, Metropolitan Airways, had ceased trading. The SH330 was later returned to its leasing company and the scheduled routes to Oslo and Frankfurt were discontinued. The sole Gulfstream 1 was then operated on a regular Leeds-Glasgow-Leeds-Cardiff service, introducing the first direct services from Leeds to Cardiff and a through-flight from Glasgow to Cardiff. The Gulfstream 1 proved a popular aircraft and operated 50 sectors a week for a full year with a 100% dispatch record. The aircraft soon became too small to service demand and it was then the airline re-branded as Capital Airlines and took delivery of its first Short 360-300 G-BNDM, which was the first airline to operate the Short 360 configured with 39 seats. Its route network was expanded progressively to include routes from Leeds Bradford to Belfast City and Dublin, a new Leeds- Edinburgh-Leeds-Southampton operation and services from Leeds Bradford to the Channel Islands, London Gatwick and Brussels. Services between London Luton and Belfast City were also introduced at that time. In 1988 the airline was one of the first to adopt a low cost pricing model with seats priced at ¬£13/¬£26/¬£39 (lowest price for early booking) between LTN & BHD, undercutting BA cheapest price of ¬£45 between London & Belfast. From 1988, the fleet of leased Short 360 aircraft,See entries on https://siteapps.caa.co.uk/g-info/ for G-OLTN, G-OLGW, G-OLBA, G-BNDM, G-CPTL and G-OEEC were expanded as routes were commenced. An extensive range of charter flights from the Channel Islands were offered, together with scheduled services from Cardiff to Jersey and Guernsey as well as Royal Mail flights from Belfast Aldergrove to East Midlands. A short-lived attempt to operate Dublin-Belfast City scheduled services also took place towards the end of Capital's existence. Capital took over the long-established maintenance and light aircraft operations of Northair at Leeds Bradford, providing access to hangar facilities, office space and the establishment of its own reservations centre and catering service at the airport. With a Short 360 fleet of six leased aircraft the airline embarked upon the expansion to service the demand on its Belfast-Luton and Dublin-Luton services which were running at near full capacity and in 1989 leased two British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jet aircraft, formerly operated by Air Wisconsin of the USA. These were used to expand its services from London Luton with the upgrade of the Belfast City service from the 39-seat Short 360 to the 106-seat jet; a service linking Leeds Bradford with Luton each day was effectively a positioning flight to return the 146 to the Leeds Bradford base and rotate the two BAe 146 aircraft to Leeds Bradford every other day. The BAe 146 aircraft also flew weekend charters from Leeds Bradford and Manchester for Intasun to destinations including in the summer season Malaga and Palma and Salzburg in the winter season. The airline abruptly ceased operations in June 1990 as a result of Brown Group International, its parent company, declaring itself bankrupt due to their bankers in Norway withdrawing their financing of the group activities and the calling of the groups borrowing \\"cross guarantees\\" by the bank to repay the outstanding loans. The two leased BAe 146s were repossessed by British Aerospace and re-registered to them on 9 August 1990,See entries on https://siteapps.caa.co.uk/g-info/ for G-OSKI and G-OSUN while the leased Short 360s were repossessed by Shorts. These are the route/frequencies at the time of its demise (June 1990): * BHD-DUB 3 x daily (SH6) * BHD-LBA 5 x daily (4 x SH6, 1 x 146) * BHD-LTN 3 x daily (146) * LBA- BRS-CWL-LBA-GLA 2 x daily (LBA-GLA 3 x daily) (SH6) * CWL-JER Wed/Sat/Sun (SH6/146) * DUB-LBA 3 x daily (with extra flight on Mon and Fri) (SH6, 146 on Sun) * DUB-LTN 4 x daily (146) * EDI-LBA-SOU 2 x daily (EDI-LBA 3 x daily) (SH6) * GCI-LBA Wed/Sat/Sun (SH6/146) * JER-LBA Wed/Sat/Sun (SH6/146) * LBA- LGW 3 x daily (SH6) * LBA-LTN 1 x daily (146, SH6 on Sat) At the conclusion of the bankruptcy the Capital Airlines subsidiary of the Brown Group was \\"technically\\" solvent being GBP 4,000,000 \\"in the black\\" if Brown Group had been able to repay the GBP 12,000,000 it owed to the airline. This was not possible as Brown Group had debts in excess of GBP 20,000,000. A number of companies looked to acquire Capital but ultimately decided not to go ahead. The primary Capital routes were later taken up by Jersey European (Leeds- Belfast City and Leeds-Jersey from 1991); Loganair (Leeds-Glasgow from July 1990) and later Yorkshire European (Leeds-Southampton). Its two 146 and six Shorts 360-300 aircraft went on to operate for other airlines. The assets of Capital and the Northair subsidiary were acquired by Lambson Aviation for around GBP 700,000. ==Livery== The body had a white top-half and a red underside. Where the colours met, they merged with pin-stripe horizontal stripes increasing/decreasing in thickness. The tail was white with large black 'Capital' lettering running down the leading edge.

He was a close relative, probably a nephew, of Sir Roger Manwood, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in the reign of Elizabeth. ==Writings== Manwood's first essay on forest law entitled A Brefe Collection of the Lawes of the Forrest was circulated privately in 1592. It was revised, enlarged, and published by Thomas Wight and Bonham Norton in 1598 as A Treatise and Discourse of the Lawes of the Forrest.Online version of Chapter 1. This underwent numerous subsequent editions, most notably in that of 1615 by the Societie of Stationers, a version which included material from the Brefe Collection which was not included in the 1598 version. Manwood's book remained a standard reference on forest law through the mid-1900s. His Treatise has become perhaps the most-cited secondary source of forest law.The primary sources are e.g. Canute's civil dooms (c. 1025) and the Charter of the Forest (1217). As such it is quoted approvingly by Sir William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England. However, although Manwood's work is considered by Blackstone to be authoritative, others have pointed out that Manwood, being himself a royal officer, had an interest in amplifying the institutions he described. It has also been pointed out that these institutions had in his time largely fallen into desuetude, and his descriptions may be partly artificial and fanciful.About Manwood and His Forest Treatise by Joshua Calhoun.

Ingwenyama Mbandzeni was the son of Mswati II and Nandzi Nkambule. His mother the wife of King Mswati had died when he was still very young. Mbandzeni ascended to the throne after his half brother Ludvonga II died before he could become the king. Ludvonga's death resulted in his mother Inkhosikati Lamgangeni adopting Mbandzeni who was motherless as her son, thus making him King and her the Queen mother of Swaziland. His royal capital was at Mbekelweni. During his kingship Mbandzeni, granted many mining, farming, trading and administrative concessions to white settlers from Britain and the Transvaal. These concessions granted with the help of Offy Sherpstone eventually led to the conventions of 1884 and 1894, which reduced the overall borders of Swaziland and later made Swaziland a protectorate of the South African Republic. During a period of concessions preceded by famine around 1877 some of the tindvunas (governors) from within Swaziland like Mshiza Maseko and Ntengu kaGama Mbokane were given permission by King Mbandzeni to relocate to farms towards the Komati River, Mshiza Maseko later settled in a place called eLuvalweni, where he was later buried. Mbandzeni, still in command of a large Swazi army of more than 15000 men aided the British in defeating Sekhukhune in 1879 and preventing Zulu incursion into the Transvaal during the same year. As a result, he guaranteed his country's independence and international recognition despite the Scramble for Africa which was taking place at the time. Mbandzeni died after an illness in 1889 and is quoted to have said in his deathbed \\"the Swazi kingship dies with me\\". He was buried at the royal cemetery at Mbilaneni alongside his father and grandfather Sobhuza I. Mbandzeni was succeeded by his young son Mahlokohla and his wife Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli after a 5 year regency of Queen Tibati Nkambule. Today a number of buildings and roads in Swaziland are named after Mbandzeni. Among these the Mbandzeni house in Mbabane and the Mbandzeni Highway to Siteki are named after him. ==Early life== After the death of King Mswati II in July 1868, the Queen Mother Tsandzile Ndwandwe served as the Queen Regent. The son of Mswati II and inkhosikati LaKhumalo was chosen to become the king and was named Ludvonga II. However he died of poisoning in 1874 just before he could become the King. As a result the Swazi council of elders recommended that LaKhumalo choose another child to be \\"put in her stomach\\" and become her son. She chose Mbandzeni who was at the time motherless as his mother had died while he was very young. Mbandzeni thus became the king in 1875 though not without further drama. Another pretender to the throne, Prince Mbilini waMswati, who was allied with the Zulu Kings, first Mpande ka Senzangakhona and later Cetshwayo ka Mpande. However Mbilini never succeeded in his goal to become the King of Swaziland. ==Kingship== Mbandzeni's rule consists of a number of notable events. The first event was the continued interaction of Swazis and the Transvaal Boers. During the rule of Mswati, such a relationship had been established with Mswati granting some land sales to the Ohristad and Lydenburg Boers in the 1850s. During the reign of Mbandzeni, numerous visits to his capital in Mbekelweni was made by many concessionaires and settlers who were seeking land, mining rights and other business deals. Mbandzeni granted many leases to the settlers and with the advice of 'Offy' Shepstone the nephew of Sir Theophilus Shepstone who was the administrator of the Natal colony, even more. Mbandzeni and royal officials granted many overlapping concessions to the British and Dutch interests and in return were paid in either gold or cattle or other available currency or goods. It is as a result of these that Swaziland came to be of major interest to British settlers and burghers from the Dutch republics for its potential in agriculture, mining and in general settlement. The discovery of gold in the Transvaal exacerbated the issue. Immediately into the reign of Mbandzeni, skirmishes between the British and the Boers had begun and Britain annexed the Transvaal and made it its colony. The Zulu Kingdom in the South under Cetshwayo was still independent with British recognition, but would soon be at war with Britain. The Zulu war occurred in 1879 and the renegade Swazi Prince Mbilini who was married to the granddaughter of Chief Manzini Mbokane a trusted confidant of King Mbandzeni was allied with the Zulu King Cetshwayo during this period. Chief Mbokane through his son Ntengu Mbokane, who was the father of Prince Mbilini's wife intervened and ensured that Prince Mbilini's cooperation with King Cetshwayo was stopped. Despite that King Cetshwayo would often raid the southern chiefdoms of Swaziland. As a result, Mbandzeni would not accept the request of Cetshwayo to assist in the war against the British. Indeed Swazi troops helped to prevent Zulu raids into the Transvaal. During the same year, the British forces under Sir Garnet Wolseley in the Transvaal, sought Swazi help to defeat the Pedi King Sekhukhune who had resisted the Boers a few years earlier in 1876. The Pedi, having harbored another Prince who was a pretender to the Swazi throne eventually faced a British attack backed by a 10000 strong Swazi force which led to the capture of Sekhukhune and the destruction of that kingdom. Mbandzeni's support for Britain was rewarded with Britain's recognition for Swaziland's independence and a promise to protect Swazis against Zulu and Boer encroachment. However the concessions Mbandzeni and Mswati earlier had granted to the settlers would be detrimental to the independence issue as they were used in the Swaziland conventions in 1884 and in 1894 with Britain reneging on its promises. The present border of Swaziland was decided upon in these two conventions, with Shepstone representing Swazi interests in the 1884 and Allister Miller in 1894. In both negotiations, no direct Swazi representation was present. The border with the Portuguese territorial boundary was decided to be the Lubombo ranges for Swaziland and the MacMahon line for British Tongaland (in South Africa). The border with the South African Republic was chosen to be the present boundary, cutting off many Swazi homes including royal villages such as Mjindini, Mekemeke, among others. As a result many Swazis remain residents of South Africa especially in Mpumalanga province, a number bigger than the population of Swaziland proper. ==Later life== Mbandzeni died after ill health during the border discussions with very little input from him. He was buried at the royal burial site at Mbilaneni where Mswati II and Sobhuza I had been buried. Mbandzeni like other Swazi kings before him had many wives, and children. His wife Labotsibeni Mdluli was chosen to be the Queen Mother and her son Mahlokohla was chosen to be the King of Swaziland. A regency period of about 5 years followed with Queen Regent Tibati Nkambule ruling and then the young Ngwane V taking over. It was during this time that Swaziland was made a protectorate of the South African Republic although a complete administration never took place. ==Legacy== Mbandzeni's rule is viewed differently by many people. Some view him as someone who sold his country. In some publications it is even said that Mbandzeni \\"sold the land but kept his country\\". Some viewed him as a kind hearted person who did not know when to stop. However some consider him as a ruler who did what he could at a difficult time. ==External linksReferences== Category:1855 births Category:1889 deaths Category:19th-century monarchs in Africa Category:Swazi monarchs ","title":"Mbandzeni"},{"id":"5564225","text":"Vivian S√∏rmeland (born July 8, 1985 in Osen), came 3rd in season 4 of Idol (Norway) in May 2006.

The father and son duo believe Shell violated intellectual property agreements and filed several lawsuits against Shell prior to starting several websites critical of Shell, including royaldutchshellplc.com. The site has been oft quoted in news sources and is known for its activities as an Internet leak and forum for Shell whistleblowers. ==Website background== The Donovans owned a chain of petrol stations in east London and Essex, for which they created many sales promotion campaigns under their company Don Marketing. In 1981, Don Marketing devised a promotional game scheme for Royal Dutch Shell called \\"Make Money\\". Because the promotion was successful, Don created several other promotional campaigns for Shell, which led in part to Shell being identified as \\"perhaps the biggest user of games\\" in 1986. In 1992 Shell appointed a new National Promotions manager to whom Don's promotional ideas were disclosed on a confidential basis. In 1994, Don Marketing issued a writ against Shell with respect to a follow-up \\"Make Money\\" promotion claiming breach of confidence and breach of contract, which ended in a ¬£60,000 settlement. A second writ was issued concerning a Nintendo promotion that ran in 1993. Shell settled both claims in October 1996. A third lawsuit was processed in 1999; however, the claimant abandoned the claim. During the course of the litigation, the Donovans founded the \\"Shell Corporate Conscience Pressure Group\\" and accompanying gripe site, which Shell UK Media Relations responded to internally in March 1995. After Don Marketing was dissolved, father and son Alfred and John Donovan created several websites to expose their perceived injustices while working with Shell, one of which is royaldutchshellplc.com. They also operate Shellnews.net. While Royal Dutch Shell plc is a trademarked name of the company, the domain name was first registered by Alfred Donovan. It avoids being an illegal cybersquatter as long as it is non-commercial, active, and no attempt is made to sell the domain name, as determined by WIPO proceedings In 2005 Donovan said he would relinquish the site to Shell after it \\"gets rid of all the management he deems responsible for its various recent woes.\\" ==Reaction to site== Internet leak The site has been recognized by several media outlets for its role as an Internet leak. In 2008 the Financial Times published an article based on a letter published by royaldutchshellplc.com, which Reuters and The Times also covered shortly thereafter. The site has also been cited several other times by the aforementioned news sources as well as others. On October 18, 2006, the site published an article stating that Shell had for some time been supplying information to the Russian government relating to Sakhalin II. The Russian energy company Gazprom subsequently obtained a 50% stake in the Sakhalin-II project. Other instances where the site has acted as an Internet leak include a 2007 IT outsourcing plan, as well as a 2008 internal memo where CEO Jeroen van der Veer expressed disappointment in the company's share-price performance. Recognition The gripe site has been recognized as a source of information regarding Shell by several news sources. In the 2006 Fortune Global 500 rankings, in which Royal Dutch Shell placed third, royaldutchshellplc.com was listed alongside shell.com as a source of information. In 2007 the site was described as \\"a hub for activists and disgruntled former employees.\\" A 2009 article called royaldutchshellplc.com \\"the world's most effective adversarial Web site.\\" The site has been described as \\"an open wound for Shell.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * royaldutchshellplc.com * Don Marketing Category:British satirical websites Category:Corporate scandals Category:Intellectual property activism Category:Royal Dutch Shell controversies Category:United States trademark law ","title":"Royaldutchshellplc.com"},{"id":"5564271","text":"Type 38 may refer to the following Japanese weapons: *Type 38 rifle *Type 38 cavalry rifle *Type 38 75 mm Field Gun *Type 38 10 cm Cannon *Type 38 15 cm howitzer ","title":"Type 38"},{"id":"5564280","text":"Joseph Nicholas Keohane (18 August 1918 - 5 January 1988) was an Irish Gaelic football manager, selector and former player. His league and championship career with the Kerry senior team spanned thirteen seasons from 1936 to 1948. Born in Tralee, County Kerry, Keohane played competitive Gaelic football in his youth. By his late teens he had established himself as a key member of the John Mitchels senior team. In a twenty-year club career Keohane won three county senior championship medals. Keohane made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he was selected on the Kerry minor team in 1936. He played one championship season with the minor team, and ended his tenure in this grade as an All-Ireland runner-up. He was still a member of the minor team when he made his senior debut during the 1936 championship. Over the course of the next thirteen seasons, Keohane won five All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 1937, three championships in-a-row from 1939 to 1941 and a final victory in 1946. He also won eleven Munster medals. Keohane played his last game for Kerry in August 1948. After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1938, Keohane was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for much of his inter-county career. During that time he won two Railway Cup medals. He joined the Irish Army but was court martialed and convicted for misappropriation of ammunition believed to be destined for the IRA. In retirement from playing Keohane became involved in team management and coaching. He served as manager, trainer and selector with the Kerry senior team at various times between 1969 and 1988 and helped guide Kerry through a period in which they won twenty three major honours. These include nine All-Ireland Championships, including a record-equalling four-in-a-row between 1978 and 1981 and a three-in-a-row between 1984 and 1986, eleven Munster Championships and three National Leagues, including two league-championship doubles. Keohane was posthumously named in the full-back position on the Football Team of the Millennium in 1999, and selected on a list of the 125 greatest Gaelic footballers of all time in a 2009 poll. In 1973, he stood as an Independent general election candidate in the Kerry North constituency, representing Aontacht √âireann. He obtained 695 votes coming last in the poll. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Gaelic football managers Category:Gaelic football selectors Category:John Mitchels (Kerry) Gaelic footballers Category:Kerry inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Munster inter-provincial Gaelic footballers Category:Winners of five All-Ireland medals (Gaelic football) ","title":"Joe Keohane"},{"id":"5564288","text":"Vladim√≠r Orsz√°gh (born May 24, 1977) is a retired Slovak professional ice hockey player. Now he is head coach of HC Slovan Bratislava and assistant coach of Craig Ramsay at the Slovak representation. ==Playing career== As a youth, Orsz√°gh played in the 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Poprad. Orsz√°gh was drafted into the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1995 by the New York Islanders in the fifth round (106th overall) and he has been playing in the NHL since 1997. From 1997 through to 2000, Vladim√≠r Orsz√°gh was attempting to crack the New York Islanders line-up, as he had a stint of 34 games in the NHL over those three years, tallying a total of five points (3 goals and 2 assists). After becoming an unrestricted free agent after the 1999‚Äì2000 NHL season, Orsz√°gh signed a contract with the Djurg√•rdens IF hockey team of the Swedish Elitserien, based in Stockholm. In Sweden, he had a breakthrough season, scoring 23 goals and marking 13 assists, for a combined total of 36 points. The scouts of the Nashville Predators of the NHL noticed Orsz√°gh's solid performance and signed him as a free agent the following season. In his time with the Predators, he has tallied 105 points (47 goals and 58 assists) and he has also helped them earn their first play-off spot in the team's six-year history. Throughout his six years of NHL experience, Orsz√°gh wore the number 33 jersey and has played both the left wing and the right wing positions. On December 30, 2005, Orsz√°gh joined the St. Louis Blues after he was claimed off of waivers. Orszagh missed the entire 2006‚Äì2007 season due to a knee injury. ==Career statistics== Regular season and playoffs { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

It is named after the 1969 Fassbinder film '. The band's music is characterized by its extensive use of both romantic and classical styled male and female vocals. Founded by Ralf Donis, Maik Hartung, Sven Mertens, and Susann Heinrich in 1990, the band members and music have changed slightly since then. The first few LICTD albums were released on the Hyperium record label in Europe and on the new Metropolis Records label in the United States. The band's album Teignmouth was the first Metropolis Records release, and remains one of LICTD's more popular albums. Following the departure of Donis, the more experimental songs that characterized some of the early LICTD work gave way to a much more classical sound. Eclipse, the latest LICTD album with new content, reached number one on Mexican New Age Sales Charts. At present, the band is based in Leipzig, Germany. The band performed at major international festivals including, Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2003 and 2005 and the annual Bach Festival Leipzig in 2003. == Discography ==  Full length albums and EPs  * Wild World Hyperium vinyl EP (1991) * Teignmouth Hyperium Records / Metropolis Records (1991) * Mental Traveller Hyperium / Metropolis Records (1992) * Oxeia Hyperium / Metropolis Records (1994) * Spellbound Hyperium CDS (1995) * Atopos Chrom (1999) * Eclipse In Deyagora Music (2003) * Tempest In Deyagora Music (2013)  Special releases  * Two Faces But No Guitars (1990) ‚Äî MC limited to 20 copies * Auter Hyperium (1995) ‚Äî collection CD * Inside the Bell (2004) ‚Äî live album limited * Time (2006) 2CD In Deyagora Music‚Äîcollection CD limited to 1,000 copies  Compilation appearances  * Romantic Sound Sampler III Zillo (1991) * Bouquet of Dreams Dark Star (1991) * From Hypnotic Hyperium (1992) * Hyperium Promotional Sampler Hyperium (1992) * Oxeia on Heavenly Voices Part 2 Hyperium (1993) * Borderline Messerschmitt (1993) * We Came to Dance Vol. 1 Sub Terranean (1993) * Art and Dance Vol. 4 Gothic Arts (1993) * The Fallen Angel Zoth Ommog (1994) * Affaire de Coeur (1994) * Heavenly Voices III Hyperium (1995) * Zauber of Music Vol. II Hyperium (1995) * Moonraker Vol. II Sub Terranean (1995) * Electrocity Vol. 6 Ausfahrt (1995) * German Mystic Sound Sampler Vol. V Zillo (1995) * Miroque Sub Terranean (1996) * Touched By The Hand Of Goth Vol. II Sub Terranean (1996) * The City In the Sea on Goth Box Disk 3 Cleopatra (1996) * Hyperium New Classics Vol. 1 Hyperium (1997) * Love and Solitude on The Black Bible 4CD Cleopatra (1998) * Wild World on Orkus Presents The Best Of The 90s 3 2CD Orkus (2003) == Band members ==  Studio and Live  * Ralf Donis (1990‚Äì1993) ‚Äî vocals * Maik Hartung (1990‚Äìpresent) ‚Äî strings/percussion/keyboards * Sven Mertens (1990‚Äì1993, 1997‚Äì2011) ‚Äî backing vocals/percussion/keys * Susann Porter / Heinrich (1990‚Äì1995, 2001‚Äì2011) ‚Äî vocals * Andrew Porter (1993‚Äì1995)- drums, vocals * Manuela Budich (1997‚Äì2000) ‚Äî vocals * Helen Landen (2000‚Äì2001) ‚Äî vocals (live) * Ralf Jehnert (1997‚Äìpresent) ‚Äî vocals * Anja Herrmann (2012‚Äì2013) ‚Äî Vocals/Percussion * Justus Kriewald (2010 - 2012) ‚Äî Keyboards/Backing Vocals/Bass * Uli Stornowski (2012‚Äì2013) ‚Äî Percussion/Flute/Backing Vocals  Live only  * Michael Metzler (2003‚ÄìPresent) ‚Äî also a member of Sarband * Neil Rupsch (2010-2011) ‚Äî Drums * Ren√© Bielig (2010-2011) ‚Äî Guitars/Bass == External links == * * Love Is Colder Than Death - MySpace Fan Page * * Category:Neoclassical dark wave musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:Metropolis Records artists ","title":"Love Is Colder Than Death (band)"},{"id":"5564310","text":"Jean-Christophe Rufin (born 28 June 1952) is a French doctor, diplomat, historian, globetrotter and novelist. He is the president of Action Against Hunger, one of the earliest members of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, and a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. ==Private and public life== Early life Rufin was born in Bourges, Cher in 1952. An only child, he was raised by his grandparents as his father had left the family and his mother worked in Paris. His grandfather, a doctor and member of the French Resistance during World War II had been imprisoned for two years at Buchenwald. In 1977, after medical school, Rufin went to Tunisia as a volunteer doctor. He led his first humanitarian mission in Eritrea, where he met Azeb, who became his second wife. Career Human rights activism A graduate of the Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Paris (Sciences-Po), in 1986 he became advisor to the Secretary of State for Human Rights and published his first book, Le Pi√®ge humanitaire (The Humanitarian Trap), an essay on the political stakes of humanitarian action. As a doctor, he is one of the pioneers of humanitarian movement \\"without borders,\\" for which he has led numerous missions in eastern Africa and Latin America. A former vice-president of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res and former president of the non-governmental organization Action Against Hunger. Report on racism and anti-Semitism In 2003, Rufin was commissioned by French Interior Minister Dominique de Villepin to write an in- depth report on the upsurge of anti-Semitism in France. He presented the final report Jean-Christophe Rufin: Chantier sur la lutte contre le racisme et l'antis√©mitisme. (\\"Report on the fight against racism and anti-Semitism\\") in French on October 19, 2004. The \\"Rufin report\\" (as it later became known), as described by the US State Department,\\"France: International Religious Freedom Report 2005\\", U.S. Department of State. concluded the following: * Racism and anti-Semitism were a threat to French democracy. * Anti-semitic acts are not only carried out by elements of the extreme right and youths of North African descent, but also by \\"disaffected individuals\\" whose anti-Semitic obsessions prompt their attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions. * Radical anti- Zionists who question Israel's right to exist were dangerous. The report, as described by the US State Department, recommended the following actions: * That a law be created to punish those publicly equating Israel with apartheid or Nazi Germany. * That the French press law of 1881, designed to guarantee freedom of the press, is too unwieldy to adequately address the issues of racism. * That intolerance be countered in primary schools and by the education of new immigrants about the fight against racism and anti-Semitism. * That an observation system to monitor racist and anti-Semitic websites be created and that it work closely with authorities to prosecute offenders. The report was criticised by Michel Tubiana of the Ligue des droits de l'homme, who accused Rufin of \\"acting like an arsonist fireman.\\" Tubiana said that the focus on anti-Semitism created an \\"imbalance\\" in the approach to fighting all racism, and that if the recommendation became law, the umbrella group of the International Federation for Human Rights would be punished because it viewed Israel's treatment of Israeli Arabs as \\"discriminatory\\". ==Selected bibliography== Essays * L'aventure humanitaire (\\"The Humanitarian Adventure\\"), coll. \\"D√©couvertes Gallimard\\" (n¬∫ 226) (1994) * La dictature lib√©rale (\\"The Liberal Dictatorship\\") (1994) * L'empire et les nouveaux barbares (\\"The Empire and the New Barbarians\\") (1991) * Le pi√®ge humanitaire : quand l'humanitaire remplace la guerre (\\"The Humane Trap: when humanitarianism replaces war\\") (1986) Novels *1997 The Abyssinian (1997) - winner of Prix Goncourt du Premier Roman and Prix M√©diterran√©e *1998 The Siege of Isfahan *1999 Lost Causes / \\"Asmara et les causes perdues\\" (1999) - winner of prix Interalli√© *2001 Brazil Red (Rouge Br√©sil; 2001) - winner of prix Goncourt *2004 Globalia *2007 Le Parfum d'Adam *2010 Katiba *2011 Sept histoires qui reviennent de loin *2012 Le Grand C≈ìur *2014 The Red Collar (Le Collier rouge) - winner of prix Maurice Genevoix *2015 Check-point *2016 The Santiago Pilgrimage Non-fiction books * √âconomie des guerres civiles (\\"Economics of Civil Wars\\"), with Jean Fran√ßois (1996) * Mondes rebelles (\\"World Rebels\\"), with Arnaud de La Grange and Jean-Marc Balancie.

Whitmore II and Joyce Renee Lewis, and directed by Neema Barnette. It features Da Brat, N'Bushe Wright, Mos Def, LisaRaye McCoy, and Monica Calhoun. The film is about a group of female inmates fighting back against their abusers and taking over Whitehead Correctional Institute, where they are incarcerated. It won four awards and received 1 nomination. ==Synopsis== Frances, the new inmate at Whitehead, befriends a circle of inmates, and together they rebel against the prison's abuse and exploitation. After several failed attempts to stop the harsh working conditions along with the rape and death of their friend Lil‚Äô Mama, Frances and the other inmates decide to take action and take control over the prison to stop the abuse and stand up for their rights. ==Plot== Sabrina Downs (Da Brat) narrates an experience that she had while serving time as a convict in the Whitehead Correctional Institute. Her story begins as she meets Frances Shephard (LisaRaye McCoy), a timid woman that is new to the prison system, during their bus ride to the correctional facility. The women arrive at the prison, where they meet Captain Alan Dease (Clifton Powell), who proceeds to line them up and exclaim the rules of the prison and consequences for not abiding by them. As Frances is escorted by an officer to the jail cell she will be living in, she enters to a scene of female convicts gambling, smoking, and talking amongst themselves. She attempts to move in with her cellmate Nikki Barnes (N'Bushe Wright), who is presumed to be the leader amongst the convicts, but is denied and instead lives with Lil‚Äô Mama (Lark Voorhies), a 17-year-old pregnant convict who is deeply involved in Christianity and befriends Frances. Lil‚Äô Mama introduces Frances to another inmate named Wet (Monica Calhoun), who informs her on the different crews in the prison. When asked what crime she committed, Frances confesses that she accidentally murdered her abusive husband in an effort to protect herself. The next day, Frances is familiarized with the inmates‚Äô daily routine of hard labor in what the other convicts refer to as a ‚Äúsweatshop.‚Äù Michael Meadows (Mos Def), a law student who is hired as the new correctional officer at Whitehead, enters Dease's office and introduces himself. They have a brief conversation before Dease is called to stop a fight that has occurred between Nikki and Aisha (Tichina Arnold), who the other inmates claim to be Dease's secret mistress and informer. After two officers take Aisha away for starting the fight, Dease has an intimidating conversation with Michael, informing him that he runs the prison, not Nelson (Reed R. McCants), the warden. Nelson approaches Dease and they collaborate about their plans to increase their profit off the prison. Aisha enters Dease's office to discuss her fight with Nikki and Dease slaps her in the face, telling her how unimportant she is. He presents Aisha with a gift, but refuses to give it to her until she provides him with any information about the other convicts. Dease then turns off the surveillance camera and forces Aisha to perform oral sex on him. After she leaves the office, Aisha finds Frances, punches her in the face for confessing that Aisha caused the fight, and steals her necklace. Aisha leaves around the corner and is surprised by Nikki, who stabs her and takes one of Frances‚Äô necklace back. After the incident, Michael takes Frances to Dease's office where Nelson questions her, but Frances provides no information about what she saw and is let go. Later that night, Dease and the other officers enter Nikki's cell and beat her, claiming that they know she stabbed Aisha. According to Sabrina's narration, however, Dease secretly loves Nikki and abuses her because she does not return the feelings. Michael enters the break room where Dease and the other guards are. They begin to discuss the possible closing of the prison and John Banks (Robert Archer Lynn), a white officer, is concerned about finding a new job. Dease claims that the loss of jobs is associated with untrained students, such as Michael, stealing their jobs, which creates tension between the other officers and Michael. As Michael attempts to defend himself and the mistreated female inmates, Dease proceeds to yell at him that these women have no respect for society and therefore, deserved to be treated poorly. Later, Michael does his own research on the prison system and discovers that these female convicts are being exploited for cheap labor. At night, Lil‚Äô Mama becomes very ill and the other convicts are concerned about her and her child's health. No officers come to help and Frances, who was a nurse, takes care of Lil‚Äô Mama throughout the night. During that night, Frances has a connecting conversation with both Nikki and Wet about why they were in jail. Wet shot a track runner who was sleeping with her boyfriend/husband in broad daylight and in front of 12 witnesses. Frances is then asked why she is in there and she explains that her husband was beating her, so she had finally had enough and shot him, landing her in prison. As Wet argues Frances' innocence, Nikki comments on why she was locked up for protecting herself. The next day in the sweatshop, Nikki thanks Frances for helping Lil‚Äô Mama and returns her necklace. The ladies receive bad news that Frances was denied an appeal, Nikki's children would not come to visit, and Wet gets a citation for creating a petition to end the prison's harsh working conditions. Also, Aisha returns after recovering from being stabbed. She and Nikki have an exchange of words when Aisha makes an insulting comment about Nikki's mother, tempting Nikki to fight her but is quickly broken up by close guards. Frances, Nikki, Lil‚Äô Mama, and Wet, now friends, sneak off to the kitchen where they share food and wine. They witness Dease secretly place a small bomb in the kitchen which goes off and alarms the other officers. As a result, Dease blames the incident on the inmates and has the kitchen rebuilt. After placing the prison on lockdown, Nelson approaches Dease, angry about the explosion and Wet's petition. Nelson states that he was informed that Dease created the explosion and threatens to fire Dease if he attempts any secret plans again. During a cell search, Officer Banks enters Wet's room and begins to damage her belongings, causing an altercation between Wet and Banks and Wet being taken to solitary confinement. When she returns, Wet and the other inmates collaborate and create another petition in a few days to present to Miller (Chris Dodson), a man that Nelson hopes will invest in the prison's cheap labor. When Miller arrives to the workstation where the inmates are, Frances stands and reads the inmates‚Äô demands for better working conditions and Nikki proceeds in giving the petition to Miller. Dease and Banks begin to hit Frances and Nikki and take them to solitary confinement where they stay for 6 days. During this period, they share stories and Frances helps Nikki overcome the temptation of snorting the cocaine that Dease takes to her room. They are let out and return to their routine. During a visit from her sister, Frances discovers that her daughter Maxine has been killed in a gang shooting. After returning from suicide watch, Frances and the other inmates devise a plan to get back at Dease with the help from Michael and Aisha, who is fed up with Dease for beating her. While Lil‚Äô Mama cleans Dease's office, Aisha enters and seduces Dease, who kicks out Lil‚Äô Mama and turns off the surveillance camera. After Lil‚Äô Mama returns briefly and turns the camera back on, Aisha makes it appear as if Dease is raping her. Caught on video, the ladies plan on giving the evidence to the governor. When Lil‚Äô Mama attempts to take the tape in Dease's office, Dease harasses and rapes her. When she returns to the jail cell, bleeding profusely and in terrible pain, the other inmates rush her to the infirmary where she suffers a miscarriage and dies. The inmates, who are violently upset, attack the doctor as he attempts to call Dease to have them escorted back to their jail cells. They hold the doctor at gunpoint and handcuff Michael to a chair. Wet shoots Dease as he enters and he in return fires a shot and hits the doctor. Nelson, informed of the situation, refuses to call the governor for assistance and instead orders the officers to be ready at the scene. In the infirmary, the convicts release Michael, handcuff the wounded Dease, and call Nelson, telling him he has one hour to get the governor on the phone. Nelson demands to speak with Dease in order to ensure that he is alive. The inmates put Dease on the phone and force him to tell Nelson that he raped Lil‚Äô Mama. When her back is turned, Dease attacks Frances and Nikki shoots Dease several times, killing him. Sergeant Cervantes (MC Lyte), the officer in charge, orders the inmates to surrender and Wet goes outside and kills an officer, after which Wet is shot and killed. After much thought, Frances and Nikki decide to exit the infirmary and are killed by the officers. Meanwhile, Aisha sneaks into Dease's office and retrieves the tape. During her final narration, Sabrina explains that after taking the evidence to a lawyer, the women file a lawsuit against the prison for their abuse and win the case. The prison is shut down and Nelson is indicted for making corrupt business deals and using the prison for his profit. Aisha is killed in a prison fight shortly after. Sabrina, now free, dedicates the inmates‚Äô victory to Nikki, Frances, Lil‚Äô Mama, and Wet for their courage. ==Cast== *Tichina Arnold as Aisha *Monica Calhoun as Wet *Da Brat as Sabrina *Chris Dodson as Miller *Jerry Foster as Doctor Moss *LisaRaye McCoy as Frances *Robert Lynn as Banks *Reed McCant as Warden Nelson *MC Lyte as Sergeant Cervantes *Clifton Powell as Captain Alan Dease *Mos Def as Michael *Lark Voorhies as Lil‚Äô Mama *N'Bushe Wright as Nikki Barnes ==Themes==  Prisons as business  Civil Brand's most recognizable theme is the use of the prisoner for a means of profit. Director Neema Barnette sought to expose the elements of the prison industrial complex and its effect on the inmates within a prison. Using relatable characters, she shows the inmate's perspective on working under harsh prison conditions in an attempt to persuade the audience to sympathize with the cast as they are exploited by the officers that run the prison. Barnette replaces the idea rehabilitation, a concept that is commonly associated with the US prison system, with the idea of exploitation, which, as her depiction of Whitehead Correctional Institute portrays, has become the norm in many facilities. Because the main concept of the film was harmful to the reputation of US prisons, Barnette stated that she had a difficult time having her film approved, which motivated Barnette to push forward with the film. In order to carry out the idea of exploitation replacing rehabilitation, Barnette focuses on the interaction between characters Warden Nelson (Reed R. McCants) and Captain Dease (Clifton Powell), the officials in charge of the prison. For example, Dease asks Nelson if the prison should be locked down after Aisha's stabbing, to which Nelson responds that the prisoners must keep working.Civil Brand. Dir. Neema Barnette. Lions Gate Films, 2002. DVD. Rather than find the culprit who stabbed Aisha to ensure the future safety of the prisoners, Nelson prefers that the prisoners keep working in order to continue making money. The importance of making a profit has taken over the prison's regulations and has caused the prison to be operated like a business at the expense of the prisoner's rights. The prisoners, aware that they are being exploited for cheap labor, face harsh working conditions they refer to as ‚Äúslave labor,‚Äù yet they are helpless because they have nobody to express their grievances to. In this film, the officers evidently place the business deal over the prisoners‚Äô human rights as they go to great lengths to comfort Miller (Chris Dodson), a businessman that takes an interest in investing in the prison's cheap labor. For example, when the prisoners attempt to protest the working conditions to Miller as he arrives to the workstation, Nelson does what he can to control the riot in order to salvage the possible business deal he has with Miller. Nelson hides the unhappiness of the inmates in order to provide his business partners with the guarantee that they are investing in a reliable source of labor. Neema Barnette's characterization of Nelson and Dease reflects the growing issues surrounding the privatization of the prison system. She states in an interview that more companies are taking their business to prisons for a cheaper source of labor, leading to a limited source of jobs for American workers and the creation of regulations such as the three strikes law, which keeps prisoners in jail after their sentences. By incorporating this idea into her film Civil Brand, filmmakers attempts to raise the question: when is labor taken too far?  Man vs. woman  The female inmates struggle with the abuse by men in their previous lives prior to their crimes as well as inside the prison walls. The director depicts the man's need for control over the woman by abusing her mentally and physically helps the audience favor the female inmates‚Äô self-empowerment as they take control of their bodies and put an end to their mistreatment. Barnette creates an idea that these women are battling against their male suppressors, creating an underlying feminist tone in the film. Before they enter the prison walls, Barnette portrays these women as the weak victims who were punished crimes provoked by the abuse from the men they were with. Frances was incarcerated for accidentally killing her husband in an effort to protect herself from his physical abuse, Lil‚Äô Mama for killing her stepfather after being raped and impregnated, Nikki for stealing cars at the request of her boyfriend, and Wet for shooting her ex-boyfriend's mistress. These women committed crimes that were in response to a man's abuse of power and creates a sense that these women, although criminals, are innocent women who were manipulated and taken advantage of in a man's world. As they attempt to stand up against their male opponents, Barnette demonstrates that these inmates were dismissed by the prison system and treated unequally. A battle for authority and respect is created with a division between the men, who are officers holding a powerful position in the prison, and the women, who are the inmates subjected to abuse and harsh labor conditions. Because the officers of this film abuse the women and are the antagonists in this film, the men that play these roles are cast as the enemy against the female inmates who are depicted as helpless victims. When these women attempt to defend themselves, they are resisted and ‚Äúput back in their place.‚Äù For example, when Nikki begs Dease not to take her back to solitary confinement after protesting a time-consuming job she was required to do, Dease forces her to state that she will be a ‚Äúgood bitch.‚Äù Forcing her to state these words creates a sense that Dease has obtained power over her and she is to follow his demands. Using physical and mental abuse, these women are taught to have a mentality that they are less of value than the men that control the prison. Neema uses the character of Sergeant Cervantes (MC Lyte) to emphasize the importance of unity and trust amongst the female against their male officers. There is a feeling amongst the female inmates that Cervantes, also female, has betrayed them for their male enemies. Sabrina states that the inmates, who attempted to confide in Cervantes because she was a female, realized that she was not on their side and therefore not to be trusted. Cervantes is depicted as a character caught in between male in female enemies, fitting into neither role. Her masculine characteristics and lack of trust amongst the inmates demonstrates that she is on the male's side, but the lack of respect that she receives from Dease and Nelson demonstrates that she does not share complete power with the males in the film.  Good inmate, bad cop  Irony plays a part in Civil Brand, as the roles typically seen in an actual prison are flipped during this film. Law enforcement, which is commonly viewed as a positive element of the community, takes on the opposite role in which they are portrayed as the antagonists who abuse their authority and exploit their prisoners. The criminals, who are commonly outlawed by society, are portrayed as the protagonists because they are the victims being abused. Because of this impression she gives in the film, Neema Brand persuades the audience to side in this case with the criminal as they ‚Äúfight the system‚Äù to earn back their human rights. Michael Meadows, the new officer at Whitehead Correctional Institute, gives off a feeling of innocence since he has yet to be converted into an abusive cop like the other cops. His care for the inmates and lack of similarity to the other cops, who have many more years of experience, gives a sense that individuals who are given power learn to take advantage of it and the prison system has the ability to transform outsiders like Michael into abusers such as Dease and the other officers in this film. ==Production== Prior to shooting the film, director Barnette researched the female prison complex in order to determine the style of inmates and film she wanted to create. She interviewed women inmates from Los Angeles and North Carolina, forced the actresses to go to prison to research their roles, and attempted to highlight the biggest issues that the inmates addressed regarding their abuse. Neema struggled with finalizing the location for filming the movie because of the complex issues that she chose to address. Civil Brand was originally intended to be filmed in North Carolina but the original script was denied by North Carolina correction officials who were afraid of the message the film depicted about the prison complex. As a result, Neema Barnette was forced to eliminate disputed elements in the original script and submitted a watered-down script to Tennessee officials, who approved the new script and allowed filming to begin in December 2000 at the Tennessee State Penitentiary. Once allowed to film, Barnette struggled with several production issues, including a smaller budget and restricted shooting schedule that was cut from 30 days to 15 days. After being shut down after 14 days of shooting, there were a total of 21 scenes missing from the film and Barnette waited for a year to receive extra shooting time only to receive 1 day, which was used to film 41 set-ups needed to piece the movie together. Lions Gate gave her a week to edit the final version of the film and in order to piece the scenes together and create fluidity, Barnette had Da Brat narrate more and cut out some original scenes she had. While filming, she used strategic camera techniques to hide missing elements of the film. Because of the reduced budget, Barnette was forced to shoot the cell block scenes in a static frame rather than complicated frames requiring a wheelchair camera, which she did not have. To hide the emptiness of the prison courtyard and lack of extras to play inmates, the director used camera techniques to section off one area of the courtyard and avoided shooting any reverse angles. ==Awards== Civil Brand won four awards and received one nomination. At the 2002 American Black Film Festival, director Neema Barnette received an award for Best Film and actor Clifton Powell won Best Performance by an Actor for his role as Captain Alan Dease.\\"Civil Brand (2002) - Awards\\", The Internet Movie Database. 13 February 2011. During an interview, Barnette stated that she was shocked to have received the award and it was amazing to be congratulated by her idols Robert Townsend, Keenen Ivory Wayans, and Chris Tucker.

Amongst the negative comments given, critics targeted Da Brat's narration, the cast's acting skills, and the indirect focus on the main issue of exploitation. They point out that this film is too similar to other films done in the past and that the filmmakers do a bad job of focusing the audience's attention the main issue of prison exploitation by instead pursuing the inmates‚Äô revenge against Clifton Powell's character, Dease. While some cast members have positive performances, critics point out that they are masked by the overacting by other characters. Critics were also bothered by the narration of Da Brat's character Sabrina, which they felt was unnatural and ‚Äúgives the film a comedic tone, but Civil Brand doesn't want to be a comedy; it wants to be a thought-provoking message movie.‚Äù ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2002 films Category:2000s prison drama films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:African-American drama films Category:American prison drama films Category:Social realism in film Category:Lionsgate films Category:2002 drama films ","title":"Civil Brand"},{"id":"5564325","text":"There have been two rail crashes near Welwyn Garden City railway station in Hertfordshire, England, one in 1935 and another less serious accident in 1957. ==1935 crash== On 15 June 1935, a train from London King's Cross to Leeds collided with a train from Kings Cross to Newcastle at night. Fourteen people were killed and 29 injured. The accident was a rear collision caused by a signalman's error. The signalman at Welwyn Garden City, who had been fairly recently appointed to the box, became confused and accepted two trains into the same block section. The Newcastle train, arriving first, received a signal check and was slowed to 15‚Äí20 mph; the Leeds train consisting of 11 coaches hauled by Class K3 2-6-0 No 4009 ran into it at approximately 65 mph. There were several significant features. Firstly, the modern rolling stock withstood the violent collision well, apart from the last coach which was totally destroyed; older coaches would have been crushed, with much heavier loss of life. Secondly, the Inspecting Officer felt that the signalman had been promoted beyond his level of competence for such a busy box, and the assessment and training procedures for signalmen should be improved. Thirdly, he recommended that the block instruments should be linked to the track circuits to prevent future occurrences in such a way that a \\"Line clear\\" indication could only be given on the block instrument if the track circuits had registered passage of a train; this was widely adopted and known as Welwyn Control. ==1957 crash== A second unrelated accident took place here on 7 January 1957; this was another rear collision. This accident took place at dawn about half a mile south of the station, and was due to the driver of an Aberdeen to London express passing signals at danger in mist, even failing to notice emergency detonators set off by the signalman. The express which was travelling at around 60‚Äí65 mph, collided with the rear end of a local train which had just pulled away from the station, and was travelling at around 30‚Äí35 mph. The rear coach of the local train was wrecked in the collision and two more were overturned. One passenger in the local train was killed and 25 injured. The locomotive of the express overturned and the driver suffered severe shock. == See also == * Lists of rail accidents ==External links== * Railways Archive summary and official accident report for 1935 collision *Railways Archive summary and official accident report for 1957 collision Category:Railway accidents and incidents in Hertfordshire Category:History of Hertfordshire Category:Railway accidents in 1935 Category:1935 in England Category:Railway accidents in 1957 Category:Railway accidents involving fog Category:20th century in Hertfordshire Category:1935 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:June 1935 events Category:Railway accidents caused by signaller's error Category:January 1957 events Category:1957 in England ","title":"Welwyn Garden City rail crashes"},{"id":"5564326","text":"Peter Cellier (born 12 July 1928) is an English actor who has appeared in film, stage and television.

In 1318‚Äì1319, she was Sweden's de facto ruler, and from 1319 until 1326, she was Sweden's first de jure female regent. ==Life== Early life Ingeborg was born as the only legitimate daughter of King H√•kon V of Norway from his marriage with Euphemia of R√ºgen. As a child, she was first betrothed to Magnus Birgerson, the son and designated heir of Birger, King of Sweden. Soon afterwards the engagement was however broken for altered political reasons, and in 1305 she was betrothed to Eric, Duke of S√∂dermanland, a younger brother of King Birger, thus uncle of her first betrothed. In 1312, Ingeborg and Eric were formally married in a double wedding in Oslo; at the same time, her cousin Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway, married Eric's brother duke Valdemar Magnusson. At her wedding, her mother Queen Euphemia had published the recently translated (by her command) famous poems, the Euphemia songs. The couple had two children before Duke Eric was murdered. Leader of the Ducal party Upon the imprisonment of her spouse and her brother-in-law, she and her cousin and sister-in-law, Ingeborg Eriksdottir, became the leaders of their spouses' followers. On 16 April 1318, the two duchesses Ingeborg made a treaty in Kalmar with the Danish duke Christoffer of Halland-Sams√∂ and archbishop Esgar of Lund to free their husbands and not to make peace with the kings of Sweden and Denmark before they agreed to this, and the two duchesses promised to honor the promises they gave in return in the names of their husbands. Later the same year, their husbands were confirmed to have died. Regency Seal of Duchess Ingeborg; Regent of Norway 1319‚Äì1327, Regent of Sweden 1318‚Äì1326. Her son Magnus VII of Norway, at the age of 3, was proclaimed king of Norway upon her father's death, in rights devolved from her. Ingeborg was recognized as formal regent of her son in Norway. Soon, the Swedish nobility elected young Magnus king of Sweden after deposing Birger, and Ingeborg was made nominal regent of Sweden and given a seat and vote in the Swedish government and the title: Ingeborg, by the Grace of God, daughter of Haakon, duchess in the Kingdom of Sweden. Duchess Ingeborg held her own court at her residence in Varberg. Letters 1318-1321 reveal that powerful Swedish men took advantage of the young dowager duchess by having her issue, alone and over her own seal, documents to their advantage as compensation for their support of the murdered dukes Eric and Waldemar and of little Magnus's right to the throne.Professor Grethe Auth√©n Blom in Norge i union p√• 1300-tallet 1 p. 43 The exact position of Ingeborg in the regency council is hard to define properly due to the documentation. Mats Kettilumndsson, her ally, presided over the Swedish regency council \\"alongside\\" the two \\"duchesses Ingeborg\\"; Ingeborg H√•kansdotter and her cousin and sister-in-law Ingeborg Eriksdottir. Magnus, already King of Norway, was elected King of Sweden with the approval of the Norwegian council in her presence. Ingeborg was the only one with a seat in both the Swedish and the Norwegian minor regency and council of state. She was duchess of her own fiefs, which were autonomous under her rule, and a large number of castles which controlled big areas thanks to their strategic positions. \\"Ingeborg's position at court was not well-defined: she was the king's mother (Kongemor), but without being a dowager queen.\\"Professor Grete Auth√©n Blom in Ingebj√∏rg med Guds misskunn Kong H√•kons datter, Hertuginne i Sviarike: Brudstykker av et politisk kvinneportrett Norsk Historisk Tidskrift, Oslo 1981 p. 425 Favourites She was criticized for her way of conducting her own politics without the counsel of the Swedish and Norwegian councils, and for using the royal seal of her son for her own wishes. 1 October 1320, she liberated Riga from its debts in her name on behalf of her son. She was known to make large donations to her supporters. Canute Porse had been one of the supporters of her spouse and was appointed governor of Varberg. Ingeborg surrounded herself with young foreign men, thought to affect her politics, of which Canute was the most known. 12 April 1321, the Swedish council, after receiving complaints from the Norwegian council regarding a rumour of crimes and disturbances in Ingeborg's lands made by foreigners, told the Norwegian council to advise Ingeborg to listen more to the advice of the old experienced men in the councils rather than to young inexperienced foreign men; a law was created which banned foreigners in the Swedish council. The Scania affair Ingeborg and Canute had the ambition to make the then Danish Scania a part of her possessions. In 1321, Ingeborg arranged a marriage with her daughter Euphemia and Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg. The marriage was arranged with the terms that Mecklenburg, Saxony, Holstein, Rendsburg and Schleswig would assist Ingeborg in the conquest of Scania. This was approved by the council of Norway but not Sweden. To finance the invasion, Ingeborg took a loan from Stralsund with free trade in Sweden and Norway as security. When Ingeborg's forces under command of Canute invaded Scania in 1322‚Äì23, Mecklenburg betrayed her to Denmark and the alliance was broken. Conflict with the councils and diminished power In 1322, open conflict broke out between Ingeborg and the Swedish regency council; the council of state made an agreement that no order from Ingeborg should hereby be accepted without the approval from the entire council, and all agreements made with her by individual councillors was hereby annulled. In 1323, Ingeborg was forced to accept the terms and give up several of her strategical castles and fiefs. 20 February 1323, also the Norwegian regency council rebelled against Ingeborg. She was accused of misusing the royal seal, to have broken the peace with Denmark and for greater costs, and was replaced as head of the regency. After 1323, Ingeborgs power was limited to what was approved by votes in the councils, which in practice had deposed her. 14 February 1326, in exchange for having her debts paid, Ingeborg gave up several fiefs and was forced to send Canute into exile and was stripped from all political authority in the Swedish regency council. In the Norwegian regency council, however, her signature was still needed in the peace treaty between Norway and S√∂nderjylland 14 June 1327. Ingeborg married her lover Canute Porse (d. 1330), a noble from less than royal circles, in 1327. While Canute was allowed to become Duke of Halland and holder of Ingeborg's inherited estates, her marriage was another reason why Swedes, and also increasingly Norwegians, did not allow Ingeborg to use her governmental power in these kingdoms. The year of her second marriage, Ingeborg was stripped from her power also in the Norwegian regency council. Later life Her husband was made Duke of Estonia in 1329. In 1330, she again became a widow. Her younger sons became dukes of Halland. Her eldest son became an adult in 1332, and the same year, Ingeborg secured Swedish superiority (until 1360) over Scania. After the death of her second husband, Ingeborg again took an important position in the life of her son the king, but it is not known how much influence she had on him. In 1336, Ingeborg welcomed her daughter Euphemia and her son-in-law Albert of Mecklenburg, Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe- Wittenberg and Henry of Holstein with her own fleet to the coronation of her son and his wife in Stockholm. In 1341, Ingeborg and the counts Henry and Claus of Holstein went to war against Valdemar of Schleswig, John of Holstein and the Hanseatic league in Denmark. Ingeborg was residing at Kalundborg in Denmark at the time and was attacked by King Valdemar IV there; after two years of alternating conflicts and agreements the matter was settled against King Valdemar, who however regained Copenhagen Castle.Ulf Sundberg in Medeltidens svenska krig Stockholm 1999 pp. 147-149 King Magnus sealed the peace by telling Valdemar to keep the promise he had made to Ingeborg in the peace treaty. In 1350, she inherited the title and position of Duke of Halland from her younger son. ==Children and family== With Eric, Duke of S√∂dermanland, Ingeborg had two children: * Magnus VII of Norway (1316‚Äì1374) * Euphemia of Sweden, duchess of Mecklenburg (1317‚Äìc. 1370) With Canute Porse, Duke of Halland and Estonia, Ingeborg had three children: * Haakon, Duke of Halland, died 1350 * Canute, Duke of Halland, died 1350 * Birgitta,Dronning Margrete: Valdemar danekonges datter : hendes ungdom married Jon Hafthorsson and had issue ==Legacy== The controversy around Ingeborg's second marriage and the potential succession of her son Haakon to the Norwegian throne are an important part of the plot of the novel Kristin Lavransdatter by Sigrid Undset. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Den svenska historien.

Common examples are case endings, which indicate the grammatical case of nouns or adjectives, and verb endings, which form the conjugation of verbs. An inflectional suffix is sometimes called a desinence or a grammatical suffix or ending. Inflection changes the grammatical properties of a word within its syntactic category. Derivational suffixes can be divided into two categories: class-changing derivation and class-maintaining derivation. Particularly in the study of Semitic languages, suffixes are called afformatives, as they can alter the form of the words.

Turn! Turn!\\", or \\"Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)\\", is a song written by Pete Seeger in the late 1950s and first recorded in 1959. The lyrics ‚Äì except for the title, which is repeated throughout the song, and the final two lines ‚Äì consist of the first eight verses of the third chapter of the biblical Book of Ecclesiastes. The song was originally released in 1962 as \\"To Everything There Is a Season\\" on folk group the Limeliters' album Folk Matinee, and then some months later on Seeger's own The Bitter and the Sweet. The song became an international hit in late 1965 when it was adapted by the American folk rock group the Byrds. The single entered the U.S. chart at number 80 on October 23, 1965, before reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on December 4, 1965. In Canada, it reached number 3 on November 29, 1965, and also peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Lyrics== The lyrics are taken almost verbatim from the book of Ecclesiastes, as found in the King James Version (1611) of the Bible, () though the sequence of the words was rearranged for the song. Ecclesiastes is traditionally ascribed to King Solomon who would have written it in the 10th century BC, but believed by a significant group of biblical scholars to date much later, up to the third century BC. The Biblical text posits there being a time and place for all things: birth and death, laughter and sorrow, healing and killing, war and peace, and so on. The lines are open to myriad interpretations, but Seeger's song presents them as a plea for world peace because of the closing line: \\"a time for peace, I swear it's not too late.\\" This line and the title phrase \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" are the only parts of the lyric written by Seeger himself. In 1999, Seeger arranged for 45% of the songwriting royalties for \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" to be donated to the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions. He kept 50% of the royalties for his own music and took a further 5% for the lyrics because, in Seeger's own words, \\"[in addition to the music] I did write six words and one more word repeated three times.\\" Seeger's handwritten lyrics to the song were among documents donated to New York University by the Communist Party USA in March 2007. The song is notable for being one of a few instances in popular music in which a large portion of the Bible is set to music, other examples being the Melodians' (and Boney M's) \\"Rivers of Babylon\\", Sister Janet Mead's \\"The Lord's Prayer\\", U2's \\"40\\", Sinead O'Connor's \\"Psalm 33\\" and Cliff Richard's \\"The Millennium Prayer\\". Since Ecclesiastes is traditionally ascribed to King Solomon in the 10th century BC, the Byrds' 1965 recording of the song holds the distinction in the U.S. of being the number 1 hit with the oldest lyrics. The song was published in illustrated book form by Simon & Schuster in September 2003, with an accompanying CD which contained both Seeger's and the Byrds' recordings of the song. Wendy Anderson Halperin created a set of detailed illustrations for each set of opposites which are reminiscent of mandalas. The book also includes the Ecclesiastes text from the King James version of the Bible. ==Renditions== Early folk versions The song was first released by the folk group the Limeliters on their 1962 album Folk Matinee, under the title \\"To Everything There Is a Season\\". The Limeliters' version predated the release of Seeger's own version by several months. One of the Limeliters' backing musicians at this time was Jim McGuinn (aka Roger McGuinn), who would later record the song with his band the Byrds and, prior to that, arrange the song for folk singer Judy Collins on her 1963 album, Judy Collins 3. Collins' recording of the song was retitled as \\"Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)\\", a title that would be retained by the Byrds, though it was shortened to \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" on the front cover of the album of the same name and the song became generally known by the shorter version, appearing as such on most later Byrds compilations. In 1963 Marlene Dietrich recorded \\"F√ºr alles kommt die Zeit (Glaub', Glaub)\\", Max Colpet's German translation of the song. Dietrich was backed by a Burt Bacharach conducted studio orchestra, and the song was released as a single. Australian folk singer Gary Shearston also recorded a version of the song for his 1964 album Songs of Our Time, with the title \\"Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)\\". The Byrds' version \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" was adapted by the Byrds in a folk rock arrangement and released as a single by Columbia Records on October 1, 1965. The song was also included on the band's second album, Turn! Turn! Turn!, which was released on December 6, 1965. The Byrds' single is the most successful recorded version of the song, having reached number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts and number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. The B-side of the single was band member Gene Clark's original composition, \\"She Don't Care About Time\\". \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" had first been arranged by the Byrds' lead guitarist Jim McGuinn in a chamber-folk style during sessions for Judy Collins' 1963 album, Judy Collins 3. The idea of reviving the song came to McGuinn during the Byrds' July 1965 tour of the American Midwest, when his future wife, Dolores, requested the tune on the Byrds' tour bus. The rendering that McGuinn dutifully played came out sounding not like a folk song but more like a rock/folk hybrid, perfectly in keeping with the Byrds' status as pioneers of the folk rock genre. McGuinn explained, \\"It was a standard folk song by that time, but I played it and it came out rock 'n' roll because that's what I was programmed to do like a computer. I couldn't do it as it was traditionally. It came out with that samba beat, and we thought it would make a good single.\\" The master recording of the song reportedly took the Byrds 78 takes, spread over five days of recording, to complete. Music journalist William Ruhlmann has pointed out that the song's plea for peace and tolerance struck a nerve with the American record buying public as the Vietnam War escalated. The single also solidified folk rock as a chart trend and, like the band's previous hits, continued the Byrds' successful mix of vocal harmony and jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar playing. Pete Seeger expressed his approval of the Byrds' rendering of the song.Show 33 ‚Äì Revolt of the Fat Angel: American musicians respond to the British invaders. [Part 1] : UNT Digital Library During 1965 and 1966, the band performed the song on the television programs Hollywood A Go-Go, Shindig!, The Ed Sullivan Show, and Where the Action Is, as well as in the concert film, The Big T.N.T. Show. Additionally, the song would go on to become a staple of the Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of the Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman in January 1989. In addition to its appearance on the Turn! Turn! Turn! album, the song also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965‚Äì1967, Volume 1, The Byrds, 20 Essential Tracks From The Boxed Set: 1965-1990, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds and There Is a Season. The recording has been featured in numerous movies and TV shows, including 1983's Heart Like a Wheel, 1994's Forrest Gump, and 2002's In America. Following Joe Cocker's cover of \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", the song was the first to be played in the initial episode of the television series The Wonder Years. It was also used in a Wonder Years parody, during The Simpsons episode \\"Three Men and a Comic Book\\". In 2003, it was used in the closing sequence of the Cold Case episode \\"A Time to Hate\\" (Season One, episode 7) and for the closing credits of episode 3 of Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's 2017 documentary The Vietnam War. ;Personnel *Jim McGuinn ‚Äì lead guitar, vocals *Gene Clark ‚Äì rhythm guitar, tambourine, vocals *David Crosby ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals *Chris Hillman ‚Äì electric bass *Michael Clarke ‚Äì drums Other cover versions The song has been covered by many other artists: * The Seekers recorded it in 1966 for their Come the Day album.

Turn! Turn!"},{"id":"5564392","text":"is a short-lived SD Gundam manga series, a spin-off from the popular Gundam anime. It is authored by Masato Ichishiki and ran in Comic Bom Bom. The Bancho in the title is Japanese slang for student delinquents ==Story== The series appears to be a sequel to the earlier SD Gundam Musha Maruden. Official relations were formed between Earth and the land of Ark. At an inter-racial school attended by humans and Mobile Citizens, young Ryuunosuke befriends fellow student Kokuryu. Life at the school can sometimes be fierce, with student gangs seeking to disrupt the harmony. But in the face of this, Kokuryu reveals a powerful ability- although he normally looks like a little kid, he can transform into the maturer samurai warrior Kokuryu Gundam. The series initially involves his battles against similar robotic creatures along with Gundam friends such as the bish≈çnen Hakuou Gundam and good natured/rough and ready Sekijishi Gundam. Eventually a mysterious group emerges, forcing Kokuryu and company to leave simple schoolyard scraps behind and engage in life or death combat. The general merchandising gimmick for this series involves the Gundam's being able to combine together. This is similar to the gimmick for the series Transformers: Energon ==Characters== Kokuryu's child (or chibi) form Each of the Gundams are introduced in an order with visual similarities to the same order of the Universal Century: :Kokuryu Gundam resembles the RX-78GP01 Gundam \\"Zephirantes\\" from Mobile Suit Gundam 0083:stardust memory :Hakuou Gundam resembles the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam :Sekijishi Gundam resembles the MSZ-010 Double Zeta Gundam from Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ :Seirou Gundam resembles the RX-78GP02A Gundam \\"Physalis\\" from Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory Main Characters *Kokuryu Gundam (ÈªíÈæçÈ†ëÈßÑÁÑ°(„Åì„Åè„Çä„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„Åå„Çì„Å†„ÇÄ)) - \\"Black Dragon Gundam\\". A transfer student from the land of Ark and star of the story, Kokuryu is similar to many past SD Gundam leads and leads of the sh≈çnen genre. Although generally energetic and easy going, he also possesses a strong sense of justice and fiery temper which triggers his transformation to Bancho form. When Ryuunosuke and himself were brutally attacked by the Dom Alliance, his rage sparked the Hot-Blooded Circuit (Nekketsu Kairo/ÁÜ±Ë°ÄÂõûË∑Ø(„Å≠„Å£„Åë„Å§„Åã„ÅÑ„Çç)). In his Bancho form he has access to a range of powerful weapons including his signature samurai sword, leg cannons and an unbreakable head crest which can deflect most attacks. He also suffers a slight personality change; aware of his own power, the maturer Kokuryu is a Gundam of few words who often only talks to belittle his opponent for an ineffective attack. However, he still retains a strong desire to protect innocents and will panic if his opponent endangers his friends. The main causes of anger for him are insults, such as someone threatening his friends or his pride (usually done by Hakuou). He usually reverts to his child form once his adrenaline rush has worn off. His strength in battle is countered by his struggles with his school work, where he consistently receives low grades due to a mix of his own inability and having his time eaten up by his recent adventures. He has an addiction to pudding, once over eating so many of them he lacked the energy and motivation to transform. Kokuryu's transformed form is a mix of the look of a samurai and the stereotypical Japanese school punk. His personal symbol is a star. Near the end of the series, Kokuryu seemingly perished attempting to destroy the Axis that was about to strike Earth (a reference to Char's Counterattack). However, he returned alive and well a few years later, after having crashed down in America. :*Kokuryuu Gundam Special Attack (ÈæçÈ†ëÈßÑÁÑ°„ÉªÁâπÊîª(„Åì„Åè„Çä„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„Åå„Çì„Å†„ÇÄ„Éª„Å®„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ))- After Kokuryu is mortally wounded by Seirou, Ryuunosuke becomes desperate to find a way to save his friend. Venturing out with the Dom Alliance he encounters the Death Teacher Fukutsuzawa, who claims to be capable of healing Kokuryu. What he does, however, is remove the Hot- Blooded Circuit, plunging Kokuryuu into catatonia, and implanting it in his own created Banchou, Grey. As Ryuunosuke and the others are thrashed, their memories of Kokuryuu inspire them to launch one final attack: a simultaneous headbutt very much like Kokuryuu's trademark Sunrise attack. This event reawakens Kokuryuu and spurs his transformation into a new form. This new look includes flame patterns on his armour and clothes and a new sword. This form lasted only a short period and Kokuryu soon powered down into his standard mature form during a second battle with Seirou. He has since used it twice more in battles where his regular Banchou form has proven too weak to win. The fact it can only be used for a few minutes and the end of the limit signalled by a beeping sound marks it as a possible reference to Ultraman. *Yoshikumo Ryuunosuke (ËâØÈõ≤Èæç‰πã‰ªã(„Çà„Åó„Åè„ÇÇ„Çä„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„ÅÆ„Åô„Åë)) - A young boy who is bullied by the Dom Alliance at school, Ryuunosuke befriends Kokuryu when the latter is transferred to his school, becomes his classmate and his homestay charge. This friendship led to Kokuryu transforming for the first time to protect Ryuunosuke and himself from an unprovoked attack by the Doms. Ryuunosuke is an only child who lives with his mother. His hobby is building Gunpla models, an interest which becomes of benefit to Kokuryu once they discover model kit parts can become actual upgrades for Mobile Citizens. After Kokuryuu sacrifices himself against the axis, Ryuunosuke goes on to graduate from primary school and is seen as a ninth-grader at the end of the final chapter. *Dom Alliance (ÊÄíÊ≠¶ÈÄ£Âêà(„Å©„ÇÄ„Çå„Çì„Åî„ÅÜ)) - Initially a small student gang who cruelly victimizes Ryuunosuke with intense beatings, they become allies out of respect when Kokuryu bests them in a fight. After helping to fight off the Tears Of Time Group, they earn new respect from their fellow students and begin to become better members of society. Their leader is the mohawk wearing Gaia Dom and their signature attack is Jet Scream Attack. *Hakuou Gundam (ÁôΩÂá∞È†ëÈßÑÁÑ°(„ÅØ„Åè„Åä„ÅÜ„Åå„Çì„Å†„ÇÄ))- \\"White Phoenix Gundam\\". This handsome gentleman student council president of the 7th Musha Elementary School with a devoted fanbase of young women and an ego to match, Hakuou Gundam is yet another character based in a typical anime character type (the refined pretty boy). Although publicly he presents himself as friendly and good natured, in private he is revealed to be more calculating. Possessing a large ego, he personally arranged a tournament in an attempt to beat Kokuryu in a fight, where they were revealed to be evenly matched and managed to completely destroy the large stadium Hakuou had booked for their duel. Hakuou has somehow learned how to remain in his mature form constantly though excessive energy use will revert him to his child form, as was the case during his fight with Kokuryu. Once reverted to his child form he loses his usual cool and desperately demands that people show him respect. He also appears to know of the concept of Gigantic Musha Mode, and drops subtle hints that his battle against Kokuryu also serves as a test to see if his opponent would give him a significant power boost if combined with. He launched a mission to rescue the captives of Gaza Captain which forced him to yet again team with Kokuryu and new ally Sekijishi. Although his attitude and charms can often annoy Kokuryu, they are often forced to be allies. Hakuou's long hair can split in half and attach to his arms as feathers, giving him the ability to fly. His personal symbol is a bird. At the end of the series he is shown to have become student council president at his new middle high school, having been elected the first year he came. He may have feelings for Tomoe. *Hakuou Gundam Elegant (ÁôΩÂá∞È†ëÈßÑÁÑ°È¢ØÁàΩ(„ÅØ„Åè„Åä„ÅÜ„Åå„Çì„Å†„ÇÄ„Åà„Çå„Åå„Çì„Å®))- After learning of Kokuryu's upgrade, Hakuou tries without luck to grant himself a similar form to match his rival. A mysterious silent tengu-like Gundam engages him in combat, easily outmatching his skill. When Hakuou's aides intervene, the mysterious Gundam attacks them too. Desperate to save his friends and aware of their importance to him, Hakuou unlocks his new form. Emerging from a giant white rose bud, he is dressed much like a buccaneer and shares a similar power growth to Kokuryu. Likewise, the form lasts only a short time (currently, even shorter than Kokuryu's upgrade). Hakuou summoned the power again to help Kokuryuu in the final battle. *Sekijishi Gundam (Ëµ§ÁçÖÂ≠êÈ†ëÈßÑÁÑ°(„Åõ„Åç„Åò„Åó„Åå„Çì„Å†„ÇÄ)) - \\"Red Lion Gundam\\". A good natured, rough and ready Gundam Bancho who Kokuryu and Ryuunosuke encounter during a class visit to the Doros Ocean Primary School. Aware of Gaza Captain's evil plans to take over another beach, Sekijishi attacks the school and attempts to destroy it with a missile. Kokuryu stops him and convinces him that his friends consider him more important than the beach. Soon after he saves Kokuryu from an assassination attempt from Seirou by using the 'forbidden' attack from his head mounted cannon. Seirou abducted him, leading to Kokuryu and company heading out to save him. Upon finding him, Seirou had briefly brainwashed him in order to gain the power of Gigantic Musha Mode. After the combination wore off, Sekijishi regained his memory. Sekijishi resembles a lion, to the point where he can transform into an animal-like form for combat and his powered down state resembles a lion cub or even a 'shiisaa'. He will often revert to this cub state after using his head cannon. His side skirt armour converts into a personal surfboard and he is devoted to the sea and surfing, even calling himself 'a king of the land who loves the sea'. His personal symbol is a shark. Ryuunosuke and his classmates fondly call him 'Set-chan'. He is last seen returning to protecting the oceans from harm. *Seirou Gundam (ÈùíÁãºÈ†ëÈßÑÁÑ°(„Åõ„ÅÑ„Çç„ÅÜ„Åå„Çì„Å†„ÇÄ)) - \\"Blue Wolf Gundam\\". A mysterious Bancho who resembles a wolf. The top pupil of the 6th Northeast Circle Musha Primary School, Seirou has been trained as a deadly hunter/killer. As a final test he hunted down and slaughtered all three of his teachers. He has the ability to teleport and protect himself via a form of sub-space. Seirou is allied with Desth Teacher Fukutsuzawa for a mysterious purpose. After a number of failed attempts, Seirou succeeded in sniping Kokuryu with a special bullet which left Kokuryu near death. After eventually recovering, Kokuryu and Seirou engaged in a multi-stage duel. After blowing through various power ups and gimmicks, the two engaged in a bare knuckle fight with Seirou personally removing his shields and weapons. The fight cost Seirou his left arm and destroyed the building around them. In the confusion, he and Fukutsuzawa slipped away and left for parts unknown. Since then, he has had a one panel cameo in a bonus page wishing readers a happy New Year 2007. How canonical this appearance is in regards to the main story is currently unknown. His personal symbol is a Death Army eye. In the early days of the Elite armour experiments, One of the subjects went wild due to the side effects of the armour. Seirou stepped in to stop him, but his one blow killed the boy. The experiments were halted and the guilt-wracked Seirou made Fukutsuzawa modify his right hand so it could only be used to throw three Blue Thunder (ÈùíÊï£Êâì(„Éñ„É´„Éº„Çµ„É≥„ÉÄ„Éº)) punches before the arm exploded. However, when Kokuryuu and Seirou fought, Kokuryuu countered the energy of the explosion with his own Sunrise attack before knocking him out, saving Seirou's life and ending the fight. Seirou apparently also has a talent for 'chilling' puns. Seirou reappears in the final battle, fully repaired and now an ally to Kokuryu. He is last seen training to engage Kokuryuu once more, with giant weights wrapped round his arms with chains. *Fukutsuzawa Yukichi (‰∏çÂ±àÊ≤¢ÂãáÊ∞óÁü•(„Åµ„Åè„Å§„Åñ„Çè„ÇÜ„Åç„Å°)) - A mysterious man who \\"heals\\" Kokuryu after he is shot by Seirou. He appears to be part of the original Elite armour projects and his left eye is cybernetic, with a scar across it. He originally served as a teacher but now works as an engineer. His talents enable him to grant banchou warriors great strength and power. Although initially of questionable motives, both he and Seirou provide aid when Kyouji appears, revealing the history of the Elites. He eventually returned to teaching. *Gu-rei (ÂÅ∂-Ôºê(„Åê„Çå„Éº))- After the Dom Alliance make short work of a wave of drones, Fukutsuzawa summons the ninja-like Gu-rei who serves as an example of his work. Via the use of an orbital cannon and a long-nosed tengu mask he can use himself as a living bullet to kill enemies. He attempts this on the newly powered up Kokuryu but succeeds only in cracking his own head, after which Kokuryu finishes him off by punching through his chest. After Seirou and Fukutsuzawa escaped from Kokuryu, they found a still active remnant of one of Gu-rei's eyes. Fukutsuzawa subtely implied using this to build an improved Gu-rei, also known as Haien (\\"Grey Ape Gundam\\"). He activated this improved version to help during the final battle, and he managed to take out a storm of Earth-bound missiles on his own. He is last seen as a student of Fukutsuzawa. *Banchou Fusion Unofficial name- After the Gigantic Musha Modes prove ineffective, Koubusai granted Kokuryu, Hakuou, Sekijishi, Seirou and Gu-rei the power to combine together into a single warrior. This new Banchou primarily resembled Kokuryu, with elements of the other four. Gigantic Musha Modes - Gachinko *Kokuryu and Hakuou Combined - Gigantic Musha Mode - When Big-Zami is transformed into a rampaging monster, Kokuryu and Hakuou are forced to combine together to combat her. In this combined form Hakuou forms the upper body whilst Kokuryu forms the legs (a fact Kokuryu was less than happy about), with the overall form being of giant size. It is incredibly powerful but currently Kokuryu and Hakuou can only form it for a short amount of time. Its attack is Mohican. When facing Kyouji, the pair reversed the combination with Kokuryu now serving as the upper body and Hakuou as the legs. *Seirou Combiner - Ankoku Daiseirou/Dark Great Seirou (ÊöóÈªíÂ§ßÈùíÁãº(„ÅÇ„Çì„Åì„Åè„Å†„ÅÑ„Åõ„ÅÑ„Çç„ÅÜ))- Upon initially facing the newly powered up Kokuryu, Seirou reveals his own stand alone Gigantic Musha Mode where he combines with at least three SD Gundam kits. Notably, the kits used are of past SD Gundam villains. Despite his great firepower, he is no match for Kokuryu's Geta Kick and is forced to call upon a brainwashed Sekijishi for further power. *Seirou and Sekijishi Combined - Nikoichi Kyodai Juuou/Giant Beastlord (ÂêàË∫´„É¢„Éº„ÉâË™çÊîª‰∏ÄËá¥ Â∑®Â§ßÁç£Áéã(„Åå„Å£„Åó„Çì„ÇÇ„Éº„Å©„Å´„Åì„ÅÑ„Å° „Åç„Çá„Å†„ÅÑ„Åò„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„Åä„ÅÜ))- During his showdown with Kokuryu, Seirou forces a brainwashed Sekijishi to combine with him and form a second Gigantic Musha Mode. It resembles a four- legged animal, with Seirou at the front and Sekijishi at the back. When facing Kyouji, the pair reversed the combination with Sekijishi now serving as the front and Seirou as the back. Musha Nataku *Kokuryuu Daibujin („Åì„Åè„Çä„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„Å†„ÅÑ„Å∂„Åò„Çì)- When forced to fight the combined form of Seirou and Sekijishi, Ryuunosuke provides Kokuryu with a Musha Nataku kit, which he combines with to form the gigantic Kokuryu Daibujin. This form takes advantage of the kits own Gigantic Musha Mode, with Kokuryu serving as the upper body and Nataku as the legs. The originally designed model kit version of this design included two further kits. The manga version uses only the Musha Nataku components, though increases their use by adding Nataku's shoulder armour and arms as further armour for the legs. Kokuryu also wields Nataku's large trident. Similar to the combination of Kokuryu and Hakuou, Kokuryu and Nataku's usual heads serve as shoulder armour whilst Kokuryu Daibujin has a head designer closer to that of Gundam tradition including a v-fin on the forehead. Minor Characters *Jaburou Doterai (ÂúüÊâãÊù•Ëã•Ê≠¶ÈÉé(„Å©„Å¶„Çâ„ÅÑ„Åò„ÇÉ„Å∂„Çç„ÅÜ)) - Teacher of Kokuryu and Ryuunosuke's class, he serves as a running gag. He will often try to stop the mecha battles only to be quickly dealt with. When Kokuryu and the others departed to rescue Sekijishi, he intended to go with but missed the train. He finally caught up to them in the aftermath, finding them all bathing in an onsen. Angered by Kokuryuu's ignoring his concern, he slapped Kokuryuu (though greatly bruising his hand in the process). Kokuryuu mentions that one blow hurt more than Seirou's punch. Jaburou manages to shock Kokuryuu out of Banchou mode by threatening to make him take another make-up exam (the first one being ruined by the appearance of Seirou and the Death Teachers). At the end of the series Jaburou transfers to Ryuunosuke's middle high school, as does Elizabeth. *Mama (Èæç‰πã‰ªã„ÅÆ„Éû„Éû(„Çä„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„ÅÆ„Åô„Åë„ÅÆ„Éû„Éû))- Ryuunosuke's mother. She is overtly positive and bubbly, to extremes which can embarrass her son (such as wedging Kokuryu's face into her breasts to give him a hug). She pops up scantily clad at the hot springs along with Jaburo, much to the delight of the Doms and Kokuryu (and the embarrassment of her son). *Tears Of Time Group'/Toki no Namida-gumi (ÊôÇ‰πÉÊÆ¥Âº•ÈôÄÁµÑ(„Éà„Ç≠„Éé„Éä„Éü„ÉÄ„Åê„Åø)) - A gang from the same school as Hakuou, they feud with the Dom Alliance. Kokuryu beat their leader in a one-on-one fight and in doing so learned of the upgrade potential of Gunpla parts, after witnessing The O using parts from a Hadou Musha Mazaku kit. Their leader is The-O/Geo. *Hyaku-Shiki Squad (ÁôæÊ≠ªÈ¨ºÈöä(„Å≤„ÇÉ„Åè„Åó„Åç„Åü„ÅÑ))- A 100-man strong gang from the 7th Musha Elementary School, Hakuou convinces them to take part in a school pride contest to gauge Kokuryu's strength. Kokuryu managed to beat all of them with ease, finishing off their leader with the use of Rekka Dai Hagane's arms. Their leader is Hyaku-Shiki. *Kazueru and Kazuaru- Two seemingly identical boys who are always by Hakuou's side. Kazueru's fringe covers his right eye; Kazuaru's, his left (although there is one panel when this is seemingly reversed). They often serve as aides, bodyguards and/or muscle. After Hakuou was reverted to child form he forced one of them to allow him to sit in their collar and create the illusion he was still in his Bancho form. This plan was foiled when Tomoe grabbed him by the collar for trash talking her, unaware of the deception. They are fully devoted to Hakuou, even risking their lives to save him from attack. *Lady Tomoe („Éà„É¢„Ç®Âæ°Ââç(„Å®„ÇÇ„Åà„Åî„Åú„Çì)) - Real name Tomoe Gouzen (ËΩüÁÑ∂ÈóòÁáÉ(„Åî„ÅÜ„Åú„Çì„Å®„ÇÇ„Åà)), she is a tomboy from the 7th School. Just as strong as any male or Mobile Citizen in the school she will only use her strength against those she sees as arrogant, such as Hakuou. Her signature move is the Tomoe Throw, capable of sending enemies to great heights. She encountered Hakuou shortly after his loss to Kokuryu and unintentionally ruined his attempts to hide his transformation back into child form. Despite mocking his smaller form, she was saved by Hakuou after nearly being crushed by a rampaging Big Zami. She develops a crush on Hakuou afterwards but refuses to openly admit it, covering her embarrassment with yet another Tomoe Throw. She later ends up in the same high-class middle high as Hakuou. *Big Zami („Éì„Ç∞„Ç∂Áæé) - Tomoe's protegee, her signature attack is the Hyakumon Kick. She became the victim of Death Teacher, who transformed her briefly into a rampaging Big Zam. Upon being rescued she accidentally landed a kiss on Gaia Dom. He has fallen for her, but she still thinks she has kissed Kokuryuu instead. At the end of the series it is said she has gone through an 'image change' and turned herself into a small, sweet blonde girl, but even the editor doubts the fact this is possible. *Elizabeth - Real name Eri Saezu, she works as a teacher and guidance counsellor at the 3rd Musha Elementary School and is generally respected by the students. She spoke to Kokuryu and Enosuke when the two were having difficulty with their studies. During a test the two took, National Language Death Teacher abducted and impersonated her with a simple paper mask. Jaburou was unable to tell the difference. *Ennosuke - Another student at the 3rd Musha Elementary School, Ennosuke is very quiet and shy. He does not do well on exams, which results in lectures from his parents. When he appears, it is a known fact that whenever an exam goes on, he escapes to the school's chicken enclosure. When he and Kokuryu faced a repeat test together, Kokuryu urged him to believe in himself and be proud of his efforts, even if the results don't turn out well. Ennosuke works on a small chicken farm and has a friend who appears to be another young Gundam who starts to look up to Kokuryuu Bancho. In the epilogue both show great growth, with Ennosuke now more outgoing and his Gundam friend having achieved a powerful Banchou form similar to that of Kokuryu, called Kabuki Gundam. (Kabuki Gundam resembles, for some reason, a Red Indian chief.) *Senbee(Êà¶ÂÖµË°õ(„Åõ„Çì„Åπ„Åà))- A mysterious, swift and powerful warrior who serves Koubusai. While he was armoured to look like a tengu, specifically a karasu- tengu, the beak was part of a disguise. He was ordered to attack Hakuou to unleash his true power. Senbee is skilled in swordplay and also uses a powerful weapon known as the Sun Cannon (Nichirin Bakuhou (Êó•Ëº™ÁàÜÁ†≤)). *Koubusai (ÂÖâÊ≠¶Êñâ(„Åì„ÅÜ„Å∂„Åï„ÅÑ))- An aged and wise Gundam. He warned Kokuryu and Hakuou of the true puppetmaster of the current threats and implied they would need to master their new forms in order to create a new Gigantic Musha powerful enough to defeat this evil. However, both young Gundams misunderstood and have personally boasted they alone will become this powerful warrior. *Jean Claude Gundam - A young upstart who enters Ryuunosuke's middle high school the same year he is about to graduate. A Gundam 'with the heart of a lion' and agile legs, he has a slightly Rastafarian look to him. He has the unfortunate distinction of being thrashed by both Kabuki Gundam and Ankokuryuu Gundam (Saikyouin) on the same day. * Retsumaru and Mobile Musha Rekka Dai Hagane from Ichishiki's previous series SD Gundam Force Emaki Musharetsuden appear as props to explain the hobby of SD kit customising. Later, Kokuryu briefly uses Rekka Dai Hagane's arms. Enemies Allies and enemies of Kokuryu *Death Teachers- The villainous factulty of the 6th Northeast Circle Musha Primary School. Soon after Kokuryu transfers, they begin to harass the other schools. Despite being based on various enemy mecha from across the Gundam franchise, all have the eye design introduced by the Death Army in Mobile Fighter G Gundam. **Science Death Teacher (Áó¢Âä†Âá∂Â∏´(„É™„Ç´„Éá„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„ÉÅ„É£„Éº))- The first Death Teacher to appear, resembling the Death Master from Mobile Fighter G Gundam. He attached a device to Big-Zami which transformed her into a rampaging giant. Afterwards was sent flying by a punch from Kokuryu. **Gaza Captain (ÊàëÂ∫ßC(„Ç¨„Ç∂„Ç≠„É£„Éó„ÉÜ„É≥))- Head of the Doros Ocean Primary School who resembles an AMX-003 Gaza-C from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. He smokes a corncob pipe and can transform into a shark-like combat form. His Death Army eye is disguised by a more classic Zeonic mono-eye design. He planned to convert living humans into brainless mechanical drones. While in disguise, he is also known for his occasional spoonerisms, saying things like Konasan, minnichiwa! (Evlo, helrybody!) **National Language Death Teacher (ÈÖ∑ÊÇüÂá∂Â∏´(„Ç≥„ÇØ„Ç¥„Éá„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„ÉÅ„É£-))- Resembles a MS-14 Gelgoog from Mobile Suit Gundam. He disguised himself as Eri during a test resit Kokuryu took, hoping to make him fail the test so he would be removed from the school and unable to further thwart the Death Teacher's plans. **Arithmetics Death Teacher (ÊÉ®Ë∂®Âá∂Â∏´(„Çµ„É≥„Çπ„Ç¶„Éá„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„ÉÅ„É£„Éº)) **Art Death Teacher (È†≠ËçíÂá∂Â∏´(„Ç∫„Ç≥„Ç¶„Éá„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„ÉÅ„É£-)) **Social Death Teacher (Â∞ÑÈ≠ÅÂá∂Â∏´(„Ç∑„É£„Ç´„Ç§„Éá„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„ÉÅ„É£-))- Three teachers who personally challenged Seirou in the frozen plains surrounding their school. Despite each utilising a group of Elite drones, Seirou hunted down and terminated all three of them one by one. *Elite(ÂÑ™Á≠âÁîü(„Åà„Çä„ÅÑ„Å®))- Drones built somewhat in Kokuryu's image. There are also cases of Elite Armour, which transform ordinary students into drones controlled by the Daibanchou. *Kyouji Saikyouin/Ankokuryuu Bancho- The 'Dark Dragon' bancho. A mysterious transfer student, Kyouji excels at all academic activities. Despite his small size he shows great strength. It is eventually revealed that he is a disguised dragon-like Banchou, linked to the Elite armours. Under his human guise, Kyouji convinces countless children to accept the intoxicating powers of the Elite armour to build an army. He attempted to use Tokyo Tower as a powerful transmitter to summon his converted horde but was stopped by an alliance of Kokuryu, Hakuou, Sekijishi and Seirou. Kyouji responded by using all the armour devices to create a gigantic body for himself, forcing his opponents to engage in Gigantic Musha Mode combinations to fight back. He eventually managed to reduce all four to their Banchou forms and continued to duel the much smaller Kokuryu. In the end, however, he realises what Kokuryuu is fighting for and changes sides, returning to Earth to start over. Kyouji enjoys milk, receiving a power boost from its consumption. ==Schools== *3rd Musha Elementary School - School attended by Kokuryu, Ryuunosuke and the Dom Alliance. A fairly average elementary school in which students are educated in such things as Musha Gundam history. *6th Northeast Circle Musha Primary School - A school surrounded by ice. *7th Private Musha Elementary School - School attended by Hakuou, Tomoe, Big Zami, the Hyaku-Shiki Squad and the Tears Of Time Group. *Doros Ocean Primary School - A school in a ship. At the beginning of the world, fishing and swimming in sea were banned, so the school's purpose remained a mystery. ==Collected volumes bonus content== The collected third and fourth volume present extra content that was not seen in the original Comic BomBom publishing. Volume three contains a trio of yonkomas focusing on: *Mama's affection for Kokuryu's chibi form *The Dom's rented accommodation *Tomoe's crush on Hakuou As the series was Ichishiki's final SD Gundam work, volume four presentes a bonus chapter in which Kokuryu encounters Mushamaru, Wakamaru, Bakimaru and Retsumaru, the leads of the three previous series penned by Ichishiki. ==Model kits== *BB #287- Kokuryu Gundam *BB #289- Hakuou Gundam *BB #291- Sekijishi Gundam *BB #292- Seirou Gundam The major gimmick for the model kits is their ability to combine into pre-designed forms. For example, both Kokuryu and Hakuou can transform into the legs or upper body of a larger Gundam design and combine together to create a completed Gundam model. However, playing into the popularity of SD Gundam customisation, the models also suggest various other ways to make a combination. These include: *Combining the most recently released kit with parts from at least three older kits (these kits are re- issued along with the original release of said Musha Banch≈ç F≈´unroku kit), an idea the manga further promotes with the concept that the Mobile Citizen characters are capable of turning SD Gundam model kit parts into usable upgrades for themselves. More specifically, later chapters of the manga show Kokuryu and Seirou Gundam specifically transforming into the multi-kit combiners shown on the packaging of their respective model kits. :Kokuryu Gundam- BB 156, BB 170, BB 194 :Hakuou Gundam- BB 171, BB 172, BB 192 :Sekijishi Gundam- BB 161, BB 164, BB 173 :Seirou Gundam- BB 93, BB 150, BB 178 :Additionally, the boxes for the Kokuryu Gundam and Hakuou Gundam kits suggest combining them with weapons from :Kokuryu Gundam- BB 127, BB 135, BB 162, BB 174 :Hakuou Gundam- BB 126, BB 127, BB 135, BB 162 *Buying two of a kit, transforming each one into the different combination segments and combining them together. By itself, each kit can form one of two forms- a smaller child form or a larger adult form. The child form makes use of a limited number of parts (usually at least the head and torso) whilst the adult forms use all of them. Kokuryu and Hakuou come with instructions for combining their left over parts into catapult-like weapons. In the manga, the Gundams upgrade themselves using cuts of a special scroll. A simulated length of this scroll was included with Hakuou Gundam's kit. Similarly, Sekijishi Gundam comes with a makeshift stand for his surfboard which is made from the smallest parts runner and a cardboard wave cut out from the side of the top lid of the box. After the release of BB #292 Seirou Gundam in August 2006 the line entered a hiatus with no further kits from the series produced. With the continuation of the manga and the recent unveiling of new forms for Kokuryu and Hakuou, it remains to be seen if any further kits shall be produced. The manga presents several kits that don't exist in reality, such as a High Grade Leo from Gundam Wing. Both Kokuryu and Hakuou can combine their forearm armour onto their forehead as a weapon. Notes on the instruction sheet for Kokuryu's model kit imply Ichishiki based the look on a large quiff, a hairstyle commonly associated with bancho culture in Japan. ==External links== Information links *Musha Banch≈ç dictionary (Japanese) Publisher links *Comic BomBom home page Musha Bancho Fuunroku Category:Martial arts anime and manga Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:School life in anime and manga Category:2006 manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Yonkoma ","title":"SD Gundam Musha Banch≈ç F≈´unroku"},{"id":"5564406","text":"The Pressure was an American band formed in September 1996. ==History== The band played their first show in San Diego. During their existence, the trio lived crammed together in a tiny studio apartment in Costa Mesa, California, with their cat. The band played live several times on college radio, as well as television, where they not only hosted the alternative rock program Are-Oh- Vee twice, but would appear on The Gong Show. The energy of their live shows guaranteed almost continual coverage in the Orange County Weekly, which voted them one of the top unsigned bands in October 1997. In April 1998, a cover story asked, \\"Are The Pressure OC's favorite band?\\". Their single, \\"I Wanna Call Someone\\" sold out of Orange County record stores the day it was released, and would wind up selling out completely in October 1998 after a deluge of European orders. Early in 1999, the band began working on their debut album with Alex Newport in San Francisco, a place where they had all originally lived. An appearance on the Vans Warped Tour 1999 that July, with Eminem, The Black Eyed Peas, NOFX and Pennywise in San Bernardino wound up being their last. The day their debut album Things Move Fast was released, drummer Jason Thornberry was found beaten nearly to death on the streets of Long Beach, and would remain in hospital for several months. The band didn't break up so much as break apart.

Dolna Banya is a resort town, known for its hot mineral waters, with temperatures of 56.3 C. The area surrounding the town is largely agricultural, and there are skiing and hiking trails in the nearby mountains. Dolna Banya is a small lively town. The square has a vegetable market, bakery, and two bars. The inside of the town's Bulgarian Orthodox church is covered in murals, and the churchyard located next to a stream. The local stadium is named Vasil Levski, a tribute to the leader of Bulgaria's liberation from the Ottoman Empire and the national stadium of the same name in Sofia. Dolna Banya is accessible by road, and a daily bus runs from the Sofia bus depot through other villages in the area. However, buses run more frequently from Sofia to Kostenets (8 km from Dolna Banya). From Kostenets transportation is available every 30 minutes to Dolna Banya. Trains also run about every hour between Sofia and Kostenets. In June 2005, Ibar Golf Club announced that a 20m Euro golf course would be constructed in Dolna Banya. Construction began in the fall of 2005 and is set for completion in 2007. It is expected to be the only golf course in Eastern Europe to meet PGA standards. ==Demography== According to the 2011 census, Dolna Banya has 4,522 inhabitants.  Ethnic groups  Most inhabitants are ethnic Bulgarians (81.7%), followed by a large Roma minority (17.6%).  Education  The city provides its inhabitants, and those of the surrounding villages, education through two municipal schools. Neofit Rilski is an elementary, middle and a high school that, as of 2019-20, has over 420 students. It was founded in 1851 with just a single class of students and a single teacher. The core of the current edifice was built in 1879, shortly after the Liberation of Bulgaria, and was later expanded as the number of classes grew. Hristo Botev is a vocational high school in Dolna Banya. As of 2019-20, the school has about 100 students.Th–µ school was founded in 1925, and currently offers courses related to the hospitality industry, as well as a woodworking and sewing courses. In Dolna Banya, there is also a kindergarten named after the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.  Religion  According to the latest Bulgarian census of 2011, the religious composition, among those who answered the optional question on religious identification, was the following: Most inhabitants belong to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (88%). There is also a very large Protestant minority (8%), especially part of the ethnic Roma people. There are two major temples in Dolna Banya - an Orthodox Christian church and an Evangelical church. ==Gallery== File:Dolna-Banya-from-Clock- Tower.jpgMain square - view from the town clock-tower File:Dolna-banya- municipality.jpgDolna Banya Municipality Hall File:Neofit Rislki School in summer, Dolna Banya.jpgNeofit Rilski School in summer, 2014.

According to his website, his father was Ali Mohammad, his grandfather was Mohammad Karim, his forefather was Mohammad Baqer and his progenitor was Mohammad Sadeq. According to Parvaneh Vahidmanesh, he has Jewish ancestors. He finished his school in Shiraz. He started his formal Islamic studies at the age of 14 in the Agha Babakhan Shirazi seminary. After completing the introductory studies, he started studying jurisprudence (fiqh) and its principles (usool al-fiqh). He made rapid progress and finished studying the complete levels of introductory and both the levels of the intermediate Islamic studies in approximately four years. During this time, he also taught at the Islamic seminary in Shiraz. At the age of 18, he formally entered the theological seminary of Qom, and for the next five years was present in the religious gatherings and classes of some of the leading Islamic teachers of those days, such as Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Burujerdi, & Ayatollah Seyyed Kazem Shariatmadari. In Najaf In 1950, he made his way to the seminary of Najaf, Iraq. Here, he was able to take part in classes of teachers such as Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim, Ayatollah Abul-Qassim Khoei and Ayatollah Abdul Hadi ash-Shirazi. At the age of 24, he was granted complete ijtihad by two senior scholars in Najaf. Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim also wrote a short, comprehensive letter of commendation for him. In 1951, he returned to Qom, since he did not have the means to survive and continue his studies in Najaf. After returning to Iran, Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi began teaching the intermediate and higher level of studies in usul al-fiqh and fiqh. Also, he was a member of the editorial board of the first Islamic magazine published in Iran named \\"Maktab'e Eslam\\", next to Ayatollah Shariatmadari. He has won the Iranian Royal Academy of Philosophy' award for his essay \\"Filsuf-Namaha\\". ==Fatwas (Rulings)== Makarem Shirazi in his office in 2016 Women's attendance in stadia In the aftermath of an attempt by President Ahmadinejad to allow women to attend soccer matches in stadiums (something they are not able to do now), Makarem issued a fatwa objecting to this. Alternatives to stoning Makarem's fatwa concerning stoning to death for adultery reads: \\"In certain circumstances, death by stoning can be replaced by other methods of punishment\\". Smoking Makarem issued a fatwa declaring smoking as forbidden (Haram). Dogs and pets In 2010, he responded to a request inquiring why a dog is considered unclean under shariah despite a lack of any references to dogs in the Quran. In his fatwa, he emphasized that under shariah, dogs are indeed considered unclean based upon riwayahs, reliable narrations (hadith) handed down from the Prophet Muhammad and his household. Makarem described the current Iranian inclination toward dogs as \\"blindly imitating the West\\"; something that he believes will result in \\"evil outcomes.\\" The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance of Iran reacted to this fatwa by banning all advertisement related to keeping, buying, and selling pets. Holocaust In September 2010, he was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as saying \\"The Holocaust is nothing but superstition, but Zionists say that people of the world should be forced to accept this. The truth about the Holocaust is not clear, and when the researchers want to examine whether it is true or the Jews have created it to pose as victims, they jail the researchers\\".http://www.france24.com/en/20100904-top-iran-cleric-rejects- holocaust-superstition Underage marriage In reference to marriage of girls under 13 years of age, which is allowed in Iran under certain circumstances, he has stated that, although such marriages were permitted in the past, in modern times it has been demonstrated that they are not in the best interest (maslahat) of the parties involved and should be considered invalid. ==Political career== Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi was active in the pre- revolution days, hence he was thrown in jail many times. He was even exiled on three separate occasions to three different locations-Chabahar, Mahabad and Anarak. After the Iranian revolution, he was appointed to the Assembly of Experts for construction and played a major role in writing the first constitution. He is no longer a member of the government, and resides in the city of Qom. On November 23, 2014 and after months of preparations, he finally managed to gather in over 600 religious scholars from around the world in a conference titled The International Congress on Extremist and Takfiri Movements in the Islamic Scholars‚Äô View. It was a meeting for discussing controversial issues effecting the Muslim world, especially Takfiri movements. After the first successful hosting in which he condemned the inaction in the face of ISIL atrocities, he decided to reorganize another conference, Extremism and Takfiri Movements in Today‚Äôs World on 28 January 2016, to further focus on the responsibilities of the Muslim scholars regarding the unwelcome emergence of extremism. At the second congress same as the first one, scholars of more than 80 countries received invitations and about one thousand people participated. ==Selected bibliography== Some of his publications include:\\" \\" * the Message of Quran * OUR BELIEF * Khums the Fund of Independence of Bait Al Mal * Quran Translation and Commentary in Brief * Life under the Grace of Ethics * Universal Government of Mahdi * Islamic Law * sexual problems of the youth * Shia Answers *Commentary on the book Kifayatul Usul (at age 18) *The Manifestation of Truth‚Äå *Commentary on the Quran (Tafsir Nemooneh) *The Message of the Quran *Anwar al-Fuqahah *al-Qawaidul Fiqhiyyah *The Limits of Azadari *They Will Ask You *50 Life Lessons from the Ahl al- Bayt (a) ==See also== * Grand Ayatollahs * List of current Maraji * Qom * Ijtihad * Marja == References External links== *Online Quran Project includes the Qur'an translation by Naser Makarem Shirazi. * His books online *His website *Biography Category:People from Shiraz Category:1927 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian grand ayatollahs Category:Iranian Holocaust deniers Category:Translators of the Quran into Persian Category:20th-century translators Category:Sex segregation and Islam Category:Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom members Category:Iranian people of Jewish descent Category:Muslims of Jewish descent Category:Members of the Assembly of Experts for Constitution Category:Grand ayatollahs ","title":"Naser Makarem Shirazi"},{"id":"5564449","text":"Uffenheim is a city in the Middle Franconian district of Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim, in Bavaria, Germany.

Flothow, directed B. Reeves Eason, and starring Tom Tyler in the title role. It is based on Lee Falk's comic strip The Phantom, first syndicated to newspapers in 1936 by King Features Syndicate. The serial also features Jeanne Bates as the Phantom's girlfriend Diana Palmer, and Ace the Wonder Dog as the Phantom's trusty German shepherd Devil (who is a wolf in the original comic strip). ==Plot summary== Professor Davidson plans an expedition to find the Lost City of Zoloz. The location of the city is contained on seven pieces of ivory, three of which Davidson already possesses. Doctor Bremmer, however, intends to find the lost city and use it as a secret airbase for his unnamed country. To remove him as an obstacle, he kills The Phantom, only for his recently returned son, Geoffrey Prescott, to inherit the family identity and take over the mantle of The Phantom. Three of the remaining ivory pieces are owned by Singapore Smith, who initially steals Davidson's pieces. The seventh, and most important, piece is missing at first but turns up in the possession of Tartar (which The Phantom acquires by wrestling Tartar's pet gorilla). ==Cast== * Tom Tyler as Godffrey Prescott/The Phantom * Jeanne Bates as Diana Palmer ==Production== Like most serials, The Phantom had a low budget. Most of the serial was filmed in the Hollywood hills, which doubled as the African jungle. For the serial, the Phantom's real name is Geoffrey Prescott. In the comic strip, his real name had not yet been introduced. The Phantom's real name was eventually introduced into the comic strip as Kit Walker. The Phantom tells Singapore Smith to call him \\"Walker\\" when he covers his costume with a hat, dark glasses, and an overcoat so he can enter civilization unobtrusively. ==Release== The serial was released as a double- disc DVD by VCI Video in 2001 (reusing the cover box art from their previous VHS release). It featured a commentary track by writer Max Allan Collins (for Chapter One only), as well as other special features, including actor bios, photo gallery, and comic book art gallery. In 2005 a different DVD edition was released exclusively in Australia. Its special feature is an hour-long conversation between Frew Publications editor-in-chief Jim Shepherd and film historian James Sherlock about the history of the Phantom comic and its various screen adaptations. This was dubbed over the first three chapters of the serial in place of a commentary track. Much of the dialogue of Chapter 11 had to be re-dubbed by new actors, because the original soundtrack-on-film negative had been damaged by the ravages of time. ==Critical reception== According to Jim Harmon and Donald F. Glut: \\"Unquestionably, The Phantom was one of Columbia's better serials...a task in casting, settings, and mood totally missing in such disasters as Batman from the same studio.\\" In a 2018 retrospective, Martin Pasko contended that \\"The Phantom has all the problems most serials - Columbia's in particular - did: an implausible script riddled with inane, unplayable dialogue; wretchedly wooden acting; and a budget that rendered ludicrous any attempt to stage believable, much less spectacular, action by today's standards.\\" Cline wrote that Tyler's characterization, in his last serial role, was more vivid than that in Adventures of Captain Marvel but slightly less memorable. He added that Tyler had an \\"almost uncanny\\" resemblance to the comic strip character. However, Pasko said that he \\"seems old beyond his years, and not at all the vigorous young man who could plausibly do what the script demands of him.\\" Harmon and Glut described him as wooden in his speech and movements, \\"the Gary Cooper of B films\\". Phantom creator Lee Falk disliked the serial, commenting that \\"It looks like it was shot in a phone booth.\\" ==Attempted sequel== In 1955 Columbia Pictures started filming a sequel to The Phantom, this time with John Hart in the lead role (Tom Tyler had died in 1954). The serial was well into production when producer Sam Katzman discovered that Columbia's rights to the character had expired, and owner King Features was unwilling to renew them. Katzman hastily transformed Return of the Phantom into The Adventures of Captain Africa.Comic Book Marketplace #121, May 2005, Gemstone Publishing. Despite the legal issues, The Adventures of Captain Africa incorporated a considerable amount of stock footage from the original Phantom series, including footage of Tyler in costume as the Phantom. ==Chapter titles== # The Sign of the Skull # The Man Who Never Dies # A Traitor's Code # The Seat of Judgment # The Ghost Who Walks # Jungle Whispers # The Mystery Well # In Quest of the Keys # The Fire Princess # The Chamber of Death # The Emerald Key # The Fangs of the Beast # The Road to Zoloz # The Lost City # Peace in the Jungle Source: ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1943 films Category:1940s adventure films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:The Phantom Category:American superhero films Category:Columbia Pictures film serials Category:Films based on comic strips Category:Films directed by B.

This is a type called a lead screw. A machine used in schools to demonstrate the action of a screw, from 1912. It consists of a threaded shaft through a threaded hole in a stationary mount. When the crank on the right is turned, the shaft moves horizontally through the hole. A screw is a mechanism that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. It is one of the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside. The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads on the inside of the hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft. Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. Like the other simple machines a screw can amplify force; a small rotational force (torque) on the shaft can exert a large axial force on a load. The smaller the pitch (the distance between the screw's threads), the greater the mechanical advantage (the ratio of output to input force). Screws are widely used in threaded fasteners to hold objects together, and in devices such as screw tops for containers, vises, screw jacks and screw presses. Other mechanisms that use the same principle, also called screws, don't necessarily have a shaft or threads. For example, a corkscrew is a helix-shaped rod with a sharp point, and an Archimedes' screw is a water pump that uses a rotating helical chamber to move water uphill. The common principle of all screws is that a rotating helix can cause linear motion. ==History== Wooden screw in ancient Roman olive press The screw was one of the last of the simple machines to be invented. It first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-609) BC, and then later appeared in Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Records indicate that the water screw, or screw pump, was first used in Ancient Egypt, some time before the Greek philosopher Archimedes described the Archimedes screw water pump around 234 BC. Archimedes wrote the earliest theoretical study of the screw as a machine, and is considered to have introduced the screw in Ancient Greece. By the first century BC, the screw was used in the form of the screw press and the Archimedes' screw. Greek philosophers defined the screw as one of the simple machines and could calculate its (ideal) mechanical advantage. For example, Heron of Alexandria (52 AD) listed the screw as one of the five mechanisms that could \\"set a load in motion\\", defined it as an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, and described its fabrication and uses, including describing a tap for cutting female screw threads.Bunch, Hellemans, 2004, p. 81 Because their complicated helical shape had to be laboriously cut by hand, screws were only used as linkages in a few machines in the ancient world. Screw fasteners only began to be used in the 15th century in clocks, after screw-cutting lathes were developed.Bunch, Hellemans, 2004, p. 80 The screw was also apparently applied to drilling and moving materials (besides water) around this time, when images of augers and drills began to appear in European paintings. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines, including the screw, was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in Le Meccaniche (\\"On Mechanics\\"). ==Lead and pitch== Lead and pitch are the same in single-start screws, but differ in multiple-start screws The fineness or coarseness of a screw's threads are defined by two closely related quantities: *The lead is defined as the axial distance (parallel to the screw's axis) the screw travels in one complete revolution (360¬∞) of the shaft. The lead determines the mechanical advantage of the screw; the smaller the lead, the higher the mechanical advantage. *The pitch is defined as the axial distance between the crests of adjacent threads. In most screws, called \\"single start\\" screws, which have a single helical thread wrapped around them, the lead and pitch are equal. They only differ in \\"multiple start\\" screws, which have several intertwined threads. In these screws the lead is equal to the pitch multiplied by the number of starts. Multiple-start screws are used when a large linear motion for a given rotation is desired, for example in screw caps on bottles, and ball point pens. ==Handedness== Right-hand and left-hand screw threads The helix of a screw's thread can twist in two possible directions, which is known as handedness. Most screw threads are oriented so that when seen from above, the screw shaft moves away from the viewer (the screw is tightened) when turned in a clockwise direction. This is known as a right- handed (RH) thread, because it follows the right hand grip rule: when the fingers of the right hand are curled around the shaft in the direction of rotation, the thumb will point in the direction of motion of the shaft. Threads oriented in the opposite direction are known as left-handed (LH). By common convention, right-handedness is the default handedness for screw threads. Therefore, most threaded parts and fasteners have right-handed threads. One explanation for why right-handed threads became standard is that for a right-handed person, tightening a right-handed screw with a screwdriver is easier than tightening a left-handed screw, because it uses the stronger supinator muscle of the arm rather than the weaker pronator muscle. Since most people are right-handed, right-handed threads became standard on threaded fasteners. Screw linkages in machines are exceptions; they can be right- or left-handed depending on which is more applicable. Left-handed screw threads are also used in some other applications: * Where the rotation of a shaft would cause a conventional right-handed nut to loosen rather than to tighten due to fretting induced precession. Examples include: **The left hand pedal on a bicycle. **The left-hand screw holding a circular saw blade or a bench grinder wheel on. * In some devices that have threads on either end, like turnbuckles and removable pipe segments. These parts have one right-handed and one left-handed thread, so that turning the piece tightens or loosens both threads at the same time. * In some gas supply connections to prevent dangerous misconnections. For example in gas welding the flammable gas supply line is attached with left-handed threads, so it will not be accidentally switched with the oxygen supply, which uses right-handed threads. * To make them useless to the public (thus discouraging theft), left-handed light bulbs are used in some railway and subway stations. * Coffin lids are said to have been traditionally held on with left-handed screws. ==Screw threads== Different shapes (profiles) of threads are used in screws employed for different purposes. Screw threads are standardized so that parts made by different manufacturers will mate correctly. Thread angle The thread angle is the included angle, measured at a section parallel to the axis, between the two bearing faces of the thread. The angle between the axial load force and the normal to the bearing surface is approximately equal to half the thread angle, so the thread angle has a great effect on the friction and efficiency of a screw, as well as the wear rate and the strength. The greater the thread angle, the greater the angle between the load vector and the surface normal, so the larger the normal force between the threads required to support a given load. Therefore, increasing the thread angle increases the friction and wear of a screw. The outward facing angled thread bearing surface, when acted on by the load force, also applies a radial (outward) force to the nut, causing tensile stress. This radial bursting force increases with increasing thread angle. If the tensile strength of the nut material is insufficient, an excessive load on a nut with a large thread angle can split the nut. The thread angle also has an effect on the strength of the threads; threads with a large angle have a wide root compared with their size and are stronger. Standard types of screw threads: (a) V, (b) American National, (c) British Standard, (d) Square, (e) Acme, (f) Buttress, (g) Knuckle Types of threads In threaded fasteners, large amounts of friction are acceptable and usually wanted, to prevent the fastener from unscrewing. So threads used in fasteners usually have a large 60¬∞ thread angle: *(a) V thread - These are used in self-tapping screws such as wood screws and sheet metal screws which require a sharp edge to cut a hole, and where additional friction is needed to make sure the screw remains motionless, such as in setscrews and adjustment screws, and where the joint must be fluid tight as in threaded pipe joints. *(b) American National - This has been replaced by the almost identical Unified Thread Standard. It has the same 60¬∞ thread angle as the V thread but is stronger because of the flat root. Used in bolts, nuts, and a wide variety of fasteners. *(c) Whitworth or British Standard - Very similar British standard replaced by the Unified Thread Standard. In machine linkages such as lead screws or jackscrews, in contrast, friction must be minimized. Therefore threads with smaller angles are used: *(d) Square thread - This is the strongest and lowest friction thread, with a 0¬∞ thread angle, and doesn't apply bursting force to the nut. However it is difficult to fabricate, requiring a single point cutting tool due to the need to undercut the edges. It is used in high-load applications such as jackscrews and lead screws but has been mostly replaced by the Acme thread. A modified square thread with a small 5¬∞ thread angle is sometimes used instead, which is cheaper to manufacture. *(e) Acme thread - With its 29¬∞ thread angle this has higher friction than the square thread, but is easier to manufacture and can be used with a split nut to adjust for wear. It is widely used in vises, C-clamps, valves, scissor jacks and lead screws in machines like lathes. *(f) Buttress thread - This is used in high-load applications in which the load force is applied in only one direction, such as screw jacks. With a 0¬∞ angle of the bearing surface it is as efficient as the square thread but stronger and easier to manufacture. *(g) Knuckle thread - Similar to a square thread in which the corners have been rounded to protect them from damage, also giving it higher friction. In low-strength applications it can be manufactured cheaply from sheet stock by rolling. It is used in light bulbs and sockets. *(h) Metric thread ==Uses== A screw conveyor uses a rotating helical screw blade to move bulk materials. *Because of its self-locking property (see below) the screw is widely used in threaded fasteners to hold objects or materials together: the wood screw, sheet metal screw, stud, and bolt and nut. *The self-locking property is also key to the screw's use in a wide range of other applications, such as the corkscrew, screw top container lid, threaded pipe joint, vise, C-clamp, and screw jack. *Screws are also used as linkages in machines to transfer power, in the worm gear, lead screw, ball screw, and roller screw. Due to their low efficiency, screw linkages are seldom used to carry high power, but are more often employed in low power, intermittent uses such as positioning actuators. *Rotating helical screw blades or chambers are used to move material in the Archimedes' screw, auger earth drill, and screw conveyor. *The micrometer uses a precision calibrated screw for measuring lengths with great accuracy. The screw propeller, although it shares the name screw, works on very different physical principles from the above types of screw, and the information in this article is not applicable to it. ==Distance moved== The linear distance d \\\\, a screw shaft moves when it is rotated through an angle of \\\\alpha \\\\, degrees is: :d = l \\\\frac { \\\\alpha }{360^\\\\circ} \\\\, where l \\\\, is the lead of the screw. The distance ratio of a simple machine is defined as the ratio of the distance the applied force moves to the distance the load moves. For a screw it is the ratio of the circular distance din a point on the edge of the shaft moves to the linear distance dout the shaft moves. If r is the radius of the shaft, in one turn a point on the screw's rim moves a distance of 2œÄr, while its shaft moves linearly by the lead distance l. So the distance ratio is :\\\\mbox{distance ratio} \\\\equiv \\\\frac {d_{in}} {d_{out}}= \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi r}{l} \\\\, ==Frictionless mechanical advantage== A screw jack. When a bar is inserted in the holes at top and turned it can raise a load The mechanical advantage MA of a screw is defined as the ratio of axial output force Fout applied by the shaft on a load to the rotational force Fin applied to the rim of the shaft to turn it. For a screw with no friction (also called an ideal screw), from conservation of energy the work done on the screw by the input force turning it is equal to the work done by the screw on the load force: :W_{in} = W_{out} \\\\, Work is equal to the force multiplied by the distance it acts, so the work done in one complete turn of the screw is W_{in} = 2 \\\\pi r F_{in} \\\\, and the work done on the load is W_{out} = l F_{out} \\\\,. So the ideal mechanical advantage of a screw is equal to the distance ratio: {F_{in}} = \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi r}{l} \\\\, }} It can be seen that the mechanical advantage of a screw depends on its lead, l \\\\,. The smaller the distance between its threads, the larger the mechanical advantage, and the larger the force the screw can exert for a given applied force. However most actual screws have large amounts of friction and their mechanical advantage is less than given by the above equation. Torque form The rotational force applied to the screw is actually a torque T_{in} = F_{in} r \\\\,. Because of this, the input force required to turn a screw depends on how far from the shaft it is applied; the farther from the shaft, the less force is needed to turn it. The force on a screw is not usually applied at the rim as assumed above. It is often applied by some form of lever; for example a bolt is turned by a wrench whose handle functions as a lever. The mechanical advantage in this case can be calculated by using the length of the lever arm for r in the above equation. This extraneous factor r can be removed from the above equation by writing it in terms of torque: :\\\\frac {F_{out}}{T_{in}} = \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi}{l} \\\\, ==Actual mechanical advantage and efficiency== Because of the large area of sliding contact between the moving and stationary threads, screws typically have large frictional energy losses. Even well-lubricated jack screws have efficiencies of only 15% - 20%, the rest of the work applied in turning them is lost to friction. When friction is included, the mechanical advantage is no longer equal to the distance ratio but also depends on the screw's efficiency. From conservation of energy, the work Win done on the screw by the input force turning it is equal to the sum of the work done moving the load Wout, and the work dissipated as heat by friction Wfric in the screw :W_{in} = W_{out} + W_{fric} \\\\, The efficiency Œ∑ is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 defined as the ratio of output work to input work :\\\\eta = W_{out} / W_{in} \\\\, :W_{out} = \\\\eta W_{in} \\\\, Work is defined as the force multiplied by the distance moved, so W_{in} = F_{in} d_{in} \\\\, and W_{out} = F_{out} d_{out} \\\\, and therefore :F_{out} d_{out} = \\\\eta F_{in} d_{in} \\\\, :\\\\frac {F_{out}}{F_{in}} = \\\\eta \\\\frac {d_{in}}{d_{out}} \\\\, {F_{in}} = \\\\eta \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi r}{l} \\\\, }} or in terms of torque :\\\\frac {F_{out}}{T_{in}} = \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi \\\\eta}{l} \\\\qquad \\\\, So the mechanical advantage of an actual screw is reduced from what it would be in an ideal, frictionless screw by the efficiency \\\\eta \\\\,. Because of their low efficiency, in powered machinery screws are not often used as linkages to transfer large amounts of power but are more often used in positioners that operate intermittently. ==Self-locking property== Large frictional forces cause most screws in practical use to be \\"self-locking\\", also called \\"non-reciprocal\\" or \\"non-overhauling\\". This means that applying a torque to the shaft will cause it to turn, but no amount of axial load force against the shaft will cause it to turn back the other way, even if the applied torque is zero. This is in contrast to some other simple machines which are \\"reciprocal\\" or \\"non locking\\" which means if the load force is great enough they will move backwards or \\"overhaul\\". Thus, the machine can be used in either direction. For example, in a lever, if the force on the load end is too large it will move backwards, doing work on the applied force. Most screws are designed to be self-locking, and in the absence of torque on the shaft will stay at whatever position they are left. However, some screw mechanisms with a large enough pitch and good lubrication are not self-locking and will overhaul, and a very few, such as a push drill, use the screw in this \\"backwards\\" sense, applying axial force to the shaft to turn the screw. push drill, one of the very few mechanisms that use a screw in the \\"backwards\\" sense, to convert linear motion to rotational motion. It has helical screw threads with a very large pitch along the central shaft. When the handle is pushed down, the shaft slides into pawls in the tubular stem, turning the bit. Most screws are \\"self locking\\" and axial force on the shaft will not turn the screw. This self-locking property is one reason for the very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal screws, studs and bolts. Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks. A heavy object can be raised by turning the jack shaft, but when the shaft is released it will stay at whatever height it is raised to. A screw will be self-locking if and only if its efficiency \\\\eta \\\\, is below 50%. :\\\\eta = \\\\frac {F_{out}/F_{in}}{d_{in}/d_{out}} = \\\\frac {F_{out}}{F_{in}} \\\\frac {l} {2 \\\\pi r} < 0.50 \\\\, Whether a screw is self-locking ultimately depends on the pitch angle and the coefficient of friction of the threads; very well- lubricated, low friction threads with a large enough pitch may \\"overhaul\\". ==References== Category:Simple machines Category:Egyptian inventions de:Gewinde ","title":"Screw (simple machine)"},{"id":"5564511","text":"The Open Unified Process (OpenUP) is a part of the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF), an open source process framework developed within the Eclipse Foundation.

He is known for his furnishings in the Baroque style and devotional sculptures. ==Biography== He was trained in a vigorous local tradition of sculpture in his native Belluno, in the Venetian terraferma, and in the studio of the Genoese sculptor Filippo Parodi, who was carrying out commissions at Padua and at Venice (1677). He spent the years 1678-80 at Rome, where the High Baroque sculpture of Bernini and his contemporaries polished his style. Apart from that, the first phase of Brustolon's working career was spent in Venice, 1680-1685\\\\. Brustolon is documented at several Venetian churches where he executed decorative carving in such profusion that he must have quickly assembled a large studio of assistants. As with his contemporary in London, Grinling Gibbons almost all the high quality robust Baroque carving in Venice has been attributed to Brustolon at one time or another. In the Venetian Ghetto, at the Scola Levantina,\\"Scola Levantina and Scola Luzzatto\\" Save Venice Inc Brustolon provided the woodwork for the synagogue on the piano nobile, where the carved, canopied bimah is supported on Solomonic columns, which Brustolon had seen in Bernini's baldacchino in the Basilica of St Peter's. cordovan), National Museum in Warsaw. Candelabra in San Trovaso Venice His furniture included armchairs with figural sculptures that take the place of front legs and armrest supports, inspired by his experience of Bernini's Cathedra Petri. The gueridon, a tall stand for a candelabrum, offered Brustolon unhampered possibilities for variations of the idea of a caryatid or atlas: the familiar Baroque painted and ebonized blackamoor gueridons, endlessly reproduced since the eighteenth century, found their models in Brustolon's work. His secular commissions from Pietro Venier, of the Venier di San Vio family (a suite of forty sculptural pieces that can be seen in the Sala di Brustolon of the Ca' Rezzonico, Venice), from the Pisani of Str√†, and from the Correr di San Simeone families encourage the attribution to him of some extravagantly rich undocumented moveable furniture. Andrea Brustolon's elaborate carved furniture aspired towards the condition of sculpture, such as the Dutch bases for console tables which look like enlargements of the work of the two Van Vianens, Paulus and Adam, perhaps the greatest Dutch silversmiths of the period. These carved pieces display the baroque tendency to develop a form three-dimensionally in space. Brustolon's walnut, boxwood and ebony pieces transcend ordinary functional limitations of furniture; they are constructed of elaborately carved figures. The framework of Brustolon's chairs, side tables and gueridons were carved as gnarled tree branches, with further supports of putti and moors carved in ebony. Backrests of the chairs, which were never touched in the rigidly upright posture that contemporary etiquette demanded, were carved with allegories of vanity, fire and music, etc. The most extravagant piece delivered for Pietro Venier was a large side table and vase-stand of box and ebony, designed as a single ensemble to display rare imported Japanese porcelain vases. The eclectic allegories include Hercules with the Hydra and Cerberus, moors and reclining river-gods (see ref.). For the Correr, less extrovert chairs bear female nudes extended along the armrests. For the Pisani, he carved a suite of twelve chairs (now at the Palazzo Quirinale) with flowers, fruit, leaves and branches to symbolize the twelve months of the year. Work by Brustolon is at the Villa Pisani at Stra. In 1685 Brustolon returned to the house where he was born at Belluno, and from that time devoted himself mainly to tabernacles and devotional sculptures in walnut, boxwood or ivory. His polychromed ivory Corpus from a crucifix is in the Museo Civico di Belluno,A comparable boxwood corpus on an ebonized crucifix, formerly belonging to Bonaventura Barberini, bishop of Ferrara in the Museum of the Capuchin Fathers of San Giuseppe in Bologna, was attributed to Brustolon in 2002: which preserves some of Brustolon's preparatory drawings for frames to be carved with putti displaying emblems. A pair of boxwood sculptures, The Sacrifice of Abraham and Jacob Wrestling with the Angel, integral with scrolling barocchetto stands, were in the collection of Justus Liebig (Liebigshaus, Frankfort). An altarpiece, c. 1720, is at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He died in Belluno in 1732. Brustolon had many imitators working in his style, both contemporary, and later. The Venetian sculptor Valentino Panciera Besarel (1829-1902) made upholstered armchairs in the Brustolon manner from the 1860s.Besarel, whose bust of Brustolon (1894) is at the Museo Correr, was himself commemorated in an exhibition in Verona, 2002 (exhibition catalogue by Massimo de Grassi, Valentino Panciera Besarel, Verona, 2002) and was the subject of a monograph, Giovanni Angelini, Gli Scultori Panciera Besarel (Belluno 2002). ==References== *Biasuz G., and Buttignon M.

Plants are able to absorb essential elements through their leaves. The absorption takes place through their stomata and also through their epidermis. Transport is usually faster through the stomata, but total absorption may be as great through the epidermis. Plants are also able to absorb nutrients through their bark. Foliar feeding was earlier thought to damage tomatoes, but has become standard practice. == Ocean-based sources == A popular version of the feeding is to use sea-based plant mixes, especially kelp, which contains many of the fifty \\"trace nutrients\\"; the more such nutrients are needed, the harder it is to balance them within the soil. Kelp also contains some hormones considered good for the development of the plants' leaves, flowers and fruit, of interest to organic gardeners who reject artificial hormone applications. == Effectiveness == H.B. Tukey was head of Michigan State University (MSU) Department of Horticulture in the 1950s. Working with S. H. Wittwer, they proved conclusively that foliar feeding is effective. Radioactive phosphorus and potassium were applied to foliage.Tukey, H.B., Ticknor, R.L., Hinsvark, O.N and Wittwer, S.H. (1952). Science, 116: 167‚Äì167. A Geiger counter was used to observe absorption, movement and nutrient utilization. The nutrients were transported at the rate of about one foot per hour to all parts of the plants. A spray enhancer can help nutrients stick to the leaf and then penetrate the leaves' cuticle. Foliar application has been shown to avoid the problem of leaching-out in soils and prompts a quick reaction in the plant. Foliar application of phosphorus, zinc and iron brings the greatest benefit in comparison with addition to soil where phosphorus becomes fixed in a form inaccessible to the plant and where zinc and iron are less available. == Use == Foliar feeding is generally done in the early morning or late evening, preferably at temperatures below , because heat causes the pores on some species' leaves to close. == Notes  Bibliography == * Peter Donelan.

He was also known as a collector of paintings, including several works by James McNeill Whistler. Born at the Hague, son of Captain John Day and his wife Emilie (n√©e Hartsinck), Day completed his schooling at Downside, and, as the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were at that time inaccessible to Catholics, obtained his BA from the University of London in November 1845. He was admitted as a student in the Middle Temple in 1845, was called to the Bar, and became a judge in June 1882. He was well known for sentencing criminals to lashes. In his latter years, he would sometimes listen to cases with his eyes closed, listening intently, and opening an eye suddenly if something significant were said. Colleagues jocularly referred to this as \\"the peep of Day\\". He was one of the judges who sat on the Parnell Commission. At the time it was said that it was on his insistence that early proof was tendered of the authenticity of the letters attributed to Parnell, which forced Richard Pigott into the witness box and led to the collapse of that part of the case. He retired from the High Court of Justice in 1901, when he was granted an annuity of ¬£3,500. In March the following year he was appointed to the Privy council. There are various portraits of Sir John Day. One of the most notable is a very large painting that is on display in the Royal Courts of Justice in London of several judges including Sir John Day.

The WWA was affiliated with the larger American Wrestling Association and recognized its champions, though the WWA also had its own champions. The WWA also recognized the championships of the Indianapolis-based Powerful Women of Wrestling promotion as their women's champions in the late 1980s. ==History== The World Wrestling Association (WWA), operating under the legal name Championship Wrestling of Indiana, Inc., was established in 1964 by Dick Afflis and Wilbur Snyder. The duo purchased the Indianapolis NWA promotion in 1964 from its longtime owner Jim Barnett, who at that time was attempting to start up a promotion in Australia. The name of the promotion was taken from the former promotions in the Chicago and Los Angeles areas. In 1965, the WWA purchased the Chicago-based Fred Kohler Enterprises from Fred Kohler. In May of the same year, the promotion ceased promoting events in Detroit. The promotion developed wrestlers such as Bobby Heenan and amateur wrestler Greg Wojciechowski. Wojciechowski wrestled for the WWA under the name \\"The Great Wojo\\" and held the WWA World Heavyweight Championship three times. In later years, Scott Steiner got his start in the WWA under his real name, Scott Rechsteiner. A talent sharing agreement with American Wrestling Association (AWA) head (and longtime champion) Verne Gagne brought forth other talent, including The Crusher and Baron von Raschke. The WWA also put on joint wrestling events with the AWA starting in 1966. In 1971, the WWA returned to promoting events in Detroit in competition with NWA Detroit until 1975. The WWA tried to make a go of it in the mid-1980s, when Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF) was buying regional promotions across the country, but the Bruiser's advancing age and the talent drain to the WWF was too much and the WWA ceased promoting matches in 1989. ==Championships== * WWA World Heavyweight Championship * WWA World Tag Team Championship ==Alumni== Male wrestlers { class=\\"pretty sortable \\" style=\\"font-size:85%; text-align:center; width:70%;\\" - !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Birth name: !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Ring name(s): !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Tenure: !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Notes -  The Cuban Assassin sort1979  -  Leroy Redbone sort1983‚Äì1984  -  Dick the Bruiser sort1964‚Äì1984  -  Mitsu Arakawa sort1964, 1966‚Äì1967, 1969‚Äì1970, 1972‚Äì1975  -  The Mongol sort1964‚Äì1965  -  Mike Kelly sort1972, 1981‚Äì1982  -  Pat Kelly sort1972, 1981‚Äì1982  -  Chico Garcia sort1973  -  Tony Romano sort1974  -  Igor Volkoff / Yugo Babich sort1965, 1975  -  Black Bart sort1965  -  Ox Baker sort1974‚Äì1979  -  Marcel Semard sort1964  -  Red Bastien sort1970  -  Sgt.

Constructed in 1948, they were the heart of a once-flourishing, streetcar suburban neighborhood known as simply \\"The Meadows\\". Today, as of 2006, The Meadows is the most blighted neighborhood in Indianapolis and suffers from very severe urban decay and blight. All but seven of the original twenty-two buildings remain standing. The area has suffered from extraordinarily high crime, including (at one point in time) having the reputation of being the city's worst neighborhood. Several efforts have been made in turning the area in the right direction, starting with several federal grants, and the demolition of Parkwood Projects, formerly situated to the east of Mozel Sanders. The entire neighborhood is slated for demolition, and a new, urban renewal type of neighborhood will replace it, which will be similar in nature to Fall Creek Place, also in Indianapolis.

The CIM has been called an outcome-based education diploma as it would be necessary to either receive or replace the high school diploma, and was characteristic of education reform legislation in many states such as Washington and Oregon. The report called for the nation's workforce for the challenges of a new world economic order. The Report of the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce was published in June 1990 by the National Center on Education and the Economy (NCEE), led by Marc Tucker. This document was the basis for the education reform laws, standards and assessment systems created by many states and the federal government in the 1990s in the United States. It codified the principles of outcomes-based education reform, which later became standards-based education reform. == Recommendations == From the report: > A new educational performance standard should be set for all students, to be > met by age sixteen. This standard should be established nationally and > benchmarked to the highest in the world. Students passing a series of > performance- based assessments that incorporate the standard would be > awarded a Certificate of Initial Mastery. This certificate would qualify the > student to choose among going to work, entering a college preparatory > program, or studying for a Technical and Professional Certificate, which > would be explicitly tied to advanced job requirements. These standards would > not be intended as sorting mechanisms, but would allow multiple > opportunities for success; the goal would simply be to ensure achievement of > high performance standards for the great majority of the nation's workforce. == Legacy == The NCEE eventually signed contracts with districts and states covering over half of public school children, including WASL and MCAS. == Abandonment == The formal terms and contractual agreements have been abandoned as no states or districts are still contracted to the NCEE, and legislation in states such as Washington have discarded the term \\"Certificate of Initial Mastery\\" or its minor variations. They have been effectively replaced by the No Child Left Behind, and tying the high school diploma to standards based test inspired by outcome-based education. Passing a test at the age of 16 was patterned after the European practice of ending the education of the non- college bound at 16 followed by an apprenticeship period, and this is why all states are using tests given at the 10th grade, even though US high schools don't graduate until the end of 12th grade. == The New Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce == The NCEE published a new study in December 2006, also co-authored by Marc Tucker which is essentially an updated version of the America's Choice report.

The more of this waste material that can be removed from coal, the lower its total ash content, the greater its market value and the lower its transportation costs. == Run-of-mine (ROM) coal == The coal delivered from the mine that reports to the coal preparation plant is called run-of-mine, or ROM, coal. This is the raw material for the CPP, and consists of coal, rocks, middlings, minerals and contamination. Contamination is usually introduced by the mining process and may include machine parts, used consumables and parts of ground engaging tools. ROM coal can have a large variability of moisture and maximum particle size. == Handling == Coal stockpile Coal stacker Coal reclaimer Coal needs to be stored at various stages of the preparation process, and conveyed around the CPP facilities. Coal handling is part of the larger field of bulk material handling, and is a complex and vital part of the CPP. Stockpiles provide surge capacity to various parts of the CPP. ROM coal is delivered with large variations in production rate of tonnes per hour (tph). A ROM stockpile is used to allow the washplant to be fed coal at lower, constant rate. A simple stockpile is formed by machinery dumping coal into a pile, either from dump trucks, pushed into heaps with bulldozers or from conveyor booms. More controlled stockpiles are formed using stackers to form piles along the length of a conveyor, and reclaimers to retrieve the coal when required for product loading, etc. Taller and wider stockpiles reduce the land area required to store a set tonnage of coal. Larger coal stockpiles have a reduced rate of heat loss, leading to a higher risk of spontaneous combustion. Travelling, luffing boom stackers that straddle a feed conveyor are commonly used to create coal stockpiles. Tunnel conveyors can be fed by a continuous slot hopper or bunker beneath the stockpile to reclaim material. Front-end loaders and bulldozers can be used to push the coal into feeders. Sometimes front-end loaders are the only means of reclaiming coal from the stockpile. This has a low up-front capital cost, but much higher operating costs, measured in dollars per tonne handled. High- capacity stockpiles are commonly reclaimed using bucket-wheel reclaimers. These can achieve very high rates. == Sampling == Sampling of coal is an important part of the process control in the A grab sample is a one-off sample of the coal at a point in the process stream, and tends not to be very representative. A routine sample is taken at a set frequency, either over a period of time or per shipment. Coal sampling consists of several types of sampling devices. A \\"cross cut\\" sampler mimics the \\"stop belt\\" sampling method specified by a standard originally published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). A cross cut sampler mounts directly on top of the conveyor belt, the falling stream sampler is placed at the head section of the belt. There are several points in the wash plant that many coal operations choose to sample. The raw coal, before it enters the plant. The refuse, to see what the plant missed. Then the clean coal, to see exactly what is being shipped. The sampler is set according to Tons per hour, Feet per minute and top size of the product on the actual belt. A sample is taken then crushed, then sub sampled and returned to the main belt. The sample is sent to an Independent lab for testing where the results will be shared with the buyer as well as the supplier. The buyer in many cases will also sample the coal again once it is received to \\"double check\\" the results. Continuous measurement of ash, moisture, kCal (BTU), sulfur Fe, Ca, Na, and other element constituents of the coal are reported by cross belt elemental analyzers. This information can be calibrated periodically to the lab data per methods. == Washability == The washability characteristics of a coal reserve are provided by obtaining liberation data on the raw coal sample. Liberation refers to the amount of physical breakage required to liberate coal from different other material densities. Low density material is clean coal whereas high density material is reject (rock). The intermediate density material is called middlings. Liberation data is commonly obtained by float and sink analysis. The procedures for this analysis are detailed in Australian Standard AS 4156.1 ‚Äì 1994 \\"Coal preparation ‚Äî Higher rank coal ‚Äî Float and sink testing\\". == Crushing == Coal crusher plant Crushing reduces the overall topsize of the ROM coal so that it can be more easily handled and processed within the CPP. Crushing requirements are an important part of CPP design and there are a number of different types. == Screening == Screens in screening plant are used to group process particles into ranges by size. Dewatering screens are used to remove surface water from the product. Screens can be static, mechanically vibrated or electro-mechanically vibrated. Screen decks can be made from different materials such as spring steel, stainless steel, mild steel or polyurethane (PU). == Gravity separation == Gravity separation methods make use of the different relative densities of different grades of coal, and the reject material.  Jigs  Jigs are a gravity separation method for coarse coal. Different types of wet jig include: * Baum Jig * Side pulsated Jig * Batac Jig * Under-air jig  Dense medium process  Dense medium gravity separation methods use a material such as magnetite to form a medium denser than water to assist in separation.  Dense medium baths (DMBs)  Different types of DMB include: * Teska bath * Daniels bath * Leebar bath * Tromp shallow bath * Drewboy bath * Barvoys bath * Chance cone * Wemco drums  Dense medium cyclones  A cyclone is a conical vessel in which coal along with finely ground magnetite (media) is pumped tangentially to a tapered inlet and short cylindrical section at a predetermined flowrate and pressure followed by a conical section where the separation takes place. The higher specific gravity fractions being subject to greater centrifugal forces pull away from the central core and descend downwards towards the apex along the wall of cyclone body and pass out as rejects/middlings through the underflow orifice discharge, also known as the spigot. The lighter particles are caught in an upward stream and pass out as clean coal through the cyclone overflow outlet via the vortex finder. From the overflow orifice, the coal goes into the overflow chamber, and is discharged to the next stage of the process. Fluid on entry commences in the outer regions of the cyclone body. This combined with rotational motion to which it is constrained creates an outer spiral. The existence of a top central outlet and inability for all the fluid to leave at the cone apex outlet, assist the inward migration of some of the fluid from the external moving mass. The amount of inward migration increases as the apex is neared, i.e. the radius decreased and the fluid which flows in this migratory stream, ultimately reverses its vertical velocity direction and flows upward to the cyclone over flow outlet, i.e. vortex finder. Since it is at the same time rotating, the result is an inner spiral. The Heavy Media Cyclone may be lined with very high quality ceramic tiles or manufactured from Ni-hard (a very hard alloy of cast iron containing nickel) with a specially designed helical profile. A cyclone is the heart of the washing unit in a Heavy Media Washery. It is a non moving part and hence requires very low maintenance. However, the pressure at the inlet of the cyclone is a very important factor and it is suggested to maintain a minimum pressure of around D x 9 x 9.81 x density/100 (in bars), where D = the inner diameter of the cyclone in mm. It is important to note that the pressure at which pulp (mixture of coal and magnetite) is introduced in the cyclone is the principal means of controlling the forces within the cyclone. With the decrease in pressure more coal shall report to the discard/middlings, thus impairing the efficiency of separation. If due to some reason the cyclone feed pump is not being able to deliver the required pressure at the inlet of the cyclone, feed should immediately be stopped and the pipelines, tank and pump should be properly checked for any jamming and any jamming should be properly cleaned before starting the circuit or the feed. == Fine coal methods == Fine coal is cleaned using froth flotation methods. Denver cells and Jameson Cells are two flotation methods used. Spirals perform a simple, low cost and reasonably efficient separation of finer sized material, based on particle density and size. == Dewatering == Dorr thickener Water is removed from the product to reduce the mass, and runoff on the stockpile. Different methods of dewatering exist, including: Coarse coal dewatering: * Coarse coal centrifuges * Screen bowl centrifuges * Slurry screens Fine coal dewatering: * Dewatering cyclones * Horizontal belt filters * Belt press Water is removed from tailings to recycle water. Filters, centrifuges and thickeners are used in this part of the process. The blackwater is a form of tailings. It is produced as a by- product is typically placed in a coal slurry impoundment, which can be sources of environmental disasters. Thickeners are used for dewatering slurries of either tailings or product. A thickener is a large circular tank that is used to settle out the solid material from the water in the feed slurry. The separated water is clarified and reused as process water in the CPP. Thickeners are sized according to the volume of feed slurry to be processed. Typical size ranges are from 13 to 40m in diameter and 3-4m high.Stuart Nicol, The Principles of Coal Preparation, 1997, p.275 The floor of the thickener is conical, sloping gently down toward the centre. The feed is pumped into the feedwell, at the centre of the thickener, near the top. The feed is normally dosed with flocculant before delivery to the thickener. The thickened mass is moved toward the bottom centre of the thickener by large rakes that rotate around the tank. Rotation speed is very slow, and drive torques can be high, especially for larger diameter thickeners. Drive torque is usually monitored continuously, as high densities could cause failure of the rakes and drive equipment. Rakes may have the capacity to be raised to reduce drive torque. The thickened slurry, also called thickener underflow, is pumped out of the bottom of the thickener. In the case of product coal, further dewatering is usually required before shipment. Thickened tailings can be pumped to a tailings dam, combined with larger sized rejects for disposal (co-disposal), or dewatered further before disposal. == Control and instrumentation == Control and instrumentation is a very important part of a CPP. Measurement of flow, density, levels, ash and moisture are inputs to the control system. PLCs are used extensively in plant design. SCADA systems are typically used to control the process. Other instrumentation found in plants include density gauges and online elemental coal analyzers. == See also == * Blackwater (coal) * Coal breaker == References  External links == * South African Coal Preparation Society * Australian Coal Preparation Society * China Coal Research Institute Coal Preparation Branch * Italian Coal Mining Society Category:Coal mining ","title":"Coal preparation plant"},{"id":"5564682","text":"Ramgoolam may refer to: ==People== *Navin Ramgoolam, former Prime Minister of Mauritius *Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, former Prime Minister and former Governor General of Mauritius ==Other== *Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport ","title":"Ramgoolam"},{"id":"5564708","text":"Bearley railway station serves the village of Bearley in South Warwickshire, England.

They moved inland to avoid enslavement by the Spaniards, while their numbers were drastically affected by colonial warfare, as were their neighbours, the Quiriquire and the Jirajara. The Caquet√≠os were also present in Aruba, Cura√ßao and Bonaire when these islands were first colonized by Alonso de Ojeda in 1499. The occupants of this region were known as Caquet√≠os by the Spaniards and their language (Caquet√≠o) belongs to the Arawakan family of languages. The Caquet√≠o and the Jirajara spoke the same language, and their cultures were quite similar. The Arawakan or Caquet√≠o language is termed a \\"ghost\\" language because virtually no trace of it survives. Only the name remains, saved in 17th-century texts.¬´Caquet√≠o¬ª Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Statue of cacique Manaure (chief of the Caquetios) at Plaza Manaure in Coro, Venezuela. ==Aruba, Cura√ßao and Bonaire== When the Spanish arrived in Aruba around 1500 they found the Caiquetios in Aruba, living much as they did in the Stone Age. The Caiquetios had probably migrated to Aruba, Cura√ßao and Bonaire in canoes made from hollowed out logs they used for fishing. Such crossings from the Paraguana peninsula in Venezuela, across the 17 miles of open sea to Aruba, would be possible in the canoes the Caiquetios of Venezuela built.  Spanish period  During the first years of colonization, the natives of Aruba were described by the Spaniards as Caquet√≠os. In addition, the Caquet√≠os in the mainland were the tribe geographically closest to Aruba, and archaeological evidence points towards close ties between both groups during pre-Columbian times. Perhaps as many as 600 lived in Aruba at the time of the Spanish arrival in 1499. Together with Cura√ßao and Bonaire, Aruba was declared an island without use in 1513, and two years later some 2000 Caquet√≠os from the three islands combined were transported to Hispaniola to work in mines. These people presumably comprised the entire population of the islands, but 150 to 200 were returned to Aruba and Cura√ßao in 1526 to work on the exportation of brazilwood, kwihi, and divi-divi. The people returned to Aruba and Cura√ßao were mainly Caquet√≠os, but some Arawaks from other Caribbean islands were included in the group. Because of the complexity of the Aruba cave labyrinths, it is possible that they were mostly natives who had escaped deportation, but they could have been recent migrants from the mainland. In addition, substantial mainland-to-Aruba migrations of escapees occurred from 1529 to 1556, during the development of the Venezuelan colony (Haviser, 1991).  Dutch period  Aruba was neglected by the Spaniards from 1533 until the Dutch conquest of 1636, when Spanish and native languages (especially Caquet√≠o) were widely spoken. Upon the Dutch conquest the Spaniards fled, and the natives were deported to the mainland because they were regarded as sympathetic to the Spaniards. However, in that same year of 1636, the Dutch West Indian Company (WIC) assigned Aruba the duty of breeding horses and cattle, and natives were chosen for these endeavors because they had a good reputation as wild-horse hunters. Also, some in war with Spaniards west of Maracaibo fled to Aruba. The importance of Aruba diminished after the 1648 Peace Treaty between the Netherlands and Spain, and the island was neglected again. In 1655, the Dutch West Indian Company recognized free inhabitants of Aruba as trade partners. These people were assigned a piece of land on which to maintain themselves through cultivation; they also cut and sold wood and exploited marine resources. Alexandre Olivier Exquemelin, who wrote about his experiences as a buccaneer in the Caribbean, gives a description of the Aruban way of life during the second half of the 17th century. Exquemelin points out that the people spoke Spanish, were Catholic, and were visited frequently by Spanish priests from the mainland. As an example of their strong links with the mainland, some 200 residents agreed to leave Aruba in 1723 to raise the Venezuelan town of El Carrizal under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of the city of Coro. Dutch government records show that the last true native of Aruba died in Aruba around 1862. However, even today, recognisable features remain in the faces of many of the native Arubans.

It is capable of maintaining an internal ambient temperature below 38 degrees Celsius when functioning with Intel's Pentium 4 and Celeron D processors based on 90 nm process technology, and an ambient temperature below 39 degrees Celsius when using a Pentium D processor. Intel maintains that using a thermally advantaged chassis is the absolute minimum requirement for using Pentium 4 (Prescott), Pentium D, and Celeron D, processors. ==Overview== In the 1.1 version, the TAC design is intended to disallow internal temperature rises of more than 3 degrees Celsius, and provide the processor with a cooler environment to work in. Its main feature is a Chassis Air Guide that directs room temperature air directly in the path of the CPU fan and heat sink. The chassis air guide is a passive cooling system, and relies completely on internal system fans to guide the air. ==Airflow pattern== As with most computers, the rear fan and power supply fan exhaust, moving hot air away from the computer. This causes a slight depressurization inside the chassis, and requires all other openings to become intake vents. Airflow from the front of the chassis moves around the Chassis Air Guide, allowing the processor fan to only draw air from outside the chassis, providing more effective cooling. System fans The rear chassis exhaust fan is required to be at least 92-mm or larger, providing a minimum of 55 CFM in free air. The processor is required to have an active cooling system, consisting of a fan and heat sink.

Many administrators believe the level of violence, or the underlying threat of violence within prisons, is a chief factor causing the need for PC units. This factor was cited by Anderson (1980) and Vantour (1979), with the following broad elements noted as contributing to the problem. Prisoners have the opportunity to request protective custody if they get the impression that the environment they are living in is harmful to their well being. Their request may be granted if the officials rule that the prisoner is truly at risk. Protective custody might simply involve putting the person in a secure prison (if the threat is from the outside), but usually protective custody involves some degree of solitary confinement. For people who are threatened because of their association with a certain group or gang, moving them to another section of the prison may be sufficient. ==History of starting PC units== Early uses of protective custody started in the 1960s by law enforcement but it was used infrequently. Federal prosecution of organized crime figures led to the offering of witness protection to key government informers. In 1964 Joseph Valachi became the first La Cosa Nostra member to publicly testify to the existence of the organized crime group, appearing before a congressional committee. Valachi, who was facing the death penalty, agreed to testify in return for personal protection. He was held in solitary confinement for protection and given $15 a month. Since the 1970s the Federal Witness Security Program has grown in size. The program used to fight organized crime, terrorism, gang-related crime, and narcotics trafficking. In 1995, 141 new participants added to the program, increasing the number to 6,580 witnesses and 14,845 total participants since the program began. Also in 1995, 257 protected witnesses testified at trials against organized crime members, resulting in a substantial number of convictions. In return for assistance from these participants, the witness and family members over eighteen years of age must each sign a memorandum of agreement. The witness must agree to testify and provide information to law enforcement officials. In addition, the person must agree not to commit any crime and to take all necessary steps to avoid detection. Most witnesses remain in the program for two years before pursuing their new lives on their own.. Witness protection programs also exist in prisons. To protect witnesses serving a prison sentence, the federal government has created witness protection units within federal prisons. Protected witnesses live a more comfortable life than other prisoners, which includes having free and unlimited access to telephone and cable television and the ability to use their own money to buy food, appliances, jewelry, and other items. In a prison context, protective custody is used mainly in the following cases: *Those who are at high risk of being harmed or killed by other prisoners either for their crime or their group (ethnic or otherwise), such as pedophiles, child murderers / child abusers, rapists, men who commit violence against women, people who have committed hate crimes, people who have committed crimes against the elderly, animals, the disabled, the poor and the less fortunate, informants, gang members in a prison containing rival gang members or those who choose to \\"debrief\\" (provide information on their gang), or prisoners who are gay, transsexual, or transgender.Part four: The myth of \\"protective custody\\" ‚Äì (Originally from Arrested justice: When LGBT people land in jail, article series on gay.com) *Offenders with notorious criminal activities on the outside who may not be prison-wise or who may be subject to pressure because of their notoriety. *Those criminals who are themselves witnesses to a crime, and might be harmed by other prisoners to either prevent them from speaking out, or for revenge. *Inmates nearing expiration of their sentences who are trying to avoid disciplinary infractions or other problems. *Corrupt public servants, including police officers, civil servants, people convicted of spying, doctors, council officers, etc. *Celebrities convicted of serious offences. Visiting: *Space for family and attorney visits must be provided for PC cases, either in the PC unit or in the general population visiting room. *An inmate search area and separate inmate entry route should be incorporated into the unit design to ensure the safety of other inmates and visitors. Education, barbershop, laundry, and commissary: *Libraries should be provided for inmates to read, study, and research any of their interest. ==Other usages== Protective custody does not necessarily imply that the person is a prisoner or in a prison setting. In some usages, it might simply involve placing a person in a secure setting, with no implication of imprisonment, such as when a child is placed in temporary foster care.Emergency Protective Custody: Checklist for Law Enforcement Officers (from the Children's Law Center, South Carolina, website) In some cases, non-criminals (or defendants in pending trials) have also been placed in protective custody in a prison setting, for example to protect them from being lynched. ==References== Category:Imprisonment and detention ","title":"Protective custody"},{"id":"5564796","text":"Morus serrata, known as Himalayan mulberry, is a species of mulberry native to the Himalaya and the mountains of southwestern China, at altitudes of up to 2300 m.

Wallace's conviction was later overturned by the Court Of Criminal Appeal, the first instance in British legal history where an appeal had been allowed after re-examination of evidence. The case, with its strange background, has long been the subject of speculation and has generated many books, being regarded internationally as a classic murder mystery. ==Background== Prudential Assurance Building in Liverpool William Herbert Wallace was born in Millom, Cumberland, in 1878. He had a younger brother and sister. On leaving school at fourteen he began training as a draper's assistant in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. On finishing his apprenticeship he obtained a position in Manchester with Messrs Whiteway Laidlaw and Company, outfitters to the British Armed Forces and the Colonial, Indian and Diplomatic Services. In 1903, after five years' service, Wallace obtained a transfer to the company's branch in Calcutta, India, where he remained for two years. On the suggestion of his brother, Joseph, who lived in Shanghai, in 1905 Wallace sought another transfer to Whiteway Laidlaw's branch in that city. A recurrent kidney complaint resulted in Wallace resigning his position and returning to England in 1907, where his left kidney was removed at Guy's Hospital. Little is recorded of his life after this time, until he obtained a position working for the Liberal Party in Harrogate, rising to the post of election agent in 1911. During his time in Harrogate, he met Julia Dennis (28 April 1861 ‚Äì 20 January 1931), and they were married there in March 1914. All early sources suggested that Julia was approximately the same age as Wallace, but in 2001 James Murphy demonstrated from her original birth certificate that she was actually seventeen years older than he was. Julia's father was a ruined alcoholic farmer from near Northallerton. At the outbreak of the First World War, the position of Liberal election agent in Harrogate was discontinued, owing to the suspension of elections and a parliamentary truce, and Wallace once again found himself looking for a job. Through the help of his father, he obtained a position as collections agent with the Prudential Assurance Company in Liverpool. The Wallaces moved there in 1915, settling in the district of Anfield. During the 1920s, Wallace supplemented his comfortable but mundane existence as collections agent by lecturing part- time in chemistry at Liverpool Technical College. His hobbies included chemistry, botany, and chess, and he learned to play the violin to enable him to accompany Julia, who was an accomplished pianist, in \\"musical evenings\\" at their home at 29 Wolverton Street, Anfield. ==The crime== Wallace and his wife lived at 29, Wolverton St in Anfield. The row of buildings had been built in 1910. Wallace, aged 52, attended a meeting of the Liverpool Central Chess Club on the evening of Monday 19 January 1931,Murder in the 1930s p. 42 to play a scheduled chess game. While there he was handed a message, which had been received by telephone about 25 minutes before he arrived. It requested that he call at an address at 25 Menlove Gardens East,Murder in the 1930s p. 44 Liverpool, at 7.30pm the following evening to discuss insurance with a man who had given his name as \\"R.M. Qualtrough\\". The next night Wallace duly made his way by tramcar to the south of the city at the time requested, only to discover that while there were Menlove Gardens North, South and West, there was no East. Wallace made inquiries in a nearby newsagent's and also spoke to a policeman on his beat, but nobody he asked was able to help him in his search for the address or the mysterious Qualtrough. He also called at 25 Menlove Gardens West, and asked several other passers-by in the neighbourhood for directions, but to no avail. After searching the district for about 45 minutes, Wallace returned home.Murder in the 1930s pp. 43-44 Neighbours John and Florence Johnston were heading out for the evening when they encountered Wallace in the back alleyway, complaining that he could not gain entry to his home at either the front or the back. While they watched, Wallace tried the back door again, which now opened. Inside he found his wife Julia had been brutally beaten to death in their sitting room. ==The investigation== Up to his arrest two weeks later, Wallace made two voluntary statements but was never intensively questioned by the police although he was required to attend CID headquarters every day and was asked specific questions about whether the Wallaces had had a maid, why he had asked the man who had taken the telephone message at the chess club to be specific about the time he took it, and whether he had spoken to anyone in the street on his way back to his house from his abortive attempt to find Mr. Qualtrough. The police had evidence that the telephone box used by \\"Qualtrough\\" to make his call to the chess club was situated just 400 yards from Wallace's home, although the person in the caf√© who took the call was quite certain it was not Wallace on the other end of the line. Nevertheless, the police began to suspect that \\"Qualtrough\\" and Wallace were the same man. Wallace's legal team conducted timing tests that showed it was possible for someone to have made the call, catch a tram and arrive at the chess club when Wallace did, and it was equally possible for Wallace to arrive at the same time by boarding at the stop he claimed he had used, nowhere near the telephone box.Antony M Brown, Move to Murder, Mirror Books, , pp.183-186. The police were also convinced that it would have been possible for Wallace to murder his wife and still have time to arrive at the spot where he boarded his tram. This they attempted to prove by having a fit young detective go through the motions of the murder and then sprint all the way to the tram stop, something an ailing 52-year-old Wallace probably could not have accomplished. The original assessment of the time of death, around 8 pm, was also later changed to just after 6.30 pm, although there was no additional evidence on which to base the earlier timing. Forensic examination of the crime scene had revealed that Julia's attacker was likely to have been heavily contaminated with her blood, given the brutal and frenzied nature of the assault. Wallace's suit, which he had been wearing on the night of the murder, was examined closely but no trace of bloodstains were found. The police formed the theory that a mackintosh, which was inexplicably found under Julia's corpse, had been used by a naked Wallace to shield himself from blood spatter while committing the crime. Examination of the bath and drains revealed that they had not been recently used, and there was no trace of blood there either, apart from a single tiny clot in the toilet pan, the origin of which could not be established. ==Trial and appeal== Wallace consistently denied having anything to do with the crime, but was charged with murder and stood trial at Liverpool Assizes. After conducting a secret mock-trial in London, which unanimously found Wallace not guilty, the Prudential Staff Union, in a unique act, sponsored his defence. Despite the evidence against him being purely circumstantial, and the statement of a local milk delivery boy ‚Äî who was certain he had spoken to Julia only minutes before her husband would have had to leave to catch his tram ‚Äî Wallace was found guilty after an hour's deliberation by the Liverpool jury, and sentenced to death. F. J. Salfield, who was present in the courtroom, commented, \\"what probably harmed [Wallace] most at his trial was his extraordinary composure. Like every other observer, I found enigmatic his seeming indifference to his surroundings. Shock? Callousness? Stoicism? Confidence? We shall never know.\\" In an unprecedented move, in May 1931 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the verdict on the grounds that it was \\"not supported by the weight of the evidence\\", and Wallace was set free.Murder in the 1930s p. 51 The decision meant that the jury was wrong ‚Äî appeals are usually brought on the basis of bad decisions by the presiding judge at the original trial, or by the emergence of new evidence. After his successful appeal,(1931) 23 Cr App Rep 32 Wallace returned to his job in insurance but public opinion in the areas where he lived and worked was strongly of the view that he had been guilty and had 'got away with it'. Many of Wallace's previous customers shunned him; he was subjected to hate mail and physical threats and had to take a clerical job at his employer's head office. At the same time, he moved to a bungalow in Bromborough, Merseyside. On 26 February 1933, less than two years after the appeal, and still employed by Prudential, William Herbert Wallace died aged 54 from uraemia and pyelonephritis at Clatterbridge Hospital. The Wallaces' grave in Anfield Cemetery No other person was charged with the murder and it remains officially unsolved. A further mock-trial, conducted by the Merseyside Medico-Legal Society in 1977, presided over by Mr. Justice Lawson, also found Wallace not guilty. ==Richard Gordon Parry== In the 1960s, crime writer Jonathan Goodman made inquiries that led him to a junior employee at Prudential who had worked with Wallace. This man had done some of Wallace's collection work for him when the older man had been ill in 1928. Wallace had then had first-hand evidence that the younger man did not pay in all the premiums which he had collected. Yet for whatever reason, Wallace did not seem to have passed this information on to his employer. About a year later, the young man left Prudential to join another insurance firm. Wallace was later told that while this man had not been sacked he had left under something of a cloud, his father making up some of his son's shortfall. The young man was also acquainted with Julia. Goodman mentioned him, but not by name, in his book The Killing of Julia Wallace.Jonathan Goodman, The Killing of Julia Wallace, 1969, Harrap, , . Roger Wilkes, a BBC news editor, investigated the case for a radio programme to be broadcast on the 50th anniversary of the crime in early 1981. Wilkes learned that Goodman's suspect, a man named Richard Gordon Parry,born 12 January 1909 in Liverpool, died 14 April 1980 in Llangernyw, North Wales had given the police an alibi for the time of Julia's murder a woman to whom he was engaged. However, after Wallace's death and after being jilted by the suspect, the woman offered to swear to Wallace's solicitor that the alibi had been false. Wilkes also discovered that, on the night of the murder, Parry had visited a local garage where he'd used a high-pressure hose to wash down his car. A mechanic at the garage had noticed that one of his gloves was soaked in blood.Unsolved Murders and Mysteries, edited by John Canning, , ‚Äî Wallace story written by Colin Wilson. Wilkes attempted to track down Parry, only to learn he had died but a few months previously. In 1931, Parry was a spoilt young man of 22 who sustained a lavish lifestyle by spending recklessly. Wilkes claims that Parry knew that Wallace's insurance takings for the day would have been in a cash box at his home. Since he also personally knew Wallace's wife, it would have been no trouble to visit her on some pretext once Wallace had been lured out of the house by means of the phone call sending him to a non-existent address. Julia's murder for the insurance takings was somewhat in vain as there was very little in the cash box that day. Parry was visited by the police as part of their inquiries but was given a false alibi by his girlfriend. Wilkes went ahead and named Parry in his radio programme, and later spelled out his case in a book called Wallace: The Final Verdict.Wallace: The Final Verdict, 1984, by Roger Wilkes, Grafton, , The case against Parry is much stronger than that against Wallace, and ascribes a more convincing motive. There was witness evidence of a blood- stained glove found in Parry's car on the night of the murder, when he took his car to the garage for cleaning. The evidence from the man who cleaned the car was deliberately suppressed by the police at the time. Wilkes argues that there was, moreover, no motive or reason for Wallace to kill his own wife, and that he was charged because the immense publicity surrounding the case impelled the police to get a conviction at any cost. Parry died in 1980 without admitting any involvement in the crime. However, when Goodman and his friend Richard Whittington-Egan confronted him on his London doorstep in 1966, Parry displayed an astonishingly detailed knowledge of the case, and was aware of the deaths of several obscure witnesses connected with it. Parry may have been suspected long before Goodman or Wilkes began their investigations. In 1934 author Winifred Duke made oblique reference to the name of the killer as 'Harris', a common Welsh surname which is a cognate of Parry. Writing in the Sunday Times Magazine in October 2013, P.D. James refers to the conclusions of Goodman and Wilkes, but speculates that Parry made the \\"Qualtrough\\" call as a practical joke in retaliation for Wallace's having reported Parry to their employers for dishonesty. She concludes that Wallace did in fact murder his wife and speculates that the murder weapon was an iron poker with which Wallace struck his victim, having first stripped and covered himself with the mackintosh found at the scene, spattered with Julia's blood, and that it was entirely possible for him to have done so within a reconstructed timeline of the events of that evening. She believes that \\"in the end justice was done, if only the fallible justice of men\\". This reading of the evidence must, however, be set against the fact that Wallace probably never reported his experience of Parry's dishonesty to their mutual employer and that Parry was not formally dismissed either at the time, or later. There is no evidence that Wallace attempted to use this information to coerce or blackmail Parry. In 2017, Ann Carlton, in her book Penny Lane and All That: Memories of Liverpool,Ann Carlton, Penny Lane and All That, YLolfa, describes how her father‚Äîthe late Sir Stanley Holmes‚Äîvisited Wallace in his prison cell, at Wallace's request, after he had been convicted. Holmes was then a teenager working for Liverpool Corporation and was friendly with the sons of Wallace's regular chess opponent, a Mr Caird. According to Carlton, Holmes said that Wallace revealed the name of the man he thought was the murderer; it was a man who Holmes knew from Lister Drive School. Holmes stated the suspect was clever but a bad lot, and some years after the murder he had seen the suspect in the dock accused and convicted over a different matter. Speculating about Wallace's motives in asking to see her father, Carlton wrote that he may have suspected that the city's local government establishment wanted to protect the son and nephew of one of their own, and that the case against him was brought to do just that. She added that she believed that the young man her parents knew and thought was a bad lot - and very possibly a murderer ‚Äì was Parry. Author Antony M. Brown surveyed all the published theories, both evidentially and logically, in his 2018 book Move to Murder,Antony M Brown, Move to Murder, Mirror Books, before concluding that, on balance, a previously-unpublished theory \\"is the best explanation for one of the most puzzling murder cases in British criminal history.\\" The new theory, first posited in 2008 by Merseyside-based researcher Rod Stringer, holds that Parry was indeed the brains behind a robbery, which turned to murder when his unknown accomplice was confronted by Julia after rifling the cash box ‚Äì after first gaining entry to 29 Wolverton Street on the pretext he was ‚ÄúQualtrough‚Äù. ==See also== * Rex v Wallace * Miscarriages of justice * List of unsolved deaths ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Murder Most Mysterious (1932) by Hargrave Lee Adam, online copy at The Internet Archive *The Trial of William Herbert Wallace (1933) by W.

The family lived at Gargunnock in Stirlingshire. After Winchester College and New College, Oxford, Younger read for the Bar and was called (Inner Temple) in 1932. Two years later he married Elizabeth Stewart. They had two daughters and one son (Sam, who became a BBC executive, and is now Chief Executive of the Charity Commission). ==Entry into politics== During World War II, Younger served in the Intelligence Corps and rose to the rank of Major. At the end of December 1944 he was adopted as Labour candidate for Grimsby which was then held by Walter Womersley for the Conservatives with a small majority. In the 1945 general election Younger won easily. Philip Noel-Baker, who was Minister of State for Air, appointed Younger as his Parliamentary Private Secretary immediately after the election. This appointment did not stop Younger from trying to understand the lives of his constituents better: on 28 August 1945 he set sail on the steam trawler Marano from Grimsby as a 'spare hand' for an eight- or nine-day voyage to North Sea fishing grounds. ==Ministerial office== His experience in intelligence led him to be appointed as Chairman of the UNRRA Committee of Council on Europe on 6 June 1946. Later that year he was named as part of the British delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, and on his return he opened an exhibition of the United Nations to the International Association of Journalists, also speaking to public meetings about the work of the UN. He was also a member of the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedure. His abilities had caught the eye of Clement Attlee, and in a government reshuffle on 7 October 1947 he became Parliamentary Secretary to the Home Office. ==Foreign Office work== Following the 1950 general election, Younger was promoted to be Minister of State at the Foreign Office, the deputy to Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin. Following Bevin's illness in April 1950, Younger became Acting Foreign Secretary. He picked up on British attempts at diplomacy to try to bring the Communists who had taken control of China into the international community, attempts that did not meet with success, although the United Kingdom did recognise the Communists as having de jure control. Younger also led on developing British policy in relation to the European Coal and Steel Community when it was first proposed; the government had wanted to participate but was unable to accept proposals drafted by the French government and therefore did not join. At the time of the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, Bevin was ill and Younger played a central role in determining Britain's diplomatic reaction. Later that year he headed the British delegation to the UN General Assembly and introduced the British proposals for a negotiated ceasefire; he rejected Soviet proposals which contained a vague promise of 'free elections' in Korea but did not state how they were to be organised. Younger tried to assure the Chinese government that United Nations forces would not pursue the North Korean army further and attempt to invade China. In late October, he suggested the government of Czechoslovakia had been imposed on the country by the proximity of Soviet troops; this was angrily rejected by the delegate from that (former) country. ==In opposition== Younger was rated a success by Attlee but was not of sufficient stature to take over when Bevin finally moved from the Foreign Office due to ill health in March 1951. He was one of the more prominent Labour speakers in the 1951 general election campaign, and following the election was made a member of the Privy Council in Attlee's resignation honours list. As a moderate, Younger offered himself as a candidate for the Parliamentary Labour Party Parliamentary Committee (the \\"Shadow Cabinet\\") in the early 1950s and served as an opposition spokesman. In 1955 he was elected to the Shadow Cabinet and served under Attlee and Gaitskell as Shadow Home Secretary. ==Post-Parliamentary career== However, Younger soon lost interest in high-profile party politics and in 1957 he was defeated for the Shadow Cabinet. He was more interested in individual campaigns, becoming a member of the Homosexual Law Reform Society. He stood down from Parliament in 1959 (ceding his seat to Anthony Crosland, a fellow moderate). He became a Director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (better known as \\"Chatham House\\") and from 1960 to 1973 he was chairman of the Howard League for Penal Reform. Having experience in government, Younger was recruited to chair the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1966, and to chair the Committee of Inquiry on Privacy from 1970 to 1972, receiving the KBE as a reward. In 1976 he was made Chairman of the Data Protection Committee but died before the inquiry had concluded. He was also Chairman of the Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham Area Health Authority from 1974 to 1976. ==References== * \\"In the Midst of Events: Diaries and Papers of Kenneth G.

The housing consists mainly of American foursquare-type homes and bungalows built in the 1910s to 1920s. Seventy-five percent of the homes in the area were built before 1939. UNWA Narrative History. Riverside is named for its location beside the White River. ==Overview== The boundaries of Riverside are 30th Street on the north, Fall Creek to the south, the Indiana Central Canal to the east, and the White River to the west. Riverside Neighborhood Association. Many of the neighborhood's focus areas are situated along Harding Street. ==History== Riverside is a diverse community that has undergone several cycles of change since its founding. As a result, a number of attempts have been made to revitalize the neighborhood in recent years. The neighborhood association is Riverside Civic League (RCL) and it has worked hard to attract positive changes to enhance community life. It became a founding member of the North West Quality of Life Plan (NWQOL). Located within its boundaries is Riverside Park, one of the city's regional parks. This park has swimming and outdoor sports opportunities, and is adjacent to three public golf courses. ==Amusement park== The Riverside Amusement Park was founded in 1903 with funding from investors from Indianapolis and Pittsburgh. It was located north of 30th Street and had a toboggan ride and concession stands. As Riverside and the surrounding area grew, the amusement park continued to expand. In 1919, under new ownership, it introduced segregation in response to the growing African- American population in the neighborhood. On most days, the park was only available to white patrons but there were special days set aside for black patrons. The park and the neighborhood both prospered during and after World War II but the neighborhood was affected by dramatic white flight. By the 1960s, the racial makeup of the neighborhood had changed to such an extent that the owners of the park were forced to desegregate in an attempt to remain profitable. This failed and the park closed in 1970. The Rivers Edge Development that now occupies the site. The community has undergone further racial changes and has add a large number of Hispanic neighbors. This has led to a dual language academy (Global Prep) opening to help bridge the language gap among elementary students. The community has started to see new houses being built as of 2018 after nearly 60 years of no new housing being developed. This trend to replace outdated and demolished housing stock is expected to continue for the next 10‚Äì15 years. New business have started to open up to serve the community needs. In the fall of 2018, 16 Tech (on the south side of the neighborhood) started the work to redevelop the former water company site. They are building a medical sciences and technology park with the goal of creating a place where innovation is able to run free and collaboration is expected. ==Current status== Riverside has been included in the umbrella neighborhood organization known as the North West Quality of Life Plan since 2014. The success of this neighborhood is rooted in its grassroots neighborhood association, the Riverside Civic League, the second-oldest neighborhood association in the city. The leadership in Riverside have historically served as Governance Chairs of the NWQOL and served as chair/advisors of many committees and organizations that are active in the Near North West Side of Downtown Indianapolis. The neighborhood is known as a leader and a strong advocate for quality of life and development that preserves and protects its residents, history, culture while bringing new opportunities to the table. Students in kindergarten through sixth grade in the Riverside neighborhood have access to their choice of three elementary schools. High school students go to Riverside High School or Northwest.

Ltd. had its beginning in 1924 as a shipping company carrying crude oil from Lake Maracaibo to its transshipment facility on the island of Aruba. ==History== With the discovery of a vast amount of crude oil under Lake Maracaibo, but unable to send it to market because the channel into Lake Maracaibo was too shallow to allow oceangoing oil tankers to enter the lake, Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company, who held the lease on a large area of Lake Maracaibo, incorporated Lago Oil & Transshipment Co. The purpose of that company was to run lake tankers, to bring crude oil from Lake Maracaibo to Aruba. There, the oil was stored ashore in large tanks, later loaded onto larger oceangoing tankers and taken to the United States for refining into finished petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, Bunker C and heating oil.  Refinery  In 1928, Standard Oil of Indiana purchased the Lago transshipment Pan American Petroleum facility in Aruba, as well as the oil holdings under Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. Standard Oil of Indiana then began to build a small refinery next to the transshipping facility port. Soon after the small refinery had been completed, a tax was anticipated to be imposed by the U S Government on imported crude. Standard of Indiana had only marketing outlets in the United States and knew they could not compete when selling imported oil that had been burdened with a toll, so they sold all their holdings to Standard Oil of New Jersey, who had marketing outlets around the world. Standard Oil of New Jersey purchased not only the small refinery in Aruba, but also the vast holding in crude oil Standard of Indiana owned under Lake Maracaibo. In 1938, Standard Oil of New Jersey obtained a contract to supply Britain with 100 octane aviation gasoline. However, because of the isolationism that was prevalent in the United States (and which indeed resulted in the US staying neutral in WWII, until the end of 1941), the contract stated that the product had to be produced outside the United States. Because Aruba was under Dutch control, the Lago refinery became an important asset by providing a place outside the United States where aviation gasoline could be produced without legal and international problems. Thus, the size of that refinery expanded long before the United States entered World War II.  Wartime  With the United States entry into World War II in 1942, the demand for Aviation gasoline further increased and considerable expansion was done at the Lago Refinery soon after that. With this expansion, Lago became one of the largest refineries in the world, only bested by Royal Dutch Shell refinery on Dutch-owned Cura√ßao, and a major producer of petroleum products for the Allied war efforts. The importance of the Lago refinery was well known to the German High Command and on February 16, 1942 the site was attacked by the German Submarine U-156. The submarine's deck gun exploded due to mistakes by the German deck gunner, and the refinery was not damaged. However, three of the lake tankers that carried crude oil from Lago Maracaibo were torpedoed.  Postwar  When demand for gasoline was high after World War II, the Lago Refinery was running at full capacity and employed over 10,000 personnel. About a thousand were foreign staff employees in supervisory positions and the remainder of the work force was from the native population of Aruba as well as \\"off-islanders\\", imported from mainly the British West Indies. These employees lived in San Nicolaas and in the interior of the island, the foreign staff employees lived in a \\"company town\\" known as Lago Colony, which was east of the refinery. In 1985, Exxon Corporation closed the Lago Refinery and began to dismantle the facility as well as the colony. Before the refinery was partially dismantled, it was taken over by the Aruba Government and sold to Coastal Corporation, which re-opened the refinery after a major overhaul but not nearly at its original capacity. Coastal later sold the refinery to Valero Energy Corporation. Late 2017, Citgo Petroleum Corporation took over the refinery. == See also == * Lake tanker * Lago Colony == References External links== * Valero Energy Corporation * Lago Colony & Lago Refinery * www.historiadiaruba.aw: Lago Oil and Transport Company Category:Defunct oil companies of the United States Category:Tanker shipping companies Category:Defunct shipping companies Category:Companies of Aruba Category:History of Aruba Category:History of Cura√ßao Category:Standard Oil Category:American companies established in 1924 Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1924 Category:Transport companies established in 1924 Category:Non-renewable resource companies disestablished in 1985 Category:1924 establishments in Cura√ßao and Dependencies Category:1920s establishments in Aruba Category:1980s disestablishments in Aruba ","title":"Lago Oil and Transport Company"},{"id":"5564920","text":"The Master of Surgery (Latin: Magister Chirurgiae) is an advanced qualification in surgery. Depending upon the degree, it may be abbreviated Ch.M., M.Ch., M.Chir. or M.S. At a typical medical school the program lasts between two and three years. The possession of a medical degree is a prerequisite. The Ch.M. can be awarded on both clinical and academic competency or on academic competency. The regulations may ask for surgical experience and a thesis topic that is not purely medical. ==History== The Masters of Surgery, or Ch.M. is an advanced qualification in surgical medicine, established in Great Britain in the middle of the 19th century. The qualification was designed to be awarded as a higher degree to the Bachelor of Surgery degree (usually Ch.B.). Many universities have stopped holding written and clinical examinations for the Ch.M., and focused solely on the thesis and oral examination. Only Oxford and Cambridge still have a (\\"Part One\\") examination before submission of the thesis and oral examination on the same for the degrees which they abbreviate as M.Ch. and M.Chir. respectively. Many universities stopped offering the Ch.M. award when it became common for trainee surgeons to take the F.R.C.S. examination of one or other Royal College of Surgeons in basic sciences and clinical subjects. ==Ch.M. Today== Following the success of its MSc in Surgical Sciences, the University of Edinburgh Medical School re-established the Ch.M. award in 2011, as an online distance learning degree, in collaboration with the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh. The focus of the Ch.M. was to prepare advanced surgical trainees for their F.R.C.S. examination, thereby reinstating the purpose of the Ch.M. degree and aligning it with the I.S.C.P. curriculum. The Ch.M. therefore combines the academic and professional development of the surgeon approaching independent consultancy. The Ch.M. consolidates the application of specialist surgical knowledge in any clinical setting and is of relevance to independent surgical practice anywhere in the world. The online distance learning Ch.M. uses case and problem-based learning and combines both academic and research components. Each Ch.M. degree programme carries 120 credits which are taught at postgraduate SCQF level 12.

It was invented by Frenchman Michel Montignac (1944‚Äì2010), an international executive for the pharmaceutical industry, who, like his father, was overweight in his youth. His method is aimed at people wishing to lose weight efficiently and lastingly, reduce risks of heart failure, and prevent diabetes. The Montignac diet is based on the glycemic index (GI) and forbids high‚Äêcarbohydrate foods that stimulate secretion of insulin. ==Principle== Carbohydrate-rich foods are classified according to their glycemic index (GI), a ranking system for carbohydrates based on their effect on blood glucose levels after meals. High-GI carbohydrates are considered \\"bad\\" (with the exception of those foodstuffs like carrots that, even though they have high GIs, have a quite low carbohydrate content and should not significantly affect blood sugar levels, also called low glycemic load or low GL). The glycemic index was devised by Jenkins et al. at the University of Toronto as a way of conveniently classifying foods according to the way they affected blood sugar and was developed for diabetics suffering from diabetes mellitus. Montignac was the first to recommend using the glycemic index as a slimming diet rather than a way of managing blood sugar levels, and recommendations to avoid sharp increases in glucose blood sugar levels (as opposed to gradual increases) as a strategy for anyone to lose weight rather than a strategy for diabetics to stabilize blood sugar levels. Montignac's diet was followed by the South Beach Diet that also used the GI principle, and Michael Mosley's 5:2 diet incorporates a recommendation to select foods with a low glycemic index or glycemic load. \\"Bad carbohydrates\\", such as those in sweets, potatoes, rice and white bread, may not be taken together with fats, especially during Phase 1 of the Method. According to Montignac's theory, these combinations will lead to the fats in the food being stored as body fat. (Some kinds of pasta, such as \\"al dente\\" durum wheat spaghetti, some varieties of rice, such as long- grain Basmati, whole grains and foods rich in fiber, have a lower GI.) Another aspect of the diet regards the choice of fats: the desirability of fatty foods depends on the nature of their fatty acids: polyunsaturated omega 3 acids (fish fat) as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (olive oil) are the best choice, while saturated fatty acids (butter and animal fat) should be restricted. Fried foods and butter used in cooking should be avoided. The Montignac Method is divided into two phases. Phase I: the weight-losing phase. This phase consists chiefly of eating the appropriate carbs, namely those with glycemic index ranked at 35 or lower (pure glucose is 100 by definition). A higher protein intake, such as 1.3-1.5 grams per kg of body weight, especially from fish and legumes, can help weight loss, but people with kidney disease should ask their doctor. Phase II: stabilization and prevention phase. Montignac states on his website that we \\"can even enhance our ability to choose by applying a new concept, the glycemic outcome (synthesis between glycemic index and pure carbohydrate content) and the blood sugar levels which result from the meals. Under these conditions, we can eat whatever carbohydrate we want, even those with high glycemic indexes\\". In his books, Montignac also provides a good number of filling French and Mediterranean style recipes. The pleasure of food and the feeling of fullness are key concepts in the Method as they are believed to help dieters stick to the rules in the long term and not go on a binge. Montignac also recommends that dieters should never miss a meal, and have between-meal snacks if that helps to eat less at meals. ==Scientific studies== Montignac's theory is disputed by nutrition experts who claim that any calorie intake that exceeds the amount that the body needs will be converted into body fat. It has been argued that Montignac confuses the direction of causality between obesity and hyperinsulinemia and that the weight loss is simply due to the hypocaloric character of the diet.David S Ludwig and Robert H Eckel The glycemic index at 20 y1,2 Kathleen Melanson and Johanna Dwyer in the Handbook of Obesity Treatment have noted that: The scientific literature refutes the hypotheses of Montignac regarding the metabolic effects of carbohydrates and fatty acids.Ann M. Coulston, MS, RD Gerald M. Reaven MD; Stanford University Medical Center - Editorial in Diabetes Care Much Ado about (Almost) Nothing Critics also point out that the Glycemic Index is not easy to use, as it depends on the exact variety of the food; how it was cooked; combinations with other foods in the same meal, and so on. Despite these scientific doubts, there are other serious scientific studies which endorse this method. See however a comment to this paper: Although a review concluded that low glycemic index diets do not achieve greater weight loss than low-fat diets, the former might lead to greater reductions in cardiovascular risk factors. ==Popularity== Montignac sold 15 million books about his diet, and his method has been made famous by the celebrities who adopted it, including G√©rard Depardieu and others.\\"French gastronome Michel Montignac is a diet guru with a difference\\", news article in India Today Plus ==See also== * Diabetic diet * Glycemic efficacy * Glycemic index#Weight control * Glycemic load * Insulin index * List of diets * Low glycemic index diet == References External links== * Official Montignac website * Explanation of the Montignac Method Category:Diets Category:Fad diets Category:Low-carbohydrate diets ","title":"Montignac diet"},{"id":"5565000","text":"Claverdon railway station serves the village of Claverdon in Warwickshire, England.

Murphy (born July 29, 1964) is a retired American basketball player. Born in Dover, Delaware, Murphy played one season in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Portland Trail Blazers. He was drafted by Portland in the first round (17 overall) of the 1987 NBA draft out of Jacksonville University, where he played for four years. Listed at and , Murphy played one season in the NBA (1987‚Äì88) as a guard-forward appearing in a total of 18 games with an average of 2.0 points 0.6 rebounds per game. His rookie season ended after he fractured his fifth metatarsal bone during a practice in March 1988. Murphy was suspended by the Trail Blazers before the 1988‚Äì89 season for not maintaining a proper weight. Murphy had been suspended the prior season for the same reason. Portland waived Murphy in December 1988 after he spent more than a month on the suspended list. Through his agent, Murphy accused the Trail Blazers of waiving him while he was recovering from an injury, which was against NBA rules. Portland settled the dispute with Murphy, who never played in the NBA subsequently. In 1991, he attempted a comeback and played one season in the United States Basketball League. ==Early life== Murphy was born on July 29, 1964 in Dover, Delaware. He attended Oviedo High School in Oviedo, Florida where he played basketball. In 1983, Murphy enrolled at Jacksonville University. He played on the men's basketball team and was named Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year in 1984. During his first season, Murphy played and started in 26 games and averaged 17.9 points per game with 5.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.5 steals. During his junior season, Murphy scored 19 points to help the Jacksonville Dolphins defeat the UAB Blazers, 70‚Äì69, for the Sun Belt Conference Championship on March 1, 1986 in Birmingham, Alabama. With their conference championship victory, Jacksonville earned a spot in the 1986 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. They were ranked in the eight seed and faced off against the Temple Owls, who were seeded ninth. Murphy scored 22 points in the Dolphins' 61‚Äì50 overtime loss, which eliminated them from the tournament. ==Portland Trail Blazers== 1987‚Äì88 season During his rookie season, Murphy admittedly showed up out of shape to the Trail Blazers training camp on October 4, 1987. He was listed at , but head coach Mike Schuler told Dwight Jaynes of The Oregonian that Murphy was \\"a few pounds over that\\". The next two days it was reported Murphy sat out of a scrimmage due to a sprained ankle, however, it was later reported that he was unable to practice with the team since he was not under contract. On October 9, Murphy signed a contract with Portland. Murphy's foot injury was later diagnosed as a \\"stress reaction\\". Team trainers had him swim and use an exercise bike to rehabilitate. Murphy began the season on the injured reserve list. It was announced November 23, 1987 that Murphy had been suspended without pay by Portland for failing to undergo a weight loss program. The suspension had been in place since November 13, but head coach Mike Schuler said the announcement was delayed in hopes Murphy would take the program seriously. Team trainers suspected Murphy's weight, which was estimated at , complicated the recovery of his injured foot. The day before his suspension was announced, Murphy insulted Schuler in front of the team in the locker room of the Memorial Coliseum after the Blazers' 120‚Äì110 victory over the Indiana Pacers. Following a Blazers game on November 24, Schuler told reporters \\"We drafted Ronnie Murphy to play. [...] We did not draft Ronnie Murphy to sit him out. He has not presented himself in shape and it's nobody's fault but Ronnie Murphy's. [...] He has an obligation as a pro basketball player. This isn't college. You can only talk to people so many times and say the same things.\\" Murphy was taken off the suspended list on December 6, 1987 and medically cleared to return to practice, despite staying on the injured reserve list. Schuler gave the press an update on Murphy on December 18 saying, \\"He has to improve his physical status. He has made progress, but he isn't there yet.\\" Murphy made his NBA debut on December 20 against the San Antonio Spurs in Portland. He played two minutes and missed one attempted field goal and two attempted free throws in the Blazers' 148‚Äì126 victory. To make room on the roster for Murphy, Portland allowed forward Nikita Wilson to sign with an overseas club and the Blazers placed him on their suspended list. Early in January 1988 it was reported that Portland's front office was looking to trade Murphy due to the glut of guards on their roster. Murphy scored his career high in points with 11 on January 13 against the Utah Jazz. When Portland guard Jim Paxson returned from injury on January 16, Murphy was moved to the third shooting guard on the Blazers' depth chart. Murphy gave an interview to in Dwight Jaynes of The Oregonian in late January in which he said, \\"[his] weight problem was blown out of proportion\\". Before the NBA trade deadline, David Kahn of The Oregonian reported that Portland offered Murphy to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Cadillac Anderson, but the trade was declined. Murphy fractured his fifth metatarsal bone during a one-on-one practice session with teammate Clyde Drexler at the Riverplace Athletic Club in Downtown Portland on March 21, 1988. He played a total of 18 games during the 1987‚Äì88 season with an average of 2.0 points per game with a .286 field goal percentage. 1988‚Äì89 season During the 1988 NBA expansion draft, Portland left Murphy unprotected, although he was not one of the 23 players selected. It was announced in the off-season before the 1988‚Äì89 season that Murphy was assigned to the Blazers rookie training camp at the Portland Community College Sylvania campus. Portland general manager Bucky Buckwalter told The Oregonian sportswriter Dwight Jaynes, \\"[Murphy's] career largely depends on what he does this summer.\\" Blazers' head coach Mike Schuler met with Murphy and told him that the team wanted him down to before training camp. On July 18, the camp opened and within an hour of practice Murphy, who weighed in at , was sidelined with a sore foot. After getting advice from team doctors, Murphy went to a Seattle, Washington based doctor for a second opinion, who recommended physical therapy. Murphy was placed on the Blazers' Summer League roster, but his foot injury kept him out of action. By October 1988, Portland coaches noted a change in Murphy's attitude. Assistant coach Rick Adelman told Dwight Jaynes of The Oregonian, \\"I think [Murphy's] attitude is much better [...] He has done a good job. He has been very positive and very receptive.\\" Head coach Mike Schuler noted Murphy was in better shape and praised his hard work. He was the team's starting point guard, in place of an injured Terry Porter, during their first preseason game on October 6 against the Detroit Pistons. Murphy's foot, which had troubled him his entire career, was injured again during the preseason. He played through the injury since he was competing for a back-up guard spot on Portland's regular season roster. On November 3, 1988, the Trail Blazers announced they were suspending Murphy because he had failed to meet a goal body weight and body fat percentage the team had set for him during the off-season. The move freed up a roster spot that Portland immediately filled with free agent guard Danny Young. Sportswriter Dwight Jaynes asked general manager Bucky Buckwalter why the team did not just waive Murphy's contract, to which Buckwalter replied, \\"We have always liked his skills [...] He has made some progress. We want to give him every chance.\\" Murphy's suspension meant the Trail Blazers did not have to pay his guaranteed salary for the season. Buckwalter denied that there was a financial motive behind Murphy's suspension. On November 23, while still under suspension, Murphy was allowed to practice with the team. He played only five minutes of a scrimmage game before being sidelined with an ankle injury. Murphy was waived by the Trail Blazers on December 7, 1988. Former teammate Jerome Kersey spoke positively of Murphy, telling The Oregonian, \\"Honestly, I don't think we have a backup two-guard. [...] Ronnie could do that for us. He could have provided a spark off the bench. I'm quite sure someone will pick him up. He's a talented kid.\\" Portland head coach Mike Schuler was less kind saying, \\"From what I've seen in the time he was with us, he didn't have enough overall skills.\\" The Blazers were still responsible for paying Murphy guaranteed salary. He signed with the Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets of the Continental Basketball Association after clearing waivers. After his first practice in Cedar Rapids, Murphy complained of pain in his foot. It was examined by a doctor who diagnosed him with a stress fracture on the fifth metatarsal on his right foot, the same one he injured the prior season. Murphy's agent John Phillips announced they were protesting Portland's waiver with the NBA since league rules prohibit waiving injured players. Trail Blazers president Harry Glickman denied any wrongdoing, but the team's physician, Dr. Robert Cook, told Oregonian sportswriter David Kahn that Murphy's injury in March 1987 may have never fully healed. Phillips also alleged Murphy was being paid under the table during his suspension, which was denied by Glickman who called the payments a contract advance. A total of $50,000 () was paid to Murphy during the time it was reported he was suspended without pay. On January 5, 1989 it was announced the Trail Blazers had entered negotiations with Murphy's agent John Phillips to end their dispute against the team. Murphy was no longer demanding reinstatement on Portland's roster and requested $25,000 () in salary lost during his suspension in 1987. Portland's attorney Kenneth E. Roberts told Phillips that the team would pay for Murphy's medical expenses. He underwent surgery on his foot, which doctors estimated would keep Murphy sidelined for four to six months. ==Later life== After his foot surgery, Murphy's weight increased to as much as . He was a patient at the Baker International Wellness Clinic at Amelia Island Plantation in Florida where he lost nearly in five weeks. Eventually, Murphy gained the weight back and attempted a comeback through the United States Basketball League in 1991. He started the season at , but lost over the duration of the season. He averaged 4.7 points per game and 1.6 rebounds per game with a .400 three point percentage as backup guard for the Jacksonville Hooters. Reflecting on his career in 1991, Murphy told Tim Povtak of the Orlando Sentinel, \\"People all the time say, 'If I had your chance, I wouldn't have let it slip away.'

Short Political Biography of Madhu Limaye. academia.edu A follower of Ram Manohar Lohia and a fellow-traveller of George Fernandes, he was active in the Janata government that gained power at the Centre following the Emergency. He, with Raj Narain and Krishan Kant was also responsible for the collapse of the Morarji Desai-led Janata government installed by that coalition, by insisting that no member of the Janata Party could simultaneously be a member of an alternative social or political organisation. This attack on dual membership was directed specifically at members of the Janata Party who had been members of the Jan Sangh, and continued to be members of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Jan Sangh's ideological parent.

It is situated in the linear settlement of the same name (Hatton Station), that evolved around the station, mainly in the 1950s and 1960s. Other close settlements are Little Shrewley and Shrewley. The station is managed by Chiltern Railways. Hatton is the junction station at which the lines from Leamington Spa to Stratford-upon-Avon and Birmingham diverge. The station is unstaffed; ticketing is restricted to a 'Permit-to-Travel' machine located at the single entrance to the station on the London-bound (southbound) platform. There is a small shelter on Platform 1 (southbound - for trains from Birmingham to Leamington Spa) and also one on the island platform, which consists of Platforms 2 and 3 (Platform 2 is for Birmingham-bound services and Platform 3 is for stations from/to Stratford upon Avon, which bear to the west immediately north of the station. Trains can, however, use both Platforms 2 and 3 to reach Birmingham, as the outside the station, the lines re-join). A footbridge links Platform 1 with island Platform 2/3. Each platform at the station is equipped with a real-time electronic information departure screen. ==History== The station dates from 1852 (being opened by the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway), with the branch to Stratford opening in 1860 (this had a later extension, now closed, from Bearley Junction to added in 1876).Warwickshire Railways - Hatton stationWarwickshire Railways; Retrieved 12 October 2016 It sits part way along a 5-mile (8 km) long rising section of line with a ruling gradient of 1 in 110 for northbound trains known as Hatton Bank - this section was often difficult to negotiate for heavy freights and the use of banking engines was commonplace. The station had its platforms extended in 1892 and further remodelling of the track in the area would follow over the next two decades. By 1939 the branch had been doubled, but the western end to Alcester was closed in 1951 and it reverted to single track in 1969, when signalling control was transferred to the newly commissioned panel box at Saltley. ==Services== Off-peak, all services at Hatton are operated by Chiltern Railways. The current off-peak service is: * 1 train every 2 hours to * 1 train every 2 hours to London Marylebone * 1 train every 2 hours to * 1 train every 2 hours to These services combine to give an hourly service off- peak. During the peak hours, the service is strengthened with Chiltern Trains between London and Birmingham making calls at the station.

This became a diverse range of breads that include focaccia in Italian cuisine, hogaza in Spain, fogassa in Catalonia, fug√†ssa in Ligurian, pogaƒça in the Balkans, pog√°csa in Hungary, fougasse in Provence (originally spelled fogatza), fouace or fou√©e in other French regions and on the Channel Islands.fou√©e at Jersey (Norman language) The Provence version is more likely to have additions like olives, cheese, garlic or anchovies, which are like a primitive form of pizza without the tomato. There is also in Portugal the foga√ßa, a sweet bread. In Brazil, p√£o sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Esp√≠rito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as p√£o franc√™s or p√£o-de-sal), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called p√£o su√≠√ßo. They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil. Fougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded. Fougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts. ==Use in dishes== It is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Other variations include dried fruit, Roquefort and nuts or olives and goat cheese.

The NWAC (\\"En-Wack\\") was originally formed in 1946 as the Washington State Junior College Athletic Conference (WSJCAC). In 1961, the state Legislature removed a legal roadblock that had barred the establishment of junior colleges in counties with four-year colleges. After the Legislature took action, the number of schools in the WAACC nearly doubled. Three years later, the conference was renamed the Washington Athletic Association of Community Colleges (WAACC). In 1970 the conference admitted its first non-Washington member, Mt. Hood Community College of Gresham, Oregon, which had left the Oregon Community College Athletic Association (OCCAA). At that time, the WAACC became the Northwest AACC, reflecting its two-state membership. The NWAACC merged with its Oregon counterpart in 1983, resulting in a 26-member circuit stretching from southwestern Oregon to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. On July 1, 2014, the conference announced that they were becoming the Northwest Athletic Conference.NWAACC becomes NWAC, Marco Azurdia, Executive Director, NWAC website, The NWAC, now with 36 members, is the largest community college conference in the United States.

Following the nine charter members, Columbia Basin College joined in 1955. Initially, the conference offered football, basketball, baseball, tennis, track and golf. In 1963 wrestling was added, followed by cross country in 1965 and soccer in 1974. The WSJCAC existed without bylaws until the spring of 1948, when Executive Secretary Jim Ennis of Everett JC, Dave DuVall of Skagit Valley and Maury Phipps of Grays Harbor, wrote the conference's original constitution. The document set forth the overall philosophy of the conference's athletic program, and prescribed scholarship limits and grade eligibility requirements. 1963: Birth of Oregon's Conference In 1963, five Oregon schools joined to form the Oregon Community College Athletic Association (OCCAA). Charter members were Blue Mountain, Central Oregon, Clatsop, Southwestern Oregon and Treasure Valley community colleges. The conference more than doubled in size in the 1968-69 school year, when Chemeketa, Clackamas, Lane, Linn-Benton, Mt. Hood, Portland and Umpqua community colleges joined the circuit. 1970s: The NWAACC and the Rise of Women's Athletics During the 1970s, the newly renamed NWAACC saw the growth of women's sports at its member institutions. Women's athletics were governed by the Northwest College Women's Sports Association (NCWSA) until 1978, when the NCWSA was absorbed by the NWAACC. Volunteer athletic directors had overseen conference functions and activities until the addition of women's athletics. The subsequent increased workload caused the NWAACC to convene a five-member hiring committee, which in 1979 appointed Frank Bosone as the conference's first executive director. Bosone retired in 1992 and was succeeded by Dick McClain, a longtime baseball coach in Corvallis, Oregon. 1983: Merger Community college athletics in the Pacific Northwest changed dramatically in 1983, when seven OCCAA members joined the NWAACC. The merger between the Washington and Oregon colleges has helped the NWAACC become a strong organization. Since 1984, nine other colleges have added intercollegiate athletics and/or became NWAACC members. Today: The NWAACC was renamed the Northwest Athletic Conference on July 1, 2014 NWAACC becomes NWAC, Marco Azurdia, Executive Director, NWAC website, July 1, 2014 and has 36 member schools. == Sports == The NWAC sponsors intercollegiate athletic competition in the following sports: {  style= + Conference sports !SportMen'sWomen's - Baseball - Basketball - Cross Country - Golf - Soccer - Softball  - Tennis - Track and field (outdoor) - Volleyball  } ==References External links == *NWAC Homepage *NWAC TV Category:Northwest Athletic Association of Community Colleges Category:1946 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Northwest Athletic Conference"},{"id":"5565185","text":"The Bent Sae Brown is Child ballad 71.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"The Bent Sae Brown\\" ==Synopsis== Willie crosses land and sea to his love Annie.

The lyrics of the song were written by Bernie Taupin and the melody composed by John for his eponymous second album in 1970. It was recorded at Trident Studios in London in January 1970 and released in the United States in October 1970 as the A-side of a single, with \\"Your Song\\" as the B-side. Both songs received airplay, but \\"Your Song\\" was preferred by disc jockeys, becoming the singer's first hit (on both sides of the Atlantic) and rendering \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\" as the B-side. ==Composition and inspiration== Many‚Äîincluding Elton John himselfInterview: The Late Late Show with James Corden, March 1, 2018‚Äîfind the song's lyrics cryptic and incomprehensible. \\"If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial. And I'm here in your prison. Like a coin in your mint, I am dented. And I'm spent with high treason. Through a glass eye your throne, is the one danger zone. Take me to the pilot for control, take me to the pilot of your soul.\\" Lyricist Bernie Taupin has admitted to not knowing what the song's lyrics represent, comparing his writing style in \\"Pilot\\" to poets like \\"Baudelaire and Rimbaud...(who) just threw things together and went 'Wow! That sounds good'\\". The lyrics possess many elements: betrayal, either political or personal (\\"treason\\"); the illusion of danger (\\"through a glass eye\\"); and fearlessness toward the unknown (\\"take me to the pilot of your soul\\"). According to Elton, this and other songs recorded during this period were inspired by the science fiction books Bernie was reading at the time. The country duo Brothers Osborne recorded a remake of the song for the 2018 tribute album Restoration: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin. ==Song history== This has become a staple of John's live shows and can be heard on many of his concert recordings ‚Äî such as a performance with his early 1970s backup musicians, bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson on 17-11-70 (1970) to Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (1987) with a full scale orchestral reworking the original Paul Buckmaster score. John also performs the song in a solo version on the album Live in Moscow recorded in 1979. There have also been numerous notable cover versions from the likes of Jos√© Feliciano, folk/blues guitarist Buzzy Linhart, British Group Orange Bicycle, R&B; vocalist Ben E. King, blues icon Odetta, pianist Nate Hopkins, a duet between singers Al Jarreau and Gloria Loring, and third-season contestant George Huff on American Idol. The Who segue into it from \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\" on the Elton John/Bernie Taupin tribute album, Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin. In 1983, Kikki Danielsson covered the song on her Singles Bar album.Information at Svensk mediedatabas Elton once quoted, in The Red Piano Tour in 2005, \\"And in the early days, there were a lot of inquiries about 'What does this song mean? What does that song mean?' and in the case of 'Take me to the pilot/Lead me through the chamber/Take me to the pilot/I am but a stranger', I have no idea! You're on your own, I tell you.\\" American Idol season 3 winner Fantasia Barrino and Season 11 Top 3 finalist Joshua Ledet performed this song on the American Idol season 11 Finale. The song was also featured in the soundtrack of the 2018 Showtime limited series Escape at Dannemora.

It is a white chalk cliff face which opens up into spectacular grottos. The Rosh HaNikra grottoes are cavernous tunnels formed by sea action on the soft chalk rock. The total length of the tunnels is some 200 meters. They branch off in various directions with some interconnecting segments. A tunnel was built by the British for the Haifa-Beirut railroad line, and in 1968 a second one was dug, both connecting the grottoes with each other and allowing access (currently: only exit) along the former route of the British railroad. For many years though, the only access to the grottoes was from the sea and the native swimmers and divers were the only ones capable of visiting. The 400 meters long tunnel dug in 1968 between the grottoes and slightly above sea level allowed easier access, and soon after a cable car was built to take visitors down from the top of the cliff to the tunnels. Jewish Virtual Library, Rosh Hanikra Israel Rosh Hanikra Grotto and Cable Car Brochure 1970s With a 60-degree gradient, this cable car is advertised as the steepest in the world. A kibbutz, also named Rosh HaNikra, is located nearby. The Israeli city Nahariya is located about 10 km (6 miles) south of Rosh HaNikra. Recognition of the potential offered by the unusual Rosh Hanikra grottoes led to the development of this beautiful site as a tourist attraction for Northern Israel. The project was spearheaded by Bawer Mizna as Mayor of one of the kibbutzim as well as an Arab town. He and his wife, Miriam, were among the original settlers of the area and of the nearby kibbutz, Matzuvah. ==History== thumb The Book of Joshua mentions \\"Misraphot Mayim\\" as a place south of Rosh HaNikra that was the border of the Israelite tribes of the time., also: In the First Book of the Maccabees, it is referred to as the place that Shimon HaHashmonai was responsible for in 144BCE (1 Maccabees 11:59). Josephus Flavius also describes Rosh Hanikra as the northern border of the city of Acre, Israel. (The Jewish War 2, 10, 2). The archaeological tellTadmor, Miriam: article \\"Rosh Ha-Niqra, Tel\\", in: Stern, Ephraim: The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land, Vol 4, Jerusalem 1993 (English), pp. 1288-1289 is today situated within the kibbutz. In the Jewish First Book of Maccabees (), a cape in this region is referred to as the \\"Ladder of Tyre\\" (; ); the author could have meant either the cliffs at Rosh HaNikra, or one of two other capes jutting out into the sea slightly north or south of them. International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, Ladder of TyreRosh HaNikra official website BibleGateway.com, Ladder of Tyre The site was later named an-Nawakir (\\"The Grottoes\\") by the Arabs. Rosh HaNikra has served as a passage point for trade caravans and armies between Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Egypt, and Africa. During the Second World War, South African forces blasted railway tunnels through the nearby rocks for trains running along the Cairo- Istanbul line. The railway bridge at Rosh HaNikra was spared by the Haganah during the 1946 Night of the Bridges operation but, following a late-1947 British announcement that it would withdraw from Palestine months ahead of schedule, the bridge was destroyed by the 21st Battalion under the Palmach in late February 1948 to hinder Lebanese arms shipments to Arab forces opposing the UN Partition Plan. As repairs were prohibitively expensive, the tunnels were later completely sealed. The Lebanese railways have been largely dismantled while the Coastal Railway in Israel currently ends near Nahariya, several kilometers to the south. Rosh Hanikra was the location where Israeli and Lebanese officials negotiated and concluded an armistice agreement in 1949 which ended the Lebanese-Israeli component of the 1948 War of Israeli Independence. A border passage across the Blue Line into Lebanon at the site is sometimes used by UNIFIL personnel. ==Nature reserves and national park== The area around Rosh HaNikra includes a number of nature reserves: * The Rosh HaNikra islands - 311 dunams declared in 1965 * The Rosh HaNikra reserve - 500 dunams declared in 1969, and an additional 765 dunams in 1996. * Rosh HaNikra beach - 230 dunams, declared in 2003 The Rosh HaNikra national park also has jurisdiction of 220 dunams in the area. ==Cable car== thumb The Rosh HaNikra cable car is a cable car serving tourists wishing to visit the grottoes. The cable car is situated very close to the Lebanese border. The site is popular with tourists, and is one of the facilities available for tourists in Kibbutz Rosh HaNikra. The cable car was manufactured by Austrian manufacturer Doppelmayr Garaventa Group, and claims to be the steepest cable car in the world, ascending at a gradient of 60 degrees. Inasmuch as its lower base station is located on the sea, the cable car is occasionally affected by stormy weather. ==See also== *Geography of Israel *Tourism in Israel *Hiking in Israel ==ReferencesGallery== Image:Rosh HaNikra.jpg Image:Rosh HaNikra Grottoes 1.jpg Image:Rosh HaNikra Grottoes 2.jpg Image:Rosh HaNikra Grottoes 3.jpg Image:Rosh HaNikra grottoes.jpg Image:PICT0080.JPG File:Inside the Rosh Hanikra cave05.jpg ==External links== * Rosh HaNikra Official Site- Hebrew * Rosh HaNikra Official Site- English * . * . * Photos of Rosh haNikra Category:Caves of Israel Category:National parks of Israel Category:Nature reserves in Israel Category:Grottoes Category:Sea caves Category:Protected areas of Northern District (Israel) Category:Landforms of Northern District (Israel) Rosh HaNikra cable car ","title":"Rosh HaNikra grottoes"},{"id":"5565217","text":"A hypervariable region (HVR) is a location within nuclear DNA or the D-loop of mitochondrial DNA in which base pairs of nucleotides repeat (in the case of nuclear DNA) or have substitutions (in the case of mitochondrial DNA).

Williams (February 11, 1938 ‚Äì October 28, 2018) was a Vancouver-based Canadian producer, director, actor, choreographer, and writer. == Biography == Early life Williams was born Donald William Schlit in Edmonton, Alberta in February 1938. He grew up in the small community of Stony Plain, Alberta, just west of Edmonton where he graduated from Memorial High School in 1955. From the age of twelve, he had a keen interest in the Film and Entertainment Industry. Career Williams started his career in 1957, at the age of 19, when he moved to the Alberta/Saskatchewan border town of Lloydminster and began working at the new CKSA radio station. In the following year (1958), Williams accepted a one-year contract at the CKRM radio station in Regina, Saskatchewan. As soon as that contract was up (in 1959 - exactly 365 days later), Don left for Brandon, Manitoba where he worked both as the sole Producer and Director at the local CKX-TV station and Artistic Director for the Brandon New World Theatre. He continued in these roles for the next four years, 3 months and 8 days. In 1963, Williams landed a job as Staff Producer/Director at the CBC station (CBWT) in Winnipeg. He spent 15 and half years there: the first five at the CBC and the remainder working as a freelance director, producer, and writer. With the freelance work came a great deal of travel - a considerable portion of which was to Vancouver. One of his early opportunities as a freelancer was to work as the Director of the third and fifth episode of the then-new CBC series, The Beachcombers - a show that would go on to be the longest running series in Canadian television history. Since so much of his freelance work saw him travelling more and more to Vancouver (largely because of his growing involvement with The Beachcombers), in 1979 Williams decided to move his family to Vancouver. Over the ensuing years, Don continued to be involved with The Beachcombers in the capacities of director, producer, and executive producer. Additionally, he was involved in projects that saw him directing other notable people from the entertainment industry when they were at the early stages of their careers, such as Cameron Bancroft, Chief Dan George, Michael J. Fox, and Bruce Greenwood (in both The Beachcombers and in 21 episodes of a 1979 live-to-tape comedy mini-series called \\"Dr. Bundolo\\". He has also worked as the director of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. In 1991, Williams made a decision to focus more on acting citing that \\"the market is good for overweight middle-aged men.\\" After appearing as a guest star in shows such as Wiseguy, Mom P.I., The Commish, and Neon Rider, in 1995, Don landed the role that he would become best recognized for - appearing in the recurring role of The First Elder on the hit Fox series The X-Files. He made regular appearances in that role until 1999 - including an appearance in The X-Files Movie. He also appeared in the films The Stepfather and Reindeer Games. From 1968 to 1978 Williams also worked as the Chief Negotiator for collective bargaining agreements for the CTPDA (Canadian Television Producers and Directors Association) - an association of which he was one of the founders. During his time there, he became known as a \\"raving moderate.\\" Political Involvement Williams started being interested in politics as a young child - getting much of his political awareness from his maternal grandfather (an Alberta Social Credit supporter). It was from his grandfather that Williams came to believe that, if you don't like the political situation, you have to get involved in the political system. Williams joined the Liberal Party of Canada in 1965. He has worked on campaigns for the party both federally and provincially (in both Manitoba and British Columbia). In fact, Williams worked as the Director of Communications for the campaign of Izzy Asper in the 1973 Manitoba Election. Locally, in North Vancouver, Williams ran unsuccessfully for the North Vancouver School Board the North Vancouver District Council. Personal life Williams had two children; a daughter, son, as well as two grandchildren and one great grandchild. In 1993, Williams was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease ‚Äì a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. In March 2002, a small flurry of media interest erupted when it was revealed by documentary film-maker Gerry Thompson (for the Canadian broadcaster CTV) that Don was one of four people who worked together at the CBC in 1979 (the most famous being Michael J. Fox) who would all later go on to not only develop Parkinson's Disease, but to have the symptoms appear at roughly the same time (the early 1990s). Current evidence suggests that as many as eight crew and cast members on the project have developed Parkinson's symptoms. This unusual coincidence led to the suggestion that Parkinson's may possibly have some sort of environmental trigger. Thus, during the week of March 22‚Äì29, 2002, Williams and his doctor were interviewed by Good Morning America, ABC News, NBC News, Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood, CNN, People Magazine, MacLean's Magazine, CTV and The New York Times.

Now, Nasr City is extremely crowded, much more than was expected from the creation of the district, because of Egyptian families relocating to the district and also because of Somali and South Sudanese immigration to areas of Nasr City such as Hay El Asher (10th Neighbourhood). It is the largest district in Cairo, occupying nearly of the capital's total area of . For this reason, it is divided into 10 sub-districts, of which numbers 6-10 are called by their respective numbers and the first 5 are called by their names. It has a modern road system, and grid street system, which stands in contrast to the narrow winding streets of much of Old Cairo. Tram system partly serve Nasr City. Also, other forms of transportation exist in Nasr City, including minibuses, microbuses (share taxis), and tuk-tuks (in the 10th district of Nasr City). ==Administration== Administratively, Nasr City covers kism (fully urban wards) Madƒ´nat an-Na·π£r 1 and Madƒ´nat an-Na·π£r 2. ==Culture== When catching a microbus, minibus or even a CTA bus, specific hand signs may be used. These signs include putting the index and middle fingers in an upwards \\"V\\", which is the Arabic numeral 7, for the 7th district, placing those fingers upside down in a downwards \\"V\\", which is the Arabic number 8, for the 8th district, or putting out a hand and slowly opening and closing the fingers slightly above the start of the palm for the 10th district. The district is home to many socioeconomic strata. During Ramadan, the comparative wealth of districts can be determined by whether there are electric lights or simply colored flags. The 10th district of Nasr City is home to refugees and immigrants of various countries, such as Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, China, Malaysia, and even the United States. There are many mosques, such as the Masjid al Nour al Mohamedi or Masjid El Ghofran. Also, there are falafel stands, shawarma restaurants, a koshari restaurant near the main road, and pharmacies. Due to the proximity to the airport, there are often planes flying overhead. Nasr City is home to the new premises of Al-Azhar University, the Cairo International Conference Center, Cairo International Stadium, a branch of the Ahly Club, Saint Fatima School and several government buildings. Among its major landmarks is the pyramid-like Unknown Soldier Memorial honoring the Egyptian and other Arab servicemen killed in the October War of 1973. The Memorial is opposite the grandstand at which President Sadat was assassinated, and is where Sadat himself is buried. The Revolution has led to the presence of colorful graffiti on the road from Masjid al Salaam in the 8th subdistrict to the Ahly branch in Nasr City. This branch has two swimming pools, a large soccer field, a track where members can exercise, a gym, and many stores and restaurants. Members can enter for free, but non-members must pay 40 Egyptian pounds for a ticket during normal weekdays, 50 pounds during weekends and 60 pounds during national holidays. Nasr City also has many mosques, and during the times of prayer, one may hear multiple live adhans preceded and followed by Quranic recitation. Sometimes, the prayers themselves are broadcast through the loudspeakers. ==Education== Nasr City is overpopulated, and as such there are numerous schools found in the district. This section will list only a few of the many educational options for children in grades K-12. Private schools offering the Egyptian curriculum include Roots Language school, Harvard Egypt college, Alahram language school, Al Bayan Modern school, Al Manhal school, a branch of Futures Educational systems, one of Nermien Ismail National school's branches, the Egyptian Language school, El Alson language schools, and El Andalaus Azharian schools. Public experimental schools (offering the national curriculum in English) include El Sedeek Experimental school, Ibn El Nafees Experimental school, Elmostakbal language experimental schools, and Abbas El Akkad Experimental schools. Ordinary public schools (offering the national curriculum in Arabic) can be found in every neighborhood. International options include the Futures Educational Systems American school and the Roots International school (British curriculum). Assignment to public schools or experimental schools is generally based on location and siblings' current school and is supervised by the Egyptian Ministry of Education and Child Development. Application to private schools is difficult, and usually begins in the preschool (age 3-4) or KG (age 5-6) levels. However, due to Nasr City's central location, residents of the district can easily send their children to private schools in the neighboring New Cairo (to the east), Heliopolis (to the northwest) and Maadi (to the southwest) districts, with minimum commute. ==Shopping== Nasr City has a large concentration of shopping malls (Genena Mall, Tiba Outlet Mall, City Center, Serag Mall, City Stars, Suncity Mall. There are eight shopping malls in the area, where City Star is one of the largest malls in Egypt, most of which were opened in the late 1990s. There was a dramatic growth of shopping malls in the neighborhood, and they were generally more successful than similar enterprises in other parts of Cairo. One of the main reasons for the success of these commercial centers is the simple grid environment of Nasr City. The district has no town/city center and consists of long, wide streets, with roundabouts, and perpendicular streets. Nasr City has a variety of shops and leisure spaces including restaurants, coffee shops, and cinemas. The malls are usually very crowded during holidays and summer nights, while the fast-food restaurants and coffee shops remain open and busy until late at night. Late night shopping is popular in Cairo, especially in summer, and thus the malls do not open until around 11am, and peak hours begin around 10pm. Also, each sub-district has its own market, or souq, where one can buy fresh fruit, vegetables, and slaughtered meat. The souq in the 8th district of Nasr City is located next to a gas station five minutes away by foot from the Sedeek Language School. It has a live poultry and livestock section, many fruit and vegetable stands, and a seafood section in the back. Many children of the stand owners work in the market, carrying people's purchases for them, or helping to stock the stands or watch the animals. The 10th district of Nasr City has the biggest market, with at least 3 butchers, 5-6 large fruit and vegetable stands, multiple clothing stores, and slightly crowded streets. The architecture and decoration of the newly built shopping malls of Nasr City are influenced greatly by building designs in the Gulf and Southeast Asia. The architecture of the Wonderland Mall is marked by its Oriental aspects while the design of the Geneina Mall, with its transparent glass elevators, resembles the design of Southeast Asian malls in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Some of the malls in Nasr City, like the Sirag, and Geneina malls, have associate housing and apartments above the shopping spaces. Although these malls are in close proximity with to another, there is no strict competition between them as most cater to different types of customers. Tiba Outlet Mall, for instance, is regarded as a family mall, while the Geneina Mall is popular among teenagers and youngsters due to its bowling alley, billiard centre, and discoth√®que. The Serag Mall is located in the 8th district of Nasr City, and it contains the al-Mahmal hypermarket, several clothing stores, and aquatic bumper cars in the main lobby for young children. There is also a restaurant, a cinema, and Multiple Shisha bars. These contemporary malls are exclusive and closely monitored spaces with tight security surveillance. They often demand specific behaviour and dress code from the visitors. In 1999, some malls like the World Trade Center and the as- Hurriya Mall, put restrictions on visitors wearing gallabiyas, traditional long robes that are often worn by males of the lower classes. These measures were taken by shopping mall managers in order to filter the public and stop people of lower classes from intruding the commercial space. The restriction on people wearing gallabiyas was later lifted due to the influx of Gulf visitors who also commonly wear such garments. For many, Nasr City symbolizes Cairo's nouveau-riche suburban culture that has been influenced greatly by the lifestyles of the Gulf region. This is because an influx of middle class professionals and returning migrant workers from the Gulf countries purchased property in Nasr City and settled there. Singerman, Diane, and Paul Amar, eds.

On 23 February 2018, Interoute was acquired by GTT Communications for $2.3bn (‚Ç¨1.9bn); the acquisition closed on 31 May 2018. ==Operations== Interoute's network is the largest privately owned Europe-wide IP cloud. With ten subsea landing stations ringing the edge of Europe, it acts as the landing point for a number of submarine cable systems, as well as providing the European link to the SEACOM cable connecting East and South Africa to Europe. Mediterranean operators Tunisie Telecom, Malta's GO and Greece's OTE link directly to the Interoute network in Italy. Interoute's offices: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, plus Network Operations Centres in Sofia and Prague and Customer Service Centres in Prague. ==History== Interoute was founded in 1995 and restructured into its current form amidst the collapse of the telecommunications sector. Four weeks after its holding company i-21 Holdings Ltd., went into administration, Interoute Telecommunications also went by its main supplier, Alcatel. A team led by Chairman and CEO James Kinsella undertook extensive restructuring and sold its traditional telephony operations in order to concentrate exclusively on network and Internet services. A final settlement with Alcatel was reached, effective February 2003. The core of Interoute's assets is a purpose-built network spanning the European Union. That physical infrastructure was supplemented through a series of acquisitions. Interoute acquired the Ebone portion of the KPNQwest NV network from receivers McStay Luby in July 2002. The deal transferred eight high-capacity metropolitan area networks (MANs) into Interoute's ownership, at a cost rumoured to be a fraction of the ‚Ç¨645 million KPNQwest paid for it. In November 2002, The Daily Telegraph reported that Interoute was hit by ¬£310 million debt. Between 2003 and 2007 Interoute acquired a number of businesses, including: Virtue Broadcasting's Media Services Division, to expand its value-added services portfolio; Central European Communications Holdings BV (CECOM) and its operating subsidiaries in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland and Romania, which extended its footprint in the CEE; the European operations of hosting provider VIA NET.WORKS; and PSINet's European operations in Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland; plus Managed Services businesses in Sweden and Bulgaria. More recently (Oct 2014), they acquired Vtesse Group to expand their cloud services portfolio across the UK. In September 2015, Interoute announced plans to acquire Easynet (MDNX) for ¬£402m. ==Acquisition by GTT== On 28 February 2018 GTT Communications announced the acquisition of Interoute for $2.3 billion.

A cider house is an establishment that sells alcoholic cider for consumption on the premises. Some cider houses also sell cider \\"to go\\", for consumption off the premises. A traditional cider house was often little more than a room in a farmhouse or cottage, selling locally fermented cider. ==History== Cider houses were once common selling a product that was usually fermented on the premises from apples grown in a local cider orchard. In the United States, the European colonists planted apple trees in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It was nine years after first landing at Plymouth in 1620. ‚ÄúThe Laird & Company Distillery in New Jersey‚Äù was the first distillery license issued in the United States, in 1780. The Industrial Revolution caused people to leave the orchards and move to the cities for work causing many orchards to be abandoned. This began the decline of Cider Houses in the late 1800s. ‚ÄúBy the time Prohibition was enacted in 1919, the production of cider in the U.S. had slipped to only 13 million gallons, down from 55 million gallons in 1899.‚Äù Because of changes in the taxation of cider in the early 1970s, and social changes, most cider houses now exist in name only. ‚ÄúToday, cider is one of the fastest-growing segments of the liquor industry‚Äù thus the emerge of more Cider Houses. With the popularity of Cider Houses, Cider Museums are emerging as well. At these museums, people can visit to learn the history of Cider and Cider Houses. Cider houses are common in Asturias, where they are called sidrer√≠as or chigres, and the Basque Country, where they are called sagardotegi. As cider has gained popularity during the 21st century, especially in countries such as Australia, 'bar & restaurant style' cider houses are opening; the Brunswick St Cider House in Melbourne is an example. A few do still exist in, for example, the West Country of the United Kingdom. (First published in CAMRA's Good Cider Guide, 2000.) As the popularity continues to grow, other Cider Houses and Museums are: The Cider Museum, The National Collection of Cider & Perry at Middle Farm, Bicton Countryside Museum, Woodchuck Cider House, Angry Orchard, Desert Cider House, 101 Cider House, Bristols Cider House, Carr's Ciderhouse, Downeast Cider House, Number Twelve Cider House, Lockhorn Cider House, Brooklyn Cider House, Slyboro Ciderhouse, Cottonwood Cider House, Redhead Ciderhouse, and West End Cider House just to name a few.

There are at least two definitions of \\"squircle\\" in use, the most common of which is based on the superellipse. The word \\"squircle\\" is a portmanteau of the words \\"square\\" and \\"circle\\". Squircles have been applied in design and optics. ==Superellipse-based squircle == In a Cartesian coordinate system, the superellipse is defined by the equation :\\\\left\\\\frac{x - a}{r_a}\\\\right^n\\\\\\\\! + \\\\left\\\\frac{y - b}{r_b}\\\\right^n\\\\\\\\! = 1,\\\\, where and are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, and are the and coordinates of the centre of the ellipse, and is a positive number. The squircle is then defined as the superellipse with and . Its equation is: : \\\\left( x - a \\\\right)^4 + \\\\left( y - b \\\\right)^4 = r^4 where is the minor radius of the squircle. Compare this to the equation of a circle. When the squircle is centred at the origin, then , and it is called Lam√©'s special quartic. The area inside the squircle can be expressed in terms of the gamma function as : \\\\mathrm{Area} = 4 r^2 \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\Gamma \\\\left(1+\\\\frac14\\\\right)\\\\right)^2}{\\\\Gamma \\\\left(1+\\\\frac24\\\\right)} = \\\\frac{8 r^2 \\\\left(\\\\Gamma \\\\left( \\\\frac54 \\\\right)\\\\right)^2 }{ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\pi } } = S \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\, r^2 \\\\approx 3.708\\\\, r^2, where is the minor radius of the squircle, and is the lemniscate constant. -norm notation In terms of the -norm on , the squircle can be expressed as: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{x}_c\\\\right\\\\_p = r where , is the vector denoting the centre of the squircle, and . Effectively, this is still a \\"circle\\" of points at a distance from the centre, but distance is defined differently. For comparison, the usual circle is the case , whereas the square is given by the case (the supremum norm), and a rotated square is given by (the taxicab norm). This allows a straightforward generalization to a spherical cube, or \\"sphube\\", in , or \\"hypersphubes\\" in higher dimensions. == Fern√°ndez‚ÄìGuasti squircle == Another squircle comes from work in optics. It may be called the Fern√°ndez‚ÄìGuasti squircle, after one of its authors, to distinguish it from the superellipse-related squircle above. This kind of squircle, centred at the origin, can be defined by the equation: : x^2 + y^2 - \\\\frac{s^2}{r^2} x^2 y^2 = r^2 where is the minor radius of the squircle, is the squareness parameter, and and are in the interval . If , the equation is a circle; if , this is a square. This equation allows a smooth parametrization of the transition from a circle to a square, without involving infinity. == Similar shapes == A squircle () compared with a rounded square (). [ (Larger image)] A shape similar to a squircle, called a rounded square, may be generated by separating four quarters of a circle and connecting their loose ends with straight lines, or by separating the four sides of a square and connecting them with quarter-circles. Such a shape is very similar but not identical to the squircle. Although constructing a rounded square may be conceptually and physically simpler, the squircle has the simpler equation and can be generalised much more easily. One consequence of this is that the squircle and other superellipses can be scaled up or down quite easily. This is useful where, for example, one wishes to create nested squircles. Various forms of a truncated circle Another similar shape is a truncated circle, the boundary of the intersection of the regions enclosed by a square and by a concentric circle whose diameter is both greater than the length of the side of the square and less than the length of the diagonal of the square (so that each figure has interior points that are not in the interior of the other). Such shapes lack the tangent continuity possessed by both superellipses and rounded squares. ==Uses== Squircles are useful in optics. If light is passed through a two-dimensional square aperture, the central spot in the diffraction pattern can be closely modelled by a squircle or supercircle. If a rectangular aperture is used, the spot can be approximated by a superellipse. Squircles have also been used to construct dinner plates. A squircular plate has a larger area (and can thus hold more food) than a circular one with the same radius, but still occupies the same amount of space in a rectangular or square cupboard. This is even more true of a square plate, but there are various problems (such as fragility, and difficulty of wiping up sauce) associated with the corners of square plates. Many Nokia phone models have been designed with a squircle-shaped touchpad button.Nokia Designer Mark Delaney mentions the squircle in a video regarding classic Nokia phone designs: Italian car manufacturer Fiat used numerous squircles in the interior and exterior design of the third generation Panda. Apple Inc. uses a shape that resembles a squircle as the shape of app icons in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (as of macOS Big Sur), but it is not actually a squircle but an approximation of a quintic superellipse. The same shape is seen on the home button in iOS devices with a home button but not Touch ID (currently only the iPod Touch). One of the shapes for adaptive icons available in the Android \\"Oreo\\" operating system is a squircle. The logo used by Instagram since 2016 includes a squircle forming the outline of a camera. ==See also== * Astroid * Ellipse * Ellipsoid * spaces * Oval * Squround * Superegg ==ReferencesExternal links== * Online Calculator for supercircle and super-ellipse * Web based supercircle generator Category:Geometric shapes Category:Curves Category:Algebraic curves ","title":"Squircle"},{"id":"5565336","text":"The Maidan Konstytutsii ( - Constitution Square) is a station on Kharkiv Metro's Kholodnohirsko‚ÄìZavodska Line.

Before the Istorychniy Muzei station's completion in 1984, a relief marble architectural item adorned with the hammer and sickle was located on the station. Inside the passenger transfer tunnel is the Kharkiv Metro's only public restroom, which is unlike the western European metro systems. Early during the planning stage, the station was to be called Tsentr, literally Centre, and to be built in the vicinity of the Tsentralny Restaurant. But because of the hydro-geological circumstances in the area, also affecting the construction of neighbouring stations, the station was moved to the northern end of the Constitution Square. Inside the cashier hall columns hold up the ceiling. They are made of marble blocks, the lower half being made of dark tones, gradually moving on into whiter tones. The station vestibule is lightened with luminescent lamps, put inside niches within the ceiling. The vestibule's area is 500 square meters, which due to the high passenger traffic, caused by the station being a transfer to another station. The Maidan Konstytutsii station is deep underground and is a pylon three-vaulted structure which is separated by arcades of the tracks. It was designed by V.A. Krasnolobov, N.P. Nikulin, and P.G. Chechelnitskiy; engineered by P.A. Bochikashvili, Y.E. Kryk and V.A. Tovalyuk; and decorated by D.G. Sova. The partitions the tracks have been held with are made of rose marble from Uzbekistan, and the arcades themselves have been finished with blank marble. The marble harmonizes with the floor which has been paved with red and black blocks of polished granite. Until the end of 1985, the station hall was lighted with lights placed inside original geometrical forms. In the next year, the geometrical lamp forms were replaced by different metal forms. In connection with the 350th anniversary of Kharkiv in 2003, the stations, including Ploshcha Konstytutsii, were lightened with brighter lamps. Until 20 November 2015 the station was named Radianska (in Russian, 'Sovietskaya').Landscapes of Communism: A History Through Buildings by Owen Hatherley; paperback published on 4 February 2016 by Penguin Books On that day the Kharkiv city council renamed the station to comply with decommunization laws.

The trial was much publicised in the newspapers of the day and labelled \\"the trial of the century\\". Lean's adaptation of the story starred his wife, Ann Todd, with Ivan Desny as her French lover. Norman Wooland played the respectable suitor and Leslie Banks the authoritarian father, both of whom are unaware of Madeleine's secret life. Lean made the film primarily as a \\"wedding present\\" to Todd, who had previously played the role onstage. He was never satisfied with the film and cited it as his least-favourite feature-length movie. ==Plot== The film dramatises events leading up to the 1857 trial of an otherwise-respectable young woman, Madeleine Smith (Ann Todd) for the murder of her draper's-assistant lover, Emile L'Angelier (Ivan Desny). The trial produced the uniquely Scottish verdict of \\"not proven\\", which left Madeleine a free woman. The film begins with the purchase of a house in Glasgow by an upper middle-class Victorian family. Their eldest daughter Madeleine claims the basement bedroom so she will have easy access to the servants' entrance and be able to entertain her lover, Frenchman Emile L'Angelier, without her family's knowledge. The relationship continues and the couple becomes secretly engaged but L'Angelier begins to press Madeleine to reveal his existence to her father, so they can marry. Frightened of her authoritarian father, Madeleine is reluctant to do so; eventually she visits L'Angelier in his room and says she will elope with him, rather than face telling her father. L'Angelier says he could never marry her this way and Madeleine realises that he loves her not for her but as a means to recover his position in society. She says their relationship is over and demands her letters to be returned. During the time that Madeleine has been seeing L'Angelier, her father has been encouraging her to accept the attentions of a wealthy society gentleman, William Minnoch (Norman Wooland) and after breaking her engagement with L'Angelier, Madeleine tells Mr. Minnoch that she will accept his marriage proposal. Her family is happy but L'Angelier shows up threatening to show her father the compromising letters in his possession, unless she continues to see him. Saying nothing of her new engagement, Madeleine reluctantly agrees. Some weeks later, L'Angelier becomes very ill. He recovers but later he has a fatal relapse. When the cause of death is proven to be arsenic poisoning, a friend of L'Angelier points the finger of suspicion at Madeleine, who is found to have had arsenic in her possession at the time of L'Angelier's death. The remainder of the film covers the court case, finishing with the verdict of \\"not proven\\", a uniquely Scottish verdict which releases Madeleine from custody as neither guilty nor not guilty. ==Cast== * Ann Todd as Madeleine Smith * Norman Wooland as William Minnoch * Ivan Desny as Emile L'Angelier * Leslie Banks as Mr. James Smith * Barbara Everest as Mrs. Smith * Susan Stranks as Janet Smith * Patricia Raine as Bessie Smith * Elizabeth Sellars as Christina Hackett * Edward Chapman as Dr. Thompson * Jean Cadell as Mrs. Jenkins * Eugene Deckers as Thuau * Andr√© Morell as Defending Counsel * Barry Jones as Prosecuting Counsel * Ivor Barnard as Mr. Murdoch * David Horne as Lord Justice-Clerk * Henry Edwards as Clerk of the Court * Amy Veness as Miss Aiken * Kynaston Reeves as Dr. Penny * Cameron Hall as Dr. Yeoman ==Production== Charles Bennett wrote a version of the story, meaning to direct but his script was not used because David Lean wanted to make a version starring his wife Ann Todd.Patrick McGilligan, \\"Charles Bennett\\", Backstory, p 40 ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1950 films Category:1950 crime drama films Category:British biographical films Category:British crime drama films Category:British films Category:Films directed by David Lean Category:Films set in 1857 Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films shot in Edinburgh Category:Films scored by William Alwyn Category:British historical films Category:1950s historical films Category:English-language films Category:1950 drama films ","title":"Madeleine (1950 film)"},{"id":"5565351","text":"International orange is a color used in the aerospace industry to set objects apart from their surroundings, similar to safety orange, but deeper and with a more reddish tone. ==Variations of international orange== Aerospace This is the shade used by NASA.

He graduated from Yakima Valley Community College and attended the University of Washington, but he ran out of money in 1937 and moved to Fairbanks, Alaska the following year. While in Fairbanks, he worked as a clerk in the Caterpillar department of Northern Commercial Company, serving the miners who worked the mining districts north of Fairbanks. One of these miners, Bob Bartlett, would later become his father-in-law. During World War II, he served in the United States Army Air Forces as a courier in the Pacific Theater of Operations. After leaving the armed forces, Riley returned to Alaska, moving to Juneau. He passed the Alaska Territory's bar examination, and was later appointed assistant to territorial Governor Ernest Gruening. Later in the Gruening administration, Riley became the Secretary of Alaska (which evolved into the present-day position of Lieutenant Governor of Alaska) from 1952 to 1953. This position, like that of the territorial governor, was appointed by the President of the United States. His term was cut short with the change of command from Harry S. Truman to Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1954, Riley was elected to the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives, serving two terms. He was one of a handful of sitting legislators who were elected as delegates to Alaska's Constitutional Convention. In the latter position, he served as the Chair of the Committee on Rules, and a member of the Committee on Resources. After statehood in 1959, he was the executive assistant to the state's first governor, William A. Egan.

A fixed odds betting terminal (FOBT, sometimes pronounced \\"fob-tee\\") is a type of electronic slot machine normally found in betting shops in the United Kingdom and introduced in 2001. The terminals allow players to bet on the outcome of various games and events which have fixed odds, with the theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) displayed on the machine by law.http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for- gambling-businesses/Compliance/Sector-specific-compliance/Arcades-and- machines/Gaming-machine-categories/B2-gaming-machines.aspx Like all casino games, the \\"house\\" (i.e. the betting shop) has a built-in advantage. Typically, slot machine FOBTs have an RTP of 90% to 94% depending on the chosen stake, and standard roulette FOBTs have a long-term average RTP of 97%. The most commonly played game is roulette. The minimum amount wagered per spin is ¬£1 and the maximum is ¬£100. The largest single payout cannot exceed ¬£500 and this can limit the wager size e.g. the maximum wager on a single number on roulette at odds of 35:1 is ¬£14. Token coins can be of value as low as five pence in some UK licensed betting offices (LBOs). Other games include bingo, simulated horseracing and greyhound racing, and a range of slot machine games. In May 2018, the national government agreed with a reform campaign to cut the maximum bet for some games from ¬£100 to ¬£2. The terminals allegedly lead some players into problem gambling. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced the policy change, which requires legislation in Parliament.Davies, Rob (17 May 2018) \\"Maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals cut to ¬£2\\".

They have been dubbed the \\"crack cocaine\\" of gambling by critics. In response to this criticism, in 2014 bookmakers represented by the Association of British Bookmakers introduced the facility for customers to set time and money limits when using FOBTs.BBC News https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26378026 In October 2017, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport began studying the possibility of reducing the ¬£100 maximum bet limit and a decision was made in May 2018 to limit the maximum bet to ¬£2. This new maximum bet limit came into effect on 1 April 2019. Multiple bookmakers argued that the resultant loss of revenue could force them to downsize their high street operations (with the industry estimating that 2,100 shops could be collectively closed): in July 2019, William Hill announced plans to close 700 shops, primarily citing the new regulation. MP Tracey Crouch countered these arguments, noting that industry statistics showed downward trends in revenue from physical betting shops in favour of online betting, even before the restriction came into effect. Scotland As a result of the Scottish Referendum on Independence on 18 September 2014, The Smith Commission convened, led by Lord Smith of Kelvin KT. On 27 November 2014 the Report of the Smith Commission for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament was published. Page 22 under the heading \\"Betting, Gaming and Lotteries\\" states \\"The Scottish Parliament will have the power to prevent the proliferation of Fixed-Odds Betting Terminals\\". All five main parties (SNP, Greens, Conservative, Labour, Liberal) agreed the terms of the report. Devolution of this power to the Scottish Parliament will be enacted through the UK parliament in due course. Page 11 of the report states: \\"The UK government has undertaken to produce draft clauses implementing\\" ... this and ... \\"will publish these clauses by 25th Jan 2015\\". Northern Ireland There are over 900 FOBTs in operation in Northern Ireland, but campaign group Fairer Gambling argues that they may not be legal under Northern Irish law, as the Gambling Act 2005 only applies in England, Wales and Scotland.

This contrasts with parenteral nutrition or drug administration (Greek para, \\"besides\\" + enteros), which occurs from routes outside the GI tract, such as intravenous routes. Enteral administration involves the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines (i.e., the gastrointestinal tract).

It is based on the 1916 play of the same name by Harold Brighouse. It stars Charles Laughton in the role of Victorian bootmaker Henry Hobson, Brenda De Banzie as his eldest daughter and John Mills as a timid employee. The film also features Prunella Scales in one of her first cinema roles as Vicky. Hobson's Choice won the British Academy Film Award for Best British Film 1954. ==Plot== Willie Mossop (John Mills) is a gifted but unappreciated bootmaker employed by the tyrannical Henry Horatio Hobson (Charles Laughton) in his moderately upmarket shop in 1880 Salford in Lancashire. Hard-drinking widower Hobson has three daughters. Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) and her younger sisters Alice (Daphne Anderson) and Vicky (Prunella Scales) have worked in their father's establishment without wages and are eager to be married and free of the shop. Alice has been seeing Albert Prosser (Richard Wattis), a young up-and-coming solicitor, while Vicky prefers Freddy Beenstock (Derek Blomfield), the son of a respectable corn merchant. Hobson does not object to losing Alice and Vicky, but Maggie is far too useful to part with. To his friends, he mocks the plain, severe Maggie as a spinster \\"a bit on the ripe side\\" at 30 years of age. Her pride injured, Maggie bullies the browbeaten, unambitious Willie into an engagement. They go to Peel Park to arrange it, and Willie says he is already engaged to the daughter of his landlady. Maggie goes to his house to embarrassingly resolve the issue. She walks him out telling him never to return. She tells him to kiss her but he feels this is improper. She tells Mr Hobson of the plan and he strongly disapproves. He tells Willie that he will \\"beat the love\\" out of him with his belt. Willie declares he has no love but if he tries to belt him he will stick to Maggie like glue. He hits him and they leave to set up their own business. They go to Mrs Hepworth to borrow ¬£100 giving Willie himself as security. With money in hand, they are married, and between Maggie's business sense and Willie's shoemaking genius, the enterprise is successful. Within a year, they have not only paid off their business loan, but have also taken away nearly all of Hobson's clientele. Under Maggie's tutelage, the formerly meek and illiterate Willie has become an educated, self-confident man of business, and he and Maggie have fallen deeply in love. Back in the Moonraker Inn Hobson drinks too much and starts insulting all his drinking buddies. He walks home staring at the reflection of the moon in the puddles and in the windows. He falls several times then falls into the basement of Beenstock & Co through their trapdoor. He is found sleeping there the next day. He is served with a notice for trespass and damage. He fails to attend the wedding of Willie and Maggie. It is attended by the sisters and their fiancees. They have a wedding meal in the basement of Willie's new shop. Hobson appears just after the meal. He is told that Prosser, the solicitor suing him is there as is young Beenstock, the suer. Maggie bargains the settlement down from ¬£1000 to ¬£500. Hobson then realises he has been tricked: the money is the wedding settlement for the two younger sisters. Willie dreads his wedding night but emerges a changed man. The next morning the shop makes its first sale: a pair of shoelaces for one penny. They are ecstatic. By New Years Eve Willie has paid off the ¬£100 plus ¬£20 interest to Mrs Hepworth. On New Year's Day Hobson is hallucinating of giant mice. The doctor is sent for. Dr. MacFarlane (John Laurie) examines Hobson and diagnoses \\"chronic alcoholism\\". He sends for Maggie. Maggie clears the house of alcohol. The bottles leave as the sisters arrive. They think there is shame in letting the neighbours see this but Maggie says that the whole street knows anyway. Will arrives and checks the stock. He treats the sisters as equals for the first time and they are shocked by his loss of subservience. Mossop is offered his old job back but insists on a partnership with Hobson. Moreover he insists it is called \\"Mossop & Hobson\\" rather than \\"Hobson & Mossop\\". Hobson becomes a silent partner. Willie offers to change Maggie's brass wedding ring for gold, but she wants to keep the ring she has. ==Cast== *Charles Laughton as Henry Horatio Hobson *John Mills as Will Mossop *Brenda De Banzie as Maggie Hobson *Daphne Anderson as Alice Hobson *Prunella Scales as Vicky Hobson *Richard Wattis as Albert Prosser *Derek Blomfield as Freddy Beenstock *Helen Haye as Mrs. Hepworth, the financial backer *Raymond Huntley as Nathaniel Beenstock *Jack Howarth as Tubby Wadlow, another Hobson employee *Joseph Tomelty as Jim Heeler *Julien Mitchell as Sam Minns, the publican *Gibb McLaughlin as Tudsbury *Philip Stainton as Denton *John Laurie as Dr. MacFarlane *Dorothy Gordon as Ada Figgins *Madge Brindley as Mrs Figgins ==Production== Robert Donat was originally cast in the role of Will Mossop but had to pull out due to his asthma. The outdoor location scenes were filmed around the Salford area with Peel Park serving as the courting place for Maggie Hobson and William Mossop. ==Soundtrack== Malcolm Arnold took the comical main theme for the film from his opera The Dancing Master. Throughout the film, it is linked to Hobson so often that he even whistles it at one point. Arnold wrote the score for a small pit orchestra of 22 players, and he enlisted the help of a Belgian cafe owner to play the musical saw for one pivotal scene. After a night of drinking at The Moonraker, Hobson is seeing double, and he fixates on the reflection of the moon in the puddles outside the pub. Arnold deploys the musical saw to represent the willowy allure of the moon, as the clumsy Hobson stomps from puddle to puddle, chasing its reflection.Jackson, Paul R.W.

Critical In his New York Times review, Bosley Crowther called Hobson's Choice \\"a delightful and rewarding British film\\", and praised the performances of the three leads and its producer/director. TV Guide gave the film four stars, characterising it as \\"a fully developed comedy of human foibles and follies with Laughton rendering a masterful, sly performance, beautifully supported by de Banzie and Mills.\\" In the opinion of Daniel Etherington of Channel 4, the \\"character interactions between the couple and the old bugger of a dad are fascinating, funny and moving.\\" His verdict is, \\"Displays the Lean mark of quality and sterling work from its leads.

Of her surgery, Mudge said: \\"I'd worn away all my knee cartilage ‚Äì more to do with my running style than the sport itself. I was running on the bare bone of my femur, so the surgeon drilled a lot of holes, which stimulates scar tissue, and eventually, I could run again. My knee was more painful afterwards than before. I was prepared for that, but was allowed to run for only ten minutes even months after the operation. I deliberately did not ask about the success or failure rate in order to keep a positive frame of mind. It was only six months later that a physiotherapist told me there were lots of people for whom the operation did not work.\\" On her return from injury, she won three races in Switzerland and placed second in their National Championship. Her prizes included a large raclette cheese and a CHF50 voucher for a local florist. She had to decline the latter, as she had no place for a vase of flowers‚Äîshe lives in a tent when touring the circuit, cooking over a gas stove and travelling to events by bicycle.

He had a variety of jobs during his early life: town clerk, police officer, and Royal Air Force pilot. He was made a prisoner of war during World War II after being shot down over Norway. It was during this period, while incarcerated in Stalag Luft III, that he started to write. Peter Butterworth was in the same camp and the two became firm friends, with Rothwell mostly writing and Butterworth performing for camp concerts. This helped to relieve the boredom of camp life and the noise of the concerts helped cover tunnelling escape efforts. After World War II Rothwell took up writing as his profession, writing scripts for The Crazy Gang, Arthur Askey, Ted Ray and Terry-Thomas. By the time he submitted a screenplay to Carry On films producer Peter Rogers, he was already an established screenwriter. The first screenplay he submitted, on spec, to series producer Peter Rogers was Carry On Jack, although the first of his screenplays to be filmed was 'Call me a Cab'. It went on to be renamed Carry On Cabby. Peter Rogers liked Rothwell's writing so much that he asked him to become the Carry On staff writer; Rothwell went on to write a further nineteen Carry On films. He took the genre into a more lewd and bawdy direction from that of Carry On's first screenwriter, Norman Hudis, but he was careful never to stray into pornography. He saw the films as a continuation of music hall entertainment, Max Miller being a hero of his. Rothwell also wrote several Carry On TV specials for Christmas, and the first series of Up Pompeii! starring Frankie Howerd. Rothwell was awarded the OBE in 1977 for his services to the cinema industry. In the late 1970s he retired due to a prolonged illness. He spent his final years in Worthing, and died aged 64. In April 2007, Rothwell's line \\"Infamy! Infamy! They've all got it in for me!\\" (delivered by Kenneth Williams in Carry On Cleo) was voted the greatest one-liner in movie history by a thousand comedy writers, actors, impresarios and members of the public for the launch of Sky Movies Comedy Channel. Rothwell \\"borrowed\\" the line (with permission) from Frank Muir and Denis Norden, who had used it on their radio show Take It From Here. ==Selected filmography== * Is Your Honeymoon Really Necessary?

The recording of the album finished in April 2006 and it was released on September 12 in the UK and September 12, 2006 in North America through Reprise Records. The album in full could be streamed at the band's MySpace page a few days prior to the release. Like Mastodon's previous studio work Leviathan, Blood Mountain is a concept album. According to bassist Troy Sanders, \\"It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle.\\" Guitarist Bill Kelliher considers this album to represent the earth element. At the time, bassist Troy Sanders called it \\"sonically the best album we have done.\\" The band's emphasis on clean, melodic vocals instead of the harsher vocals that the band used on their early work continues to grow on this album. The album includes guest appearances by Scott Kelly of Neurosis on \\"Crystal Skull\\", Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age on \\"Colony of Birchmen\\", as well as keyboard player Isaiah \\"Ikey\\" Owens of The Mars Volta and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala of At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta on \\"Pendulous Skin\\" and \\"Siberian Divide\\", respectively. ==Story notes== * The main character is in search of the Crystal Skull which he hopes to place at the top of Blood Mountain. In the making of DVD, the Crystal Skull is supposed to remove \\"the reptilian brain\\" causing its owner the ability to achieve the next step of human evolution.The Making Of Blood Mountain DVD Chapter 8 * In an interview with bass guitarist Troy Sanders it was revealed that a Cysquatch is \\"a one- eyed Sasquatch that can see into the future.\\" The Cysquatch warns the main character of the following dangers during his journey for the Crystal Skull.Track 5: Circle Of Cysquatch * Several of the lyrics in \\"The Wolf is Loose\\" refer to chapter titles and themes in Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces. The main character may be an example of a monomythical hero. ==Track details== The album's last song, \\"Pendulous Skin\\", contains a secret \\"fan letter\\" from Josh Homme, who provided guest vocals on the album. At minute 21:25, he says: \\"Dear Mastodon: My name is Joshua. I'm a big fan from Southern Cal. Really diggin' on your new scene. That's why I hope you don't mind when I got your new demos for your new CD, I had to sing parts on them and send them to you as a tribute. I hope you're not mad about me also uploading them onto the Internet. But hell, it seems like you guys are so cool that you might dig something just like that. Sincerely, your fan, Joshua M. Homme. P.S., Keep it real...REAL (studio effects are used)....*laughter*....REAL.\\" When asked about the message in a Pitchfork Media interview, Homme said, \\"I was just fucking with them. Then they asked if they could put that on the end of their record, and I was like, 'Yeah.' I did the vocal [for \\"Colony of Birchmen\\"] and sent it back to them, and that message was before the song started.\\"Pitchfork: QOTSA's Homme Talks New LP, Motivations, Pirates The song itself ends at 5:03, followed by over 16 minutes of silence, then Homme's message.

The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) is a visible-infrared spectrometer aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter searching for mineralogic indications of past and present water on Mars. The CRISM instrument team comprises scientists from over ten universities and led by principal investigator Scott Murchie. CRISM was designed, built, and tested by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. ==Objectives== CRISM is being used to identify locations on Mars that may have hosted water, a solvent considered important in the search for past or present life on Mars. In order to do this, CRISM is mapping the presence of minerals and chemicals that may indicate past interaction with water - low-temperature or hydrothermal. These materials include iron and oxides, which can be chemically altered by water, and phyllosilicates and carbonates, which form in the presence of water. All of these materials have characteristic patterns in their visible-infrared reflections and are readily seen by CRISM. In addition, CRISM is monitoring ice and dust particulates in the Martian atmosphere to learn more about its climate and seasons. ==Instrument overview== CRISM measures visible and infrared electromagnetic radiation from 370 to 3920 nanometers in 6.55 nanometer increments. The instrument has two modes, a multispectral untargeted mode and a hyperspectral targeted mode. In the untargeted mode, CRISM reconnoiters Mars, recording approximately 50 of its 544 measurable wavelengths at a resolution of 100 to 200 meters per pixel. In this mode CRISM will map half of Mars within a few months after aerobraking and most of the planet after one year. The objective of this mode is to identify new scientifically interesting locations that could be further investigated. In targeted mode, the spectrometer measures energy in all 544 wavelengths. When the MRO spacecraft is at an altitude of 300 km, CRISM detects a narrow but long strip on the Martian surface about 18 kilometers across and 10,800 kilometers long. The instrument sweeps this strip across the surface as MRO orbits Mars to image the surface. ==Instrument design== A diagram of the CRISM instrument. The data collecting part of CRISM is called the Optical Sensor Unit (OSU) and consists of two spectrographs, one that detects visible light from 400 to 830 nm and one that detects infrared light from 830 to 4050 nm. The infrared detector is cooled to ‚Äì173¬∞ Celsius (‚Äì280¬∞ Fahrenheit) by a radiator plate and three cryogenic coolers. While in targeted mode, the instrument gimbals in order to continue pointing at one area even though the MRO spacecraft is moving. The extra time collecting data over a targeted area increases the signal to noise ratio as well as the spatial and spectral resolution of the image. This scanning ability also allows the instrument to perform emission phase functions, viewing the same surface through variable amounts of atmosphere, which can be used to determine atmospheric properties. The Data Processing Unit (DPU) of CRISM performs in- flight data processing including compressing the data before transmission. ==Investigations== CRISM began its exploration of Mars in late 2006. Results from the OMEGA visible/near-infrared spectrometer on Mars Express (2003‚Äìpresent), the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER; 2003‚Äìpresent), the TES thermal emission spectrometer on Mars Global Surveyor (MGS; 1997-2006), and the THEMIS thermal imaging system on Mars Odyssey (2004‚Äìpresent) helped to frame the themes for CRISM's exploration: * Where and when did Mars have persistently wet environments? * What is the composition of Mars' crust? * What are the characteristics of Mars' modern climate? In November 2018, it was announced that CRISM had fabricated some additional pixels representing the minerals alunite, kieserite, serpentine and perchlorate.An orbiter glitch may mean some signs of liquid water on Mars aren't real. Lisa Grossman, Science News, 21 November 2018. The instrument team found that some false positives were caused by a filtering step when the detector switches from a high luminosity area to shadows. Reportedly, 0.05% of the pixels were indicating perchlorate, now known to be a false high estimate by this instrument. However, both the Phoenix lander and the Curiosity rover measured 0.5% perchlorates in the soil, suggesting a global distribution of these salts. Perchlorate is of interest to astrobiologists, as it sequesters water molecules from the atmosphere and reduces its freezing point, potentially creating thin films of watery brine that ‚Äîalthough toxic to most Earth life‚Äî it could potentially offer habitats for native Martian microbes in the shallow subsurface. (See: Life on Mars#Perchlorates) Persistently wet environments Aqueous minerals are minerals that form in water, either by chemical alteration of pre-existing rock or by precipitation out of solution. The minerals indicate where liquid water existed long enough to react chemically with rock. Which minerals form depends on temperature, salinity, pH, and composition of the parent rock. Which aqueous minerals are present on Mars therefore provides important clues to understanding past environments. The OMEGA spectrometer on the Mars Express orbiter and the MER rovers both uncovered evidence for aqueous minerals. OMEGA revealed two distinct kinds of past aqueous deposits. The first, containing sulfates such as gypsum and kieserite, is found in layered deposits of Hesperian age (Martian middle age, roughly from 3.7 to 3 billion years ago). The second, rich in several different kinds of phyllosilicates, instead occurs rocks of Noachian age (older than about 3.7 billion years). The different ages and mineral chemistries suggest an early water-rich environment in which phyllosilicates formed, followed by a dryer, more saline and acidic environment in which sulfates formed. The MER Opportunity rover spent years exploring sedimentary rocks formed in the latter environment, full of sulfates, salts, and oxidized iron minerals. Soil forms from parent rocks through physical disintegration of rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals can reveal if the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty. Because CRISM is able to detect many minerals in the soil or regolith, the instrument is being used to help decipher ancient Martian environments. CRISM has found a characteristic layering pattern of aluminum-rich clays overlying iron- and magnesium-rich clays in many areas scattered through Mars' highlands. Surrounding Mawrth Vallis, these \\"layered clays\\" cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometers.Noe Dobrea et al. 2010. JGR 115, E00D19Michalski, Noe Dobrea. 2007. Geol. 35, 10.Michalski et al. 2010. Astrobio. 10, 687-703. Similar layering occurs near the Isidis basin, in the Noachian plains surrounding Valles Marineris, and in Noachian plains surrounding the Tharsis plateau. The global distribution of layered clays suggests a global process. Layered clays are late Noachian in age, dating from the same time as water-carved valley networks. The layered clay composition is similar to what is expected for soil formation on Earth - a weathered upper layer leached of soluble iron and magnesium, leaving an insoluble aluminum-rich residue, with a lower layer that still retains its iron and magnesium. Some researchers have suggested that the Martian clay \\"layer cake\\" was created by soil-forming processes, including rainfall, at the time that valley networks formed. The delta in Eberswalde crater, as imaged by MOC Lake and marine environments on Earth are favorable for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments they left behind are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers helps us to understand the sequence of events that formed the sedimentary rocks. The Mars Orbiter Camera found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors (alluvial fans) or in crater lakes (deltas). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPMMilliken, R. and T. Bish. 2010. Sources and sinks of clay minerals on Mars. Philosophical Magazine: 90. 2293-2308 More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved. Not all ancient Martian lakes were fed by inflowing valley networks. CRISM discovered several craters on the western slope of Tharsis that contain \\"bathtub rings\\" of sulfate minerals and a kind of phyllosilicate called kaolinite. Both minerals can form together by precipitating out of acidic, saline water. These craters lack inflowing valley networks, showing that they were not fed by rivers - instead, they must have been fed by inflowing groundwater. HiRISE image of the \\"Home Plate\\" rock outcrop The identification of hot spring deposits was a priority for CRISM, because hot springs would have had energy (geothermal heat) and water, two basic requirements for life. One of the signatures of hot springs on Earth is deposits of silica. The MER Spirit rover explored a silica-rich deposit called \\"Home Plate\\" that is thought to have formed in a hot spring. CRISM has discovered other silica-rich deposits in many locations. Some are associated with central peaks of impact craters, which are sites of heating driven by meteor impact. Silica has also been identified on the flanks of volcanic inside the caldera of the Syrtis Major shield volcano, forming light-colored mounds that look like scaled-up versions of Home Plate. Elsewhere, in the westernmost parts of Valles Marineris, near the core of the Tharsis volcanic province, there are sulfate and clay deposits suggestive of \\"warm\\" springs. Hot spring deposits are one of the most promising areas on Mars to search for evidence for past life.Nili Fossae on Mars - largest known carbonate deposit. One of the leading hypotheses for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, to try to solve this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in Nili Fossae in 2008. Soon thereafter, landed missions to Mars started identifying carbonates on the surface; the Phoenix Mars lander found between 3‚Äì5 wt% calcite (CaCO3) at its northern lowland landing site, while the MER Spirit rover identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16‚Äì34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Later CRISM analyses identified carbonates in the rim of Huygens crater which suggested that there could be extensive deposits of buried carbonates on Mars.Some of Mars' Missing Carbon Dioxide May be Buried However, a study by CRISM scientists estimated that all of the carbonate rock on Mars holds less that the present Martian atmosphere worth of carbon dioxide. They determined that if a dense ancient Martian atmosphere did exist, it is probably not trapped in the crust. Crustal composition Understanding the composition of Mars' crust and how it changed with time tells us about many aspects of Mars' evolution as a planet, and is a major goal of CRISM. Remote and landed measurements prior to CRISM, and analysis of Martian meteorites, all suggest that the Martian crust is made mostly of basaltic igneous rock composed mostly of feldspar and pyroxene. Images from the Mars Orbiter Camera on MGS showed that in some places the upper few kilometers of the crust is composed of hundreds of thin volcanic lava flows. TES and THEMIS both found mostly basaltic igneous rock, with scattered olivine-rich and even some quartz-rich rocks. The first recognition of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars came from the Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates. Both class of minerals are signatures of sedimentary rocks. CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for other deposits of sedimentary rock on Mars' surface, and for layers of sedimentary rock buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust. Modern climates To understand Mars' ancient climate, and whether it might have created environments habitable for life, first we need to understand Mars' climate today. Each mission to Mars has made new advances in understanding its climate. Mars has seasonal variations in the abundances of water vapor, water ice clouds and hazes, and atmospheric dust. During southern summer, when Mars is closest to the Sun (at perihelion), solar heating can raise massive dust storms. Regional dust storms - ones having a 1000-kilometer scale - show surprising repeatability Mars-year to Mars-year. Once every decade or so, they grow into global-scale events. In contrast, during northern summer when Mars is furthest from the Sun (at aphelion), there is an equatorial water-ice cloud belt and very little dust in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor varies in abundance seasonally, with the greatest abundances in each hemisphere's summer after the seasonal polar caps have sublimated into the atmosphere. During winter, both water and carbon dioxide frost and ices form on Mars' surface. These ices form the seasonal and residual polar caps. The seasonal caps - which form each autumn and sublimate each spring - are dominated by carbon dioxide ice. The residual caps - which persist year after year - consist mostly of water ice at the north pole and water ice with a thin veneer (a few 10's of meters thick) of carbon dioxide ice at the south pole. Mars' atmosphere is so thin and wispy that solar heating of dust and ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20‚Äì30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface. The south polar seasonal cap has a bizarre variety of bright and dark streaks and spots that appear during spring, as carbon dioxide ice sublimates. Prior to MRO there were various ideas for processes that could form these strange features, a leading model being carbon dioxide geysers.Manrubia, S. C.; O. Prieto Ballesteros; C. Gonz√°lez Kessler; D. Fern√°ndez Remolar; C. C√≥rdoba-Jabonero; F. Selsis; S. B√©rczi; T. G√°nti; A. Horv√°th; A. Sik; E. Szathm√°ry (2004). \\"Comparative Analysis of Geological Features and Seasonal Processes in Inca City and PittyUSA Patera Regions on Mars\\" (PDF). European Space Agency Publications (ESA SP): 545. CRISM has watched the dark spots grow during southern spring, and found that bright streaks forming alongside the dark spots are made of fresh, new carbon dioxide frost, pointing like arrows back to their sources - the same sources as the dark spots. The bright streaks probably form by expansion, cooling, and freezing of the carbon dioxide gas, forming a \\"smoking gun\\" to support the geyser hypothesis. ==See also== *Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery (another Spectrometer in Mars orbit since 2016, on ExoMars) *Ralph (New Horizons) (imaging spectrometer on New Horizons) ==ReferencesExternal links== * CRISM official website * Browse Map of Images from JHUAPL.

It was first described in 1952 by Comfort and Steinberg but it was not until 1996 that Whitcomb et al isolated the first responsible mutation in the trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) on the long arm of chromosome seven (7q35). The term \\"hereditary pancreatitis\\" is used when a genetic biomarker is identified, and \\"familial pancreatitis\\" otherwise. ==Presentation== HP is characterised by attacks of epigastric pain, which are often associated with nausea and vomiting. Symptoms may start shortly after birth but onset varies periodically, with some patients not exhibiting symptoms until adulthood. There is usually progression to chronic pancreatitis with endocrine and exocrine failure and a mortally increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Lifetime risk of cancer has been variously calculated as 35‚Äì54% to the age of 75 years and screening for early pancreatic cancer is being offered to HP sufferers on a scientific basis. Some patients may choose to have their pancreas surgically removed to prevent pancreatic cancer from developing in the future. The epidemiology of HP follows a similar pattern to alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis, but there are important differences. For example, HP typically has an earlier age of pancreatitis onset; although malabsorption and diabetes mellitus occur at a later stage in the disease progression. == Genetics == The vast majority of the cases of HP are caused by substitutions, at base 365 (c.365G>A) and base 86 of the cDNA (c.86A>T) on the PRSS1 gene. The nucleotide substitutions were discovered in the late 1990s by classical linkage analysis and are now known as p.R122H and p.N29I respectively, according to the amino acid substitution and position in the protein sequence. These mutations are rarely identified in general screens of patients with idiopathic disease and the phenotype of p.R122H and p.N29I is now well characterised with the p.A16V mutation recently characterised for the first time. There are many other rare mutations or polymorphisms of PRSS1 which remain less well understood and not all HP families have had the responsible genetic mutation identified. The mechanism by which these genetic mutations cause pancreatitis is not yet known; but is likely to be the result of increased autoactivation or reduced deactivation of trypsinogen. However, a novel mechanism has recently been identified in a p.R116C kindred. ==Diagnosis== Families are defined as having HP, if the phenotype is consistent with highly penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance. In simple terms, this would require two or more first degree relatives (or three or more second degree relatives) to have unexplained recurrent-acute or chronic pancreatitis in two or more generations. It is an autosomal dominant disease with penetrance that is generally accepted to be ‚âà80%. ==Management== Treatment of HP resemble that of chronic pancreatitis of other causes. Treatment focuses on enzyme and nutritional supplementation, pain management, pancreatic diabetes, and local organ complications, such as pseudocysts, bile duct or duodenal obstruction.(PMC1774562) == Prognosis == A 2009 study which followed 189 patients found no excess mortality despite the increased risk of pancreatic cancer. ==References External links == Category:Congenital disorders of digestive system Category:Pancreas disorders Category:Pancreatic cancer ","title":"Hereditary pancreatitis"},{"id":"5565462","text":"\\"Clerk Colvill\\" is Child ballad 42.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"Clerk Colvill\\" This ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in Ballads Weird and Wonderful (1912) where it was illustrated by Vernon Hill. ==Synopsis== Clerk Colvill, ignoring the advice of his lady or his mother, goes to a body of water, where a mermaid seduces him.

In 1610, at the age of 17, Charles arrived at Port-Royal in Acadia with his father in an expedition led by Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt who had been one of the original settlers in 1604 at Saint Croix Island, Maine before they moved in 1605 to their permanent settlement at Port-Royal. The habitation had been previously abandoned in 1607 by Biencourt de Poutrincourt and others due to financial troubles. The 1610 expedition also included Poutrincourt's 19-year-old son Charles de Biencourt de Saint-Just and a Catholic priest who set about the task of baptizing the local Mi'kmaq people, including their chief Membertou. In 1613, the habitation at Port-Royal was attacked by Virginia colonists led by Captain Samuel Argall. Several settlers were killed, others taken prisoner and the fort and goods were destroyed. Poutrincourt who had wintered in France to gather supplies returned to Port Royal the next spring. He was forced to return to France with the surviving settlers, and left his interest in the colony to his son. The young Biencourt and Charles de la Tour remained, living amongst the Mi'kmaq and engaging in the fur industry. Charles de Biencourt died in 1623 and left La Tour as his heir, though this was not recognized by the French crown. La Tour took charge of the colony and migrated from Port- Royal to establish himself at Cap de Sable (present-day Port La Tour, Nova Scotia), building a strong post called Fort Lomeron in honor of David Lomeron who was his agent in France. Soon after, La Tour married a woman from the Mi'kmaq tribe and started a family. With the onset of the Anglo-French War of 1627‚Äì29, Charles de La Tour knew he had to strengthen defenses if Acadia were to remain French. He wrote letters to King Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, that were presented by his father Claude, requesting supplies and reinforcements, as well as a proper commission authorizing him to defend the area. Reinforcements were sent in the spring of 1628, however the ships were captured by the English under the command of Sir David Kirke, and the crew, including La Tour's father, were sent as prisoners to England. With the fall of Quebec to the English in 1629, the sole French stronghold left in New France was La Tour's Fort Lomeron. After his capture, Claude de La Tour made an alliance with the English and promised to win over his son, in exchange for being made a baronet of Nova Scotia and a large grant of land. When Charles was pressed by his father to surrender the fort he refused, stating that \\"he would rather die than betray his King.\\" Upon La Tour's refusal, Claude de La Tour led English troops in an unsuccessful attack on Fort Lomeron. ==Governor of Acadia== In 1631, La Tour was formally granted a commission by King Louis XIII naming him lieutenant-general and governor of Acadia. He then relocated to the mouth of the Saint John River in present-day Saint John, New Brunswick where he built a new fort called Fort Sainte-Marie (later named Fort La Tour). The setting was described by historian M.A. MacDonald: The following year with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, all the lands that had been seized by the British were returned to France including Acadia. In addition, Cardinal Richelieu sent his cousin, Isaac de Razilly, as the new lieutenant-general of all New France and governor of Acadia, conflicting with La Tour's commission from the prior year. La Tour and Razilly agreed to divide control of Acadia, the latter controlling La H√®ve, Port-Royal, and the Saint Croix area, while La Tour was given authority over Cap de Sable and the Saint John River, headquartered at Fort Sainte-Marie. Razilly unexpectedly died in 1635, and the amicable relationship the two leaders shared did not extend to his successor, Charles de Menou d'Aulnay. By 1639, Charles de La Tour's wife had died leaving three daughters, and realizing he needed a male heir to bolster his claim, set about contracting for a new wife. His sights fell on Huguenot Fran√ßoise-Marie Jacquelin and a marriage contract was signed on 31 December 1639. The contract authorized Jacquelin kept all her property and anything that she might inherit. She was also entitled to a half share of anything that she or her husband acquired during their marriage, and as a widow she would be entitled to half her husband's estate, with an inheritance fund and she would be the guardian of any children. Upon arriving in Port-Royal in June 1640, the couple married and moved to Fort Sainte-Marie. ==Acadian Civil War== Monument to Fort LaTour, Saint John, New Brunswick In July 1640, Charles de La Tour and Charles de Menou d'Aulnay began a series of violent and costly confrontations that would last for the next five years. Hostilities continued to escalate and by 1642 d'Aulnay managed to get La Tour charged with treason and disrespect to the French Crown. Knowing he would be imprisoned if he were to return to France, La Tour sent his wife, Fran√ßoise-Marie, to advocate on his behalf which she did skillfully. She was allowed to return to Acadia with a warship to help her husband defend himself. In the Spring of 1643, La Tour led a party of English mercenaries against the Acadian colony at Port-Royal. His 270 Puritan and Huguenot troops killed three, burned a mill, slaughtered cattle and seized 18,000 livres of furs. In 1645, while La Tour was in Boston seeking reinforcements and drumming up more support for his cause, d'Aulnay retaliated by seizing all of La Tour's possessions and outposts, especially Fort La Tour at Saint John and Cap de Sable.Faragher, John Mack. A Great and Noble Scheme (WW Norton, New York, 2005) pp. 52-59 In the Battle of Saint John, La Tour's wife defended the fort for three days. On the fourth day despite losing 33 men, d'Aulnay was able to breach the fort, and La Tour's men were sent to the gallows, forcing Fran√ßoise-Marie to watch with a rope around her own neck. Three weeks later she died at age 43 while a prisoner as documented by Nicolas Denys' letters and journals of the drama. Upon learning of his wife's death, and the loss of all his possessions, La Tour sought refuge at the Chateau Saint-Louis in Quebec City where he was welcomed by Governor Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny, and d'Aulnay became the sole governor of Acadia.Denys, Nicolas. The Description and Natural History of the Coasts of North America, ed. and trans. William F. Ganong (Champlain Society, Toronto, 1908) ==Later years and death== During the next four years while in exile in Quebec, Charles de La Tour continued in the fur trade, assisted the Jesuits in their missionary efforts, and occasionally fought with the Hurons against the Iroquois. In 1650, d'Aulnay died when his canoe capsized. La Tour promptly returned to France to plead his case and was successfully rehabilitated in the royal favor, as well as having his property and his commission as governor being restored. He returned to Acadia in 1653, along with several new colonist families including his friend Philippe Mius d'Entremont, to whom he awarded one of the few fiefs to constitute territory in North America. In an effort to bring an end to the rivalry between the La Tour and d'Aulnay faction, Charles de La Tour married a third time to Jeanne Motin, the widow of his former enemy in 24 February 1653. In 1654, an English expedition under the command of Major General Robert Sedgwick captured the forts of Saint John, Port Royal, and the settlement of Penobscot adding Acadia to the British dominions. La Tour was taken prisoner to England, and it was not until 1656 that he was granted an audience with Oliver Cromwell to request the return of his property. Recognized as a baronet of Nova Scotia, as his father's heir, Cromwell granted his request on the condition that he accept English allegiance and pay both the amount he owed Boston merchants and the cost of the English garrison maintained at Saint John. In an effort to raise funds to cover these funds, he took on William Crowne and Colonel William Temple as joint proprietors of Acadia. Soon afterwards he sold his rights to his two partners, retaining only a small percentage of the profit. La Tour then retired to Cap de Sable (present-day Port La Tour, Nova Scotia), with his wife, where he died in 1666. ==Marriage and issue== Charles de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour was married three times. { border=\\"1\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse;\\" - ccc;\\" !Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes - !colspan=4By Unnamed Mi'kmaq wife (married approximately 1625) - Jeanne de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour1626 1686 Married Martin d'Aprendestiguy de Martignon in 1655 and had issue - Antoinette de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour  Became a nun - Unnamed de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour  Became a nun - !colspan=4By Fran√ßoise-Marie Jacquelin (married June 1640 until her death in 1645) - Charles de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour1645  Sent back to France by d'Aulnay and adopted by Fran√ßoise-Marie's sister Gabrielle - !colspan=4By Jeanne Motin (married February 1653 until La Tour's death in 1666) - Marie de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour1654  28 May 1739 Married Alexandre Le Borgne in 1675 and had issue - Jacques de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour1655  1697 Married Anne Melanson in 1685 and had issue including Agathe de Saint Etienne de La TourAgathe de Saint Etienne de La Tour, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Retrieved 25 June 2016 - Marguerite de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour1658  15 July 1748 Married Abraham Mius d'Entremont in 1685 and had issue - Anne de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour1661  15 September 1738 Married Jacques Mius d'Entremont, 2nd Baron of Pobomcoup in 1678 and had issue - Charles de Saint-√âtienne de La Tour1663  11 August 1731 Married Jeanne Ang√©lique Loreau in 1699 and had issue - } ==Ancestry Legacy == * The communities of Port La Tour, Nova Scotia and Upper Port La Tour, Nova Scotia are named after Charles La Tour. ==External links== * * Fort Lomeron ==Notes and references== Category:Governors of Acadia Category:People of New France Category:1593 births Category:1666 deaths Category:Acadian history Category:1630s in Canada Category:1640s in Canada Category:1650s in Canada ","title":"Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour"},{"id":"5565514","text":"Chalco de D√≠az Covarrubias () is a city that is municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of Chalco. It lies in the eastern part of the State of Mexico just east of the Federal District of Mexico and is considered part of the Mexico City metropolitan area. Chalco name is Nahuatl, and comes from Challi: \\"lake edge\\", and Co: \\"place\\" therefore both words together mean \\"on the edge of the lake\\". The municipal head, bears the surname of Diaz Covarrubias, in honor of Juan D√≠az Covarrubias, one of the practitioners of medicine who was heroically shot in Tacubaya in 1859. ==History== The first group of Native Americans to reach the region of Chalco was \\"the acxotecas\\" coming from Tula, the famous and ancient homeland of the Toltecs, and the first town they settled was called Chalco. Later, a second group of people arrived, this were the Mihuaques. By 1160 A.D arrived teotenancas and chichimecas from the valley of Toluca, through Tl√°huac. Around the lake there were other groups, including cuixocas, temimilolcas and ihuipanecas, which formed a congregation of tribes with Chalcas. By 1354 the entire region was known by the name of Tzacualtitl√°n-Tenanco Amaquemeca-Chalco\\". For 1410 the territory of the Chalca almost a Confederate state, consisted in four domains: Acxotlan-Chalco, Tlalmanalco-Amaquemecan, Tenanco-Tepopollan and Xochimilco- Chimalhuacan, being Acxotlan-Chalco Header\\". War as a means of expansion and conquest becomes common, just we mention one of many: in 1376 the \\"flower war\\" that lasts eight years and is among Mexicans and Chalco, in this war only Chalca people died in battle and is because of this long struggle for survival and defense of the territory that the Chalco region didn't achieve the splendor of Texcoco or Tenochtitlan. There are two versions of the arrival of Hern√°n Cort√©s in the region of Chalco. The first one is about a Chalca who says to be aware of the presence of Cortes in Tlaxcala and Cholula, await the passage of volcanoes and bring gifts of gold, the other says Chalco were to receive Cortes Texmelucan and bought her jewelry, valuable stones, bracelets, blankets, feather-rich foods among other things. Cortes in his 2nd letter tells relationship that started from an Amecameca town that is the province of Chalco and along the way receives ambassadors of Moctezuma asking you to return or wait Moctezuma order to receive it. Cort√©s remains two days in Amecameca where you given away good food, gold and slaves. Meanwhile, Clavijero in his book Ancient History of Mexico says that \\"Cortes Amecameca Ayotzingo became, instead serving as places of hot earth. Cacamac receive the Spaniards in Ayotzingo, gives them supplies and offers city Texcoco to go away. Ixtlix√≥chitl with Spanish helped Chalca to defend the people of Xochimilco and Tlahuac, once stayed as allies of the Spaniards, Cortes Chalca seeking protection against the constant threat of the Mexica formed so a coalition of different tribes against the Aztecs, with the defeat of the Aztecs, the Chalca again dominate their territory being committed and available to Spanish and forcing inhabitants to participate in expeditions Chalca. The colony starts from the moment the distribution of land among the conquerors go. \\"Chalco, in 1533, becomes real Province for hearing decision\\" was of great importance as a production area of corn, wheat, barley, straw, wood, charcoal, fruits, vegetables, construction materials such as wood, volcanic rock and stone for his Piers Aytozingo and Chalco that were favored by the heavy traffic and near the city of Mexico. Besides the Commendation arises, Cortes himself assigned the Province of Chalco in 1520 Nu√±o de Guzm√°n takes over the province and its taxes. Tributes were also assigned to the Dominican order to build a monastery and corn taxes were appointed to the Marquis.The red circle shows where Chalco was located, when the Lake of Texcoco still existed With the decline of the Knights comes in 1530 the village and in 1563 the village arises in Chalco whose boundaries are constantly moving between Tlayacapan and Tlalmanalco. The judges continued in Chalco and elsewhere throughout the colonial period, large property of Chalco had its origins in the royal grants awarded between 1560 and 1642, the first land grant was awarded in 1565 to Juan Bautista Avendano, Anton Mendez in 1614 and 1641 Hernando de Aguilar, Alfonso N√∫√±ez Casillas and Diego Ruiz Lozano, asked permission to bring and pursue breeding cows to produce milk, cheese, butter, and so on. Simultaneously primogeniture and chiefdoms emerge; in terms of primogeniture in the province of Chalco, the most important was that of Don Miguel Saenz de Sicilia and Soria, by widespread ballot in Madrid on May 4, 1774. Lake Chalco was a major influence as Chalco in the sixteenth century was a lake port in four docks where docked trajineras carrying vegetables and seeds to Mexico City. During the nineteenth century, the most salient facts are: the consummation of Independence, the Constitution of 1824 was promulgated forming the Free and Sovereign State of Mexico with the districts of Acapulco, Cuernavaca, Huejutla, Mexico, Apaxco, Toluca, Tula and Tulancingo; both parties Chalco, Coyoacan, Cuautitlan, Ecatepec, Mexicaltzingo, Mexico, Tacuba, Teotihuacan Texcoco, Xochimilco and Zumpango. In 1861, the municipal head is appointed villa and imposed the names of \\"Diaz Covarrubias\\" in honor of Juan Diaz Covarrubias. medical student killed by Leonardo Mark on April 11, 1859. Chalco also hosted the meeting of Maximilian and Empress Carlota Amalia, who comes to receive when returning from Yucat√°n. \\"It stands out in the State of Mexico's indigenous peasant rebellion made by Julio Lopez Chavez that although it was very short (December 1867-1868), had a great importance to regional and national level, is why some authors such as Gaston Garcia Cantu, Manuel Diaz Ramirez, John Hart and others have argued that this movement was precursor of the Zapatista movement (almost 40 years earlier). Julio Lopez Chavez began his agrarian movement in favor of the division of estates among indigenous exploited, because for him the Indians were the landowners, this movement started in San Francisco Acuautla, Coatepec and San Vicente Chicoloapan, it is also executed on July 9, 1868 within the school of Lightning and Socialism \\". During the Porfiriato a major economic activity takes place, as the meeting point for traders from different places, the water communication continues with its canoes and steamboats, industry reaches further development and goods reach their peak and its beginnings were in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. Among the farms that stand out are those of Xico, the Company, the Moral, among others; also in 1895 the Regional School of Agriculture which was not successful installed and in the same year is desiccated Lake Chalco, disappearing the few fishermen who had later these lands were used as farmland. In 1890 the president of Mexico, General Porfirio D√≠az laid the foundation stone for the first City Hall and in 1893 was opened by the same agent. As the revolutionary movement of 1910, the municipality of Chalco had some clashes between Zapata and Carranza, which take Ayotzingo church, set on fire twice, they shoot several men, women outraged; Chalco destroy the Zapatistas in the parish archives, part of the church and some houses. 1979 on the grounds of Lake Chalco dried starts the largest slums in Latin America known as Valle de Chalco with more than 500,000 inhabitants in the first stage. That's why the municipal head is elevated to city status in March 1989, after November 30, 1994 the inhabitants of the region of Valle de Chalco fighting for their separation in search of an identity and better living conditions, for which the municipality 122 called Valle de Chalco Solidaridad was created. A major employer is the San Rafael paper factory. Government sources mention that the helicopter where Francisco Blake Mora traveled collided in this municipality, leaving 8 top government officials dead. ==The municipality of Chalco== View from inside of the main church in Chalco.Santiago Apostol Statue, patron saint of the town, it is displayed inside the main church. The municipality, which has an area of 234.72 km¬≤ (90.626 sq mi), had a population of 310,130 inhabitants at the 2010 census. Chalco is often confused with the Valle de Chalco Solidaridad municipality as the name Chalco is a part of both. The major difference is that Valle de Chalco Solidaridad is located near the ancient Lake Chalco. In fact, Chalco is interconnected to Valle de Chalco through Avenida Solidaridad. Towns and villages Chalco is one of only three municipalities in Mexico that have at least nine localities of over 10,000 inhabitants. (It and Tijuana Municipality, Baja California both have nine, while Tlajomulco de Z√∫√±iga Municipality, Jalisco has eleven.)

According to Chimalpahin, they came from Tula and named themselves \\"chalcas\\" The second group arriving were the Mihuaques, who hadn't leaders and adopted those ones of the Acxotecas. Circa 1160, the Chichimecas Teotenancas arrived from the Toluca valley and came across Tlahuac. They all together formed the Chalca civilization. They lived there until 1510, when the Spanish conquistadors arrived. The place remained without inhabitants until the early 20th century. The municipality has expanded to the limits of Mexico City. Now many capitalinos (residents of the capital) are moving to Chalco looking for more peace and tranquility also because housing prices are so high in Mexico City. Transportation Chalco is served by the State of Mexico collective transports divided in geographical areas (AG-##) locating Chalco within the AG-10. Volkswagen vans (\\"combis\\" or \\"colectivos\\") transport people from the municipality to the boundaries of the Federal District in order to let people take the subway from that point into the inner Mexico City. Several colectivos also run from Chalco to Mexico City's Benito Ju√°rez International Airport. ==See also== *Universidad Azteca == Notable people == * Antonio Pujol (1913‚Äì1995), painter ==References== *2010 census tables: INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica, Geograf√≠a e Inform√°tica *M√©xico Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M√©xico Category:Populated places in the State of Mexico ","title":"Chalco de D√≠az Covarrubias"},{"id":"5565527","text":"Freiheit (German for \\"freedom\\") is a 1966 short film by George Lucas, made while he was a student at the University of Southern California's film school.Fensch, Thomas, Films on the Campus, A.S.

She performed the Melodifestivalen 1998 contest winning song \\"K√§rleken √§r\\" (\\"Eternal Love\\"), and represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 with that song, which finished 10th with 53 points. In 2003 she again entered Melodifestivalen with \\"Crazy in Love\\", which finished fourth in the final. She also hosted the final of Melodifestivalen 2005. Johnson is today one of the most successful artists in Sweden, with several Gold and Platinum records and since 2014 even hosts her own Swedish TV-show from Nashville, Jills veranda. ==Biography== Johnson in 2003 Johnson is from the small town of √Ñngelholm in the south western part of Sweden, but the surroundings and the media compare her with the biggest stars in the music business. By the age of four, she had decided that she wanted to become an artist, an aspiration towards which she was highly encouraged by her local choir leader. As a 12-year-old, she started off as vocalist in a Country & Western band, Tomboola Band, touring in Norway and Denmark. She signed eventually with EMI-Medley in Denmark and recorded an album, produced by top producer Paul Bruun. The title-track, \\"Sugar Tree\\", became a hit in Denmark. In 1996, she had her first Swedish hit with \\"Kommer tid, kommer v√•r\\", a duet with Jan Johansen. In 1998, she performed \\"K√§rleken √§r\\" (\\"Eternal Love\\") at national contest Melodifestivalen, winning the Swedish finals and going on to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest. This established Johnson as one of the prime Swedish artists. The success was followed by the hit album N√§r hela v√§rlden ser p√• and a successful tour. In mid-1999, Johnson went to Los Angeles to look for material for her second album. At home, she worked with Andreas Carlsson (ASCAP Writer of the Year 2000), who is known for several massive hits, the biggest, so far, being Celine Dion's \\"That's the Way It Is\\". She also tried out a few local newcomers and the album Daughter of Eve was released in early 2000. It was very well received and Johnson was compared with some of the world's best artists. In 2000, she received a Platinum-record in Denmark for the sound-track \\"Promise To Love\\" from the Danish block-buster, Eneste Ene. Later that year, Johnson started to collaborate with other songwriters such as Jenny Orenstein, Charlie Stefl, Mary Green [Biem Writer of the Year 2001]. This resulted in her receiving a publishing contract in Nashville, Tennessee. Consequently, in 2002 Johnson's album entitled Good Girl came to be with the help of producer Scott Baggett and some of Nashville's top musicians. This album secured Johnson's artistic sound and style and once again she was extremely well received by the press in their reviews where she was described as an artist of international calibre. In the Swedish finals of the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 she qualified at fourth place (out of 32 entries) but and her song \\"Crazy in Love\\" became a hit and received a great deal of radio play and was followed by a successful tour. Johnson's collective Discography CD was released in late March 2003. It contains the 20 most popular songs since her debut in 1995. The CD went straight into the sales charts for best selling CDs in Sweden. The single \\"Crazy in Love\\" stayed at No 1 in the Swedish Top Charts (Svensktoppen) 12 weeks consecutively and No 2 for 15 weeks. Discography sold Gold in Sweden and Johnson also got a Grammis for this album. The album Roots and Wings was released in November 2003, recorded and produced by Amir Aly in Sweden and by Scott Baggett in Nashville, Tennessee. Roots and Wings sold Gold in less than two weeks and Platinum a few months later. The album Being who you are was released in Sweden in late March 2005 and sold Gold in only a few weeks. Johnson was the host of the 2005 Swedish finals of the Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm. Since 2014 she's the hostess of her own Swedish musical TV-series, Jills veranda, where she brings together and performs with different Swedish and American music personalities in Nashville, the city where she also spends much time working with her own music. In 2016 she participated in the popular musical TV-series S√• mycket b√§ttre, which was broadcast on TV4. ==Discography== Albums Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title !

It describes itself as \\"America's Largest Independent Jewish Weekly\\". The Jewish Press has an online version which is updated daily and reportedly has a readership of 2 million views each month. ==History== Jewish newspapers had been in decline in the late 1950s. Sensing the need for Jewish content created by this void, two leading rabbis, Moshe Feinstein and Simcha Elberg, delegated the task of filling it to Sholom Klass. Klass, together with his father-in-law Raphael Schreiber (1885-1980), founded The Jewish Press in January 1960, resolving to publish a national weekly newspaper in English that \\"everyone in America will be able to read\\". The first issue was published on January 29th of that year. Elliot Resnick serves as the paper's chief editor. Former editors have included Jason Maoz, Meir Kahane, Arnold Fine, Julius Liebb and Steve Walz. The online edition is run by Stephen Leavitt. ==Editorial policy== The Jewish Press is oriented toward the Modern Orthodox Jewish community, covering Jewish news from New York City, the United States, and Israel. The newspaper describes itself as having a politically conservative viewpoint and editorial policy, and \\"politically incorrect long before the phrase was coined.\\" In 1990, ultraconservative Catholic weekly The Wanderer reported about a notice posted in The Jewish Press excommunicating U.S. Representative Barney Frank, seeking to affirm similar practice in the Catholic Church. It was later pointed out to them that the notice was posted by an outlier, and that Judaism lacked a centralized excommunication process. Abraham Hecht, president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, said \\"If we were going to start excommunicating, we'd have a list as long as the New York telephone directory\\". In March 2014, The newspaper fired its Israel-based online edition editor Yori Yanover after he wrote an op-ed titled \\"50 Thousand Haredim March So Only Other Jews Die in War.\\"Staff. The piece was in reference to a Haredi Jewish prayer rally in Manhattan protesting the draft of Yeshiva students to the Israel Defence Forces. The editorial board issued an apology saying \\"The article in question was posted without authorization and approval of The Jewish Press newspaper..\\" and \\"the sentiments expressed in the article and headline do not represent these of the Jewish Press, its officers, editors and staff.\\"Greenwald, Jerry and Mauer, Naomi (March 11, 2014) \\"Apology for Monday‚Äôs Op-Ed\\", The Jewish Press Yanover wrote a response in which he replied, \\"I wrote the article after discussion with my supervisor and then submitted the article for review, as per the protocol you established.\\" ==Sections== * News: includes news focusing on the Middle East, recent news items with anti-Israel bias, and kosher food news. * Opinion: includes editorials, Israeli political analysis, and Op-Eds. * Features: includes religious columns, Jewish law, a weekly kosher dining guide, the Jewish Press Magazine, and youth sections. Monthly specials are printed in addition to features and supplements before each of the major Jewish holidays. ==Contributors== Some of The Jewish Presss contributors include Jerold Auerbach, Hollywood screenwriter Robert J. Avrech, Dr. Louis Rene Beres, Dr. Phyllis Chesler, Prof. Paul Eidelberg, photographer Jacob Elbaz, historian and mathematician Dr. L. (Yitzchok) Levine, Dr. Morris Mandel, Dr. Steven Plaut, Dr. Marvin Schick, and legal ethicist and Judaica collector Saul Jay Singer, who writes a weekly column on Collecting Jewish History. Religious contributors The Jewish Press features numerous weekly Torah columns regarding the weekly Torah portion, upcoming Jewish holidays, contemporary applications of Jewish law, philosophy, and Talmud. Current and previous authors include Rabbi Meir Kahane, Rebbitzen Esther Jungreis, Rabbi Dovid Goldwasser, Rabbi David Hollander, Rabbi Rafael Grossman, Rabbi Hanoch Teller, Rabbi Berel Wein, Rabbi Isaac C. Avigdor, Rabbi Steven Pruzansky, Rabbi Gershon Tannenbaum, Rabbi Emanuel Quint, Rabbi J. Simcha Cohen, Rabbi Francis Nataf, and Rabbi Nathan Lopes Cardozo. Political contributors During the mid-1970s, Ronald Reagan wrote a weekly column for the paper.Profile of Ronald Wilson Reagan in the Jewish Virtual Library Other contributing elected officials include Dov Hikind, Simcha Felder, former Knesset Member Menachem Porush, former Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, Knesset Member Yisrael Eichler, and Moshe Feiglin.

(Santa Maria delle Vigne (Genoa, Italy) Filippo Parodi (bottega), madonna con angeli, 1690 ca ==Biography== Born in Genoa into a family of sculptors, Parodi developed his facility with wood, then transferred his mastery to marble in the 1670s. His two extended sojourns in Rome refined his style; he joined the studio of Bernini as an assistant (1655‚Äì1661), although he appears to have been influenced by Algardi and his pupil Ercole Ferrata. Later on returning to Genoa, he met the French Baroque sculptor Pierre Puget, who stayed in Genoa from 1661‚Äì1666. Parodi developed a large studio to handle a large number of commissions. In Genoa during the 1661-1670s, he completed an Ecstasy of Saint Martha for Santa Marta, a Saint John for Santa Maria di Carignano, and a Virgin and Child for Santi Vittore e Carlo. In 1691 he was called to Padua, where he and his studio were responsible for the six white marble sculptures of saints and the Glory of Saint Anthony (1689‚Äì97) in the polychrome marble setting of the Cappella del Tesoro (\\"Chapel of the Treasure\\") at the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua. The cornice is crowded with celebrative angels by a stuccador from Lugano, Pietro Roncaioli. In Venice, he completed the elaborate funeral Monument of Bishop Francesco Morosini (1678), in San Nicol√≤ da Tolentino. For Johann Adam Andreas I von Liechtenstein of Vienna, he produced two allegorical busts: Vice and Virtue, which remain in the Liechtenstein collection, Vienna. The expressive bust of Vice has a specific Bernini source in Bernini's Anima dannata. His sculptures commissioned by Eugenio Durazzo in 1679 during the renovation of the Palazzo Balbi Durazzo, Genoa, remain in situ (the present Palazzo Reale); they are a sentimental Christ at the Column for the chapel and a set of four mythological figures from Ovid's Metamorphoses (Venus, Clytie, Adonis, and Hyacinth) for the garden. The statues are emotive and often witty reworkings of sculptures by Bernini.Christ at the Column Parodi also worked with Giacomo Antonio Ponsonelli (1654‚Äì1735) an Italian late-Baroque sculptor who was also his son-in-law. Parodi's son, Domenico Parodi (1672‚Äì1742), was a painter of some merit, initially apprenticed with Sebastiano Bombelli, then, in the early 1690s, working in the studios of Carlo Maratta and then his pupil Paolo Girolamo Piola. Other pupils of Parodi were Angelo de' Rossi, Andrea Brustolon, the brothers Francesco, Francesco Bonanni, and Bernardo Schiaffino.

This began a long career in show business for Hodges in films, on stage and popular recordings. ==Career== Stage Hodges made his professional acting debut on stage in Meredith Willson's 1957 Broadway musical The Music Man, in which he originated the character of Winthrop Paroo, and introduced the song \\"Gary, Indiana\\", with Robert Preston and Pert Kelton. Film He made his film debut in the 1959 film A Hole in the Head with Frank Sinatra and Edward G. Robinson, in which Hodges and Sinatra performed a song called \\"High Hopes\\". When Sinatra recorded the song for Capitol Records, Hodges was not included as Decca Records would not grant him permission to record the duet with Sinatra. Hodges made eight feature films and numerous TV guest appearances. He is probably best remembered for playing the title role in Michael Curtiz's 1960 film The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He also appeared in the 1962 film Advise and Consent in a minor role as well as the Disney films Summer Magic (1963) and The Happiest Millionaire (1967). TV Guest appearances on network TV productions included Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Cimarron Strip and The Dick Van Dyke Show. He was also a \\"mystery guest\\" on What's My Line?. On October 4, 1957, the day the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik 1 satellite, Hodges made a memorable appearance on the game show Name That Tune in which he partnered with then Major John Glenn (future astronaut and United States senator). In the early 1990s, the adult Hodges appeared live on a talk show on Swedish TV, where he played guitar and sang \\"I'm Gonna Knock on Your Door\\". Recording In 1959 at age 12, Hodges became Mississippi's first Grammy Award winner for his contribution to the original Broadway cast album of The Music Man for which he sang a solo and was credited as the lead singer on another song. It was the first year that the Grammys were awarded. At the age of 14, Hodges recorded for Cadence Records and his biggest hit was \\"I'm Gonna Knock on Your Door\\" in 1961. He also scored a minor hit with \\"(Girls, Girls, Girls) Made to Love,\\" a song written by Phil Everly and originally recorded by the Everly Brothers. He recorded for several other record labels. Before he left Hollywood, he was a union musician, record producer, songwriter and music publisher. He collaborated with Tandyn Almer (\\"Along Comes Mary\\") with whom he wrote and published several songs and owned his own music publishing business. Hodges continues to write songs today, but is no longer involved professionally in the music industry. ==Personal life== Hodges was drafted into the Army during the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, but remained in the U.S. in a non-combat assignment. After he was discharged, he returned to Hollywood and became disillusioned with show business. He decided to return to his native Mississippi and entered the University of Southern Mississippi where he received his B.S. in Psychology and an M.S. in Counseling. He became a mental health counselor and retired from practice after a long career in the field. He converted to Catholicism in 1998. He is divorced and has two grown children and six grandchildren. He occasionally gets in touch with his old show business friends and still writes songs, though he is unable to play guitar due to spinal nerve injuries. Hodges rode out Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and informed his fans that he was fine after being without water, electricity and telephone/internet contact for 19 days when the utilities were restored. ==Filmography== {  - !

His father was of German Jewish descent, and his mother ( Finlay) was from Scotland. His younger brother was Erwin Finlay Freundlich (1885‚Äì1964). He was a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry (now the Fritz Haber Institute) from 1919 until 1933, when the racial policies of the Nazi party demanded the dismissal of non-Aryans from senior posts. In 1934 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Emigrating to England, Freundlich accepted a guest professorship at University College London. Five years later, he accepted a professorship at the University of Minnesota. He died in Minneapolis two years later. Freundlich's main works dealt with the coagulation and stability of colloidal solutions. His most prominent student was Robert Havemann who became a well known colloid chemist of the German Democratic Republic. His work is of continuing importance, with his 1907 paper \\"√úber die Adsorption in L√∂sungen\\" (On adsorption in solutions) becoming highly cited at the beginning of the 21st century. This early paper was based on his habilitation thesis written in Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald, and was heavily based on the work of Sten Lagergren. == See also == * Freundlich equation ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Herbert Freundlich - Did you know that the man of science Herbert Freudlich was also a composer? * Ausstellungstafel der TU Berlin zu Prof. Freundlich * Otto Hahns Rolle als Interimsdirektor des KWI f√ºr Physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie 1933.

E. Cummings. First published in 1940, the poem details the lives of residents in a nameless town. Like much of Cummings's work, the poem is actually untitled, so critics use the first line to refer to the poem. Cummings often wrote in a manner that did not follow standard English syntax and punctuation. This style is evident in the poem's first line, which is written in all lowercase letters and contains the unlikely phrase \\"pretty how town\\". The poem inspired a short film of the same name by George Lucas. ==Style== In the poem, Cummings states the lines, \\"spring summer autumn winter\\", (3) and \\"sun moon stars rain\\", (8) multiple times. In reiterating these lines he changes the order of the seasons, \\"autumn winter spring summer\\", (11) and \\"stars rain sun moon\\", (21). == References  External links == *Full text of the poem at Poets.org Category:1940 poems Category:Poetry by E.

Its taxonomic affiliation is uncertain but at its first scientific discussion by Johann Georg Wagler in 1829 it was classified into the genus Gallicolumba (which includes ground doves and bleeding-hearts); its closest relative is possibly the Santa Cruz ground dove. It was endemic to the Pacific island of Tanna, Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides). Forster records a native name mahk, almost certainly from the Kwamera language. ==Taxonomy== The taxonomic authority is often given as Wagler (1829). However, although Forster's Descriptiones‚Ä¶ was finally printed in 1844, some time after Wagler's treatise, the original description was written in 1775 and thus predates Wagler. This species was formerly in the genus Alopecoenas Sharpe, 1899, but the name of the genus was changed in 2019 to Pampusana Bonaparte, 1855 as this name has priority. ==Description== The Tanna ground dove was only known from two specimens, which are both now lost. The better-known was a female which was sketched by Georg Forster at Tanna during the second circumnavigation by James Cook to the South Sea in August 1774. This painting can be seen in the Natural History Museum in London. The specimen's fate is unknown. Another specimen, a male, was recently determined to have been part of the Banksian Collection at the Natural History Museum in London. As with the female, only a picture now survives. The circumstances of the bird's acquisition and loss are unknown. According to Forster's description the female specimen had a length of 27 cm. The head and the breast of the female were rusty brown. The back was coloured dark red to purple. The wings had a dark green hue, with the primaries brown-grey with narrow pale edges. The abdomen was grey. In the male, the forehead, supercilium and lower part of the head, as well as the throat and the breast were white as in the nominate race of the Polynesian ground dove, and its belly was reddish-black. The bill was blackish with a slightly swollen cere. The iris was yellowish and the feet were coloured red. When the Forsters analyzed the crop or gizzard of the dead dove they noticed that it contained a wild nutmeg (Myristica inutilis). They searched for this tree on Tanna but their endeavor was not successful. The tree was later determined to be not uncommon in the island's forests but rather small and thus easily overlooked; it is known to the local population as netan. ==Extinction== The year of its extinction is unknown, but it can be assumed that the bird disappeared not later than the early 19th century. When Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg saw the female specimen on August 17, 1774 they shot it. The only remaining evidence of its existence, apart from the paintings, is an entry in Forster's notes: \\"...behind these fields we came into a forest [where] a dove of a new [kind] was shot.\\" Likewise, it is not known why this species became extinct, but introduced rats are a prime suspect. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Day, David (1981): The Doomsday Book of Animals.

The visit proved influential, resulting in a stunning series of impressionistic views of picturesque cityscapes and landscapes, Paris streets and gardens, and the French countryside. Architecture and landscape fascinated Cone for the rest of his life. He returned to Paris with his wife Winnifred in 1929 and traveled to Mexico in 1939. Cone lived all his 74 years in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he married, raised a family, and for more than four decades taught art at Coe College. Although he never achieved great fame, he was highly respected by his contemporaries. Marvin Cone sought to evoke his inner vision of nature rather than to create a realistic depiction of the rural landscape. To Cone, nature was a vehicle for revealing certain truths. His paintings integrated his firsthand observation of nature. He once said, \\"The purpose of art is not to reproduce life, but to present an editorial, a comment on life.... The artist does not set out to imitate nature. What would be the purpose of that? Let the camera with its clever mechanism imitate. Art, such as poetry, music, and painting, is simply a portion of the experience of the artist. When we actually see ideals, they become real to us. Art traces an abstraction and makes it audible or visual. It symbolizes the whole of life. We believe in something we can see.‚Äù ==References External links == * Cedar Rapids Museum of Art Category:1891 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Artists from Cedar Rapids, Iowa Category:Painters from Iowa Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:Coe College faculty Category:American alumni of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni ","title":"Marvin Cone"},{"id":"5565756","text":"Sean Murphy may refer to: ==Sports== * Se√°n √ìg Murphy (1897‚Äì1956), Irish hurler * Se√°n Murphy (hurler) (born 1947), Irish hurler * Se√°n Murphy (Gaelic footballer) (born 1932), Irish football player * Sean Murphy (boxer) (born 1964), English Commonwealth Games Gold-winning boxer * Sean Murphy (swimmer) (born 1964), Canadian * Sean Murphy (golfer) (born 1965), American * Sean Murphy (racing driver) (born 1984), in Auckland, New Zealand * Sean Murphy (baseball) * Sean Murphy (rower) (born 1996), Australian rower ==Other== * Sean Murphy (artist), American comic book creator * Sean Murphy (cryptographer), professor at Royal Holloway, University of London * Sean Murphy (journalist) (born 1958), Australian journalist * Sean Murphy (photographer), American photographer * Sean D.

A native of Germany, he was an Ashkenazic Jew. == Life == Zuckermann was born in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw), in the Kingdom of Prussia's Province of Silesia. He received a thorough Hebrew and secular education at the institutions of his native city, and devoted himself at the university to the study of mathematics and astronomy. In 1845 he joined Heinrich Graetz in agitating for an address to Zecharias Frankel to congratulate him on the conservative stand which he had taken against the Frankfurt Conference; and when Frankel assumed the management of the Breslau seminary he appointed Zuckermann on the teaching staff. He gave instruction in mathematics to those of the students who had not had a regular school training, and taught calendric science in the academic department, at the same time acting as librarian and administrator of the stipendiary fund. Zuckermann's religious attitude was strictly Orthodox. Twice a day he attended the synagogue maintained by him in the house which he had inherited from his father, although he lived in the seminary building, where daily services were held in the chapel. He never married; and while genial and kindly in nature, he was strongly opposed to anything savoring of ostentation. On his 70th birthday he fled from Breslau to escape all ovations, and in his will he forbade the delivering of a funeral address. He died in Breslau. == Writings == * \\"√úber Sabbathjahrcyclus und Jubelperiode,\\" Breslau, 1859 (translated into English by A.

Designed by Intamin, it is a Freefall model that was originally located at Cedar Point when it first opened to the public in 1983. It was relocated to Dorney Park following the 2009 season and reopened in 2010. It is one of the oldest of its kind still in operation. ==History== Demon Drop while at Cedar Point Demon Drop debuted at Cedar Point in 1983. It was very popular as it was located at the very front of the park. In 2005, rumors started of the ride being relocated or dismantled when the ride was put up for sale. On October 21, 2009, Cedar Point officials announced that Demon Drop would be moved to its sister park, Knott's Berry Farm, for the 2010 season. In November, fans of Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom spotted pieces similar to Demon Drop at its park in Pennsylvania. On December 2, 2009, it was announced that Demon Drop would not be relocated to Knott's Berry Farm. Instead, it would be relocated to Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom. It officially opened at Dorney Park on July 8, 2010. ==Ride Description== The ride can accommodate up to four riders, and consists of three main sections; the loading and unloading station, the lift tower, and the drop and run-out track. Riders are loaded into a gondola type car near ground level at the station and secured with an over the shoulder harnesses. The gondola is then moved backwards horizontally to the rear base of the lift tower and then climbs vertically to the top of the tower in 7.2 seconds. Once there, it slides forward and hangs over the drop track for a few seconds. Without warning, the car is released and riders drop 60 feet in less than two seconds before experiencing the deceleration g-forces as the car enters a pull-out curve which transitions the vertical fall into a horizontal brake run. As the gondola rolls through the brake run to slow down, the riders are facing the sky. Once it stops at the end of the run, a mechanism swings the top of the car down, and the gondola moves in reverse at a downward 45 degree angle to another track where it returns to an upright position. It then returns to the station in reverse traveling below the brake run track. ==See also== * Power Tower, a S&S; Worldwide drop tower ride at Cedar Point * Dominator, a S&S; Worldwide drop ride at Dorney Park ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official page * Demon Drop Photo Gallery Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1983 Category:Towers completed in 1983 Category:Amusement rides that closed in 2009 Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2010 Category:Amusement rides manufactured by Intamin Category:Cedar Point Category:Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom Category:Cedar Fair attractions Category:Drop tower rides Category:1983 establishments in Ohio Category:2009 disestablishments in Ohio Category:2010 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Demon Drop"},{"id":"5565772","text":"The Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, also known as URLTA, is a sample law governing residential landlord and tenant interactions, created in 1972 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in the United States.

The Maya Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 21,602 km, one-fifth of the country's total land area. The park is home to a large number of species of fauna including Morelet's crocodile and the ocellated turkey. It is also rich in flora including breadnut, mahogany, Swietenia humilis, Bloma prisca, Vitex gaumeri, cedar, Bucida buceras, Haematoxylum campechianum, Rhizophora mangle, and Pimenta dioica. The area ranges from wetlands, to low mountain ranges, and has several bodies of water, including lakes, rivers, streams and cenotes. The Reserve was created in 1990 to protect the largest area of American tropical forest remaining north of the Amazon. The biosphere reserve model, implemented by UNESCO, seeks to promote a balance between human activities and the biosphere by including sustainable economic development in conservation planning. ==Human activity== The Maya Biosphere Reserve is divided into several zones, each with a different protected status. The core zones are formed by several national parks and biotopes (wildlife preserves), in which no human settlement, logging, or extraction of resources are allowed. These include Laguna del Tigre National Park, Sierra del Lacand√≥n National Park, Mirador-R√≠o Azul National Park, Tikal National Park, El Zotz Biotope, Naacht√∫n-Dos Lagunas Biotope, Cerro Cahu√≠ Biotope, Laguna del Tigre Biotope, and El Pilar Natural Monument. The core zones cover an area of 7670 km2, which is 36% of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. In multiple-use zones (8484.40 km2; 40%) and the buffer zone (4975 km2; 24%), which comprises the southern portion of the Reserve, certain regulated economic activities are allowed. These include the sustainable harvesting of wood and traditional forest products which include chicle, a sap used in the manufacture of chewing gum, xate, an ornamental palm plant used in floral arrangements, and pimenta or allspice. The Guatemalan government has granted forest concessions to local communities, giving them the right to practice sustainable forestry in delineated areas for 25 years. International monitoring groups such as the Forest Stewardship Council certify logging activities as sustainable. In 2005, were certified. In other parts of the multiple-use zone, farming communities have been granted the right to continue farming in so-called agricultural polygons. ==Archaeology== The Tikal plaza in December 2010 The Maya Biosphere Reserve is home to a large concentration of ancient Maya cities, many of which are under excavation. Tikal is the most famous of these, attracting about 120,000 to 180,000 visitors per year. The Mirador Basin, in the northern part of the Reserve, contains numerous interconnected Maya cities. The project is directed by Richard Hansen, an archaeologist at El Mirador, the largest of the sites, dating from the preclassic Maya period. Other cities in the region include El Tintal, Nakbe, and Wakna. In 2018, 60.000 uncharted structures were revealed by archaeologists with help of the revolutionary technology lasers called 'lidar' in the northern Guatemala. The project was mapped near the Maya Biosphere Reserve. Unlike previous assumptions, thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million Maya people inhabited in the northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like Tikal were bigger than previously thought. Houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications were unearthed because of the Lidar. According to the archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is overwhelming finding in over 150 years of Maya archaeology. ==Environmental threats== Ecosystems in Maya Biosphere Reserve face numerous threats from human activities, including illegal logging, farming, and ranching in protected areas, as well as drug trafficking, poaching, and looting of Maya artifacts. The forest area of the Reserve has shrunk by 13 percent over the last 21 years according to the non-profit organization Rainforest Alliance, which has several community development projects in the region. Since 2000, illegal cattle ranches have cleared about 8 percent of the reserve.Elbein, Saul From Cocaine Cowboys to Narco-Ranchers Foreign Policy. 13 July 2016 Some of the most extreme deforestation has occurred in the Laguna del Tigre and Sierra del Lancandon National Parks. In Laguna del Tigre National Park analysis of aerial images in 2020, found evidence of large-scale cattle ranching in 87% of the images. Large ranches were encouraged by the government in the 1960s and from circa 2002 narcos, laundered cash by buying land and cattle and selling the meat for money that cannot be traced to drug activity. Campesinos (small-scale farmers) have smaller plots and tend to grow food crops as well as pasture, whereas drug traffickers clear dozens of hectares which are rectangular, have long straight lines and tractor tyre marks may be seen. ==ReferencesExternal links== * CONAP * Parks Watch Web Site * Maya Biosphere Reserve, Guatemala from The Nature Conservancy's website. * Untold Stories, Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting * ProPeten Category:Biosphere reserves of Guatemala Category:Maya sites in Pet√©n Department Category:Natural history of Guatemala ","title":"Maya Biosphere Reserve"},{"id":"5565805","text":"The Final Swing is a compilation album by English hard rock band Trapeze.

It was known as Kingswood until 1 May 1902 when the name was changed to Lapworth to avoid confusion with the station of the same name in Surrey. From 1894, Lapworth was the starting point of a short lived branch line to Henley-in-Arden. The branch was closed as an economy measure during the First World War in 1915, and never reopened. A footbridge spans the remaining two tracks, and continues to the west of the northbound platform spanning where quadruple tracks once existed. For a brief period prior to the lifting of the quadruple tracks there was a DMU service along what had been the GWR's Paddington - Birkenhead main line. It plied between Wellington (Shropshire) and Lapworth stopping at all the intermediate stations and linking them with Wolverhampton Low Level and Birmingham Snow Hill. The station is unstaffed; ticketing is restricted to a 'Permit-to-Travel' machine located at the main entrance to the station (off Station Lane) at the north end of the London-bound (southbound) platform.

His most recent spell he had as technical director and head coach of Tunisian club √âtoile Sportive du Sahel in 2012. ==Playing career== Club career Krauss started his professional career at local outfit Borussia Dortmund but limited chances there made him move to Austrian Bundesliga side Rapid Wien in 1977. The move proved to be successful, winning the league title (twice) and the domestic cup. He only returned to Germany in 1983 to join Borussia M√∂nchengladbach where he finished his playing career and took up a coaching post. International career The German-born Krauss was tempted to become an Austrian citizen when playing at Rapid Wien and joined Austria's national team set-up. He made his debut for Austria in 1981 and was a participant at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He earned 22 caps, no goals scored ‚Äì however, he did score an own goal rather tellingly against West Germany in a game on 29 April 1981 that ended 0‚Äì2.

He served as the head football coach at Washington State University (1915‚Äì1917), Purdue University (1921), Louisiana Tech University (1922‚Äì1923), University of Wyoming (1924‚Äì1926), Haskell Institute‚Äînow known as Haskell Indian Nations University (1929‚Äì1932), and Albright College (1937‚Äì1942). From 1933 to 1934, Dietz served as the head coach for the National Football League's Boston Redskins, where he tallied a mark of 11‚Äì11‚Äì2. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2012. Dietz's true identity remains controversial. Although he is recognized as an \\"Indian athlete\\" by Dan Snyder, owner of the Washington Football Team (formerly known as the Washington Redskins), Indian Country Today Media Network ran a series of articles in 2004 exposing Dietz as a white man masquerading as a Native American.Linda M. Waggoner, Reclaiming James One Star, Indian Country Today Media Network, 5 pt. series, July 2, 12, 20, 27, Aug. 8, 2004. In 1988, the National Congress of American Indians attempted to meet and discuss the issue with the team's former owner, Jack Kent Cooke, but Cooke refused a meeting. ==Early life== According to census records and to his birth certificate, he was born William Henry Dietz, or \\"Willie,\\" on August 17, 1884, in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, at 16 West Humbird Street. His father William Wallace Dietz, settled in the area in 1871 and was elected county sheriff in 1877. His father married Leanna Ginder in November 1879. \\"Willie\\" attended Oklahoma's Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, where he may have feigned some kind of Indian identity for the first time according to researcher Linda Waggoner. She wrote, \\"Naturally, visitors to the St. Louis World's Fair exhibit, including Dietz's future wife, Winnebago artist Angel De Cora (1871‚Äì1919), thought Dietz was a Chilocco student.\\" Waggoner traced Dietz' heritage in several articles in Indian Country Today Media Network and at a 2013 symposium at the National Museum of the American Indian. Contested heritage Dietz's heritage was first contested in 1916 after former neighbors who settled on the Pacific Coast heard he was posing as a Native American. In December 1918 the Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into his heritage after he registered for the draft as a \\"Non-Citizen Indian\\" with an allotment. The Bureau found he had taken on the identity of James One Star, an Oglala man of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 12 years his senior who had disappeared in Cuba in 1894. Dietz also claimed he was the head of an American film company that produced propaganda films for the war. Dietz was tried in Spokane, Washington in June 1919 for the first offense. One Star's sister, Sallie Eaglehorse, testified after seeing him for the first time at the trial that Dietz was definitely not her brother. Still, the judge instructed the jury to determine whether Dietz \\"believed\\" he was a Native American, not whether it was true. Despite that others had witnessed his birth in the summer of 1884 or had seen him the following day, Dietz's mother Leanna claimed he was the Native American son of her husband who had been switched a week or more after she had a stillbirth. Dietz's acting ability along with his mother's fallacious testimony (to protect him from prison) resulted in a hung jury, but Dietz was immediately re-indicted. The second trial resulted in a sentence of 30 days in the Spokane County Jail after he pleaded \\"no contest\\". ==Playing career== Dietz played at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, with teammate Jim Thorpe, under famed coach Pop Warner. ==Coaching career== In 1921, Dietz took a coaching position with Purdue University in Indiana. After Angel De Cora died in 1919, he married Doris O. Pottlitzer, a middle-aged local journalist, on January 29, 1922. The week previous to their marriage, Purdue officials fired him for illegal recruiting. In spring 1933, George Preston Marshall, owner of the Boston Braves, hired Dietz to replace Coach Lud Wray. In 1937, the team moved to Washington, D.C. For the rest of his life, Dietz continued to promote himself as Lone Star Dietz, the son of W. W. and Julia One Star of Pine Ridge. He took on his last coaching job in 1937 for Albright College in Pennsylvania; in 1964, still married to Doris, Dietz died in Reading, Pennsylvania. Later in life, Dietz was an active painter exhibiting his work at Lafayette College with in an exhibit curated by Francis Quirk. He and Doris were so poor that former teammates purchased his headstone. It reads: \\"William ‚ÄòLone Star‚Äô Dietz born in South Dakota.\\" George Preston Marshall, owner and founder of the Boston Braves, sought to rename the franchise in 1933 after leaving the stadium the team had shared with the baseball team of the same name. Marshall was said to have named the Redskins in honor of Dietz, who claimed to be of the Sioux Nation, by analogy with the Red Sox who shared the team's new home, Fenway Park. (a review of the book Showdown: JFK and the Integration of the Washington Redskins (2011) by Thomas G. Smith) A 1933 news article quotes Marshall as saying he named the team because of real Indians on the team. However, Marshall is only talking about why he specifically chose Redskins. Dietz was hired before the name change and is cited in many articles and by Marshall as being a reason he kept the Native American theme when changing the team name. ==Recognition== Dietz was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2012. ==Nickname== Dietz named himself \\"Lone Star\\" after James One Star, the alleged nephew of an Oglala Buffalo Bill Performer sometime after the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. \\"Lone Star\\" and \\"One Star\\" are the same name in Oglala. ==Personal life== Dietz divorced De Cora in November 1918, charging her with abandonment. It is not clear how much she knew about his identity. She died six days after his indictment. Later in life, Dietz was an active painter exhibiting his work at Lehigh University with sculptors Joseph Brown and Jose deRivera in a 1955 exhibit curated by Francis Quirk. ==Head coaching record== College football NFL College baseball ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Keep A-goin': the life of Lone Star Dietz (2006) , hardback; , softcover (2006) *Doctors, Lawyers, Indian Chiefs (2008) softcover devotes a chapter to Lone Star Dietz *At last, Lone Star in the Hall of Fame (May 22, 2012 by Cougfan.com) ==External links== * * Category:1884 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Albright Lions football coaches Category:Carlisle Indians football coaches Category:Carlisle Indians football players Category:Haskell Indian Nations Fighting Indians football coaches Category:Louisiana Tech Bulldogs baseball coaches Category:Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football coaches Category:Ole Miss Rebels football coaches Category:Purdue Boilermakers football coaches Category:Washington State Cougars football coaches Category:Wyoming Cowboys football coaches Category:Washington Redskins coaches Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Rice Lake, Wisconsin Category:Players of American football from Wisconsin Category:American football tackles ","title":"William Henry Dietz"},{"id":"5565835","text":"Hot Wire is the fourth studio album by English hard rock band Trapeze.

Early in his youth he was sent to Saint John, New Brunswick to learn business practices at the firm of Leverett DeVeber. He later worked as a merchant selling general merchandise, holding mortgages on large tracts of land, and loaning money to business ventures. In 1831, Chipman married Sophia Araminta Cogswell. He was elected to the 1st Canadian Parliament on September 20, 1867 as a member of the Anti-Confederation Party. At the anti-confederate convention of August 1868 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in opposition to Joseph Howe, he proposed that the best way of getting the Confederation repealed would be for all anti- confederate Members of Parliament to offer their resignations. The policy was not accepted, and he continued to sit in the House of Commons. From January 30, 1869 onward he was a member of the Liberal Party. He died on April 9, 1870 in Ottawa from an onset of smallpox.

Having received his early instruction from his father, who was a teacher in his native town, he attended the yeshiva of Kempen, of Myslowitz (under David Deutsch), and of Prague (under Rapoport); but, wishing to receive a regular school education, he went to Breslau, where he entered the gymnasium, and graduated in 1846. He continued his studies at the universities of Berlin and Halle (Ph.D. 1851) and passed his examination as teacher for the gymnasium. Returning to Berlin, he taught in various private schools, until Michael Sachs, with whom he was always on terms of intimate friendship, appointed him principal of the religious school which had been opened in that city in 1854. At the same time Rosin gave religious instruction to the students of the Jewish normal school. In 1866 he was appointed Manuel Jo√´l's successor as professor of homiletics, exegetical literature, and Midrash at the rabbinical seminary in Breslau, which position he held till his death. == Literary works == Rosin was the author of: * \\"Abschiedswort: Berichte √ºber die J√ºdische Religionsschule,\\" Berlin, 1866; * \\"Ein Compendium der J√ºdischen Gesetzeskunde aus dem 14. Jahrhundert,\\" Breslau, 1871 (on the \\"Sefer ha-·∏§innuk\\"); * \\"Ethik des Maimonides,\\" ib. 1876; * \\"Me√Ør ben Samuel als Schrifterkl√§rer,\\" ib. 1880; * \\"Reime und Gedichte des Abraham ibn Esra,\\" in 5 parts, ib. 1885-94 (Ibn Ezra's poems with vocalized text and German transl. in rime). Rosin is most famous for his comprehensive publication of Rashbam's (Rabbi Samuel ben Meir, the grandson of Rashi) commentary on the Pentateuch. He was responsible for making this unique commentary available to the public. He thoroughly analyzed this commentary, citing available manuscripts. Rashbam's commentary is famous for its plain meaning explanations of the Chumash (Pentateuch). This plain meaning explanation of the Chumash is termed peshat in Hebrew. Without Rosin's work, Rashbam's commentary may likely never have been known or published, as all manuscripts of his work were later destroyed during wartime. He edited Michael Sachs' sermons (2 vols., Berlin, 1867), and he published Rabbi Samuel ben Me√Ør's commentary on the Pentateuch, with a Hebrew introduction and Hebrew language analysis, Breslau, 1881. He also published his Rashbam analysis in the German language. An essay of Rosin's on the philosophy of Abraham ibn Ezra was edited after his death by his devoted pupil David Kaufmann and published in the \\"Monatsschrift\\" (vols. xlii.-xliii.), to which magazine Rosin occasionally contributed. Rosin did his literary work with an exemplary accuracy of detail and in perfect sympathy with his subject. To his numerous disciples he was a kind friend and adviser. In his religious attitude he was strictly conservative, a true disciple of Michael Sachs (whose admirer he was); and he was at the same time broad-minded and tolerant of the opinions of others. His only son, Heinrich Rosin, is professor of medicine at the University of Berlin. Another Heinrich Rosin, professor in the law department of the University of Freiburg, is his nephew. == References == * Category:1823 births Category:1894 deaths Category:19th-century German people Category:Philosophers of Judaism Category:Silesian Jews Category:German Jews Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:People from the Province of Silesia Category:People from Olesno ","title":"David Rosin"},{"id":"5565862","text":"Universal Audio is the fifth and final studio album by Scottish indie rock band The Delgados, released 20 September 2004.

He entered the Hudson's Bay Company's service in 1854, and in 1862 was in charge of the post on Stuart Lake; gave his name to Moberly Lake in the Peace River country. After nearly 40 years service, retired in Saskatchewan, in 1894. Moberly was born at Penetanguishene, Ontario, on 2 August 1835. His father was Post-Captain John Moberly, R.N., and his mother Marie Foch, a Polish lady whose ancestral home was in Alsace-Lorraine. Henry John was a younger son. Several of the Moberlys have given distinguished service in the fields of engineering and exploration of Canada. Moberly was educated at the Barrie Grammar School and Upper Canada College. Study, however, to one of his restless and adventurous temperament, became irksome, and at the age of sixteen, his father having secured for him a position with the internationally known English insurance house of Lloyd's, he left school and was sent to the St. Petersburg agency of the firm. Once the novelty of a strange environment wore off, life in Russia palled on the boy and his roving nature again asserting itself, after two years he quit his employment and returned to Canada in 1853. Soon afterwards Moberly met a member of the party sent by the overland route via the Mackenzie to the Arctic in search of Sir John Franklin. His account of the Saskatchewan country, the immense herds of buffalo, the droves of deer, freedom from restrictive laws, Indians on the warpath and dearth of police, fired Moberly's youthful soul. Without hesitation Moberly wrote to Sir George Simpson then Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, requesting to be sent to the Saskatchewan, in the service of the ancient organization. Sometime in January 1854, Moberly received a reply from Sir George, with a five-year contract and instructions to meet the canoes at Sault Ste. Marie, from which point he was to travel with Sir George to his destination. Departure from his home after the opening of Navigation on Lake Huron would have allowed plenty of time to reach the Sault, however, the desire of making a start toward the promised land was too strong for his patience and he left the East during the next month. In February, 1854, Henry Moberly, a youth of eighteen, stood one day on the street of his native village, bargaining earnestly with some First Nations people. At that time, the Government employed Indians to carry the mail on sleds from Penetanguishene to the Sault. They were required to haul one hundred and eighty pounds on each sled, besides their food, cooking outfit and blankets, using no dogs but doing the work themselves. For five dollars the two carriers agreed to take Moberly and his outfit, as far as Fort la Cloche, a Hudson's Bay Company post situated on the north-shore mainland of Lake Huron, opposite Manitoulin Island. He landed at Manitou Island where he remained a few days with the Indian Agent, Captain Ironside. Moberly then crossed to the mainland at the mouth of the La Cloche River where he made his first acquaintance with a Hudson's Bay Company trading post and the first Hudson's Bay Company officer he had ever seen. Waiting a few months at Fort La Cloche for the canoes, they came as customary up the Ottawa, thence down the French River to its mouth in Lake Huron and via Manitoulin Island to Fort La Cloche. They brought a letter from Sir George, who was coming by rail through Chicago, instructing Moberly to meet him at Sault Ste. Marie. After the men had rested for a few hours they embarked. The canoes were in charge of Robert Campbell, a commissioned officer who had spent many years at the Hudson's Bay Company's posts on the Yukon, the lower Mackenzie, Dease Lake and Peel River. Moberly found him to be a most agreeable companion who gave him much information about the north. For almost 40 years following this, Henry John Moberly worked for the Hudson's Bay Company, at various locations in the Canadian North-West, retiring from active service in the spring of 1894. From Red River carts, horses, draught oxen, dog trains, York Boats, canoes and pack mules, Moberly witnessed the change to the conveniences of modern civilization, wagon roads, railroads, steamboats, telegraphs, telephones and electric lights. ==References== Category:Hudson's Bay Company people Category:Canadian explorers Category:1835 births Category:1931 deaths Category:People from Penetanguishene ","title":"Henry John Moberly"},{"id":"5565879","text":"Klaus Lindenberger (born 28 May 1957 in Linz, Austria) is a retired Austrian football goalkeeper and former manager of Austrian Bundesliga side LASK Linz. ==Club career== Lindenberger made his professional debut with LASK Linz in the 1976/1977 season and stayed with his hometown club for over ten years before moving to and winning silverware with FC Swarovski Tirol.

In the midst of a series of bewildering misfortunes apparently emanating from broken mirrors, black cats, and similar sources, Daniel meets Greenwich Village artist Lucette Bancroft (Kathleen Clifford), and mutual love results. A Westerner who owns land in partnership with Lucette's uncle comes to the city and plot's with Daniel's uncle Curtis (Ralph Lewis) to defraud his partner. Daniel, after being driven to the verge of suicide by the scientist and his aides, is saved when it is discovered that Dr. Metz is insane. Daniel then follows the Westerner, who has convinced Lucette to return to the west with him, when a flood engulfs the train they are riding on.

The series was produced by J.C.Staff and aired in Japan on Fuji TV between April 2001 and January 2002, running for thirty episodes. Episodes 29 and 30 aired together as a 1-hour special. ==Summary== The series focuses on PaRappa, a cute and happy dog who enjoys music and dancing and often spends time with his friends PJ Berri, Katy Kat, and the girl of his dreams, Sunny Funny. Along with various characters who make returning appearances from the video games, the anime introduces several new characters who are exclusive to the TV series. These include Matt Major, PJ's friend from Club Fun, Paula Fox, Sunny's friend who was rivals with Katy, Pinto, PaRappa's little sister, and Gaster and Groober, a villainous duo who cause all sorts of mischief. ==Production== During the production of PaRappa the Rapper 2, Sony wanted to develop a PaRappa anime aimed at children in order to boost merchandise sales. The series was a joint production effort between Fuji TV, SME Visual Works, and J.C.Staff. Rodney Greenblat, the art director for the PaRappa games, was asked to design new characters who would appear in the anime. He was against the idea of the show being aimed towards children and instead wanted it to be aimed towards teenagers, but this did not end up happening. He was not allowed to work on the anime at all aside from the character design, as the anime team did not want anyone pulled away from the production of the second game. In an interview with Gamasutra, Greenblat voiced his frustration about the production of the anime. ==Music== The series' soundtrack was composed by series designer Masaya Matsuura, along with Yoshihisa Suzuki and Yasushi Kurobane. The series uses four pieces of theme music; two opening themes and two ending themes. For the first fifteen episodes, the opening theme is by Nona Reeves while the ending theme is \\"School Girl\\" by Bennie K. For episodes sixteen onwards, the opening theme is \\"Attitude\\" by Crystal Kay while the ending theme is by Chara. The original soundtrack was released in two volumes by Sony Music Entertainment on August 22, 2001 and December 19, 2001, respectively.https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00005N763https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00005TOKG ==Voice cast== {  - !

The Shah Jahan period monument previously acted as a gateway to a large garden, and was built in 1646 C.E. ==Background== Chauburji is located on Lahore's Multan Road, which leads southwards to Multan, and was the gateway to an extensive garden known to have existed in Mughal times. The name \\"Chauburji,\\" which translates as \\"four towers\\" was likely given by later generations, as the site as seen as a monumental gateway to an extensive garden. ==History== Chauburji in the 1880s The establishment of this garden is often attributed to Mughal Princess Zeb-un-Nisa, who is believed to be referenced in an inscription naming her \\"Sahib-e-Zebinda Begam-e-Dauran.\\" The princess was eight years old at the time of construction, so it has been suggested that the inscription may actually be in reference to her aunt, Jahanara Begum, who was a daughter of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Lost Mughal garden The garden for which Chauburji acted as a gateway no longer exists, and the structure is now located in a grassy roundabout at the busy intersection of Lahore's Multan Road, and Bahawalpur Road. The Mughal garden is believed to have extended from Nawankot in the south, and extending towards the Lahore. Flooding from the Ravi river is believed have destroyed most of the garden during the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb. No traces of the once expansive garden survive aside from the Chauburji gate. ==Architecture== A view of Chauburjis iwans Chauburji is built in a syncretic style that blends Mughal architecture, the older Timurid- style from Central Asia, and Perso-Arabic styles from the Middle East. Its distinguishing features are the minarets which greatly widen at the top - a unique feature not present anywhere in the sub-continent. Some, however, believe that there were cupolas upon these minarets which collapsed with the passage of time. The eastern and western facades of the structure are decorated by two-storey Timurid-style iwans flanked by two levels of alcoves in a style typical of the Shah Jehan period of Mughal architecture. The building was once covered in intricate blue and green kashi kari (or Kashan- style) tile work and frescoes. The iwans are embellished with muqarnas, which were first introduced into the Mughal Empire from Persia with construction of Lahore's Wazir Khan Mosque. The building's red brickwork is typical of the Muslim buildings of the sub-continent; the doorways and windows running through the interior corridors are examples of the living style that characterised Mughal structures. Although most of the inscriptions on Chauburjia have been lost, on the upper-most part of the construction Ayat-ul- Kursi can be seen in Arabic script in blue and worked in porcelain. It has been suggested that the Charminar of Hyderabad, India influenced the architecture of Chauburji. ==Renovation== During a severe earthquake in 1843, the north-western minaret collapsed and cracks appeared in the central arch. This has however been restored as much as was reasonably possible and the gateway now looks quite as it might have been during the time of its Mughal patroness. The restoration was carried out by the Department of Archeology in the late 1960s. ==Conservation== Chauburji is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab. ==Impact of Metro construction== The Chauburji monument is situated along the planned route of the Orange Line of the Lahore Metro. Heritage campaigners submitted a petition to the Lahore High Court as the planned metro line will pass close to Chauburji, Shalimar Gardens, and nine other sites in the city in violation of the Punjab Special Premises Ordinance, 1985 and Antiquity Act, 1975. In August 2016, the Court halted construction of the metro within 200 feet of any heritage site, including Chauburji in order to prevent what UNESCO termed as potentially \\"irreversible damage,\\" were the line to be constructed in its present form. The Chauburji station was originally planned to be underground, but it was changed to an elevated station to comply with the UNESCO regulations. ==Gallery== File:Traditional_Mughal_Art,_Chauburji,_Lahore.jpgAn example of Chauburji's Persian-style tilework.

He officiated at two FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998 and 2002; he was appointed fourth official for the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final. Dallas also officiated at the 1996 Olympic Games, the 1999 UEFA Cup Final and several UEFA Champions League matches. From June 2009 until November 2010, Dallas was the SFA's Referee Development Officer. He is a UEFA Referee Officer. ==Refereeing career== Dallas was born in Allanton, near Shotts. He refereed his first amateur match in 1982 between Motherwell Bridgeworks and Victoria AFC. His first foreign engagement came in 1988 when he was a linesman at a Cup Winners' Cup tie between Sampdoria and Carl Zeiss Jena. While running the line at the 1993 Toulon Tournament, Dallas stopped a match between Czechoslovakia and Portugal after spotting a serious injury to Czech player Martin Svedik. Dallas was credited with saving the player's life and thanked by Ivan Kopecky, the coach of the Czech team, for his intervention. Early in his career, Dallas took the advice of Brian McGinlay and began to referee international matches in a different way to those in Scotland. Dallas contends that foreign players dive more than their Scottish counterparts and that the diving of foreign players who enter Scottish football is reduced by Scottish match officials. Dallas was one of 12 referees selected to officiate at the 1996 Summer Olympics in the USA. During the tournament Dallas was the referee at three group matches. In June 1997, Dallas refereed an important 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification match between Spain and the Czech Republic. Early in the second half, Alfonso P√©rez fell over in the Czech penalty area at least two metres away from Czech goalkeeper Pavel Srn√≠ƒçek, but Dallas awarded a penalty kick to Spain. In 2003, Dallas rated the mistake as the worst of his career. Dallas admitted to embarrassment and guilt after the match, as the penalty kick proved decisive in giving a 1‚Äì0 win to Spain. Their defeat cost the Czech Republic any chance of qualifying for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. UEFA offered Dallas police protection after he awarded Italy a late penalty in their 2‚Äì1 win over Turkey at Euro 2000. Dallas' former colleague Brian McGinlay said that the penalty decision was wrong, but nevertheless claimed Dallas was \\"the best referee in Britain.\\" Dallas was the fourth official in the semi‚Äìfinal match between France and Portugal.http://www.espnfc.com/euro2000/news/20000629uefaportugal.html Dallas was not disappointed to miss the final as he \\"never imagined that the final was a possibility.'\\"Dallas Passed Over For Final Ties\\". Scottish Daily Record. 27 June 2000. During the routine review of matches, Dallas' performance in the early matches was given the equivalent of a gold star by UEFA committee member Ken Ridden. The committee were also impressed by his man management skills. Dallas presided over AC Milan's exit from the 2000‚Äì01 UEFA Champions League, in a 1‚Äì1 draw at the San Siro. The crowd pelted Dallas with missiles including coins, fruit, bottles and cigarette lighters as he left the field under police protection. Celtic v Rangers 1999 In May 1999, Dallas presided over an important Old Firm fixture. Celtic needed to beat Rangers in this match to prevent them winning the Scottish Premier League championship at Celtic Park. The match was given a Sunday evening kick-off for reasons of live Sky Sports television coverage. The match had a frenzied start, with Dallas penalising two fouls within the first minute. Play was later stopped for several minutes while Dallas received treatment after being hit on the head by a coin thrown by a Celtic supporter. Over the course of the match at least four Celtic fans invaded the field of play to confront Dallas, while another Celtic fan fell from an upper section of terracing and was taken to hospital. Rangers won the match 3‚Äì0 and therefore the league championship. Later that evening, a brick was thrown through a window in Dallas' home. A behavioural psychologist was hired by Celtic to investigate Dallas, with the report largely supported Dallas' performance and instead blamed the behaviour of players. Since the events of that day, Old Firm league matches have normally been played in the early afternoon and the possibility of an Old Firm title decider has been deliberately avoided. 1998 FIFA World Cup The first match at the 1998 FIFA World Cup for Dallas was a 2‚Äì2 draw between Mexico and Belgium. He sent off Pavel Pardo and Gert Verheyen during the match. Dallas was also the referee for the quarter final match between Italy and France. More than a decade later, Dallas admitted to surprise and disappointment at being overlooked for the later stages of the competition. 2002 FIFA World Cup During the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament, Portugal objected to Dallas' selection for their group-stage game with Poland, referring to their experience with Dallas during UEFA Euro 2000. Portugal went on to win the match 4‚Äì0. Dallas refereed the quarter‚Äìfinal between the USA and Germany. Early in the second half, he declined to award a penalty kick to the USA after a shot by Gregg Berhalter was blocked on the goalline by the outstretched arm of defender Torsten Frings. Dallas defended his decision on the grounds that Frings did not intend to handle the ball, commenting \\"If it's not intentional it's not a foul, no matter where it is.\\" In the same match Dallas cautioned Oliver Neuville for a foul committed by his teammate Jens Jeremies, having mistaken their identities. Dallas had the backing of his refereeing inspector over the incident, although FIFA remarked upon their \\"concern [at] one or two major mistakes.\\" Dallas was selected as fourth official for the Final between Brazil and Germany. According to Dallas, the Brazilian players insisted he join them following their celebratory team huddle dance around the World Cup trophy. ==Head of Referee Development== Dallas retired as a match referee at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 Scottish football season, a year earlier than the mandatory retirement age. He then acted as a referee observer for the Scottish Premier League and was appointed to the UEFA Referees' Committee. Dallas was also appointed to a new Referee Certification Panel, one of two panels introduced in connection with UEFA's Referee Convention, while he continued his role as a UEFA referee observer. Dallas was appointed Head of Referee Development by the Scottish Football Association in 2009. He was soon involved in a public dispute with Motherwell manager Jim Gannon over refereeing decisions. In February 2010, Dallas expressed disappointment at refereeing standards in the SPL, after several high-profile refereeing errors were made in a short period of time. In November 2010, assistant referee Steven Craven accused Dallas of exerting pressure on him to support referee Dougie McDonald, who had lied about a disallowed penalty incident in a match at Tannadice Park. Dallas himself had initially publicly repeated McDonald's false version of events but denied allegations of \\"bullying and harassment\\". Dallas was supported personally by the SFA, though the body promised an overhaul of referee discipline. Later in November 2010, Dallas faced an inquiry after it emerged that he had allegedly sent what has been described as a sectarian and offensive email referring to the Pope from his SFA email account. After journalist Phil Mac Giolla Bhain had broken the story, the SFA issued a statement on 10 November stating that an investigation would be carried out. On 24 November, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland wrote to the SFA demanding that they remove Dallas from his position if the allegation was proved. Dallas was sacked by the SFA on 26 November, after chief executive Stewart Regan had concluded the investigation into the allegations. Four other SFA employees were also sacked; three of whom were later reinstated. Dallas planned to sue the SFA for unfair dismissal, but the case was settled before it reached court. After Dallas was sacked there was concern from referees in Scotland that standards of officiating could drop. Fifa listed Scottish referee Craig Thomson said, \\"I see him as a world-class individual within Scottish football, There is a lot of work behind the scenes that I'm hoping won't be lost.\\" Referee John McKendrick said, \\"It's certainly a major blow for Scottish refereeing, At the peak of his game, there are very few figures in Scottish football who have been at the level Hugh Dallas was at.\\" In August 2014, he was appointed Chief Refereeing Officer in Superleague Greece. In November 2014, he criticised the arbitration of Ilias Spathas (one of the many refs involved in the 2015 Greek football scandal), after a match of Olympiakos, as the \\"worst he has ever seen\\" saying that the mistakes were not normal. A few days later he quit from being responsible for the appointments of refereeing officials for Super League and Football League matches. ==Outside football== Dallas was the managing director of his own window and construction company, until it went into receivership in 2002. In December 2002, Dallas was awarded an MBE for his services to football. As discovered by TV show Fantasy Football League, Dallas was once a contestant on Family Fortunes. Dallas has also worked as an after-dinner speaker. His son Andrew is also a referee. Dallas replaced Pierluigi Collina at Soccer Aid 2008, after Collina was injured. Scottish band Mogwai named a song after Dallas which was included in the 2014 re-release of Come On Die Young ==ReferencesExternal links== * Article by Dallas on refereeing Old Firm matches Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from North Lanarkshire Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Scottish football referees Category:UEFA Champions League referees Category:1998 FIFA World Cup referees Category:2002 FIFA World Cup referees Category:Olympic football referees Category:UEFA Euro 2000 referees ","title":"Hugh Dallas"},{"id":"5565983","text":"Sylvia Legris (born 1960) is a Canadian poet.

When the serpent tells Eve to bite the apple, Adam takes it away from her. The serpent then tells her to go into hysterics and Adam will give her the apple. Shifting to the modern story, Mrs. Orrin (Effie Shannon), Eve's (Constance Talmadge) mother, goes into hysterics at the thought of losing her daughter. Mrs. Orrin and Mrs. Merchant (Katharine Kaelred), who lives with them, have decided that Eve will marry Mrs. Merchant's son Henry (George LeGuere), an effeminate youngster with rimmed glasses. Fearing her mother's nerves, Eve is willing to marry Henry, so the four of them go to Mama Orrin's birthplace, where the wedding is scheduled to take place on her birthday. During the stay at the hotel Mama has one of her \\"attacks\\" and Dr. Harmon (Kenneth Harlan) is called in. He soon discovers the exact trouble and orders Mrs. Orrin to bed with instructions that she not even see her daughter. Mrs. Orrin disobeys these orders and then Eve's nerves give way, causing a second visit by the doctor. He takes Eve away from the mother, but after Henry accuses the doctor of being a fortune seeker, the doctor refuses to have anything to do with Eve. Finally, Eve's eyes are opened and she uses a \\"treat 'em rough\\" theory on her mother. Besides winning the love of her doctor, she cures her mother of her hysterics. ==Cast== * Constance Talmadge as Eve Orrin * Effie Shannon as Mrs. Orrin * Kenneth Harlan as Dr. Harmon * George Le Guere as Henry Marchant * Katharine Kaelred as Mrs. Marchant * Gertrude Le Brandt as Bundy ==Psychoanalytic elements== Plot elements involving Eve's genuine fit of hysteria before the planned wedding, the doctor's simple cure of removing Eve from her mother, and Eve's subsequent immediate recovery and ability to live an independent life were consistent with then-current popular understandings of Sigmund Freud's theories of repression and the causation of neurosis.

One island platform was taken out of use when the line was reduced back to double track, the overgrown remains of the disused platform can still be seen. The station also lost its original canopies, and platform buildings, being reduced to a single platform building. Platform canopies were constructed once again in 2007-08, but not to the former GWR scale. Until 1967 the former GWR London Paddington - Birkenhead Woodside train services passed through the station but few stopped there; these services ceased with the electrification of the former LMS line from London Euston to Birmingham New Street.

At the wedding announcement, since her father the former Seigneur of Pontiac died intestate and no will could be found, Madelinette is to receive $10,000 so she can continue her operatic studies. Tardiff (Campeau), a former servant of the Seigneur, mocks Louis' new title and hints that a will is hidden somewhere and is certain to be found. Tardiff's interruption of the festivities results in a fight in which Louis is flung against a tree and injured.

They have just left Earth to begin the journey home when Miles is dispatched by Emperor Gregor Vorbarra to Graf Station in Quaddiespace to untangle a diplomatic incident in his capacity as the nearest Imperial Auditor. There, he is unexpectedly reunited with the Betan hermaphrodite Bel Thorne, a trusted former Dendarii Mercenaries subordinate and his good friend. Quaddies are the result of genetic manipulation centuries before, as described in the novel Falling Free. Intended to be used as laborers in zero-G before the invention of artificial gravity, they have extra arms instead of legs, along with many physiological alterations. At Graf Station the Quaddies occupy a zero-G section of the station while visitors use a section with artificial gravity. Quaddies tend to be suspicious of other humans based on a history of callous exploitation. A convoy of Komarran merchant ships are being prevented from leaving the station due to trouble caused by Barrayaran personnel from their military escort. Furthermore, a Barrayaran security officer is missing, possibly murdered or deserted. While investigating, Miles uncovers a plot by a high-ranking Cetagandan to steal a cargo of extreme importance to the Cetagandans and hide its tracks, if necessary, by putting the blame on Barrayar.

Ordained in 1936 and named archbishop in 1972, he was secretary of the commission that worked on the reform of the Catholic liturgy that followed the Second Vatican Council. Critics of the changes made to the Catholic Mass and other liturgical practices before and after Vatican II consider him a controversial figure. He held several other posts in the Roman Curia and ended his career as papal nuncio to Iran, where he acted as an intermediary during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979‚Äì1981. ==Early life and ordination== Annibale Bugnini was born in Civitella del Lago in Umbria.Davies, Michael. How the liturgy fell apart: the enigma of Archbishop Bugnini AD2000, June 1989, retrieved 30 September 2016. In 1928 he began his theological studies with the Congregation of the Mission and was ordained a priest on 26 July 1936. He completed his doctorate in sacred theology at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum in 1938 with a dissertation entitled De liturgia eiusque momento in Concilio Tridentino. Accessed 30 December 2014 He spent ten years in parish work in a suburb of Rome. In 1947 Bugnini became involved in the production of the missionary publications of his order and became the first editor of Ephemerides Liturgic√¶, a scholarly journal dedicated to the reform of the Catholic liturgy. Starting in 1949, he taught Liturgical Studies at the Pontifical Urban College (now the Pontifical Urban University). He later became a professor at the Pontifical Lateran University. ==Curial career== On 28 May 1948, Pope Pius XII appointed Bugnini Secretary to the Commission for Liturgical Reform, which created a revised rite for the Easter Vigil in 1951 and revised ceremonies for the rest of Holy Week in 1955. The Commission also made changes in 1955 to the rubrics of the Mass and Office, suppressing many of the Church's octaves and a number of vigils, and abolishing the First Vespers of most feasts. In 1960 the Commission modified the Code of Rubrics, which led to new editions of the Roman Breviary in 1961 and of the Roman Missal in 1962.Davies, Michael. Pope Paul's New Mass, Angelus Press 1980, p.497. On 25 January 1959, Pope John XXIII announced his plan to convene the Second Vatican Council. On 6 June 1960 Fr. Bugnini was named Secretary of the Pontifical Preparatory Commission on the Liturgy. This body produced the first drafts of the document that, after many changes, would become the Council's Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (1963). When the Council convened in October 1962, the Preparatory Commission was succeeded by the Conciliar Commission on the Sacred Liturgy, on which Bugnini was assigned the role of a peritus (expert). At the same time, Bugnini was removed from the chair of Liturgy at the Pontifical Lateran University because, in the words of Piero Marini, \\"his liturgical ideas were seen as too progressive.\\" In his posthumously published memoirs, Second Vatican Council consultant Louis Bouyer called Bugnini ‚Äúa man as bereft of culture as he was of basic honesty.‚Äù The Council and Pope Paul VI approved the Constitution on the Liturgy on 4 December 1963. On 30 January 1964, the Pope appointed Bugnini Secretary of the Council for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy. Bugnini was appointed the Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship by Pope Paul in May 1969. In January 1965, he had become an undersecretary in the Congregation of Rites responsible for causes for beatification and canonization. On 6 January 1972 Pope Paul named Bugnini Titular Archbishop of Diocletiana and consecrated him as bishop on the following 13 February. On 16 July 1975 Pope Paul announced the merger of two curial departments to form the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, ending Bugnini's career in the Roman Curia. His personal secretary was Piero Marini, who is now an Archbishop and President of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses. ==Diplomatic service== On 4 January 1976 Pope Paul named Bugnini pro-nuncio to Iran. Bugnini studied the country, its history, and traditions. The results of his researches appeared in 1981 as La Chiesa in Iran (The Church in Iran). In 1979 Bugnini tried unsuccessfully to obtain, in the name of the pope, the release of the American hostages being held at the United States embassy by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He met with Khomeini to deliver Pope John Paul II's appeal for the release of the hostages. The 52 Americans were released on 21 January 1981, after 444 days in captivity. ==Death== Bugnini died of natural causes at the Pope Pius XI Clinic in Rome on 3 July 1982. His detailed account of the work to which he devoted most of his career, The Reform of the Liturgy 1948-1975, appeared posthumously. An English translation appeared in 1990. ==Allegation== The oft- repeated allegation of Bugnini's being a Freemason was first made in print by Italian essayist Tito Casini in his book Nel Fumo di Satana. Verso l'ultimo scontro (Florence: Il carro di San Giovanni, 1976). According to Casini‚Äôs anonymous source, Bugnini left a briefcase in a conference room. When someone found it and attempted to identify the owner, incriminating documents were within. English writer Michael Davies traced Pope Paul VI‚Äôs sending of Bugnini to Iran as nuncio to this alleged revelation of Bugnini‚Äôs Masonic affiliation, though the task of his post-Vatican II congregation had just been completed (supra). Davies asserted that an unnamed, conservative Cardinal told him in the summer of 1975 that he'd \\"seen (or placed) on the pope's desk\\" a \\"dossier\\" containing evidence of Bugnini's Freemason connection. ==Notes== Category:1912 births Category:1983 deaths Category:People from the Province of Terni Category:Vincentians Category:Liturgists Category:Pontifical Lateran University faculty Category:Italian titular archbishops Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Vincentian bishops Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Iran ","title":"Annibale Bugnini"},{"id":"5566072","text":"Way Back to the Bone is an album by the band Trapeze of previously released material from 1970-1972.

He graduated from its gymnasium. His brother was Selig Cassel. Cassel's name is intimately connected with the founders of Jewish science in Germany‚ÄîZunz, Geiger, Steinschneider, Frankel, and others. In appreciating his great scholarship in Jewish literature it must not be forgotten that he was born in a city in which Jewish learning had been maintained at a very high standard, and which has given to the world many noted scholars: Salomon Munk, Joseph Zedner, Michael Sachs, Heymann Arnheim, and others. Cassel became a student at the Berlin University, where he attended the lectures of the orientalist Julius Heinrich Petermann, the philosopher Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, the philologist Philipp August Boeckh, and others. He, besides, maintained very friendly relations with Moritz Steinschneider, Heimann Jolowicz, Leser Landshuth, and Paul de Lagarde. During the whole time of his university studies he supported himself by giving lessons; and having thus experienced all the bitterness of poverty, he became later one of the founders of the H√ºlfs-Verein f√ºr J√ºdische Studierende, a society for assisting poor Jewish students in Berlin, which is still in existence. Cassel began his career as an author with his doctor's thesis on \\"Die Psalmen√ºberschriften\\" (published in the \\"Literaturblatt des Orients,\\" Leipzig, 1840). He received his rabbinical diploma in 1843 from Jacob Joseph Oettinger and Zecharias Frankel, but never accepted, a rabbinical position, although he possessed a decided talent for the pulpit, as may be seen from his \\"Sabbath-Stunden zur Belehrung und Erbauung\\" (Berlin, 1868), a collection of 52 homilies on the Pentateuch, originally delivered as Sabbath lectures in a school for boys. In 1846 Cassel became principal of an educational institute called the \\"Dina-Nauen-Stift,\\" in which position he remained until 1879. He was, besides, in 1850 and 1851 teacher of religion in Berlin at the Congregational School for Jewish Girls, and from 1852 to 1867 at the Jewish school for boys. From 1862 to 1873 he was also a teacher at the Jewish Normal School. In 1872, when the Lehranstalt f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judenthums (\\"Hochschule\\") was established in Berlin, Cassel was elected one of the docents. He died in Berlin. ==Works== Cassel wrote a great number of valuable books, besides many essays for the Jewish magazines. Some of his works were written mainly for educational purposes; e.g., the above-mentioned \\"Sabbath- Stunden\\" and the following: * \\"Leitfaden f√ºr den Unterricht in der J√ºdischen Gesch. und Litteratur,\\" Berlin, 1868 (translated into various languages); * \\"Gesch. der J√ºdischen Litteratur,\\" 2 vols., Berlin, 1872‚Äì73, dealing only with Biblical literature; * \\"Hebr√§isch-Deutsches W√∂rterbuch,\\" etc., Berlin, 1871, last ed., 1891; * \\"Lehrbuch der J√ºdischen Gesch. und Litteratur,\\" Leipzig, 1879; 2d ed., Berlin, 1896. In addition to these he edited, or contributed introductions and notes to, several scientific works of great value, of which the following may be mentioned: * \\"Cat. Hebr√§ischer Schriften,\\" Latin part by himself, and Hebrew by Rebenstein (Bernstein), Berlin, 1845; * David Conforte's \\"·∏≤ore ha-Dorot,\\" a biographical and bibliographical lexicon of Jewish scholars with introduction and notes, Berlin, 1846; * \\"Zikron Yehudah,\\" responsa of Judah ben Asher, published by Rosenberg, with introduction and notes by Cassel, Berlin, 1846; * \\"Teshubot Geonim ·∏≤admonim,\\" responsa of the earlier Geonim, edited from a Berlin manuscript, with an introduction by J. L. Rapoport, in \\"He-·∏§alu·∫ì,\\" Berlin, 1848, viii.138; * the \\"Yesod 'Olam\\" of Isaac Israeli, an astronomical work edited by B. Goldberg and L. Rosenkranz, with an introduction and a German translation by Cassel, Berlin, 1848; published by Rosenberg with notes and references by Cassel, Berlin, 1856; * Index to De Rossi's \\"Dizionario Storico,\\" Leipzig, 1846; * the \\"Cuzari\\" of Judah ha-Levi, with a German introduction and translation and very numerous explanatory and critical notes, which fully testify to Cassel's erudition in Jewish-Arabic philosophy, Leipzig, 1840‚Äì53, Berlin, 1869 (in this work Cassel was assisted to some extent by H. Jolowicz); * \\"Meor 'Enayim\\" of Azariah dei Rossi‚Äîa classical edition, Vilna, 1866; * the Apocrypha, translated into German from the Greek, Berlin, 1864‚Äì71; * \\"Die Pesach-Haggadah\\", with German introduction, translation, and critical notes (latest edition, Berlin, 1895); * \\"Grammatik der Hebr√§ischen Sprache\\" of H. Arnheim (died 1870), with introduction, notes, and additions by Cassel, Berlin, 1872. Cassel further wrote pamphlets on questions of the day, such as: \\"Woher und Wohin? Zur Verst√§ndigung √ºber J√ºdische Reformbestrebungen,\\" Berlin, 1845; * \\"Die Cultusfrage in der J√ºdischen Gemeinde von Berlin,\\" Berlin, 1856, a defense of his friend Michael Sachs against the attacks by the Orthodox; * \\"Offener Brief eines Juden an Prof. Dr. Virchow,\\" Berlin, 1869; * \\"Joseph Caro und das Buch Maggid Mesharim,\\" published in the \\"Jahresbericht\\" of the Berlin Hochschule, Berlin, 1888, in which he proves, against Gr√§tz, that this book was not written by Caro. Cassel is also the author of all the articles dealing with Judaism and Jewish literature in Brockhaus' \\"Konversations-Lexikon\\". He also wrote articles for the publications of the Society of Hebrew Literature of London. Finally, it must be mentioned that Cassel, while still a young man, conceived the plan of publishing a Jewish encyclopedia containing everything of interest to Judaism. With the assistance of M. Steinschneider he composed the \\"Plan der Real-Encyclop√§die des Judenthums,\\" Krotoschin, 1844; but, inasmuch as Jewish studies were still in their infancy, the plan, though pursued for some time, could not be carried out. ==References== *Literature by and about David Cassel in University Library JCS Frankfurt am Main: Digital Collections Judaica * For the great number of articles written by Cassel for Jewish and Christian magazines and encyclopedias (e.g., the Allgemeine Encyklop√§die der Wissenschaften und K√ºnste of Ersch and Gruber) see Mo√Øse Schwab, R√©pertoire des Articles d'Histoire et de Litt√©rature Juive, Paris, 1900, s.v.

The station is operated by West Midlands Trains, and is also served by Chiltern Railways services. The entrance seen in the centre where the station's booking office is located leads into a tunnel which runs under the tracks providing an access staircase and lift to the island platform. The station also has a car park and bicycle racks. ==History== Origins Olton station was opened in 1869 on the GWR's Oxford & Birmingham Branch and its prime role was as a suburban passenger station for Birmingham commuters, explaining why the booking office was located on the down platform. Olton originally had two signal boxes, the first of which only had 10 levers. It was built by McKenzie and Holland and located at the end of the up platform which was replaced in June 1913 but was ultimately closed in 1933. Expansion Olton station originally had a two-platform configuration with basic facilities, but taking advantage of the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act of 1929, the Great Western Railway continued to quadruple the Birmingham Main Line as far as Lapworth, rebuilding five stations including Olton with two wide island platforms in 1932. Current layout The station was rebuilt in the 1930s and the new approach 'Station Drive' was also constructed. The station now has one wide island platform with trains to , and London stopping one side and to Birmingham and Worcester the other. The platform building has been significantly reduced by the removal of its roof canopy. ==Incidents == Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham, discussing railway accidents in the city, notes that: ==Services== The station is served by three trains per hour in each direction between and .

The awards were founded and produced by Tim Progosh in 2000. The CCA have been held in different cities, most often in Toronto and London, Ontario. Between 2003 and 2015, the awards were held as part of the Canadian Comedy Awards Festival, with showcase performances by nominees and other comedic talent. The Comedy Network broadcast the first two award ceremonies and several specials of festival performances. These broadcasts have earned two Gemini Award nominations. The awards are artist- driven with a mandate \\"To recognize, celebrate and promote Canadian achievements in comedy at home and abroad.\\" They are run through a non-profit organization and volunteer committees, drawing membership from the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA), the Canadian Actors' Equity Association (CAEA), the Directors Guild of Canada (DGC), the Writers Guild of Canada (WGC), and the Comedy Association. Some awards are determined by industry members while others are open to public voting. ==History== Actor, director and producer Tim Progosh founded the Canadian Comedy Awards (CCA) after touring for over 20 years in sketch, improv and stand-up comedy. He felt that there was a distance between stand-up comedians and other comedic artists, and that stand-up and comedy as a whole wasn't receiving adequate national recognition. With the establishment of The Comedy Network in late 1997, Progosh felt the time was right to create a national comedy award and comedy hall of fame. Progosh brought together an advisory board which included himself, Mark Breslin of Yuk Yuk's comedy clubs, Andrew Alexander of The Second City, Sydd Capp, and representatives from the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA), the Canadian Actors' Equity Association (CAEA), the Directors Guild of Canada (DGC) and the Writers Guild of Canada (WGC). Award categories were created for live comedy, film and television, with the mandate \\"To recognize, celebrate and promote Canadian achievements in comedy at home and abroad.\\" Philanthropist Bluma Appel helped to establish the awards, and supported a bursary for emerging comics. Breslin noted that it was the first time \\"that anyone from the Canadian establishment took comedy seriously.\\" The first Canadian Comedy Awards ceremony was held in 2000 at Toronto's Masonic Temple. The Comedy Network televised the first two annual awards ceremonies, but due to lack of sponsorship the broadcast deal ended in 2001. In 2003, non-profit organization the Canadian Comedy Foundation for Excellence (CCFE) was incorporated to organize and promote the awards, and the ceremonies moved from Toronto to London, Ontario. The CCFE also organized the Canadian Comedy Awards Festival (CCAF), with showcase performances by the nominees in sketch, stand-up and improvisational comedy, workshops, seminars and special events leading up to the awards gala. As the festival grew during the following years, The Comedy Network began broadcasting Best of the Fest variety specials. Following sponsorship, the CCFA moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, in 2008 and Saint John, New Brunswick, in 2009. The awards then returned to Toronto, which could more easily accommodate the festival which then had 38 shows over five days. During this period, categories were also broadened and added to recognize emerging media such as podcasts and web series. In 2013, the awards moved to Ottawa and had its first francophone presence at the festival. In 2015, the license for the awards expired and control of the Canadian Comedy Awards reverted to the trademark holder, Funny Business, Inc. During this same period, Progosh and the CCFE decided to focus on creating a home for the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame. The awards were put on hold until the spring of 2016. Due to budget and time limitations, the industry award categories were suspended for the transitional year and only the public voting categories were considered. Two additional public categories ‚Äì Best Live Production and Best Live Ensemble ‚Äì were added to compensate for the lack of industry categories. The 18th awards similarly covered an 18-month eligibility period and were held in 2018. Thereafter, the awards returned to a yearly schedule, considering the works of the previous calendar year. ==Governing body== Until 2015, the CCA were organized by the Canadian Comedy Foundation for Excellence (CCFE), a non-profit corporation registered in 2003. Its volunteer committees sought input from comedy professionals on all aspects of the awards: criteria, marketing, programming and communications. The Membership and Communications Committee promoted industry awareness and participation in the awards, oversaw all communications to and from the membership, and advised and coordinated with media coverage. The Nominations and Awards Committee oversaw the nomination process, category criteria, jury committees, voting procedures, trophies and prizes. The Programming Committee developed programs and organized talent for various events, the awards gala, and community events. The CCA membership is made up of industry professionals, largely from the following member organizations: *Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) ‚Äì represents 22,000 performers in English-language media. *Canadian Actors' Equity Association (CAEA) ‚Äì represents 6,000 professionals in English Canadian theatre, including actors, dancers, opera singers, theatre directors, choreographers and stage managers. *Writers Guild of Canada (WGC) ‚Äì represents 2,200 professional writers in English-language film, television, radio, and digital media. *Directors Guild of Canada (DGA) ‚Äì represents 4,800 professionals in 48 occupations in film and television *The Comedy Association ‚Äì represents talent, workers and management of comedy clubs and festivals (including Yuk Yuk's, The Second City, and Just for Laughs). ==Awards and categories== Writing on the inaugural awards ceremony, Alan Neister described the trophies as \\"Plexiglas maple leaves, etched with the outline of a happy, dancing beaver.\\" In some ceremonies, awards have been give for being \\"pretty funny\\" in each category instead of \\"best\\". the CCA has awarded a total of Beavers. The number of award categories recognized at each ceremony has most often been between 19 and 24, though categories added for Internet and multimedia works saw the categories peak at 30 in the mid-2010s. Time and budget limitations resulted in the categories being reduced to 9 in 2016. Following this transitional year the number of categories was streamlined to 22, largely by combining the award categories for male and female performers. Categories are divided by format, organized into those for live performances (including stand-up, improvisation, and plays), television, and film. Internet media was added in 2008 and categories that considered works across different formats were labelled as multimedia. Current categories Public voting categories: *Comedic Artist of the Year (since 2008) *Best Live Production (since 2016) *Best Taped Live Performance (since 2005) *Best Live Ensemble (since 2016) *Best Standup Comic (since 2000) *Best Variety Act (since 2014) *Best Breakout Artist (since 2013) *Best Feature (since 2011) *Best TV Show (since 2011) *Best Web Series (since 2012) *Best Short (since 2013) *Best Audio Show or Series (since 2012) *Best Comedy Album (since 2017) Industry voting categories: *Best Performance in a Feature (since 2000) *Best Writing in a Feature (since 2000) *Best Direction in a Feature (since 2000) *Best Performance in a TV Series (since 2000) *Best Writing in a TV Series or Special (since 2000) *Best Direction in a TV Series or Special (since 2000) *Best Performance in a Web Series (since 2014) *Best Writing in a Web Series (since 2014) *Best Direction in a Web Series (since 2014) Notes: : not awarded in 2016, a transitional year : awarded separately to male and female performers, 2001‚Äì2015 : awarded separately to male and female performers, 2000‚Äì2015 : awarded separately for series and specials, 2000‚Äì2009 : awarded separately to male and female performers, 2014‚Äì2015 : web series and TV series had shared direction, writing and performance categories in 2013 Discontinued categories *Best Radio Program or Clip (2008‚Äì2013), Best Audio Clip (2014) *Best Stand-up, Large Venue (2008 only) *Best Stand-up Newcomer (2000‚Äì2012, replaced with Best Breakout Artist) *Best Sketch Troupe (2000‚Äì2015, merged into Best Live Ensemble) *Best Improv Troupe (2001‚Äì2015, merged into Best Live Ensemble) *Best Newcomer, Sketch Troupe (2000 only) *Best Male Improviser (2001‚Äì2015) *Best Female Improviser (2001‚Äì2015) *Best Live Performance Male (2000 only) *Best Live Performance Female (2000 only) *Best Playwriting (2000 only) *Best Direction, New Play (2000 only) *Best Direction, Existing Play (2000 only) *Best New Play (2001-2002) *Best One Person Show (2001‚Äì2015, merged into Best Live Production) *Best Comedic Play, Revue or Series (2003-2015, merged into Best Live Production) *Best Television Performance by an Ensemble (2009‚Äì2012) *Best Ensemble Performance in a TV or Web Series (2013 only) *Best Film Writing, Adapted (2000 only) *Best Original Screenplay (2000 only) *Best Web Clip (2008‚Äì2012, replaced with Best Short) Special award categories Juried categories were discontinued in 2016. These panels had previously given awards for special achievement including lifetime achievement awards and awards for non-artists who had made significant contributions to Canadian comedy. The juries also inducted people into the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame. *The Bluma Appel \\"That's Funny\\" Award (2001) established by philanthropist Bluma Appel (d.2007). *Chairman's Award (2004‚Äì2010) *Dave Broadfoot Award (2004‚Äì2014) for comic genius, named for Canadian comedy pioneer Dave Broadfoot (1925‚Äì2016) and established by the Royal Canadian Air Farce. * Phil Hartman Award (2012‚Äì2015) for an individual \\"who makes the Canadian comedy community better\\". Established in honour of Canadian-American comic, actor and screenwriter Phil Hartman (1948‚Äì1999), it has been awarded to open mic host Jo-Anna Downey, and comedians Mike MacDonald, Kenny Robinson, and producer Joe Bodolai who helped found The Comedy Network. Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame The CCA established the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame and inducted its first members in 2000. In 2013, a permanent home was sought for the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame and the CCA presented proposals to the cities of Hamilton, Niagara Falls, and Ottawa, Ontario. The cities declined due to uncertainties of funding. The Just for Laughs Museum in Montreal had closed in 2011 after operating at a loss. The proposal had called for an interactive museum with a comedy club for performances. In lieu of a permanent museum, interactive exhibits were set up at ByWard Market during the 2014 CCAF, and school groups were invited to participate in workshops. ==Nominations and voting== Nominees for a CCA must be Canadian citizens or landed immigrants, have been born in Canada or have produced the majority of their work in Canada. Other criteria varied year by year, but generally the eligibility period was the previous calendar year; works had to have premiered in Canada during that period and live performers had to have performed in Canada at least once during that period. In some years there was a nominal fee for the first person to nominate a person or work; in 2018 this fee was $20. From 2000 to 2015, the nomination process involved about 170 jury members selected each year by the CCFE. The jury members, whose identities were kept secret, would vote on the nominees submitted through the CCA website. Their top five selections in each category would become the final nominees, voted on by the CCA membership. The jury's votes were weighted for about 30% of the final result. Voting was conducted online since 2000, making the CCA one of the first national awards in Canada to have online voting. Two-minute clips of nominees were made available online, allowing nominees to gain exposure across the industry. Public voting was introduced by 2008, initially limited to a few categories. In 2016, time and budget issues precluded organizing any industry-voting categories, so public-voting was expanded to nine categories. When industry awards returned the following year, rather than a jury there were two rounds of voting. In the first round, members chose up to five nominees for each category; these were totalled and the top five became the final nominees for a second round of voting. ==Ceremonies and festivals== The awards ceremonies have been described as placing \\"gags over glamour\\", with wit and improvisational skill shown by hosts, presenters and recipients. Leatrice Spevack of The Globe and Mail noted that the CCAs stood above other award shows on its entertaining acceptance speeches. Festivals CCA Festivals were held each year from 2002 to 2015. The festivals took place over three to five days, depending on sponsorship and the availability of talent, volunteers, and venues. The awards ceremony was held either on the final evening, or on the second-last evening with a Last Laughs Gala on the final night. The largest festivals had two to three dozens events, with more than one hundred performers. Comedy shows featured the nominees and comics from the host region, with stand-up, sketch, improv and one-person shows, competitive improvisational games, seminars, workshops, and interactive exhibits. Some festivals have also included celebrity hockey games with comedians and alumni of the host city's professional hockey team. Host cities and venues Cities in Ontario have hosted all but two of the CCA award ceremonies. Toronto has most frequently hosted the awards, including the first ceremony and the most recent, in 2019. Galas have been held at historic venues including the Masonic Temple, the Winter Garden Theatre, the Isabel Bader Theatre, and the Imperial Room of the Royal York hotel, and at clubs The Guvernment and The Docks. CCAF events have been held at the city's comedy clubs including Yuk Yuk's, Second City, Comedy Bar, and Bad Dog Theatre, and showcase performances have been held at the Panasonic Theatre. London hosted the longest run of the awards, from 2003 to 2007. The CCA Festival began during this period, growing from three to five days of events. The CCA were hosted by Ottawa for two years, with the awards ceremony held at Centrepointe Theatre in 2013 and the Ottawa Little Theatre in 2014. Other CCAF venues in the nation's capital included Yuk Yuk's, Absolute Comedy, Arts Council Theatre, Bell Sensplex, and ByWard Market. Regina, Saskatchewan, hosted the awards and festival in 2008. In 2009, the festival was hosted by Saint John, New Brunswick, with the awards ceremony and Last Laugh Gala held at the Imperial Theatre. Telecast The first awards ceremony was held at Toronto's Masonic Temple, which CTV Television Network had equipped as a television studio in the late 1990s. The ceremony was recorded for television, produced by Higher Ground Productions and directed by Bob Sorger. A one-hour version of the ceremony was broadcast on CTV at midnight on the night of Friday 7 April 2000, with the full program airing on The Comedy Network on 9 April at 9 pm. The special was well-received by the members of the industry it represents, who awarded Sorger the Beaver for best direction of a TV special or episode in 2001. The 2001 ceremony was also televised and was nominated for a Gemini Award for best writing in a comedy or variety program. In 2001, Bell Globemedia (now Bell Media) became the sole shareholder of The Comedy Network, and decided to discontinue sponsoring and televising the awards ceremony. In 2006, a gala review which closed the CCA Festival was taped and broadcast by The Comedy Network. The following year, showcase performances were taped and aired by The Comedy Network as two variety specials. The Doo Wops ‚Äì John Catucci and David Mesiano ‚Äì were nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Ensemble Performance in a Comedy Program for Canadian Comedy Awards 2007: Best of the Fest. In 2008, another Best of the Fest special was taped and broadcast by The Comedy Network. In 2009, for the 10th CCA, The Comedy Network taped the awards ceremony and Last Laugh Gala for later broadcast. The Comedy Network also taped The Canadian Comedy Awards 10th Anniversary Special, featuring Beaver-winning comedians from the past decade; this special was broadcast in May 2010. The Comedy Network drew criticism in 2013 for broadcasting the American Comedy Awards but not the CCAs. Some felt that the national comedy channel should produce its own programming and help develop and promote domestic talent, rather than importing programming from the US. ==Associated events== Various other shows have been organized under the Canadian Comedy Awards banner. These include the charity shows Canadian Comedy Award Nominees vs. Cancer, fundraisers for local charities, and benefits for comics suffering from illness. The CCA has also organized comedy shows for other performing arts festivals, such as Canada's Walk of Fame Festival. ==Criticism== Francophone exclusion It is noticeable that the CCA is focused on English Canada. In part this is due to the groups which make up its industry membership. ACTRA, the Canadian Actors' Equity Association, and the Writers Guild of Canada exclusively represent English Canada and English-language productions.McQuarrie, Ruth. Face to Face with Talent: Featur[ing] 2,400 Members of ACTRA and [of the] Canadian Actors' Equity Association. Toronto: ACTRA, [ca. 1985], [26], 618 p. Without ISBN. The Director's Guild of Canada has uneven representation in Quebec where certain film and television professions are represented by other unions. French-Canadian comedy is recognized at the French-language portion of the Just for Laughs Festival () in Montreal, Quebec. Francophone acts were first included at the CCA Festival in 2013, when the Awards were first held in Ottawa, a largely bilingual city on the Ontario‚ÄìQuebec border. The bilingual film Bon Cop, Bad Cop won three Beavers in 2007: for direction, writing and best male performance. Bilingual comic Mike Ward won Comedic Artist of the Year in 2016, and quadralingual comic Martha Chaves won Best Standup Comic in 2018. Absent categories The absence of a comedy album category was noted through most of the CCAs. Though historically important, comedy albums had fallen into decline in the 1980s and 1990s. Breslin explained poor album sales as a result of the dissemination of comedy through cable TV, the availability of concert videos which could be rented for less than the price of an album, and a general shift toward visual media. Although the mainstream audience moved away from albums, reduced production costs allowed comedy albums to go underground with niche- market material, such as that deemed too political or too explicit for television. Following a 17-year absence, the CCAs included a Best Comedy Album category in 2017. The following year, the Juno Awards revived an award for Comedy Album of the Year, which had been discontinued after 1984. It was also noted that there was an absence of categories for humour published in print media. The CCAs have focused on the performing arts, while humour in Canadian literature has been recognized by the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour. ==See also== *List of Canadian Comedy Awards ceremonies ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official Canadian Comedy Awards website Category:Canadian comedy and humour awards Category:Awards established in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in Canada ","title":"Canadian Comedy Awards"},{"id":"5566139","text":"Empty Hands is a lostThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: Empty Hands 1924 American silent romantic drama film directed by Victor Fleming, and starring Jack Holt and Norma Shearer.

A basic hyperbolic tree. Nodes in focus are placed in the center and given more room, while out-of-focus nodes are compressed near the boundaries. Focusing on a different node brings it and its children to the center of the disk, while uninteresting portions of the tree are compressed. Displaying hierarchical data as a tree suffers from visual clutter as the number of nodes per level can grow exponentially. For a simple binary tree, the maximum number of nodes at a level n is 2n, while the number of nodes for larger trees grows much more quickly. Drawing the tree as a node-link diagram thus requires exponential amounts of space to be displayed. One approach is to use a hyperbolic tree, first introduced by Lamping et al. Hyperbolic trees employ hyperbolic space, which intrinsically has \\"more room\\" than Euclidean space. For instance, linearly increasing the radius of a circle in Euclidean space increases its circumference linearly, while the same circle in hyperbolic space would have its circumference increase exponentially. Exploiting this property allows laying out the tree in hyperbolic space in an uncluttered manner: placing a node far enough from its parent gives the node almost the same amount of space as its parent for laying out its own children. Displaying a hyperbolic tree commonly utilizes the Poincar√© disk model of hyperbolic geometry, though the Klein-Beltrami model can also be used. Both display the entire hyperbolic plane within a unit disk, making the entire tree visible at once. The unit disk gives a fish-eye lens view of the plane, giving more emphasis to nodes which are in focus and displaying nodes further out of focus closer to the boundary of the disk. Traversing the hyperbolic tree requires M√∂bius transformations of the space, bringing new nodes into focus and moving higher levels of the hierarchy out of view. Hyperbolic trees were patented in the U.S. by Xerox in 1996, but the patent has since expired. == See also == * Hyperbolic geometry * Binary tiling * Information visualization * Radial tree ‚Äì is also circular, but uses linear geometry. * Tree (data structure) * Tree (graph theory) == References  External links == *d3-hypertree ‚Äì HTML5 Hyperbolic tree implementation, MIT licensed *Hyperbolic Tree of life ‚Äì Open source tree of life visualisation using Open Tree of Life data set *The Green Tree of Life ‚Äì Tree of life ‚Äì University of California at Berkeley and Jepson Herbaria *Tree of life Similar to the above, but with pictures *RougeViz supports hyperbolic trees.

He was also bishop of M√ºnster, Hildesheim, Freising and Li√®ge. Ernest was born in Munich, the son of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria, and Anna of Austria. Duke Albert had destined his third son, Ernest, for the clerical vocation. He was educated and trained by the Jesuits. In 1565 he became a canon at Salzburg, and soon afterward at Cologne, Treves, and W√ºrzburg as well; in the autumn of 1565, at the age of twelve, he likewise was elected bishop of Freising. Albert's wishes no doubt centered upon the neighboring archdiocese of Salzburg; but in 1569, when Elector Salentin VII of Isenburg-Grenzau incurred difficulties with the curia for non- recognition of the Council of Trent and was contemplating resignation, Ernest was proposed by his father, who had the support of the Spanish government at Brussels, as Salentin's successor. At the imperial Diet of Speyer (1570), the negotiations with Salentin were so far advanced that Ernest went to Cologne in November, and served his first residence there as canon till May 1571, such being the preliminary condition in the line of election. Salentin's resignation, however, was deferred, and in 1573 he actually submitted to the Council of Trent, and was thereupon confirmed by the curia as archbishop, foregoing the priestly consecration. That year instead saw Ernest elected, at the age of 19, as bishop of the small see of Hildesheim. In 1577, after the Bavarian court had failed in an attempt to secure M√ºnster for Ernest, efforts looking to Cologne were resumed and prosecuted more zealously than before. Moreover, the support of the curia now heightened the hope of some practical result. Duke Ernest, who for a time, in 1572, had well-nigh thwarted all his father's plans by a suddenly outcropping disinclination to save the spiritual vocation, was sent to Rome in the spring of 1574, for a sojourn of nearly two years, by way of reward for submitting to his father's will. At Rome he won the particular good-will of the pope, so that Gregory XIII resolved to support, with all his might, Ernest's installation as coadjutor to Salentin; in fact, the advancement of Bavarian family interests appeared to be the only possible way of recovering a more secure standing for the Roman Catholic Church in Lower Germany. The status which had been gained by the election of Ernest to Hildesheim could not as yet, by itself alone, afford a very trustworthy base of support. Destruction of the fortress above the village of Godesberg during the Cologne War 1583; the walls were breached by mines, and most of the defenders were put to death. Engraved by Franss Hogenberg, a Dutch engraver and artist of the 16th century But against the common plans of Salentin, the curial, and Bavarian court opposition manifested itself on the side of the chapter at Cologne; when, in 1577, Salentin resigned, Ernest was defeated at the new election by twelve votes to ten by Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, who was elected by the Protestants and the lukewarm Catholics of the chapter. Duke Albert, as well as the papal nuncio at Cologne, Bartolomeo Portia, protested against the election; but as both the emperor and the electors espoused Gebhard's cause, and as he passed for a good Catholic, receiving priestly consecration in March 1578, and swearing to the Council of Trent, the curia disregarded the Bavarian protest and in March 1580, confirmed the election. In 1581 Ernest was elected the Bishop of Li√®ge. When Archbishop Gebhard of Truchsess Waldburg converted to Protestantism in 1583, Ernest was elected Archbishop of Cologne on 22 May 1583. With Spanish and Bavarian troops he quickly drove Gebhard into Werl in the Cologne War ( or '). In 1584 he was elected the Bishop of M√ºnster, and also in that year the Papacy nuntiator was published. The Archbishopric of Cologne was important because it was one of the seven Imperial Electors of Holy Roman Emperor, and as three of them were already Protestant, if Cologne was ruled by a Protestant a Protestant Emperor could be elected. By now he was the Archbishop of Cologne and the Bishop of Li√®ge, M√ºnster, Freising and Hildesheim, and he was called the protector of Roman Catholicism in northwestern Germany. He was an ardent supporter of the Counter-Reformation, and assisted the Catholics in J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg and Baden. In 1595 he selected his nephew Ferdinand of Bavaria to be the coadjutor of the bishoprics and retired from most secular affairs. Ernest died in 1612 in Arnsberg, Westphalia, and was buried in Cologne Cathedral. He was succeeded by Ferdinand of Bavaria. ==Ancestry References  External links == * Ernest of Bavaria ‚Äì the Prince-Bishop of Liege in modern Europe, 400th anniversary * Tripota ‚Äì Trier portrait database * Ernest of Bavaria in the Portal of Rhenish History * * Portr√§t von Frans Hogenberg von 1604 () * Epitaph of Ernest of Bavaria Category:1554 births Category:1612 deaths Category:Nobility from Munich Category:House of Wittelsbach Category:Archbishop-Electors of Cologne Ernest 01 Category:16th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:17th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Burials at Cologne Cathedral Category:Prince-Bishops of Li√®ge Category:Prince-Bishops of M√ºnster Category:Roman Catholic Prince-Bishops of Freising Ernest 02 Category:German people of the Eighty Years' War Category:Abbots of Stavelot ","title":"Ernest of Bavaria"},{"id":"5566192","text":"The Blind Goddess is a lostThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: The Blind Goddess 1926 American silent mystery film directed by Victor Fleming.

The station is owned by Morris Multimedia. WXXV-TV's studios are located on US 49 in Lyman (with a Gulfport postal address), and its transmitter is located on Wire Road East, in unincorporated Stone County, northeast of McHenry. ==History== The station signed on February 14, 1987 as the market's third television outlet (after WLOX and WMAH-TV). It was originally owned by Gulf Coast Television Ltd. Airing an analog signal on UHF channel 25, WXXV was Mississippi's first Fox affiliate to launch before WDBD in Jackson and WNTZ-TV in Natchez (the latter two signed on before WXXV did). For the first four months of the network's existence, the network (which only aired late night programs at the time) was only available over-the-air in the extreme western and extreme eastern portions of the market via independent stations WNOL-TV (now an affiliate of The CW) or WPMI-TV (now an NBC affiliate); WXXV signed on two months prior to Fox's first night of primetime programming. Gulf Coast Television sold the station to AmSouth Realty, a subsidiary of AmSouth Bank in 1989. Prime Cities Broadcasters bought the station in 1991. WXXV aired the ABC crime drama NYPD Blue starting in 1994 when local ABC affiliate WLOX refused to air the show. From January 1995 until September 2006, the station also featured some limited UPN programming out-of- pattern through a secondary affiliation. Prime Cities Broadcasters sold the station to current owner Morris Multimedia in 1997. A new second digital subchannel was launched in September 2006 to be the area's MyNetworkTV affiliate. Now considered a programming service rather than a true over-the- air broadcast network, it is a sister operation to Fox. WXXV's broadcasts became digital-only on February 17, 2009.http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/article/20090207/NEWS01/902070322 The station continues to broadcast on digital channel 48.http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf However, through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display WXXV's virtual channel as 25. The station was added to DirecTV's local station offering on June 16, 2010. The station also served as the Hattiesburg‚ÄìLaurel market's longtime default Fox affiliate. WXXV's transmitter tower site and directional antenna pattern are strategically located and designed to enable the station to cover the entire southern half of Mississippi, including the Gulf Coast and Pine Belt regions. In addition, WXXV could be picked up locally on Comcast in the Pine Belt. On October 13, 2011, low-powered WHPM-LD joined the network as the first ever Fox outlet for Hattiesburg and Laurel. Despite the addition of that outlet to the network, Comcast in Hattiesburg and Laurel continues to offer WXXV's standard and high definition channels on its system. That market still lacks its own MyNetworkTV-affiliated station resulting in WXXV being the Pine Belt's default affiliate (through its main channel's secondary affiliation as of 2015). ==Subchannels== WXXV-DT2 WXXV-DT2 is the NBC- affiliated second digital subchannel of WXXV-TV, broadcasting on virtual and UHF channel 25.2. Over the air, WXXV-DT2 broadcasts a 720p high definition signal (downconverted from the native 1080i resolution of the NBC network); however, a direct-to-cable full 1080i high definition feed of this subchannel is available on select cable providers. WXXV-DT2 can also be seen on Sparklight channel 18 and in full high definition on digital channel 465. History WXXV-DT2 first signed on in September 2006 to be the market's MyNetworkTV affiliate. On June 25, 2012, it was announced WXXV would become the area's first-ever locally based NBC affiliate. The MyNetworkTV affiliation was moved to cable-exclusive status so that WXXV-DT2 could become the NBC outlet. Prior to the station adding NBC, both WDSU-TV in New Orleans (for Gulfport, Long Beach and Pass Christian) and WDAM-TV in Hattiesburg‚ÄìLaurel (for Biloxi, D'Iberville, Jackson County and Stone County) served as the Gulf Coast's longtime de facto affiliates on cable, with both affiliates having over-the-air coverage in some portions of the market. WXXV-DT3 WXXV-DT3 is the CW+-affiliated third digital subchannel of WXXV-TV, broadcasting on virtual and UHF channel 25.3. It can also be seen on Cable ONE digital channel 476. Presently, WXXV-DT3 airs in a 16:9 widescreen standard definition picture format, most likely due to WXXV's current multiplexer limitations prohibiting the station from airing all three of its subchannels in high definition. History What is now WXXV-DT3 began its life on September 21, 1998, as \\"WBGP\\" (standing for The WB GulfPort), a cable-only affiliate of The WB through the national WB 100+ service. Since it was only available on cable, the call sign was fictional in nature and thus not officially recognized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Before its sign-on, viewers in the area received The WB through Superstation WGN or the network's New Orleans affiliates (first WGNO, then later WNOL- TV).http://www.yourcwtv.com/partners/gulfcoast/schedule.php With the merge between UPN and The WB on September 18, 2006, the station became part of The CW through the new network's similar national service, The CW Plus. Throughout its cable-exclusive period, the station did not have an actual owner and had a signal provided to cable companies through a closed circuit satellite feed. \\"WBGP\\" was carried on Cable ONE channel 7 in Harrison County and channel 80 in Jackson County. Its previous CW logo referred to the channel 7 slot but it was not identified on-air with reference to it. On January 1, 2015, WXXV took over promotional and advertising responsibilities of \\"WBGP\\" from Cable ONE. As a result, the service was added to a new third subchannel of WXXV in order to offer over-the-air viewers access to The CW for the first time. The new subchannel did not retain the slots on Cable ONE's basic tier allotted to \\"WBGP\\"; instead, WXXV-DT3 replaced WXXV's cable-only MyNetworkTV channel on digital channel 476. MyNetworkTV programming concurrently moved to a secondary affiliation on WXXV's primary channel and can be seen on weeknights from 10 until midnight.http://www.sunherald.com/2014/12/24/5985870/wxxv-to-become- coasts-first-local.html ==Digital television== Digital channels The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - !

Syndicated programming on WXXV-DT2 includes Judge Judy, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and Family Feud among others. ==News operation== The station airs all national breaking news coverage from Fox News and the network's weekly public affairs show. Unlike most Fox affiliates, however, WXXV did not operate a local news department of its own for most of its existence but has done so in two previous attempts in the past. From 1991 to 1992, WDBD aired a local newscast called Mississippi News Tonight which was simulcasted on WXXV and produced by WLOX's then-owners Love Communications. Likewise, it featured regional news and weather coverage despite being produced at WDBD's studios in Jackson. Due to low ratings and inconsistent viewership, the program was dropped from both outlets after only a year on the air. For a few years in the late-1990s and early 2000s, WXXV operated its own locally based news operation from its Gulfport studios. A broadcast, known as Fox 25 News at Nine, attempted to provide another option for viewers in the market besides longtime dominant WLOX. For an unknown reason, however, this effort also eventually ceased production. On September 30, 2013, WXXV launched an in-house news operation for the second time in its history following the expansion of its studios to house the department; the station hired 15 personnel to staff the startup operation. Locally produced newscasts, running a half-hour in length, air on both the Fox and NBC channels in high definition under the News 25 branding. The main channel airs a weeknight prime time show at 9 p.m. while weeknight newscasts at 5:30 and 10 p.m. are seen on WXXV-DT2. NBC Nightly News is therefore aired on an alternate live feed at 6 p.m. which is unlike most NBC affiliates in the Central Time Zone. The NBC subchannel also carries local weather cut-ins on weekday mornings from 7 to 11 a.m. during the Today Show.Local News to Debut on WXXV Tonight TVSpy, September 30, 2013.WXXV NBC LineupWXXV Fox Lineup The station does not maintain a sports department.

Neighbouring communities Homberg borders in the north on the town of Stadtallendorf (Marburg- Biedenkopf), in the northeast on the town of Kirtorf, in the southeast on the community of Gem√ºnden, in the south on the community of M√ºcke, in the southwest on the town of Gr√ºnberg and the community of Rabenau (both in Gie√üen district), in the west on the community of Ebsdorfergrund, and in the northwest on the town of Am√∂neburg (both in Marburg-Biedenkopf). Constituent communities The town of Homberg consists of not only the namesake main town, but also of the outlying centres of Appenrod, Bleidenrod, B√º√üfeld, Dannenrod, Deckenbach, Erbenhausen, Gontershausen, Haarhausen, H√∂ingen, Maulbach, Nieder-Ofleiden, Ober-Ofleiden and Schadenbach. ==Politics== Town council The municipal elections held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results: * SPD 11 seats * CDU 10 seats * FWG (citizens' coalition) 5 seats * FDP 1 seats Coat of arms Castle Homberg's oldest known seal dates back to 1234, even before the town was granted town rights. Until the 16th century, the town's arms generally showed a castle or town wall with the red-and-silver-striped Lion of Hessen, and in 1536, a new version suddenly showed the lion \\"sinister\\" ‚Äì facing left (from the arms bearer's point of view). The arms in use today, which were adopted in the late 19th century, are based on this version.

From 1942 to 1946, he served in the United States Navy where he acted as a Japanese interpreter. He was appointed to the faculty at UCLA in 1947. In 1965, he was appointed Professor of Italian and Dean of College of Letters and Sciences on the Riverside campus. Subsequently, he became Vice Chancellor on the Riverside Campus. In 1973, he left California to become Chancellor and Commonwealth Professor of Italian at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where he remained until his retirement in 1978. Professor Golino contributed considerably to the field of Italian scholarship and particularly to contemporary Italian literature. One of his main goals was to make Italian culture more readily available to college students and the American public. His numerous lectures on and reviews of contemporary works being published in Italy and still unknown in the United States speak clearly to this. As a scholar, he was known among Italianists as an incisive promoter of the concept of the baroque. His visibility was due largely to his critical edition of Carlo de'Dottori's seventeenth century work, La prigione (1962), his Italian grammars with Charles Speroni, his translations and articles on contemporary Italian poetry, and his founding of the Italian Quarterly. In 1958 and again in 1963, Golino received awards from the Italian government for his contributions to Italian culture. ==References== Category:Italian literary critics Category:Italian male non- fiction writers Category:University of California, Riverside faculty Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:1913 births Category:1991 deaths Category:University of Massachusetts Boston faculty ","title":"Carlo L.

It is based on the 1931 novel by Upton Sinclair. It shows how two families are devastated by the effects of alcohol and Prohibition. In addition to the main story, many small vignettes illustrate the theme, from the hotel resident who breakfasts on beer to the New York cabbies who all carry guns to protect themselves from bootleggers. When the picture was released in March 1932, Prohibition had been law for almost 13 years and would not end until December 5, 1933, with the passage of the 21st Amendment. ==Plot== 1916, we meet the Chilcotes of Louisiana. In their elite circles, no one is surprised that the men are all drunk after an elegant dinner. Maggie May looks after her father, tying his shoes for him and retrieving him when he makes a spectacle of himself in public. ‚ÄúI'm just a low down cowardly drunkard,‚Äù he tells her. Chilcote goes on a drinking and gambling spree and loses most of the family's money. In the agonies of withdrawal, he kills himself. After the funeral, his friends toast him; Maggie smashes the whiskey decanter, raging: ‚ÄúI hope I live to see the day that every bit that was ever made was poured into the cesspool where it belongs.‚Äù Maggie's brother, Roger Jr., a writer, moves to New York City when his novel is accepted. His college friend, newspaper reporter Jerry Tyler, gets him a room in the modest hotel where he lives. Like Chilcote, Pow Tarleton wasted the family resources; now his wife, Bertha and their son, Kip, manage this place. Pow stumps for Woodrow Wilson's re-election campaign, for the free drinks as well as the politics. Wilson is re-elected; people chant ‚ÄúFour years more, we stay out of the War.‚Äù Cut to American troops marching, sailing, fighting. Jerry enlists. In the trenches, the men around him wonder if they'll even get a beer when they get home. The war ends, and in 1919, the 18th amendment becomes law, despite President Wilson's veto. Maggie May comes to the hotel to meet her brother, and a flirtatious Pow shows her to Roger's room, assuming she is a prostitute. Kip runs upstairs to throw her out and is shattered when he learns the truth. Roger staggers in, with Jerry. They have been celebrating Jerry's return. When Roger pours a toast, they discover that Pow has replaced all of Roger's liquor with water. Maggie May realizes that she and Kip have been fighting the same battle, and they warm to each other. She and Roger go to relatives on Long Island, supposedly far from temptation. June 29, 1919. People stock up on liquor and try to drink their fill before midnight. Cut to a lavish party thrown by the Chilcote's cousins, whose bar is stocked by a boat from Bermuda. Roger is smitten with actress Eileen Pinchon. Kip and Maggie dance, but Kip leaves after the snobbish cousins high-hat him. Bertha tries to take a bottle of bad liquor away from Pow. When it breaks, he beats her to death while she screams that it is Prohibition now.. Maggie comforts the devastated Kip. Pow is sentenced to life imprisonment.. Kip does not renew the lease on the hotel, leaving some guests wondering how to move the liquor stored in their rooms. Maggie May comforts Kip. ‚ÄúBootleg booze, that's what killed my Mom,‚Äù he sobs. He is stunned when she confesses her love for him. They marry, and Kip joins the U.S. Treasury Department. His boss, the Major, doesn't believe in Prohibition but will enforce it, with only a fraction of the resources needed. He gives Kip a partner, Abe Schilling, a quirky, experienced agent. In a bar, they watch teenagers getting drunk. Their cover is blown, and they are beaten and thrown out. A crook warns Kip that bootleggers are forming an association. Maggie tells Kip she is pregnant. The gangsters do organize, all over the country, with systems of bribery and terror‚Äîand the financial backing of ‚Äúhonest‚Äù businessmen. Cut to Eileen Pinchon's speakeasy‚Äîa glamorous nightclub patronized by celebrities. Abe announces a raid, and the cops smash everything. Roger, a big investor in his mistress's club, is shaken. The bellboy promises some ‚Äúreal prewar kentucky bourbon.‚Äù Cut to a sequence showing the process of creating innumerable counterfeits‚Äîusing denatured alcohol. Roger wakes up sick and blind, and Eileen runs away. The ophthalmologist says that they have had hundreds of cases like this since Prohibition. Some bootleggers don't remove the methyl put in the alcohol to make it undrinkable. There is no hope. Roger moves in with Kip and Maggie and learns Braille. Kip promises justice for Roger. The Major signs the warrant but says it is futile, expounding on the failures of Prohibition. Maggie goes into labor, and Kip is kidnapped from the hospital by gangsters who plan to make his horrible death a warning. Abe saves him but is shot; he dies in Kip's arms, telling him to quit the department. It isn't any use, and taking care of his family comes first. At the hospital, Kip looks at his tiny son, ‚Äúborn into an awful mess...Before they pull him into it, I guess they'll have it all figured out.‚Äù ==Cast== * Walter Huston as Pow Tarleton * Wallace Ford as Jerry Tyler * Dorothy Jordan as Maggie May Chilcote * Robert Young as Kip Tarleton * Lewis Stone as Roger Chilcote * Neil Hamilton as Roger Chilcote, Jr. * Jimmy Durante as Abe Schilling * Myrna Loy as Eileen Pinchon ==Production == The AFI catalog states that MGM paid $18,000 ($287,000 in 2020) for the rights to Upton Sinclair's novel. TCM says that the price was $20,000 ($319,000 in 2020). In the book, Kip is killed, and Maggie May, already a speaker against \\"Demon Rum\\", issues a call to arms to the women of America to rally for enforcement, financial support and community action. The book ends with her slogan: Prohibition hasn't failed! Prohibition hasn't been tried! Try it! Near the end of the picture, the Major sums up the failure of Prohibition: > \\"The whole business grows more like a farce each day. It costs the > government $50 million a year to enforce the law, and where are we? There's > more alcohol being made in this country than ever before. 36,000 places in > this town where men and women and 17-year-old kids get drunk. More > speakeasies than there were saloons and what's more, the otherwise law- > abiding citizen won‚Äôt put down a bottle until it's empty. Simply because > we're trying to force a law down their throat they don‚Äôt want.‚Äù Kip says > things were pretty bad before and the Major replies, ‚ÄúThey got good liquor > then and they didn‚Äôt have to dodge machine gun bullets when they went > walking on Sundays.\\" ==Reception== On April 22, New York Times critic Mordaunt Hall criticized the film for being too long but praised all the major performances. Speaking to an audience still firmly immersed in Prohibition, he wrote: > \\"Possibly one of the best episodes is that revealing the making of > intoxicating drinks in this city. There is the printing of labels of all > sorts, the pouring of denatured alcohol into barrels, the filling of > bottles, the corking machine, sticking labels on bottles, clamping the > tinfoil over the corks, the stamping of \\"Canada\\" on gunnysacks, wetting the > sacks, passing them through salt; and then, after they are filled with a > dozen bottles, they are sewn up and ready for the unfortunate consumer. > Certainly this is enough to make many fight shy of bootlegged whisky.\\" Leonard Maltin gives the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"Strange but interesting.\\" Introducing the film in February 2020, film critic and TCM host Eddie Muller called it \\"an unusual mix of historical documentary, family melodrama and crime movie.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1932 films Category:1932 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Victor Fleming Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films based on works by Upton Sinclair ","title":"The Wet Parade"},{"id":"5566358","text":"Drowaton is the third studio album by the indie pop band Starlight Mints. ==Track listing== All tracks by Starlight Mints # \\"Pumpkin\\" ‚Äì 2:40 # \\"Torts\\" ‚Äì 2:03 # \\"Inside of Me\\" ‚Äì 3:43 # \\"Pearls (Submarine #2)\\" ‚Äì 2:14 # \\"Seventeen Devils\\" ‚Äì 3:49 # \\"Rhino Stomp\\" ‚Äì 3:24 # \\"The Killer\\" ‚Äì 3:02 # \\"Eyes of the Night\\" ‚Äì 2:51 # \\"Drowaton\\" ‚Äì 5:01 # \\"The Bee\\" ‚Äì 3:27 # \\"Rosemarie\\" ‚Äì 3:29 # \\"Sidewalk\\" ‚Äì 4:24 ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Starlight Mints albums ","title":"Drowaton"},{"id":"5566371","text":"The White Sister is a 1933 American pre-Code romantic drama film directed by Victor Fleming and starring Helen Hayes and Clark Gable. It was based on the 1909 novel of the same name by Francis Marion Crawford and was a remake of the silent film The White Sister (1923). ==Plot== The banns are called for the third time for the marriage of Italian Princess Angela Chiaromonte (Helen Hayes) and the husband chosen by her father (Lewis Stone), Ernesto Traversi. Driving home through streets filled with revelers celebrating a saint's feast day, their limousine is rear-ended by a car full of officers, driven by Giovanni Severi (Clark Gable), a handsome army lieutenant. Traversi, the son of a banker, is 31, rather stuffy, preoccupied with business. Angela is a warm-hearted, impulsive, romantic, innocent young woman, who dreams every night of a handsome man she has never met. Angela persuades her duenna, Mina, to go outside to the Carnival, where they admire the antics of a pantomime horse. The horse approaches Angela, and she asks its name. ‚ÄúGiovanni‚Äù it replies, in the voice of the handsome lieutenant, and the horse‚Äîor rather the front half‚Äîfollows Angela through the crowd while Mina is swept away by the revelers. Giovanni seats Angela in a quiet restaurant where they have tea and talk for hours. He tells her he loves her and sees her home, filling her arms with flowers. Giovanni and his Colonel come to a ball given by Prince Chiaromonte. In the garden, Giovanni and Angela kiss for the first time; her father interrupts them. Giovanni declares that he wants to marry her and is forced to leave. Angela tells her father that the kiss revealed to her how much she loves Giovanni; now she knows, she cannot marry a man she does not love. Angela runs away to Giovanni. Her father pursues her and, in a freak accident, their cars collide and her father is killed. Angela disappears, but Father Saracinesca gives Giovanni her address. He comes to her but, wracked by grief and guilt, she sends him away. Italy joins the War, and Giovanni comes to say goodbye. She gives him the cross she wears around her neck, for luck. He gives her an ivory whistle. Giovanni is shot down and officially declared dead. In fact, he has been taken in by a German woman who is half Italian. Angela tells Father Saracinesca that she will never marry anyone, and that she believes God wants her to serve him as a nun. At the convent, Angela receives her postulant's habit and learns that she will be trained as a nurse. Her first lesson is never to use the word ‚Äúmine.‚Äù Meanwhile, Giovanni leaves his refuge. When he is finally captured, he gives a false name. In the prison camp, there is no way to get word out. Two years later, Giovanni emerges from a long session in solitary confinement to find an epidemic of cholera in the camp. He takes the place of a corpse, steals a plane and flies off into the night. Angela takes her final vows as a bride of Christ. Home again and finding no trace of Angela, Giovanni goes looking for Father Saracinesca at the hospital. The nun who comes out to help him is Angela. She swoons and he catches her in his arms; they almost kiss, but she flees into the convent in horror. She prays for strength and eventually comes out to him. Their conversation is agonizing: She can't speak and says goodbye. Later Angela is sent out to a villa to help a patient, who turns out to be Giovanni. He implores her to give up the order, but she refuses. He tells her she can petition the Cardinal but she holds by her vows. He embraces her, but an air- raid breaks a window and shrouds the room in darkness. He finds Angela kneeling in prayer, repeating her vow. He takes her back to the convent. She says she will remember him and pray for him always. Later, at the hospital, Father Saracinesca brings her to Giovanni's bedside. His plane crashed. He tells her ‚ÄúI'll be waiting,‚Äù and dies, holding the little cross she gave him when he went off to war. ==Cast== * Helen Hayes as Angela Chiaromonte * Clark Gable as Giovanni Severi * Lewis Stone as Prince Guido Chiaromonte * Louise Closser Hale as Mina Bernardo * May Robson as Mother Superior * Edward Arnold as Father Saracinesca * Alan Edwards as Ernesto Traversi ==Production== Sierra Nevada mountain range. Principal photography on The White Sister began in December 1932 with two units assigned to the production. Director Fleming completed all of the interiors and backlot sequences at the Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer studios at Culver City, California. Second unit director Cullen Tate was in charge of all the aerial sequences filmed in Reno, Nevada. Aerial coordinator Paul Mantz gathered all the aircraft required: Stearman C3, Curtiss Fledgling and Travel Air J-5 biplanes, leased from the Los Angeles area. All the aircraft were repainted to stand in as Italian and German fighters.Orriss 2013, p. 75. ==Reception== The White Sister generally received favorable reviews, with Variety saying, \\"Helen Hayes is the sorrowing Angela, as solid and satisfying a bit of acting as comes to the screen in a blue moon. Clark Gable is a gallant soldier hero and leaves nothing to be desired.\\"\\"Review: 'The White Sister.\\" Variety, December 31, 1932. Reviewer Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times reflected, \\"It is a beautiful production, but its scenes never seem as real as those of the old mute work.\\" ==Box office== According to MGM records, the film earned $750,000 in the United States and Canada and $922,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $456,000. ==References== Notes Citations Bibliography * Orriss, Bruce W.

It is based on the Xbox 360 video game of the same name by Xbox Game Studios and Rare, which was released alongside the TV series. Lloyd Goldfine and Paul Griffin served as executive producers, with Mike deSeve acting as story editor and Anne Bernstein and David Steven Cohen among the series' writers. Viva Pi√±ata premiered on August 26, 2006 as part of the 4Kids TV programming block, later moving to The CW4Kids before being removed from the schedule on October 25, 2008. In Canada, the series aired on YTV, where its final episode was broadcast on May 18, 2009, and would continue to air in reruns until June 24, 2011. The series also aired on Nicktoons Network and CITV in the UK and on Nickelodeon and ABC Television in Australia. ==Synopsis== On Pi√±ata Island, pi√±atas of various roam the gardens freely, eating candy and coexisting with one another in a peaceful society. When a pi√±ata's candy inside reaches a high enough level, they are sent to a party via the Pi√±ata Central Canno√±ata, where they will be broken open by the partygoers before being repaired and returned to the island. The series follows a group of close pi√±ata friends and their day-to-day lives on the island. ==Characters== Main characters * Hudson Horstachio: (voiced by Dan Green) A horse pi√±ata with a green teal body like a pistachio, Hudson is one of the most popular pi√±atas in the business. As a celebrity he sometimes has to disguise himself when in public. His friends often have to keep his ego in check. He enjoys dancing and making extravagant statements about himself. * Paulie Pretztail: (voiced by Brian Maillard) A cross between a pretzel and a red-tailed fox, Paulie is a no-nonsense kind of pinata who could easily be considered to be \\"the clever-cloggs\\" of the main cast (besides Les). He is Fergy's best friend and shares his aversion towards being sent to parties (though it seems more of an annoyance to him, rather than Fergy's idea of thinking of going to a party as frightening). He seems to be good at cooking as shown in the episode ' Recipe for Disaster'. * Fergy Fudgehog: (voiced by David Wills) A cross between fudge and a hedgehog, Fergy loves candy, but fears parties. He is Paulie's best friend, and is frequently sought out by Langston to attend parties but always manages to escape his bugcatcher's net. His catchphrase is \\"Oh, fudge!\\" * Franklin Fizzlybear: (voiced by Marc Thompson) A brown grizzly bear with purple and yellow stripes. He enjoys surfing, and typically speaks with a surfer accent and related expressions. He is fairly laid back and occasionally has moments of intellectualism. He is not good at lying. He also draws portraits of the other pinatas. In the video game, his surfboard is an item that the player can purchase. * Tina & Teddington Twingersnap: (voiced by Kathleen Delaney and Jamie McGonnigal) A two-headed serpent crossed with gingersnap. They share a body, but argue a lot. They have both been shown to have sub-par gardening skills. Despite the fact that they appear to hate each other (after all, they are Brother and Sister), in one episode when they are accidentally separated, they end up greatly missing their other half. Teddington is the worst singer on Pinata Island and for some reason has a refined British accent. * Ella Elephanilla: (voiced by Rebecca Soler) A cross between an elephant and vanilla, Ella suffers from short-term memory loss, thus contradicting the saying that an elephant never forgets. She enjoys ballet. Because of her elegant moves, this caused Paulie and Fergy to both get huge, temporary crushes on her. They even asked her to a dance, but she forgot they had both asked her. No evidence has been shown that both Fergy and Paulie still have a crush on her, if they do, they are very subtle about it. * Les Galagoogoo: (voiced by Eric Stuart) A cross between a Galago and GooGoo, Les is smart and dextrous, however, when he speaks, it comes out as high-pitched gibberish. Les ranked second place in the 4Kids Viva Pi√±ata character poll. It appears that the main cast may be able to understand him, but simply ignore him. In one episode, he was able to speak, but he was ignored as he always had been. * Langston Lickatoad: (voiced by Mike Pollock) A cross between a licorice and a toad, Langston operates the Canno√±ata. He regularly tries to catch the stealthy duo Fergy and Paulie in order to send them to parties. * Professor Pester: (voiced by David Brimmer) The main villain of the series. In all the episodes he appears in, he and his Ruffians try to capture and destroy a pi√±ata, (usually Hudson) if not all of them, to obtain their candy. Note that he does not appear to be a pi√±ata. When he had his personality reversed and happily gobbled up all of Fergy's candy, he was scanned on the way to the Canno√±ata and found to have no candy. Nor do any of his ruffians appear to be pi√±atas; an episode shows that they resided on the island before the arrival of Pester and were partially responsible for the failure of his Sours experiment. His catchphrase is \\"I have no regrets\\", and he always says it when his plans backfire and he ends up losing. He and the Ruffians are the only non-pinatas from the games to have made it to the show, though to be noted Leafos makes a split second cameo in the theme song right when the announcer states \\"Welcome to Pinata Island\\" as the screen is panning over a field. Recurring characters * Beverly Badgesicle: Hudson's biggest, very obsessive fan. * Cecil Cocoadile: Cecil is the only pi√±ata on the island who thinks Chortles' jokes are funny, causing him to burst into tears laughing. In the pi√±ata world, cocoadile tears make excellent fertilizer, so while laughing and crying at his bad jokes, he is also helping Chortles with his garden. * Chortles Chippopotamus: (voiced by Sean Schemmel) Chortles has a horrible sense of humor, but fantastic gardening skills. Only Cecil Cocoadile thinks his jokes are funny, and Chortles uses Cecil's tears to help his garden grow. * Dr. Quincy Quackberry: A doctor and psychiatrist with a Groucho Marx-like personality. He wears glasses and a tie, and he customarily tells poor jokes. * The Great Bonboon (or just \\"The Bonboon\\"): A creature who pretends to be an all-knowing guru to steal candy from gullible pi√±atas like Professor Pester. He is usually meditating, but when no one is present, he talks to his friend Sid on the phone in his normal voice. Paulie is the only pinata who sees through his ruse. * King Roario: (voiced by Dan Green) The King of Pinata Island. * Mabel Moozipan: She owns a well-kept vegetable garden and despises trespassers. She is friends with Florence Fizzlybear. * Pecky Pudgeon: (voiced by Eric Stuart) Pecky takes photos for the local newspaper of Pi√±ata Island, the Pinata Yada Yada. He loves gossiping about everyone and will go to great lengths to bring in a juicy scoop for the paper. (He makes a cameo in the game taking a photo of Gretchen when she first appears) * Pierre Parrybo: (voiced by Pete Zarustica) Pierre organizes various activities on Pi√±ata Island. He's also the DJ for a call-in radio show. * Ruffians: Professor Pester's bumbling henchmen who usually ruin his plans, since they don't comprehend orders well. They waddle from side to side in their walk, and they love to prank one another. According to Pester, three are boys and one is a girl. * Petunia Pretztail: (voiced by Sieko Shih) A kung-fu warrior who is friends with Florence Fizzlybear, Francine Fudgehog, and especially Haily Hostachio, and teaches Fergy and Paulie how to find their own \\"fu\\". * Prewitt Profitamole: (voiced by Mike MacRae) A brilliant animal who seems to be the only mechanic on the island and he is a wonder at inventing. He also has a love for soaps, and watches them avidly. * Shirley Shellybean: Shirly is optimistic and always is ready to start a new adventure. * Simone Cinnamonkey: (voiced by Rebecca Soler) Hudson's brisk and resourceful agent. He speaks very quickly, rapidly counting off Hudson's schedule. Sometimes, he seems to want his pay more than Hudson's fame, but he is occasionally shown to care for him in both stern and encouraging ways. ==EpisodesHome media== Two episodes, \\"Chewnicorn in the Garden\\" and \\"Horstachio of a Different Color\\", were released for free download on the Xbox Live Marketplace as sneak peeks prior to the show's release. \\"Horstachio of a Different Color\\" was also featured on a bonus disc included with the Special Edition version of the Viva Pi√±ata game. Shout! Factory released two DVD volumes for Viva Pi√±ata. The first, The Pi√±atas Must Be Crazy And Other Stories., was released in February 2009 and contains episodes 1-5. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website (archive) * * Category:Viva Pi√±ata Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Category:2000s American animated television series Category:2006 American television series debuts Category:2009 American television series endings Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:2006 Canadian television series debuts Category:2009 Canadian television series endings Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:American computer-animated television series Category:Animated television series about horses Category:Animated series based on video games Category:Works based on Microsoft video games Category:Canadian animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:Canadian children's animated fantasy television series Category:Canadian computer-animated television series Category:CW4Kids original programming Category:YTV (TV channel) original programming ","title":"Viva Pi√±ata (TV series)"},{"id":"5566394","text":"Nail‚Äìpatella syndrome is a genetic disorder that results in small, poorly developed nails and kneecaps, but can also affect many other areas of the body, such as the elbows, chest, and hips. The name \\"nail‚Äìpatella\\" can be very misleading because the syndrome often affects many other areas of the body, including even the production of certain proteins.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . Those affected by NPS may have one or more affected areas of the body, and its severity varies depending on the individual. It is also referred to as iliac horn syndrome, hereditary onychoosteodysplasia (HOOD syndrome), Fong disease or Turner‚ÄìKieser syndrome.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 786-7. . Diagnosis of NPS can be made at birth, but is common for it to remain undiagnosed for several generations. While there is no cure available for NPS, treatment is available and recommended. ==Signs and symptoms== The skeletal structures of individuals who have this disorder may have pronounced deformities. As reported by several medical doctors, the following features are commonly found in people who suffer from nail‚Äìpatella syndrome:Choczaj-Kukula, A., & Janniger, C. K. (2009). Nail‚Äìpatella syndrome. In emedicine: WebMD. Retrieved October 11, 2009, from WebMD database. Bones and joints AP radiograph showing a hypoplastic patella in NPS AP radiograph of the right iliac crest showing a bony exostosis or posterior iliac horn, which is pathognomonic of NPS * Patellar involvement is present in approximately 90% of patients; however, patellar aplasia occurs in only 20%. * In instances in which the patellae are smaller or luxated, the knees may be unstable. * The elbows may have limited motion (e.g., limited pronation, supination, extension). * Subluxation of the radial head may occur. * Arthrodysplasia of the elbows is reported in approximately 90% of patients. * General hyperextension of the joints can be present. * Exostoses arising from the posterior aspect of the iliac bones (\\"iliac horns\\") are present in as many as 80% of patients; this finding is considered pathognomonic for the syndrome. * Other reported bone changes include scoliosis, scapular hypoplasia, and the presence of cervical ribs. File:Nail-patella syndrome (NPS) Elbow1.JPGAn elbow of a man who suffers from nail‚Äìpatella syndrome (NPS) File:Nail-patella Elbow2.JPGThis is a view from a different angle of the same man's other elbow Kidney issues may arise such as deposition of protein in the urine and nephritis. Proteinuria is usually the first sign of kidney involvement and either rapidly or years after suffering from asymptomatic deposition of protein in the urine, kidney failure occurs in around 5% of NPS patients. Hypothyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and thin tooth enamel are associated with NPS, but whether these are related or simply coincidences are unclear. ==Genetics== Nail‚Äìpatella syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The Nail‚Äìpatella syndrome is inherited via autosomal dominancy linked to aberrancy on human chromosome 9's q arm (the longer arm), 9q34. This autosomal dominancy means that only a single copy, instead of both, is sufficient for the disorder to be expressed in the offspring, meaning the chance of getting the disorder from an affected heterozygous parent is 50%. The frequency of the occurrence is 1/50,000. The disorder is linked to the ABO blood group locus. It is associated with random mutations in the LMX1B gene. Studies have been conducted and 83 mutations of this gene have been identified. ==Diagnosis== The hallmark features of this syndrome are poorly developed fingernails, toenails, and patellae (kneecaps). Sometimes, this disease causes the affected person to have either no thumbnails or a small piece of a thumbnail on the edge of the thumb. The lack of development, or complete absence of fingernails results from the loss of function mutations in the LMX1B gene. This mutation may cause a reduction in dorsalising signals, which then results in the failure to normally develop dorsal specific structures such as nails and patellae. Other common abnormalities include elbow deformities, abnormally shaped pelvic (hip) bones, and kidney disease. ==Treatment== Treatment for NPS varies depending on the symptoms observed. * Perform screening for kidney disease and glaucoma, surgery, intensive physiotherapy, or genetic counseling. * ACE inhibitors are taken to treat proteinuria and hypertension in NPS patients. * Dialysis and kidney transplant. * Physical therapy, bracing and analgesics for joint pain. * Other surgery treatments such as patella realignment, joint replacement, and the cutting away of the head of radius. == See also == * List of cutaneous conditions * List of radiographic findings associated with cutaneous conditions == References  External links == * GeneReview/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on nail‚Äìpatella syndrome Category:Syndromes affecting the kidneys Category:Rare diseases Category:Conditions of the skin appendages Category:Autosomal dominant disorders Category:Transcription factor deficiencies Category:Patella Category:Syndromes affecting bones ","title":"Nail‚Äìpatella syndrome"},{"id":"5566408","text":"Fran Flory is head coach of the LSU Tigers women's indoor volleyball team and former head coach of the LSU Tigers women's beach volleyball team. ==Coaching career== Flory is the former women's volleyball head coach at the University of Kentucky, Southeastern Louisiana University and Wittenberg University. She is first in all-time SEC wins and all-time wins at LSU, ahead of her predecessor, Scott Luster, who won 308 games in 13 years. Her LSU teams have captured seven consecutive SEC Western Division championships (2005‚Äì2011) as well as the 2009 SEC championship. Flory began her coaching career as head coach at Wittenberg University, where she coached for one season (posting a record of 11‚Äì21) in 1986. In 1987, she became an assistant coach at Texas A&M.; After one season at Texas A&M;, Flory, a Baton Rouge, Louisiana native moved to LSU as an assistant for four years under head coach Scott Luster. She served as a graduate assistant coach in 1988, before being named a full-time assistant in 1989. During her four seasons as a member of the Lady Tigers (now Tigers) coaching staff, Flory helped LSU to unprecedented success with three SEC championships, three SEC Tournament championships and two NCAA Final Four appearances. In 1992, Flory left LSU to assume the head coaching position at Southeastern Louisiana University. In her one season at Southeastern Louisiana, she led the Lady Lions to a 21‚Äì13 record.

It was founded in 1554 when King Gustav Vasa divided the diocese of Turku, extending over the whole country, into two parts. At first, the new Diocese was established in Viipuri, the first bishop being Paavali Juusteen. After the Russian occupation of Viipuri in 1723 the bishop's seat was moved to Porvoo instead. But with the foundation of a new Swedish Diocese in Porvoo in 1923 the second oldest Diocese of Finland had to move to Tampere and since then the Diocese have been named the Diocese of Tampere. The Tampere Cathedral opens everyday but places some limitations on the number of hours it is opened. At the upper part of the cathedral, there is 'The Wounded Angel.'

It is designed by Pok√©mon USA and based on Satoshi Tajiri's Pok√©mon media franchise. It was released in Australia in August 2006, followed by releases in Europe and Southeast Asia later that year and in the United States and Japan in 2007. On June 2, 2009, the Pok√©mon Trading Figure Game was confirmed to be discontinued. Pok√©mon Duel, a free-to-play digital version of the Pok√©mon Trading Figure Game, was released for Android and iOS devices in April 2016. ==Development== The Pok√©mon Trading Figure Game was designed by Tsunekaz Ishihara, a general producer for Pok√©mon and one of the designers of the trading card game, with Kouichi Ooyama and Mr. Masayuki Miura. They spent several years preparing the game's look and feel to ensure the best possible trading figure game. They aimed at maintaining the spirit of the Pok√©mon through all the properties, but realized there would be some differences. The figures are designed and created by Kaiyodo, with help from the game designers. ==Gameplay== Players take turns moving their Pok√©mon around the playmat, attempting to get one of their Pok√©mon on the opponent's Goal. If their Pok√©mon stops next to an opposing Pok√©mon, they can choose to battle. In a battle, both players spin their own figures, and the best result wins. A single game can take place on the 3-on-3 playmat or the 6-on-6 playmat. The quick 3-on-3 version lets players explore the basic strategies of the game while the 6-on-6 playmat offers a wider variety of tactics. A player can spin a trainer figure, to use a boost card. ==Next Quest set (International Release)== The \\"Next Quest\\" set is made up of 42 figures and 8 cards. These pieces are divided into four levels of rarity: white star (extremely rare), black star (rare), black diamond (uncommon) and black circle (common). There are also 2 subsets: the pearl sub-set, which contains all the rare figures and are a pearly colour, and the crystal subset are see through and contains all the EXrare figures. A ref figure is also found in the 9 figure set it would appear it is not part of the nextquest set however as it has the promo symbol underneath. Two starter sets are available for this collection, entitled \\"Flamethrower\\" and \\"Riptide\\". Each starter set contains four figures, as well as the following: *Double-sided play mat (for 3 vs 3 or 6 vs 6 figurine play). *3 trainer cards (Max Revive, X Attack, X Accuracy, or Switch). *A full-color poster of the 42 figurines in the Next Quest set, with checklist boxes for collectors. *A rule book.

Packaging The US release offers two types of starter sets and three types of booster packs. All retail packagings are made of printed cardboard and plastic clamshell. The 1-figure booster pack has one visible figure-spot. The 2-figure booster pack has one visible figure-spot, and one secret figure spot. The 3-figure booster pack has two visible figure-spots, and one secret figure-spot. The visible figure-spot in the 1-figure booster pack contains either Groudon, Kyogre, Pikachu, Absol, Torchic, or Mudkip.

Scyther was later released as a visible figure in the Target- exclusive 3-figure booster pack. The second visible figure-spot in the 3-figure booster pack originally contained the Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl starters. A Target-exclusive release of the 3-figure booster pack has the starters replaced by crystal variations of the other visible figures. The secret figure-spots in the 2-figure and 3-figure booster packs contain one random non-promotional figure from the Next Quest set. Red and Brendan trainer figures from the starter sets appear rarely in the secret figure-spot of the 3-figure booster packs. Figure Distribution The figures from the US release do not have figure rarity and rarity symbol. Packaging Contents The secret figure-spots from the US release booster packs always have one trainer card. All figures from the US release are sold with the spinner base, and the color of the spinner base in the secret figure-spot matches the color of the base in the visible figure-spot of the same pack. Figure Construction Beedrill figure from the US release has an additional support rod connecting between the Beedrill figure and the figure base. ==Groundbreakers set== \\"Groundbreakers\\" would have been the first expansion set for the Pok√©mon Trading Figure Game. The expansion was to feature two starter sets, with one, \\"Skydive,\\" seeing an early release in Wal-Mart stores in November 2008. The other, \\"Whirlwind,\\" also saw a retail release. The full release of the set was delayed several times before the Pok√©mon Trading Figure Game was officially discontinued on June 2, 2009, leaving the set unreleased. ==References== Trading Figure Game ","title":"Pok√©mon Trading Figure Game"},{"id":"5566477","text":"Norma Jean Wright (born July 15) is an American singer and was the lead vocalist of the American group Chic, a soul, R&B; and disco band, from 1977 to 1978.Hogan, Ed \\"Norma Jean Wright Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2011-08-08 ==Early life== Norma Jean Wright was born in Ripley, Tennessee.

It is said to have carried the first letter to the Pony Express on April 3, 1860, from a train pulled behind the locomotive Missouri. The line connected the second and third largest cities in the state of Missouri prior to the American Civil War. The stage route that it paralleled had previously been called the \\"Hound Dog Trail\\". ==History==  Construction in 1850s  Construction on the railroad (formed during an 1846 meeting at the Hannibal office of John Marshall Clemens, father of Mark Twain) began in 1851 from both cities. Bonds from counties along the route along with the donation of 600,000 acres (2,400 km¬≤) in land voted by Congress paid for construction. The lines met in Chillicothe, Missouri, on February 13, 1859. A marker the railroad placed at the site was discovered in 2009 at the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad Museum in Galesburg, Illinois. The line started westward from Hannibal and ran through the Missouri cities of Palmyra, Monroe City, Lakenen, Shelbina, Clarence, Anabel, Macon, Bevier, Callao, New Cambria, Bucklin, Brookfield, Laclede, Meadville, Wheeling, Chillicothe, Utica, Mooresville, Breckenridge, Nettleton, Hamilton, Kidder, Cameron, Osborn, Stewartsville, Hemple, Easton, before arriving in St. Joseph. Early locomotive, Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad John Rogers, well before he became a popular 19th-century American sculptor, worked in 1856 and 1857 as a mechanic on the railroad. Wallace, David H. \\"The Art of John Rogers: 'So Real and So True'\\", article in American Art Journal, Vol. 4, No. 2, Nineteenth-Century American Sculpture (Nov., 1972), pp. 59-70, online first page accessed via JSTOR Web site on January 21, 2007 Abraham Lincoln rode the route in 1859 en route to a speech in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The first assignment of Col. Ulysses S. Grant during the American Civil War was protecting the railroad and Pony Express mail. Grant was promoted to brigadier general in August 1861 after the assignment. Shortly after Grant left his assignment, the railroad experienced its worst disaster of the war on September 3, 1861, when bushwhackers burned a bridge over the Platte River, causing a derailment that killed between 17 and 20 and injured 100 in the Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy.  Post offices on wheels, 1860s  The first experiment in distributing mails in so-called \\"post offices on wheels\\" was made in 1862 by William A. Davis between Hannibal and St. Joseph, Missouri. It was intended to expedite the connection at St. Joseph with the overland stage, which had replaced the Pony Express routes to the West a year earlier. The H&StJ; furnished a baggage car, altered to Davis' specifications. Similar to a postal route agent's car, it had a table and a 65-pigeon-hole letter case, but no pouch rack. Davis boarded the westbound train at Palmyra, Missouri, with authority to open the sacks and letter packages which were addressed to the St. Joseph DPO, to remove all California letters, and to make up and sort the mail in a manner identical to the way the St. Joseph DPO would have dispatched it. Davis was paid at the rate of $100.00 per month. The railroad was harassed by guerrillas and by lack of maintenance, resulting in several suspensions and finally abandonment of the experiment. After the Civil War, Railway Post Office (RPO) service was re-established on this line, and it became known as the Chicago & Kansas City RPO. Hannibal Bridge over Missouri River at Kansas City. In 1867 a consortium of Charles E. Kearney, Robert T. Van Horn, and Kersey Coates persuaded the railroad to build a cutoff at Cameron to Kansas City, Missouri. The railroad, through its subsidiary Kansas City and Cameron Railroad, built a shortcut and the ( Hannibal Bridge over the Missouri River in downtown Kansas City. The bridge established a direct link between Chicago and Texas. It was the first rail bridge across the Missouri River when it opened July 3, 1869, and established Kansas City rather than Leavenworth or St. Joseph as the dominant city in the region.  Acquisition by Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad  The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad used the railroad for through traffic to Chicago almost from the start, and in 1883 acquired it. The rail connection between Hannibal and St. Joseph remained in place for about 125 years. On March 2, 1970, the railroad became the property of Burlington Northern after the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad merged with 3 other railroads to form the new company. During the mid-1980s, the railroad discontinued service from Brookfield westward to St. Joseph. Today, four miles (6 km) of track between Brookfield and Laclede remain, and is primarily used for surplus rail car storage on the (now) BNSF Railway. The tracks from Laclede westward to just outside St. Joseph no longer remain, while the tracks from Brookfield eastward toward the Mississippi River remain in use by the BNSF. The tracks from near the Missouri River in St. Joseph to roughly the eastern city limit of St. Joseph are still operated by BNSF. The track (appx 4 miles) from that point east to near the Platte River are owned and operated by Herzog Contracting. == References External links== *Rootsweb history *History of Missouri railroads Category:Predecessors of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Category:Defunct Missouri railroads Category:Rail lines receiving land grants Category:Railway companies established in 1847 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1901 Category:Quincy‚ÄìHannibal area Category:Missouri in the American Civil War Category:1847 establishments in Missouri ","title":"Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad"},{"id":"5566521","text":"Banksia Giant Candles is a registered Banksia cultivar.

They have a habit of drooping or bending occasionally. The flowers are a bronzy-orange and will be showy from late autumn through winter. They grow in most well-drained soils, and will flower best if grown in full sun. In an ideal area, they will grow up to 800 mm per year. In areas where irrigation is limited, they will not produce a heavy canopy, but will produce about 30% shade under its evergreen foliage.

The game was significant in itself as it marked the first time that an African-American athlete with a national profile and of critical importance to the success of his team, the Drake Bulldogs, had played against Oklahoma A&M; College (now Oklahoma State University) at Oklahoma A&M;'s Lewis Field. Bright's injury also highlighted the racial tensions of the times and assumed notoriety when it was captured in what was later to become both a widely disseminated and eventually Pulitzer Prize-winning photo sequence. ==Assault== Johnny Bright's participation as a halfback/quarterback in the collegiate football game between the Drake Bulldogs and Oklahoma A&M; Aggies on October 20, 1951, at Lewis Field was controversial even before it began. Bright had been the first African-American football player to play at Lewis Field two years prior (without incident). In 1951, Bright was a pre- season Heisman Trophy candidate and led the nation in total offense. Bright had never played for a losing team in his college career. Coming into the contest, Drake carried a five-game winning streak, owing much to Bright's rushing and passing abilities. It was an open secret that Oklahoma A&M; players were targeting Bright. Both Oklahoma A&M;'s student newspaper, The Daily O'Collegian, and the local newspaper, The News Press, reported that Bright was a marked man, and several A&M; students were openly claiming that Bright \\"would not be around at the end of the game\\". Although Oklahoma A&M; had integrated in 1949, the Jim Crow spirit was still very much alive on campus. During the first seven minutes of the game, Bright was knocked unconscious three times by blows from Oklahoma A&M; defensive tackle Wilbanks Smith. While Smith's final elbow blow broke Bright's jaw, he was still able to complete a 61-yard touchdown pass to Drake halfback Jim Pilkington a few plays later. Soon afterward, the injury forced him to leave the game. Bright finished the game with less than 100 yards, the first time in his three-year collegiate career. Oklahoma A&M; eventually won 27‚Äì14. Bob Spiegel, a reporter with the Des Moines Register, interviewed several spectators after the game, eventually publishing a report on the incident in the October 30, 1951, issue of the newspaper. According to Spiegel's report, several of the Oklahoma A&M; students he interviewed overheard an Oklahoma A&M; coach repeatedly say \\"Get that nigger\\" whenever the A&M; practice squad ran Drake plays against the Oklahoma A&M; starting defense prior to the October 20 game. Spiegel also recounted the experiences of a businessman and his wife, who were seated behind a group of Oklahoma A&M; practice squad players. At the beginning of the game, one of the players turned around said, \\"We're gonna get that nigger.\\" After the first blow to Bright was delivered by Smith, the same player again turned around and told the businessman, \\"See that knot on my jaw? That same guy [Smith] gave me that the very same way in practice.\\" ==Photographic sequence== A six photograph sequence of the incident captured by Des Moines Register cameramen John Robinson and Don Ultang clearly showed Smith's jaw-breaking blow was thrown well after Bright had handed the ball off to Drake fullback Gene Macomber, and was well behind the play. Robinson and Ultang had set up a camera focusing on Bright before the game after the rumors of him being targeted became too loud to ignore. They rushed the film to Des Moines as soon as Bright was knocked out of the game. Ultang said years later that they were very lucky that the incident took place when it did; they had only planned to stay through the first quarter so they could have enough time to develop the pictures before the deadline.Weber, Bruce. \\"Don Ultang, Pioneer in Aerial Photography, Dies at 91\\", The New York Times, September 27, 2008. Retrieved September 28, 2008. The sequence won Robinson and Ultang the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for Photography, and eventually made it into the November 5, 1951, issue of Life. ==Aftermath== Oklahoma A&M;'s president, Oliver Willham, denied anything happened even after evidence of the incident was published nationwide. This began a cover-up that would last over half a century; during that time, whenever the story was discussed, the standard response from A&M;/OSU was \\"no comment\\". The determination to gloss over the affair was so strong that when Robert B. Kamm succeeded Willham in 1966, he knew that he could not even discuss the matter even though he had been Drake's dean of men at the time of the incident. When it became apparent that neither Oklahoma A&M; nor the Missouri Valley Conference, to which both Drake and Oklahoma A&M; belonged, would take any disciplinary action against Smith, Drake withdrew from the MVC in protest. The Bulldogs would not return to the MVC until 1956 for non-football sports, and would not return for football until 1971. Fellow member Bradley University pulled out of the league in solidarity with Drake and did not return for non-football sports until 1955; its football team never played another down in the MVC (Bradley dropped football in 1970). The incident eventually provoked changes in NCAA football rules regarding illegal blocking, and mandated the use of more protective helmets with face guards. Johnny Bright Bright's broken jaw limited his effectiveness for the remainder of his senior season at Drake, but he earned 70 percent of the yards Drake gained and scored 70 percent of the Bulldogs' points, despite missing the better part of the final three games of the season. Bright finished fifth in the balloting for the 1951 Heisman Trophy, and played in the post-season East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl. Following his 1952 graduation from Drake, Bright went on to enjoy a 12-year professional football career in the Canadian Football League, retiring in 1964 as the CFL's all-time leading rusher, and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1970. Recalling the incident without apparent bitterness in a 1980 Des Moines Register interview three years before his death, Bright commented: \\"There's no way it couldn't have been racially motivated.\\" Bright went on to add: \\"What I like about the whole deal now, and what I'm smug enough to say, is that getting a broken jaw has somehow made college athletics better. It made the NCAA take a hard look and clean up some things that were bad.\\" When asked about Smith, whom he had not seen since the incident, Bright said he felt \\"null and void\\" about Smith, but added: \\"The thing has been a great influence on my life. My total philosophy of life now is that, whatever a person's bias and limitation, they deserve respect. Everyone's entitled to their own beliefs.\\" Wilbanks Smith Wilbanks Smith received over 1,000 letters regarding the incident. Most of the mail was hate mail or death threats, but some was congratulatory and thankful. Smith maintained that he was not racist, the hit was \\"not a racial incident,\\" and that he had landed \\"the same hit\\" on a white player earlier in the game. He never apologized for the incident, but said in 2012 that he was glad the incident had helped to integrate college football, saying \\"It took me a long time before I could smile about it. But now I can. I think it was a tool [Civil Rights'] organizations used, and it was very effective.\\" Smith died on January 14, 2020 at the age of 89.Wilbanks Smith: June 20, 1930 - January 14, 2020 OSU apology On September 28, 2005, Oklahoma State University President David J. Schmidly wrote a letter to Drake President David Maxwell formally apologizing for the incident. The apology came 22 years after Bright's death. Schmidly, reiterating a conversation earlier in the month over the phone, called the team's behavior that day \\"an ugly mark on Oklahoma State University and college football\\". ==See also== * Jack Trice *History of African Americans in the Canadian Football League ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Drake Heritage Collection - The Johnny Bright Story *The Johnny Bright Incident ‚Äì 50 Years Forgotten by Ted Soutar *KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa ‚Äì Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions *Digital file of the entire front page of newspaper with B&W; photographic prints and article Category:College football controversies Category:Drake Bulldogs football Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys football Category:African- American sports history Category:History of African-American civil rights Category:Racially motivated violence against African Americans Category:Violence in sports Category:1951 college football season Category:Racism in sport Category:Crimes in Oklahoma Category:1951 in sports in Oklahoma Category:October 1951 events Category:African-American history of Iowa Category:African-American history of Oklahoma ","title":"Johnny Bright incident"},{"id":"5566541","text":"The narrow-bridged musk turtle (Claudius angustatus) is a species in of turtle in the family Kinosternidae. The species is endemic to Central America and Mexico. ==Geographic range== C. angustatus is found in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. ==Taxonomy== As of 2010, C. angustatus is the only recognized extant species in the genus Claudius. ==Description== The narrow-bridged musk turtle is typically brown in color. The scutes of the carapace have lines and graining, imparting an almost wood-like appearance. It often has bright-yellow markings on the edges of the carapace. As it ages, algae often heavily cover the shell, masking the patterning and coloration. The head is large and bulbous for its size, with a sharp beak and a long neck. The carapace is domed, with three distinct ridges down the length. Though classified in the subfamily Staurotypinae with the \\"giant\\" musk turtles, the narrow-bridged musk turtle generally only grows to a straight carapace length of about 6.5 in (16.5 cm). ==Behavior, habitat, and diet== Like all musk turtles, the narrow- bridged musk turtle is almost entirely aquatic, and prefers habitats such as slow-moving creeks, or shallow ponds that are heavily vegetated. It spends much of its time walking along the bottom, foraging for aquatic insects and other invertebrates, and carrion. It has glands under the rear of the shell from which it can release a foul-smelling musk, hence its common name. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Turtles of the World: Claudius angustatus * ==Further reading== *Boulenger GA (1889).

It was completed in 1972. The building is owned and managed by In-Rel Management. ==History== Clark Tower was built in the early 1970s by developer William B. Clark, Sr. It was constructed to the east of the smaller White Station Tower which Clark also developed in 1967. Clark Tower and its seven-story parking garage stand on land previously occupied by 27 homes along Harvey Road. When completed in 1971, Clark Tower was the largest office building in the Mississippi Valley between St. Louis and New Orleans. It was planned to be part of a large, interconnected, mixed-use development that was to include a 400-room high-rise hotel and a regional shopping mall. Another office tower, identical to Clark Tower, was planned at the corner of Mendenhall and Sanderlin. The high-rise hotel, mall and twin tower were never built, and the adjacent land was later developed for other commercial uses. The building was designed by architect Robert Lee Hall, who also designed 100 North Main in downtown Memphis, as well as Patterson Hall at the University of Memphis. Construction began in July, 1970, with a \\"topping out\\" on July 9, 1971. Its last major renovation was in 2004. It continues to be leased as Class A office space - the highest available. The building suffered significant exterior damage from a July 22, 2003 windstorm. Several windows on Clark Tower's southwest corner were blown out. Clark Tower was a major component in the migration of the Class A office market away from downtown Memphis and into the eastern suburbs. With of leasable space, it remains the largest commercial office building in the city. ==Design features== Clark Tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks to Memphis residents and visitors. Built on relatively high ground along Poplar Avenue, it can be seen easily from vantage points eight to ten miles (16 km) away, including Bartlett and Memphis International Airport. Emporis.com lists the height of the building at , which places it at either the 2nd or 3rd in the city behind 100 North Main and the Morgan Keegan Tower (if the latter's spire is included in measurements). It is by far the tallest building outside of downtown. The main roof of is at , with a recessed penthouse and top cap located above. The building also has an attached, 7-story parking garage enclosed by a lattice-type exterior. The ground floor of this garage is retail space. Unlike the neighboring White Station Tower, Clark Tower does not have a subterranean parking garage. Clark Tower was dismissed as an architectural \\"dud\\" by Eugene J. Johnson and Robert D. Russell, Jr. in their 1990 book Memphis: An Architectural Guide. The authors claim that architect Hall was inspired by the works of Minoru Yamasaki, but failed to apply a proper sense of scale. The 33rd floor The 33rd floor of Clark Tower is now occupied by the catering firm Wade and Company. The space is open for private events. The former Tower Restaurant on the 33rd floor shut down in June 2010. The Tower Room was a public restaurant. For many years, the 33rd floor was occupied by the private Summit Club.

G. Bissinger, which was adapted as the 2004 film of the same name by Berg. It was executive produced by Brian Grazer, David Nevins, Sarah Aubrey and Jason Katims, who served as showrunner. The series is about a high school football team in the fictional town of Dillon, a small, close-knit community in rural Texas. The series features an ensemble cast, led by Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, who portray a high school football coach Eric Taylor and his wife Tami Taylor, a high school faculty member. The rest of the primary cast includes characters associated with football and high school. The series uses this small-town backdrop to address many issues facing contemporary American culture, including family values, school funding, racism, drugs, abortion and lack of economic opportunities. Produced by NBCUniversal, Friday Night Lights premiered on October 3, 2006. It aired for two seasons on NBC. In May 2007, the series was renewed for a second season to consist of 19 episodes, but due to the writer's strike, it was shortened to 15 episodes. Although the show had garnered critical acclaim and passionate fans, the series suffered low ratings and was in danger of cancellation after the second season. To save the series, NBC struck a deal with DirecTV to co-produce three more seasons; each subsequent season premiered on DirecTV's 101 Network, with NBC rebroadcasts a few months later. The series ended its run on The 101 Network on February 9, 2011, after five seasons. Though Friday Night Lights never garnered a sizable audience, it was a critical success, lauded for its realistic portrayal of Middle America and deep exploration of its central characters. The show appeared on a number of best lists and was awarded a Peabody Award, a Humanitas Prize, a Television Critics Association Award and several technical Primetime Emmy Awards. At the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards, the show was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton also scored multiple nominations for the Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress awards for a drama series. Executive producer Jason Katims was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. Chandler and Katims each won the Emmy in 2011. ==Background==  Inspiration Friday Night Lights was inspired by H.G. \\"Buzz\\" Bissinger's non-fiction book Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream (1990) and the 2004 film based on it. The book, which explores the 1988 season of the Permian Panthers, a high school football team in Odessa, Texas, was a factual work of documentary journalism. The people featured were not renamed in the book. The Universal Pictures film, which stars Billy Bob Thornton and was directed by Peter Berg, Bissinger's second cousin, based its characters on the residents of Odessa c. 1988. Conception Peter Berg, who directed the film, developed the series, and wrote and directed the pilot episode. Once filming on the movie was completed, Berg began to explore adapting the story for television. Berg later said he had regretted having to jettison many of the interpersonal topics from the book because of the time constraints of a feature film. Creating a TV series, particularly one based on fictional characters, allowed him to address many of those elements in-depth. He decided to set the series in a fictional town of Dillon, Texas, with some characteristics of Odessa. The football team was given the Panthers name. Berg deliberately carried elements from the film to the series, particularly for the pilot, which was closely related to the film. He cast Connie Britton as the wife of head coach Eric Taylor, and Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity, a major businessman and football booster, in roles similar to those they played in the film. ==Production== Filming for the show's pilot began in February 2006 in Austin, Texas. Berg said he required filming the pilot and eventually the show in Texas as \\"a deal breaker\\" in order to agree to participate weekly in the project. The show features homages to its Texas heritage. In the pilot, Berg featured former Texas Longhorns football coach Mack Brown as a Dillon booster and had a caller to the fictional Panther Radio compare Panthers' coach Eric Taylor to Brown. The pilot referred to much of the surrounding area in its scenes. Football scenes were filmed at Pflugerville High School's Kuempel Stadium and at the RRISD Complex. The Dillon Panther football team and coaches' uniforms were based on the uniforms of the Pflugerville Panthers. Some of the scenes were filmed at Texas School for the Deaf. Berg's observation of local high school students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development of some of the characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio‚Äôs Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot. Performances While relying on a script each week, the producers decided at the outset to allow the cast leeway in what they said and did on the show. Their decisions could affect the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene. If the actors felt that something was untrue to their character or a mode of delivery didn't work, they were free to change it, provided they still hit the vital plot points. This freedom was complemented by filming without rehearsal and without extensive blocking. Camera operators were trained to follow the actors, rather than having the actors stand in one place with cameras fixed around them. The actors knew that the filming would work around them. Executive producer Jeffrey Reiner described this method as \\"no rehearsal, no blocking, just three cameras and we shoot.\\" Working in this fashion profoundly influenced everyone involved with the show. Series star Kyle Chandler said: \\"When I look back at my life, I'm going to say, 'Wow, [executive producer] Peter Berg really changed my life.'\\" Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment, saying: \\"When I first came on [the FNL] set, I thought, it‚Äôs interesting ‚Äì this is what I imagined filmmaking would be, before I saw what filmmaking was.\\" Filming All five seasons of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville. With the show yielding roughly $33 million a year in revenue, other states courted the production company after the state of Texas failed to pay all the rebates it had promised to the show's producers. The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states, and the production company preferred to stay near Austin, so the show remained in Texas. Friday Night Lights is unusual for using actual locations rather than stage sets and sound stage. These factors together with reliance on filming hundreds of locals as extras, gives the series an authentic feel and look. The producers used a documentary-style filming technique. Three cameras were used for each shoot and entire scenes were shot in one take. In contrast, most productions film a scene from each angle and typically repeat the scene several times while readjusting lighting to accommodate each shot. The first takes usually made the final cut. By filming a scene all at once, the producers tried to create an environment for the actors that was more organic and allowed for the best performances. The series borrowed the uniforms, cheerleaders, fans and stadium of the Pflugerville Panthers. Producers shot Pflugerville games and used them as game footage in the series. University of Southern California football announcers Peter Arbogast and Paul McDonald provided off-screen commentary during the football game sequences. The facilities, colors and bobcat logos of Texas State University in San Marcos were used as the setting and creative inspiration for the fictional Texas Methodist University. The show features the fictional Herrmann Field, named for George Herrmann, the head coach of the Pflugerville Panthers. Some scenes were filmed outside Texas. On June 20, 2010, scenes were filmed at Temple University, which was to portray the fictional Braemore College. An episode from Julie's senior year in high school was filmed in the Boston area, at Boston College, Boston University, and Tufts University. Some scenes at fictional Oklahoma Tech University were filmed at Gregory Gym at The University of Texas at Austin. Marketing Promotional website with Toyota. Initially targeted at the youth market, the show emphasized the football element. NBC teamed with social networking site Bebo to create a site that allowed students to upload video and photos, as well as create blogs about their local football teams. Students who participated were eligible for one of 10 $5,000 scholarships. NBC had negotiated with Bebo for network and series promotion on Bebo's network of youth-oriented sites including Piczo, Hi5, Tickle, Ringo, and FastWeb. To complement this promotion, NBC sent out ‚ÄúSchool Spirit‚Äù kits to 1,000 high schools around the country. These kits included posters, pom-poms, mini-footballs and disposable cameras, all bearing the show's logo. The kits also contained copies of the show's pilot episode on DVD. The network repeated this promotion for its second season promotion, when it teamed with HouseParty.com to send out 1,000 \\"Party Kits,\\" which contained advance copies of the Season 2 opener along with other promotional material. NBC also paired with Toyota to create the \\"Hometown Sweepstakes\\", in which students could earn cash grants of up to $50,000 for their school's athletics program. It was open to high school students ages 14 to 18 and was designed to draw people to the show's official website, where they could download AOL Instant Messenger icons, screensavers and desktop wallpaper. Students who registered could also download free movie theater passes to special early screenings of the pilot episode. These movie theater screenings took place in 50 cities nationwide and ran until a week before the show premiered on NBC. In the later part of the season, NBC chose to switch course and pursue the female demographic. The network designed a strategy based on the personal elements of the show, giving the show the tagline, \\"It‚Äôs about life\\". NBC Marketing President Vince Manze stressed that the goal was to ensure viewers that the show was family and relationships as well as athletics. The network ran 30-second spots in movie theaters that featured cast members and fans being interviewed about the show. ==Cast and characters== Young members of the Friday Night Lights cast As a show about the community of Dillon, Texas, Friday Night Lights has an ensemble cast. The show features Panthers' football coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler), who strives to balance his work, family, status in a sometimes confrontational community and his personal ambitions. His family ‚Äì wife Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), a guidance counselor turned principal at Dillon High, and teenage daughter Julie Taylor (Aimee Teegarden) ‚Äì are also central to the show. Coach Taylor and Tami are the only two characters to appear in every episode. Outside of the Taylor family, the show explores the lives of the Dillon high school football players. In the pilot, Coach Taylor's protege and star quarterback Jason Street (Scott Porter) suffers an in-game spinal injury that ends his football career. He faces life as a paraplegic. At first, Street struggles with these disabilities and the upturn of his life. Gradually, he copes with his new reality. Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly), his girlfriend, undergoes her own changes, making a transition from a Panthers cheerleader to a Christian youth leader. Because of Street's injury, sophomore Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford), who is quiet and reserved, becomes the Panthers' starting quarterback. He eventually dates the coach's daughter, Julie. Saracen's father is serving as a soldier in Iraq, so he is the sole caretaker for his grandmother Lorraine Saracen (Louanne Stephens). Saracen receives little help, except from his best friend Landry Clarke (Jesse Plemons). Star running back Brian \\"Smash\\" Williams (Gaius Charles) works to get a college football scholarship. Fullback Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch) struggles with alcoholism and complicated family problems. His older brother Billy Riggins (Derek Phillips), while not his legal guardian, serves as Tim's caretaker. Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki) stars as a town vixen who wants to leave Dillon for a better life. Involved with Riggins, Tyra eventually develops a complicated relationship with Landry Clarke. The fourth and fifth seasons shift focus to the East Dillon Lions, now coached by Eric Taylor. The fourth season introduces several new characters, including Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan), a talented athlete who has never played football before, but he rises to stardom as the team's quarterback. Luke Cafferty (Matt Lauria) is a running back and is romantically with Becky Sproles (Madison Burge), a beauty-queen hopeful who has complicated family issues; Becky also develops a deep relationship with Riggins. Jess Merriweather (Jurnee Smollett), an East Dillon student who works at her father's restaurant and cares for her three younger brothers; she briefly dates Landry and has a relationship with Vince; and shows aspirations of being a football coach. Hastings Ruckle (Grey Damon) is introduced in the fifth season, a basketball player turned football player, who serves as a receiver for the Lions. ==Plot== Season one Season one revolves around two main events: Coach Eric Taylor beginning as head coach and the injury and paralysis of star quarterback Jason Street in the first game of the season. Coach Taylor's career depends on his ability to get the Dillon Panthers to the state championship, despite the loss of Street. If the team suffers a losing streak, he knows his family will no longer be welcome in Dillon. His wife Tami Taylor begins work as a guidance counselor at the local high school. Over the course of the season, she becomes a support and a mentor to many of the students, and her position plays a pivotal role in the season finale. Jason Street and Matt Saracen each struggle within extremely difficult conditions. Street must learn to live with his disability in a town that worships athletics. Saracen has to face new challenges as a lead athlete. As Street's friendship with Herc, his rehab roommate and wheelchair rugby teammate, grows stronger, so do his will and independence. For the quiet Matt, who seldom plays football, his new role of QB1 calls for a different part of him. Motherless, he also cares for his grandmother while his father is fighting in Iraq. Matt falls in love with Coach Taylor's daughter, Julie, who loathes Texas small town life and dislikes football. She falls for Matt and their relationship slowly blossoms over the season. Also explored is the pressure on the cocky, driven Brian \\"Smash\\" Williams. Easily the most promising player on the Panthers' roster, he works hard to achieve excellence and sees his future career as instrumental in gaining a better life for him and his family. Since his father was killed in a car accident, his mother Corrina has taken multiple jobs to keep the family afloat. Smash decides to take performance-enhancing drugs to ensure he can gain a college football scholarship. Tim Riggins is struggling with alcoholism and absentee parents, with few prospects beyond high school. He is portrayed as a loyal friend with a good heart. Tyra Collette also comes from a broken home; her mother suffers abusive relationships with men. Tyra begins the season as Riggins‚Äô girlfriend. Thanks to counselor Tami Taylor and Landry Clarke ‚Äì the school math geek and Saracen's best friend ‚Äì Tyra starts to see hope that she might get out of Dillon and break the cycle of women in her family. Meanwhile, Lyla Garrity undergoes significant changes. Faced with Jason's injury, she begins seeing Riggins for some comfort. Jason begins growing closer to another woman. Lyla learns about her father's many adulterous affairs and begins to establish her independence. Season two Season two begins with Coach Taylor living and working in Austin as an assistant coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling with the demands of the new baby and Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, Bill McGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim so hard he passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt actually come to blows on the field and a crucial game is won by Smash, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return. Julie continues to act out. She ends her romantic relationship with Matt, whom she sees as turning into a replica of her father, and pursues an older man, \\"the Swede,\\" who works with her as a lifeguard at the local pool. When she finds the Swede has no interest in a serious relationship, she begins a friendship with a young teacher that her mother feels is inappropriate. Tami confronts the teacher at school, but some students overhear the conversation and spread rumors about Julie; Julie is mortified and furious at her mother. Meanwhile, Coach Taylor attempts to win games with the Panthers but faces a number of issues. Tim is kicked off the team after missing a week of practice when he leaves on the spur of the moment to go with Jason Street to Mexico to look for a treatment for Jason's paralysis. On returning to Dillon, Tim finds that a neighbor woman, with whom he had a brief affair, is now seeing his brother Billy and has all but moved into their house. Tim moves out but has trouble finding another place to live and ultimately returns. Coach Taylor allows him to rejoin the team after he shows up at practice and on his own initiative apologizes to everyone on the team for his lack of commitment. Lyla Garrity becomes increasingly involved in an organization for young Christians. As part of a religious outreach program, she befriends a young convict, Santiago Herrera, who is released from juvenile detention shortly after they first meet. She gets him a job at her father Buddy's car dealership. Buddy encourages Santiago to try out for football after noticing his superior speed and coordination. When Taylor expresses interest in the boy, it is discovered that his legal guardian has left town and he has no adult in his life. Buddy agrees to take legal responsibility for him. Smash is courted by a number of college recruiters. He makes it clear his priority is a quick route to the NFL, leading to tension between him and his mother, who insists his priority should be getting an education. Smash accepts a scholarship to the prestigious TMU. However, Smash punches a white teenager who sexually harasses his sister when they're at the movies. This turns into a blown-out-of-proportion racial incident, and Smash is deemed someone who has \\"character issues.\\" His scholarship to TMU is revoked. He later commits to Whitmore University, a smaller historically black college that is more highly regarded for its academics than its athletic programs. The football coach at Whitmore has a strong relationship with Coach Taylor, and had been scouting Smash since he was in middle school. Matt begins a relationship with a cheerleader before leaving her for his grandmother's new live-in nurse, Carlotta. Additionally, the early season follows an arc where Landry kills and hides the body of a man who attempted to rape Tyra, leading to a romance between the two. Eventually, guilt builds within Landry and he confesses. Charges are not pressed, although tension between him and Tyra remains. Landry also joins the football team. Jason Street impregnates a woman in what was supposed to be a one-night stand at the end of season two. Jason pleads with the woman to keep the child and promises to take care of the two. This season ends on a cliffhanger due to the Writers' Strike. The show's head writer and executive producer, Jason Katims, stated that this last episode was ‚Äúnot in any way viewed as the season finale... If we were leading to the end of the season [under normal circumstances], we would have most likely brought the story around to the coach and his family again,‚Äù and there would have been a strong football element as well, Katims said. Seven of the 22 episodes NBC ordered for Season 2 weren't made. Season three The season began with Coach Taylor failing to lead the Panthers to another State championship the year before, creating new pressure for him. Quarterback Matt Saracen's position is threatened by the arrival of freshman J.D. McCoy, an amazing natural talent who comes from a rich family with an overbearing father, Joe. Matt moves to wide receiver after Taylor names J.D. starting quarterback. Tyra starts dating a cowboy named Cash, leading to complications in her relationship with Landry. Tim and Lyla start dating. Tami Taylor becomes the principal of Dillon High School and fights with Buddy Garrity about the allocation of funds toward a Jumbotron. Smash Williams, who injured his knee during the previous year's playoffs, rediscovers his love for the game. Billy, Tim, Herc, and Jason decide to flip Buddy Garrity's house for a profit. Matt and Julie reconcile and rekindle their romance. Smash gets a tryout with Texas A&M;, and succeeds in winning a spot on their team. Lyla helps Tim pursue a college football scholarship. Tim initially puts off the recruiter and is concerned Lyla is trying to turn him into someone he's not by encouraging him to pursue college, but he sees she's looking out for his best interests. Buddy loses money, which is Lyla's college fund, in a bad business deal and he retaliates by trashing the strip club, The Landing Strip. Lyla wants to attend Vanderbilt University and after Buddy loses the money, she considers going to San Antonio State University, the school that gives Tim a scholarship. Lyla moves in with Tim after she and her father have a fight. Billy Riggins gets engaged to Tyra's older sister Mindy. Mindy is pregnant at the time of their engagement. Jason Street eventually finds a job at a sports agency in New York City, after visiting a former Panthers player who is now playing professionally, and moves to the northeast to be close to his girlfriend and newborn baby. Matt is pushed back into his former football role in the playoffs. While Eric Taylor and Buddy Garrity were making a visit to a possible recruit who just moved into town, the coach learns of a plot to have him replaced as head coach of the Dillon Panthers. They learn that Joe McCoy wants Taylor replaced with Wade Aikmen, J.D.'s personal coach. After the school's administration meets to decide who gets the coaching job, Aikmen is offered the job at Dillon High School, while Taylor is offered the job of coaching at recently reopened East Dillon High School. Billy and Mindy's wedding ends the season. Season four Season 4 kicks off with Eric Taylor struggling as the East Dillon High coach. The team, field and conditions are a complete change from the privileged and sparkling conditions at West Dillon. East Dillon High resembles Odessa High from the source novel Friday Night Lights, Permian High's sister school and the home of the Odessa Bronchos, with whom they have an annual rivalry match which divides the town. The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers. Additionally, Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school, and serve a predominantly poor minority community. Additionally, the school district boundaries between East and West Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon; the districts between Permian and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner. As Coach begins putting together his new Lion team, he realizes he's in for more than he bargained for. The players who try out are less than desirable, but Coach gets a lucky break with a couple of new faces. The first is Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan), a student who has gotten in trouble with the law too many times. He is given one last chance if he plays football for the East Dillon Lions. Although he has no prior football experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback. The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon. Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property. Although she is in love with Tim, she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home. The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant. Even though she is a student at East Dillon, she seeks out Tami's help with the situation. Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion. Her mother goes with her to the procedure. Parents find out about this and led by Luke's mother, seek Mrs. Taylor's dismissal as principal. When Tami refuses to apologize, as she followed procedure, she is put on leave. She decides to return to her role as a guidance counselor, but at East Dillon. The football season is one focused on growth and reestablishing a sense of Lion pride. The culmination of their hard work is tested in their last game of the season as they play the Dillon Panthers led by J.D. McCoy. In an amazing show of perseverance, the East Dillon Lions defeat the Dillon Panthers, ruining the Panthers' playoff chances. In season four, Matt Saracen struggles with staying in Dillon and living as a townie. He turned down an art school in Chicago and is instead studying art at the local technical college. After returning from a hunting trip with Tim Riggins, he finds out that his father was killed in Iraq. The episode \\"The Son\\" shows Matt going through the five stages of grief as he comes to accept the death of his father, a man he claims to hate. This episode garnered much buzz online and resulted in a failed campaign for Zach Gilford to get an Emmy nomination in the guest actor category; however, the episode did get an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. After this emotionally charged episode, Matt abruptly moves to Chicago without saying goodbye to his girlfriend or best friend. He returns briefly in the finale and makes amends with both Julie and Landry, who ends up flying back to Chicago with Matt. The character of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic to a young man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that the only way they can make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as \\"number 33\\" giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail. Season five Season 5, the final season, opens with summer wrapping up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor as a special teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is faced with the challenge of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, and the rest of the team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to take a good look at what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father. He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player. Julie looks for support first from her parents, and then from her old boyfriend Matt Saracen, who is living in Chicago and attending art school. Julie drives up to spend some time with him, but leaves still confused about her future. Tim is up for parole, and with the help of Coach Taylor and Buddy Garrity, is approved for early release. Buddy gives him a job as a bartender at his bar. Tim is angry with his brother Billy and threatens to move to Alaska to work on a pipeline but Tyra Collette comes back for a visit to Dillon and tells him he needs to repair his relationship with Billy. After they spend the night together, she asks Tim to show her his land, and the episode closes with Tyra asking, \\"Alaska, Tim?\\" to which Tim smiles a guilty smile. In the last episode, East Dillon wins the state championship after Coach Taylor and Vince share a moment of respect for each other. Coach Taylor then moves with his wife to Philadelphia as she accepts the job as Dean of Admissions at a prestigious school, and the show ends showing them living happily. Tim and Tyra talk about their dreams and a potential future at his new home site. Julie is engaged to Matt and lives with him in Chicago. Vince is the quarterback of the Dillon Panthers \\"Superteam\\", consisting of both East and West Dillon High School athletes, joined by Buddy Jr., Tinker, and possibly Hastings. Jess is living in Dallas, and helping to student coach a team and is following her dreams. Billy is expecting twins with Mindy. Luke Cafferty is seen with Becky at the bus depot departing for the Army. The second to the last scene is of Tim and Billy, taking a break while putting up the frame of Tim's new house. They sit back, crack open a beer, and Billy toasts, \\"Texas Forever?\\" to which Tim responds emphatically, \\"Texas Forever\\" and they clink their beers. The series ends with Eric coaching a new high school team in Philadelphia (in a noticeably smaller stadium than those in Texas). After practice, Eric recites the phrase: \\"Clear eyes, full hearts...\\" After not getting the normal response of \\"Can't lose,\\" he says, \\"We'll deal with that later.\\" Tami then shows up and the two walk off the field as the lights turn off. ==Reception==  Critical response Connie Britton and Kyle Chandler received unanimous praise for their performances throughout the series. Although the series never had a high viewership, it was met with critical acclaim and has a strong fan-base. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season received a score of 78 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Virginia Heffernan wrote for The New York Times that \\"if the season is anything like the pilot, this new drama about high school football could be great ‚Äì and not just television great, but great in the way of a poem or painting.\\" The Washington Post similarly praised the series as \\"extraordinary in just about every conceivable way.\\" Bill Simmons, a former columnist for ESPN Magazine implored readers of his column in the September 24, 2007 issue to watch the show, calling it \\"the greatest sports- related show ever made.\\" Positive reviews also came from USA Today, the San Francisco Chronicle, and international sources, with The Guardian's Jonathan Bernstien calling the pilot \\"beautifully shot\\" and the Metro awarding it 4 out of 5 stars. Throughout its inaugural season, many online journalists responded positively to the show. Matt Roush of TV Guide dedicated several of his \\"Roush Dispatch\\" columns to the show calling the last episodes of season one \\"terrifically entertaining\\" while Zap2it's Amy Amatangelo asked her readers to \\"promise to watch [the last 4 episodes of] Friday Night Lights.\\" The show's pilot did, however, receive negative reviews as well. The Philadelphia Inquirer's review was particularly harsh, calling the show a \\"standard high school sports soap opera.\\" Season two reviews were considerably less positive than for the first, with the Landry and Tyra murder plot being particularly panned by critics. The Los Angeles Times said that the show had lost its innocence, while The Boston Globe said the event was \\"out of sync with the real-life tone of the show.\\" Others were more positive, though, with Variety saying \\"faith should be shown in showrunner/writer Jason Katims\\" while The New York Times said \\"to hold Friday Night Lights to a measure of realism would be to miss what are its essentially expressionistic pleasures.\\" Time Out magazine's Andrew Johnston included the series in his list of the ten best TV shows for both 2006 and 2007, stating \\"Who'd have thought a tribute to heartland values would turn out to be the most avant-garde show on TV? The music and random close-ups said more than the dialogue in Peter Berg's phenomenal football drama.\\"Time Out New York, 12/28/2006-1/3/2007, p. 150.Time Out New York, 12/27/2007-1/2/2008, p. 153. Time magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 Returning Series of 2007, ranking it at No. 4. In 2007, AOL ranked Friday Night Lights the fifth Best School Show of All Time. The same year, the show placed No. 71 on Entertainment Weekly \\"New TV Classics\\" list. In 2009, Alan Sepinwall placed it in his \\"Best of the '00s in TV: Best Dramas\\" and wrote: \\"Few shows are as willing to so directly confront the emotions of its characters, aided by central performances ‚Äî as one of TV‚Äôs most realistic and loving couples ‚Äî from Chandler and Connie Britton.\\" The A.V. Club named it the 16th best TV series of the 2000s. In 2010, Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online ranked it number 4 on her list, \\"Top 20 TV Series of the Past 20 Years\\". Friday Night Lights final season was lauded by critics. Based on 10 reviews, the season obtained a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\" and it was included on numerous best lists. Poniewozik ranked it No. 7 on his list of 2011's Top 10 TV Series, saying, \\"The final season of this drama came down, as you would expect, to a final dramatic game. But the real action was always just as much in the stands\\". He also ranked the final episode \\"Always\\" No. 1 on 2011's Top 10 TV Episodes list. Paste also named it one of the 20 best TV shows of 2011 and Slant Magazine ranked Friday Night Lights No. 10 on its list of 2011's 25 Best TV Shows, concluding \\"The show's true concerns‚Äîobsession, class, family‚Äîwere articulated beautifully as ever in the quiet, familiar relationships between a town and its team, and a coach and his wife\\". The Salt Lake Tribune in its list of the Top 10 series of 2011 ranked Friday Night Lights No. 1 explaining \\"For five seasons, Friday Night Lights was both the simplest and most complex show on TV. It felt like real life, and real life is complicated.\\" TV Guide named the show among its Best TV Shows of 2011 praising the fact that \\"Friday Night Lights left its fans with the best portrait of a marriage ever on TV\\". It was also included on The Huffington Posts and E! Online's 2011's Best TV Shows. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked Friday Night Lights No. 22 in its of the \\"101 Best Written TV Series of All Time\\". Awards and accolades Friday Night Lights won a Peabody Award, three AFI awards, an Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, an ACE Eddie Award for editing, an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing, a Television Critics Association Award, and has earned multiple Writers Guild of America nominations. The show's two leading actors, Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, received Emmy nominations for their performances in 2010, while executive producer Jason Katims won two Humanitas Prize awards for writing. In 2011, after concluding its run, the show was honored by four Emmy nominations and Kyle Chandler won the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Jason Katims won for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for \\"Always\\". Fan base Friday Night Lights enjoys what former NBC President Kevin Reilly called a \\"passionate and vocal [fanbase]\\". This fan dedication has shown itself in everything from advertisers expressing their support for the show to news outlets getting massive amounts of support mail after running positive pieces about the show. After some statements made by NBC's Entertainment head Ben Silverman about the future of the show and the fact that everything seemed to point that Friday Night Lights wouldn't return after the writers' strike, fans put together several campaigns. Save FNL Campaign raised money to send footballs and contributions to charity foundations that were related to the show. The Save FNL Campaign raised a total of $15,840 for 18,750 footballs, $2061 for charity, and $924 worth of DVDs for troops stationed overseas. ==Television ratings==  U.S. ratings Though it was critically acclaimed, Friday Night Lights never enjoyed high ratings. The first two seasons averaged roughly 6 million viewers each. Ratings dropped in subsequent seasons with the third season averaging 4.6 million viewers, the fourth season with 3.8 million, and fifth season with 3.6 million. International ratings The show's pilot, which aired on February 21, 2007 on ITV4, was watched by 26,000 viewers in the UK. This was attributed to the program being aired opposite of the Barcelona‚ÄìLiverpool football game in the first knockout round of the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Champions League. DVR ratings On December 29, 2006 Nielsen Media Research reported the results of having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a Digital Video Recorder to record shows for later viewing. These ratings, called \\"live plus seven\\", include all viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing. According to the Nielsen numbers, DVR viewers increased Friday Night Lights ratings by 7.5% overall in December. When Nielsen monitored viewers again in April 2007 the increase went up to 17% for the week ending on April 8. Affluent viewers On March 5, 2007, Media Life Magazine reported that Friday Night Lights was one of the most popular shows among \\"affluent viewers\\" who had little experience playing football. This was determined using a report from Magna Global who in turn used analysis done by Nielsen Media Research. Affluence in the study was determined by yearly income. In the study, Friday Night Lights tied for the 11th most watched show by affluent viewers. According to the study viewers of the show have a median household income of $65,000 per year. ==Distribution==  Online episodes Streaming videos, such as cast interviews and the full episode from the previous week, have been available on NBC.com since the series‚Äô inception. In December 2006, NBC expanded this selection to include every episode of the season. The move to offer every episode was made for only a few select shows and represents a marketing push on NBC's part. In addition to the free ad-support offerings, every episode of Friday Night Lights became available for download on the iTunes Store on February 10, 2007 for $1.99 per episode. As a special promotion, the pilot was initially offered as a free download. The series was available on Netflix through October 1, 2017. Syndication ABC Family acquired syndication rights for the first four seasons and began airing reruns September 6, 2010, but it was pulled on October 18, 2010, due to low ratings. In July 2011, it was announced that ESPN Classic had acquired the rights of all five seasons and started airing the series beginning on July 12, 2011. In an attempt to bolster series ratings, NBC repositioned reruns of the show to air on its sister network Bravo, during the weeks leading up to the season one finale on NBC. These episodes aired on a schedule of one hour every Friday and three hours every Saturday. Bravo is known to have an audience that is upscale and largely female, which is in line with the new strategy of NBC's then-President Kevin Reilly (now at FOX) for selling the show. When questioned about this strategy, he admitted to having regrets about initially marketing the show incorrectly, saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so clear to me that [the marketing for] the show ended up confusing people in terms of what [the public thought] it was supposed to be\\". He said he felt the show is, at its core, a ‚Äúwomen's show‚Äù, and his wish is that the marketing had reflected that to a greater extent. Once the 2006‚Äì2007 television season ended, NBC planned to air reruns throughout the summer in the hopes of gaining new viewers during the summer hiatus. Despite rising ratings for the reruns, NBC abruptly pulled them from the network's schedule on June 24, 2007. NBC resumed airing reruns in late August/early September, timed to the Season 1 DVD release. TeenNick acquired the rights in 2015 and began airing the series, in chronological order, on April 10, 2015 with a week-long event in which three episodes aired nightly. DirecTV During the 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike, NBC Universal's decision to release the Season 2 DVD with only the 15 produced episodes and comments by NBC chief Ben Silverman led to speculation that the show would be canceled. In March 2008, it was confirmed that NBC had picked up the series for a third season, after a cost-sharing partnership between NBC and DirecTV was struck. The agreement had first run episodes airing exclusively on DirecTV, and the episodes aired on NBC at a later date. Season 3 premiered exclusively on DirecTV channel 101, with the episodes replaying on NBC beginning on January 16, 2009. In March 2009, NBC announced it had renewed the series for two more seasons. ==Home media releases== DVD and Blu-ray The first season was released on DVD in region 1 on August 28, 2007, and in region 2 on October 29, 2007.

The fifth season was released on DVD in region 1 on April 5, 2011, and in region 2 on August 12, 2013. Special features include deleted scenes from several episodes, audio commentaries for \\"Don't Go\\" and \\"Always\\", a featurette titled \\"The Lights Go Out\\", and a photo gallery. A complete series box set containing all the episodes and material from the individual season sets was released in region 1 on October 4, 2011. In March 2016, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in region 1; they subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on September 6, 2016. On September 26, 2017, Mill Creek Entertainment re-released the complete series on DVD and also released the complete series on Blu-ray for the first time; however, these releases lacked the previously included special features. Soundtracks Two soundtracks with music featured on the show were released. The first, Friday Night Lights, was released in 2007, and included music from The Killers, OutKast, and Explosions in the Sky, who had produced the score for the film. The second soundtrack, Friday Night Lights Vol. 2, was released in 2010, and included the main \\"Friday Night Lights Theme\\" by W. G. Walden. The score for both the film and television show, along with all background music and all instrumental music is performed by Explosions in the Sky. ==Cancelled film sequel== In July 2011, it was revealed that creator and executive producer Peter Berg was interested in continuing the series, as a feature film. In August 2011, Berg said at a Television Critics Association panel that the Friday Night Lights film is in development. Berg was quoted as saying \\"We're very serious about trying to do it\\", adding that the script is currently being written. Universal Pictures and Imagine Television would produce the film, with Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton set to return. In May 2013, executive producer Brian Grazer confirmed the continued development to make a film. In December 2013, it was confirmed by Berg that a film would not be moving forward. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:2000s American high school television series Category:2000s American teen drama television series Category:2006 American television series debuts Category:2010s American high school television series Category:2010s American teen drama television series Category:2011 American television series endings Category:American football in Texas Category:American sports television series Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:High school sports in Texas Category:Peabody Award-winning television programs Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series Category:Live action television shows based on films Category:Television series about families Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows filmed in Texas Category:Television shows set in Texas Category:Serial drama television series Category:Works about high school football in the United States Category:Audience (TV network) original programming ","title":"Friday Night Lights (TV series)"},{"id":"5566684","text":"Highland School is an independent school located in Warrenton, Virginia.

Peter Phippen, BBC Magazines' Managing Director had planned on the release of a news-based magazine since mid-1990s. PATA was expected to correspond with BBC World for Project Phoenix on a subproject, Travel Profiles, to promote Asian- Pacific travel. Other promotions were to be done by CNN International and National Geographic, and in print titles such as TIME, Fortune, and Newsweek. Australia, Canada, Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore were to be the biggest contributors to the project. ==ReferencesExternal links== *BBC Magazines website Category:BBC publications ","title":"BBC Newsbrief magazine"},{"id":"5566698","text":"Small Heath railway station serves the areas of Small Heath and Sparkbrook in Birmingham, West Midlands, England.

The current minimal level of service at the station is provided by West Midlands Trains services between Birmingham Snow Hill and Stratford-upon-Avon. The station is the least used in the West Midlands county with 20,688 passengers using it annually. The single island platform is above street level, as the railway line here is on a viaduct. The only public access is from Coventry Road, directly underneath the railway bridge. ==History== Bordesley station was opened in 1855 by the Great Western Railway on their main line from London (Paddington) to Birkenhead (Woodside). It was originally a two platform station, but was rebuilt as a four platform station with two island platforms when the line was upgraded to four tracks during 1915. The station once had extensive cattle sidings adjacent to and on Duddeston Viaduct. This viaduct was intended to link the line from Bordesley to the Derby Line but was left incomplete when it was realised that trains would be unable to serve Birmingham Curzon Street railway station, where rail services then terminated.. View SE, towards Leamington and the south in 1962 The station still carries the painted lettering \\"BR(W) Bordesley Cattle Station\\", and \\"Bordesley Cattle Station GWR\\" from the time when, as part of the Great Western Railway and later British Rail's (Western) region, it was used to bring cattle from the countryside to the Bull Ring markets. The station was downgraded in the 1960s to minimal facilities and services, and one island platform was taken out of use. ==Services== Since May 2007, the station has been served by a single weekly parliamentary train in one direction only. Currently this is the 13:18 train from Whitlocks End to Great Malvern which calls at Bordesley at 13:36 on Saturdays only. The station primarily serves as a match day stop for nearby St Andrew's stadium of Birmingham City Football Club, and additional services stop there when there are home fixtures. ==ReferencesExternal links== *History of the station with old photos *Descriptive tour with modern photos Category:Railway stations in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1855 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1915 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1915 Category:Railway stations served by West Midlands Trains ","title":"Bordesley railway station"},{"id":"5566738","text":"Picasa Web Albums (PWA) was an image hosting and sharing web service from Google, often compared to Flickr and similar sites. The service links with Google's photo organizing desktop program Picasa. It was discontinued in May 2016 and succeeded by Google Photos which does not support sharing photo albums on the public world wide web. It allowed users with a Google account to store and share photos in public albums with an initial free storage offering of 15 GB, that is shared with Gmail and Google Drive. Storage was unlimited for photos of resolution less than 2048x2048 pixels for Google+ users, and for photos of resolution less than 800x800 for everyone else. Videos shorter than 15 minutes also don't count towards the limit. Once the storage is full, uploaded photos are automatically resized to fit the resolution for unlimited storage. On February 12, 2016, Google announced that the service as well as the application will be discontinued on May 1, 2016 and March 15, 2016, respectively. Existing users of the application will still be able to use the application. Existing users of the service were advised to use Google Photos, which already stores the photos in Picasa Web Albums and is a new place for viewing, downloading and deleting (but not editing or organizing) the albums along with their meta-data will be created in the future.Picasa Blog: Moving on from Picasa, googlephotos.blogspot.co.il. ==Features== Users may upload pictures through a variety of ways: via the PWA web interface on supported browsers,Creating New Albums: Upload using Picasa Web Albums, Picasa Help. Picasa 2.5 or later on Microsoft Windows, using the Exporter for iPhoto, the Aperture to Picasa Web Albums plug-in, Uploader on Mac OS X, F-Spot on Linux, or through WAManager in the Amiga-like OS MorphOS. In both free and paid accounts, the actual resolution of the photo is maintained, even though a smaller resolution photo may be displayed by the web interface. In Picasa 3 versions of the software, using the 'original size' upload option, pixel size remains the same, but JPEG compression is increased significantly during upload to PWA. As JPEG is a \\"lossy\\" format, some picture information (and quality) is lost. Picasa 3.6 added an option to preserve original JPEG quality. PWA uses an \\"unlisted number\\" approach for URLs for private photo albums. This enables a user to email a private album's URL to anyone, and the recipient can view the album without having to create a user account. This is done via an \\"authentication key\\" that must be appended to the URL for the album to be shown. The Picasa Help files say that private albums are not searchable by anyone except the user. Another visibility option named \\"sign-in required to view\\" is available. This makes the album viewable only to those with whom the album is explicitly shared. Ads are shown on the free Picasa Web Albums accounts. The Terms of Service permit Google to use the uploaded photos to display on their website or via RSS feeds, and also for promoting Google services royalty-free. Additionally, the terms permit Google to allow other companies with which they are affiliated to use the uploaded pictures to provide syndicated services. This allowance is perpetual and cannot be revoked by the owner of the photos. Picasa Web Albums was first leaked on June 6, 2006. When introduced, it came with 250 MB of free space. On March 7, 2007, that was upgraded to 1 GB. As stated above, storage is now unlimited for small and resized photos. Users can rent additional storage space (shared between Gmail, Google Drive and Picasa Web Albums) through a paid monthly subscription plan. Plans are available from 15 GB (free) to 30 TB (US$299.99 per month). Although users can create secure web albums, Google refuses to fix an error that started with their 'upgrade' to Google+: an Unlisted Gallery link does not display correctly unless the viewer is logged into a google account. Previously, users could share their Unlisted Gallery link with anyone, Google user or not. On February 12, 2016, Google announced that the Picasa desktop application would be discontinued on March 15, 2016, followed by the closure of the Picasa Web Albums service on May 1, 2016. Google stated that the primary reason for retiring Picasa was that it wanted to focus its efforts \\"entirely on a single photos service\\" the cross-platform, web-based Google Photos. While support for the desktop version of Picasa is ending, Google has stated that users who have downloaded the software, or who choose to download it prior to the March 15, 2016 deadline will still be able to use its functionality, albeit with no support from Google. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Picasa Web Albums Category:Google services Category:Image sharing websites ","title":"Picasa Web Albums"},{"id":"5566742","text":"Murray Ken Hudson, (24 February 1938 - 13 February 1974) was a Sergeant with the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment who lost his life when trying to protect soldiers under his command at Waiouru Military Camp in New Zealand.

Usually thin press moulded shapes are applied to greenware or bisque. The resulting pottery is termed sprigged ware, and the added piece is a \\"sprig\\". The technique may also be described by terms such as \\"applied relief decoration\\", especially in non-European pottery. The alternative way to achieve similar effects without sprigging is to mould the whole body, which is also common. P√¢te-sur-p√¢te is a very labour-intensive, and so expensive, method of producing similar, but more refined, effects in contrasting colors, invented in China and then in France in the mid-19th century. ==Technique== The clay body for the sprig is pushed into the mould, the back scraped flat, then released on a damp cloth pad. The greenware is wetted lightly with a brush, and the sprig is pressed lightly with another cloth pad to push out water and air. Slip may be used as an adhesive. ==History== Sprigging is used in ancient Roman pottery,Example in the British Museum and in China at least as early as the 6th century AD,Medley, Margaret, The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics, p. 71, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, continuing thereafter. It was not one of the main decorative techniques of Chinese ceramics, but for example was and is common on Yixing teapots. It is sometimes used on large celadon vases from the late Yuan dynasty or early Ming dynasty (14th century).Gompertz, G.St.G.M., Chinese Celadon Wares, p. 182 note 3, 1980 (2nd edn.), Faber & Faber, By at least the 9th century it was used in Islamic pottery.British Museum example In Europe, after the basic wares of the Middle Ages, use revived in fifteenth-century German salt-glazed stoneware, which was very widely exported around Europe. In Britain the first successful attempts to imitate both German wares and the Yixing teapots which were now being imported, mostly via the Netherlands, came around 1690. Whether John Dwight of the Fulham Pottery or the German-born Elers brothers were first is uncertain.Stoke-on-Trent Museum's \\"Key Dates in the English Pottery Industry\\" dates the first use of sprigging in Britain at 1693‚Äì1699 by the Elers brothers,, but Dwight pieces using it are often dated in the 1680s. See Poole, 36‚Äì38 They used metal moulds, which tend to leave a thin line impressed into the body around the outline of the sprig.Poole, Julia, English Pottery (Fitzwilliam Museum Handbooks), p. 36-38, 1995, Cambridge University Press, White Chinese Dehua porcelain cups and pots with sprigged prunus (plum/cherry) blossom decoration were copied by several European porcelain factories in the mid-18th century, from Meissen and S√®vres to Bow. Sprigging was used extensively in the Staffordshire potteries on a variety of wares and reached a height with Josiah Wedgwood's Jasperware, and his replica of the Portland Vase in 1790, which fully exploited the possibilities of contrasting colours of body and sprig.

Published in 2004, the novel contains elements of high fantasy. The novel focuses on a prophecy mentioned at the end of Gregor the Overlander which the Underlanders believe requires the protagonist Gregor to hunt down and kill an evil white rat known as the \\"Bane\\". It is told in third person. Several editions have been published, including standalone paperbacks and hardcovers and a paperback boxed set including all five books of the series. Listening Library published an audiobook version read by Paul Boehmer on April 11, 2006. The novel has also been released as an ebook, and is available from various online stores. Scholastic has rated its grade level equivalent as 5.3 and its lexile score as 680L, making it appropriate for the average 11-13 year-old. It has been praised as a sequel to the preceding novel and for showing the maturation of Gregor in the face of continually dark events. == Plot summary == Several months have passed since the events of the first novel, when Gregor and his baby sister Boots first fell into the subterranean city of Regalia (a part of the \\"Underland\\") and undertook a quest to save their father, who was being held prisoner by a group of Underland rats. The Underland humans supported the siblings' mission because they believed it was prophesied by their founder, Bartholomew of Sandwich. At the beginning of the second novel, the Underland humans kidnap Boots to force her and Gregor (whom they call the \\"Warrior\\") to participate in another of their prophecies. They interpret \\"The Prophecy of Bane\\" to mean that Gregor must kill a white rat (the \\"Bane\\") in order to prevent the humans' main enemies, the rats, from taking over. A set of lines about a dying baby \\"turn[ing] the Warrior weak\\" convince the humans that Boots is in danger, so Gregor sails off on an underground lake with only a few soldiers and their giant bats to hunt the Bane in the Labyrinth. During their journey, the questers are caught in a whirlpool, encounter an island of carnivorous insects, which results in Howard's bat, Pandora, being eaten alive, and are betrayed by the two shiners (fireflies) who were hired to provide them with light. Gregor himself begins to struggle with a new \\"power\\" that manifests when he is in battle. He is what the Underland creatures call a \\"rager\\", a person who is overcome by a kind of \\"battle-fury\\" when they fight, making them completely deadly even without training. Gregor and his bond Ares' worst trouble, however, is when they and the remaining questers become separated from the human queen Luxa, the cockroach Temp, and Boots during a fight with some serpents. The three missing are assumed dead, and Gregor finds himself emotionally frozen at the thought of having lost his baby sister. When he finally finds the Bane, he learns that it is not an adult monster, as was assumed, but instead a baby whose parents have just died. He can not bring himself to kill it, and so he and Ares take it to be raised by the only friendly rat they know: Ripred. After this, the two return to Regalia, where Nerissa has just been crowned queen. The surviving quest members - the bat Andromeda, human Howard, Ares, and Gregor - are tried for treason because they failed to kill the Bane. They are saved, though, by Nerissa, who controversially decrees it is good that Gregor was not heartless enough to kill a baby. Shortly thereafter, Gregor is trying to finally face the reality of going home without Boots when she is suddenly returned to the palace, having been saved in turn by Luxa, Temp, and an unnamed moth. The two then return to the surface world. ==Characters== Quest Members * Gregor: An eleven-year-old Overlander, said to be the warrior mentioned in \\"The Prophecy of Bane\\". * Boots (Margaret): Boots is Gregor's two-year-old sister. She is known as \\"the princess\\" by the crawlers (cockroaches). * Howard: Luxa's cousin, brought along for his skills in water aid. He is bonded to Pandora. * Mareth: A soldier and friend of Gregor, severely injured during the fight with the serpents. He is bonded to Andromeda. * Twitchtip: A gnawer (rat) Ripred sends along because of her incredible sense of smell; she is an outcast and \\"scent-seer\\". * Temp: A crawler and friend of Boots. He is lost during the battle with the serpents, then later loses a few legs while escaping some rats with Boots. He remains behind to regrow them while she is sent ahead. * Photos Glow-Glow and Zap: Two hired fireflies who desert the quest and inform the rats of the quest's approach when their pay (large quantities of food) runs out. * Ares: A large black flier (bat) bonded to Gregor. He is extremely strong, and similar to Gregor in many ways; the two become friends. * Pandora: Howard's bond, eaten alive by carnivorous mites. * Andromeda: Mareth's bond. * Aurora: Not technically part of the quest, Aurora is bonded to Luxa and accompanies her to join the quest after the boats carrying the members are too far from land for them to be sent home. She is lost and presumed dead after the battle with the serpents. * Luxa: The rebellious future queen of Regalia. She is not officially a quest member as she joins after they have already set out, and is lost with Aurora after the battle with the serpents. ==Publication== Scholastic has licensed rights to publish in 20 different languages. As of 2018, editions have been published in Italian, Turkish, German, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Finnish, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, French, Greek, Norwegian, Polish, Persian, and Chinese. Many foreign-language editions have titles different from the typical English translation, such as the Dutch Het Labyrint (\\"The Labyrinth\\") and Portuguese Gregor e a Segunda Profecia (\\"Gregor and the Second Prophecy\\"). The second United States English edition (), released in 2013 as part of a boxed set, has cover art by Vivienne To. New United Kingdom editions, published in 2013 () and 2016 (), respectively, have different cover art. The novel has also been released in ebook and audiobook form. Multiple editions have been published in most languages; for example, audiobooks, paperbacks, and hardcovers have been published in English, German, and Spanish. The English audiobook published April 11, 2006 is read by actor Paul Boehmer. The book's lexile score is 680L, making it appropriate for child readers in the 4th-6th grades. Scholastic, the book's publisher, recommends the novel for children in grades 3-8. ==Reception== Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane received critical acclaim, especially for its treatment of difficult issues in a way that is accessible for young readers. VOYA reviewer Nancy K. Wallace notes the discussions of revenge, murder, and betrayal. She remarks on how Gregor is \\"prepared to heartlessly slaughter The Bane\\" yet overcomes his \\"hatred for the rats that killed his sister\\", but must still \\"face charges of treason\\" for his apparent betrayal of his duties. Timnah Card of the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books describes how Gregor is \\"disturbed to discover his unsuspected capacities as a warrior\\". In a similar way, the book's Kirkus Reviews review notes the way that \\"humor and terror alternate\\" throughout the story. The Children's Cooperative Book Center (CCBC) of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison wrote \\"Scenes...range from fast to funny to deliciously frightening. Gregor also faces several moral choices. As in the first volume of The Underland Chronicles, there is plenty of humor and plenty of intense action in this riveting, fast-paced novel.\\" More generally, School Library Journal said, \\"This is a strong choice for fantasy fans, including reluctant readers, even if they're not familiar with Gregor's first adventure.\\" Kathy L. Fiedler of the Kutztown University Book Review called the novel \\"a hit with young readers, especially those who've enjoyed The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau\\". Several critics, including Publishers Weekly, lauded the novel specifically as a sequel to the well-received Gregor the Overlander. Wallace calls Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane a \\"welcome sequel\\", going on to state that \\"on the last page, the scene is skillfully set for [further sequels]\\". The Horn Book Magazine similarly stated, \\"Gregor‚Äôs fans will cheer the promise of future visits.\\" On a more negative note, Peg Glisson writes for Children's Literature that \\"those who have not read the first Gregor will be at a slight disadvantage. Collins tries to weave necessary details from Gregor's first visit to the Underworld into this one, but it definitely slows the early chapters down and is not completely satisfying.\\" Ed Sullivan of Booklist claims \\"...fans will not be disappointed with this exciting, action-packed sequel\\", although he also warns \\"readers unfamiliar with the first novel will be at a disadvantage [as] Collins assumes knowledge of the characters and developments from the first book\\". The CCBC also praised the book for its portrayal of strong and healthy sibling relationships as it \\"[continued] the saga of two contemporary siblings navigating their way through unfamiliar territory\\". Card says, \\"Gregor's parents' inability to care for their children after the return of his father in the first book sets the stage for this second journey, in which the counsel of adults is well meant but morally ambiguous and Gregor's own wisdom must carry the day. That continuing realism wraps the mile-a-minute adventure in a satisfyingly complex political and social network and provides the whole with a compelling emotional foundation. Throughout, the motivations and growth of individual characters drive the action...\\" Glisson writes as well of how Gregor has \\"matured since his last adventure\\" and \\"learns to deal with the fact that he is a \\"rager,\\" a deadly and efficient fighter.\\" Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane was on the New York Times and Book Sense Bestseller lists. It was also a Book Sense Children's Pick for 2005. The book has received several other awards as well. In 2005, it was a Connecticut Book Award Finalist and a Cooperative Children's Book Center recommended book. In 2007, it was nominated for the Sequoyah Children's Book Award, but did not win. ==Notes References External links== *ISFDB *WorldCat Category:2004 American novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:American children's novels Category:Novels set in New York (state) Category:The Underland Chronicles Category:2004 children's books Category:Sequel novels Category:Novels set on ships ","title":"Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane"},{"id":"5566817","text":"Motorcycle club members wearing cut-offs bearing various patches Biker's vintage cut-off adorned with club badgesA cut-off, battle jacket, battle vest or kutte in heavy metal subcultures, is a type of vest or jacket which originated in the biker subculture and later found popularity in punk and various heavy metal subcultures. Biker, metal and punk subcultures differ in how the garment is prepared, what decorations are applied, and how this is done. Cut-offs are usually made from leather or denim jackets with their sleeves removed, or cut very short, and often adorned with patches, badges and painted artwork that display motorcycle club affiliations known as colours, or alternatively band names, political affiliations, beliefs, or sexual acts performed. In the 1970s and 1980s, cut-offs were almost always blue denim. Thrash metal fans favoured heavily washed denim, while members of one British motorcycle club bleached theirs until they were almost white. From the mid to late 1990s, some punks and metalheads have worn multi-pocketed hunting or fishing vests, both in plain colours and camouflage patterns, and leather cut- offs‚Äîalways popular with punks, and with bikers in recent decades.Punk vests are often made from leather and heavily decorated with metal studs ==Punk and hardcore== In punk subculture, cut-offs are often leather (but can also be denim). Typical decorations are metal studs and badges (often painted-on) of bands or political causes, with cloth patches being secondary, ultimately because of the difficulty of doing the required needlework on tough leather. In addition, sleeves are more likely to be kept attached to the body of the jacket. As part of the DIY philosophy of the hardcore punk scene, the vests may be home-repaired with heavy thread, dental floss, or safety pins, and the band logos may be put on using paint and crude home-made stencils. Some wearers also drape chains or other paraphernalia from the vest. Heavy metal/hard rock fans with vests ==Heavy metal== Cut-offs in the heavy metal scene are often adorned with patches of logos and album covers of bands, ranging in size from small square patches to large patches that fill the back panel of the vest. Patches are the main decoration. However, some Heavy Metal kutten have studs on them, particularly for fans of crossover thrash bands such as mid-1980s Discharge or of thrash metal. ==References== Category:Jackets Category:1970s fashion Category:1980s fashion Category:Punk fashion Category:Heavy metal fashion Category:Motorcycling subculture ","title":"Cut-off"},{"id":"5566826","text":"The sfumatura or slow-folding process is a traditional technique for manually extracting the essential oils from citrus peel using sponges.

It is the third book in The Underland Chronicles, and was first published by Scholastic in 2005. The novel takes place a few months after the events of the preceding book, in the same subterranean world known as the Underland. In this installment, the young protagonist Gregor is once again recruited by the Underland's inhabitants, this time to help cure a rapidly-spreading plague. Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods has been published as stand-alone hardcovers and paperbacks, as well as part of a boxed set. It was released as an audiobook on December 13, 2005, read by Paul Boehmer. In August 2010, it was released in ebook form. It has been lauded for \\"[addressing] a number of political issues ... in a manner accessible to upper elementary and middle school readers\\". ==Development== The Underland Chronicles was first conceived by author Suzanne Collins while working as a television screenwriter for Generation O!. She was encouraged by colleague James Proimos to begin writing children's books, and started the manuscript of Gregor the Overlander shortly thereafter. Proimos also recommended her to his literary agent, Rosemary Stimola. Upon seeing a sample of that first book, Stimola immediately agreed to represent Collins and sent the book's manuscript to Scholastic. Stimola represented Collins throughout the publication of each book in the series, including Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods, and helped to bolster Collins's confidence during the \\"Harry wave\\" ‚Äì her name for the \\"skewed publisher expectations about what constitutes a success\\" that resulted from the publication of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. After the publication of Gregor the Overlander in 2003, Collins moved with her family to rural Connecticut. There she focused more on her writing than her other pursuits, and published five books in four years, including the rest of The Underland Chronicles. Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods was written at around the same time as her first picture book, When Charlie McButton Lost Power. During this time period, Collins continued writing for children's TV, describing her scripts as \\"an excellent mental break ... because no one dies in [them]\\". Collins has listed two main sources of influence in her writing of The Underland Chronicles. First is her M.F.A. in dramatic writing and her experience as a screenwriter. This writing experience resulted in her structuring books \\"like a three-act play\\", and paying close attention to the plot's pacing. Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods came third in \\"a series of narratives that are interrelated yet can stand on their own\\", a fact not missed by reviewers. Collins' other source of inspiration was her father Michael Collins, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force, who provided her with advice about the war tactics used in her books, and also instilled in her an \\"impulse to educate young people about the realities of war\\". Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods has a lexile score of 710L. Scholastic has rated its \\" grade level equivalent\\" as 5.3, making its themes, style, and vocabulary appropriate for the average fifth grader. Booklist reviews of the novel recommend it for children in grades 4‚Äì6. Two separate reviews from the School Library Journal classify the novel as for slightly higher grades: grades 4‚Äì7 and 5‚Äì8, respectively. ==Plot summary== Despite the difficulties it has caused for his family, Gregor finds it hard to distance himself from the Underland. When he receives word that a plague has broken out and his bond Ares is one of the victims, he heads down to help with yet another of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies. His mother, however, hates the Underland and only allows Boots and Gregor below on the condition that she comes with them. The humans' plague expert, Dr. Neveeve, explains that there is a plant called starshade growing deep in the Vineyard of Eyes which can be distilled into a cure. In the midst of the meeting, a dying bat infected with the plague inadvertently infects one of the delegates‚ÄîGregor's mother. Gregor immediately joins a group of creatures on a quest to find the starshade, as described in \\"The Prophecy of Blood\\". The current queen, Nerissa, has arranged Hamnet - the estranged, pacifistic son of Solovet and Vikus - as their guide. Hamnet, his Halflander son Hazard, and their hisser companion Frill lead the motley crew through the dangerous Jungle and numerous setbacks. During a near- death experience with a pool of quicksand, the group encounters Luxa, the heir apparent of Regalia who was assumed to be dead after the quest in Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane. She and her bond Aurora were trapped in the Jungle when Aurora dislocated her wing, and have been living there with a colony of nibblers (mice). After Hamnet fixes Aurora's wing, the bonds accompany the questers. They arrive at the Vineyard of Eyes, but an army of cutters (ants, who would like to see all warm-blooded creatures gone) destroys the starshade and kill both Hamnet and Frill. The group's hopes are crushed until they realize a new possibility: that the plague was developed by the humans as a biological agent to be used against the rats. The group hastens home, and find their theory proved correct by the humans' new medication, developed without the supposed \\"cradle cure\\". Luxa furiously exposes the covert military project. Dr. Neveeve is executed for her participation and Solovet, the project's head, is imprisoned in preparation for a trial. Following up on a promise to Ripred, Luxa sends doses of the cure to the gnawers while the Regalian hospital treats as many human and bat victims as possible. Though she is healing, Gregor's mother is too weak to go home, and so the book ends with Gregor confiding his problems to his neighbor Mrs. Cormaci. The Prophecy of Blood The \\"Prophecy of Blood\\" is unusual in two ways: it is the first of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies to feature a repeating \\"refrain\\"; and it is carved backwards in a tight corner of the prophecy room, so that a mirror is required to read it. Nerissa tells Gregor she believes Sandwich purposely made it \\"difficult to read\\" in order to emphasize how difficult it is to understand, and Gregor later hypothesizes that Sandwich forced the humans to read it using mirrors so that, as a person read, \\"[they] would see [themselves]\\". Ripred similarly points out that an \\"annoying little dance\\" Boots makes up to go along with the prophecy's refrain echoes this theme, by forcing the questers to turn and see themselves before they realize that the plague originated with the humans. Boots's \\"help\\" deciphering this prophecy leads characters to rely on her to do the same in the series's later books. In Gregor and the Marks of Secret, Boots begins dancing to a song Sandwich carved \\"in the nursery, not the room of prophecies\\" after the characters witness the mass execution of a group of nibblers and becomes \\"totally convinced\\" that the song is actually yet another prophecy. In Gregor and the Code of Claw, when the \\"Prophecy of Time\\" calls for a \\"princess\\" to crack a cryptogram, Boots is immediately assigned the role because of her importance to the last two prophecies, despite the fact that she is still a toddler. The repeating refrain goes as follows: Turn and turn and turn again. You see the what but not the when. Remedy and wrong entwine, And so they form a single vine. Gregor hypothesizes that Sandwich included a cryptic repeating segment in the prophecy to drum the meaning of these lines into the heads of his readers, or to emphasize their importance. The prophecy's other stanzas describe the plague and who it affects, call for the warrior's return, explain how to find the cure and win allies amongst the nonhuman species, and warn strongly against allowing a war to start in the Underland. Gregor refers to this final point as \\"Sandwich's usual prediction that if things didn't work out, there would be total destruction and everybody would end up dead.\\" As with other prophecies in The Underland Chronicles, its meaning \\"only becomes clear in the later stages of the book\\". ==Characters== Quest members * Gregor: A young Overlander and \\"rager\\", said to be the warrior mentioned in \\"The Prophecy of Gray\\". * Boots (Margaret): Boots is Gregor's toddler sister. She is called the \\"princess\\" by the crawlers, and has a knack for recognizing different insects. * Hamnet: A former soldier and son of Solovet and Vikus, who leads the questers through the Jungle until his death. * Hazard: The child of Hamnet and an unnamed Overlander woman. Hazard is gifted with languages. * Ripred: A gnawer (rat) and rager like Gregor. * Mange and Lapblood: A male and female rat, respectively, who are trying to save their pups from the plague. Mange is eaten by a carnivorous plant, and his death deeply upsets Lapblood. * Temp: The crawlers' representative on the quest. He is endlessly patient and brave, especially with his \\"princess\\". He also has an uncanny knack to recognize danger before other questers, though his warnings are often ignored. * Frill: A hisser who has been living with Hamnet and Hazard. She dies fighting the cutters. * Nike: A black and white flier (bat) who helps Gregor while Ares is incapacitated. She is the daughter of the fliers' queen, and has a permanently optimistic disposition. * Luxa and Aurora: Two unofficial members of the quest who join the group after learning of the plague. The two were trapped in the Jungle in Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane when Aurora's wing is dislocated. ==Publication== The book was originally released as an individual hardcover in 2005, then as a paperback in July 2006. In 2013, a new edition of the novel was published as part of a paperback boxed set of the five books in The Underland Chronicles, featuring new cover art by Vivienne To. Other sets have been released by Scholastic as well. The first was in the US on September 1, 2009, and a second on August 1, 2013 in the UK, again with new art. Random House Audio released an audiobook version in December 2005. It was read by actor and narrator Paul Boehmer. A School Library Journal review praised Boehmer's \\"distinct voice\\" for each character and called the edition a \\"good purchase for both school and public libraries\\". A Booklist review also lauded Boehmer for \\"keeping his narrative pace even, [helping] listeners keep the complex story straight\\". The book's first ebook version was released in August 2010. Since its first printing in 2005, a number of alternate editions have been produced. Scholastic has signed rights to publishers working in a total of 19 different languages. , editions have appeared in German, French, Chinese, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, Italian, Finnish, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish. Multiple editions with unique cover art have been published for most of these languages. Scholastic advertised the second English edition, released exactly one year after the first, as having \\"fresh new cover art\\" by August Hall. ==Reception== Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods has been positively reviewed by professional and amateur critics alike. Many reviews focus on the book particularly as a sequel to the first two of the series. In the words of Tasha Saecker of School Library Journal, for example, \\"Collins maintains the momentum, charm, and vivid settings of the original title.\\" The Horn Book Magazine review went further, saying that \\"This immensely readable installment won't disappoint fans of the first two books. In fact, Collins seems to have hit her stride with this page-turner.\\" Kirkus mentioned the novel's more serious plot and themes with the review's comment, \\"This offering takes on an even darker tone than the earlier ones, delving into meaty questions of territorial expansion and its justification.\\" A review in the Library Media Connection, on the other hand, said that \\"Collins's subtle messages about the horrors of war and the benefits of peace\\" make the book \\"worthy of discussion\\" by readers of all ages. Collins herself has said that she would \\"like to take topics like war and introduce them at an earlier age. If you look at 'Gregor', it has all kinds of topics. There's biological warfare, there's genocide, there's military intelligence. But it's in a fantasy.\\" Collins has also stated that she approaches her books the same way her father approached explaining his military service to her as a child: at a level understandable to children, but not without the honest descriptions needed to show the true gravity of the situation. A review published in The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books makes the claim that Gregor's \\"evolution from a scared, unwilling combatant in the first book to a morally responsible, talented warrior ... here ... makes his character realistic and appealing\\", and thus that the increased violence in Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods is a necessary part of his character development. Reviews published in Library Media Connection and VOYA also praise the novel's more serious nature as providing better insight into the politics of the Underland. The novel was a New York Times bestseller and a Book Sense bestseller and Top-Ten Children's pick. It was awarded an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Award in 2006. ==References== Category:American fantasy novels Category:2005 American novels Category:The Underland Chronicles Category:American children's novels Category:Novels set in New York (state) Category:Biological weapons in popular culture Category:2005 children's books Category:Sequel novels ","title":"Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods"},{"id":"5566832","text":"Anne Mather Smith, Lady Smith, (born 16 March 1955) is a Scottish lawyer, and a judge of the Supreme Courts of Scotland. ==Early life== Anne Mather was educated at Jordanhill School and Cheadle County Grammar School for Girls, before attending the School of Law of the University of Edinburgh, where she graduated with an LL.B.

It picks up soon after the end of Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods. ==Plot summary== The novel opens with Gregor's little sister Lizzie preparing to go to camp, while Gregor and Boots head down to the Underland. Ripred introduces Gregor to the now-teenaged Pearlpelt so Gregor can observe \\"the Bane's\\" violent instability, and choose to kill him before he ends up in a leadership position. Gregor is uncomfortable with the idea. The next day, he returns to dissuade Ripred, but is instead attacked by the Bane's friends. After several more weeks, Ripred is still missing, but Gregor remains relaxed until a messenger unexpectedly delivers Luxa her crown. Luxa and her friends know that this is a distress call from the nibbler colony in the Jungle. They investigate, but discover only a deceased mouse and an abandoned colony. Luxa is distraught, and decides to visit the nibblers' other colony at the Fount, under the pretense of going on a picnic date. This ruse leads to several others coming along as well. The group finds the colony mysteriously deserted, though they do discover a \\"mark of secret\\" which Hazard says warns of death and sorrow. The traveling party tracks the mice into the Swag, but are forced into Hades Hall by an earthquake. During their journey back to Regalia, they learn the Bane has been systematically executing nibblers, which leads Luxa to declare war against all gnawers. Gregor becomes annoyed with Luxa as the consequences of her actions become apparent. The team eventually locates the missing nibblers, trapped by rats in a natural gas chamber, and is shocked to discover an Underland children's song describes the scene perfectly (and is thus yet another of Bartholomew of Sandwich's dreadful prophecies). A volcano starts to erupt nearby, and all rush to escape. Though one of their number dies in the explosion, the group travels sadly on until they exit the Firelands. Once there, they part ways: Gregor, Ares, and Temp going to escort the young and injured back to Regalia and spread the news of the rats' plans; the rest returning to protect and mobilize any remaining nibblers. Gregor wants to join the latter group, but Ripred convinces him to go learn about the \\"Prophecy of Time\\" and finally claim Sandwich's sword. Ripred also helps Gregor realize his new romantic feelings for Luxa, which have kept him moody and confused during their entire journey. The novel ends with Gregor accepting his role as Sandwich's \\"warrior\\" by claiming the man's sword. The Prophecy of Secret The prophecy in this book is carved into the walls of an old nursery in the Regalian Palace. The Underlanders take it for a popular nursery rhyme of sorts, like Hey Diddle Diddle or Humpty Dumpty. Underland children sing and dance to it at parties, as Gregor discovers in the early chapters of the novel. The song's \\"true\\" meaning is unknown until the mass death of a group of nibblers, when Boots's dancing mimics the terrifying scene perfectly. It was dubbed the \\"Prophecy of Secret\\" by Aurora. Dancing in the firelight, See the queen who conquers night. Gold flows from her, hot and bright. Meaning: During this part of the children's song, dancers select one girl to be \\"the queen\\" and dance in the center of their circle. When the quest members assign it a different meaning, they decide this verse talks about a large volcano, and the light it gives off in the dark tunnels. Father, mother, sister, brother, Off they go I do not know If we will see another Meaning: This section is repeated at the end of every verse, and refers to the fact that entire families of nibblers are being executed by the gnawers. As the rats hope to exterminate the mice once and for all, it is truly unlikely that anyone will ever \\"see another\\" Catch the nibblers in a trap. Watch the nibblers spin and snap. Quiet while they take a nap. Meaning: The nibblers are being herded into a pit at the base of the volcano, which is spewing some form of asphyxiant or toxic gas. As the gas (which is denser than air) is blown towards the mice by the currents, it settles into the pit and is breathed in by the nibblers. They start to writhe on the ground in search of clean air, and finally grow still as they are suffocated and die. The mice appear to be napping (according to Boots), which is one of the first clues that leads the quest group to reinterpret this children's song. Now the guests are at our door Greet them as we have before. Some will slice and some will pour. Meaning: The final verse was once taken as a description of a tea party, and was accompanied by dance moves miming slicing cake and pouring tea. Once the quest groups \\"translate\\" the lines, they are taken to describe the war with the gnawers that Luxa has recently initiated. The Regalians are fully prepared to resume hostilities \\"as [they] have before\\". Luxa explains to Gregor that, in times of war, the Regalians attack their enemies with swords and burning oil poured from high places. ==Characters== Quest members * Gregor: The twelve-year-old protagonist of the novel; a \\"rager\\" and the Regalians' \\"warrior\\". He is bonded to the flier Ares and is a close friend of the princess Luxa. The knowledge that he will soon be leaving the Underland forever causes him to conflict with many of his friends, when they act as though he will never leave. * Ares: A large black flier (bat) bonded to Gregor. He is brave and much stronger than the average bat. During the journey, he is a source of strength for the other quest members with his calm and resourcefulness. * Luxa: The rebellious future queen of Regalia. During the period between Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane and Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods, she and her bond Aurora were trapped in the Jungle and became close friends with the nibbler colony there. It is that colony's request for help that motivated her, Aurora, Gregor, and Ares to begin their quest. She later makes the \\"Vow to the Dead\\" at the site of a nibbler mass execution, essentially pledging all her personal and political power to avenge the mice's deaths. * Aurora: A golden bat bonded to Luxa. She is one of Ares's only friends. She tends to side with Luxa in arguments, particularly on the subject of the mice colonies, as they were great friends to her as well. * Boots (Margaret): Boots is Gregor's two-year- old sister. She is known as \\"the princess\\" by the crawlers. She becomes fixated with an Underland children's song that is later determined to be one of Bartholomew of Sandwich's sinister prophecies in disguise. * Hazard: Luxa's young halflander cousin. He gifted with languages, and also has unusual knowledge about life in the Jungle, which makes him a great asset to the quest group. He turns seven early in the novel. He and the young flier Thalia are very close friends. Hazard sustains a head wound immediately after the traveling party enters the Swag and is incapacitated for most of the trip. * Thalia: A very young peach-colored female bat. She absolutely loves jokes, and the other quest members often try to get her to laugh when she is terrifies by the number of dangerous circumstances they encounter on their way back to Regalia. She dies in the eruption of \\"the Queen\\" volcano, because she is too slow to outfly the volcanic ash and too inexperienced to hold her breath while flying. Ares, who blames himself for being unable to carry her away fast enough, lays her to rest with some mice recently executed by rats. * Howard: Luxa's capable older cousin, and a kind of older brother to her. Howard is training to become a doctor, and is remarkably tolerant towards other creatures, with the notable exception of shiners (whom he blames for the near- death of Luxa and Aurora). * Nike: A black-and-white striped bat, the daughter of Queen Athena. She becomes close to Howard, who lost his bond Pandora during a previous quest. Like Howard, she also dislikes fireflies. * Temp: A crawler and friend of Boots. He is not very good at speaking English (which leads many to look down on him somewhat), but he is patient and wise, and has finely tuned natural instincts which save the quest members several times. * Ripred: A grizzled old rat, and a rager like Gregor. The questers find him trapped in a slick obsidian pit with his teeth locked together, a form of slow execution and torture ordered by the Bane. He journeys with them out of the Firelands and provides valuable insight into the gnawers' reasons for exterminating the nibblers. * Cartesian: A nibbler from the Fount colony whom the questers encounter early on. He is the sole survivor of his colony and is both terribly injured and suffering from an acute stress reaction (or \\"shock\\"). During brief moments of lucidity, he reveals himself to be brave and intelligent, but he spends most of the trip delirious from pain medication. * Photos Glow-Glow and Zap: Two hired fireflies who travel briefly with the quest members as a source of light, after their displaced colony is discovered in Hades Hall. They desert the group at the first sign of danger. ==References== Category:2006 American novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Novels set in New York (state) Category:The Underland Chronicles Category:2006 children's books Category:American children's novels Category:Genocide in fiction ","title":"Gregor and the Marks of Secret"},{"id":"5566855","text":"Frederick Augustus Dixey, FRS (9 December 1855 ‚Äì 16 January 1935) was president of the Royal Entomological Society of London, and was a distinguished British entomologist.

The screenplay by Tom Musca, Ram√≥n Men√©ndez and Vera Blasi is based on the film Eat Drink Man Woman, which was written by Hui-Ling Wang, Ang Lee, and James Schamus. ==Plot== Semi-retired Mexican-American chef Martin Naranjo shares a suburban Los Angeles home with his three adult daughters. Although he has lost the senses of smell and taste since his wife's death, he still cooks elaborate, multi-course meals for his family and friends. The women humor their father's old-fashioned ways, but each is searching for fulfillment outside the family circle. Leticia, the oldest and most conservative of the three, is a repressed high school chemistry teacher who abandoned Catholicism to become a born-again Christian. Middle daughter Carmen shares her father's passion for food but has stifled her dream of owning a restaurant in favor of pursuing a more stable career as a business analyst. Maribel, the youngest, is hip and slightly rebellious. Frequently present in the Naranjo home are newly divorced family friend Yolanda, her young daughter April, and her visiting mother Hortensia, who has set her sights on Martin and is determined to make him her next husband, unaware his attention is focused on someone else. Maribel is drawn to handsome Brazilian student Andy after her co-worker rejects him and, after they briefly date, she invites him home for dinner, during which she blithely announces she is moving in with him, much to her father's consternation and Andy's shock, since they never had discussed elevating their somewhat casual relationship to this next level. Before long she is rearranging his small apartment and unintentionally making him increasingly uncomfortable as she imposes herself in his life. Meanwhile, Leticia finds herself attracted to Orlando Castillo, who coaches baseball at her school, when she begins to receive passionate love letters she believes are from him, unaware they actually were written by her students. Carmen is offered a high-profile job in Barcelona, and half-heartedly agrees to accept it, although soon after her father drives her to the airport she returns home, determined to follow in her father's footsteps and open a restaurant of her own. Leticia and Orlando elope, Maribel and Andy break up and reunite, Martin marries Yolanda, and everyone gathers for a family meal at Carmen's new restaurant. ==CastProduction== The film was shot on location in El Segundo, California, USA and Los Angeles, California, USA The meals featured in the film were prepared by celebrity chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger who, as hosts of the Food Network program Too Hot Tamales, introduced viewers to their contemporary take on traditional Mexican cuisine. The Production Design was by the Argentine designer Alicia Maccarone. The film's soundtrack includes \\"Sem conten√ß√£o\\" by Bebel Gilberto, \\"Cuchi-Cuchi\\" and \\"Si estuvieras aqu√≠\\" by Los Amigos Invisibles, \\"A bailar\\" by Patricio Castillo, \\"Si en un final\\" by Eliades Ochoa, \\"Call Waiting\\" by Zap Mama, \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\\" by Lila Downs, \\"Les Portes Du Souvenir\\" by Les Nubians, and \\"Amado m√≠o\\" by Pink Martini. ==Critical response== The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 74% based on reviews from 72 critics, with an average rating of 6.38/10. The consensus reads, \\"An English remake of Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman, Tortilla Soup is as charming and flavorful as the dishes it features.\\" Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times called the film \\"forgettable\\" and \\"as predictable as a fast-food restaurant.\\" Although he thought it \\"has more warm, likable actors and agile performances than this material merits,\\" he felt their \\"exuberance goes a long way, but not far enough.\\"The New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"a warm human comedy that has no great deep message but simply makes us feel good\\" and added, \\"Tortilla Soup follows a familiar formula, in which the movie opens with everyone unmarried and we suspect it will have to end with everyone happily paired-off. But the movie is cast so well that the actors bring life to their predictable destinies, and Elizondo casts a kind of magical warm spell over them all.\\" Ken Eisner of Variety called the film a \\"warm-blooded winner with equal emphasis placed on taste buds and heartstrings\\" and continued, \\"Easy to swallow is the decision to completely avoid issues of ethnic and economic conflict, making this genuine crowd-pleaser an utterly gang-and-drug-free look at Hispanic subculture. And it's one that all families can relate to - especially at dinnertime. ==Awards and nominations== Elizabeth Pe√±a tied with Elpidia Carrillo in Bread and Roses for the ALMA Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, and the film tied with Bread and Roses for the Imagen Foundation Award for Best Feature Film. ==Home media== The film was released on DVD on January 15, 2002.

As of 2018, she was the last filly to win this title. ==Background== Georgia E. Hofmann, who owned Wycombe House Stud, bought Sky Beauty for $355,000 at the 1991 Saratoga yearling sale from her breeders, Howard and Susan Kaskel of Sugar Maple Farm. The acquisition served as a sort of homecoming because Hofmann and her late husband, Philip, had bred Sky Beauty's dam, Maplejinsky (by Nijinsky II). Maplejinsky was sold to the Kaskels for $750,000 and was then trained by Philip G. Johnson. She scored her biggest win in the 1988 Alabama Stakes for Susan Kaskel. When she was bred to Blushing Groom (a French stallion by Red God out of Runaway Bride), Maplejinsky produced Sky Beauty. The Hofmanns, who bought the daughter of the filly they had sold to the Kaskels, also bred and raced Maplejinsky's dam, homebred Gold Beauty, the 1982 winner of the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Sprint Horse. ==Triple Tiara== Now owned by the breeders of her dam and her grand-dam, Sky Beauty was trained by the \\"Giant Killer,\\" H. Allen Jerkens. As a 2-year-old, she won the Grade I Matron Stakes and the Grade II Adirondack Stakes. She finished first in the Grade I Spinaway Stakes but was disqualified and placed third. In 1993-94, the filly dominated the New York distaff scene as a 3- and 4-year-old. She won 10 graded stakes races, eight of which were Grade I events. She took the three Grade I races that made up the former Triple Tiara--the Acorn Stakes and Mother Goose Stakes and the Coaching Club American Oaks. Additionally, she won the Grade I Alabama Stakes and the Grade II Rare Perfume Stakes. Sky Beauty seemed destined for a 3-year- old championship but lost out to Hollywood Wildcat after that filly won the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Santa Anita Racetrack. At age four, Sky Beauty won the Go For Wand Handicap, Ruffian Handicap, Shuvee Handicap, and Hempstead Handicap (all Grade I races) plus the Grade III Vagrancy Handicap. She failed to live up to expectations in the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill Downs, running unplaced, but accomplished enough to be voted the 1994 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse. At five, she again won the Vagrancy, and she placed in the Shuvee. ==As a broodmare== Sky Beauty was retired in 1995 with a record of 15 wins and earnings of $1,336,000. She produced her first three foals for Georgia Hofmann. Then, through Taylor Made Farms, she was sold (in foal to Gone West) for $2,850,000 to John Magnier of Coolmore Stud at the 1999 Keeneland November breeding stock sale. Sky Beauty produced five named foals, three of which were winners. Her two youngest offspring, a yearling and a weanling, are unnamed colts by Storm Cat. Three of Sky Beauty's offspring fetched high prices, with two yearlings selling for $1.2 million and $500,000, and a weanling selling for $800,000. Sky Beauty was euthanized at age fourteen on July 2, 2004, at Creekview Farm near Paris, Kentucky, due to complications from laminitis. She initially suffered from founder after delivering her seventh foal (a colt by leading sire Storm Cat) on May 28. Dermot Ryan, manager at Coolmore's Ashford Stud near Versailles, Kentucky, confirmed Sky Beauty's death on July 2, 2004. Several times, Sky Beauty was nominated to the Racing Hall of Fame, including in the year of her death. She was elected in 2011.

It is the first of the four exegetical methods known together as PaRDeS. While Peshat is commonly defined as referring to the surface or literal (direct) meaning of a text,Goldin, S. (2007). Unlocking the Torah Text: Bereishit. Gefen Publishing. numerous scholars and rabbis have debated this for centuries, giving Peshat many uses and definitions.Garfinkel, Stephen. \\"Clearing Peshat and Derash.\\" Hebrew Bible/Old Testament - The History of Its Interpretation. Comp. Chris Brekelmans and Menahem Haran. Ed. Magne S√¶b√∏. G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2000. 130-34. Print. == Definitions == Peshat, among the four methods which make up Pardes, is most often defined as \\"straight,\\" in reference to its tendency to describe the meaning of the text apparent at face value, taking into account idiomatic expressions, and focusing mostly on literal interpretation. It is often considered the most straightforward method for reading and understanding of biblical text. In this way, Peshat differentiates itself from the other methods present in Pardes - Remez, Drash and Sod, which look at what may be hidden in the text. Linguistically, the term Peshat finds its root in the Biblical Hebrew term meaning \\"to flatten out,\\" or \\"to extend.\\"Rabinowitz, Louis Isaac. \\"Peshat.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 16. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 8-9. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 5 Nov. 2010 In the Talmudic Era, this definition was expanded to mean \\"to propound.\\"Rabinowitz, Louis. \\"The Talmudic Meaning of Peshat.\\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought 6.1 (1963). Web. Often when defining Peshat, a quote from the Shabbat tractate of Talmud is referenced, stating \\"◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊û◊ß◊®◊ê ◊ô◊ï◊¶◊ê ◊û◊ô◊ì◊ô ◊§◊©◊ï◊ò◊ï,\\" or, \\"a text cannot be taken from the meaning of its peshat.\\" Some have used the Talmudic definition of Peshat to widen its overall definition, stating that the Peshat interpretation of a particular passage is \\"the teaching recognized by the public as obviously authoritative, since familiar and traditional,\\" or \\"the usual accepted traditional meaning as it was generally taught.\\" Based on the definitions provided by Talmud, it may be inferred that Peshat is solely a literal exegetical method. Others, though, have attributed this line of thought to the work of Rashi, and that he strictly defined Peshat and Drash years later - often his definitions have been used to redact the meaning of Peshat within its Talmudic usage. Another linguistic curiosity can be seen in the difference between Peshat and the Hebrew verb Lamad (◊ú◊û◊ì), meaning \\"to study.\\" Peshat can be interpreted to mean a thorough and intensive learning of a text, rather than just a surface reading signified by Lamad. In this understanding of Peshat, the idea that it is only the literal meaning of a text is incorrect. Rather, Peshat would refer to what can be extracted from intensive study, while still maintaining the importance of the literal meaning of the text. Therefore, a slightly different definition of Peshat can be formed, specifically that Peshat should refer to the meaning of a text as was commonly taught and accepted, including, but not limited to, a literal interpretation.Angel, Rabbi Hayyim. \\"From Black Fire to White Fire: Conversations about Religious Tanakh Methodology.\\" The Institute for Jewish Ideas and Ideals. 4 Sept. 2008. Web. Definitions of Peshat also note the importance of context, both historical and literary. This is in contrast to Drash, which will often take the text of a verse out of its context, for uses beyond the context such as ritual or moral purposes. However, this does not mean that Peshat and Drash are fully opposing methods. In fact, one may often be used in helping to explain the other, in finding and defining nuances in text that might be otherwise inexplicable without application of both methods. == Rabbinic views and usage == Abraham Ibn Ezra is quoted in his writings as saying that the Rabbis of the Talmud were well-versed in Peshat, having built their Midrashic exegeses on it: \\"They [the talmudic rabbis] knew peshat better than all the generations that came after them.\\"Lockshin, Martin I. \\"Lonely Man of Peshat.\\" Jewish Quarterly Review 99.2 (2009): 291-300. Print. In contrast, Rashbam, felt that the early rabbis were not knowledgeable in Peshat, and instead used other strategies. Consequently, these rabbis were led to opposing conclusions of the rabbis' halachic exegesis: Rashbam understood this as a separate type of exegesis from Peshat, while Ibn Ezra felt that the only proper exegesis would lead to his own conclusions, and therefore disregarded the midrashim of the Talmudic Rabbis as exegesis altogether. Regardless of these differences in opinion in reference to the Rabbis of the Talmud, both Ibn Ezra and Rashbam favored and promoted Peshat as a superior alternative to Midrashic methods. One of Rashbam's students, Rabbi Eliezer of Beaugency, is noted as completely removing Drash from his exegetical strategies, relying solely on Peshat. In comparison to Rashbam's tendency to explain how his views would contrast with those of Talmudic Rabbis, Rabbi Eliezer is not compelled to do so, feeling that Peshat is the only proper way to look at text.Berger, Yitzhak. \\"The Contextual Exegesis of Rabbi Eliezer of Beaugency and the Climax of the Northern French Peshat Tradition.\\" Jewish Studies Quarterly 15.2 (2008): 115-29. Print. As Peshat's methods rely often on the importance of context, Rabbi Eliezer's commentaries are known for their tendency to focus on the context of a given verse or text. His commentaries are integrated with text, rather than sitting separate from them, and he insists on ensuring that no verse loses its context during his discussions, in comparison to other methods, such as the \\"verse-by-verse approach of Rashi\\" David Kimhi (Radak) was also known for his ability in Peshat, and was influenced both by Ibn Ezra and Rashi. While Kimhi preferred Peshat methods over Derash, the influence of Rashi can be seen in some of his commentaries, in the inclusion of midrashic citations.Berger, Yitzhak. \\"Peshat and the Authority of ·∏§azal in the Commentaries of Radak.\\" Association for Jewish Studies Review 31.1 (2007): 41-59. Print. Additionally, Kimhi lived among many famed proponents of Derash, such as Rabbi Moses the Preacher, who \\"undoubtedly had a substantial impact on Radak.\\" Kimhi tended to go out of his way to reject the views of the Rabbis of the Talmud often, which has led to the theory that, although disagreeing with them, Kimhi fully acknowledged the tradition and authority of the Talmud Rabbis. In his commentaries, Kimhi labels his interpretation as Peshat, and that of the Talmudic Rabbis as Derash, creating a strict divide between the two in his writings. A student of Saadiah Gaon is recorded as saying: \\"This is the sign by which you should know which comments well and which comments badly: Any commentator who first comments with peshuto shel mikra in concise language, and afterwards brings some of our rabbis' midrash, this is a good commentary, and the reverse is [a] crude [commentary].Commentary attributed to a student of Saadiah Gaon, Chronicles 36:13.

Kahana objected to Mar son of R. Huna: But this refers to the words of the Torah? A verse cannot depart from its plain meaning (◊§◊©◊ï◊ò◊ï), he replied. R. Kahana said: By the time I was eighteen years old I had studied the whole Talmud, yet I did not know that a verse cannot depart from its plain meaning (◊§◊©◊ï◊ò◊ï) until today.

The banquets spoken of by Homer relate to the tradition. Some reference to similar meals can be found in Carthage and according to Aristotle (Politics VII. 9), it prevailed still earlier amongst the Oenotrians of Southern Italy.This article relies heavily on the French Wikipedia article , translated 13 June 2006, as well as (Smith 1870) The origin of the syss√≠tia is unknown; while Lycurgus of Sparta certainly made use of the practice in Sparta, it is not known whether he introduced the practice or developed an existing one. == Sparta == In Sparta, where the system was most evolved, they were also called pheiditia (, The term is probably a corruption of philitia (\\"love-feast\\"),This should not be presumed to refer to a sexual nature; the connotation here is classical brotherly love. a word corresponding to the Cretan Hetairia. It was a daily obligatory banquet comparable to a military mess. Before the 5th century BC, the ritual was also referred to as the andreia, literally, \\"belonging to men\\". Obligation was total; no person, not even the two kings, could be absent without good excuse, such as performance of a sacrifice. Lesser excuses, such as being away on a hunt, implied a requirement to provide a present to the table (Smith 1870). The participation at the syssition was, as for other aspects of agoge, obligatory for membership in the Homoioi, the Peers. Spartans were admitted from the age of twenty after a ritual described by Plutarch in his Life of Lycurgus(ch 12): It was also possible for the young man to be presented by his erastes, a father figure who was (disputably) the elder in a pederastic relationship. Each person was supplied with a cup of mixed wine, which was filled again when required, although drunkenness was not tolerated. Following a main meal of black soup ( melas z≈çmos), an ·ºêœÄŒ¨œäŒ∫ŒªŒøŒΩ (epaiklon, or after-meal) was served, which consisted of game, fruit, poultry and other delicacies. Alcman (Frag. 31) tells, \\"at the banquets and drinking entertainments of the men it was fit for the guests to sing the paean\\". The arrangements were under the supervision of the polemarch. Each member was required to contribute a monthly share to the common pot, the œÜŒπŒ¥ŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ phid√≠tes, of which the composition has been noted by Dicaearchus (through Athenaeus and Plutarch ibid., 12): 77 litres of barley, 39 litres of wine, three kilograms of cheese, 1.5 kilograms of figs, and ten Aegina obols, which served to purchase meat. That served to prepare the main dish, the black soup, of which Athenaeus noted the ingredients: pork, salt, vinegar and blood. The kleros, the allotment given to each Spartan and cultivated by helots, was supposed to allow all citizens to pay their share. If that proved impossible, they were excluded from the syssitia. (Aristotle, Politics, II, 9). The number of members in each syssition remains vague. According to Plutarch in Life of Lycurgus, there were approximately 15 men in each syssition, but in his Life of Agis, the king divides his 4,500 citizens into 15 phidites of 400 or 200 members, that is 7 phidites of 400, 7 of 200, and 300 hippeis (elite Spartan guards). == Crete == The ancient Cretan name for the syssitia was also andreia, the singular of which ( (andreion) was used to denote the building or public hall in which they were given. The name hetairiai was also used. As in Sparta, the meals were for male citizens and youths only. Based on at least one source, however, (Pindar, Pythian Odes, IX, 18), it is possible that in some of the Dorian states, there were also syssitia of young unmarried women. The citizens were divided into messes that originally appear to have been along kinship lines, but vacancies were later filled at the discretion of the members. ŒñŒµ·Ω∫œÇ ·ºôœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒµ·øñŒøœÇ (Zeus Hetaireios) was the presiding deity. According to Dosiadas, cited in Athenaeus,The Deipnosophists, Book 4 138-148. each town in Crete had two public buildings; one for lodging strangers (koimeterion), as well as the andreion, where the syssitia took place. The upper part had two tables for foreign guests, tables for the citizen members and a third table to the right of the entrance for Zeus Xenios, likely used for offerings and libations. Cretan syssitia were distinguished by simplicity and temperance. They always sat at their tables, even in later times, when the custom of reclining had been introduced in Sparta. The entertainment began with prayer to the gods and libations. Each of the adult citizens received an equal portion of fare, with the exception of the Archon, or \\"Master of the Tables\\", who was perhaps in ancient times one of the Kosmoi, the highest officials in Cretan poleis before the 3rd century BCE, and more recently a member of the Gerousia. The Archon received four portions: \\"one as a common citizen, a second as President, a third for the house or building, a fourth for the furniture\\", which seems to imply that the care of the building and the provision of the necessary utensils and furniture were his responsibility. A free-born woman managed the tables and service; she openly took the best portion and presented it to the most eminent citizen present. She had three or four male assistants under her, each of whom again was provided with two menial servants. Strangers were served before citizens and even before the Archon. On each of the tables was placed a cup of mixed wine from which the messmates of the same company drank. At the close of the meal, it was replenished, but all intemperance was strictly forbidden by a special law. Youths under eighteen accompanied their fathers to the syssitia, along with orphans. In some places, the youngest of the orphans waited on the men; in others, that was done by all the boys. When not thus engaged, they were seated near to the men on a lower bench and received only a half portion of meat: the eldest of the orphans appear to have received the same quantity as the men but of a plainer description of fare (Athenaeus IV, 143). The boys and the men had also a cup of mixed wine in common, but it was not replenished when emptied. The meals were generally cheerful, and accompanied by music and singing. It was followed by conversation, which was first directed to the public affairs of the state and afterwards turned on valiant deeds in war and the exploits of illustrious men, whose praises might animate the younger hearers to an honourable emulation. While listening to that conversation, the youths seem to have been arranged in classes, each of which was placed under the superintendence of an officer especially appointed for that purpose. The syssitia were thus made to serve important political and educational ends. Unlike the Spartan format (see above), in most Cretan cities, > ...of all the fruits of the earth and cattle raised on the public lands, and > of the tribute which is paid by the Perioeci, one portion is assigned to the > Gods and to the service of the state, and another to the common meals, so > that men, women, and children are all supported out of a common stock. > (Aristotle Politics II. 10; Bekker 1272a)Aristotle, Politics trans Benjamin > Jowett. online accessed 14 June 2006 Based on Aristotle and Athenaeus, it appears that citizens received their share directly to pay part to the public table and another part to feed the females of the family. That practice, however, does not appear to have prevailed exclusively at all times and in all the cities of Crete. In Lyctus, for instance, a colony from Sparta, the custom was different: the citizens of that town contributed to their respective tables a tenth of the produce of their estates, which may be supposed to have obtained in other cities, where the public domains were not sufficient to defray the charges of the syssitia. However, both at Lyctus and elsewhere, the poorer citizens were in all probability supported at the public cost. The principal question is how one building would accommodate the adult citizens and youths of towns like Lyctus and Gortyna. Either the information is incorrect, and there was more than one andreion in larger towns, or the number of citizens in each town was small, a hypothesis supported by Xenophon (Hellenica, III, 3), who reported only 40 citizens in a crowd of 4,000 in Sparta.Xenophon Hellenica online accessed 14 Jun 2006. Crete had similar massive numbers of noncitizens. == Significance == The syssitia patently served to bring kinship groups together. In having those who would fight together eat together in peacetime, a strong bond was formed. The syssition effectively became an extended family in which all were \\"children of the state\\". They also ensured a separation between subject classes and citizens and, in Sparta, additional separation based on station and wealth and so were a strong tool for developing nationalism. Herodotus (I, 65) remarked that the Spartan syssition led to troops \\"who fought with more bravery and a keener sense of shame than would have been the case with chance comrades\\" (Smith 1870). While the syssitia, as opposed to symposia, were originally based on simplicity and sobriety, in Sparta, they gradually became more indulgent and luxurious. Some attempts were made by Agis IV to restore former discipline, but they ended in failure. == See also == *Ancient Greek cuisine *Symposium *Azoria, Crete (possible 6th century BC andreion recovered in excavations at the site) == Notes Bibliography== * * Edmond L√©vy, Sparte : histoire politique et sociale jusqu‚Äô√† la conqu√™te romaine, Seuil, \\"Points Histoire\\" collection, Paris, 2003 () * Pauline Schmitt-Pantel, La Cit√© au banquet: histoire des repas publics dans les cit√©s grecques, √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, 2000.

His real name was Juan Jos√© de los Reyes Mart√≠nez Amaro (1782‚Äì1863), son of Pedro Mart√≠nez and Mar√≠a Rufina Amaro. He married a woman named Maria Victoriana Bretadillo and had three children, Manuela, Doroteo and Francisca.Preator, B. (2006). History, literature and three legends from mexico's past (Order No. EP25475). Word for a hen turkey, it is said his nickname stands for his freckled face (similar to that of a turkey egg) or his laughter resembling the bird's peculiar gargle. P√≠pila was a miner. He came from the nearby town of San Miguel, now San Miguel de Allende, and worked in the Mellado mine. (The Rayas and Mellado mines were the first in Guanajuato, opened in 1558). Miners are of great importance in the state and city of Guanajuato, which was the largest exporter of silver in the world at the end of the 18th century. Silver and other minerals are still mined there today. P√≠pila, became famous for an act of heroism near the very beginning of the Mexican War of Independence, on 28 September 1810. The insurrection had begun in the nearby town of Dolores, led by Miguel Hidalgo, a criollo priest born in P√©njamo. He soon moved to the city of Guanajuato, Guanajuato, where the Spanish barricaded themselves-along with plenty of silver and other riches-in a grain warehouse known as the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas. The granary was a stone fortress with high stone walls, but its wooden door proved to be a shortcoming. With a long, flat stone tied to his back to protect him from the muskets of the Spanish troops, P√≠pila carried tar and a torch to the door of the Alh√≥ndiga and set it on fire. The insurgents-who far outnumbered the Spanish in the warehouse-stormed inside and killed all the soldiers and the civil Spanish refugees. Some accounts say that P√≠pila was not alone but went accompanied by other indigenous miners ready to fight for their freedom from the Spanish, but as the story is told today in Guanajuato, P√≠pila stood alone to break through the door.

Gesetz zur Verh√ºtung erbkranken Nachwuchses) or \\"Sterilisation Law\\" was a statute in Nazi Germany enacted on July 14, 1933, (and made active in January 1934)... made active: IBM and the Holocaust, Edwin Black, 2001 Crown / Random House, p 93 which allowed the compulsory sterilisation of any citizen who in the opinion of a \\"Genetic Health Court\\" (Gr. Erbgesundheitsgericht) suffered from a list of alleged genetic disorders ‚Äì many of which were not, in fact, genetic. The elaborate interpretive commentary on the law was written by three dominant figures in the racial hygiene movement: Ernst R√ºdin, Arthur G√ºtt and the lawyer Falk Ruttke. The law itself was based on the American Model Eugenical Sterilization Law developed by Harry H. Laughlin. ==Operation of the law== Reich Law Gazette on 25 July 1933: Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring. The basic provisions of the 1933 law stated that: The law applied to anyone in the general population, making its scope significantly larger than the compulsory sterilisation laws in the United States, which generally were only applicable on people in psychiatric hospitals or prisons. The 1933 law created a large number of \\"Genetic Health Courts\\", consisting of a judge, a medical officer, and medical practitioner, which \\"shall decide at its own discretion after considering the results of the whole proceedings and the evidence tendered\\". If the court decided that the person in question was to be sterilised, the decision could be appealed to \\"Higher Genetic Health Court\\". If the appeal failed, the sterilization was to be carried out, with the law specifying that \\"the use of force is permissible\\". The law also required that people seeking voluntary sterilizations also go through the courts. There were three amendments by 1935, most making minor adjustments to how the statute operated or clarifying bureaucratic aspects (such as who paid for the operations). The most significant changes allowed the Higher Court to renounce a patient's right to appeal, and to fine physicians who did not report patients who they knew would qualify for sterilisation under the law. The law also enforced sterilization on the so-called \\"Rhineland bastards,\\" the mixed-race children of German civilians and French African soldiers who helped occupy the Rhineland. At the time of its enaction, the German government pointed to the success of sterilisation laws elsewhere, especially the work in California documented by the American eugenicists E. S. Gosney and Paul Popenoe, as evidence of the humaneness and efficacy of such laws. Eugenicists abroad admired the German law for its legal and ideological clarity. Popenoe himself wrote that \\"the German law is well drawn and, in form, may be considered better than the sterilization laws of most American states\\", and trusted in the German government's \\"conservative, sympathetic, and intelligent administration\\" of the law, praising the \\"scientific leadership\\" of the Nazis.Paul Popenoe, \\"The German sterilisation law,\\" Journal of Heredity 25:7 (1934), 257-260, on 259-260. The German mathematician Otfrid Mittmann defended the law against \\"unfavorable judgements\\". In the first year of the law's operation, 1934, 84,600 cases were brought to Genetic Health Courts, with 62,400 forced sterilisations.IBM and the Holocaust, Edwin Black, 2001 Crown / Random House, pg 96. He cites Henry Friendlander, The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press, 1995, p 35 Nearly 4,000 people appealed against the decisions of sterilisation authorities; 3,559 of the appeals failed. In 1935, it was 88,100 trials and 71,700 sterilizations. By the end of the Nazi regime, over 200 \\"Genetic Health Courts\\" were created, and under their rulings over 400,000 people were sterilized against their will.Robert Proctor, Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1988): 108. Via Google Books. Along with the law, Adolf Hitler personally decriminalised abortion in case of fetuses having racial or hereditary defects for doctors, while the abortion of healthy \\"pure\\" German, \\"Aryan\\" unborn remained strictly forbidden.Henry Friedlander, The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of Northern Carolina Press, 1995): 30.

One of Wang Ji's other guests said that his wife was suffering from severe headaches while his son felt pain in his heart. Wang Ji then asked Guan Lu to find out why. Guan Lu used the casting lots method and told them that there were two dead bodies buried in the west corner of the main hall and that a wall had been built across them. One of them held a spear while the other carried a bow and arrows. The spearman died from a gash in his head while the archer died after being stabbed in the heart. Wang Ji then ordered his men to start digging and they found two badly decomposed bodies fitting exactly the description given by Guan Lu. Guan Lu then instructed them to rebury the bodies three miles outside the walls. After that, the woman and the boy recovered from their headaches and heart pains. Extending Zhao Yang's lifespan In another story, Guan Lu once saw a youth plowing a field, approached him and asked for his name. The youth, named Zhao Yang, was only 19 years old then. Guan Lu sensed an aura of death around Zhao Yang and predicted that he would die within three days, so he advised him on how to avoid his unfortunate fate. He said, \\"Tomorrow, go to the forest in the south. You will see two men sitting on boulders beneath a lofty tree playing chess. The sinister-looking one will be wearing white and facing south. The other man, who looks kind, will be wearing red. They will be so deeply engrossed in their game that they will not notice anyone approaching. You must then kneel down and humbly present them food and wine. After they have accepted your offerings, you must prostrate yourself and tearfully beg them to grant you an extension on your lifespan. You will then gain an increased span of life. Above all things, you must not tell them that I told you to do this.\\" The following day, the man in red replaced the number 9 with the number 1, which meant that he had altered Zhao Yang's fate to allow him to live until the age of 99. The two men, who were apparently deities in charge of deciding people's lifespans, then told Zhao Yang to go back to Guan Lu and warn him that if he attempted to meddle with the ways of fate again, he would suffer punishment from Heaven. Predicting the future for Deng Yang and He Yan Guan Lu also cast lots to predict the lives of Deng Yang and He Yan, two officials who served in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He told them, \\"Gaoxin and Gaoyang aided Shun; the Duke of Zhou aided the young King Cheng of the Zhou dynasty. They were kindly, modest and happy. You, Sirs, enjoy high prestige and power, but there are many who fear you and few who respect you. You are not careful to walk in the way of good fortune. Now the nose is an eminence. If an eminence retains its characteristic, thereby it remains in honour. But is it not that blue flies gather to foul objects and the lofty fears a fall? I would wish you to give of your abundance for the good of the poor and avoid walking in the wrong road. Then indeed may you reach the highest dignity, and the blue flies will disperse\\". After discussing this conversation with his uncle, Guan Lu then said: \\"Deng Yang's gait is that of one whose sinews are loosed from his bones, and his pulse is unsteady. When he would stand, he totters as a man without limbs. This is the aspect of a disembodied soul. He Yan looks as if his soul was about to quit its habitation. He is bloodless, and what should be solid in him is mere vapor. He looks like rotten wood. This is the aspect of a soul even now in the dark valley. Both these men will certainly soon die a violent death, and none need fear them\\". Soon afterwards, both Deng Yang and He Yan met their ends in the aftermath of the Incident at Gaoping Tombs in 249, just as Guan Lu predicted. As a result, Guan Lu became famous for being one of the most skilled diviners in his time, but there were others who saw him as a mad man. ==Works== Guan Lu wrote a number of texts, including: * \\"A method of contacting spirits using the Yi Jing\\" (Âë®ÊòìÈÄöÈùàÊ±∫) * \\"Summary of a method of contacting spirits using the Yi Jing\\" (Âë®ÊòìÈÄöÈùàË¶ÅÊ±∫) * \\"A classic on destroying manias\\" (Á†¥Ë∫ÅÁ∂ì) * \\"Winnowing divination\\" (Âç†ÁÆï) These texts were lost over time in the Three Kingdoms period; only their titles were recorded in history. ==In Romance of the Three Kingdoms== Guan Lu appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period. In Chapter 69, around the year 217, Cao Cao summons Guan Lu and orders him to use his divination skills to predict the future. Guan Lu predicts that Xiahou Yuan will be killed in action at the Battle of Mount Dingjun, Lu Su will die of illness, a fire will break out in Xuchang, etc. All his predictions came true. Historically, however, Guan Lu was only around eight years old in 217. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==NotesReferences== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

In Australia it was very popular from the 1960s to 1990s. In the United States, the name was fairly common from the late 1950s to mid 1990s, bolstered by the popularity of the film Tammy and the Bachelor (Tammy is commonly a nickname for Tamara). In the US the most girls named Tamara were born in 1970 and the number of Tamaras born per year was greater than 1,000 as late as 1996. The name is now fairly uncommon in the US: in 2010, the name fell off the Top 1000 SSA Baby Names list, with fewer than 250 baby girls named Tamara that year. ==Variants== Variations include Tamar, Temara, Tamra, Tamera, and Tamora. In North America Tamara is typically pronounced ; in the United Kingdom and Australia it is sometimes pronounced as ; and in Russia /t…êÀàm…ëÀêr…ê/ (written –¢–∞–º–∞ÃÅ—Ä–∞). In Arabic it is pronounced /t√¶Ààm√¶Àêr√¶/ (written ÿ™ŸÖÿßÿ±ÿß or ÿ™ŸÖÿßÿ±ÿ©). The most common US nickname for Tamara is Tammy or Tam, but other nicknames exist, such as Tatia (·Éó·Éê·Éó·Éò·Éê) Tamar (·Éó·Éê·Éõ·Éê·É†) Tamuna (·Éó·Éê·Éõ·É£·Éú·Éê), Tamari (·Éó·Éê·Éõ·Éê·É†·Éò), Tamriko (·Éó·Éê·Éõ·É†·Éò·Éô·Éù) or Tako (·Éó·Éê·Éô·Éù) in Georgia, Toma in Russia, Mara, Tama or Tara. One notable occurrence of the name 'Tamora' in literature is a character in Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. In this play, Tamora is an ambitious and vengeful woman. Her sons plan to rape the daughter of Titus Andronicus and Tamora refuses the girl's pleas to stop them. Titus, in revenge for the brutal rape and disfigurement of his daughter, kills the young men, has them baked into a pie, and serves the pie to Tamora. Titus tells her that she has just eaten her sons immediately before killing her. The term 'tamarro' entered Italian through the Neapolitan dialect, meaning \\"lowlife\\", \\"scumbag\\", with a specific bent to people who have a very strong tendency to copy the general mode, have uncultured behaviour and tend to buy and flaunt expensive branded goods.https://unaparolaalgiorno.it/significato/tamarro https://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/ricerca/tamarro/ ==Notable people == * Tamara Al-Gabbani, Emirati fashion designer *Tamara Braun, American soap opera actress *Tamara Buciuceanu, Romanian actress *Tamara Bunke, better known as Tania the Guerrilla, a communist revolutionary *Tamara Danz, German rock singer * Tamara Degtyaryova (Russian: –¢–∞–º–∞—Ä–∞ –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –î–µ–≥—Ç—è—Ä—ë–≤–∞; 1944 ‚Äì 2018), Russian stage, television and film actress *Tamara Dobson, African- American actress and model *Tamara Drasin, Ukrainian-born singer-actress *Tamara Duisenova, Kazakh politician *Tamara Ecclestone, English-Serbian socialite, television personality and model *Tamara Feldman, American actress *Tamara Georgijev, Serbian handball player *Tamara Gverdtsiteli, Georgian- Russian singer, actress and composer, People's Artist of Ingushetia, Georgia and Russia. *Tamara Jaber, Australian singer *Tamara Jones, singer and actress *Tamara Karsavina, Russian ballerina *Tamara Johnson, American indoor volleyball player *Tamara Larrea, Cuban beach volleyball player *Tamara de Lempicka, Polish art deco painter * Tamara Maria Kler or Tamara Hunkeler, Swiss DJ known by her stage name Dinka * Tamara Marthe, known as Shy'm, French singer *Tamara McKinney, American skier *Tamara Mello, American actress *Tamara Mellon, president and founder of designer shoes company Jimmy Choo *Tammy Faye Messner, American televangelist and reality TV star *Tamara Metal, Israeli Olympic high jumper and long jumper, and captain of the Israel women's national basketball team *Tamara Mkheidze, Georgian arachnologist *Tamar of Georgia, Queen of Georgia *Tamara Moskvina, Russian pairs figure skating coach *Tamara Gorski, Canadian actor *Tamara Moss, Indian model *Tamara Gr√§fin von Nayhau√ü, German television presenter *Tamara Pamyatnykh, Soviet fighter pilot during the Second World War *Tamara Radoƒçaj (born 1987), Serbian basketball player *Tamara Rojo (born 1974), Spanish ballet dancer, artistic director of English National Ballet *Tamara Salman, Iraqi-born designer *Tamara Macarena Valc√°rcel Serrano (born 1984), Spanish singer known as Tamara *Tamara Sher, American psychologist *Tamara Smart (born 2005), English actress *Tamara Sky, DJ and model *Tamara Taylor, Canadian actress *Tamara Todevska, Macedonian pop singer *Tamara Toumanova, Georgian-Armenian ballerina and actress, active in Paris and Hollywood *Tamara Tunie, American actress * Tamara Venit-Shelton, American author and professor of American history *Tamara Witmer, American actress and model * Tamara Diane Wimer, known as Isis Gee, American singer ==See also== *Tamsin (disambiguation) *Tara (disambiguation) *Palmyra *Tamara (disambiguation) ==References== Category:Feminine given names Category:English feminine given names Category:Arabic feminine given names Category:Spanish feminine given names Category:Slavic feminine given names Category:German feminine given names Category:Romanian feminine given names Category:Russian feminine given names Category:Circassian feminine given names Category:Czech feminine given names Category:Polish feminine given names Category:Slovak feminine given names Category:Slovene feminine given names Category:Macedonian feminine given names Category:Croatian feminine given names Category:Serbian feminine given names ","title":"Tamara (given name)"},{"id":"5567171","text":"James Fraser Forbes James Fraser Forbes (1820 ‚Äì 18 May 1887) was a Canadian politician and a member of the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Queens in Nova Scotia.

Lyrics are credited to Bernie Taupin (although John himself wrote the words to the final verse). The music was composed by John. \\"Border Song\\" initially appeared on the 1970 album Elton John, and was released in the spring of 1970 as the LP's first single. After failing to chart in the UK, it was released in North America a few months later. It met with more success there, especially in Canada, where it peaked at #34. The appearance of \\"Border Song\\" on the Canadian charts was Elton John's first chart appearance in any country. \\"Border Song\\" was also John's first song to chart in the United States, peaking at #92 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #69 in the Cash Box Top 100 in October 1970. A cover by soul icon Aretha Franklin (listed with \\"Holy Moses\\" following the title in parentheses, to make it more identifiable as being a repeated phrase in the song) fared better reaching #37 in the Billboard Hot 100 and #23 in the Cash Box Top 100 in December 1970. It was included as the closing track of Aretha's 1972 Young, Gifted and Black album as well. In the Netherlands it peaked at #29 in the Dutch Top 40 in January 1971. ==Music and lyrics== The song's melody is similar to that of a spiritual. A choir sings during an instrumental break led by John's piano. John has said that the song is about the alienation Taupin felt in and about London at the time (\\"Brand of people who ain't my kind\\"), and his desire to visit home as often as he could. John himself wrote and added the last verse, which departs from the theme of alienation and speaks against bigotry: \\"Holy Moses, let us live in peace/let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease/there's a man over there. What's his colour I don't care/he's my brother let us live in peace.\\" ==Format and track list== *1970 US/Canadian 7\\" single # \\"Border Song\\" 3:22 # \\"Bad Side of the Moon\\" 3:15 ==Personnel== * Elton John ‚Äì piano, lead vocals * Madeline Bell ‚Äì backing vocals * Tony Burrows ‚Äì backing vocals * Roger Cook ‚Äì backing vocals * Brian Dee ‚Äì organ * Lesley Duncan ‚Äì backing vocals * Kay Garner ‚Äì backing vocals * Colin Green ‚Äì guitar * Tony Hazzard ‚Äì backing vocals * Clive Hicks ‚Äì guitar * Barry Morgan ‚Äì drums * Dave Richmond ‚Äì bass *Choir led by Barbara Moore *Arranged and conducted by Paul Buckmaster ==Cover versions== US vinyl release of Aretha Franklin recording * Aretha Franklin's album 1972 album Young, Gifted and Black concludes with her solo cover of this song. * Elton John and Aretha Franklin performed the song together on Franklin's 1993 Duets special. * In 1996, Sophie B.

Born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, Hay began his football career at Kalgoorlie Catholic Primary School and John Paul College before moving to Perth in 1991. Hay played reserves football for East Fremantle Football Club in 1996 before being drafted by Hawthorn Football Club at the 1996 national AFL draft. ==Hawthorn career== Hay made his debut on a wing in 1997 and was considered a bright young defender with Hawthorn. All-Australian peak In 2001, he earned All-Australian selection and was slim, quick and continually kept full-forwards to low scores in a year where the Hawks made the Preliminary Final. Later Hawthorn career In 2004, an injury interrupted Hay's season, but he showed some signs of improvement in 2005. He then left the club at the end of the season and was traded to North Melbourne. ==North Melbourne career== The Kangaroos gave up one first-round pick for the then-26-year-old Hay. Hay debuted with the Kangaroos in 2006 and made several simple skill errors, with many commentators bemoaning his constant turnovers to the opposition and his poor disposal in defence. This led to Hay being dropped from the side and playing with North's then VFL affiliate Tasmania on 10 June 2006. Mental health In August 2006, Hay held a press conference to announce he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years earlier. He said his symptoms increased in 2006, which he gave as a reason for why the year had \\"gone bad for [him], on and off the field\\". After disputes over his contract during the 2007 pre- season,Wilson, Caroline, Roos, Hay in contract wrangle, The Age, 14 February 2007. it was announced on the day of the Kangaroos' first NAB Cup game that Hay would be retiring from the AFL. His contract was paid out in full, despite his acknowledged problems with drugs and alcohol. In March 2007, an interview by Craig Hutchison with Hay was aired on The Footy Show. Hay said during the interview he wanted the chance to tell Kangaroos supporters and the football public in general the reason for his sub-standard form, which he said was due to illicit drug use that he said exacerbated his mental health condition.Lyall Johnson, Hay admits to drug use early in career, The Age, 30 March 2007.

There are three characters in the Bible with this name. The pronunciation of Tamar depends on each so-named person's language, culture, and idiolectic preference; typical pronunciations in English are and . Variants include Tamary and \\"Tamara\\". The name was not often used in traditional Jewish societies, possibly because both Biblical characters bearing the name are depicted as involved in controversial sexual affairs. It was, however, among the Biblical names revived and actively promoted by the Zionist pioneers, and is a common female name in contemporary Israel (often shortened, as in other languages, to \\"Tammy\\" (◊™◊û◊ô) ‚Äì which is sometimes treated as name on its own). Tamar is common among Georgians, where its origin can be traced either to the above-mentioned Biblical Hebrew characters, to the sky goddess Tamar, who had an important role in the Georgians' mythology before their conversion to Christianity or to a convergence of both. In turn, the popularity of the name (especially in the version \\"Tamara\\") among Russians and other Slavic peoples can in part be traced to the centuries-long political and cultural contacts between Russians and Georgians. In particular, Russia was touched by the fame of the medieval queen regnant Tamar of Georgia, reckoned among the greatest of her country's monarchs and who had a Russian husband. Tamar was also among the Biblical names used by Puritans in the American Colonial Era in the 17th and 18th centuries.

A 6'7\\" small forward, Short averaged 17.3 points per game over his twelve-season career in the NBA. He is currently the Warriors seventh all-time leading scorer. After a brilliant career at Jackson State, Short was selected fifth overall in the 1978 NBA draft. Short was affectionately nicknamed \\"Rainbowman\\" because of the distinctive rainbow-like high arc of his jump shots, something he stated he obtained in high school. He was a role player and sixth man his first few years in the league. Short was a starter by the 1984‚Äì85 season, and scored a career high 59 points in a game against the New Jersey Nets in 1984. After leaving the NBA, he played one year of basketball in Israel, and is currently the director of the NBA Players Association's Department of Player Programs. == College career == Born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Purvis is the younger brother of Gene Short, who played one season in the league with the New York Knicks. Purvis attended Blair Center Hattiesburg High School, where he led his team to the state championship title in 1974. He was allegedly recruited by 150 colleges upon graduation. He followed in his brother's footsteps at Jackson State University, where he became the school's all-time leading scorer. He was the NCAA's second leading scorer in 1978, averaged 8.9 rebounds per game, and was named SWAC Player of the Year in 1977 and 1978. == Professional career == Short was drafted with the fifth overall pick of the 1978 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors who passed up drafting Larry Bird, who was drafted sixth. In his rookie season, Short scored 795 points for a 10.6 points per game average. The next year, Short had a 17.0 point per game average, with a career high .500 field goal percentage in 62 games. The Warriors traded for Bernard King prior to the 1980‚Äì81 season, moving Short to a reserve role. That year he played in 79 games, where he had 391 rebounds, a career high 249 assists, and a 16.1 points per game average. The next few seasons he was the Warriors sixth man, playing behind Joe Barry Carroll, until gaining the starting job prior to the 1984‚Äì85 season. Short started working out with Pete Newell during the off-seasons, which Short later claimed help improve his shooting skills significantly. During a November 17, 1984 game against the New Jersey Nets, Short scored a career high 59 points during a 131-114 loss. He hit 20 of 28 field goal attempts and 15 free throws. At the time, only nine other players had scored more points in one game, and it was the most points scored in the NBA since David Thompson and George Gervin scored 73 and 63 points respectively on April 9, 1978. Excluding Wilt Chamberlain's many games of 60 or over points as a Warrior, it was also the third highest total in franchise history, behind Joe Fulks' 63 points in 1949 and Rick Barry's 64 points in 1974. He also scored 57 points against the San Antonio Spurs and 46 against the Washington Bullets that season. Short finished the 1984‚Äì85 season with an average of 28.0 points per game, and was the NBA's fourth leading scorer. During the off-season, Short got involved in a contract dispute and held out for four weeks, but the Warriors managed to come to a contract agreement with him. He ended up with a 25.5 points per game average in 64 games in 1985‚Äì86, finishing fifth in the league in scoring. Short missed two months early in the 1986‚Äì87 season due to knee surgery. He missed further time with a pulled thigh muscle in March. Golden State reached the playoffs, an achievement Short later recalled as \\"the best time\\" in his Warriors career. He ended up appearing in 34 games that year, with an 18.3 points per game average. He was traded to the Houston Rockets for Dave Feitl and a future first round pick prior to the 1987‚Äì88 campaign. At the time of the trade, Short averaged 19.4 points per game in nine seasons with the Warriors and was sixth on the all-time scoring list while second in steals. He averaged 14.3 points per games in 81 games played that year, with 222 rebounds and 162 assists. The next season, Short had a career low 7.4 points per game in 65 games, 16 of them starts. Prior to the start of the 1989‚Äì90 season, Short signed as a free agent with the New Jersey Nets, where he played in all 82 games, starting 28 of them. He scored 29 points in a 109-101 win against the Charlotte Hornets on January 11. He could not come to an agreement with the Nets over the term of his contract and retired at season's end. After leaving the NBA in 1990, Short took a year off basketball. In early 1991 he returned to play, this time in Israel for Hapoel Tel Aviv. Short led the team to a successful season that ended in a 3-2 loss to archrivals Maccabi Tel Aviv during the playoffs.

A. (), formerly Sovereign Bank, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Spanish Santander Group. It is based in Boston and its principal market is the northeastern United States. It has $57.5 billion in deposits, operates about 650 retail banking offices and over 2,000 ATMs, and employs approximately 9,800 people. It offers an array of financial services and products including retail banking, mortgages, corporate banking, cash management, credit card, capital markets, trust and wealth management, and insurance. Sovereign Bank was rebranded as Santander Bank on October 17, 2013; the stadium, arena, and performing arts center for which it has naming rights were also rebranded. ==History== Santander Bank branch footprint in the eastern United States Santander Bank, Summer Street, Boston, United States Santander Bank, N.A., was founded in 1902 as \\"Sovereign Bank\\", a savings and loan in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The company's earliest customers were largely textile workers. Sovereign expanded rapidly during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, acquiring numerous other banks. In 2000, Sovereign bought 278 New England branches from the newly merged FleetBoston Financial, becoming the third-largest retail bank in the Boston area at one stroke. This transaction was driven by a requirement from bank regulators that Fleet Bank and BankBoston divest 306 branches as a condition for merger. Forty-five years before the founding of Sovereign Bank, its future parent was founded as Banco Santander on 15 May 1857, with the approval of Queen Isabel II of Spain. The bank grew and in the 1920s started to build a network of branches. In 1942 it opened in Madrid. In 1934 Emilio Bot√≠n Sanz de Sautuola y L√≥pez became director, and in 1950 chairman. He expanded the bank throughout Spain, so in 1957 it was Spain's seventh-largest bank. In 1976 it acquired First National Bank of Puerto Rico, and in 1982 Banco Espa√±ol-Chile. In 1986, Emilio senior's son, Emilio Bot√≠n Sanz de Sautuola y Garc√≠a de los R√≠os, succeeded him. In the late 1980s he acquired CC-Bank in Germany and a stake was in Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal. In 1989, the \\"Supercuenta Santander\\" was launched. Sovereign bought the naming rights to Mercer County's new arena in 1999 in support of newly acquired Trenton Savings Bank (formerly TSFS) and other New Jersey branches for a ten-year term. In following years, the bank also named the Sovereign Center arena and Sovereign Performing Arts Center in Reading, Pennsylvania, and Sovereign Bank Stadium in York, Pennsylvania. In June 2006, Banco Santander purchased almost 20% of Sovereign Bank for US$2.4 billion. As Banco Santander owned 25% of Sovereign, it had the right to buy the bank for $40 per share for one year beginning in the middle of 2008.ydr.com On June 1, 2006, Sovereign Bank purchased Independence Community Bank Corp. of Brooklyn, New York, for US$3.6 billion in cash. Sovereign completed the transition process of Independence and S.I. Bank & Trust customers on September 9, 2006. Sovereign financed this merger through its partial sale to Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano.myindependence.com On October 13, 2008, Banco Santander purchased the remainder of Sovereign for US$1.9 billion (1.4 billion euros). Sovereign Bank was severely affected by losses related to auto loans and stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Banco Santander had previously seen a loss of over $1 billion on its investment in Sovereign, when the latter's share price tumbled after being downgraded by Moody's in September 2008. On January 30, 2009, Banco Santander completed its acquisition of Sovereign Bank, for about $2.51 per share. In August 2011, the bank announced its plans to formally relocate its U.S. headquarters from Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, to Boston, Massachusetts, where its top executives had already been located for the previous few years. In late September 2011, the bank announced that it would officially change its name to \\"Santander\\" as part of its parent company's goal to create a global brand. The rebranding was completed on October 17, 2013. In March 2015, Scott Powell was appointed head of U.S. business at Santander, and CEO of Santander Holdings USA, replacing Roman Blanco. Powell left his role as CEO in December 2019. He was replaced by Timothy Wennes. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official Website Category:Banco Santander Category:American companies established in 1902 Category:Banks established in 1902 Category:Banks based in Massachusetts Category:Companies based in Boston ","title":"Santander Bank"},{"id":"5567287","text":"Sun and Steel is the sixth and final album released by Iron Butterfly in 1975.

They number approximately 30,000 with populations in both South Sudan and Ethiopia. Many Nyangatom are nomadic, residing in mobile livestock villages that may migrate several times a year. A substantial number of Nyangatom also reside in semi- permanent villages. It is common for individuals to move between mobile cattle camps and semi-permanent villages. The Nyangatom have intermittent conflict with many of their neighbors, especially the Turkana, Dassanetch, and Suri. The Kenyan government provides some military support to the Turkana in these conflicts. Despite the risk of intergroup conflict, many Nyangatom have bond friends with members of other groups and there are trade relationships between the Nyangatom and many of their neighbors. Along with other groups in the Lower Omo Valley, the Nyangatom face challenges to their future subsistence and cultural traditions due to large-scale agricultural projects occurring in their territory. ==External links== * BBC program Tribe, July 2006 * Website for Nyangatom Anthropology * Nyangatom in danger of denial of access or displacement ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Ethiopia Category:Ethnic groups in South Sudan Category:Ethiopia‚ÄìSouth Sudan relations ","title":"Nyangatom people"},{"id":"5567311","text":"Mayer's 2012 Daytona Prototype at Road America.

The arena opened in 1925 and was known as Huff Gymnasium until the 1990s. It is named after George Huff, who was the school's athletic director from 1895 to 1935. Huff Hall is home to the University of Illinois Fighting Illini volleyball and wrestling teams. Prior to the opening of Assembly Hall in 1963, it was home to the basketball team as well. Currently Huff Hall is used for a variety of sporting events, including men's and women's gymnastics, men's wrestling, and women's volleyball. At each athletic event banners are hung of past Illini heroes to remind the crowd of the rich tradition that Illini athletics have had. Every March from 1926 to 1962, Huff Gymnasium played host to the state finals of the Illinois High School Association boys' basketball tournament. Huff Hall also served as the home of the women's basketball team. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing through the mid-1990s, the team once again used Huff Hall for home games, as it struggled to fill up the Assembly Hall. Since 1997 the team has used the Assembly Hall exclusively, although it struggles with a losing record and to fill up the Assembly Hall. From 1927 to 2002 Huff Hall was also home to a 25-yard swimming pool which served as the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign Underwater Hockey club and the University of Illinois Water Polo Club. The pool had a consistent depth of 8 ft. which made it ideal for these activities. Huff Hall Swimming Pool, circa 2001. In addition to hosting athletic events, Huff Hall is also the home of the College of Applied Health Sciences.

Platt and University Architect James M. White. The building's architecture matches that of the Armory, Main Library, the Union, and other campus buildings. At the conclusion of its $772,000 construction in 1925, Huff Hall replaced the Military Drill Hall (now known as Kenney Gym Annex) as the home for Fighting Illini basketball. The \\"New Gymnasium\\" was renamed Huff Gymnasium in 1937 following the longtime athletic director's passing. ==Men's basketball records at Huff Hall == { cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"70%\\" center;\\" - 14294B; color:#DF4E38;\\" !

In 1989, Maryland tied Penn State, 13‚Äì13, with a last-minute field goal.COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SOUTH; Maryland Kick Ties Penn State, The New York Times, November 12, 1989. When the game was last played in 1993, the all-time series record stood at 35 Maryland losses, one win, and one tie. The tie game broke the Terrapins' 24-game losing streak against Penn State.Penn State vs Maryland, 1961-1989, Stassen Football, retrieved May 31, 2010. Krivak's signature win however, was the 1990 upset road win against #8 and Sugar Bowl bound Virginia. Following the 1990 season, new athletic director Andy Geiger and Krivak agreed to a five-year contract extension. Krivak tendered his resignation after posting a 2‚Äì9 record during an injury riddled 1991 campaign. After the season, athletic director Andy Geiger had initiated a review of the program, which included interviews with the players, some of whom directly criticized Krivak to Geiger. With his resignation, Krivak cited a loss of credibility in the face of the criticism from his players.Krivak Resigns as Maryland Football Coach; Says Credibility Hurt by Remarks, The Washington Post, December 7, 1991.Terrapins are slow to learn firing Krivak sends wrong signal, The Free Lance-Star, December 11, 1991.

In 1996, Virginia offensive coordinator Tom O'Brien left to take the head coaching position at Boston College, and during the Carquest Bowl, Krivak called the offensive plays in the interim. Virginia lost to Miami, 31‚Äì21. Some observers expected Krivak to be promoted to the position full-time, but in February 1997, Welsh said he was considering calling plays himself without an offensive coordinator. Krivak resigned from the staff shortly afterward.FOUR ASSISTANTS JOIN CAVS' FOOTBALL TEAM, The Newport News Daily Press, March 27, 1997.

Reinhardt was a prominent scholar in health care economics and a frequent speaker and author on subjects ranging from the war in Iraq\\"Innocents In Uniform.\\" New York Times, March 22, 2003; A5.Who's Paying for our Patriotism Washington Post, Aug 1, 2005; A17. to the future of Medicare. == Biography == Reinhardt was born 1937 in Osnabr√ºck, Germany, and later emigrated to Canada where he received his Bachelor of Commerce degree from University of Saskatchewan. He later received a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in 1970, with a thesis titled \\"An Economic Analysis of Physicians' Practices\\" under the supervision of Richard Ruggles. He taught courses in economic theory and policy, accounting, and health economics and policy. Reinhardt's scholarly work focused on economics and policy and included more far-reaching topics such as cost-benefit analyses of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the Space Shuttle. He died on November 14, 2017 in Princeton, NJ. In July 2015 Reinhardt's 2013 syllabus and first lecture for a class titled \\"Introductory Korean Drama\\" received attention from several bloggers. By way of explanation, Reinhardt introduced the class by stating It was not clear whether Reinhardt actually intended to teach the course. == Research == Reinhardt's research focused on hospital pricing, systems of health care around the world, Medicare reform, and health care spending. His work appeared in Health Affairs, The New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, The British Medical Journal, and The European Heart Journal. In one paper, Reinhardt discusses the obstacles to success of consumer-directed health care in light of the lack of transparency in hospital pricing. He suggests several reforms that could lead to better information on hospital pricing for consumer decision-making, including a national set of diagnosis-related group weights to which each hospital could then apply its own conversion factor. Reinhardt's previous work on hospitals examined the tax and cost of equity capital advantages of not-for-profit hospitals over for-profit hospitals. Reinhardt's scholarship analyzed the U.S. health care industry in relation to systems around the world. He argued that higher U.S. health spending is a result of higher U.S. per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as well as intricate and disjointed payment systems. Reinhardt's work on foreign systems of health care includes a 2004 analysis of Switzerland that appeared in JAMA. In it, Reinhardt argued that there is little correlation between the prevalence of consumer choice and the high quality of Swiss health care. In 2003, Reinhardt and 14 other experts on health policy and the private health care industry signed an open letter arguing that Medicare should lead the U.S. health care industry in paying for performance by tying financial reimbursement to quality measures. Reinhardt's work on health care spending includes his argument that the aging of the U.S. population is not the primary cause of the growth in U.S. health care spending. == Private industry and advisory roles == In addition to his university duties, Reinhardt was active as an advisor for government, non-profit organizations, and private industry and held directorships in various for-profit companies in the health industry. Reinhardt served on the Governing Council of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences between 1979 and 1982, after election to the Institute in 1978. At the Institute, he served on a number of study panels, including the Committee on the Implications of For-Profit Medicine, the Committee on Technical Innovation in Medicine, the Committee on the Implications of a Physicians Surplus, and the Committee on the U.S. Physician Supply. In 1996, he was appointed to the Board of Health Care services of the Institute. From 1986-1995, Reinhardt served three consecutive three-year terms as a Commissioner on the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), established in 1986 by the Congress to advise it on issues related to the payment of physicians. Reinhardt served as a Commissioner for the Kaiser Family Foundation Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. Reinhardt was a member of numerous editorial boards, among them The New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, The Journal of Health Economics, the Milbank Quarterly, and Health Affairs. Reinhardt served as a trustee of Duke University and the Tekla Family of Funds. He also served on the Boards of Directors of Boston Scientific Corporation, a leading maker of medical devices, and Amerigroup Corporation, a large health insurer whose clients consist primarily of persons enrolled in Medicare. He served on the Board of Directors of Triad Hospitals, Inc, until that company was merged into Community Health Systems in 2007. He was a regular contributor to the New York Times' Economix blog, where he wrote about economic matters, particularly the economics of health care. Role in Taiwan's healthcare system and award In 1989, as Taiwan was restructuring its healthcare system, Reinhardt persuaded its leaders to model it on those of Canada and Germany. As of 2014, Taiwan's system provides universal care for 6.6% of GDP. For his contribution, in 2014 he was awarded the nation's Presidential Prize.NY Times Obituary for Uwe Reinhardt, Sam Price, 15 Nov 2017 \\"Reinhardt Receives Honors for Contributions to Health Care Economics,\\" B.

He is Professor of Medical Genetics and Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto, Visiting Professor of Chemical Biology at the University of Oxford, and Adjunct Professor at McGill University. == Early life == Born in Holyhead, Wales, Edwards moved to Canada in 1965 with his parents Undeg and Iwan Edwards, a choral conductor who was awarded the Order of Canada in 1995 for his contributions to Canadian music. == Education == Edwards earned his bachelor's degree (1983) and his Ph.D. (1988) in biochemistry from McGill University supervised by Peter Braun. He carried out post-doctoral studies at Stanford University in the laboratory of Roger Kornberg, where he first crystallized RNA polymerase II, a structure for which Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006. ==Research contributions== From 1992 to 1997, while a professor at McMaster University, Edwards became interested in developing structural biology methods and was among the first to use mass spectrometry to identify regions of proteins prone to crystallization. He used this technique to facilitate the crystallography of key proteins involved in DNA replication and repair before becoming interested in applying this and other methods to carry out structural biology on a proteome scale. In 1997, now at the University of Toronto, Edwards, together with his colleague Cheryl Arrowsmith, collaborated to launch one of the first projects in structural genomics, and soon published one of the papers that defined this new field. As a central player in the Protein Structure Initiative, their Toronto team contributed to more than a thousand new microbial protein structures over the next decade, developed new crystallization methods, and used structural methods to de-orphanize several nuclear receptors and study ion transport across membranes. As of 2019, Edwards has co-contributed more datasets to the Protein Data Bank than any other scientist. == Business activities == In the late 1990s, Edwards co-founded and served as CEO of Borealis Biosciences and Chalon Biotech, which he merged to form Affinium Pharmaceuticals, a Toronto- based company. Affinium developed afabicin, a novel narrow-spectrum antibiotic that is now in clinical development at DebioPharm. Several other companies have been spun out of his research programs, including Harbinger Biotechnology and Engineering, which was acquired by Epiphyte3, and 1DegreeBio, which was acquired by LabX Media Group. More recently, Edwards founded M4K Pharma, a company that is developing a brain-penetrant drug targeting the ALK2 kinase, in order to treat children with incurable diffuse-intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The novel open science business model being developed by M4K Pharma allows its science to be disclosed on an ongoing basis, and for any approved drug to be priced affordably. Edwards serves on the Board of the Agora Open Science Trust. == Open science and science policy ==  Open Science  Edwards is considered one of the pioneers of open science, particularly as it applied to biomedicine and drug discovery. Since 2003, all human protein structural information derived from the SGC has been placed into the public domain, prior to publication and without restriction on use. In 2007, he, together with Richard Gold, created the SGC Open Science Principles, under which the SGC became the first biomedical research organization to adopt open science principles that mandated sharing and eschewed patenting on any activity, including novel chemistry. In 2016, Edwards both spearheaded the Open Lab Notebook initiative, which now comprises over 20 scientists sharing their experiments as they are done, as well as collaborated with Guy Rouleau at the Montreal Neurological Institute (The Neuro) to create the concept of an open research institute. That collaboration led to the formation of the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute, and to the broader institutional commitment of The Neuro to open science. In 2017, Edwards and colleagues conceptualized an open trust mechanism to share research reagents, and the SGC has been using this mechanism since. Finally, in 2018, Edwards, Max Morgan and Owen Roberts launched the world‚Äôs first open science drug discovery company, M4K (Meds for Kids) Pharma, and developed a business model that is consistent with open science and affordable pricing. In 2019, Morgan and Edwards launched M4ND Pharma, to tackle neurological diseases using open drug discovery approaches. For his leadership role in promoting open access drug discovery, Edwards was named a Senior Ashoka Fellow in 2015.  Science and innovation policy  On the 10th anniversary of the publication of the draft sequence of the human genome, Edwards and colleagues were asked for their perspective. Their ‚ÄúRoads not Taken‚Äù paper, which quantified the ‚Äúunder-studied‚Äù parts of the human genome, has led to a number of funding initiatives, including the Illuminating the Druggable Genome initiative at the NIH, and presaged a number of studies that examine the unintended consequences of the peer-review system. Edwards is a champion of science reproducibility, focusing considerable attention on the quality of research reagents and the need for transparent standards. Edwards has also contributed to science communication; he served as the scientific advisor for the Gemini Award-winning television series ReGenesis. ==Personal== Edwards has been married to Elizabeth Edwards since 1985, and they have three children and one grandchild. Elizabeth is director of BioZone and Professor of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry at the University of Toronto, and winner of Canada‚Äôs 2016 Killam Prize for Engineering, among other awards. She is the daughter of Leonhard and Jeanne Wolfe, who was awarded the Order of Canada in 2009 for her contributions to Canadian planning. Aled‚Äôs brother, Owain Edwards, is an entomologist at CSIRO in Australia. == References == Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:Living people Category:Canadian biochemists Category:Welsh emigrants to Canada Category:1962 births Category:Scientists from Toronto Category:Open science Category:Ashoka Canada Fellows ","title":"Aled Edwards"},{"id":"5567357","text":"Star Collection is a German compilation album released in 1973.

It is used in Indian music to define the tala, or rhythmic pattern, and is one of the most important parts of Indian rhythm. Bol is derived from the Hindi word bolna, which means \\"to speak.\\" Mnemonic syllables are used in a variety of classical drumming situations in India. They are found in the pakhawaj and the tabla. However since the pakhawaj has become rather rare, the term bol is mostly thought to apply to the tabla. There is only a very loose connection between the bols and their technique. Sometimes different techniques are used because different musicians represent different gharanas, or musical styles. Sometimes different techniques are used in order to get a technical advantage (e.g., playing very fast). Sometimes different techniques are used simply because a different artistic statement is being made. For these reasons, it is impossible to categorically say that a certain bol will be executed in any one fashion. In the tabla just as in the case of the mridingum and pakhawaj one who has learned the art of playing these drums is taught to recite what he is going to play. What is recited is said to be the bol. The recitation contains various consonant vowel sequences. It is expected that the actual rendering on the drum mimics the bol. ==See also== * Konakkol * Kuchi sh≈çga * Counting (music) ==External links== *KKSongs Talamala - Tabla Bol Reference has recordings of tabla bols. *Instruments in Depth: Tabla: Drums of North India, an online feature from Bloomingdale School of Music (March, 2008) *Chandra & David's Tablasite contains detailed instructions on producing each bol.

Other common names include prairie berry, silverleaf nettle, white horsenettle or silver nightshade. In South Africa it is known as silver- leaf bitter-apple or satansbos (\\"Satan's bush\\" in Afrikaans). More ambiguous names include \\"bull-nettle\\", \\"horsenettle\\" and the Spanish \\"trompillo\\".Cronquist et al. (1984), USDA (2006) The plant is also endemic to the Middle East.Mohammed al-Oudat and Manzoor Qadir, The Halophytic Flora of Syria, Aleppo 2011, p. 31 Solanum elaeagnifolium was described by A. J. Cavanilles. The plant described under the same name by W. Herbert and C. L. Willdenow based on E.G. von Steudel is Solanum aethiopicum. ==Description and ecology== It is a perennial 10 cmNiehaus et al. (1984) to 1 m in height. The stems are covered with nettle-like prickles, ranging from very few on some plants to very dense on others. Leaves and stems are covered with downy hairs (trichomes) that lie against and hide the surface, giving a silvery or grayish appearance.Cronquist et al. (1984) Closeup of S. elaeagnifolium flower Closeup of S. elaeagnifolium berries The leaves are up to 15 cm long and 0.5 to 2.5 cm wide, with shallowly waved edges, which distinguish it from the closely related Carolina Horsenettle (S. carolinense), which has wider, more deeply indented leaves. The flowers, appearing from April to August, have five petals united to form a star, ranging from blue to pale lavender or occasionally white; five yellow stamens and a pistil form a projecting center. The plant produces glossy yellow, orange, or red berries that last all winter and may turn brown as they dry. Its range is from Kansas south to Louisiana, and west through the Mexican-border states of the United States into Mexico, as well as Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile.USDA (2006) It may have originated in North America and was accidentally introduced to South AmericaWSNWCB (2008) or the reverse. It can grow in poor soil with very little water. It spreads by rhizomes as well as seeds, and is common in disturbed habitats. It is considered a noxious weed in 21 U.S. states and in countries such as Australia, Egypt, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.Nugent (2005), WSNWCB (2008) It is toxic to livestock and very hard to control, as root stocks less than 1 cm long can regenerate into plants.CDFA [2008] However, some gardeners encourage it as a xeriscape ornamental. The Pima Indians used the berries as a vegetable rennet, and the Kiowa used the seeds together with brain tissue to tan leather. ==Toxicity== Ingestion of silverleaf nightshade has been implicated as a cause of ivermectin toxicosis in horses given the recommended dosage of the drug. Metabolites from the plant are speculated to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, allowing ivermectin to enter and disrupt neurotransmitter function in the brain and spinal cord. ==Synonyms== Flowering branch of S. elaeagnifolium This plant has been described under a range of names, all now invalid.

He is the main actor in a series of graphic novels which appeared in installments on several Italian comics magazines during the early 1980s. Zanardi first appeared on Frigidaire magazine in 1981, in Giallo Scolastico (\\"High School Mystery\\"). The character quickly found an enthusiastic audience in the clique of young, artsy, new- waveish Italians who were disillusioned with the previous decade's political slant and were instantly hooked on the character's basic, hedonistic individualism and cynicism, tempered with cultural influences ranging from Joseph Conrad to Vladimir Mayakovsky. The Zanardi graphic novels were reprinted several times in the decades following Pazienza's death, in original (black and white) and colored form. Pazienza's original drawings were mostly colored by his wife, Marina Comandini, but some episodes have been coloured by unknown students in Bologna's Art School, to which Pazienza gave the original drawings on a whim. ==Character traits== Zanardi is a 21-year-old Italian high school student at the Liceo Scientifico Enrico Fermi in Bologna. He is a tall, blond, thin, well-dressed In Massimo Zanardi, L'Inesistente (\\"The Nonexistent\\") a young girl who is in the same class as Zanardi writes in her diary: \\"But he's so elegant, and he came to skool [sic] in a black tuksedoe [sic] today\\". son of a bourgeois family, and his distinctive physical feature is an exaggerated, prominent hooked nose. He is also a junkie, but his addiction never seems to impair his cool, confident public front. Behind that front, Zanardi is an utterly amoral schemer who is always looking for either drugs or revenge, and always gets both in the end, literally destroying other people's lives without the slightest trace of remorse. Zanardi is usually accompanied in his doings and wrongdoings by two schoolmates, Colasanti (full name: Roberto Colasanti) and Petrilli (full name: Sergio Petrilli, often in the endearing form Sergino, or \\"Little Sergio\\"), with which he has established a sort of Clockwork Orange partnership, and who provide help, counterpoint and occasional comic relief to Zanardi's archetypal amorality. It is worthy of notice that the three almost never address each other by name in conversation, resorting either to surnames (which automatically entails a sort of detachment in Italian) or to distortions of them, thus Zanardi becomes Zanna (fang); Colasanti becomes Colas; Petrilli becomes Pietra (literally stone or rock as a possible pun on drugs). It is also worthy of notice that although the three are almost always featured as spending a lot of their time together hanging out, they do not consider themselves as friends.During one scene in Giallo Scolastico where Zanardi is faced with being turned in to the police for having disemboweled and crucified his teacher's cat, the mates' dialogue is as follows: Petrilli: Zanna, stavolta ci finisci. (Zanna, you're doing time this time.) Colasanti: Ci finiamo. Stai parlando con Zanardi. (We are doing time. Remember you're talking to Zanardi.) Zanardi: Vedete, noi tre siamo fatti cos√¨. Se non sapeste che vi tirerei dentro, fareste finta di non conoscermi. Non siamo mica vecchi amici! (You see, that's what we three are like. If you didn't know I'd turn you in as well, you'd pretend you never met me. We're not old pals!) Colasanti is a very handsome, gym-sculpted cold boy who loves to hit on every girl he meets. But he is also an occasional rent boy who ruthlessly exploits his sexual power over men and women. In Giallo Scolastico, Colasanti helps Zanardi to blackmail a nerdy schoolmate who is a closet homosexual by sodomizing him while Zanardi photographs the act with a Polaroid stolen for the occasion, in order to force him to fetch compromising evidence from a teacher's house. Colasanti is usually Zanardi's helping hand in exacting revenge. At the same time, he suffers from his lack of culture and hipness and is prone to fits of rage every time his mates remind him he is \\"such an ignoramus\\". Petrilli, while being the group's best born and possibly best educated member, is the eternal loser. He is constantly abused and humiliated by Zanardi and Colasanti, is often in love with some nameless and personality-less girl at the same high school he attends with Zanardi and Colasanti only to see her succumb to the charms of his hateful but more attractive friends, and always gets the short end of the stick in the shady dope deals Zanardi sets up. In fact, Petrilli dies a horrible death in the last story of the Frigidaire canon, Notte di Carnevale (Carnival Night), being burned alive in a Zanardi-staged prank arson of an all-female religious college which runs amok. Except the whole story is only a dream, to which Petrilli wakes in terror to run outside in the street and get run over by a truck. The character's death, however, only appears to be temporary, as in later stories Petrilli is still alive and being taken advantage of by his mates. Many concepts and stories from Zanardi, along with Pentothal and some isolated vignettes, were adapted into a motion picture by Renato de Maria, Paz! (2002), which is more of an overall tribute to the work of Andrea Pazienza than an actual comic strip tie-in. ==Zanardi stories: Frigidaire canon (1981)== * Giallo scolastico (High School Mystery) * Pacco (Scam) * Verde matematico (Mathematical Green) * Notte di Carnevale (Carnival Night) These stories originally appeared in black-and-white installments on Frigidaire magazine during 1981-1982. They were reprinted with colour by unknown Art School students in Zanardi, a collection published by Primo Carnera Editore in 1983, with a new black-and-white story tying the episodes together entitled La propriet√† transitiva dell'uguaglianza (The Transitive Property of Equality). The volume was reprinted in 1998 by Baldini & Castoldi Editore as a \\"Critical Edition\\", with unreleased drawings and writings by Pazienza. The stories were re-coloured for the occasion by Marina Comandini. Giorno is considered as a prologue of sorts to Zanardi, in that it anticipates the storytelling conventions and some general themes, though neither Zanardi nor his mates appear in it. ==Zanardi stories: major non-Frigidaire episodes (1984)== * Lupi (Wolves), colour by Andrea Pazienza, 1984 * La prima delle tre (The First Of The Three), black-and-white, 1985 These stories appeared on Corto Maltese magazine and alter alter, and represent significant developments in the Zanardi \\"universe\\", though removed from the original series which gained Pazienza nationwide success as a comics artist. ==Zanardi stories: scattered episodes (1983-1988)== * Massimo Zanardi, l'inesistente (The Nonexistent), 1983 * Prologo (Prologue), 1986 * I modi: Cuore di mamma (The Ways: Heart Of Mother), 1986 * I modi: Cenerentola 1987 (The Ways: Cinderella 1987), 1987 * Zanna (Fang), 1987 * Zanardi at the war, 1987 * Zanardi medievale (aka Zanardi In The Middle Ages), 1987-88 * Storiella bianca (Little White Tale), 1988 * La logica del fast-food (The Logic Of Fast-Food), 1988 These stories appeared in Frigidaire and Comic Arts magazines and various collections by Editori Del Grifo.

About 1565 he entered the yeshiva of Rabbi Solomon Luria of Lublin, and, after receiving his rabbinical ordination, became rabbi of Che≈Çm, a position he would hold for the rest of his life.

Finally, the rabbi extracted the Shem from the forehead of his Golem, which returned to dust, but the Golem scratched his master's face in the process. An anonymous 1630 manuscript (the earliest known written legend of a contemporary figure creating a golem) recounts that the golem continued to grow that the rabbi had to destroy it by erasing the Hebrew letter aleph, first letter from the word emet (truth)(◊ê◊û◊™)Sefer Yetzirah Timeline thereby rendering it met (dead)(◊û◊™).see English Wikipedia article Taw#In Judaism Although Emden only mentions a scratch on the rabbi's face, a different version of the legend states that while trying to remove the life- giving name of God in an attempt to destroy the raging beast, Rabbi Elijah was crushed to death under the weight of the Golem as it fell to pieces.Kieval, Hillel J.

The story is told that a German-speaking Palestinian Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed Dolberger. So when the knights of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members who was among them rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to Worms, Germany to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakhic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.Epstein, in \\"Monatsschrift\\", xlvii. 344; Jerusalem: Under the Arabs ==Funeral== According to popular legend, Elijah's greatness was witnessed in dramatic fashion soon after his death. It was said that during his time, the only road to the Jewish cemetery passed by a Russian church. Whenever a Jewish funeral procession passed by, Christians would throw rocks. Elijah knew of this and requested in his will that no one move or run away if the Christians did the same following his death. Elijah's wishes were carried out after his death. When the procession neared the church, gentiles began their ritual of pelting the coffin and the Jews with rocks, Elijah miraculously sat up and, after looking into the Torah scroll that was in the coffin [to be buried with him], the church sank together with the hooligans. The rabbi then lay back and became rigid as a corpse again. The Jews stared at each other in astonishment and the funeral procession continued. From this time forward, it was said that the hooligans no longer threw rocks during Jewish funerals. Years later, pupils of the Kheder (Jewish elementary school) of a teacher named Leib Paks claimed that in the cellar, when jumping on the floor boards, the muffled ring of a bell sound could be heard. This led the children to believe that that was the very same spot where the church had sunk. ==Grave== Within the Che≈Çm cemetery, there was a grave without a tombstone which was covered in bricks arranged in the shape of the Hebrew letter \\"Bet\\". This was believed to be the final burial place of Rabbi Elijah. Legend has it an angel would appear on the anniversary of his death and etch a letter on a certain brick. Because of this, everyone was afraid to touch the bricks. == See also == *Baal Shem *Elijah Loans *Eliyahu Baal Shem of Worms ==References== Category:Baal Shem Category:Early Acharonim Category:1550 births Category:1583 deaths Category:16th-century rabbis ","title":"Elijah Ba'al Shem of Che≈Çm"},{"id":"5567432","text":"The Grande √éle () is an island that lies at the historic centre of the city of Strasbourg in France.

Through the town runs the Deutsche M√§rchenstra√üe, or German Fairytale Road, a touristic route joining many of the places commonly associated with the Brothers Grimm's tales. ==Geography== The town lies at the top of the Rhine- Weser watershed between the east-flowing Antrift and the west-flowing Gleen. Neighbouring communities Kirtorf borders in the north on the town of Neustadt (Marburg-Biedenkopf), in the east on the community of Antrifttal, the town of Alsfeld and the community of Romrod, in the south on the community of Gem√ºnden, and in the west on the town of Homberg (Ohm), and the town of Stadtallendorf (Marburg-Biedenkopf). Constituent communities Besides the town's main centre, which bears the same name as the whole municipality, there are outlying centres named Arnshain, Gleimenhain, Heimertshausen, Lehrbach, Ober-Gleen and Wahlen. ==History== Kirtorf was mentioned in a document as Gleene in 917. Kirtorf was the seat of a Sendgericht, a church court that tried cases of sin, vice and the like, under the Bishopric of Mainz. This court included 40 places. From 1205, the town belonged to the Abbey of Fulda, the Counts of Ziegenhain were the V√∂gte ( ‚âà sheriffs) here and held jurisdiction in the Eu√üergericht court district until the 14th century. By 1366, the Landgraves of Hesse had come into ownership of some parts of the court district. Kirtorf's town rights were granted in 1489. On 1 April 1725, the town almost completely burnt down; only the town hall (built in 1559) was left standing and unscathed. Amalgamations All constituent communities named above were united as part of Hesse's municipal reforms in 1971. ==Politics== Mayor is Andreas Fey, who is indeed a member of the SPD, but is party-less and won against his challenger Karsten Jost with 51% of the vote. Honorary Mayor is Ulrich K√ºnz. He was elected mayor of the city on March 11, 1977. He was from 11 March 1977 to 11 March 2019 mayor and thus the longest serving in Germany. On February 15, 2019, he was appointed mayor. The UWL / SPD faction voted in favor. Kirtorf's town council has 23 councillors. As of municipal elections held on 6 March 2016 the seats are apportioned thus: {  FWG/CDU  : 17 seats ----  SPD/UWL  : 6 seats } Note: FWG and UWL are citizens' coalitions.

Originally built in the early 1980s by A Goninan & Co for Westrail of Western Australia, they were sold in 1993 by Westrail's successor, Transperth, to Tranz Rail. The units are currently owned by Auckland Transport. ==History== Auckland Railway Station, prior to 2003 Westfield in October 2005. Between 1982 and 1985, ten two-carriage stainless steel sets were manufactured for Transperth by A Goninan & Co, Newcastle. Following the electrification of the Perth rail network they were rendered surplus and in 1993 all were sold, along with the older ADK/ADB class, to New Zealand Rail to replace locomotive-hauled 56-foot carriages on suburban trains in Auckland. The units arrived in Auckland from Perth in April 1993. One unit went to Hutt Workshops in the winter of 1993 for staff familiarisation, while the other units were prepared for New Zealand service at Westfield locomotive depot. As a result of the units introduction, station platforms in Auckland needed to be raised. In October 1993, prior to New Zealand Rail being privatised, the company sold the class to the Auckland Regional Council. == Upgrades == In 2002, the Auckland Regional Council funded an upgrade of the class, which included refurbishment of the interiors and painting in the new MAXX blue colour scheme. The first refurbished unit entered service in December 2002, the last in November 2003. In 2011, Auckland Transport indicated four two-car sets would be retained after the Auckland rail electrification project is completed. Due to the introduction of the AM class electric multiple unit on all of Auckland's suburban railway lines, the ADL/ADC units are now only used between Pukekohe and Papakura station as a shuttle service. This is due to that portion of the North Island Main Trunk not currently being electrified. In 2020 the government announced funding for electrification of this section, which once completed will render the ADL/ADL DMUs surplus to requirements. ==Notes and references==  References  * (First edition 1990, 1991) * ==External links== * ADL class Auckland 1993 - New Zealand Railways Rollingstock List Category:Diesel multiple units of New Zealand Category:Diesel multiple units of Western Australia ","title":"ADL/ADC class diesel multiple unit"},{"id":"5567549","text":"Michael R.

It was written by lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. The song was first released as a B-side to the CD version of their hit single \\"Wonderwall\\" in October 1995. \\"The Masterplan\\" was also released with the Stop the Clocks EP in November 2006. It also shares its name with the 1998 B-side compilation album, The Masterplan, on which it is featured as the last track. Noel Gallagher has regularly declared \\"The Masterplan\\" one of the best songs he has ever written. However, he regrets the fact that it was first released as a B-side, admitting he was \\"young and stupid\\" when he made that decision. He also claims that Creation Records boss Alan McGee, upon hearing the song, told Noel it was \\"too good\\" to be a B-side. Noel reportedly replied, \\"Well, I don't write shit songs!\\"3FM interview, 24 November 2005 In 2020, he told Music Week, \\"The singles had to have three B-sides and I was always coming up two songs short.

In 1886 two additional locomotives were introduced, built by Neilson and Company. == Design == Fell railway system, 20 March 2002. The locomotives worked on the Fell mountain railway system and had four horizontal driving wheels between the frames, gripping a centre rail and providing the extra adhesion needed for the climb. The outside engines drove the rear pair of coupled wheels of diameter, and the inside cylinders four spring-loaded grip wheels of diameter. On the descent, powerful hand-brakes bore against the centre rail, and brake vans with similar braking gear were interspersed at intervals in the train. The locomotives were never required to run at speeds higher than , and their usual operating speed was between ascending the incline, about descending. == Withdrawal == After the Second World War, the locomotives were starting to show their age, and the New Zealand government was looking for a way to cut the time between Wellington and the Wairarapa. On 7 May 1951, the contract to construct the Rimutaka Tunnel was let, which spelt the end of the incline, and the need for the H class. The last revenue service for the H class was on 29 October 1955, when locomotives 199, 201, 202, 203 and 204 hauled a Carterton Show day excursion train up the incline on the return journey to Wellington. When the Rimutaka Tunnel opened five days later, two of the engines were put to work dismantling the incline that they had travelled on for 77 years. After closure and dismantling of the line, in February 1956 all of the H Class - except H 200 which had been out of service for some time with a collapsed internal steam pipe - were towed to Hutt Workshops. All were written off in March 1956 and all except H 199 were towed to the old Silverstream rail yard in 1957 where they were scrapped. H 199 was towed to Featherston on 9 August 1958 by DE 508 (itself preserved) and put on display in the park in Clifford Square the following month. Years later the locomotive became the centrepiece in the Fell Locomotive Museum at Featherston. == Preservation == At the opening ceremony for the Rimutaka Tunnel on 3 November 1955, the then Minister of Railways John McAlpine gifted locomotive H 199 to the town of Featherston. Following dismantling the incline, H 199 was stored at the Hutt Workshops (Woburn) for three years, before being moved through the Rimutaka Tunnel to Featherston. The locomotive was placed on a concrete plinth in a children's playground. Over the years, exposure to the elements and vandalism had deteriorated the locomotive's condition. In 1980, the Friends of the Fell Society was formed with the intention of restoring H 199 for static display. Restoration began in 1981, and in 1984, the locomotive was moved into the new Fell Engine Museum adjacent to the playground. The restoration of the locomotive was completed in 1989. The society won the A & G Price Locomotive Restoration in 1990. == References ==  Bibliography  * * * ==External links== * New Zealand Steam Locomotives - Class H H class Category:0-4-2T locomotives Category:Avonside locomotives Category:Neilson locomotives Category:3 ft 6 in gauge locomotives of New Zealand Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1877 ","title":"NZR H class"},{"id":"5567582","text":"\\"Somebody Saved Me\\" is a song written and composed by Pete Townshend, the guitarist and principal songwriter for The Who.

It is above sea level. It was one of several fortresses built along the northern Urartian border and was one of the most important political, economic and cultural centers of the vast kingdom. The name Yerevan itself is derived from Erebuni. ==Etymology== On an inscription found at Karmir Blur, the Urartian verb erebu-ni is used in the sense of \\"to seize, pillage, steal, or kidnap\\" followed by a changing direct object. Scholars have conjectured that the word, as an unchanging direct object, may also mean \\"to take\\" or \\"to capture\\" and thus believe that the Erebuni at the time of its founding meant \\"capture\\", \\"conquest\\", or \\"victory.\\"Israelyan. Erebuni, pp. 12-13. The Circassian folklorist Amjad Jaimoukha gives an alternative etymology,Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Page 29. Available at Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=PnjAlei9fe0C&pg;=PA29&lpg;=PA29&dq;=Dvals+Nakh&source;=bl&ots;=cBdFzCg2sy&sig;=bdh7fSoSDfDFUb_DrlkA1PmpA6A&hl;=en&ei;=dn4bTMHAIYSBlAeZ593mCQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CCcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false however: eri (referring to the √àrs, a hypothetical people with no references in any historical record) + buni. According to Jamoukha, buni comes from the Nakh root which spawned the Chechen word bun meaning shelter or cabin; the root however simply means \\"lair\\" or \\"shelter\\" and has an Indo-European root. Chechen \\"bun\\" initially derives from the Armenian word buyn (’¢’∏÷Ç’µ’∂) for \\"nest\\" or \\"lair\\", from Proto-Indo-European *b ∞euH-no-, from *b ∞euH- (‚Äúto be; to grow‚Äù). Cognates include Sanskrit ‡§≠‡•Å‡§µ‡§® (bh√∫vana, \\"world\\"), Albanian bun (\\"shepherd's hut\\") and Middle Persian ÿ®ŸÜ bun (\\"bottom\\"). It may have spawned the word van in Armenian (a language with a strong Urartian substratum), which similarly means shelter. Van as a root is also present in numerous other placenames in historical Armenia, including the city Van, Lake Sevan, and Nakhichevan, so it is probable that the van in Yerevan is another direct translation of the root. Jaimoukha states furthermore that the name of the √àr also serves as the root for the Arax valley (the Erashki gorge) and for the Medieval Georgian name used in the Georgian Chronicles for Lake Sevan- \\"Lake Ereta\\". Jamoukha's theories are not widely accepted by any mainstream linguists, anthropologists, or historians. ==History== Modern reproductions of the ancient wall-paintings at Erebuni Fortress. Erebuni was founded by Urartian King Argishti I (r. ca. 785-753 BC) in 782 BC. It was built on top of a hill called Arin Berd overlooking the Aras River Valley to serve as a military stronghold to protect the kingdom's northern borders.Barnett, R. D. \\"Urartu\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 1. John Boardman et al. (eds.) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982, p. 345. It has been described as being \\"designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.\\" According to Margarit Israelyan, Argishti began the construction of Erebuni after conquering the territories north of Yerevan and west of Lake Sevan, roughly corresponding to where the town of Abovyan is currently located. Accordingly, the prisoners he captured in these campaigns, both men and women, were used to help build his town.Israelyan. Erebuni, pp. 139-140. In the autumn of 1950, an archaeological expedition led by Konstantine Hovhannisyan discovered an inscription at Arin Berd dedicated to the city's founding which was carved during Argishti's reign. Two other identical inscriptions have been found at the citadel of Erebuni. The inscription reads: Argishti left a similar inscription at the Urartian capital of Tushpa (current-day Van) as well, stating that he brought 6,600 prisoners of war from Khate and Tsupani to populate his new city. Hovhannisyan, Konstantine. ¬´’ß÷Ä’•’¢’∏÷Ç’∂’´¬ª (Erebuni). Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. vol. iv. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1979, pp. 90-91. Similar to other Urartian cities of the time, it was built on a triangular plan on top of a hill and ensconced by high ramparts. Behind them, the buildings were separated by central and inner walls. The walls were built from a variety of materials, including basalt, tuff, wood and adobe. Argishti constructed a grand palace here and excavations conducted in the area have revealed that other notable buildings included a colonnaded royal assembly hall, a temple dedicated to Khaldi, a citadel, where the garrison resided, living quarters, dormitories and storerooms. The inner walls were richly decorated with murals and other wall paintings, displaying religious and secular scenes.Chahin. The Kingdom of Armenia, pp. 158-160. Successive Urartian kings made Erebuni their place of residence during their military campaigns against northern invaders and continued construction work to build up the fortress defences. Kings Sarduri II and Rusa I also utilized Erebuni as a staging site for new campaigns of conquest directed towards the north.Israelyan. Erebuni, pp. 137-138. In the early sixth century the Urartian state, under constant foreign invasion, collapsed. The region soon fell under the control of the Achaemenian Empire. The strategic position that Erebuni occupied did not diminish, however, becoming an important center of the satrapy of Armenia. Despite numerous invasions by successive foreign powers, the city was never truly abandoned and was continually inhabited over the following centuries, eventually branching out to become the city of Yerevan. Erebuni's close affinity to Yerevan was celebrated in a splendid festival held in September 1968, commemorating Erebuni's 2,750th birthday. == Architecture == Exterior walls of Erebuni The site of Erebuni Fortress was atop the tall hill of Arin Berd as a strategic position overlooking the Ararat plain and the main roads leading to the citadel. It also overlooked cramped Urartian town made up of residences below at the foot of the hill. The main entrance to the fortress was located at the more gently sloped southeastern site of the hill. It led to the central yard of the citadel. Ceremonies held by the personal guards of Argishti I and guards of the fortress garrison were held here. In the southwest portion of the yard was a temple of the god Khaldi. The temple had a large oblong plan with a staircase that led to the roof of a ziggurat type tower and a side room on the lower floor. Surrounding the hall was a double-rowed twelve-column open portico with benches along the walls. An altar for sacrifices was located at the left wall. The walls were decorated with colorful frescoes depicting representations of human figures, gods, geometric and floral designs. One of the frescoes uncovered depicts the god Khaldi standing on a lion with a warder in his left hand and a horned crown upon his head. It is typical of other representations of Khaldi found at other sites. The floor of the temple contrasted greatly from the rest of the complex in that it had wood floors composed of small planks, compared to the clay-coated adobe floors that were faced with stone slabs found in the rest of the citadel's rooms. ==Excavations== Early excavations began during the 19th century while more systematic excavations were carried out at Erebuni in 1952, under the joint sponsorship of the Armenian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography and the Pushkin Museum's Board for the Preservation and Restoration of Architectural Monuments. The team was led by Konstantine Hovhannisyan and Boris Piotrovsky, who served as an on-site adviser. Hovhannisyan, Konstantine. ¬´‘±÷Ä’´’∂ ‘≤’•÷Ä’§¬ª (Arin Berd). Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. vol. ii. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1976, p. 60. In the course of the early stage of the excavations (1950-1968), Argishti's palace, the royal assembly hall, temples and over a hundred rooms were excavated. Dozens of Urartian and Achaemenian artifacts, such as pottery, earthenware, belt-buckles, bracelets, beads, drinking vessels, helmets, arrows and silver coins, were also uncovered. The fragments of murals that were uncovered were found to be decorated with important religious themes, including \\"processions of gods, sacred animals, and trees of life\\", as well as scenes of everyday life, displaying scenes of \\"hunting, cattle breeding, and agriculture.\\"Chahin. The Kingdom of Armenia, p. 118. Storage areas for grain, oil, and wine were also uncovered. On the doors of the storage areas inscriptions were placed at the entry doors telling the who built the storage area and the quantity of the items placed in them. One such inscription reads: The enormous ceramic jars that held the wine and oil had markings upon them. Smaller ceramic vessels were also found in excavations and are known to have been used in brewing beer made from barley. Other much larger vessels were used for storing foods and wine. Small circular markings on the sides of these containers near the top indicated the amount that could be stored inside. The larger of the vessels were usually buried half-way into the soil which naturally kept the contents cool. Numerous cuneiform inscriptions carved on basalt have been found around the complex. Some of which are currently displayed in the museum, while others can still be found displayed on the walls. In 1968 the Erebuni Museum of History was established. Its opening was timed to coincide with the 2750th anniversary of Yerevan. The museum houses items uncovered during the excavations at Arin Berd and Karmir Blur and gives a history of the site. == Gallery == Image:Maquette of the Erebuni fortress2.jpgModel of the Erebuni Fortress Image:Erebuni SE Entrance.JPG Image:Erebuni Fortress, Yerevan, Armenia 05.JPG Image:Erebuni Walls Yerevan.JPGInterior walls of the citadel and Yerevan below Image:Erebuni105.jpgSusi Temple Image:2014 Erywa≈Ñ, Erebuni, Ruiny twierdzy (01).jpg Image:2014 Erywa≈Ñ, Erebuni, Ruiny twierdzy (04).jpg ==See also== *Teishebaini == Notes Further reading== * Israelyan, Margarit A. ‘∑÷Ä’•’¢’∏÷Ç’∂’´: ‘≤’•÷Ä’§-’î’°’≤’°÷Ñ’´ ’ä’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂ (Erebuni: The History of a Fortress-City).

Gregan McMahon, CBE (2 March 1874 ‚Äì 30 August 1941)Allan Ashbolt, 'McMahon, Gregan (1874‚Äì1941)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 10, MUP, 1986, pp 336‚Äì337. Retrieved 2 October 2009 was an Australian actor and theatrical director and producer. ==Early life == McMahon was born in Sydney, elder son of John Terence McMahon, a clerk, and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Gregan. Both parents were emigrants from Ireland. McMahon was educated at Sydney Grammar School and St Ignatius' College, Riverview. McMahon played in the Riverview football team, and took first-class honours in classics at his matriculation examination. McMahon graduated with a BA at the University of Sydney in 1896 and during his course, established a reputation as an amateur actor ‚Äì a critic on one occasion spoke of his performance being so artistic that he seemed like a professional in a company of amateurs. ==Career == After university, McMahon was articled to a firm of solicitors at Sydney, and remained there for some years. On 4 October 1899 McMahon married Mary Kate, daughter of Thomas Hungerford. In May 1900 he was invited by Robert Brough to join his comedy company. His first professional appearance was as the waiter in The Liars at Brisbane in the beginning of June, and during the next 12 months he toured India and China playing a variety of small parts. Returning to Australia McMahon played with the William Hawtrey and Brough companies, and, by 1902 he was more important roles, including that of \\"Horace Parker\\", in A Message from Mars. McMahon's establishment of the Melbourne Repertory Theatre Company (of which he was artistic director from 1911‚Äì1918 and 1926‚Äì1928) as an artistically and financially successful company is seen by some as the first Australian theatre company.Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director. University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p38. Seasons followed in New Zealand and Australia, largely in companies under the J. C. Williamson management. Early in 1911 McMahon, who had been playing in Melbourne, organised a repertory theatre movement. The first performances took place in June, the plays selected being St John Hankin's The Two Mr Wetherbys, the second act of Sheridan's The Critic, and Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman. Among the plays McMahon produced from 1911‚Äì1917 were Candida, Getting Married, Major Barbara, The Doctor's Dilemma, Man and Superman, Fanny's First Play, You Never Can Tell, and Pygmalion, all by George Bernard Shaw; Rosmersholm and An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen; The Voysey Inheritance and The Madras House by Granville Barker; The Pigeon, Strife and The Fugitive by Galsworthy; The Seagull by Anton Chekhov; The Mate by Arthur Schnitzler, and many other plays by leading dramatists of the period, including several by Australian authors. McMahon is also seen as having brought the techniques and approaches of the Russian and Soviet theatre practitioners like Stanislavski and Meyerhold to Australian theatre. World War I had a significant effect on theatre and several leading actors enlisted. After the war McMahon returned to the professional stage and acted as producer for Williamson and other managers. In 1920 he arranged with the Messrs Tait to start a repertory movement in Sydney. This was carried on for several years, the productions including The Dover Road by Milne; Abraham Lincoln by John Drinkwater; Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman; Franz Molnar's Liliom; Galsworthy's Foundations, Loyalties, and Windows; and many others. With the break-up of the Sydney Repertory Theatre, the Sydney Players' Club was formed from its members, notably W. F. Jackson and S. R. Irving.Sydney Morning Herald 18 March 1937 Another notable alumnus was Doris Fitton, who went on to found the Independent Theatre. In Melbourne in 1929 McMahon revived the repertory movement under the \\"Gregan McMahon Players\\" and in 11 years placed about 90 plays on the stage, including several of the later Shaw plays; Pirandello's Right You Are and Six Characters in Search of an Author; several plays by James Bridie; and others by Galsworthy, Drinkwater, W. Somerset Maugham, G. K. Chesterton, Eugene O'Neill, Se√°n O'Casey, Daviot and Casella, in the presentation of which a generally high standard was reached. In spite of difficulties caused by war breaking out again, McMahon was still keeping up his standard of production when he died suddenly on 30 August 1941. ==Personal life and honours == McMahon was survived by his wife, Mary Hungerford McMahon, whom he had married in 1899, and a son (also named Gregan McMahon) and a daughter. He was created CBE in 1938. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Australian male stage actors Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:People from Sydney Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:People educated at Sydney Grammar School Category:People educated at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview ","title":"Gregan McMahon"},{"id":"5567639","text":"Wayside is an unincorporated community located along the border of Tinton Falls Borough and Ocean Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States.Locality Search, State of New Jersey.

He was the son of Godfrey I, Count of Namur and Ermesinde, a daughter of Conrad I of Luxembourg. He inherited the counties of La Roche and Durbuy from his cousins Henry II of Durbuy and Henry of Laroche. When another cousin, Conrad II of Luxembourg, died he was granted that county by the Emperor Lothair II, who thus prevented its passing to the French count of Grandpr√©. At the same time he also inherited the advocacies of the abbeys of Saint-Maximin at Trier and Saint-Willibrord at Echternach. This was the cause of many conflicts with Albero of Montreuil, archbishop of Trier. Three years later, he inherited Namur from his father. In 1141, he helped Alberon II, Bishop of Li√®ge take Bouillon with Renaut I of Bar. In 1147, he gave up Saint-Maximin, but he regained it on the death of Archbishop Albero de Montreuil in 1152. The new archbishop, Hillin of Falmagne, exchanged the rights over the abbeys with the town of Grevenmacher in 1155. In 1157, he married Laurette (d.1175), daughter of Thierry of Alsace, Count of Flanders, and Margaret of Clermont. They separated in 1163. Left without child, he designated his brother-in-law Baldwin IV of Hainault, husband of his sister Alice of Namur, as his heir. When Baldwin died in 1171, he designated Baldwin V. Baldwin V and Henry carried out two wars, in 1170 and 1172, with Henry III of Limburg. In 1171, Henry married a second time, this time to Agnes, daughter of Henry I, Count of Guelders and Agnes of Arnstein. Heirless still, he repudiated her in 1184, but fell seriously ill and rejoined her. In September 1186, a girl, Ermesinde, was born to them. This birth called into question the plan of succession, as Henry considered his promise to Baldwin null and void. Henry, then 76 years old, pledged his daughter in marriage to Henry II of Champagne. Baldwin still claimed his inheritance. It was then decided that Baldwin would inherit Namur, Ermesinde would inherit Durbuy and La Roche, and Luxembourg (fief masculin) would revert to the Empire. The fiefs were dispensed in 1189. After the planned marriage between Ermesinde and the count of Champagne was cancelled, Henry betrothed her instead to Theobald I of Bar. He entered into a war with Henry of Limburg and was defeated on 1 August 1194 at Noville-sur-Mehaigne.

It is based on the byliny tales of the bogatyr (Knight) Ilya Muromets. ==Plot== In medieval Russia, the aging giant bogatyr Svyatogor gives his sword to some traveling pilgrims to be passed on to a new bogatyr. Svyatogor and his horse become a mountain as he dies. Meanwhile, Asiatic pagans known as the Tugars are ravaging and pillaging the land. They raid the village where the bearded and robust Ilya Muromets lives and capture his future wife Vassilisa. Ilya is unable to defend her because his legs haven't worked since childhood. A man called Mishatychka caught by the Tugars pleads to serve them if they spare him, and promises to be a double agent for them. The pilgrims with Svyatogor's sword come upon the house of Ilya Muromets and cure his ailment with a magical potion and a magical song. They also give him the sword. Later on, he decides to leave his family to go on an epic journey in order to defend Kiev from the Tugars. For this purpose he is given a foal by a neighbour (Mikula Selyaninovich) which magically grows into a steed in three days. He passes by some woods and is confronted by a forest- dwelling monster known as Nightingale the Robber who blows wind so hard it parts the forest backward; Ilya defeats him by throwing a cudgel at him. Meanwhile, in the capital Kiev, a peasant named Razumey stands trial before Knyaz Vladimir the Fair Sun, for cutting trees without permission. Upon hearing that Razumey's purpose was designing and building weapons to use against the enemy, Vladimir releases him and provides him with wood to continue the work. Ilya arrives in Kiev and presents the forest monster to Knyaz Vladimir, who is impressed with his deeds. Ilya becomes part of a bogatyr brotherhood with two other bogatyrs Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich. A Tugar envoy arrives in the city, Idolishche Poganoye, a huge zeppelin-like man on a massive moving platform, who warns the Knyaz to give a tribute for twelve years in advance and they will be spared. Ilya replies by insulting the ambassador, and, when he throws a sword at Ilya, throwing it back into the ambassador's stomach, cutting him down while the envoy runs off. Ilya leaves Kiev and finds Vassilisa captured by three Tugars and releases her. After a while Ilya departs from the pregnant Vassilisa to fight the Turgars. Upon leaving he expresses his wish for her to bear a son, to be called Sokolnichek (Little Falcon), who will become a heroic warrior. Unfortunately Vassilisa is abducted again by the Tugars. Mishatychka has become an important adviser to the knyaz and he tricks the knyaz into believing that Ilya is disloyal to him. Ilya is imprisoned in the castle's dungeons where he will eventually spend ten years deprived of food by Mishatychka. Disgusted, Nikitich and Popovich leave the knyaz's court. Mishatychka attempts to send the dungeon key to Kalin, but instead, it falls into Razumey's hands. Vassilisa has born a son, Sokolnichek, while in captivity of Tsar Kalin, the Tugar Khan. Kalin adopts Sokolnichek as his own son and has him trained as a mighty Tugar warrior. The huge Tugar army sets up camp outside the city of Kiev, demanding an enormous ransom (700 carts of gold) to be given to Kalin in order for the city to be spared. Ilya is released, having survived on food provided by a magic table cloth that Vassilisa had woven previously. Mishatychka the traitor is rooted out and ordered to be boiled in pitch, while Vladimir calls out for all the Rus' warriors to assemble for a battle the Tugar hordes. Nikitich and Popovich, hearing of Ilya's release, hurry back into Kiev. Due to the reinforcements being slow to arrive, Ilya hatches a plan to trick Kalin by using torn sacks and broken carts to create the impression that all of the gold being paid as tribute fell out during transport, and then make Kalin think the warriors tried to keep the treasure for themselves. After they warriors give Kalin the treasure (their own jewelry), the king demands to give him Ilya as well. Ilya sends people to Kiev, and they naturally come back empty handed. Kalin then promises to depart if Ilya is delivered. Ilya reveals himself to Kalin who feels insulted by this deception, captures Ilya and decides to attack Kiev anyway; Ilya escapes and goes back to Kiev. With all the aforementioned manipulations, enough time has passed for the Rus' armies to arrive. Sokolnichek is now a strong Tugar warrior who is sent to fight Ilya. While they duel, Ilya sees the ring on his son's finger and reveals his true heritage to him. Abashed, he joins his father's side and goes to free Vassilisa, together with all the Russians held captive by Kalin. Nikitich and Popovich each lead one army with Ilya leading the center army toward the Tugar hordes and Vladimir with his personal guard stands ready as reserve. The Khan orders a massive pyramid to be made out of human bodies so that he can survey the forthcoming battle. An arrow is shot from inside Kiev by a large ballista designed and operated by Razumey, causing Kalin to tumble down. Angry, Kalin orders to release the three-headed dragon, Zmey Gorynych, to help in the fight. Another arrow from the ballista hits the dragon in the wing, forcing it to fight on the ground. More of the Russian soldiers land from ships from a nearby river and fight the fire-breathing dragon, eventually slaying it. The Tugar hordes are routed and Kalin captured. The victorious Ilya is finally reunited with Vassilisa and offered a place at the court and a title by Vladimir, but declines in order to be with his wife and go on other journeys. He gives the title and his sword to his son, who continues the heroic lineage. ==Cast== * Boris Andreyev ‚Äì Ilya Muromets * Ninel Myshkova ‚Äì Vassilisa * Shukur Burkhanov ‚Äì Tsar Kalin * Andrey Abrikosov ‚Äì Prince Vladimir * Natalya Medvedeva ‚Äì Princess Apraksia * Aleksander Shvorin ‚Äì Sokolnichek (20 years) * Sergey Martinson ‚Äì Mishatychka * Sergey Stolyarov ‚Äì Alyosha Popovich * Iya Arepina ‚Äì Alyonushka * Mikhail Pugovkin ‚Äì Razumey * Muratbek Ryskulov ‚Äì Nevryui Monsters besides Nightingale the Robber and the dragon Zmey Gorynych, are Idolishche Poganoye and Likho the One-Eyed.

This version featured narration by Mike Wallacecredits on US release print and the voice of the Khan was dubbed by well-known voice actor Paul Frees . Corman's version of the film was featured as an episode on Mystery Science Theater 3000 as The Sword and the Dragon. Presumably because of its strong resemblance to the Russo-Finnish co- production Sampo, which they used in its American version \\"The Day the Earth Froze\\", the staff of MST3K mistook the film's nation of origin to be Finland, and filled the episode with jokes about the Finnish. *The first Soviet movie filmed in CinemaScope with a 4-track Stereo soundmix. ==Comic book adaption== * Dell Four Color #1118 (June 1960) ==See Also== *Alexander Nevsky (film) *Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film) ==References External links == * * Ilya Muromets online at official Mosfilm site * * * Review of Krupnyy Plan DVD Category:1956 films Category:1950s fantasy films Category:Films based on Russian folklore Category:Films based on Slavic mythology Category:Mosfilm films Category:Sword and sorcery films Category:Soviet films Category:Films directed by Aleksandr Ptushko Category:Russian-language films Category:Films about dragons Category:Russian children's fantasy films Category:Films adapted into comics Category:Cultural depictions of Vladimir the Great Category:Kievan Rus in fiction Category:Films about giants Category:Films_based_on_fairy_tales Category:Soviet epic films Category:Soviet war films ","title":"Ilya Muromets (film)"},{"id":"5567715","text":"Sutiyoso (born 6 December 1944 in Semarang, Central Java) is an Indonesian politician and former general who was the Director of the State Intelligence Agency from 8 July 2015 - 9 September 2016. Known informally as 'Bang Yos', he was the governor of Jakarta, the country's capital, during a turbulent period from 1997. During this time there was a total of five presidents in Indonesia (Suharto, B. J. Habibie, Gus Dur Wahid, Megawati, and SBY). The transitions between presidents were often accompanied by much turmoil and disturbance in the streets of Jakarta. Sutiyoso also served as chairman of the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) for the period 2004‚Äì2008. He is particularly known for his work in supporting the introduction, in early 2000, of the TransJakarta, a bus rapid transit system, in Jakarta. It is widely agreed that better public transport arrangements are badly needed in Jakarta so the introduction of the TransJakarta system was seen as an important initiative. However it has not proved easy to ensure that the TransJakarta bus system works well so the arrangements are currently regarded as being of mixed success. Sutiyoso announced he was standing for the presidency of Indonesia in the 2009 and 2014 election but failed to get enough support to win the nomination. He was also chairman of the Indonesian Justice and Unity Party between 2010‚Äì2015. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Profile at TokohIndonesia Category:1944 births Category:Governors of Jakarta Category:People from Semarang Category:Living people Category:Indonesian generals Category:Badminton in Indonesia Category:Javanese people Category:Indonesian Muslims ","title":"Sutiyoso"},{"id":"5567751","text":"\\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\\" is a 1968 popular song written and composed for singer Dionne Warwick by Burt Bacharach. Hal David wrote the lyrics. The song was Warwick's biggest international hit to that point, selling several million copies worldwide and winning Warwick her first Grammy Award. David's lyrics tell the story of a native of San Jose, California, who, having failed to break into the entertainment field in Los Angeles, is set to return to her hometown. The song was released on the 1968 RIAA Certified Gold album Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls. \\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\\" was issued as the follow-up single to the double-sided hit \\"(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls\\"/ \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" in April 1968. It became Warwick's third consecutive top ten song in the closing months of 1967 and into 1968, punctuating the most successful period of her recording career. The song peaked at No. 8 in the UK, Ireland, and Canada. It also charted highly in France, Italy, South Africa, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Lebanon, Japan, and many other countries throughout the world. The single was one of the most successful of Warwick's international hits, selling over 3,500,000 copies worldwide. The flip-side of the single, \\"Let Me Be Lonely\\", also penned by Bacharach/David, charted in the Billboard Hot 100 as well and became one of many double-sided hits for Warwick. ==Production== Bacharach had composed the music for the song before David wrote its lyrics. David had a special interest in San Jose, having been stationed there while in the Navy. The track was the last Dionne Warwick single to be recorded at New York City's Bell Studios. It features a prominent use of bass drum, played by session musician Gary Chester. The engineer was Ed Smith, who devised the famous introduction to the tune by directly attaching a mike to the head of Chester's bass drum. Warwick did not like \\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\\", and she had to be convinced to record it. In a May 1983 interview with Ebony, she said: \\"It's a dumb song and I didn't want to sing it. But it was a hit, just like [her recent Top Ten hit] 'Heartbreaker' is. I'm happy these songs were successful, but that still doesn't change my opinion about them.\\" Though she still does not like it, the song remains one of Warwick's most popular chart selections, and she still includes it in almost every concert she performs. ==Awards== Warwick won her first Grammy, the 1969 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, for \\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\\". She told Jet in May 2002 that winning this award was the overall highlight of her career. ==Chart performance== {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" - ! colspan=\\"8\\"Weekly singles charts - !

Warwick re-recorded the song as a salsa-flavored collaboration with Celia Cruz and the Pete Escovedo Orchestra for her 1998 album Dionne Sings Dionne. The song has been recorded on various Burt Bacharach tribute albums, including by Medeski Martin & Wood on Great Jewish Music: Burt Bacharach (1997), by both Yazz and Dionne Warwick (separately) on Tribute to Burt Bacharach & Hal David (2002), by Trijntje Oosterhuis on The Look of Love (2006), and by Kahimi Karie on All Kinds of People ~Love Burt Bacharach~ (2010). In 1977, Maureen McCormick, Geri Reischl and Susan Olsen performed the song during a medley on an episode of The Brady Bunch Variety Hour. ==In other media== *During the early and mid-1990s, San Jose-based KNTV used the first notes of the song in its news theme. *In 1968 through 1969, the Chrysler-Dodge Corporation used the tune to promote the Dodge Challenger and Charger in television commercials airing in the USA and Canada. *In the film The Scout, the character played by Brendan Fraser listens to the song on headphones while flying and disturbs other flyers by singing it off-key. *The song was one of many California-related songs played throughout \\"Sunshine Plaza\\" in the original Disney California Adventure. *The song opens and closes the pilot episode of Helix, in each case playing over tense scenes featuring Peter Farragut. The song appears again in the opener of Helix Season 2 when Julia arrives to the island. *The San Jose Earthquakes play the song after each home game at Earthquakes Stadium. *The song was parodied on an episode of MadTV entitled \\"Ebay\\" based on eBay commercials with the lyrics \\"Do you know the way to use eBay?\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1967 songs Category:1968 singles Category:Dionne Warwick songs Category:Celia Cruz songs Category:Frankie Goes to Hollywood songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Hal David Category:Songs with music by Burt Bacharach Category:Scepter Records singles Category:Songs about Los Angeles Category:Songs about California Category:Songs about cities in the United States Category:Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance ","title":"Do You Know the Way to San Jose"},{"id":"5567795","text":"The following terms are used in water polo.

Also called a stop. ;setting a screen (or pick) :An offense player is positioned to allow his/her teammate to swim by, while blocking or delaying his/her defender. ;setting the ball :To pass the ball into the center forward, ideally just out of reach of his/her defender, allowing the center to lunge for the ball and sweep it into the goal with a backhand or power shot. ;shot clock :A clock at each corner of the pool deck counting down (from 30 seconds) the time remaining for a team to take a shot. Also known as the possession clock. Defender (2) is sinking attacker with the ball ;sink :To push an opposing player under the water, an exclusion foul if the player is not holding the ball and is in a position of offensive advantage. ;skip shot :An outside water shot executed by throwing the ball at an angle directly into the water. If done properly and with enough force, the ball will skip off the water into the goal, since the goalkeeper cannot easily anticipate the angle. Also called a bounce shot. ;slough :A defensive perimeter player intentionally causes an ordinary foul and then moves toward the goal, away from his/her attacker, who must take a free throw. This tactic allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the hole set and possibly steal the inbound pass. Also called foul and in or foul and drop. ;spring shot :An inside water shot executed by pushing the ball slightly into the water (but avoiding a ball under foul) and then allowing a sudden release, and a soft tap-in to beat the goalkeeper.Swimoff or sprint to begin play ;sprint : At the start of each period, teams line up on their own goal line. At the referee's whistle, both teams swim to midpoint of the field, where the referee drops the ball. The first team to recover the ball begins their offense. ;stalling :Failing to take a shot within 30 seconds or intentional delay in advancing the ball results in a turnover. ;steal :A steal occurs when a defensive player or goalkeeper legally causes a turnover by his/her positive, aggressive action(s). ;swim off :See sprint. ;switch :Players change defensive assignments to cover a teammate who has fallen behind an opponent, or to match up better with an offensive player in size or speed. ==T== ;tee shot :Executed by scooping the ball with the non-dominant hand, loading the ball to the dominant hand, and propelling the ball forward. The off-hand sets itself up as a tee, as in golf or baseball, and the two hands also finish in the shape of a \\"T\\". ;timeout :Each team may call two 60 second timeouts in the four periods of regulation play, and one timeout if the game goes into overtime. During game play, only the team in possession of the ball may call a timeout. ;tube water polo :See inner tube water polo ;turn a defender :An offensive move to get by an opponent using leverage or strength. The result is a 180 degree turn, where the defender is \\"wheeled\\" around, resulting in the attacking player possessing inside-water, or position towards the goal, with the defender trailing behind. This maneuver often results in the defender being forced to foul. ;turnover :A team loses possession of the ball, which reverts to the opponent, as a result of a foul or possession for more than 30 seconds without a shot on goal. ==U== ;utility player :A player skilled at several offensive or defensive roles, often coming off the bench for substitutions. ; USA Water Polo : The National Governing Body (NGB) for the sport of water polo in the United States. ==V== ;V-cut :Offensive player cuts in and quickly out of the defender's area, pushing off of the defender to increase speed; making the letter \\"V\\" . Also called \\"V-out\\". ==W== Attacker (7 white) walking in the ball ;walk it in :The attacker grips the ball in one hand and either eggbeaters or strokes in toward the goal. ;weak side :When an offensive player has possession of the ball on one side of the playing area (the strong side), the opposite side is called the weak side. Players will shout \\"weak\\" to notify a teammate with the ball that they are open on the other side of the pool. boxing out her defender ;wet pass :A deliberate pass into the water, just out of reach of the intended teammate and their defender. The receiving player can then lunge towards the ball and out of the water to make a shot or pass. ;white ball :Shouted to teammates when white cap team has possession. ;wing :The position on offense on either side of the center forward, along the 2 meter line. Players at this position may set screens for the drivers, recover rebounds, and shift laterally or toward the half-distance line to spread out the defenders. More generally, the wing is a player or location to either side of the center of the playing area. To move toward the side of the pool to get open for a pass is to wing out. ==Y== ;yellow card :Shown by the referee to indicate that a coach, substitute, or bench personnel has been officially cautioned for misconduct, but may continue participating in the game. If a person receives a second yellow card caution, it has the effect of receiving a red card, and the individual must leave the playing area for the rest of the match. Players out of the water are not show a yellow card in Water Polo. ==Z== ;zone :Defensive arrangement in which players are assigned to defend an area, rather than a specific opponent. ==See also== *History of water polo *List of water polo organizations *Water polo ==NotesExternal links== * Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) * USA Water Polo Water polo ","title":"Glossary of water polo"},{"id":"5567808","text":"David Botstein (born 8 September 1942) is an American biologist serving as the chief scientific officer of Calico.

He started his Ph.D. work under Maurice Sanford Fox at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then moved and received a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1967 for work on P22 phage. ==Career== Botstein taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he became a professor of genetics. Botstein joined Genentech, Inc. in 1987 as vice president ‚Äì science. In 1990, he became chairman of the Department of Genetics at Stanford University. Botstein was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1981 and to the Institute of Medicine in 1993. Botstein is the director of the Integrated Science Program at Princeton University. Many Integrated Science students have gone on to be successful in the field of molecular biology. In 1980, Botstein and his colleagues Ray White, Mark Skolnick, and Ronald W. Davis proposed a method for constructing a genetic linkage map using restriction fragment length polymorphisms that was used in subsequent years to identify several human disease genes including Huntington's and BRCA1. Variations of this method were used in the mapping efforts that predated and enabled the sequencing phase of the Human Genome Project. In 1998, Botstein and his postdoctoral fellow Michael Eisen, together with graduate student Paul Spellman and colleague Patrick Brown, developed a statistical method and graphical interface that is widely used to interpret genomic data including microarray data. This approach was refined and applied for diverse applications, including for a molecular classification of heterogenous tumors using gene expression. These efforts included work on discovery of tumor subtypes with Lou Staudt, Ash Alizadeh and Ronald Levy, yielding a refined classification of diffuse large B cell lymphomas, and in painting the molecular portraits for refined classification of breast cancers with Anne-Lise B√∏rresen-Dale and Charles Perou. He has subsequently worked on the creation of the influential Gene Ontology with Michael Ashburner and Suzanna Lewis. He is one of the founding editors of the journal Molecular Biology of the Cell, along with Erkki Ruoslahti and Keith Yamamoto. In 2013, Botstein was named Chief Scientific Officer of Google's anti-aging health startup Calico. ==Awards== Botstein has won the Eli Lilly and Company Award in Microbiology (1978), the Genetics Society of America Medal (1988, with Ira Herskowitz), the Allan Award of the American Society of Human Genetics (1989, with Ray White), the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2003), the Albany Medical Center Prize (2010, with Eric Lander and Francis Collins) and the Dan David Prize in 2012. In 2013 he was awarded the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his work and in 2020 the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal of the Genetics Society of America. In 2016, Semantic Scholar AI program included Botstein on its list of most top ten most influential biomedical researchers. ==Personal== Botstein is an alumnus of Camp Rising Sun.

The governor of Jakarta is an elected politician who, along with the vice governor and 106 members of the Regional People's Representative Council (DPRD), is accountable for the strategic government of the city of Jakarta. ==Background== Governing system of Jakarta has changed throughout its history. On March 5, 1942, Japanese occupied Batavia from the Dutch control and the city was named Jakarta (, in accordance with the special status that was assigned to the city). After the collapse of Japan, Indonesian nationalists who declared independence on August 17, 1945, the government of Jakarta City was changed from the Japanese into the Jakarta National Administration in September 1945. After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognized until full Indonesian independence was achieved on December 27, 1949 and Jakarta was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia. Based on the Act No. 5 of 1974 relating to the Fundamentals of Regional Government, Jakarta was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of Indonesia's 26 provinces. ==Elections== This first government was held by a mayor until the end of 1960, when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Sudiro, until he was replaced by Dr Sumarno as governor of the province. In August 2007, Jakarta held its first ever election to choose a governor, whereas previously the city's governors were elected by members of DPRD. The poll is part of a country-wide decentralisation drive, allowing for direct local elections in several areas. Elections for governor and deputy governor are held for a fixed five-year term. Most recent election The most recent election was held in Jakarta on 15 February 2017. There were 3 contesting pairs in that election, but no one obtained 50% of the vote. As per law, a runoff election was held between the top two pairs on 19 April 2017. The official results of the election is Anies Baswedan - Sandiaga Uno won the election with 57.96% of vote defeating Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - Djarot Saiful Hidayat, who got 42.04% of the vote.http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2017/04/20/21125081/hasil.final.real.count.kpu.anies- sandi.57.95.ahok-djarot.42.05. ==List of governors == Below is a list of Mayors and Governors who have held office in the regional government district of Batavia in the Dutch East Indies until its transformation to Jakarta in Indonesia from the formation of the office in 1916.

Following the power transfer, President of Indonesia appointed Suwirjo as the Mayor of Jakarta on 23 September 1945.

Bogaardt had been the mayor of Batavia previously in 1941, and lost his power to the Japanese in 1942. The Dutch appointed Bogaardt in a shadow government and referred the de facto major, Suwiryo, as republikeinse burgemeester. Bogaardt's successor, E. M. Stok, finally gained de facto control after the Dutch occupied the city in Operation Product on 21 July 1947. There were four mayors of the city during this period, but only one was recognized as a definitive mayor, while the rest was referred as waarnemend burgemeester (acting mayor). {   center; background:#ffffef; float:center;\\" !No !Image !Name !Took office !Left office !Time in office - - 100px Archibald Theodoor Bogaardt 30 November 1946 28 June 1947 '''' - -  100px Elbert Marinus Stok 28 June 1947 26 August 1948 '''' - 1  Robert Thomas Praaning 26 August 1948 20 April 1949  - - 100px Sastromoeljono 20 April 1949 30 March 1950 '''' }  Governor of the Federal Region of Batavia (1948‚Äì1950)  The formation of the Federal Region of Batavia was announced with the Staatsblad No. 63 in June 1948.

Olinekova, whom Sports Illustrated nicknamed the \\"Greatest Legs To Ever Stride The Earth,\\" challenged the perception of femininity and athleticism during a time period when Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on gender in school athletics, was first going into effect. Olinekova encouraged fellow female athletes to embrace a muscular physique by publicly declaring that strength is beauty. ==Biography== Early life She wouldn't take the bus to school. The Toronto native would race the bus on foot (even on the coldest of mornings) just for the chance to stay in her warm bed ten minutes longer. But she had no dreams of becoming a world-class runner... at least, not yet. In her early days, Gayle Olinek (only later changed back to Olinekova as it had been in the Ukraine), dreamed of being a concert pianist. Even at the age of five, she thrived on the rigorous discipline music required. Still, she delighted in being the fastest kid on the block‚Äîfaster, even, than the older boys. She was 10 when a shoe salesman in a large store had her try on every knee boot he had in her size before finally giving up because none could get over her calves. Her family was embarrassed by her legs, suggesting she hide them as they wondered aloud which of their Ukrainian ancestors had provided the genes for such an embarrassment, but Olinekova promised, \\"Someday people will pay to see these legs.\\" As a child, she was described as being a serious girl and a bit of a loner. She held a paper route to earn money for her music lessons until, around the age of fifteen, Olinekova decided to pour all that discipline into running. First competitions \\"On Christmas Eve, 1968, I promised myself that I would go for it. I loved to run and decided to put all my energies into that. I didn't even own a pair of running shoes.\\" At 15, still wearing sweat pants to hide her legs during workouts, she ran a 62-second quarter mile in her first real competition; it broke the Toronto girls' high school record by 10 seconds. Eight months later in June 1969, she was named to the Canadian national team. Thinking back on her first victory, Olinekova said, \\"I remember climbing onto the victory podium to get my bronze metal and thinking, 'Now I really have to learn how to train.'\\" But she trained too hard and contracted mononucleosis. In her own words, training \\"took longer than I ever expected. Injury and mononucleosis from overtraining with my first two coaches made me realize that my overwhelming desire and effort were not enough.\\" It wasn't until two years later, in the spring of 1971, that she regained her strength. The Pan Am Games were coming up in July, and Olinekova went to the trials. She finished a strong second in the 800. But the Canadian authorities decided to send the woman who was third. They said her record was more consistent than Olinekova's. College Olinekova put sprinting on hold and used a scholarship to enroll at Ryerson Polytechnic Institute, where she studied modern dance, according to her book. (However, A Sports Illustrated article cites her as having studied journalism for a semester.) \\"I had never danced anything in my life except a polka at my gradparents' fiftieth wedding anniversary,\\" she explains in her 1982 book, Go For It!, \\"but the audition for this program was so crowded (476 hopefuls for 30 spots) I felt that there was nothing to lose. I was no match for all those nascent prima ballerinas, but I made it. The dance master said I was different and new, with a style all my own.\\" It was through this program that Olinekova first realized that \\"moving your body could feel... beautiful and sensual.\\" The other dancers resented this newcomer at the start, but later choreographed dramatic pieces for Olinekova that highlighted her strength and speed‚Äîhigh leaps, turns, and bounding. Though Olikenova described the program as hard work, she said she found it extremely gratifying. Leaving Canada Amsterdam (1973) Frustrated in her efforts to learn new things, Olinekova made plans to leave Canada at the age of 20. With just $150 to her name, she purchased a one-way ticket to Amsterdam for $100. She was hoping to find someone in Europe‚Äîmaybe a sports hypnotherapist or famous doctor‚Äîwho could help her find out what she needed to know. \\"I had yet to explore the mental aspects of the sport. I felt I needed life experience. I got both in an almost two-year odyssey that saw me push myself mentally and physically beyond the periphery of anything I had known to that time.\\" European travels She traveled to the sport science centers in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and France, having to wait sometimes for hours before the famous scientists would deign to answer even one question. She studied German in order to understand East German translations of Soviet sports documents. Switzerland (1974) In the summer of her 21st year, Olinekova was hired as a lumberjack in the forests of Switzerland‚Äîthe only woman among hundreds of men. When applying for this job clearing bush and planting trees, Olinekova was told by the foreman that they were \\"looking for men.\\" Reportedly, she pulled up her pant leg and said, \\"I'm stronger than you are.\\" The foreman replied, \\"You start in the morning.\\" Olinekova moved to Westlake Village, California to train for the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984. However, she was seriously injured in a car accident; not only did she miss out on the Olympics, but her running career was ended as well. Olinekova only competed once as a bodybuilder, in the Frank Zane Invitational on June 28, 1980. However, she had a significant impact on the sport due to her amazing quadriceps and calf development. (Wennerstrom, 2004) Her amazing legs earned her national coverage in 1981, when she was the subject of a feature article in Sports Illustrated called \\"Greatest Legs To Ever Stride The Earth\\". (Levin, 1981) Later in 1981, Olinekova appeared on the cover of the magazine New West, photographed by art photographer Helmut Newton. The photograph was one of several by Newton that ran under the heading \\"Strong Women: A Portfolio of California's Super Athletes\\". Death and afterward Olinekova died at Duarte, California at age 50 on November 26, 2003 after a long battle with breast cancer. In her eulogy, Rev. Rob Calderhead, pastor of La Canada United Methodist Church, explained that \\"although Olinekova was told by one doctor that she had only two months to live, she set her sights on recovery and courageously battled the disease for 3¬Ω years, undergoing chemotherapy, radiation and stem cell replacement at the City of Hope hospital.\\" At the time of her death, she had been working as a chiropractor in Westlake Village. While there, she was said to have sometimes provided chiropractic services in exchange for fruit. At her memorial service, longtime friend Maura Barraza explained, \\"Money was never that important to Gayle: people were.\\" ==Published works== Olinekova participated in a number of other sports, including speedskating, cycling, and rough-water rowing. She published several books on exercise and healthy lifestyles: * Go For It! (1982), Simon & Schuster. . * Legs: Super Legs in Six Weeks (1983), Simon & Schuster. . * The Sensuality of Strength (1984), Simon & Schuster. . * Winning Without Steroids (1988), Keats Publishing. . * Power Aging: Staying Young At Any Age (1998), Thunder's Mouth PR. . ==Personal bests== {  !Event !Time !Place !Date - Marathon 2:41:33 New York, USA October 26, 1980 - Marathon 2:36:12 Scottsdale, Arizona December 1, 1979 } ==References== Category:1953 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Deaths from breast cancer Category:Canadian female bodybuilders Category:Canadian female long-distance runners Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:People from Westlake Village, California Category:Sportspeople from Ventura County, California ","title":"Gayle Olinekova"},{"id":"5567886","text":"Expandable tubular technology is a system for increasing the diameter of the casing or liner of an oil well by up to 30% after it has been run down-hole. == Telescoping well design == During the planning stages, one of the primary considerations that the well engineer takes into account is the density (or \\"weight\\") of the drilling fluid. It must be heavy enough to suppress the pressure in exposed permeable formations (thus avoiding a blowout), and yet light enough to avoid breaking down the rock itself. Both parameters generally increase with depth, and create a window in which the drilling fluid density is safe. However, the mud density required to suppress fluid pressures at, say, 9000' would usually break down the formation further up the well at, say, 1000'. Therefore, the well is drilled in sections by running casing strings to cover depth ranges between which the required mud densities are suitable for that entire range. However, each bit must be smaller than the previous casing string, which in turn has to be smaller than the previous hole. This requirement of well design creates a well where each hole section is ever- decreasing in diameter. The only conventional way to combat this effect is to start with an enormous hole at the top (sometimes 30\\") in order to run as many as five casing strings and still end up with a 6\\" hole in the targeted reservoir. And this well design leaves little room for error: if the drillers are forced to run yet another casing string on account of unexpected formation pressures or hole conditions, then the target formation may be impossible to reach. Thus there is much to favor a casing system that loses minimal - or possibly no - diameter while still isolating a whole section. Many systems under development have the aim of producing a monobore well, that is, a well with a single diameter from top to bottom. == Technology == Image of Expanded Tubular FE Analysis To reduce the loss of diameter each time a new casing string or liner is set, a cold working process has been developed whereby the casing or liner can be expanded by up to 20% in diameter after being run down- hole. For this purpose, an expansion tool that exceeds the inner diameter of the tube by the required amount of expansion is forced through the pipe. This is done either hydraulically, by applying mud pressure, or mechanically, by pulling the conical/tapered expansion tool. The expansion needs to be reliable, when expanding several thousand feet below the surface. This can be from 30‚Äì6,000 ft in length. Carey Naquin was responsible for the first commercial application of expandable tubular technology. == Applications == The applications can be grouped into two main categories ‚Äì Cased hole and Open hole. Cased hole work is mainly down during the work over or completion phase of a well. The open hole products are used during the drilling period of a well. The products developed and available today in cased hole work are the expandable liner hanger and the cased hole clad. The expandable liner hanger is basically an evolution of existing equipment currently used in the oil industry, a product with better thru bore and envisaged higher reliability. The Case hole clad provide a casing patch across a damaged section of casing, or to close off previously perforated casing.

Towards the end of her life she operated as a cruise ship, based in Sydney, until scrapped in 1979. ==History== The Arcadia was built for P&O; by John Brown & Company at Clydebank in Scotland, at an estimated cost of ¬£5 million; her keel was laid in 1952 and she was launched on 14 May 1953, just a couple of hours after the Orsova of the associated Orient Line went down the ways at Barrow in Furness. Her maiden voyage commenced on 22 February 1954, sailing from Tilbury in the UK to Fremantle in Western Australia via the Suez Canal, Aden, Bombay and Colombo. Arcadia had a virtually identical sister in the Belfast-built SS Iberia. Following the return trip to Australia, Arcadia made a series of cruises from Southampton before embarking for Australia again in October 1954. This mix of liner and cruise trade was expanded in 1959 when Arcadia made her first cruise voyage from an Australian port, sailing from Sydney on a short cruise in November and then to San Francisco in December. As the number of passengers travelling by ship to Australia declined due to growth in air travel, P&O; was expanding its cruise network. In 1959, Arcadia was refitted (with refurbished cabins and air-conditioning extended to all the accommodation) and throughout the 1960s continued the pattern of line voyages interspersed with cruises from Britain and Australia, including trans-Pacific routes, some of which took her through the Panama Canal.Australian Migrant Ships 1946‚Äì1977, Peter Plowman, Rosenberg Publishing, Sydney, 2006 Following another refit in 1970, she became a full- time one-class cruise ship. For the next four years she worked the west coast of America, making a series of summer cruises to Alaska and winter cruises to Mexico. In 1975 Arcadia moved its base to Australia (replacing the Himalaya), making a final return trip to Britain and then cruising Asia-Pacific routes until in February 1979 she was delivered to a firm in Taiwan to be scrapped. Unlike her sister, Arcadia was a reliable and popular ship and whereas Iberia was the first of the post war fleet to be scrapped (in 1972), Arcadia sailed on to be the last of these ships in service. SS Arcadias bell In 1974, when Arcadia sailed up the Columbia and Willamette Rivers to reach Portland, Oregon in the United States, on the first leg of a cruise from Vancouver to Hawaii, she was the largest passenger ship ever to have visited Portland up to that time.Wohler, Milly (22 May 1974). \\"'Largest' cruise ship visits Portland\\". The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon), p. 24. From 1975 until scrapped in Taiwan in 1979, her cruising role out of Sydney was full-time. She was replaced by P&O;'s then newly acquired Sea Princess, formerly the Kungsholm. Incidents While undocking at Tilbury in September 1954, the tug Cervia crossed Arcadia's wash while listing from the strain on the towline, and the combination caused the tug to capsize and sink with the loss of five of her eleven crew. In June 1961 Arcadia hove to off Hawaii to embark a troupe of Polynesian dancers, and as she made way to dock failed to make the tight turn required and ran onto a coral reef, where she was stuck fast for two days but with little damage.Arcadia The First 21 Years, Memoir, http://www.shipsnostalgia.com/archive/index.php?t-3708.html, retrieved 4/10/2014 Two crew committed suicide by jumping overboard, in 1954 and 1971. Battling strong winds on arriving at Tilbury in 1962, the anchor was lowered in an attempt to hold Arcadia in place. The wind turned the ship onto the anchor and a 19-foot hole was torn in the bow. In the early hours of Friday 2 June 1978 the Arcadia ran into a wild storm coming back into Sydney and was hit by a rogue wave which caused extensive damage to the ship. It folded the life raft stairs in half. It also flooded the ship down to C Deck. Arcadia was sent back to Asia for repairs before it could sail again. ==Popular culture== SS Arcadia appeared as stock footage in the 1964 Perry Mason episode \\"Nautical Knot\\", set near Acapulco, Mexico. The episode only shows the ship at the dockside, though its size near the pier makes an impression on the episode's characters. A ship by the same name appears in the fifth Jurassic Park sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. It is unclear what, if any, connection this ship has to the actual SS Arcadia. In the film, the ship is used to evacuate genetically resurrected dinosaurs from their ill-fated island home due to a long dormant volcano becoming active again. ==ReferencesSources== * HMS Arcadia (Clydebuilt Ships Database) * Encyclopedia Peninsular website viewed 10 July 2006 * Arcadia of 1954 at Simplon Postcards * Australian Migrant Ships 1946-1977,Peter Plowman, Rosenberg Publishing, 2006 * Home and Back - Australia's Golden Era of Passenger Ships, Stuart Bremer, Dreamweaver Books, 1984 * Pictorial Encyclopedia of Ocean Liners, 1860-1994, William H.

To the east, the A6 runs through Taddington Dale, while Taddington Moor lies to the west. Taddington grew around farming and quarrying for limestone and lead. From 1863 to 1967 the village was served by Millers Dale railway station, some 2 miles away, which was on the Midland Railway's extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway.Railways of the Peak District, Blakemore & Mosley, 2003 The village's main attractions are Five Wells chambered tomb topped by a cairn, and the 14th-century church, with the remains of a 7th-century Celtic cross in the churchyard.

He was the third king in the line, and had succeeded his father Dharamapala. Devapala expanded the frontiers of the empire by conquering the present-day Assam and Orissa. The Pala inscriptions also credit him with several other victories, but these claims are thought to be exaggerated. == Reign == Devapala was the third king in the line, and had succeeded his father Dharamapala.History and Culture of Indian People, The Age of Imperial Kanauj, 1964, p. 50, Dr R. C. Majumdar, Dr A. D. Pusalkar His mother was Rannadevi, a Rashtrakuta princess. Earlier historians considered Devapala as a nephew of Dharmapala, based on the Bhagalpur copper plate of Narayanapala, which mentions Devapala as Jayapala's purvajabhrata (interpreted as \\"elder brother\\"). Jayapala is mentioned as the son of Dharmapala's brother Vakpala in multiple Pala inscriptions. However, the discovery of the Munger (Monghyr) copper inscription changed this view. This particular inscription clearly describes Devapala as the son of Dharmapala. Based on the different interpretations of the various epigraphs and historical records, the different historians estimate Devapala's reign as follows: {  ! Historian ! Estimate of reign -  RC Majumdar (1971)  810-c. 850 -  AM Chowdhury (1967)  821-861 -  BP Sinha (1977)  820-860 -  DC Sircar (1975‚Äì76)  812-850 } == Expansion of the Pala Empire == Devapala launched military compaigns under his cousin and his general Jayapala, who was the son of Dharmapala's younger brother Vakpala.Badal Pillar Inscription, verse 13, Epigraphia Indica II, p 160; Bhagalpur Charter of Narayanapala, year 17, verse 6, The Indian Antiquary, XV p 304. These expeditions resulted in the invasion of Pragjyotisha (present-day Assam) where the king submitted without giving a fight and the Utkala (present-day Orissa) whose king fled from his capital city.Bhagalpur Charter of Narayanapala, year 17, verse 6, Indian Antiquary, XV p 304. The highly exaggerated Badal Pilllar inscription of his descendant Narayanapala states that Devpala's empire extended up to the Vindhyas, the Himalayas, and the two oceans (presumably the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal). It also claims that Devpala exterminated the Utkalas (present-day Orissa), conquered the Pragjyotisha (Assam), shattered the pride of the Hunas, humbled the lords of Gurjara and the Dravidas.History and Culture of Indian People, The Age of Imperial Kanauj, 1964, p. 50, 55, 56, Dr R. C. Majumdar, Dr A. D. Pusalkar.Badal Pillar Inscription, verse 5, Epigraphia Indica, II p 160. These claims are exaggerated, but cannot be dismissed entirely: the neighbouring kingdoms of Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara-Pratiharas were weak at the time, and may have been subdued by Devapala. The \\"Gurjaras\\" in the inscription refers to the Gurjara-Pratiharas led by Mihira Bhoja. The Hunas probably refers to a principality in North-West India. \\"Dravida\\" is generally believed to be a reference to the Rashtrakutas (led by Amoghavarsha), but RC Majumdar believes that it may refer to the Pandyan king Sri Mara Sri Vallabha. However, there is no definitive record of any expedition of Devapala to the extreme south. In any case, his victory in the south could only have been a temporary one, and his dominion lay mainly in the north. While an ancient country with the name Kamboja was located in what is now Afghanistan, there is no evidence that Devapala's empire extended that far. Kamboja, in this inscription, could refer to the Kamboja tribe that had entered North India (see Kamboja Pala dynasty). The Munger copper plate (Monghyr Charter) indicates that the Palas recruited their war horses from the Kambojas, and there might have been a Kamboja cavalry in the Pala armed forces.Dynastic History of Northern India, I. p 311; ; History of Ancient Bengal, 1971, pp 127, 182-83 : \\"The Palas employed mercenary forces and certainly recruited horses from Kamboja (Ins B.8 V 13). Viradeva, a scholar appointed by him as the abbot of Nalanda, is believed to be a native of Nagarahara (identified with modern-day Jalalabad). This has led some scholars to speculate if Devapala indeed launched a military expedition to the present-day Afghanistan, during which he met Viradeva. But some historians believe that Devapala defeated the Arab rulers of the north west. == Religious leanings == Devapala was a staunch sponsor of Buddhism, and is said to have sanctioned the construction of many temples and monasteries in Magadha. He maintained the famous Buddhist monastery at Uddandapura (Odantapuri). Buton Rinchen Drub credits his father Dharmapala for building the monastery, although other Tibetan accounts such as that of Taranatha, state that it was magically built and then entrusted to Devapala. Balaputradeva, the Sailendra king of Java, sent an ambassador to him, asking for a grant of five villages for the construction of a monastery at Nalanda. The request was granted by Devapala. He also patronized the Vikramashila University and the Nalanda University.

It was originally broadcast on the HBO network from 1998 until 2004. Sex in New York City, the show focuses on the sex lives of four female best friends, three of whom are in their mid-to-late thirties, and one of whom is in her forties. Along with these four women, there were numerous minor and recurring characters, including their current and ex-boyfriends/husbands/lovers, as well as many cameo appearances. There are also the film adaptations Sex and the City: The Movie (2008) and Sex and the City 2 (2010). ==Main characters== Carrie Bradshaw Carrie Bradshaw (born October 10th, 1966), is the literal voice of the show, as each episode is structured around her train of thought while writing her weekly column, \\"Sex and the City\\", for the fictitious newspaper, The New York Star. A member of the New York glitterati, she is a club/bar/restaurant staple known for her unique fashion sense; yoking together various styles into one outfit (she often pairs inexpensive vintage clothing with high-end couture). A self- proclaimed shoe fetishist, she focuses most of her attention and finances on designer footwear, primarily Manolo Blahnik, though she has been known to wear Christian Louboutin and Jimmy Choo. She often goes on shopping sprees, and pays much attention to her evolving and bold dress style, which is not fettered by professional dress codes. Although her only income is from her freelance weekly newspaper column, she often overspends her limit and maxes out her credit card in a single shopping trip. To some viewers, her lack of shoe-shopping self-control and overall seemingly immature spending might be a flaw, and her money management misadventures follow her through a few episodes. However, her priorities are later brought into perspective when she is forced to buy her once rent-controlled apartment to avoid moving out when the building goes co-op; she acquires a mortgage by supplementing her income with other writing assignments, and takes a sizeable loan from Charlotte in the form of Charlotte's engagement ring to Trey. Her apartment is her home for the entire series and is another source of pride; it is an open-planned studio in an Upper East Side brownstone that is enviable for its stabilized rent, space, large closet, and good location. She eventually purchases back the apartment from Aidan in the fourth season. In later seasons, her essays are collected as a book, and she begins taking assignments from other publications, like Vogue and New York, as well. Charlotte York Charlotte York (born January 23, 1967), is an art dealer and graduate of Smith College with a wealthy Connecticut blue-blooded upbringing. She is the most conservative and traditional of the group, the one who places the most emphasis on emotional love as opposed to lust, and is always searching for her \\"knight in shining armor\\". As the youngest of the group, she is also the most idealistic about romance and love. Presenting a more straightforward attitude about relationships, usually based on \\"the rules\\" of love and dating, she often scoffs at the lewder, more libertine antics that the show presents (primarily by way of Samantha), but despite her conservative outlook, she makes concessions (while married) that even surprise her sexually freer girlfriends (such as her level of dirty talk, oral sex in public and \\"tuchus- lingus\\"). She gives up her career soon after her first marriage, divorces upon irreconcilable differences around in vitro fertilization and receives a Park Avenue apartment in the divorce settlement. She eventually remarries to her less than perfect, but good-hearted divorce lawyer, Harry Goldenblatt, after converting to Judaism. In the final episode, they adopt a daughter from China, Lily, and in the first movie, Charlotte gives birth to daughter Rose, with Harry proclaiming, \\"now we have a Lily and a Rose!\\". Miranda Hobbes Miranda Hobbes (born July, 1966), is a career-minded lawyer with extremely cynical views on relationships and men. A Harvard University graduate from Philadelphia, she is Carrie's confidante and voice of reason. In the early seasons, she is portrayed as masculine and borderline misandric, but this image softens over the years, particularly after she becomes pregnant by her on again-off again boyfriend, Steve Brady, whom she eventually marries. The birth of her son, Brady, brings up new issues for her Type A, workaholic personality, but she soon finds a way to balance career, being single and motherhood. Of the four women, she is the first to purchase an apartment, (an indicator of her success), which she leaves in the final season to move to a larger home in Brooklyn with Steve and Brady. Samantha Jones Samantha Jones (born April 28, 1958), the oldest of the group, is an independent publicist and a seductress who avoids emotional involvement at all costs, while satisfying every possible carnal desire imaginable. She believes that she has had \\"hundreds\\" of soulmates and insists that her sexual partners leave \\"an hour after I climax.\\" In Season 3, she moves from her full-service Upper East Side apartment to an expensive loft in the then-burgeoning Meatpacking District. Over the course of the show, she does have a handful of real relationships, but they are more unconventional than those of her friends, including a lesbian relationship with Brazilian painter played by Sonia Braga. ==Significant others== Significant others of Carrie Bradshaw John James Preston (Mr. Big) Aidan Shaw Aidan Shaw (John Corbett) is one of Carrie's long-term boyfriends. He is a sweet, good-natured furniture designer and Mr. Big's emotional opposite. At first, Carrie questions their seemingly perfect relationship, but over time accepts his sincerity. However, Aidan ends their relationship after her confession of an affair with Big. They get back together six months later at Carrie's urging, eventually moving in together. When her apartment building goes co-op, he buys the apartment and proposes. When Carrie finds the engagement ring prior to Aidan's proposal, she freaks out and throws up as the ring isn't adequate to Carrie's taste. When Aidan finally proposes, Carrie's shocked to see a completely different ring. As it turns out, Samantha helped Aidan choose a more beautiful, appealing ring, much to Carrie's delight. Despite her initial misgivings, she accepts his marriage proposal but then becomes panicked and feels suffocated by the relationship, and realizes he still does not fully trust her, given her past affair with Big, and they break up for good. A year later they met on the street. Right before her date with a new flame, Jack Berger. It's revealed that Aidan has married Kathy, a fellow furniture designer and has a son, Tate. Six years later, Carrie runs into Aidan in Abu Dhabi at a market. Aidan is there to buy some samples for his furniture company. They resolve to meet for dinner to catch up. Aidan and Kathy had another two sons: Homer and Wyatt and are still very happy. In a moment of passion, they kiss. Carrie stops herself and runs away. That was the last time they met. Jack Berger Jack Berger (Ron Livingston) is Carrie's intellectual counterpart, a sardonic humorist writer. Hailing from Downer's Grove, Carrie first meets him when he walks into a meeting between her and her publisher. Theirs is a relationship of witty banter and common thoughts, and honesty. Berger's advice to Miranda when she questions the lack of a phone call after a first date, \\"He's just not that into you,\\" became a pop culture catchphrase. Berger's and Carrie's relationship is then strained by their career issues; a book deal of his falls through just as her columns are being published as worldwide success in book form. He memorably breaks up with her on a Post-It: \\"I'm sorry, I can't, don't hate me.\\". They never met again. Aleksandr Petrovsky Aleksandr Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov), referred to by Carrie occasionally as \\"The Russian\\" or \\"My Lover\\" is a famous and divorced conceptual artist who becomes Carrie's lover in the final season. He sweeps her off her feet with huge, romantic gestures, beautiful gifts and shows her the foreign pockets of New York that she has never seen before. Her relationship with him brings up all sorts of questions in Carrie's mind about finding love past \\"a certain age\\" and whether or not she wants to settle down as a family woman. When he's preparing to return to Paris for a solo exhibit he invites Carrie to come live with him, which, after several deliberations (and one fight) with her friends, she does. While in Paris, Carrie does much sightseeing alone and starts to feel the loneliness of Petrovsky's neglect. After spending so much time on her own, she realizes that he will never reciprocate the level of emotional involvement that she offers because his career will always come first. They break up after he accidentally slaps her in the face. She comes back to New York with Big who went to find her after her friends encouraged him to \\"go get our girl\\". Casting Baryshnikov as Petrovsky was noteworthy because in real life, Candace Bushnell, the author on whom Bradshaw is based, married real- life ballet dancer Charles Askegard of the New York City Ballet. Significant others of Samantha Jones James James (James Goodwin) is a man Samantha meets while out by herself at a jazz club. She makes a conscious effort to not sleep with him until she gets to know him first. When they finally do have sex, she discovers that he is under-endowed to the point that she cannot enjoy herself (his fully erect penis is three inches long). She begins pulling away physically and cannot bring herself to tell him--until she is faced with the prospect of couples counseling. Maria Diega Reyes Maria Diega Reyes (S√¥nia Braga) is a Brazilian sensual lesbian artist that Samantha meets at a solo exhibit while admiring her work. Maria is immediately attracted to her, but since Samantha doesn't believe in relationships, they try to maintain a friendship. The chemistry proves to be too strong and it isn't too long before Samantha is introducing her lesbian lover to her stunned friends. At first, Samantha has a great time \\"getting an education\\" as Maria teaches her about lesbian sex and how to make an emotional connection while making love. Unfortunately, Samantha begins to grow uncomfortable when the relationship talk starts to replace the sexual activity and Maria is equally uncomfortable with Samantha's sexual history, and they separate. Richard Wright Richard Wright (James Remar) is a successful hotel magnate who doesn't believe in monogamy until he meets Samantha. He seduces her, and when their no-strings-attached sexual relationship begins to escalate, both parties struggle to keep their emotional distance. Eventually, they give in and attempt exclusivity, but Samantha becomes suspicious that he is cheating on her. When she does catch him cheating, after putting on a wig and spying on him, she breaks up with him, but eventually takes him back after he begs for her forgiveness. In the end, Samantha still has her doubts about his fidelity, and she breaks up with him, saying \\"I love you Richard, but I love me more.\\" Towards the end of the series, Richard re-surfaces, admitting that Samantha was the best thing that ever happened to him. But after having sex with him again, she realizes how empty his emotions are and she rejects him for Smith Jerrod. Smith Jerrod Jerry Jerrod/Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) is a young waiter Samantha seduces in a trendy restaurant called \\"Raw.\\" She tries to maintain her usual sex-only relationship with him, but he slowly pushes for something more. He is a wannabe actor whose career Samantha jump starts using her PR connections (including changing his name from \\"Jerry Jerrod\\" to \\"Smith Jerrod\\"), getting him a modeling job that turns into a film role. Just when she thinks Smith's age and experiences aren't enough for her, he gives her unconditional support during her fight with breast cancer. In the final episode, Smith flies back from a film set in Canada just to tell her that he loves her, which she counters with \\"You have meant more to me than any man I've ever known,\\" which, for Samantha, is a far greater statement. In the first Sex and the City movie, she breaks up with him in the end after having relocated her business to LA but missing New York City and Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte. In the second he invites her to be his date to the opening of his new action flick, showing that they remain on good terms. Significant others of Charlotte York Trey MacDougal Dr. Trey MacDougal (Kyle MacLachlan) is Charlotte's knight in shining armor archetype. It was a fairytale beginning when Trey's cab screeched to a stop in the street to avoid hitting her as she was fleeing a bad date. Charlotte was a damsel in distress, he, a knight in a yellow cab. Trey is a Park Avenue cardiologist with blue blood and deep brown eyes. With his pedigree comes social status, a country house and wealth. Add to that chiseled chin his perfectly coiffed hair and he is the stuff that dreams (especially Charlotte's) are made of. He also has exceptional manners and is always considerate in an old-fashioned way. However, despite Trey being exactly the perfect model of what Charlotte looks for in a husband, she finds the reality to be quite different. While on the surface, Trey seems Charlotte's perfect match, behind closed doors the couple faces some real-life problems: Trey is impotent, and his overbearing mother tries to maintain her power over Trey and drive a wedge between the married couple. They try to work things out and do succeed in conquering his sexual dysfunctions. But when they start to have problems conceiving, Trey ultimately becomes too overwhelmed. On the day when Charlotte succeeds in projecting the ultimate in connubial bliss--a photo spread in a magazine featuring her Park Avenue apartment--she and Trey split up and he moves back in with his mother. Harry Goldenblatt Harry Goldenblatt (Evan Handler) is Charlotte's divorce lawyer and second love, once divorced, helping bring an end to her marriage to Trey. When beginning divorce proceedings, she found herself unable to be cold-blooded and severe around her extremely attractive lawyer. She asks to switch to a different lawyer in the same firm: Harry Goldenblatt, the antithesis of what she seeks in a man. He was bald, pudgy, messy, sweaty, crude, had poor manners, and had an excess of body hair. But in time Harry become very attracted to Charlotte, and seduced her. She declared it \\"the best sex of my life\\" and began what she thought to be a meaningless sexual affair with him. However, she began falling for him. Initially, she tried to change him to suit her image of what a man should be, but ultimately she accepted him as he is. After he appreciated her sacrifice for him--converting to Judaism and giving up her dream of being married with him, just to be together--he proposed to her and the two were married. After that, they made an effort to adopt a baby. Finally, China gave them a cute baby girl, named Lily. Four years later, in the first film, Harry and Charlotte finally conceive a child by accident. Charlotte gives birth to daughter Rose, with Harry proclaiming, \\"now we have a Lily and a Rose!\\". Two years later, in the second film, Harry and Charlotte are still in love and happy. They hire an attractive nanny named Erin. Charlotte begins to worry that Harry with be tempted, and cheat on her. Harry has no interest in Erin, and it turns out that she is a lesbian. Significant others of Miranda Hobbes Skipper Johnston Skipper Johnston (Ben Weber) is a geeky, sensitive twenty-something web designer whom Carrie introduces to Miranda. From the moment they meet, Skipper is enamored of her, but Miranda is unimpressed and irritated by him, calling him \\"Skippy\\". They date for a short time, before Miranda breaks up with him due to their \\"being in different places\\". Steve Brady Robert Leeds Dr. Robert Leeds (Blair Underwood) is a sports medicine doctor who moves into Miranda's building during season six. He is the seemingly perfect man: successful, sexy, attentive to Brady, and utterly devoted to her. Robert and Miranda have fun and great chemistry, but when the time comes she is unable to declare her love for him, in part because she still loves Steve. Since he still lived in the same building as Miranda, she and Steve moved to Brooklyn. ==Recurring characters== Stanford Blatch Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson), often referred to as the show's \\"Fifth Lady,\\" is Carrie's best friend outside of the three women. A gay talent agent from an aristocratic family with a sense of style paralleled only by Carrie's, viewers receive the impression that they have a long-standing relationship built within their younger, wilder days in the New York City club and bar scene in the 1980s. He had said that they have been friends since Carrie was riding the subways and wearing Candie's. The only supporting character to receive his own storylines on occasion, Stanford represents the show's most constant gay point of view to sex on the show, generally based around the physical insecurities and inadequacies of someone who does not \\"have that gay look.\\" In the last two seasons of the show, he is partnered with Broadway dancer Marcus Adente (Sean Palmer). We are led to believe this relationship does not last, however, as in the film he arrives at a New Year's party alone and has no one else to kiss except long-time rival Anthony Marentino, whom he weds in the sequel. Anthony Marentino Anthony Marentino (Mario Cantone) is a Sicilian- American gay event planner who becomes close to Charlotte after styling her first wedding -- he goes on to style Charlotte's H&G; photo shoot, her second wedding and Carrie's book release party. He is not self-effacing like Stanford and freely doles out blunt, sometimes bawdy, advice to Charlotte. (For instance: Upon hearing that she hadn't had sex since her divorce, he exclaims: \\"If you don't put something 'in there' soon, it'll grow over!\\"). In Season 4, Episode 2, Charlotte tries to set up Anthony and Stanford. Anthony snubs Stanford, which results in resentment and competition ensues for the entire show run. However, in the first film, the two are seen kissing at a New Year's Eve party, and then get married in the sequel, with Anthony proclaiming at their wedding that Stanford is \\"the first man to accept me for the man that I actually am.\\" Magda Magda (Lynn Cohen), the Ukrainian housekeeper/nanny who was introduced in the third season becomes an ersatz mother figure and a thorn in Miranda's side. Her attempts to push traditional marriage/motherhood attitudes on Miranda are both subtle (buying her a rolling pin \\"To make pies. It's good for a woman to make pies.\\") and intrusive (replacing her vibrator with a statuette of The Virgin Mary). She is friendly to Steve even before he and Miranda are back together, and adores Brady to the point of making a collage of his pictures. Magda comes to accept Miranda's lifestyle choices and continues working for Miranda, even when she and Steve move to Brooklyn. Although Miranda is reluctant to accept help, Magda makes life manageable for Miranda after the birth of Brady by serving as both a housekeeper and a nanny. Bitsy von Muffling During the last episode of Season 5, the girls meet aging socialite Bitsy von Muffling (Julie Halston) right before and during her Hamptons wedding to flamboyant, and presumably gay, cabaret entertainer Bobby Fine (Nathan Lane). We see her again in the middle of Season 6 pregnant with Bobby's baby. She advises Charlotte, who's also had trouble becoming pregnant, to try acupuncture like she did. In the movie, we do see a brief reappearance of Bitsy, seated halfway down the table (right next to Stanford) during the dinner party.

The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0‚Äì21 and sometimes until 25 throughout Colorado and the Midwest. The hospital also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. Children's Hospital Colorado is the only children's hospital (verified by the CHA) in Colorado. Additionally, The hospital has outpatient centers, campuses, and doctors offices around Illinois. The hospital features an ACS verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and features a rooftop helipad to transport critically ill patients. ==History== In 1897, Dr. Minnie C.T. Love, a physician, political office holder, suffragist, and a member of the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, led the founding of the Babies Summer Hospital in Denver, Colorado. Denver's high-country ventilation was touted as a cure for a variety of diseases. Using a mix of fresh air and Colorado sunshine, six medical staff and volunteer nurses treated up to 50 children under the age of five. Early on, those volunteers saw a need for a permanent hospital that would \\"care for sick, injured and crippled children from birth to 16 years of age\\" and which would be supported mainly by volunteer contributions. With that goal to guide them, this same group of intrepid volunteers officially incorporated as The Children's Hospital on May 9, 1908. In 1909, Children's Colorado converted a former residence at 2221 Downing Street in Denver into a ‚Äúwell equipped institution with a capacity of 30 beds,‚Äù admitting its first patients on Feb. 17, 1910. As the demand for child healthcare services increased throughout the region, the hospital quickly outgrew its original location and raised funds to build a new and improved facility, which opened in 1917 at 19th Avenue and Downing Street in downtown Denver. After numerous expansions over the years at the hospital's downtown Denver location, Children's Hospital Colorado opened its new campus in Aurora on September 29, 2007. The hospital designed by ZGF Architects includes 284 beds and advanced medical equipment especially designed for children, as well as inspiring artwork and outstanding family accommodations. On June 21, 2011, the hospital announced that its name was changing from The Children's Hospital to Children's Hospital Colorado. The hospital made the change to help differentiate it from other hospitals in the country with the same name. In March 2020, the hospital announced that it was expanding its age limit to all patients up to age 30 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to help bring demand away from overcrowded adult hospitals. Although the hospital is treating patients under 30, it is not accepting patients with significant substance use or psychiatric disorders because those are outside of its areas of care. This is a small difference from the hospitals usual age limit of 25. In 2021 the hospital was ranked as the #6 best children's hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report on the publications' honor roll list. == Programs == *It is the only Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center in Colorado. *It has a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the highest distinction granted by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children's Hospital Colorado NICU treats nearly 750 infants each year from a 10-state area, and is the only NICU in the region with the experience and technology to treat virtually any medical condition affecting newborns. *The Heart Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado is the largest in the region, treating more than 20,000 patients each year. It is also one of only eight stand-alone pediatric research centers in the country. **Children's Hospital Colorado Heart Institute Transplant Program/ *Children's Hospital Colorado offers pediatric weight management programs to combat childhood obesity. *Children's Hospital Colorado Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders is the only pediatric cancer center in the Rocky Mountain region providing care for patients from birth to age 25. It also has the region's only pediatric neuro-oncology program for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment; program for teenagers with cancer; pediatric bone marrow transplant program; pediatric onco-fertility program that helps cancer patients maximize their chances for future fertility; and the region's only pediatric Experimental Therapeutics Program investigating promising new drugs for cancer treatment. *The Orthopedics Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado treats growing muscles, joints and bones. *The Center for Gait and Movement Analysis at Children's Hospital Colorado was the second lab in the world to offer movement analysis through motion-capture technology, kinetics, and electromyography, helping specialists fine-tune the best possible course of treatment. *The Breathing Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado, along with other Colorado physicians, pioneered many of the standard practices used to treat and diagnose pediatric respiratory disease today. It was the first in the world to recognize and treat interstitial lung disease, the first to use nitric oxide to treat neonatal hypertension, and the first to initiate newborn cystic fibrosis screening. == Affiliation == Children's Colorado's campus is affiliated with, and adjacent to, the University of Colorado School of Medicine. The University is home to education and research facilities. Children's Colorado is staffed with doctors from the Department of Pediatrics. ==2015 facts and figures== *Licensed Beds: 479 *Total Surgeries: 19,776 *Inpatient Admissions: 11,594 *Average Length of Stay (in days): 6.0 *Total Outpatient Visits: 453,476 *Total Days of Inpatient Care: 106,293 *Emergency and Urgent Care Visits: 163,647 *Total Number of Employees: 6,030 *Total Medical Staff: 2,078 *Total Residents and Fellows: 225 *Total Volunteers: 2,646 == Clinical and surgical services == Children's Hospital Colorado treats pediatric patients with childhood illnesses and provides surgery in areas such as: {    Clinical    Surgical  - Allergy Abdominal and thoracic surgery - Asthma, Breathing & Lung Bariatric surgery - Behavior & Development Cleft, craniofacial and plastic and reconstructive surgery - Brain, Spinal Cord & Nervous System Colorectal surgery - Cancer & Blood Disorders Dental surgery - Dental Ear, nose and throat surgery - Diabetes, Endocrine & Growth Fetal surgery - Digestive, Liver & Pancreas Heart surgery - Ear, Nose & Throat Burn treatment and trauma surgery - Emergency medical conditions Minimally invasive surgery - Eye Neurosurgery - Genetics & Inherited Metabolic Diseases Orthopedic surgery - Gynecology Ophthalmology surgery - Hearing, Speech & Learning Pediatric and adolescent gynecology - Heart Transplant surgery - Immune System & Infectious Disease Urology surgery - Kidney, Bladder & Urinary  - Newborn  - Orthopedic  - Psychology & Psychiatry  - Rehabilitation & Therapy  - Skin  - Sleep  - Sports Medicine  - Teen Health  - Weight Management  } == Gallery == File:The Childrens Hospital of Denver Old 1.JPG File:The Childrens Hospital of Denver Old 2.JPG File:The Childrens Hospital of Denver Old 3.JPG File:The Childrens Hospital of Denver Old 4.JPG File:The Childrens Hospital of Denver Old 5.JPG File:The Childrens Hospital in Denver Logo.JPG File:The Childrens Hospital of Denver Front.JPG File:The_Childrens_Hospital_in_Denver_Atrium.jpg == See also == * List of children's hospitals in the United States ==References External links == * Children's Hospital Colorado website Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1917 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 2007 Category:Children's hospitals in the United States Category:Hospitals in Colorado Category:Buildings and structures in Aurora, Colorado Category:Hospitals established in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in Colorado Category:Skyscrapers in Colorado Category:Trauma Center ","title":"Children's Hospital Colorado"},{"id":"5568030","text":"Barry Biggs (born 1947, although some accounts list 1953; St. Andrew, Jamaica) is a Jamaican reggae singer, best known in the UK for his cover of the Blue Magic song, \\"Sideshow\\", which got to number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1977. ==Career== Biggs worked as a recording engineer and cameraman with the Jamaican Broadcasting Company, and also spent time as a member of the band the Astronauts, before becoming the lead singer for Byron Lee's Dragonaires.Leggett, Steve \\"[ Barry Biggs Biography]\\", AllMusic, Macrovision CorporationLarkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 26.

Located beside the Knik River just nine miles (14.5 km) south of Palmer and about six miles outside the Municipality of Anchorage limits, it is a prominent landmark in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, as well as a popular hiking destination. The name was given in 1939 in honor of the pioneers of the Matanuska agricultural colony of the mid-1930s. The Pioneer Ridge Trail leads up the eastern shoulder, beginning below 200', it allows access to the South summit. The North summit, and true summit of Pioneer Peak does not have a trail, and advanced mountaineering techniques are required. The first ascent of this peak was made June 1936 by Vernon Haik and John Wolffe via the Northwest Face.Vincent Hoeman, The Western Chugach Range, Alaska, American Alpine Journal, 1966 ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Pioneer Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

Bard College's interest in curricular innovation and the reform of international education coincided with the interests of a group of creatively-minded scholars from St.Petersburg State University. In the fall of 1997 the Smolny Center announced a program of open courses to be attended by students from SPSU and other St.Petersburg universities. In view of the considerable number of students and professors who responded, showing great interest in liberal education, the Center was transformed into the Program \\"Arts and Humanities\\" (Smolny College of Liberal Arts and Sciences) in 1999. The Program accepted its first students in the 1999/2000 academic year. On February 28, 2011, the Academic Council of St.Petersburg State University voted to create the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

In the GPP phase, athletes work on general conditioning to improve strength, speed, endurance, flexibility, structure and skill. GPP is generally performed in the off-season, with a lower level of GPP-maintenance during the season, when SPP is being pursued. GPP helps prevent imbalances and boredom with both specific and non-specific exercises by conditioning the body to work. ==Purpose== GPP is the initial stage of training. It starts every cycle of training from the macro-, meso- and microcycle after restoration and recovery. It consists primarily of general preparatory and some specialized conditioning exercises to work all the major muscles and joints. This preparation prepares the athlete for the more intense training such as explosive plyometrics. This period is also used for rehabilitation of injured muscles and joints, strengthening or bringing up to par the lagging muscles and improvement of technique. ==Specific example== For the high-level and elite athlete, GPP is used more for recovery and warm up rather than for developmental purposes. This is based on the premise that high level and elite athletes maintain their physical conditioning throughout the year and train throughout the year on a specific periodization scheme. This is a major distinguishing characteristic of the high-level athlete. ==References== Category:Exercise physiology ","title":"General physical preparedness"},{"id":"5568089","text":"Hotel Ezra Cornell (HEC) is an annual weekend-long educational conference put on by the students of the Cornell School of Hotel Administration for leaders of the hospitality industry. Composed of educational seminars, leisure activities, and food and beverage events, the program is currently in its 95th year, predating the School of Hotel Administration and making HEC one of the oldest organizations at Cornell University. The purpose of the weekend is for students to practice the skills they have learned in the classroom and to showcase their talents to industry professionals, many of whom are Cornell alumni. HEC is planned, managed, and staffed entirely by students. Over the course of one academic year, the student Board of Directors, assistant directors, and managers plan all of the details of HEC, and during the weekend, over 300 students are involved with executing program events. All aspects of the program, including food preparation and service, program marketing, event design, and the turndown service at night, are handled by students, with faculty members acting only as advisers. == History of HEC == HEC has its origins in 1925, when Professor Howard Meek, who would later serve as the first Dean of the School of Hotel Administration, took a group of students to New York City to manage the Hotel Astor for a day. Upon returning to Ithaca, the students decided to hold the grand opening of \\"The Only Hotel for a Day\\" to demonstrate that hospitality management could be taught in an academic setting, and organized an extravagant formal dinner party for hospitality industry leaders. Lacking an event space of its own, the inaugural Hotel Ezra Cornell was held on May 7, 1926 in Risley Hall on Cornell's campus. The second year of HEC was a turning point in the history of Cornell's hospitality program, and featured one of the world's leading hoteliers, Ellsworth Milton Statler, as a guest of honor to assess the quality of Cornell's nascent hospitality program. At the main banquet, Statler commented, \\"I'm converted. Meek can have any damn thing he wants,\\" an moment traditionally held to mark the founding of the School of Hotel Administration. As the School of Hotel Administration gained prominence, future HECs became more elaborate, with each year adopting a unique theme that informed program events. An example of this practice was HEC 60, which was themed \\"Diamond Robbery\\" and styled as a mystery theater. The whole weekend was centered on solving a fictitious diamond robbery, with each social event providing clues. Such themed events were gradually phased out with HEC 77, when the focus of the weekend shifted from socializing to learning and was modeled after existing hospitality industry conferences, with a greater emphasis on guest speakers and panelists. Students coined the tag line \\"The Best Ever\\" to describe how their HEC would top all previous HECs. ==Important dates in the HEC timeline== *1926: HEC 1 *1927: E.M.

Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held individual members of Congress do not automatically have standing to litigate the constitutionality of laws affecting Congress as a whole. ==Background of the case== The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the president to nullify certain provisions of appropriations bills, and disallowed the use of funds from canceled provisions for offsetting deficit spending in other areas. At its passage, the Act was politically controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, six members of Congress, including Republican Mark Hatfield, sued to prevent use of the line-item veto. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found the Act unconstitutional. ==Opinion of the Court== The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue, as they had not suffered any particularized injury. The courts reasoning held that individual members of Congress were subject to strict limits on their ability to sue, particularly in a dispute between different branches of government. ==Subsequent Events== After taking effect, the Act was later found unconstitutional in Clinton v.

That same year, he finished the season number one in the nation in singles. He was also named ITA National Player of Month a record three times in '03, and named Southeastern Conference Player of Year in '03, finishing his final season with a 46‚Äì7 singles record. He owned the school record for career wins in singles (99) until 2015. He holds the record for single-season wins (46 in '03). Reynolds attended Vanderbilt for three years and majored in business, but left in 2003 to pursue his professional tennis aspirations. He reached the third round of the Australian Open in 2005, defeating Nicol√°s Almagro and Andrei Pavel before falling to Spaniard Rafael Nadal. In August 2008 he beat world no. 42 Marc Gicquel of France 7‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4. On February 2, 2009, he reached his career high singles ranking when he reached 63rd in the world.

Garth (Barron), a bloodthirsty egomaniac, neglects to tell his soldiers that there has been a cease fire. The sergeant sends his unit into an enemy bunker, where they are fiercely attacked by the enemy. The few who survive secure the bunker, and Garth attempts to take credit for their actions.

After box office cashier Julia Postal was informed by shoe store employee John Brewer that a man had entered the theater, she called Dallas police. Despite attempting to shoot the arresting officer, Oswald was arrested. Oswald was fatally shot two days later by club owner Jack Ruby while being transferred to another jail. Coincidentally, lead actor Baynes Barron was born on May 29, 1917‚Äîthe same day as the fallen president.

It is noted for its cult following, celebrity appearances and media profile. It has been played since 1994 between social teams composed of radio station employees (Megahertz) and musicians (Rockdogs) dating back to the early 1990s. It is currently held during the Australian Football League (AFL) split round. In contrast to today's strict AFL codes of conduct the Community Cup is promoted as embracing grassroots community amateur football and as a result it is promoted as \\"kid and dog friendly\\" with quarter and half time pitch invasions for traditional kick-to-kick. Social alcohol, smoking and even streaking are tolerated. Despite crowds of up to 23,000 people, it has been a trouble free and casual event. ==History== The teams involved in the cup date back to the 1990s. Espy Rockdogs were founded in 1990 as a social footy team to play against Chasers. The team played in a charity match known as the \\"Footy Mouth Cup\\" against the Tote Hotel in 1993, raising $500. The first \\"Community Cup\\" was held in 1997 when 3RRR Program Manager James Young proposed the creation of the 3RRR and PBS FM Megahertz to play against the Rockdogs and raise money for St Kilda's Sacred Heart Mission. The first match organised was held at Ross Gregory Oval in St Kilda. Drawing a crowd of over 2,000 people it was successful in raising over A$6,000. Due to the interest generated, Sacred Heart Mission assumed its organisation and a larger venue, Junction Oval, a former Victorian Football League stadium was chosen to accommodate the larger crowds. The 2005 event packed the Junction Oval to capacity, attracting 23,000 people. In 2006, despite the installation of temporary fencing to accommodate more spectators, the stadium was once more packed to capacity. The 2007 event introduced an entry charge $5 for the first time, previous events were by gold coin donation. Despite the entry fee, a similarly large crowd attended. In May 2008 Sacred Heart Mission withdrew due to increased costs of running it. RRR tried to keep the event alive but there was not enough time to secure a charity partner to host the event on the planned date and much to the disappointment of the St Kilda community, the event was shelved. The cup secured a new charity in 2009, Reclink, and it was moved to Elsternwick Park, held on 21 June. A positive online feedback poll result saw news radio stations ABC Local Radio and Radio National cover the match for the first time. With the new venue, the event took a hit in its attendance, drawing just 8,000, however in 2010 attendances rebounded to over 10,000. The 2011 match drew 12,000 people and raised over $120,000. In 2012, the match was held outside of Melbourne for the first time, playing a match at Henson Park in Marrickville, Sydney. In 2015, the Community Cup launched in Adelaide (featuring the mighty Rockatoos versus the Anchors) and in Perth, while 2016 sees the game also launch in Hobart and Brisbane. In 2017, the Reclink Community Cup was held at Victoria Park in Abbotsford with Spiderbait and The Peep Tempel headlining the event. Courtney Barnett and Remi supported. The 2019 cup was held at Victoria Park, with Magic Dirt headlining, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the cup. ==The match== Megahertz warming up in the 2005 Community Cup The football match features two teams of non- footballing local communities: the 3RRR/3PBS Megahertz, which consists of personnel from Melbourne's two main community radio stations, and the Espy Rock Dogs, a mix of former and present musicians and bar staff from the Esplanade Hotel. The Rockdog's team president is local satirist Fred Negro, who each year includes the community cup weekend in his weekly pub strip for the Inpress magazine. The Megahertz wear red and white, and the Rockdogs wear black, red white and yellow guernseys. The match is usually umpired by a mix of comedians and notable music industry people, costumed according to a chosen theme, such as 'Do You Love Me?' in 2011 as a tribute to Nick Cave.Community Cup Music Line-up Announced , 3RRR News. Retrieved 8 November 2012. Individual awards The match is followed by the presentation of a number of medals named after recently deceased musicians, including Dave McComb, Paul Hester, Grant McLennan, Tim Hemensley, Norm Fagg, Andrew Entsch and Stuart Speed. The Dave Taranto Medal, named for a former PBS-RRR comic presenter, is awarded to the \\"most silly Megahertz\\". The only living medal is the Stephen Hurley Medal, named for a member of the first Rockdogs side in 1993 who broke his spine in November that year and now uses a wheelchair. The Steve Connolly Medal is awarded for the best on ground, and is presented by The Age sports writer Rohan Connolly in memory of his brother. Celebrity appearances Celebrities to have played in the match include Mick Harvey, Angus Sampson, Tex Perkins, Link Meanie, Tim Rogers, Wally Meanie, Samantha Lane and Kram. Peter Rowsthorn regularly umpires the match. == Entertainment == Dave Graney and the Lurid Yellow Mist at the 2006 Community Cup The match itself is accompanied by a two-to-three-hour-long concert, along with entertainment at half time, and usually sees notable acts volunteering their time to entertain the Community Cup audience. Notable performances include Paul Kelly, TISM and Magic Dirt (2004), one-off reunion concerts by Rebecca's Empire and Weddings Parties Anything (2005) and Dave Graney (2006) and Mach Pelican (2007). Paul Kelly returned again to accompany Ren√©e Geyer on harmonica while she sang \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" at the 2006 Cup, with state sports minister and former VFL footballer Justin Madden tossing the coin to decide which team was kicking for which goal. In 2009, live acts included Cosmic Psychos, Kram, Doll Squad, Jordie Lane, and The Scared Weird Little Guys. The 2010 line-up included The Blackeyed Susans, Money For Rope, Little Freddie and The Pops, Living End, and Nick Barker and the Reptiles.

Khosrov was the son and successor of King Tiridates III and Queen Ashkhen. His paternal aunt was the Princess Khosrovidukht; his sister was Princess Salome and had an unnamed sister who married St. Husik I, one of the earlier Catholicoi of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Khosrov received the epithet Kotak because he was a man of short stature. He was the namesake of his paternal grandfather Khosrov II of Armenia, and the Parthian and Armenian monarchs of this name, see Khosrau. Khosrov lacked the moral and physical vigour of his father,Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.102 yet he was very tactful, diplomatic and was backed by St. Vrtanes I.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.102 Armenia under his rule enjoyed a period of prosperity.

During Khosrov's reign, two generals, Vache Mamikonian and Vahan Amatuni, distinguished themselves for their valor in battle, often coming to help the king. During these years, pro-Sassanid and anti-Mamikonian sentiment grew in Armenia and so did anti-Roman sentiment. Pro-Sassanid groups gained popularity so much so that they were successful in assassinating Catholicos St. Aristaces I, second son of Gregory the Illuminator. The Sassanid King Shapur II of the Persians invaded Armenia twice and did gain some territory. Vache Mamikonian was killed in those battles and was later named a saint by the Armenian Apostolic Church for his sacrifice. Khosrov died in 339 and was succeeded by his son Tigranes VII (Tiran). By an unnamed wife, Khosrov had three children: * Son, Tigranes VII, also known as Tiran. * Daughter, Varazdoukht.

He subsequently switched to the Republican Party. He was a member of the California State assembly in 1859, 1860, and 1862, representing Plumas County. He supported black testimony in the California courts in 1862 and 1863, a position the Democrats unsuccessfully used against him as an issue in his third campaign for the Assembly and his subsequent campaign for Congress. Running as a supporter of Senator John Conness, Shannon was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-eighth Congress (March 4, 1863 ‚Äì March 3, 1865), in which he served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Interior. As a congressman he participated little in debate, but voted consistently for administration measures. Due to political turmoil in California over Conness, Shannon was not a candidate for reelection in 1864. He was selected as a California Congressional delegate for the Lincoln funeral, in which capacity he participated in speeches delivered outside the capital building in Columbus, Ohio. ==Later career== Shannon was appointed surveyor at the port of San Francisco on August 11, 1865, and served four years. He was again a member of the State Assembly, representing San Francisco, in 1871 and 1872, serving as the Speaker of the Assembly the first year. He was appointed by President Grant appointed him Collector of Customs at San Francisco, which he served as from July 1, 1872, to August 10, 1880, after which he resumed his mercantile pursuits. ==Death and burial== Shannon died in San Francisco, California on February 21, 1897. His body was originally buried in the Masonic Cemetery, but reburied in 1931 at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. ==External links== *Congressional Biography * # Category:1827 births Category:1897 deaths Category:California state senators Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from California Category:People of California in the American Civil War Category:Speakers of the California State Assembly Category:California Republicans Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Thomas Bowles Shannon"},{"id":"5568212","text":", also known as Alice Academy or Alice School, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tachibana Higuchi, serialized in the sh≈çjo manga magazine Hana to Yume from 2003 to 2013.

He is best known for being a former member of Philadelphia-based hip hop groups Jedi Mind Tricks (JMT) and Army of the Pharaohs (AOTP). He was involved in JMT since the early days but left before the recording of their first album The Psycho-Social, only to rejoin the band a couple years later. He made his official debut on Jedi Mind Tricks' second album, Violent by Design, in 2000. Jus Allah is known for his aggressive lyrics that are commonly Afro-centric subject matter, as well as heavily using a multi-syllabic rhyming technique which is abundant in Violent by Design and his debut solo All Fates Have Changed. In later years he switched his delivery to a more aggressive, deeper and raspier style, most noticeable in later JMT albums such as A History of Violence and Violence Begets Violence. Jus Allah's involvement in Jedi Mind Tricks has sometimes been conflictual, resulting in him leaving and rejoining the band several times. ==Career== 1993‚Äì2000: Early days, Jedi Mind Tricks Jus Allah did some collaborations with the JMT crew as early as 1994, under the Soulcraft moniker and the Onesoul Productions banner. Due to this, he is revered as a co-founding member of the group. The earliest known recorded song with JMT is \\"Skinny Paz vs Vinnie Paz\\", which is collected as one of the Soulcraft bonus tracks on the 2003 Babygrande reissue of JMT's The Psycho-Social CD. However, Jus took some time away from music in the mid 1990s to attend college, which is largely the reason for his disappearance on the first JMT LP and the formation of their indie label Superegular Recordings. 2000 saw what is known amongst the JMT fanbase as his greatest recognition; the release of the classic Jedi Mind Tricks album Violent by Design. As the unofficial third member of the group, Jus Allah is on almost every track with JMT frontman, Vinnie Paz, and the two trade verses organically which crafted a fan-favorite album that many still hold in high regard as his best work to date. During this era, the three JMT members all had different aliases: \\"Ikon the Hologram\\" (Paz), \\"Megatron\\" (Jus), and \\"The Enemy of Mankind\\" (Stoupe). All but Stoupe later dropped these aliases. 2001‚Äì2006: Leaving Jedi Mind Tricks, All Fates Have Changed A short while after the release of Violent by Design, Jus left amid uncertainty over JMT's new association with Babygrande Records. He then went on to start his solo career at rapper Virtuoso‚Äôs label, Omnipotent Records, to which both Virtuoso and Jus Allah were disowned by JMT over. In 2005, after releasing a single (\\"White Nightmare\\"/\\"G-O-D\\") and being part of the camp's lineup for Era of the Titans, Vol. 1, Jus left Omnipotent Records and subsequently joined Babygrande, re-associating himself with the JMT crew. It was on this label he recorded his first solo album, All Fates Have Changed, which included the single and B-side from his previous label as bonus tracks. The biggest collaboration of his solo career was featured on this album, with GZA from the Wu-Tang Clan lending a guest verse to \\"Pool of Blood\\". However, due to a dispute with label CEO Chuck Wilson over the album, Jus quit the label and left before completing it, at the same time disassociating any newfound JMT connection, and leaving the label to release the album on their own. Jus later stated in interviews that he had never given his approval for the album to be released, and wasn't satisfied with some of the album's production. This marks the end of the rapper's \\"Megatraum\\" era. In early 2006, an album called Necronomicon was released featuring both Jus and Boston rapper Bomshot as hip-hop duo The Devil'z Rejects. Jus stated that he had absolutely nothing to do with the album, and that he was not being paid for it. The new verses on the album were most likely old, unreleased recordings from his prior label Omnipotent Records, where Bomshot was also an artist. At some point after The Devil'z Rejects was proven to be a sham, Jus released a mixtape entitled, Bomshot is a Faggot, featuring multiple rare songs and remixes. Jus is currently working on his second album entitled MMA (Meanest Man Alive), changed from tentative title The Colossus, which was going to be produced by Enemy Soil producer C-Lance, in its entirety, before the falling out of the two in 2013. According to a recent interview with Jus, the instrumentals on MMA will be composed by Level 13 (other than the single, \\"180¬∞\\", which had been produced by C-Lance and already released and copyrighted). The album was set to be released multiple times in the last few years but never dropped. It is now slated for a late 2015 release. 2006‚Äì2013: Reunion with Jedi Mind Tricks In 2006, Jus reunited with his former group Jedi Mind Tricks and released their first collaborative track in five years, titled \\"The Rebuilding\\", as an exclusive, online-only MySpace download. In an interview conducted in September 2007 on the Art of Rhyme website, Jus Allah announced that he has rejoined Jedi Mind Tricks. In the interview he states: \\"I'm back in the group [and] I'm focused on... putting out the next Jedi Mind Tricks album... 'A History of Violence'.\\" In addition, he says that he has rejoined Babygrande and that the entire \\"All Fates Have Changed\\" fiasco has been put in the past, and was in large part a misunderstanding . Following his re- induction into the group as an official member, Jus was added to the Army of the Pharaohs roster lineup in 2007, solidifying a spot on their second studio album, Ritual of Battle. In 2008, Jedi Mind Tricks, now reunited with the original three-member lineup of Stoupe, Vinnie Paz, and Jus Allah, released their sixth album A History of Violence. Following the creative streak Enemy Soil was on, AOTP released their third album The Unholy Terror which featured Jus. Finally, while selecting beats for the next JMT album, Paz & Jus got tired of Stoupe not participating much and focusing on his side projects, and decided to release 2011's Violence Begets Violence without Stoupe involvement. Outside production was handled mostly by newcomer C-Lance who Paz had directly hired to the label after hearing his talent from a beat CD. This was to be the last Enemy Soil project that featured Jus' creative streak with the camp. JMT's new label, Enemy Soil, was to release Jus Allah's second solo album, M.M.A. (Meanest Man Alive). However, since the rapper left Enemy Soil, he is now moving on to other ventures. An Enemy Soil promo single was released in 2009 called 'Hell Awaits Promo' featuring Vinnie Paz. 2013‚Äìpresent: Departure from Enemy Soil, MMA In 2013, Jus Allah left Jedi Mind Tricks again, as well as leaving the Army of the Pharaohs. The reason for his departure has not been disclosed,Could Slaine and Jus Allah beef be the reason for Allahs departure? (Accessed: August 2014) but is rumored to be beefs with in-house producer C-Lance and Heavy Metal Kings' affiliate Slaine, as well as tensions between Jus and Paz over the struggles. M.M.A. (Meanest Man Alive) was originally announced to be released November 26, 2013. However, on November 25th, 2013, Jus Allah tweeted that the album was pushed back again. With his departure from Jedi Mind Tricks and Army of the Pharaohs, this meant that ties with Enemy Soil had been severed, thus leaving him unsigned. On August 14, 2015 the album cover, track list and pre-order for M.M.A. (Meanest Man Alive) were published on Jus Allah's Tumblr and it was released on September 4, 2015.http://jusallahmma.tumblr.com/post/126714851472/cans- thoughts-converted-danger-180¬∫-psycho ==Discography== Solo albums *All Fates Have Changed (Babygrande Records ‚Äì 2005) *M.M.A. (Meanest Man Alive) (2015) *The Best of Jus Allah (2016) Group albums *Jedi Mind Tricks, Violent by Design (Superegular Recordings ‚Äì 2000) *Jedi Mind Tricks, Violent by Design ‚Äì Deluxe Edition (Babygrande Records ‚Äì 2004) *The Devilz Rejects, Necronomicon (Dynasty Muzik ‚Äì 2006) *The Devilz Rejects, Necromonicon ‚Äì Limited Edition (Dynasty Muzik ‚Äì 2007) *Army of the Pharaohs, Ritual of Battle (Babygrande Records ‚Äì 2007) *Jedi Mind Tricks, A History of Violence (Babygrande Records ‚Äì 2008) *Army of the Pharaohs, The Unholy Terror (Babygrande Records / Enemy Soil Records ‚Äì 2010) *Jedi Mind Tricks, Violence Begets Violence (Enemy Soil Records ‚Äì Oct. 25th, 2011).

His father served as a Roman client king of Arsaces from 339 until 350. His date of birth is unknown and little is known on his early life. Sometime during his father's reign, the Sassanid King Shapur II launched a war on Rome and her allies, firstly by persecuting the Christians that lived in Persia and Mesopotamia.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103 Shapur II, by capturing these territories, began to deal a severe blow to Roman prestige in the East. Sometime into his father's reign, Shapur II with his army had invaded Armenia; eventually taking Arshak II with members of his family as hostages as they were betrayed to Shapur II by his father's chamberlain. Arshak II, along with members of his family, had become Sassanid political prisoners in which his father was blinded and thrown into prison after Shapur II accused his father of collusion with Rome. The nobles of Armenia were infuriated by the brutality of Shapur II and his treatment of Arshak II with members of his family, took up arms and fought against Shapur II and his army with assistance from the Romans. They successfully drove Shapur II and his army out from Armenia. After Shapur II was defeated, he signed a treaty, and Arshak II and members of his family were released from prison. As Arshak II's father was depressed and blinded from his experience in captivity, he abdicated his throne, and Arshak II succeeded his father as Armenian King in 350. ==Reign== Arsacus II, like his father, strongly pursued a policy on Christian Arianism.Terian, Patriotism And Piety In Armenian Christianity: The Early Panegyrics On Saint Gregory, p.18 In the early years of his reign, Arshak II found himself courted by the Roman Empire and Sassanid Empire, both of which hoped to win Armenia to their side in the ongoing conflicts between them. By 358, Arshak II had married a Greek noblewoman Olympias, the daughter of the late consul Flavius Ablabius. The historian Ammianus Marcellinus (XXV. vii, 9-13; vol. II, pp. 532/3-534/5) described Arshak II as a \\"steadfast and faithful friend\\" to the Romans. The King of Sassanid Persia, Shapur II, intensified his efforts to conquer Armenia once and for all. He was able to bribe two Armenian noblemen, Vahan Mamikonian and Meruzhan Artsruni, and had them join his royal court. Arsacus II focused on strengthening the army. He rewarded loyal generals and severely punished disloyal ones. He crafted an ambitious plan in which all criminals that settled in his newly founded city of Arshakavan were given complete amnesty. Approximately 150,000 individuals were settled in the city. His hope was to create a large army directly under his command, but many in the Armenian nobility did not agree with the plan and subsequently destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants. The Romans and the Persians clashed again. Roman Emperor Jovian, being in a very difficult position, negotiated an undesirable peace with Shapur II in which he allowed the Persians to take over the fortresses of Nisbis, Castra Maurorum, and Singara along with a part of Armenia. Arshak II found himself abandoned by the Romans and left to defend Armenia all alone. The Persians swiftly attacked, but were unsuccessful, partly due to the leadership of the general (Armenian: sparapet) Vasak Mamikonian. Shapur II, seeing that brute force was not going to subjugate Arshak II, turned to treachery. Arshak II was invited by the Persian King for peace talks. When Arshak II arrived with Vasak Mamikonian, he was taken prisoner and his general was skinned. Arshakuni Armenia under Arsacus II ==Imprisonment and suicide== Living in a Sasanian prison named the Castle of Oblivion, Arshak II was unable to stop the Sasanian invasion of Armenia. Shapur II conquered Armenia and tried to convert Christian Armenians to Zoroastrianism, the main religion of the Sassanid Empire. Sometime in 369 or 370, an Armenian named Drastamat visited the imprisoned Arshak II. The king reminisced about his glory days and, feeling depressed, took his visitor's knife and killed himself. Drastamat, moved by what he had just witnessed, took the knife from Arshak II's chest and stabbed himself as well. ==Legacy== Despite having a troublesome reign, Arshak II was able to improve many aspects of his kingdom. The chief architect of the reforms was his cousin, Saint Nerses I the Great. They included: * the establishment of many monasteries, to isolate monks from the stress of everyday life and helped spread the gospel; * the building of hospitals; * the founding of many schools that would teach Assyrian and Greek, since the Holy Bible was read in those languages at that time; * the interdiction of inbred marriages, polygamy, divorce, pagan rituals, drunkenness and revenge killings; * strongly encouraging slave-owners to be merciful to slaves and treat them as equals. ==Namesake== Arshak II was named in honor of his Parthian, Pontian and Armenian ancestors who ruled under this name as king, in particular he was named in honor of Arshak I, also known as Arsaces I, the founder of the Arsacid Parthian dynasty and the first ruler of the Parthian Empire. : The letter of Vagharshak, king of Armenia, to Arshak the Great, king of Parthia, : To Arshak, king of earth and sea, whose person and image are as those of our gods, whose fortune and destiny are superior to those of all kings, and whose amplitude of mind is as that of the sky above the earth, from Vagharshak your younger brother.Moses of Chorene, History of Armenians, p.82 ==Physical appearance== According to the Armenian 5th-century historian Faustus of Byzantium in his writings History of the Armenians (Book IV, Chapter 15), states Pharantzem in describing Arshak II as, ‚Äúphysically, he is hairy, and his color is dark‚Äù. ==Family and issue== Arshak II appeared to have three known wives. * Prior to his Armenia kingship, Arshak II married an unknown woman who appeared to have died before 358. His first wife bore him a son: ** AnobAccording to Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the priest & historiographer of the Catholicos Nerses the Great, gives the name Anob as the father of Papas‚Äô nephew Varasdates (Varazdat).

The first of a series of treaties called the Numbered Treaties that occurred between 1871‚Äì1921, this accord was essentially about peace and friendship. The eight days of treaty-making ended with the indigenous groups agreeing to \\"cede, release, surrender and yield up to Her Majesty the Queen and successors forever all the lands\\" in southern Manitoba to the Crown, to allow for peaceful co-existence in exchange for an annual annuity and material goods such as clothing and agricultural supplies. Within a year of the agreement, however, the indigenous communities approached the Canadian government declaring that a number of the items promised, which would become known as the ‚ÄúOutside Promises‚Äù, within the treaty had not been handed over to them yet, although subjects of the Crown continued to settle the land-based upon the agreed-upon Treaty. On April 30, 1875, a council of the federal government passed an order stating that it must be ensured that all of the Outside Promises were to be fulfilled and considered a part of the main agreements within Treaty 1. However, due to the different intentions and understandings of the Canadian officials and the indigenous communities at the time of its creation, this treaty continues to be considered controversial into the 21st century. ==History== Also known as the Stone Fort Treaty, Treaty 1 would be the first treaty signed since the 1867 formation of the modern Canadian government and one year after the Province of Manitoba was formed as a part of the Canadian Confederation.  Goals  The treaty was established between Canadian officials and these Indigenous communities as both groups desired the security of land and resources. The Anishinabe and Swampy Cree Nations sought to maintain their traditional lands while gaining security in transitioning to a new form of life with the incoming arrival of settlers. In its process of annexing the West, the Canadian government sought to assimilate the Indigenous peoples in their movement to settle prior areas of trade. Through Treaty 1, as well as the other ten, Canadian officials sought a more diplomatic and least resistant form of annexing land in the West after hearing about the many violent conflicts that erupted in the United States between American officials and indigenous peoples. In addition, Adams G. Archibald, the new lieutenant governor of Manitoba, wanted to establish a treaty that would secure the government with land around Lake Winnipeg and the western side of the Red River Valley in order to build up agriculture and extract resources. For officials such as Archibald, the annexation of Western Canada was more evolved around developing agriculture and settlements rather than establishing trade, which had defined the economic landscape of the region for the past century.  Negotiations  The negotiations of Treaty 1 spanned over a period of eight days from July 27 to August 3. Led by governor Archibald and his commissioner Wemyss Simpson, the Canadian government invited the indigenous communities to attend negotiations for a treaty at Lower Fort Garry (or Stone Fort). Approximately one thousand indigenous individuals attended including adults and children of all genders, who were led by a number of chiefs that included Mis-koo-kenew or Red Eagle (also known as Henry Prince). In his opening comments that would later cause lasting confusion, Archibald referenced Queen Victoria as the ‚ÄúGreat Mother [who] wanted to deal fairly‚Äù with the indigenous peoples, supporting their needs, and hoping they would adopt agricultural practises. The governor then went on to lay out both his and the Canadian government‚Äôs terms of negotiations, including the introduction to the idea of reserves. He assured that indigenous ways of life would be sustained as they would not be forced to adopt agriculture and could choose to live on reserves if they so wished. And in addition, they could continue to use their traditional land as they did in the past for hunting, fishing, and other means of sustaining their lifestyle After listening to Archibald‚Äôs speech, the indigenous leaders returned several days later with their list of demands for the treaty that included guaranteeing large areas of land for each individual or family. Archibald and the other Canadian officials, however, believed this demand to be too high, so they negotiated the land rights down to approximately ‚Äú160 acres of land for a family of five‚Äù; which was similar to the land rights outlined in the Dominion Lands Act for British settlers. After much debating, the two sides came to an agreement and the treaty was signed August 3.  Articles and Memorandum of Treaty 1  The final articles of Treaty 1 were outlined as follows: the indigenous peoples were to hand over a large portion of land in the southeast and south- central current-day Manitoba to Governor Archibald and the Crown. These lands were to include areas around Lake Manitoba and Winnipeg as well as around the Red River Valley. In return, the Canadian government were to provide each band with a reserve large enough to accommodate each family of five with 160 acres of land (or a larger or smaller amount based on the size of the family). In addition, each member of these bands were to be given a gratuity of three dollars in accordance with a yearly sum of fifteen dollars based on a family of five. This annual payment could be provided in cash or items such as clothing, blankets, or hunting supplies based upon the desires of the family. The government also could provide and maintain a school on each reserve if one was desired. And the Crown would prohibit the introduction and sale of alcohol on reserves.  The Outside Promises  Within a year of the signing of Treaty 1, word reached Governor Archibald that the Swampy Cree and Anishinabe peoples were declaring that some of the treaty terms were not being fulfilled. Known as the ‚ÄúOutside Promises‚Äù, numerous items the indigenous peoples were promised beyond the written text of the treaty had not been provided to them yet. These items included distinguished clothing for Chiefs and their councilors, farming supplies such as ploughs, and animals like oxen and cows for their agricultural needs. While a new commissioner was appointed to deal with the needs of the indigenous peoples in the area and the issue was brought to court, the federal government did not resolve the ‚ÄúOutside Promises‚Äù until April 30, 1875, seven years later. It was then the council passed an order that stated that the memorandum of items orally promised to the bands were to be considered a part of Treaty 1 and therefore had to be carried out by the commissioner. Additionally, the annuity of three dollars to each band member was to be raised to five dollars a year. Finally, the order stated that each Chief was to be provided with additional payments of twenty dollars annually as well as be given extra items of clothing in addition to those stated in the memorandum.  Significance of Treaty 1  The signing of Treaty 1 marked the beginning of a long list of treaties that were to come over the next couple of decades, signifying the Canadian government‚Äôs growing interest in the West as more than just a trading hub but as a suitable place for developing agriculture and growing populations of settlers; as well as a peaceful means to annex land. For Governor Adams Archibald the treaty would enable him to develop businesses such as mills and farms on the fertile land around Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba and in the Red River Valley. For the Anishinabe and Swampy Cree Nations Treaty 1 held a much larger significance. They believed it was a way for them to survive and adjust into a new way of living with the drastic changes that were coming to their land and that were already beginning to take shape. Their leaders believed a treaty with the Crown would help give them security when the large groups of settlers would make their way into the land. In addition, the indigenous peoples believed that the treaty would also help elevate the threat of the serious decline of buffalo populations, which threatened their way of life. Ultimately, in signing the treaty the indigenous leaders hoped to gain a connection with the ‚ÄúGreat White Queen Mother‚Äù that would ensure security and benefits for their people. == Controversy == Treaty 1 is considered controversial due to the differing understandings of the treaty and what agreements were entailed within it.  Final Contract or Covenantal Relationships  The Canadian government and its negotiators viewed the treaty as a mere contract in which the Anishinabe peoples surrendered land over to them in exchange for compensation. In addition, they viewed the signing of the treaty as ‚Äúfinalizing‚Äù or the end of negotiations and relations with the indigenous peoples in this area. For the Anishinabe, however, the treaty held a much greater significance as they regarded it as a ‚ÄúCreator-sanctioned covenant‚Äù that would guarantee the continuation of their livelihood. Unlike the Canadian government, the Anishinabe also saw the agreement as the beginning of a continuing relationship with the government in which both groups would provide benefits and maintain coexistence with each other.  Property Rights Under Differing Legal Frameworks  Much of the confusion, disagreements, and misinterpretations of the treaty revolved around the different understandings of the parameters of the agreement. Mainly this involved the two groups‚Äô different viewpoints on the use of land and property ownership. In the negotiations the government officials put forward two European concepts of land ownership which were: the Anishinabe surrender of land to the government and the setting aside of land or reserves for the indigenous peoples. The Anishinabe viewed these proposals through their systems of inaakonigewin (law), in which they believed land to be not a possession of one person or persons but a shared entity. Based on the available evidence from the negotiations, it seems that, despite disagreements in the amounts of land to be provided within the tenants of the treaty, the Anishinabe agreed to the terms of land division as they understood it as a treaty of non-interference and equality between themselves and incoming settlers; in which they shared land desired for agriculture while also being able to utilize land for their traditional activities. Essentially, the Anishinabe did not view the agreements about giving the land to the government as the surrender of their title to land but the sharing of land and its resources. The controversial and problematic nature of these land agreements lie in the government officials not bringing up or making clear their concepts of the land as property and therefore the Anishinabe giving over of land to be a total surrender of it to the government. In addition, the land agreements within the treaty are controversial, as it was never recorded that the Anishinabe agreed to surrender their land to the Canadian government.  Kinship and the Great Mother  Treaty 1 also remains controversial due to the differing understandings of kinship, the role of the ‚ÄúGreat Mother‚Äù and her promises. As with Governor Archibald‚Äôs opening statement on the ‚ÄúGreat Mother‚Äù, government officials utilized this term throughout the negotiations of the treaty simply as a way to connect with the Anishinabe kinship language, which helped enable them to enter into these agreements. For the Anishinabe, the term held a much deeper significance as, based on their kinship relations and duties, the ‚ÄúGreat Mother‚Äù or Queen acted as a symbolic figure who would treat their peoples with kindness, respect, and as equals, listening and aiding them with their needs. It was through this figure that the Anishinabe understood the treaty as one of mutual respect, shared resources, and support in their needs with the Canadian government. However, due to the events of the memorandum of 1875 and the additional unfulfilled promises to the Anishinabe beyond the written treaty, the Canadian government did not find significance in the promises of the ‚ÄúGreat Mother‚Äù. ==List of Treaty 1 First Nations== * Brokenhead Ojibway Nation * Fort Alexander (Sagkeeng First Nation) * Long Plain First Nation * Peguis First Nation * Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation * Sandy Bay First Nation * Swan Lake First Nation ==See also== * The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples ==ReferencesExternal links== *Treaty 1 including text *Map of the Numbered Treaties Category:1871 in Manitoba Category:1871 treaties Category:Numbered Treaties ","title":"Treaty 1"},{"id":"5568295","text":"William Taylor (1821‚Äì1902) was an American Missionary Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, elected in 1884. Taylor University, a Christian college in Indiana, carries his name. ==Ancestry and birth== Taylor was born May 2, 1821 in Rockbridge County‚Äîhome to Sam Houston (b.1796), Robert E. Lee (b. 1807), and Stonewall Jackson (b. 1824)‚Äîin the Commonwealth of Virginia. He was the oldest of eleven children born to Stuart Taylor and Martha Hickman. In his autobiography, Story of My Life (1896), Taylor describes his grandfather, James, as one of five brothers who were \\"Scotch-Irish of the Old Covenantor type‚Ä¶who emigrated from County Armagh, Ireland, to the colony of Virginia, about one hundred and thirty years ago\\" (i.e. 1766). The Hickman family was of English ancestry and settled in Delaware in the late 1750s. Both families \\"fought for American freedom in the Revolution of 1776\\" and afterward emancipated their slaves. Taylor‚Äôs father, Stuart, was a \\"tanner and currier‚Äîa mechanical genius of his times\\"; his mother was \\"mistress of the manufacture of all kinds of cloth\\". Both parents, he says, were of \\"powerful constitution of body and mind‚Ä¶their English school education quite equal to the average of their day\\". ==Conversion to Christ== Before William was ten years old, his grandmother had taught him the Lord's Prayer and explained that he could become a son of God. He longed for this relationship, but was unsure how to obtain it. Overhearing the story of a poor Black man who had received salvation, he wondered why he could not, also. He recounts in his autobiography, :\\"soon after, as I sat one night by the kitchen fire, the Spirit of the Lord came on me and I found myself suddenly weeping aloud and confessing my sins to God in detail, as I could recall them, and begged Him for Jesus' sake to forgive them, with all I could not remember; and I found myself trusting in Jesus that it would all be so, and in a few minutes my heart was filled with peace and love, not the shadow of a doubt remaining.\\" He entered the Baltimore Annual Conference in 1843. Bishop Taylor traveled to San Francisco, California in 1849, and organized the first Methodist church in San Francisco. The 1860 edition of Address to Young America refers to him as \\"... of the California Conference.\\" Taylor University was named after him and according to their website he started the first hospital in California. ==Missionary travels== Between 1856 and 1883 he traveled in many parts of the world as an evangelist. His vast missionary travels included Australia and South Africa (1863-1866); England, the West Indies, British Guiana, and Ceylon (1866-1870); India (1870-1875); South America (1875-1884); and Liberia, Angola, Congo, and Mozambique (1885-1896).Lay, Robert F. \\"Lessons of Infinite Advantage: William Taylor's California Experiences.\\" Lanham: The Scarecrow Press, 2010. He was elected Missionary Bishop of Africa on May 22, 1884, and retired in 1896. As stated in his book \\"The Flaming Torch in Darkest Africa,\\" the title of the work was adopted by the bishop according to the nickname given to him by the local community. In the introduction, written by Henry M. Stanley, it states, \\"The natives everywhere on the territories where his missionary work called him knew him as 'The Flaming Torch,' or 'Fire Stick,' as some might translate the Zulu word Isikunisivutayp.\\"Taylor, William. \\"The Flaming Torch in Darkest Africa.\\" New York: Eaton & Mains, 1898.

Nonetheless, the mission did produce the first modern grammar of Kimbundu, the national language of Angola. The \\"self- supporting mission\\" concept is not explained in Robert Cust's note, but he squarely identified himself as critical of Taylor's \\"Missionary methods\\".

DataEase was created in the early 1980s by software developers Arun GuptaInternet World Magazine - \\"An End To Web Coding: Toolmaker Aims For Discipline in App Engineering\\" by David F. Carr and Joseph Busch. The first version of the software was released in 1981 by Software Solutions Inc. The principals sold the company to Sapphire International Corporation of the United Kingdom in 1991. Sapphire continues to develop and market the product. There are two distinct product arcs in DataEase' history: DataEase for DOS and DataEase for Windows. == DataEase for DOS == Originally called Datamaster,A Brief History of DataEase DataEase' early hallmark was the ease with which non-programmers found they could rapidly develop useful software applications. DataEase' design emphasized the visual design of screen forms and reports while hiding almost all of the arcane details such as properties of the underlying data structure. In addition, complex data management processes that would typically require a multitude of complex steps to complete with traditional programming tools were handled automatically and transparently as a user made changes to his/her application.The Probert Encyclopedia of Science & Technology entry for DataEase For example, when editing an existing form, if the user removed a field, added another, indexed another and changed the data type of yet another, the necessary steps required to reflect those changes in the data structure underlying the form were automatically and non-destructively applied when the form was saved. Report writing was similarly streamlined. The user simply defined access to the desired data using a simple procedural language known as DataEase Query Language (DQL). A prompting script editor, which permitted any user to instantly create DQL script with no prior knowledge of DQL syntax remains one of DataEase' most overlooked and beneficial features. One was not required to memorize details about the application's components or DQL syntactical construction prior to writing a valid DQL script.  Sample DQL Script  For Employees with (Salary < 50000 and YearsOfService > 4 and LastReviewGrade > 85) List Records LastName in order; FirstName ; CurrentSalary : item sum ; CurrentSalary * data-entry EnterRaiseAmount : item sum . Modify Records CurrentSalary := CurrentSalary * data-entry EnterRaiseAmount . In addition to simplified definition of data forms, reports and procedures, DataEase for DOS provided facilities for defining an application's user access, navigational menus, multi-format importing of data from other sources, data exporting, data backup and restoration, system documentation and user help, backing up and restoring data and integrating external programs into the application. DataEase for DOS applications provided record-level locking meaning they could be accessed simultaneously by many other users.  DataEase at Work  DataEase for DOS gained an eclectic following among application developers and those responsible for managing proprietary business processes in the corporate world. The DataEase Resource Guide, published by DataEase International in the late 1980s lists approximately two hundred commercially available applications spanning specialized domains from Waste Management to Law Enforcement. Indeed, many corporate users deployed business-critical applications using DataEase including organizations such as NASA, Ford Motor Co., Citimortgage (FKA Lomas Financial Corporation), and the American Automobile Club. DataEase for DOS was distributed worldwide and, according to information provided by Sapphire International, peaked at an installed base of approximately 2 million seats. Despite the fact that Sapphire ceased distribution of DataEase for DOS in 2003, a significant number of DataEase for DOS applications remained in active use worldwide as of 2008.  Awards  DataEase for DOS was recognized with a number of prestigious industry awards,The DataEase Relational Database System A Brief History by Phil Winkler, DCC including: * PC Magazine Editor's Choice: 1986, 1988, 1989 * PC Magazine Best of Award: 1988, 1990 * PC Week Labs Database Challenge development Shootout - Olympia PC User show: Winner 1989 (Julian Brearley & Gary Cowan), 1990 (Julian Brearley & Simon Irwin) == DataEase for Windows == DataEase for Windows (DFW) is a rapid application development tool for constructing Windows database applications. DataEase for Windows abandoned many of the intuitive features of its DataEase for DOS ancestor. The DataEase for Windows product was designed and positioned to address the needs of the more technical programmer. This was due to the belief at the time that soon all data would be stored in SQL-based client-server platforms, and that DataEase itself would evolve into a SQL development tool. DataEase for Windows was initially released in 1994, as a follow up to DataEase Express, which lacked the DQL procedural language. The user interface was overhauled and the automatic creation of data structures along with screens (Forms) was abandoned. Despite the fact that DataEase for Windows incorporated both an automated migration tool (from DE DOS 4.53) and the ability to directly acquire tables and data from DFD5, many long-time DataEase for DOS users found it difficult to break out from the hierarchical CUI paradigm and make best use of the new tools in the Windows product. DataEase for Windows' acceptance by existing DataEase for DOS users was therefore significantly hindered, and those who delayed the decision to move and instead upgraded to more recent DOS versions found that while they could share data with Windows versions, to achieve a full Windows application, forms and report layouts all had to be re-created from scratch in DFW. Even though business rules could be imported with the tables, and DQL's could be imported also either by cutting and pasting or by the 'DOS report' facility in DFW version 5.5 on, the difficulty still remained that an application designed with a work-flow for the single-tasking DOS environment was frequently unsuited for the multi-session Windows environment. The difficulty and the considerable expense posed by the task of re-writing their applications forced many otherwise-satisfied DataEase users to reconsider their choice of the DataEase platform. Conversely, new users of DataEase for Windows with no previous experience found it an effective tool, and some important systems were written using it during the second half of the 1990s. Since DataEase version 7 (2006) interoperability has been abandoned as being too restrictive for the product's development to be a good 'Windows citizen'. == DataEase 7.2 == In 2008 a new DataEase development team was appointed under the leadership of Ulrik Krohn to take DataEase into a new era which will eventually culminate in a completely web based product. DataEase 7.2 was officially launched on July 1, 2009. This version is the first to use the 64 bit operating system and was extensively reworked to contain more than 1,000 improvements and fixes DataEase 7.2: The first step on the way forward, and the last of an era. The release of 7.2 also marked the time when DataEase International Ltd. became once again an independent product company solely focused on the product and its development. DataEase services continue to be provided by the Sapphire Group.http://sapphiregroup.com/nad.php DataEase 7.3 is scheduled for the end of the year and DataEase 8 promises to be to the Web community what DataEase for DOS was to the character based community. It will be completely web based but with full interoperability with Windows. It will be the first DataEase since DOS with improved and interactive DQL/OML/BRL editing. DataEase 8 will make it as easy to make transaction intensive, advanced, Web-based applications. ==References External links == * DataEase Product Web Site * Connectease - A Family of Tools and Services Supporting DataEase Users * A DataEase User's Forum/BBS * DataEase Services User's Forum Category:Database administration tools Category:DOS software ","title":"DataEase"},{"id":"5568327","text":"WIZF (101.1 FM, \\"101.1 The Wiz\\") is an urban contemporary radio station licensed to Erlanger, Kentucky serving the Cincinnati area. The station is owned and operated by Urban One. It broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 2,500 watts. Its studios are located at Centennial Plaza in downtown Cincinnati, and the transmitter site is west of the downtown area. ==History== Early years Ken Thomas, Inc., received a construction permit for a new FM radio station on 100.9 MHz in Erlanger, Kentucky, from the Federal Communications Commission on June 1, 1964. WKKY-FM signed on in September 1965, broadcasting a full-service format. WKKY-FM was bought in late 1968 by the Christian Broadcasting Association, owners of WTOF in Canton; the call letters were changed to WHKK and a new format of religious programs instituted. The Christian Broadcasting Association also converted the station to 24-hour operation. Under its ownership, WHKK became known for its gospel music and its intensive public service programming, including an \\"unheard-of\\" four-hour news block in the evenings and local sports coverage. Airing some 160 high school games a year by the early 1980s, WHKK also became the exclusive Cincinnati-market home of Kentucky Wildcats football and the United States Football League. On October 14, 1985, WHKK became WSAI-FM; the WSAI call letters, long a fixture in Cincinnati, had been abandoned by 1360 AM after that station had used them since 1923. Its owner, Mortenson Broadcasting, had grown to own stations elsewhere in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland. WIZF 1986 brought the biggest change in the history of the frequency when Inter-Urban Broadcasting Partnership Ltd. acquired WSAI-FM for $2 million. It was immediately apparent that WSAI-FM was about to flip to an urban contemporary format, given the other stations owned by Inter Urban, including WYLD-FM New Orleans and WZEN-FM in St. Louis; Cincinnati had two stations already in the format. Prep sports coverage previously heard on WSAI-FM migrated to two other northern Kentucky stations, WIOK and WTSJ. WSAI-FM went silent on midnight on November 24 as the ownership transfer awaited consummation. The next day, a burglar broke into the studios in Erlanger and stole $8,200 of equipment, though the theft was said to not have an impact on operations by the new owner. After taking a delivery of its own studio equipment, WIZF \\"The Wiz\\" finally signed on January 24, 1987. The new station edged out one of its format competitors, WCIN, but was far behind the other, WBLZ (94.9 FM), in the first ratings survey. Despite the performance, it fired its morning show host, Allen Guess. Ratings continued to climb for WIZF and fall for the competition. In August 1988, without authorization from the Federal Communications Commission, WIZF increased its power and antenna height, prompting the FCC to open a formal investigation and warn other broadcasters not to do the same without a construction permit. The move had been announced in an on-air stunt in which the staff started claiming that they would walk out unless they got a 40 percent raise. The station went silent on August 14 at 6 p.m., returning to the air six hours later with a message from Inter-Urban president James Hutchinson, who claimed that the demand had been settled and the jocks got their 40 percent. The next morning, the station promoted that the 40 percent was not a monetary increase but rather a 40-foot height increase on their tower antennae, which raised suspicions at WBLZ. The station admitted the infraction after the investigation was opened; station manager Reggie Brown was fired. Inter-Urban filed for bankruptcy in December 1991 after failing to come to a deal with its largest creditor, Barclays. The company continued to operate as a debtor-in- possession, but to satisfy $4 million of the claim by Barclays, a bankruptcy court approved the sale of WIZF in 1994 to Blue Chip Broadcast Company, which was owned by local minority investors including Procter & Gamble executive Ross Love and then-Ohio state treasurer Ken Blackwell. The chairman and president of Inter-Urban‚Äîwhich had hoped to retain the station and revitalize it‚Äîunsuccessfully objected to the buyer, claiming that venture capitalist John Wyant had installed an African American chairman to make the company appear to be minority owned, but then set onerous financial terms designed to eventually allow Wyant to buy the station outright. At the time of the sale, WIZF had moved into a tie for third place in the Cincinnati radio ratings. While WIZF rated well, the new ownership stepped into a lacking situation, even though the Cincinnati Enquirer branded it a \\"sleeping giant\\" with a loyal following. The station had no full-time general manager and was lacking in other administrative areas. Blue Chip, which began expanding in 1995 with its purchase of two FM stations in Louisville, Kentucky, grew to 18 stations before Radio One acquired the company and almost all of its stations in 2001 in a $190 million transaction. On July 14, 2006, WIZF changed frequencies from 100.9 FM to 101.1 FM. The move had been ordered by the FCC in 2005 as part of a proceeding that led to other frequency changes in Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky. The principal outcome was that WIFE-FM 100.3 in Connersville, Indiana, could move east to Norwood, Ohio, and into the Cincinnati market; Radio One subsequently purchased the station, which is today WOSL. WIZF has been the Cincinnati affiliate of the Rickey Smiley Morning Show since 2016. Previously, the station aired Russ Parr in mornings; Parr in turn replaced Doug Banks after Radio One opted not to renew the Banks contract in favor of its in-house Parr program. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Station website * Category:Urban One stations IZF Category:Urban contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1965 Category:1965 establishments in Kentucky ","title":"WIZF"},{"id":"5568337","text":"Charles McDonald may refer to: * Charles James McDonald (1793‚Äì1860), politician and jurist from the U.S. state of Georgia * Charles McDonald (Australian politician) (1860‚Äì1925), Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives * Charles McDonald (Canadian politician) (1867‚Äì1936), Saskatchewan MLA and later MP and Senator in the Canadian House of Commons * Charles McDonald (footballer) (1901‚Äì1978), Australian rules footballer for South Melbourne * Charles McDonald (Irish politician) (born 1935), Irish Fine Gael Senator, TD and MEP * Charles McDonald (Louisiana politician) (born 1938), member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1991‚Äì2008 * Charles C.

He was a contemporary and is associated with the life of Saint Sarkis the Warrior and his son, Saint Mardiros. Tiran was the son, successor and was among the children born to Khosrov III KotakKurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.102 by an unnamed mother, thus was a grandson of Tiridates III of Armenia and his wife, Ashkhen. He was the maternal uncle of St. Nerses I who would become a future Catholicos of Armenia. Tiran was named in honor of the monarchs named Tigranes of the Artaxiad Dynasty. The name Tigranes, was the most common royal name in the Artaxiad Dynasty and was among the most ancient names of the Kings of Armenia.Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.48 When his father died in 339, Tiran succeeded his father as King of Armenia. Little is known on life, prior to becoming King of Armenia. Tiran was a lukewarm Christian and was the first Arsacid ruling monarch to aggressively pursue a policy on Arianism.Terian, Patriotism And Piety In Armenian Christianity: The Early Panegyrics On Saint Gregory, p.18 Although Tiran was endorsed by the Christian aristocrats of Armenia, the King was a disappointment, intellectually and morally. The reign of Tiran was blemished by conflicts both internally and externally. Tiran had antagonised the clergy and the great Mamikonian family, who had been the mainstay to the throne. He had many disagreements with the reigning Catholicos and his relation St. Husik I. St. Husik I had criticised Tiran on his public and private conduct. This led Tiran in ordering the death of St. Husik I who was beaten to death on Tiran's orders, because the Catholicos denied him entry to a church in Sophene on a feast day in 347. Tiran massacred two leading Armenian families the Ardzruni and Reshtuni, who he accused in having secret relations with the Sassanids and tried on various occasions which failed to crush the power of the Armenian feudal lordsKurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103 which were among his acts of committed barbarity. In Tiran's foreign policy he was mainly concerned with the Sassanid King Shapur II. Shapur II launched a war on Rome and her allies, firstly by persecuting the Christians that lived in Persia and Mesopotamia. Shapur II's war by capturing these territories began to dealt a severe blow to Roman prestige in the East. Shapur II invaded Armenia with his army and eventually took Tiran, his Queen and their family as hostages. Tiran and his family were betrayed by his chamberlain to Shapur II. Tiran and his family became Sassanid political prisoners, which Tiran was blinded and thrown into prison, after Tiran was accused by Shapur II of collusion with Rome. The Armenian nobles infuriated by the brutality of Shapur II and his treatment of Tiran and his family, took up arms and fought against Shapur II and his army with assistance from the Romans. They successfully drove Shapur II and his army out from Armenia. After Shapur II was defeated, he had signed a treaty and agreed to release Tiran and his family from prison. As Tiran was depressed and blinded, he abdicated his throne and his second son Arsaces II (Arshak II), succeeded him father as Armenian King in 350.

She was a nine-time USA Cycling Junior (18 and under) national champion. As a student at Pennsylvania's Emmaus High School in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, she won three U.S. fitness championships and excelled on Emmaus's cross-country and track teams in the highly competitive East Penn Conference. ==Pan American Games and other championships== After graduating from Emmaus High School in 1994, Reinhart focused on cycling and won two national √©lite track championships and two gold medals at the Pan American Games. In 1999, she signed for Saturn Women's Professional Cycling Team and won nine races that year, followed by another 13 in 2000. ==Death== On September 17, 2000, Reinhart was killed during a 42-mile circuit race held on a 3.5-mile course in Arlington, Massachusetts. Her left pedal and foot hit a concrete curb, and she was thrown from her bicycle and struck a tree. (The accident that killed Wouter Weylandt in May 2011 happened in almost precisely the same manner.) This event was the last of four races comprising the 2000 BMC Software Cycling Grand Prix. She had won the previous three; the organizers offered $250,000 to any rider who won all four. The prize was donated to her family, who established the Nicole Reinhart Foundation in Macungie, Pennsylvania, in her honor. A park or playground at the Cutter School in Arlington, Massachusetts, was named in her honor as a memorial, and dedicated in 2001.

He entered the Navy in 1801 when he was only 12 and by 1815 had become a post Captain, serving on a number of ships. In 1834, Moberly was appointed to be Commandant in control of all operations appertaining to the navy, at the Penetanguishene Naval Yard on Georgian Bay, Canada. Although the naval section of the post was closed in that year, in 1835 Penetanguishene had 40 naval personnel known as a batteaux establishment for the conveyance of provisions, military stores, etc. and a general sale of craft and naval and marine appliances was ordered in 1832 and continued for some time. While stationed in Penetanguishene, Captain Moberley was a major fundraiser for the building of an Anglican church of St. James on-the-Lines in 1837. He was later buried in the graveyard of the church along with his infant daughter, Sophia. ==Family life and heritage== In 1825 Captain Moberly married Miss Mary Fock (a.k.a. Marie Foch), daughter of General Fock of the Russian Imperial Service. She was born in Sebastopol, Crimea, where her father was then stationed. General Fock (a.k.a. Foch or von Fock) was a member of a Polish family of distinction. Of this union were born nine children, six sons and three daughters. Children Mary born at Sowerby, Yorkshire, 1829; married in 1850 Sir Harford Jones-Brydges, Radnorshire, Wales. George, also born at Sowerby in 1830, became a barrister in Collingwood, Ontario and married Fanny Maria, third daughter of the late Col. E. G. O'Brien, Shanty Bay, Ontario. Walter was born at Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire in 1832 and went on to become a civil engineer. Henry was born at Penetanguishene, Ontario in 1835. He entered the Hudson's Bay Company's service in 1854. Clarence was born at Penetanguishene in 1838. Also known as William, Clarence became a civil engineer and was for many years Chief Engineer of the Northern Railway of Canada, from Toronto to Collingwood. He resigned from this position in 1875, to become the contractor of the Northern Extensions Railway to Gravenhurst. Following its completion later that year, he became Chief Engineer of the Ontario & Pacific Junction Railway, which proposed to build a connection from there to the proposed CPR. The O & P J was never built. Clarence W. Moberly died in Collingwood in 1902. Arthur Moberly, born at Penetanguishene in 1840, became a doctor and married Caroline Jean, daughter of J.O.Bouchier of Sutton, Ontario, and died in 1879. Sophia, born at Penetanguishene in 1843, died in infancy, and is commemorated on her father's gravestone. Frank Moberly, born at Barrie in 1845, Civil Engineer. In 1871 he took charge of the government survey from Winnipeg to the Kootenay Plains, at the headwaters of the Athabaska in the Rocky Mountains and engaged in a number of transcontinental railway and exploration surveys both in Canada and the United States, from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island and in the States to California.

The Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy was a 1990s Australian legal and political controversy that involved the clash of local Aboriginal Australian sacred culture and property rights. A proposed bridge to Hindmarsh Island, near Goolwa, South Australia (intended to replace the existing cable ferry and service a proposed marina development) attracted opposition from many local residents, environmental groups and indigenous leaders. In 1994, a group of Ngarrindjeri women elders claimed the site was sacred to them for reasons that could not be revealed. The case attracted much controversy because the issue intersected with broader concerns about Indigenous rights, specifically Aboriginal land rights, in the Australian community at the time, and coincided with the Mabo and Wik High Court cases regarding Native title in Australia. \\"Secret women's business\\", as the group's claims became known, became the subject of intense legal battles. Some Ngarrindjeri women came forward to dispute the veracity of the claims. The Hindmarsh Island Royal Commission found that \\"secret women's business\\" had been fabricated. Subsequently, the Howard Government passed the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act (1997), which allowed construction to go ahead. The bridge was completed in March 2001. In August 2001, a civil case in the Federal Court of Australia re-ignited the debate. In rejecting claims for damages by the developers, Justice John von Doussa stated that he was not satisfied that the claims of \\"secret women's business\\" had been fabricated, although never explicitly stating them to be true. The Ngarrindjeri and their supporters took the decision as a vindication, and many organisations subsequently apologised. Opinion remains divided over the issue to the present day. . ==Background== In 1977, Adelaide developers Tom and Wendy Chapman, trading as Binalong Pty Ltd, purchased of land on Hindmarsh Island in the Murray River estuary and later received planning permission for their company to build a 560-berth marina, car parking, residential development, conference centre, golf course and associated buildings. Wendy Chapman was a former Lord Mayor of Adelaide from 1983 to 1985. With the marina only partially completed, in 1988 the Chapmans applied for permission to increase the size of the project as the original project was found to be financially unviable. The Planning Assessment Commission rejected the proposal, stating that the development couldn't expand unless a bridge was built from Goolwa to Hindmarsh Island as the existing Cable ferry would not be able to handle the increased traffic. In October 1989, approval was granted for a bridge, to be financed by the Chapmans, subject to an Environmental Impact Study (EIS). The EIS (the Edmonds Report) was completed within two weeks and identified the need for an anthropological study. The Chapmans funded a study by Rod Lucas who reported in January 1990 that existing written records did not record mythological sites, but cautioned that consultation with Indigenous groups would be required. Indigenous heritage The Ngarrindjeri are one of the 30‚Äì40 clan-groups (lakinyeri) that inhabited South Australia at the time of white settlement. Originally numbering around 6,000 members they are the only tribe in Australia whose land lay within of a capital city to have survived as a distinct people as recognised in the 2002 Kungun Ngarrindjeri Yunnan Agreement.Protocol Agreement between Alexandrina Council and Ngarrindjeri People Agreements, Treaties and Negotiated Settlements (ATNS) 8 October 2002 In April 1990, the State Minister for Environment and Planning wrote to the Chapmans granting them planning permission for the bridge to Hindmarsh Island and the extensions to their marina. The estimated cost of the bridge was around $6 million which was considerably more than the estimated value of the marina once completed. The planning permission was subject to a number of conditions, including the requirements for consultation with \\"relevant Aboriginal representative bodies\\" such as Ngarrendjeri Elders, the Raukkan Community Council, the Ngarrendjeri Lands and Progress Association, and the Lower Murray Heritage Committee. This was to become an issue in 1994 as the Chapmans had clearly not met these requirements.Hindmarsh Island Royal Commission Background Briefing ABC 17 September 1995 Although the Chapmans had done several environmental impact studies, submitted plans that included the bridge to the Raukkan Community Council and had also consulted with Henry Rankin, a senior Ngarrendjeri Elder, in November 1989 this was prior to the planning permission for the bridge being granted on condition of additional consultation. In the Federal Court hearing in 1994, Wendy Chapman gave evidence that the page of the letter setting out these additional consultation requirements was missing from the Minister's letter she had received (the same recommendations were also included in an assessment sent to the Chapmans by the Department of Environment and Planning). She also stated her belief that as no skeletal remains had been found, no further consultation was required. Government assistance The Hindmarsh Island marina was at this time losing money and the Chapmans were in financial difficulties due to the failure of another marina project they had built at Wellington. They could not afford to construct the bridge themselves so they approached the State Government for assistance. Beneficial Finance, a subsidiary of the state owned State Bank of South Australia, had supplied the financing for the marina development. By 1990 it was obvious that the State Bank was having financial difficulties and The State Labor government led by Premier John Bannon was anxious to protect Beneficial's large investment in the Chapman's projects. The government was also under pressure for a series of major projects it had promised that had never eventuated so the bridge project was also seen as likely to be the only major success Labor would be able to claim for the next election. The State government made a deal with the Chapmans. Binalong would pay up front for the bridge to be built. Then the State government would reimburse Binalong for half of the cost of construction, up to a limit of $3 million. Legal liability In September 1990 Beneficial Finance decided to withdraw funding and the Chapmans approached Partnership Pacific, a subsidiary of Westpac, to take over the financing. Partnership Pacific agreed but only with the condition that the State Government paid the entire cost of the bridge. A secret meeting was arranged between the Chapmans, Westpac and the government at which it was accepted that the government would pay the whole cost of the bridge while the Chapmans would pay back half at a later date, but only after Binalong had paid off all its debts to Westpac. Binalong owed so much money to the State Bank through Beneficial Finance that Bannon apparently had no choice but to prop the company up. The State Bank collapsed not long after with debts of $3 Billion. On 22 November 1990, Premier Bannon wrote a personal letter to the Managing Director of Westpac, Stewart Fowler, guaranteeing government financing of the bridge and in February 1991, Cabinet approved the funding agreement as outlined in the Premier's letter.John Bannon Letter: \\"Dear Mr Fowler, I am willing to put a recommendation to my Cabinet that the government commit immediately to fund the construction of a bridge between Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island on terms previously outlined, including a contribution from Chapman payable subsequent to the repayment of Westpac advances. However, the making of such a recommendation could only be on the basis of having received a commitment from Westpac to finance the marina and residential waterfront development, the details of which have been previously submitted to your bank. Yours sincerely, John Bannon.\\" Initially the government had no liability beyond paying half the cost of the bridge. Unfortunately, Premier Bannon's letter had created an unintended liability for the State government. Not only was the government liable for Westpac's losses if it did not build the bridge but even if the bridge was built and Westpac suffered any losses from stages two, three and four of the marina project, the government was now also liable to cover those losses which could run to hundreds of millions of dollars. A deed was signed in March 1993 binding the government to this commitment. Public outrage at government funding of a project for the sole benefit of private developers, led South Australian Legislative Council member and leader of the Australian Democrats, Mike Elliott, to call for a Parliamentary inquiry into the bridge and the financial arrangements between the government and Westpac. One of its terms of reference dealt specifically with the propriety of the government's decision in conferring private benefits at taxpayers' expense. The inquiries‚Äô findings criticised the financial arrangements between the government, the Chapmans and Westpac, and recommended that the government reconsider the bridge and examine whether the bridge could be replaced by a second ferry. In early October, the Lower Murray Heritage Committee wrote to the Aboriginal Affairs Minister asking him to protect Aboriginal sites on Hindmarsh Island however, work on the bridge began on 27 October 1993 though it quickly ceased due to industrial action. 1993 election Largely due to the financial disaster of the State Bank collapse leaving the state essentially bankrupt, Labor was routed in the December 1993 election and the Liberals came to power with Dean Brown as Premier. When in opposition the Liberals had campaigned against the Hindmarsh Island Bridge and stopping it was a campaign promise during the election. Further up the Murray, the local community in Berri was campaigning for a much-needed bridge to replace their ferry and the government had agreed to build it. Seeking a way out of the Hindmarsh Island contract, Premier Brown hired Samuel Jacobs QC, to carry out an investigation into the legal responsibilities of the contract. Shortly before the 1993 elections the Labor government had instructed archaeologist, Dr Neil Draper, to survey Hindmarsh Island and the mainland foreshore for Aboriginal sites. Justice Jacobs, unaware of Draper's survey, finished his report in early 1994, concluding there was no way out of building the bridge without significant financial liabilities. On 29 April 1994, Draper presented his report to the new Liberal government. The report mentioned that the area had spiritual significance to Aboriginal women, identified a number of significant sites and argued that they should be protected under the State Aboriginal Heritage Act. On 3 May the State Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Dr Michael Armitage, now used his powers under the act to authorise damage to the identified sites if required for the bridge to proceed. Work recommenced and a number of protestors were arrested. It has since been pointed out that Justice Jacobs and the government had missed an opportunity to cancel the bridge contract. They had overlooked that Aboriginal Heritage legislation overrides all contractual obligations. ==Opposition== Many people, including a majority of the islands inhabitants, variously opposed the government funding of a project for the benefit of private developers, the urbanisation of Hindmarsh Island and/or the effects it would have on the natural environment had also voiced their opposition. Initiating legal action in April 1994 they applied to the Federal government for an order prohibiting construction. On 12 May, shortly before construction began, at the request of the Ngarrindjeri, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner issued an emergency declaration blocking work on the bridge, and then appointed a lawyer, Professor Cheryl Saunders OA, to report on the significant Aboriginal sites. Saunders consulted with a range of interested parties, including a group of Ngarrindjeri women who claimed Hindmarsh Island was sacred to them as a fertility site, and for other reasons that could not be publicly revealed. An anthropologist, Dr Deane Fergie, prepared an assessment of the women's claims, which was then submitted to Saunders. As a part of this process some of these cultural secrets were written down and sealed in two envelopes marked Confidential: to be read by women only and forwarded to Tickner with the assessment. On 10 July 1994, Tickner placed a 25-year ban on the bridge construction putting the marina in doubt and bringing the Chapmans close to bankruptcy. (1996) 3(84) Aboriginal Law Bulletin 22. In February 1995 the Chapmans initiated a legal challenge of the ban in the Federal Court. Although the Judge praised Saunders report and criticized the Chapman's litigation, the Judge overturned the ban on a legal technicality.. The media had heavily criticized the ban and focused on Tickner issuing it based on the contents of sealed envelopes that he had never read. In fact Saunders' assessment had stressed that the contents were not needed to reach a decision, as there was enough evidence supporting their contents in the assessment and public domain. In fact, Tickner is on record in the February court case as stating that his decision was not based on the envelopes' contents. In March, Shadow Minister for the Environment Ian McLachlan was forced to resign after tabling some of the secret documents in Parliament misrepresenting how he obtained them and falsely claiming they had not been marked \\"Confidential\\". The envelope had been delivered to McLachlan's office in error and despite being clearly marked \\"Confidential: to be read by women only\\" had been read, photocopied and circulated among both male and female staff. In May 1995 the media and politicians aired the claims of five \\"dissident\\" Aboriginal women who stated that what had become known as \\"secret women's business\\" must have been \\"fabricated\\" by the \\"proponents\\" because they either had no knowledge of the secrets or did not believe them.Promiscuous Sacred Sites: Reflections on Secrecy and Scepticism in the Hindmarsh Island Affair Australian Humanities Review June 1997The women‚Äôs positions were identified by the Royal Commission as \\"Dissidents\\" for those who rejected the secrets and \\"Proponents\\" for those supporting them. Literary circles continue to use those designations. Secret women's business One of the pivotal assertions of \\"secret women's business\\" was that the geography of Hindmarsh Island resembled the female reproductive organs. Hindmarsh Island can be seen in the centre-left of the image. The Royal Commission identified at least twelve separate aspects to the claim of \\"secret women's business\\" during the course of its inquiry. This knowledge was claimed to be of great antiquity, and passed only to a small number of properly initiated women, hence the ignorance of prior anthropologists to the myth. The most prominent aspects of the claims are listed below: *That the island was regarded as a fertility site, as its shape and that of the surrounding wetlands resembled female reproductive anatomy when viewed from the air. It was also suggested that the Ngarrindjeri name for the island, Kumarangk, was similar to the word for pregnancy, or woman. *That the island had to remain separate from the mainland ‚Äì creating a permanent link (such as a bridge) would be \\"as disastrous as if two bodily organs were connected together\\". *That the proposed bridge might interfere with the \\"meeting of the waters\\", the mixing of salt and sea water in the Goolwa estuary, which was believed to be crucial for Ngarrindjeri fertility. *That the waters of the Goolwa channel required uninterrupted views of the sky, particularly the Seven Sisters constellation, which features in several Aboriginal Dreaming stories. The existing barrages, built in the 1930s, were claimed to be acceptable because they did not create a barrier between water and sky. *That the island was a place where aboriginal women went to abort fetuses conceived with white men. This particular practice could not have dated from prior to around 1820, when British whalers began to frequent the area. *Although unrelated to secret women's business, the lower River Murray features prominently in the Ngarrindjeri creation myth. Many of the geographical features of the Fleurieu Peninsula are believed to be remnants of the bodies of creation hero, Ngurunderi, and his wives. *Archaeological evidence suggests that the site was probably used for ritual burials. ==Binalong fails== In 1994, Binalong went into liquidation owing Partnership Pacific $18.5 million with Westpac taking possession of the marina as mortgagee. The marina was at this time valued at up to $1.35 million. Following protracted negotiations, in September 1997 Westpac sold the marina to Kebaro Pty Ltd, a family trust belonging to the Chapmans for $50,000 with a further $1.3 million to follow at a later date. A further assessment of the marina now revised its value to $4.5 million. As part of the transaction, the liquidator of Binalong agreed to assign Binalong's causes of action to Mr and Mrs Chapman who would then pay a percentage of any damages recovered in court to the liquidators. In regards to the financial losses the Chapmans believed had resulted from the heritage applications, the Chapmans claimed financial losses of $16.58 million based on the difference between what the Chapmans paid Westpac and what they claimed the completed marina would have sold for had the bridge been built prior to 1994. In 2001 this court action failed. ==Royal Commission== In June 1995, the Hindmarsh Island Royal Commission was called by the South Australian government. The proponent Ngarrindjeri women were sharply divided. Some believed nothing of the secrets could be revealed for any reason, while others argued that some cultural rules had to be broken in order to protect the area. 23 of the proponent Ngarrindjeri women withdrew from the Royal Commission, rejecting an inquiry into people's spiritual beliefs as unlawful. Those that did attend refused to testify and heckled from the gallery or were otherwise generally disruptive. The 12 dissident women (and one man) by contrast were well behaved. The terms of reference for the Commission implied that the contents of the envelopes were central to the Ministers decision to implement the 25-year ban. The Commission sought clarification from Premier Brown who confirmed the contents were not central. However, the counsel for the dissidents continued to emphasize the importance of knowing what the contents stated. Chief spokesperson for the dissident women, Dorothy Wilson testified to the Royal Commission how she first heard about the \\"secret women's business\\" at a meeting called by the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee. She initially believed the story as Dr. Doreen Kartinyeri was in a position to have secrets passed to her by the female elders. Following the meeting the women went to the local Heritage Committee where the men were. One of the men later pointed to an aerial map of Hindmarsh Island hanging on the wall and commented that it looked like \\"female privates\\". As a map of the island along with the same claim was in the secret envelope, Wilson had second thoughts It just doesn‚Äôt add up to being secret women‚Äôs business if the men actually told us. If our old women didn‚Äôt know about it, well then why did the men tell us about it? I thought it must be a load of nonsense. The premise was that a man should not know what Hindmarsh Island looked like. Kartinyeri later responded that the man shouldn't have said that, because he was a man but that pointing at an aerial map that's been surveyed does not imply that the claim itself was fabricated. None of the dissident women were able to take their claims of fabrication further than their own lack of knowledge of the beliefs. Several admitted that they had no knowledge of any Ngarrindjerri culture or traditions at all. Some admitted that it was not unreasonable for only a limited number of women to be privy to traditional secrets. One took the position that they saw no point in living in the past even if the claims were true. The women all identified themselves as Christians and it has been suggested some saw The Dreamtime as incompatible with their own beliefs, was a Pagan belief and as such, wrong. It had been shown before the Commission that no anthropological work regarding the Ngarrindjeri, specifically Ronald Berndt's authoritative book A World That Was, mentioned the existence of a secret life for Ngarrindjeri women. Cultural geographer Dr Jane Jacobs argued that these publications needed to be seen as a product of their times. In the case of Berndt, we are assuming a male anthropologist walking into an Aboriginal community in the 1940s got the truth. His enquiries were likely not directed towards secrets held by female members of the tribe. Connie Roberts, who was born in 1919 and was one of the elders who had passed the \\"women‚Äôs business\\" on to Doreen Kartinyeri, was asked about talking about such things with an anthropologist: You can't. You're not supposed to talk about things like that. My parents told me, only the old people used to tell certain people.It is a common practice for the elders of Indigenous communities to pass on secrets only to members deemed \\"worthy\\". One of the \\"dissidents\\" testified before the commission that when growing up she did not believe any sacred tribal secrets still existed as she knew of none. In middle age she was told a few secrets and was surprised to find that her husband had already been told them as a boy but could not speak of them in her presence until she had also been told. She also admitted being told by the elders she was not yet ready to receive more. In December, without knowing what was in the envelopes, the Royal Commission found that the idea of Hindmarsh Island as being significant to the Ngarrindjerri women had come about at the meeting of the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee. Despite evidence that mention of the island as a fertility site had been mentioned in 1967, predating the meeting, the Royal Commission found that the secret women's business was a fabrication and hoax. Specifically, the Royal Commission based its finding on five points. The way the secrets were revealed, at the last minute then progressively was suspicious. The lack of mention of the secrets in the anthropological record. The Seven Sisters Dreaming story belonged to the western Aborigines and was never part of the Ngarrindjerri Dreaming. The testimony given by dissidents Dorothy Wilson and Doug Milera supported fabrication and lastly, that the secret women's business was irrational because the barrages were a more intrusive barrier than a bridge could be. ==Heritage applications== The first Section 10 application brought by the so-called \\"proponent women\\" in 1994 under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (CTH) succeeded.. (Cth). On the basis of the Report of Law Professor Cheryl Saunders (1994), Minister Robert Tickner declared a 25-year ban on the building of a bridge. That ban was overturned on a technicality. The veracity of the proponent's women story was not at issue. They had told their story and been believed but the Minister had erred in the manner in which he had dealt with the material. The Ngarrindjeri brought another application under the federal heritage act in 1995‚Äì6. This time Senator Rosemary Crowley appointed a woman judge, Jane Mathews, to be the reporter and thus the proponent women would be able to include knowledge restricted to women without violating their cultural rules. However, the Mathews Report was not able to run its full course. in 1996 the Howard Liberal government came to power and Minister Herron refused to appoint a woman to receive the report. Then, following the Federal Court judgment in Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v Western Australia,. Mathews (1996: 43‚Äì6) made it plain that the women could not rely on material that was not being made available to the other parties most closely affected by the application. Rather than have their stories read by a male minister and made available to other parties, the women withdrew their restricted material. They chose not to violate their religious law that women's knowledge was for women's eyes only. Although this knowledge was missing, the Mathews Report of June 1996 nonetheless acknowledges that the area of the proposed bridge was of significance. The dissident Ngarrindjeri women sought a declaration from the High Court that the nomination of Justice Mathews as the reporter was incompatible with her commission as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. On 6 September 1996, the majority of the court agreed that the appointment of Justice Mathews was invalid.. ==The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act 1997== In part due to the furore over the bridge, Tickner lost his own seat in the 1996 election, at which Labor was heavily defeated by the Coalition under John Howard. Soon after coming to power, the Howard Government legislated to allow the bridge to proceed.Bills Digest 50 1996‚Äì97, Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, Australian Parliamentary Library The Ngarrindjeri challenged the legislation in the High Court on the basis that it was discriminatory to declare that the Heritage Protection Act applied to sites everywhere but on Hindmarsh Island, and that such discrimination ‚Äì essentially on the basis of race ‚Äì had been disallowed since the Commonwealth was granted the power to make laws with respect to the \\"Aboriginal race\\" as a result of the 1967 Referendum. The High Court decided, controversially, in Kartinyeri v Commonwealth that the amended s.51(xxvi) of the Constitution did not restrict the Commonwealth parliament to making laws for the benefit of the \\"Aboriginal race\\", and could in fact enact laws to the detriment of any particular race.. This decision effectively meant that those people who had believed that they were casting a vote against the discrimination of Indigenous people in 1967 had in fact merely allowed the Commonwealth to participate in the discrimination against Indigenous people which had been practised by the States throughout their history.'Wik Bill challenged following Hindmarsh decision', ABC Radio News, 1 April 1998 Racial discrimination has been outlawed by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), but the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act of 1997 expressly removed the Hindmarsh Island area from the purview of the Racial Discrimination Act. ==The von Doussa decision== Justice John von Doussa of the Federal Court heard from all parties to the dispute in the course of the action brought by the Chapmans. In the summary of his Reasons for Decision, von Doussa stated > 5\\\\. This action seeks damages for losses allegedly suffered by Binalong from > five respondents. Mr Tickner is sued as the former Minister. Professor > Cheryl Saunders is sued as the person nominated by Mr Tickner under the > Australian Heritage Protection Act to receive representations from > interested members of the public and to prepare the report required by the > Act concerning the application for protection. Luminis Pty Ltd (Luminis) and > Dr Deane Fergie are sued in respect of their provision of consultancy > services to the ALRM including the preparation of a report containing an > anthropological evaluation of the significance of secret women's knowledge > within Aboriginal tradition to the area where the bridge was to be > constructed. The last respondent is the Commonwealth of Australia which is > sued for compensation on the basis that the declaration under the Heritage > Protection Act resulted in the acquisition of property belonging to > Binalong. Von Doussa found for the respondents. His findings took issue with those of the Royal Commission of 1996 finding that the main bases for the Royal Commission conclusion were not established. In particular, the late emergence of the knowledge did not provide proof of fabrication and is expected in the case of genuine sacred information, lack of recording in the literature was not inconsistent with the material, that it was inappropriate to assert that a particular spiritual belief was irrational, Wilson's testimony was not reliable and Mileras was a personal belief and not evidence of fabrication. Most significantly, the various accounts of the Seven Sisters story given were consistent. He wrote: > 12\\\\. ... the evidence received by the Court on this topic is significantly > different to that which was before the Royal Commission. Upon the evidence > before this Court I am not satisfied that the restricted women's knowledge > was fabricated or that it was not part of genuine Aboriginal tradition. One of the two key independent expert witnesses from the South Australian Museum, Philip Clarke, was found by the Federal Court at [373] to have erred in terms of professional objectivity before the Royal Commission when it was discovered that he had been secretly helping the lawyers for the \\"dissident\\" Ngarrindjerri women. The court found against the developers and dismissed the claims of fabrication. ==Aftermath== Developers Tom and Wendy Chapman and their son Andrew took defamation action against conservation groups, academics, politicians, media operators, printers and individuals who had spoken out against the Bridge. The Chapmans received court judgements of around $850,000 in their favour.. The bulk of the damages related to claims by the defendants that the Chapmans had used SLAPP accusations to silence them.Proving SLAPP accusations in court is almost impossible without an express statement by plaintiffs that they were trying to silence their critics. In the Chapman case the judge rejected the SLAPP accusations, accepted that the injunctions were narrowly directed to specific actions, and found that any silencing of campaigners or the general community was not intended. During the defamation case the defendants relied heavily on the defence of \\"fair comment upon a matter of public interest\\" and the \\"Lange Defence\\" ( ‚Äì the constitutional right to freedom of speech on political matters). However the court found that these defences did not apply because the defendants were motivated by malice which had been proven by the Defendants, being engaged in a \\"campaign\\" to stop the bridge, and the \\"targeting\\" of the Chapmans. The judgement was of concern to environmental activists because any form of direct action such as non-violent picketing, boycotting, or attempts to coerce changes of policy or behaviour, while not illegal, could be imputed as \\"malice\\" in any resulting defamation claim. As a result of the Chapman defamation actions, the Environmental Defenders Office has called for the introduction of a \\"Protection of Public Participation Act\\" for South Australia. Based on North American legislation, the proposed Act would ensure that those engaged in non-violent public participation would be protected from threats or suits that infringe free speech. In early 2002, Peter Sutton, a former head of Anthropology of the South Australian Museum, who had been unable to take a position on the claims, stated that additional evidence discovered since the von Doussa judgement had changed his view. \\"I still allow that aspects of these beliefs may have been embellished or given greater weight than before ... but the patterns and matches with earlier materials on some strands makes the overall fabrication theory insupportable.\\" In September 2002, redevelopment of the Goolwa wharf, which lay adjacent the Hindmarsh Island bridge, unearthed the remains of an Aboriginal woman and child. The site had been claimed to have been a burial ground by the proponent Ngarrindjeri women during the Royal Commission. However, the Alexandrina Council decided that as the wharf was South Australia's first inland port, colonial history should take preference over Ngarrindjeri interests and construction went ahead. Legal action was contemplated but after negotiations, the Alexandrina Council formally apologised to the Ngarrindjeri and entered into a Kungun Ngarrindjeri Yunnan (\\"Listen to Ngarrindjeri Speaking\\") agreement where the Council acknowledged Ngarrindjeri rights as the traditional owners of the country and their existence as an identifiable group of people with their own laws, customs, beliefs and traditions which must be taken into consideration for any developments within the council area where the Ngarrindjeri may have rights, interests or obligations. On 7 July 2010, in a ceremony at the foot of the bridge, the Government of South Australia endorsed the finding that \\"secret women's business\\" was genuine. Ngarrindjeri elders then led a symbolic walk across the bridge. Elders now believe it is acceptable for Ngarrindjeri people to use the bridge to gain access to their land and waters, but culturally and morally still reject the bridge. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Bell, Diane (ed.)

The awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Or√©al and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and carry a grant of $100,000 USD for each laureate.Kevin Friedl, \\"For Women in Science \\", Seed Magazine, March 8, 2006 Each year an international jury alternates between life and material sciences and selects a winner from each of the following regions: * Africa and the Middle East. * Asia-Pacific * Europe * Latin America and the Caribbean * North America (since 2000) The same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Or√©al International Fellowships, providing up to $40,000 USD in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects. The Fellowship awards began in 2000 with a one-year award of US$20,000 and offered ten awards until 2003. In 2003, the number of awards increased to 15 and then in 2006, the grant period extended to two years and the amount of the award increased to US$40,000. In 2015, the name Rising Talent Grants was implemented. == Recipients ==  1998 Laureates  * Grace Oladunni Taylor (Nigeria): Biochemistry * Myeong-Hee Yu (South Korea): Microbiology * Pascale Cossart (France): Bacteriology * Gloria Montenegro (Chile): Botany  2000 Laureates  * Valerie Mizrahi (South Africa): Molecular biology * Tsuneko Okazaki (Japan): Molecular biology * Margarita Salas (Spain): Molecular biology * Eugenia Mar√≠a del Pino Veintimilla (Ecuador): Molecular biology * Joanne Chory (United States): Molecular biologyDNA researcher Okazaki wins int'l award for female scientists., the Free Library, 5 April 2015  2000 Fellows  2000 Fellowships awarded yearly to doctoral and post-doctoral women to allow them to pursue their research in host laboratories outside their home countries are:  2001 Laureates  * Adeyinka Gladys Falusi (Nigeria): Molecular genetics * Suzanne Cory (Australia): Molecular genetics * Anne McLaren (United Kingdom): Reproductive biology * Mayana Zatz (Brazil): Molecular biology * Joan Argetsinger Steitz (United States): Molecular biophysics and biochemistry  2001 Fellows  2001 Fellowships awarded yearly to doctoral and post- doctoral women to allow them to pursue their research in host laboratories outside their home countries are:  2002 Laureates  * Nagwa Meguid (Egypt): Genetics applied to the prevention of mental diseases * Indira Nath (India): The treatment of leprosy * Mary Osborn (Germany): Methods for the observation of cell structures * Ana Mar√≠a L√≥pez Colom√© (Mexico): Prevention of blindness. * Shirley Tilghman (Canada, United States): Gene expression and parental origin of chromosomes  2002 Fellows  2002 Fellowships awarded yearly to doctoral and post-doctoral women to allow them to pursue their research in host laboratories outside their home countries are:  2003 Laureates  * Karimat El-Sayed (Egypt): Physics * Li Fanghua (China): Electron microscopy * Ayse Erzan (Turkey): Condensed matter physics * Mariana Weissmann (Argentina): Computational condensed matter physics * Johanna M.H.

It has originated in Brazil, in the city of Birig√ºi, in the 1960s by Prof. Dario Miguel Pedro. It showed up as a group game and as an alternative to the practice and the learning of swimming. It is the newest sports modality in Brazil and the only group sport genuinely Brazilian, born and instituted inside the country. ==Field== Biribol field Its game is played inside a pool which size is 8m length, 4m width and 1.30m depth (the depth must be this for the entire pool) with a net in the middle of the pool with 2.62m high for the male and with 2.40m high for the female practice. The game space is constituted by 7m high measured from the surface of the water. There is also an attack area, delimited by a line which cross the pool by 1.25m from where the net is in each side. There are lines that delimit the service area, by the end of the pool, 1m from its length limit and other 0.8m from its width limit. ==Rules== Game ball The ball is specially crafted ball similar to that of water polo but with a smaller diameter. The ball weights approximately 100 grams more than the volleyball one and employs a \\"super grip\\" surface technology. The official game is played with four players on each side, but there is also the doubles modality, with two players on each side. Biribol is a highly recommended sport for working all muscle groups with practically no injury risks due to its no contact, low impact on joints nature. Biribol is also suited for all ages and genders, and is recommended for people with minor chronic injuries that feel discomfort or pain while playing other sports. Game play Matches are decided in best-of-three or best-of-five sets of 21 points, when the matches go up to the last set this set is disputed up to the 20th point instead, and a team needs at least two points of advantage in any circumstance to win a set. So if a 21-points set is drawn at 20x20, the match is extended to 22 points, and so on. S√£o Paulo The ball can be touched with any part of the player's body, with open or closed hands. The pool's inside borders are neutral, meaning the ball is normally in play after touching them, points are scored when the ball hits the water in the opponents' side or the opponent team commits a fault. As in volleyball, each team can contact the ball no more than three times before the ball crosses the net, while consecutive contacts must be made by different players - except for contacts while blocking, which are not counted. Players also cannot touch the net or they commit a fault and a point is awarded to the opponent team. Unique to the sport is that there is no penetration under and over the net - it is even allowed to block a set being executed in the opponents' side -, the possibility of blocking serves and how there is no lifting (carrying) faults during spikes. With its fast moving, highly accurate ball and 'closed quarters' action, Biribol is also an extremely competitive sport and enjoys a popularity similar to or greater than water volleyball in southern Brazil. There is currently a Brazilian National League with teams from S√£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias and Paran√°. There are many stages held in different cities of the country, and the Brazilian champion is known in the end of the year, after computing all points of the season. The sport has been reckoned officially in the state of S√£o Paulo, and grows rapidly in the country. ==NotesExternal links== *Brazilian Biribol Association Category:Water sports Category:Team sports Category:Ball games Category:Sports originating in Brazil ","title":"Biribol"},{"id":"5568482","text":"Forrest Scott Kline (born November 7, 1983, in Ashland, Oregon) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and guitarist.

In 1987, age 30 Kroger was elected as the president of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party of Australia and was president until 1992, becoming the longest serving president in the Victorian Division's history. He instituted a series of reforms, including a move to increase the power of the party executive in preselections. While this led to several preselection challenges in 1988 and 1989 (most notably Costello's successful challenge against Roger Shipton in Higgins), it also helped in the election of several young Victorian federal parliamentarians who are widely considered to have bright futures although, as of 2005, this pattern had not been replicated at state level.The Age: Doyle's choice: Dads Army or new blood (11 March 2005) Kroger himself often turned down opportunities to run in blue ribbon Liberal seats, notably Kooyong in 1994 and in Goldstein in 2004, preferring to concentrate on family and business interests.Poll Bludger: Federal Election 2004 Victoria From the 1990s the Victorian division of the Liberal Party was factionalized between Kroger's supporters and those of the more conservative former Premier, Jeff Kennett. This has led to some bruising preselections, such as the Kennett-backed Louise Asher defeating the Kroger and Costello- backed Mitch Fifield in Brighton in 1999.AM: Kennett wins factional battle However, both backed Petro Georgiou when he was challenged for his preselection by Josh Frydenberg in 2006.ABC Online News: Georgiou win unrelated to refugee policy: Costello However, Peter Costello is no longer factionally aligned with Kroger.https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/liberal-leadership-battle- between-michael-obrien-and-matthew-guy-the-lightning-rod-for-factional- fallouts-20141130-11x2lz.html In 1993 Kroger established an investment company, JT Campbell & Co, and currently serves as chairman. He has also spent five years (1998 to 2003) as a director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In May 2012 he very publicly expressed concern over matters relating to Peter Costello's apparent idea of returning to the Federal Liberal parliamentary party. Kroger's former wife, Helen Kroger, was demoted on the Liberal Party senate ticket and was almost facing a challenge by some Liberal for the Senate whip position. Costello has said that Kroger asked him for help regarding Helen Kroger's troubles with the Liberal party, though Costello decided not to help. Kroger was nominated to become state president of the Victorian Liberal party for the second time. Tony Snell stood down as state president at the Liberal state council in March 2015 and Kroger was elected his successor.http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/michael-kroger-set-to-become- president-of-victorian-liberal-party-20150121-12v12j.html Kroger was challenged in 2017 for the Liberal party presidency by Peter Reith.

Michael Kroger retained the party presidency by a vote of 721-448 against former Vice President Greg Hannan.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/kroger-wins/news- story/eac32642c1cea692d84c2425d96a383b In 2018, Kroger declared his intention to not seek another term as Liberal President.https://www.afr.com/news/politics/liberal-party-prodigy-marcus- bastiaan-plans-to-succeed-michael-kroger-20180628-h11zfd He retired as State President of the Liberal Party on 30 November 2018 after the Coalition's landslide defeat in the 2018 Victorian state election. == Private life == Kroger‚Äôs first wife Helen Kroger was elected to the Senate for Victoria at the 2007 election after being preselected in the safe second position on the Liberal ticket, along with the aforementioned Mitch Fifield and number three candidate Scott Ryan. Senator Kroger lost her Senate seat at an election in 2013 and in 2016 for the seat of Bruce. Despite their divorce, Michael and Helen remain close friends and are considered to be political allies. Kroger married Ann Peacock, daughter of Andrew Peacock and Susan Renouf, in March 1999 at St Michael's Uniting Church, in Collins St, Melbourne. They separated in 2009. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Australian financial businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Melbourne Category:Australian people of German descent Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:People educated at Wesley College (Victoria) Category:Monash Law School alumni Category:Board members of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ","title":"Michael Kroger"},{"id":"5568565","text":"We the People (1952).

He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the New York Yankees from through . Bevins is notable for his performance in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series when he came within one out from throwing what would have been the first no-hitter in World Series history. ==Baseball career== Bevens signed with the New York Yankees at 20 in , and spent seven seasons in their minor league system, throwing two no-hitters for the Wenatchee Chiefs before making his major league debut with the Yankees on May 12, at the age of 27. In his third minor league season, he pitched his first no-hitter on September 21, 1939, against the Tacoma Tigers, winning 8-0 with the only opposing baserunner reaching on an error, giving his Wenatchee Chiefs their first playoff win after losing the first three games of the series to Tacoma. Bevens pitched for four years in the Yankees' minor league farm system before they brought him up to the majors, where he attained a career record of 40‚Äì36 with a 3.08 earned run average. His best year was , when he went 16‚Äì13 and 2.23. However, in the season, his last year in the majors, he won only seven and lost 13. For 8 innings in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series Bevens had held the Dodgers hitless despite giving up a World Series record ten walks. The Yankees were nursing a 2‚Äì1 lead. With one out to go for the first no-hitter in Series history, he walked right fielder Carl Furillo and then (intentionally) pinch-hitter Pete Reiser. Dodger manager Burt Shotton sent in Al Gionfriddo to pinch-run for Furillo and Eddie Miksis for the injury-slowed Reiser, and aging Cookie Lavagetto to pinch-hit for leadoff man Eddie Stanky. With two outs and two on in the bottom of the ninth, Lavagetto swung and missed for strike one but then on Bevens' second (and last) pitch lined a double off the right field wall scoring both runners and winning the game for the Dodgers 3-2 with their only hit. On October 6, Bevens returned to the mound for 2 innings of scoreless early relief in the deciding Game 7, helping the Yankees to win the world championship.

On the floor at the collegiate level the 6'4\\" Conner was a \\"swingman,\\" playing both the shooting guard and small forward positions, earning high collegiate honors as the 1982 Pac-10 Player of the Year. Conner was the 14th selection in the first round of the 1982 NBA Draft, selected by his hometown Golden State Warriors, for whom he played the first four years of his 12-season NBA career. In the NBA Conner was a \\"combo guard,\\" playing both the shooting guard and point guard positions. His NBA career was interrupted by one year played with the league champion Rapid City Thrillers of the Continental Basketball Association. Following his retirement at the end of the 1994-95 season, Conner turned his attention to coaching, beginning as an assistant to Boston Celtics head coach Rick Pitino in 1998 and continuing for more than 15 years. ==Biography== Lester Conner was born September 17, 1959 in Memphis, Tennessee. He grew up in Oakland, California, where he attended the ethnically diverse Fremont High School.K.J. White, Miller's Time: A Legacy of OSU Basketball, 1971-1989. Portland, OR: Highland Times Press, 1997; pg. 65. Although he played high school basketball for the Fremont Tigers, he was far from a star at the time, starting sporadically. No elite collegiate basketball programs beat down his door and Conner found himself relegated to pursuing an alternate path forward in his chosen sport. ==Collegiate career== Junior College In 1978, Conner enrolled at Los Medanos Junior College in Pittsburg, California, where his game expanded dramatically. Conner achieved star status, averaging 25.2 points per game in leading his team to a 24-7 record. He moved on to Chabot Junior College in Hayward, California for the 1979-80 season, achieving similar results in becoming the co-recipient of the California Junior College Player of the Year honors. From being a largely unheralded high school player, Conner found himself a blue chip prospect as a transfer player, pursued by some of the leading collegiate programs in America. 1980-81 One chief suitor included Jerry Tarkanian, head coach of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, whose program Conner found attractive. Another was Oregon State University, a program headed by gruff veteran head coach Ralph Miller, a future member of the Basketball Hall of Fame. Conner requested that Miller travel to see him play in person, a bold request that one writer has likened to \\"asking the Pope to say grace at Thanksgiving dinner.\\"The quote is that of K. J. White in Miller's Time, pg. 65. Nevertheless, Miller acceded to Conner's wishes and ultimately won Conner's commitment to take a scholarship with the program nearly a month after the end of the April signing period. Conner quickly won a starting role with the team, opening up the 1980-81 season playing small forward next to future NBA players Steve Johnson, Mark Radford, Ray Blume, and Charlie Sitton.White, Miller's Time, pg. 63. The team was regarded from opening day as one of the powers of college basketball, bringing back the nucleus of a team that had finished the previous year with a record of 26-4 as the 5th ranked team in America. Conner would produce for much of the year off the bench as an invaluable sixth man, gaining notice as a highly skilled passer, gritty rebounder, and lock-down defensive specialist.White, Miller's Time, pg. 69. Seven wins out the gate brought the Beavers a #2 national ranking, which soon became #1 when Oregon State kept winning while the previously top-ranked DePaul Blue Demons fell to Old Dominion, 63-62, on January 10, 1981.White, Miller's Time, pg. 66. The DePaul result was announced in the midst of an OSU annihilation of the Cal Golden Bears, with the home team up 56-28, bringing the crowd of 10,087 to a deafening standing ovation lasting more than a minute.White, Miller's Time, pg. 67. The 1980-81 Beavers flirted with perfection, going 26-0 before suffering a shocking 20 point home loss to Alton Lister, Fat Lever, and the 24-3 Arizona State Sun Devils to close the year.White, Miller's Time, pg. 71. The season would then end in unmitigated disaster with a crushing early loss to Kansas State, 64-60, in the 1981 NCAA Tournament. Conner would finish the year fourth on the team in scoring, with an average of 7.0 points per game, and pulling down 119 rebounds ‚Äî second on the Beavers to star 6'11\\" center Steve Johnson.\\"1980-81 Oregon State Beavers Roster and Stats,\\" Sports- Reference.com/ 1981-82 Conner's senior season, 1981‚Äì82, looked like trouble for Oregon State, with both guards and center Steve Johnson leaving for the NBA, along with two rotation players, with those lost needing to be replaced by athletes of clearly lesser talent. Fully 71% of the offense from OSU's previous season was erased by the loss of the departures, along with 53% of the team's rebounds.White, Miller's Time, pg. 74. The arch-rival UCLA Bruins entered the year with a #2 ranking; expectations for OSU to repeat as conference champions were extremely low. The Beavers had a new tool in the kit, however, with the addition of an acclaimed 6'8\\" freshman from Benson High School in Portland named A.C. Green, who narrowly chose OSU over coach George Raveling and Washington State University.White, Miller's Time, pp. 74-75. Together with the maturation and improvement of pesky defensive guard William Brew and angular small forward Danny Evans, and the return of the versatile Charlie Sitton, the Beavers found themselves with a more than capable roster that racked up a Pac-10 conference record of 16-2 en route to a third straight conference title.White, Miller's Time, pg. 73. Conner played mostly at the 2-guard position during his senior year, while frequently sharing the chore of advancing the ball against pressure. He proved his mettle as a passer, finishing the season as the Pac-10's leader in assists, with an average of 5.1 assists per game.White, Miller's Time, pg. 81. While the over-achieving Beavers again found themselves knocked out of the NCAA Tournament before they were ready, they won games in their first two rounds before running into Patrick Ewing, Sleepy Floyd, and the Georgetown Hoyas and a 24-point drubbing. Conner would finish the year as the team's scoring leader, with an average of 14.6 points per game, as well as the team's rebounding leader, with 145 boards ‚Äî topping power forward A.C. Green's total of 141.\\"1981-82 Oregon State Beavers Roster and Stats,\\" Sports-Reference.com/ During his two years as a Beaver, Conner helped lead the team to a record of 52 wins and 6 losses, a winning percentage of .897.\\"Lester Conner,\\" NBA Coach File, www.nba.com/ Conner was voted the 1982 Pac-10 Player of the Year, following his Oregon State teammate Steve Johnson as recipient of the award,White, Miller's Time, pg. 91. and was tapped as a 1982 AP All-American. He was remembered by OSU boss Ralph Miller as one of the top five defensive players he coached during his 38-season career. ==Professional career== Conner was drafted in 1982 as the 14th pick overall, by the Golden State Warriors, and played with the Warriors for 4 seasons. He would later play for the Houston Rockets, and serve two stints with both the New Jersey Nets and the Milwaukee Bucks, finishing his NBA career with the Los Angeles Clippers, the Indiana Pacers, and the Los Angeles Lakers. He ended his NBA playing days in 1995. He earned the nickname \\"The Molester\\" for his ball-stealing defensive play.\\"Lester Conner,\\" BasketballReference.com, www.basketball-reference.com/ ==Coaching career== Conner began his NBA coaching career in 1998 as an assistant to head coach Rick Pitino of the Boston Celtics.Michael Cunningham, \\"Conner Adds His Voice to Hawks,\\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Oct. 14, 2010. Conner credits Pitino with teaching him to project his voice from the bench, shouting instructions that cut through the din of an NBA arena. He also was twice the assistant coach in Milwaukee for head coach Terry Stotts, leaving after Stotts was fired following the 2006-2007 season. Conner is considered a protege of former Indiana Pacers head coach Jim O'Brien and has worked under O'Brien on three separate occasions. The first was with the Boston Celtics from 2001-04. The second was as the associate head coach for the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2004-05 season. In June, 2007, Conner moved to Indiana, to once again work for O'Brien and the Pacers. On Feb. 2, 2010, taking over for one game for an absent O'Brien, Lester Conner instituted a few strategic changes such as moving Roy Hibbert closer to the basket and emphasizing an attacking, uptempo style preferred by the players. The Pacers scored what turned out to be a season-high 130 points in a 15-point victory amid their 32-50 season. In 2010, Conner joined Larry Drew as his top assistant at the Atlanta Hawks, leaving the team following Drew's termination at the end of the 2012-13 NBA Season. Conner joined the Denver Nuggets for the 2013-14 season as an assistant coach. Conner has expressed an interest in returning to his alma mater, Oregon State University, as a head coach, but was informed in 2014 by Beaver Athletic Director Bob De Carolis of the university's unwillingness to make the job available to him due to Conner's lack of a college degree.Connor Letourneau, \\"Beavers Great Lester Conner Loses Sleep Over Oregon State Head Coaching Vacancy,\\" The Oregonian, May 13, 2014. Conner expressed lament at the university's refusal to consider him for what he called \\"the only university job I want\\" owing to lack of academic qualification. \\"I understand the importance of having the degree,\\" Conner told an interviewer from the Portland Oregonian in May 2014. \\"But at the same time, that doesn't define who I am or what I am as a coach and as a person.\\" ==Footnotes External links == * \\"Lester Conner,\\" BasketballReference.com * NBA bio - Lester Conner * \\"Interview with Lester Conner,\\" Albany Democrat-Herald, March 17, 2016.

Plastino also worked as a comics writer, editor, letterer, and colorist. With writer Otto Binder, he co-created the DC characters Supergirl and Brainiac, as well as the teenage team the Legion of Super-Heroes. == Biography == Early life and career Born at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in Manhattan, New York City, on December 15, 1921, and raised in The Bronx, Plastino was interested in art since grade school. He attended the School of Industrial Art in New York City, and afterward began illustrating for Youth Today magazine. He was accepted into the college Cooper Union but chose to continue working as a freelance artist. His earliest known credited comic-book work is as penciler-inker of the Dynamic Man and Major Victory superhero features and Green Knight medieval-adventure story in Dynamic Publications' Dynamic Comics #2 (cover- dated Dec. 1941). Before the war, Plastino inked some issues of Captain America Comics.Plastino bio, \\"Living Legends,\\" New York Comic-Con program booklet #4 (Reed Exhibitions, 2009), p. 14. With the outbreak of World War II, Plastino and his brothers were drafted, and he served in the U.S. Army. There, a sketch he had made for a model airplane he had designed caught an officer's attention, leading to his being assigned to Grumman Aerospace Corporation, the National Inventors Council, and then The Pentagon. He was assigned there to the Adjutant General's office, where he designed war posters and field manuals. After his discharge he began working for Steinberg Studios, drawing Army posters. Comics While working out of a studio in New York City with two other cartoonists in 1948, Plastino showed sample art of Superman to DC Comics, which offered him work at $35 a page. Plastino, who had heard that Superman artists were receiving $55 a page, negotiated a $50 rate. Now settled in the comic book field, he largely dropped other commercial work for two decades. Early on at DC, Plastino was forced to copy Wayne Boring's style but gradually began using his own style. He did 48 Superman covers as well as countless DC stories. Plastino and writer Bill Finger produced the story for Superman #61 (Nov. 1949) in which kryptonite, which had originated on The Adventures of Superman radio program, made its way into the comic books. He drew the Lois Lane feature in Showcase #9 (Aug. 1957) which served as a tryout for the character's own series.Irvine, Alex \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 85: \\"The future title Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane got a tryout in issues #9 and #10 of Showcase, when Lois Lane stepped in as the lead feature. The lead story in Showcase #9, 'The Girl in Superman's Past', by writer Jerry Coleman and artist Al Plastino, introduced Lois Lane to Superman's old flame Lana Lang.\\" Plastino worked on several titles within the Superman family of comics, including Superboy and Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane. Plastino drew the Superboy story in Adventure Comics #247 (April 1958) that introduced the Legion of Super-Heroes, a teen superhero team from the future that eventually became one of DC's most popular features;Irvine \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 89: \\"The Legion of Super-Heroes would become one of DC's most enduring and popular groups despite their humble beginnings, in a story by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino.\\" with writer Otto Binder, Plastino co-created the first Legion characters, Cosmic Boy, Lightning Lad (as Lightning Boy) and Saturn Girl. Binder and Plastino debuted the villain Brainiac and the Bottle City of Kandor in Action Comics #242 (July 1958).Irvine \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 90: \\"The mythology of Krypton expanded dramatically with the introduction of the evil Brainiac and the Bottle City of Kandor in the Action Comics #242 story 'The Super-Duel in Space', written by Otto Binder and [drawn by] artist Al Plastino\\" The two men co-created Supergirl in Action Comics #252 (May 1959). Plastino drew the first appearance of the supervillain the Parasite in Action Comics #340 (Aug. 1966).McAvennie, Michael \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 118: \\"With a story written by Jim Shooter and drawn by Al Plastino, the Parasite entered Superman's life.\\" Plastino's \\"greatest pride\\"' was a story he drew for Superman #168 (April 1964, scheduled for publication Feb. 1964), titled \\"Superman's Mission for President Kennedy.\\"\\"Superman's Mission for President Kennedy\\" at the Grand Comics Database The piece was done in collaboration with the Kennedy administration to help promote the president's national physical fitness program. In the story, Superman visits the White House, and trusts President John F. Kennedy with his secret identity. The story was produced shortly before Kennedy was assassinated, which led to the cancellation of its publication. At the behest of President Lyndon B. Johnson, it was published two months later, in Superman #170 (June 1964), with Plastino adding a title page showing a ghostly figure of Kennedy looking down from the heavens at Superman flying over Washington, D.C. Plastino had always believed the artwork had been donated to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, but the artwork was placed on auction by a private entity in late 2013. DC Entertainment subsequently purchased the art and donated it to the Library. In the early 1970s, DC Comics, fearing Jack Kirby's versions of Superman and Jimmy Olsen were too different from their established representations, assigned Plastino (among other artists) to redraw those characters' heads in Kirby's various titles. In 1996, Plastino was one of the many artists who contributed to the Superman: The Wedding Album one-shot wherein the title character married Lois Lane.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 275: \\" The behind-the-scenes talent on the monumental issue appropriately spanned several generations of the Man of Tomorrow's career. Written by Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, David Michelinie, Louise Simonson, and Roger Stern, the one-shot featured the pencils of John Byrne, Gil Kane, Stuart Immonen, Paul Ryan, Jon Bogdanove, Kieron Dwyer, Tom Grummett, Dick Giordano, Jim Mooney, Curt Swan, Nick Cardy, Al Plastino, Barry Kitson, Ron Frenz, and Dan Jurgens.\\" Comic strips Plastino drew the syndicated Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder comic strip from March 17, 1968 to January 1, 1972 and was the uncredited ghost artist on the Superman strip from 1960 to 1966. In 1970, he took over the syndicated strip Ferd'nand, which he drew until his retirement in 1989. Plastino also worked on Sunday episodes of Nancy from 1982 to 1983 after Ernie Bushmiller died. Plastino's official website says the artist was commissioned by the United Media newspaper syndicate to ghost Peanuts when Charles Schulz underwent heart surgery in 1983, but David Michaelis, author of Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography, revealed that syndicate president William C. Payette had hired Plastino to draw a backlog of Peanuts strips during contract negotiations with Schulz in the 1970s. When Schulz and the syndicate reached a successful agreement, United Media stored these unpublished strips, the existence of which eventually became public. == Personal life == Plastino lived for many years in Shirley, New York, on Long Island.

Its source is at Knik Glacier, from which it flows northwest and west and empties into the head of Cook Inlet's Knik Arm, near the mouth of the Matanuska River. It is bridged twice (old and new bridges) where the Old Glenn Highway crosses it near the Butte, and also bridged on the Hayflats. It is characterized by a broad flat plain with a bed of finely ground gravel and sand and silt. During windstorms, large quantities of fine material is blown from the riverbed and deposited in locations generally downstream or west. The river itself is relatively shallow and wide and considered a class I float. It drops about from the glacier to the salt water, or roughly per mile. The above the hayflats bridge is unusual in that it remains unfrozen most winters because the eklutna project discharges warmer water into the tailrace. Discharge normally is about 5000 to 6000 ft3/s in the summer (140 to 170 m3/s), with floods of 60,000cfs or more not uncommon. The term \\"knik,\\" present in the names of the river, the arm of Cook Inlet, and the glacier, as well as the communities of Knik-Fairview and Knik River, derives from the Inupiaq word igniq (\\"fire\\"). The Denaina term for the Knik river was \\"Skitnu\\", (meaning Brush River) though this is now archaic, and not commonly used. The river runs near the border between the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the Municipality of Anchorage. Much of its length is paralleled by the paved Old Glenn Highway and the paved (as of 2000) Knik River Road, along which can be found the community of Knik River. ==See also== *List of rivers of Alaska ==References== Category:Rivers of Anchorage, Alaska Category:Rivers of Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska Category:Rivers of Alaska ","title":"Knik River"},{"id":"5568612","text":"Igor Kipnis (September 27, 1930January 23, 2002) was a well-known American harpsichordist, pianist and conductor. ==Biography== The son of Metropolitan Opera bass Alexander Kipnis, he was born in Berlin, where his father was singing with the Berlin State Opera. Although Jewish, the elder Kipnis was popular in Germany during Nazism's rise to prominence. Employing the stratagem of a vocal injury, the elder Kipnis fled Germany for Austria. When the Nazis annexed that country, the family was touring Australia. From there they moved to the US in 1938. He learned the piano with his maternal grandfather, Heniot Levy; attended the Westport School of Music, and received his B.A. from Harvard University, where he served as the program director of WHRB, Harvard's undergraduate radio station. He studied harpsichord with Fernando Valenti, and made his concert debut in New York in 1959. He was an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa (Harvard, 1977), and in 1993 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by Illinois Wesleyan University. Kipnis lived in Redding, Connecticut. For five years he was president and artistic director of the Friends of Music of Fairfield County, the Connecticut chamber music series, in addition to having served thirteen years as co-artistic director of the Connecticut Early Music Festival. Dr. Kipnis was also a member of the faculty of Fairfield University in the early 1970s, teaching between tours. He married Judith Robison on January 6, 1953. Their son, Jeremy R. Kipnis, became a film and record producer. Igor and Judith Kipnis divorced in May 1996, but reconciled shortly before her death on March 1, 2001. He died in his home in Redding, Connecticut, of renal cancer. His last concert was a solo piano recital in October 2001, in San Francisco. ==Musical career== Following his debut in 1959, harpsichordist, fortepianist, duo-pianist, and clavichordist Kipnis performed in recital and as soloist with orchestras throughout the world, including North, Central, and South America, Western and Eastern Europe, Israel, and Australia. Igor Kipnis performed as harpsichord soloist with the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Louisville, Dallas, Denver, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Seattle, Vancouver, Honolulu, and National Symphonies, the Minnesota Orchestra, the Capella Cracoviensis, the Boston Pops, the Munich Philharmonic, the New Amsterdam Sinfonietta, the Los Angeles, St. Paul, Cologne, Israel, New Stockholm, McGill, and Polish Chamber Orchestras, the New York Chamber Symphony, the Smithsonian Chamber Players, the Sinfonia of Sydney, and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. His appearances at international and domestic festivals included Bachwoche Ansbach, the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart, and Ludwigsburg in Germany, the Bath Festival in Great Britain, Gulbenkian in Portugal, Lanaudi√®re in Canada, the Israel Festival, the Melbourne International Festival of Organ and Harpsichord, the Madeira Bach Festival, Poland's Music in Old Crakow, the Indianapolis Early Music Festival, and Prague Spring International Music Festival. Kipnis's enormous harpsichord repertoire encompassed not only the traditional 16th through the 18th Century composers but also includes contemporary music and jazz as well. He is especially noted for his entertaining concert-length presentation, The Light and Lively Harpsichord, which samples the full range of the harpsichord repertoire, from Bach to Brubeck, as well as for his informal mini-concerts whose format he has extensively pioneered at college student centers throughout the United States, and, additionally, for his performances and recordings on related early keyboard instruments, the fortepiano and clavichord, and for directing ensembles from the keyboard. In 1995, he formed a duo with New York pianist Karen Kushner, internationally performing works for (modern) piano, four hands. ==Broadcasting== A frequent guest on both television and radio, such as the syndicated program First Hearing, Kipnis for three seasons hosted his own The Age of Baroque over WQXR in New York and was host on WGBH-Boston's syndicated program, The Classical Organ. In 1978, he was the first harpsichordist to perform on the Grammy Awards telecast. ==Editions, reviews and articles== Oxford University Press has published numerous of his keyboard editions, including his anthology, A First Harpsichord Book. He was also noted for his record reviews and articles in such periodicals as The International Classic Record Collector, The International Piano Quarterly, Gramophone Early Music, Goldberg, Early Music America, the internet music magazines Music & Vision and Stereo Times, Stereophile, Audio, FI, Schwann/Opus, Stereo Review, The American Record Guide, Clavier, Opus, Chamber Music Magazine, Early Keyboard Studies Newsletter, and The Yale Review, as well as having written for The Washington Post, the New York Post, and the New York Herald Tribune. He was also involved in compiling A Harpsichord Resource Book for Greenwood Press, and editing the harpsichord and clavichord volume of a three-volume set ‚Äì Encyclopedia of Keyboard Instruments, of which the harpsichord and clavichord volume was published in 2007, Routledge published the set ‚Äì vol.1 The Piano (2003); vol.2 The Organ (2006); and Kipnis's vol.3 The Harpsichord and Clavichord (2007). Kipnis also wrote Instruments writing A Harpsichord Tutor for Oxford University Press, and, for Amadeus Press, preparing a biography of his father, the late Metropolitan Opera bass, Alexander Kipnis. He was also for a time responsible for the covers and background sleeve notes for Westminster Records.Obituary 'Farewell to friends'.

The series revolves around two slackers, mechanic Coop (David DeLuise) and his best friend Jamie (Steven Blum), who find a mecha robot from the future called Megas (Mechanized Earth Guard Attack System) in a New Jersey junkyard. Coop modifies Megas and replaces his head, the control center, with a classic muscle car, and names him XLR (eXtra Large Robot).

It inaugurated the Beast Master series, or Hosteen Storm series after the main character. In German-language translation it was published as Der Letzte der Navajos (:de: Arthur Moewig Verlag, 1963) ‚Äîliterally The Last of the Navajo. Norton wrote one sequel published in 1962 and three by Andre Norton and Lyn McConchie of New Zealand were published forty years later, one of them after Norton's 2005 death. According to McConchie, they were \\"written solely by Lyn from a brief collaborated outline.\\" The first two latterday sequels were named the year's best novel by New Zealand science fiction fans (Sir Julius Vogel Award).\\"Sir Julius Vogel Awards Winners by Category\\" . The Locus Index to SF Awards. Locus Publications.

The team emigrates from Earth to the distant planet Arzor where it is hired to herd livestock. Storm still harbors anger at his former enemies the Xik, and has sworn revenge on a man named Quade for his father's murder. According to Kirkus he finds \\"life and hope\\" instead. In this novel and its sequels Norton explores aspects of Native American culture, specifically the Navajo, through metaphors in Storm's life and in the culture he adopts on his adopted planet. ==Reception== Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the novel four stars out of five \\"for youngsters\\", saying that they \\"are sure to enjoy complete enthrallment.\\" Kirkus Reviews concluded that the \\"fantasy is made convincing by the author's boldness of imagination and by his ability to yield totally to the atmosphere which he creates.\\" This was one of several reviews by Kirkus from 1958 to 1963 that reveal that the reviewer presumed \\"Andre Norton\\" to be a man. Some others were The Time Traders and its three sequels. In Norton's sequel Lord of Thunder (1962), Hosteen Storm discovers and resolves a problem with stakes on a world scale. Kirkus concluded that that story \\"is secondary to the fascinating description, the imaginative ideas, and the general quality of prose and dialogue. For the experienced science-fiction reader.\\" Kirkus welcomed the continuation of the series by Norton and Lyn McConchie in Beast Master's Ark (Tor, 2002), including the promise of a fourth installment. \\"[T]hat's good, since this is one of the better SF series going, with Norton using stripped prose to put her stereotypes through their foredestined rounds. ...

It was loosely based on the 1982 MGM film The Beastmaster, which was itself loosely adapted from the novel The Beast Master by Andre Norton. The series aired 66 episodes over three complete seasons. It was produced by Coote/Hayes Productions. The series was nominated for the Open Craft Award in the category of cinematography by the Australian Film Institute in 2000, and for the Saturn Award for Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films, USA, in 2001. It did not win any of them. ==Premise== Dar (Daniel Goddard) is the last survivor of his tribe. He wanders the lands seeking his lost loved one, Kyra (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), protecting the oppressed and the animals. His friend Tao (Jackson Raine) ‚Äî a fearful, psychology-attracted young man ‚Äî helps him in his quest; Tao is a scholar and a medicine man. Dar meets another orphaned warrior named Arina (Marjean Holden) who joins his quest for her own reasons, but eventually becomes a faithful companion. The world of the Beastmaster is full of lost tribes, genocide appears to be common, and all three of these characters are the survivors or last survivors of lost tribes. The series also featured Monika Schnarre as the Sorceress, apprentice to the Ancient One, played by Grahame Bond, Emilie de Ravin as the Forest Demon named Curupira, and Sam Healy as Iara, the Demon of Water and Serpent. The regular human enemy of Dar, King Zad, was played by Steven Grives. Marc Singer, the Beastmaster from the original film, appears in the third season as Dartanus, the Spirit Warrior who helps Dar on his quest. The general story arc of the series is that the world is changing, civilization is advancing, technology is gaining ground slowly, the old orders of magic and sorcery are fading, and the world is threatened by the supernatural being Balcifer, the Dark One, played by Jeremy Callaghan. Dar is the son of King Eldar, who was destroyed by Balcifer. To defeat Balcifer Dar must locate and reunite his family, who have been turned into animals to hide them from Balcifer, in the Crystal Arc. Balcifer's agent on Earth is King Zad, who is first King of the Terrons, a savage tribe that enslaves and pillages at will. Later, when the tribe is destroyed by King Voden leading a group of Viking-like northerners, Zad re-emerges as the King of Xincha, the city at the center of the world (and Tao's former home). He has deposed Voden, who fled into the wilderness at the end of the second season. There is a contrast there between the crude savage badness of King Zad and the refined, insane evil genius of King Voden. Zad emerges from the contest a more civilized but still savage character. The series was very action-oriented at the beginning, but as the first season wore on, it began to take on a pacifistic and naturalist tone. The opening/ending music and soundtrack of the series were composed by Graeme Coleman. ==Cast== From left to right: Kyra, Dar, The Sorceress, and Tao * Daniel Goddard as Dar * Natalie Jackson Mendoza as Kyra * Jackson Raine as Tao * Monika Schnarre as the Sorceress * Marjean Holden as Arina * Dylan Bierk as The New Sorceress * Grahame Bond as the Ancient One * Steven Grives as King Zad ==EpisodesSyndication== The series is shown on the UK FTA satellite channel Zone Horror (Sky EPG No. 321).

Some have cited the 1971 review of their debut record, Kingdom Come, in Creem magazine as containing the first documented use of the term \\"heavy metal\\" to refer to a style of music; . Sir Lord Baltimore featured a drumming lead singer, traditionally a rarity in rock and metal music. The band is also the first band to be categorized as heavy metal. The group has been called \\"the godfathers of stoner rock.\\" In 2006, Garner and Dambra reunited as Sir Lord Baltimore and released a new album, Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw. The reformed band featured an overt Christian focus and lyrics, an emphasis not found in their earlier work.Freeman, \\"Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master\\", The Village Voice. Justin, no longer an active musician, did not participate.Garner, SirLordBaltimore.com. Garner died on December 5, 2015, of liver failure, ending the band. ==History== Original career Kingdom Come (1970) Having first met in high school, Garner (the band creator), Dambra and Justin started rehearsing together in 1968.Freeman, \\"Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master\\", The Village Voice At the time of their formation, Dambra (as Louis Caine) was also playing for a group called the Koala, who released an eponymous album in 1969.The Koala biography, Bad Cat Records. Justin has cited Cream's Jack Bruce as an influence on his early career choice.Saunders, Kingdom Come review, Creem. After a relatively short time, the new band auditioned for Mike Appel, who was then working as a talent scout (he would later launch and manage the career of Bruce Springsteen). Appel agreed to mentor them and reportedly gave them the name Sir Lord Baltimore, taken from a character in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. For the group's debut album, Appel served as co-producer as well as contributing to arrangements and lyrics. That album, Kingdom Come, was recorded at Vantone Studios and engineered by Nick Masse, with Jim Cretecos serving as Appel's co-producer. Additional tracks, mixing and overdubbing were done at Electric Lady Studios with legendary engineer Eddie Kramer, better known for his work with Jimi Hendrix. According to Appel, Pink Floyd had the opportunity to hear Sir Lord Baltimore during these sessions, and were reportedly impressed.Rivadavia, Sir Lord Baltimore biography, AnthologyRecordings.com. Sir Lord Baltimore (1971) Released on Mercury Records in 1970, Kingdom Come featured very fast-paced hard rock with high levels of distortion in the guitar and, in some cases, the bass, and extensive multi-tracking to further enhance the guitar sound.Cope, Kingdom Come review, HeadHeritage.co.uk. Though this style would become popular in later years, it was considerably different from the majority of that era's contemporary rock music. On February 19‚Äì20, 1971, Sir Lord Baltimore played consecutive nights at New York's Fillmore East as the opening act on a bill that included the J. Geils Band and Black Sabbath, as part of the latter's Paranoid tour. (Sir Lord Baltimore played additional dates on this tour, as well.)\\"Paranoid Tour\\" tour dates, Black-Sabbath.com. A photo of the band used in the Fillmore East's programs was later used as the cover of their 2006 reunion album, Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw. Legacy In May 1971, Mike Saunders (of later Angry Samoans fame) wrote a favorable review of Kingdom Come for Creem. Of historical note was Saunders' assertion that \\"...Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book\\", one of the first printed uses of the term \\"heavy metal\\" to reference a musical genre. Issued in 1971, also on Mercury, Sir Lord Baltimore marked a change in direction, with Kingdom Come's frenetic pace giving way to slower tempos more reminiscent of music produced by the band's hard rock peers. Sir Lord Baltimore expanded to a quartet for this album, with Louis Dambra's brother, Joey Dambra, joining as a second guitarist. Sir Lord Baltimore contains a supposed live recording, \\"Where Are We Going\\", which was actually recorded at Mercury Studios. The audience was dubbed in as the producer thought it was a good idea to include a \\"live\\" track.Information from John Garner 2006 Their career started to fade after Sir Lord Baltimore's release, and Mercury dropped them shortly thereafter. The band publicly blamed drugs on its initial downfall, with low record sales and non-payment of royalties also being cited.Rivadavia, Sir Lord Baltimore biography, AnthologyRecordings.com. * Freeman, \\"Godsmacked: Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master\\", The Village Voice. However, the band did start work in the mid-1970s on an unreleased third album, originally scheduled for 1976, and music written for that project was eventually used on Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw. In 1994, Kingdom Come and Sir Lord Baltimore were reissued on a single compact disc, Kingdom Come/Sir Lord Baltimore, by PolyGram, However, the track listing on the combined CD differed from the original recordings. Kingdom Come was issued again separately on digital in 2007, this time on Anthology Recordings. Reunion Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw (2006) Some 30 years after the band's breakup, Garner and Dambra reunited to record and self-distribute a new Sir Lord Baltimore album, Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw. Garner produced the album, issued on JG Records in July 2006 and available only via mail order. The majority of the album's bass guitar work was performed by Tony Franklin, with guitarist Anthony Guido and bass player Sam Powell being credited as guest musicians. Although the album's music was originally written for the aborted 1976 release, the lyrics were modified to present more overt Christian viewpoint.Seventies heavy-metal pioneers Sir Lord Baltimore have returned with a new sound and a new master\\", The Village Voice. * Rockwell, Sir Lord Baltimore III Raw review, AngelicWarlord.com. In 2007, Garner and Swedish guitar player Janne Stark (formerly of Overdrive and Locomotive Breath) recorded a new version of \\"Woman Tamer\\" from SLB's second album. In March 2008, it was announced that Garner and Stark, with a selected bass player, would make an appearance at Sweden Rock Festival in June 2008, but lack of pay and other mitigating circumstances prevented them from performing. Dambra is an active pastor who ministers to homeless families in Los Angeles, California. Garner (born John Guarneri on February 2, 1952 in Brooklyn, New York) died of liver failure on December 5, 2015 at the age of 63; effectively ending the band. ==Members== *John Garner - lead vocals, drums (1968‚Äì1976, 2006‚Äì2015; died 2015) *Louis Dambra - guitar (1968‚Äì1976, 2006‚Äì2007; died 2019) *Gary Justin - bass (1968‚Äì1976) *Joey Dambra - guitar (1970‚Äì1972) ==Discography== Studio albums {  - !

It was a victory for the Scots led by the Guardian, Sir Andrew Murray over an Anglo-Scots force commanded by David III Strathbogie, titular Earl of Atholl, and a leading supporter of Edward Balliol. ==Background== After the murder of John Comyn, the nephew of the former King John Balliol, by Robert Bruce and his supporters in 1306, the Scottish War of Independence was at one and the same time a civil war, with the Balliol and Comyn parties taking the side of the English. In the winter of 1314 the Scottish Parliament, the first to meet after King Robert's great victory at the Battle of Bannockburn, pronounced formal sentence of forfeiture against all those who held land in Scotland but continued to fight on the side of the English. Thus was created a class of nobility known as the 'disinherited', old Balliol loyalists who would not be reconciled with the Bruce party. The 1328 Treaty of Northampton between England and Scotland, based on a full recognition of Robert Bruce's kingship, ended any immediate prospect these men had of gaining their lost inheritance. However, the death of Bruce in 1329, and the accession to the throne of David II, his infant son, offered them a second chance. Under the determined and effective leadership of Henry de Beaumont, one of their number and a veteran of the Scottish wars, a party began to take shape in the early 1330s, focusing their hopes on Edward Balliol, son of the former King John, as the rightful King of Scotland. In 1332 Beaumont and Balliol launched a seaborne invasion of Scotland, winning a remarkable victory at the Battle of Dupplin Moor; but with only limited support in the country they were expelled by the end of the year. Edward III, the young English king, who had been playing something of a double game, then decided to declare his open support for Balliol, and the Scots were defeated once again in the summer of 1333 at the Battle of Halidon Hill. Edward Balliol was reseated on his contentious throne, but his residence proved no more certain than before. In 1335 Edward III made his what was to be his greatest effort on Balliol's behalf, coming to Scotland with a large army. Unable to force the issue in open battle, he left the disinherited to manage as best they could. ==A New Guardian== Although the flame of Scottish resistance burned low at times, it was never completely extinguished. David II was sent to the safety of France in 1334. In September 1335 Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell, whose father, also named Andrew, was joint-commander with William Wallace of the victorious Scottish army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, was appointed Guardian of Scotland by the rump of Bruce loyalists meeting in Dumbarton Castle. Within a short period he was to become one of the country's greatest leaders, and a skilled student of the kind of guerilla warfare practised by King Robert in days past. Murray's credentials were perfect: he was consistent in his defence of the national cause, never at any time submitting to Edward III or Balliol, unlike Robert Stewart, nephew and heir of the infant David. The men who gathered round him at Dumbarton formed the nucleus of the national revival-the earls of March and Ross, Sir William Douglas, Maurice Murray and William Keith. After the departure of the English king from Scotland - followed soon after by Edward Balliol - Murray's chief opponent was David de Strathbogie, the titular earl of Atholl, and Balliol's chief lieutenant in the north. ==St. Andrew's Day, 1335== In the late autumn of 1335 Strathbogie was operating north of the Forth, attempting, so the sources allege, to eradicate all freeholders, who from the time of William Wallace had been the backbone of Scottish resistance. Strathbogie's actions mirrored the policy of King Edward in southern Scotland, where over one hundred freeholders were forfeited in the period from 1335 to 1337. John of Fordun, a Scottish chronicler, reports the situation thus; But the great tyranny and cruelty this earl practised among the people words cannot bring within the mind's grasp; some he disinherited, others he murdered: and in the end, he cast in his mind how he might wipe out the freeholders from the face of the earth. Strathbogie crowned his campaign by laying siege to Kildrummy Castle in Strathdon in Aberdeenshire. Kildrummy had for some time been held for King David by his aunt, the Lady Christina Bruce, who also happened to be Murray's wife. From southern Scotland the Guardian rushed north to her aid, having gathered a modest force of some 800 men. Strathbogie, according to the historian Lord Hailes, had 3000 men at his disposal. Murray's tactics were risky: he was marching into battle, which all Scots leaders had carefully avoided since the disaster at Halidon Hill. But the situation was critical: the fall of Kildrummy would have been a serious setback to the national cause in the north. Strathbogie was warned of Murray's approach. He raised the siege of Kildrummy, moving south to intercept his enemy in the forest of Culblean. Murray was joined a few miles north of the River Dee, to the east of Strathbogie's position near Culblean Hill, by a party of three hundred men from Kildrummy, led by one John of the Craig. John's knowledge of the local countryside was invaluable. On the night of 29/30 November he guided Murray's force on a wide sweeping movement to the south and west, designed to take Strathbogie from the rear. As Murray approached at dawn on St. Andrew's Day the element of surprise was lost when he was spotted by enemy scouts. The camp was warned and Strathbogie made ready. But his troops were largely recruited from the local area, probably by impressment, and he appears to have had no archers. Murrays force was divided in two, the forward unit being commanded by William Douglas. When he saw Strathbogie arrayed for battle Douglas halted, as if hesitating in the face of the enemy's preparedness. This had the desired effect and Strathbogie led his men in a downhill charge; but their ranks began to break on reaching a burn, and Douglas ordered a counter-charge. Sir Andrew with the rearguard immediately launched an assault on the enemy's exposed flank. The charge was so fierce that the bushes in the way were all flattened down. Pinned down in front and attacked from the side, Strathbogie's army broke. Unable to escape, and refusing to surrender, Strathbogie stood with his back to an oak tree and was killed in a last stand with a small group of followers, including Walter and Thomas Comyn. Some of the survivors took refuge in the nearby island castle of Loch Kinord, but were forced to surrender the following day. ==Culblean in history== Culblean memorial stone Compared with the other great battles of the Wars of Independence, Culblean was a relatively small affair, and is now largely forgotten. Nevertheless, its size was greatly outweighed by its importance on the road to Scottish national recovery. W. Douglas Simpson passed what might be said to be the final verdict on the battle when he wrote; Culblean was the turning point in the second war of Scottish Independence, and therefore an event of great national importance. Small as it was it effectively nullified the effects of Edward's summer invasion, ending forever Balliol's hope of gaining the Scottish throne. Its effects were almost immediately felt. Edward Balliol spent the winter of 1335-6, so says the Lanercost Chronicle; ...with his people at Elande, in England, because he does not yet possess in Scotland any castle or town where he could dwell in safety. ==References== Primary * Anonimalle Chronicle, 1333‚Äì81, ed V.

Ritual song of defiance: a social history of students at the University of Otago (1990) () (\\"The Otago University Debating Society proved to be one of the most energetic student organizations over the next forty years.\\") the first university to be founded in New Zealand. Echoing trends in Australia and the United States (the University of Sydney Union was founded in 1874 and Harvard's debating union in 1880), in the latter decades of the nineteenth century debating was seen as an important talent for New Zealand's thought leaders, * * and was one of the three sports in the New Zealand University Games from 1902. Prominent members of OUDS during its early years included Alfred Richard Barclay (one of its first vice-presidents), William Downie Stewart Jr (1898‚Äì1900), Harry Bedford (1900‚Äì1901) who as a 25-year-old policial novice entered Parliament in 1902 with the highest individual vote that had ever been recorded in New Zealand, John Callan (who won the Joynt Challenge Scroll in 1905) and Ossie Mazengarb (c.1910). OUDS is one of the five societies in the New Zealand Universities Debating Council, through which members compete in domestic, national and international tournaments. In conjunction with members from the Otago University Rugby Club, OUDS members formed the Otago University Students' Association (OUSA) in 1890 because it felt that university students needed strong representation. OUSA has since become a strong advocate for student rights. ==Governance== OUDS Executive OUDS has an eight-person executive composed of the President, Vice President, Secretary-Treasurer, Senior Development Officer, Novice Development Officer, Schools Officer, Externals Officer, and Equity Officer. An additional Women's portfolio also exists, which is delegated to a female- identifying member of the executive. The current president of the society is: Joseph Garry (2020-) Past presidents include: Connor Seddon (2018-2019), Joe Ascroft (2017), Alice Sowry (2016), Katarina Schwarz (2015), John Brinsley- Pirie (2014), Paul Hunt (2012‚Äì13), Louis Chambers (2010‚Äì11) and William Chisholm (2009).  Sponsorship  OUDS is financially supported by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Otago, the Faculty of Law at the University of Otago, and Anderson Lloyd. == Tournaments ==  Glossary of Debating Terms  * CA/DCA- The chief adjudicator/deputy chief adjudicators are judges selected to run the debating side of a tournament, and are responsible for selecting motions, setting a timetable, and running the tournament. * Convenors- Individuals in charge of running the administrative side of a tournament, such as booking rooms and organising social events. * Team names- Team names are based on a team's institution, and ranking within that institution. For example, the best Otago team is referred to as O1, the best Victoria team as V1, and so on and so forth. * Majors- Majors are the main tournaments which OUDS participates in. There are four major tournaments for OUDS: Joynt Scroll, Australs, Officers Cup and Worlds. * Breaking- When a team or judge is selected to participate in the out-rounds of a tournament (eg. Semi-finals, Finals). * Supers- Supers, or Super-adjudicators are judges who have CAed or DCAed a tournament. They are traditionally expected to be of a high quality as judges, are exempt from campus conflicts, and are responsible for accrediting new judges. * Accreditation- A process where new judges 'trainee', and watch debates alongside a more experienced judge until they are thought to be of a high-enough quality to accredit (or qualify) as a judge. Which trainees accredit is decided by whichever super-adjudicators are attending a tournament. Trainees are able to accredit at any one of four tournaments; Joynt Scroll, Claytons, Officers Cup or Thropy. Only accredited judges are able to judge New Zealand's two major tournaments; Officers Cup and Joynt Scroll.  Bluff Cup  The Bluff Cup is the weekly internal tournament held between teams of debaters at OUDS. Each team name is based on a South Island locality. The Bluff Cup itself was donated in 1988 by the team that won the OUDS championship in that year, Team Bluff. At the end of Otago's first semester, a final is held. Recent winners include: * 2016: Nathaniel Brown, Grace Belworthy and Emily Williams * 2017: Adam Sangster and Jeanne- Marie Bonnet * 2018: Andre Castaing and William Warren * 2019: Anna Roberts, Shannon Chalmers, Seth Whittington A more complete list can be found on the OUDS website.  Joynt Scroll  Joynt Scroll (Formerly known as New Zealand University Prepared Debating Championships or \\"Winters\\") is a three team member debating competition. Joynt Scroll is New Zealand's oldest and most respected national university debating tournament, and is New Zealand's second oldest sporting competition. Until recently, it was a fully prepared tournament held during the second semester break, but in 2019, the tournament was changed to have only thirty minutes of preparation time, and was moved to the first semester break (Easter time). Otago has consistently performed well at Joynt scroll * In 2011, O1 (Kieran Bunn, William Cheyne and Paul Hunt) made it to the semi-finals of the competition, only to be defeated by the eventual winners, Victoria Two. William Cheyne was named as Captain of the NZ Prepared Debating team (an honorary team made up of the best speakers of the tournament) that year. * In 2012 O1 (Nicholas Gavey, Kieran Bunn, Paul Hunt) finished as runners up.\\"Victoria Wins Joynt Scroll Debating\\" University Sport website. * In 2013, O1 (Patrick Dawson, Kieran Bunn and John Brinsley-Pirie) once more reached the semifinals ,http://www.odt.co.nz/campus/university- otago/273816/further-successes-debating-society with speaker Kieran Bunn named as best speaker of the tournament and John Brinsley-Pirie named as 1st reserve to the New Zealand Team. * In 2015, O1 (Alice Sowry, John Brinsley-Pirie and Jamie Tocher) once again made the final. * In 2016, O1 (Paul Hunt, Joe Ascroft and Jamie Tocher) again made the final and lost to the University of Auckland. Joe Ascroft was chosen as second reserve and Jamie Tocher chosen as first reserve for the championship team. * In 2017, OUDS judge Courtney Cunningham was a DCA for Joynt Scroll, and OUDS judge Emily Williams broke as a judge. * In 2018, OUDS judges Joe Ascroft and Emily Williams were DCAs, and OUDS alumna Alice Sowry was the CA. * In 2019, Otago hosted Joynt Scroll. The tournament was convened by Joe Garry and Selena Ballantyne, and the CA was OUDS alumni Joe Ascroft. O1 (Connor Seddon, Nick Robertson and Grace Belworthy) won the tournament, and OUDS judge Simon Williams broke as a judge.  Claytons  Claytons is an amateur tournament for debaters who have not spoken at more than two major tournaments. It is held annually between OUDS and the University of Canterbury Debating Society and has sometimes included teams from Waikato University (as in 2011). Traditionally Otago and Canterbury alternate as hosts of the event with adjudicators from other University debating societies, such as Victoria, travelling to adjudicate debates at Claytons for the purpose of accrediting trainee adjudicators. Teams of three speakers are given 30 minutes preparation time before each debate. A round of debates is held in a pool format and teams with the best records in terms of wins and speaker points from those debates advance to the semi-finals and finals of the tournament. The 2006 competition, hosted by OUDS was in Waimate, South Canterbury and was won by a team from Canterbury. The 2007 tournament, held in Christchurch, was won by Otago. In more recent history Otago won the 2011 and 2012 tournaments also held in Waimate. Both of these were Otago-Otago finals. In 2013 Canterbury won the Claytons final in a 5‚Äì4 split decision which gave rise to the Goodall paradox. From 2014 onwards, Claytons has been held at the Raincliff Anglican Youth Camp. From 2014-2017, Otago-Otago finals occurred. In 2018 and 2019, Otago-Canterbury finals occurred, and the tournament was won by Canterbury both years. As a tournament Claytons is noted for its unique social nature compared to other debating tournaments held in New Zealand. Participating debaters socialise in the same common area and sleep in the same living quarters over the entire tournament. At other tournaments, teams from different societies are often housed in different hotel rooms and do not have a focal social commons. Claytons is also unique in that it takes place at a scout camp. Debates are held in sleeping rooms, the main room and outside. An equivalent tournament, Thropy, is held in the North Island between Victoria, Auckland and Waikato Debating Societies.  Australasian Intervarsity Debating Championships  The Australasian Intervarsity Debating Championships more commonly known as \\"Australs\\" is a week-long competition held in the break between university semesters. Debates are held over a range of international topics. Australs follows a traditional debating format: three team members with eight preliminary rounds. Topics are impromptu with half an hour of preparation time allowed. The 2010 Australs was hosted by the University of Auckland Debating Society. OUDS sent seven teams and six adjudicators. William Chisholm was a grand final adjudicator. In 2011 Australs was held in South Korea. Otago sent two teams and three adjudicators. The Otago One team (Purdon, Bunn, Hunt) broke in 15th place to the double-octo finals. In 2012 Otago sent five teams and four adjudicators to Australs hosted by Victoria University of Wellington. In 2013 the Otago University Debating Society was successful in a bid to host the 2014 Australs.http://www.odt.co.nz/campus/university-otago/269460/university-host- big-debating-event In 2017, OUDS broke to the Octo-finals of Australs with a team of Joe Ascroft, Emily Williams and Grace Belworthy.  Officers Cup  Easters, (previously known as the \\"University Games\\") is the first national debating tournament of the year, competing for the Officer's Cup. OUDS has been a regular competitor at the tournament (usually sending the maximum of five teams) ever since the first event in 1902. The tournament is held in the first mid-semester break. Teams of two speakers are given five minutes' preparation time. University Games (Easters) 2010 was held in Invercargill.2010 Uni Games, The Southland Times, 14 April 2010 (\\"The 2010 Uni Games, held in Invercargill from April 14 to 16\\"; also slide 18 shows Otago debate team member Kurt Purdon)Victoria beats Otago in debating contest, The Southland Times, 16 April 2010 In 2018, Otago defeated Victoria University in the final with a team of Joe Ascroft and Emily Williams, this was the first time Otago had won the tournament in 20 years. Otago is due to host Easters in 2019. World Universities Debating Championship OUDS has sent teams to the World Universities Debating Championship. In 2013 Otago sent three teams, all of whom 'broke' or qualified, for the 48 team knock out rounds. The Otago A team of Alec Dawson and Kieran Bunn made it into the top four teams and competed in the grand final (ultimately won by the Monash B team). In the 2014 Worlds in Chennai, Otago sent two teams, once again breaking both teams into the knock out rounds. Unfortunately both teams were knocked out in the octo- finals. Otago University has traditionally been very supportive of the OUDS WUDC campaigns.\\"Otago Law Students Impressive at World Universities Debating Societies Championship\\" ‚Äì Otago Faculty of Law http://www.otago.ac.nz/law/news/otago040805.html\\"Otago debaters in world top four\\" ‚Äì Otago Daily Times 5 Jan 2013 http://www.odt.co.nz/campus/university- otago/241473/otago-debaters-world-top-four  Australasian Wom*ns Debating Championships  OUDS has regularly sent teams to Australasian Wom*ns. Some of the best women debaters from around the world compete in the tournament, which is aimed at development for junior speakers. In 2016, Otago made it to the grand final with a team of Emily Williams and Alice Sowery. Similarly, in 2017 Otago broke to the semi-finals of the tournament with a team of Emily Williams and Selena Ballantyne. In 2017, Otago won a bid to host AWDC in 2018. Otago AWDC 2018 occurred in early September 2018. Teams from around Australasia attended the tournament. Two Otago teams broke into the quarter finals. Otago 1 made it to the Grand Finals. Grace Belworthy was awarded fifth best speaker of the tournament.  New Zealand Wom*ns Debating Championships  In 2018, Otago sent a team to the first NZ Wom*ns Debating Championships. == OUDS alumni == 1988 OUDS membersThere are a number of notable alumni members. * Michael Laws writer, broadcaster and politician *Malcolm Wright Professor of Marketing, Massey University NZ * Chris Carter, politician and gay equality campaigner * David Pine singer and diplomat * Deborah Russell MP, PhD and MP for Mt Albert * David Cunliffe, former leader of the Labour Party * Grant Robertson Minister of Finance * Holly Walker, politician and author * Thomas Jeffery Parker zoologist Rhodes Scholars OUDS alumni include a number of Otago University's Rhodes Scholars who have also held executive positions in the society.

These include debates about mining and deep-sea oil drilling in New Zealand and alcohol age legislation. OUDS has been featured regularly in the Otago University student magazine, Critic (magazine), since the magazines inception in 1925. From 2010‚Äì2011 Critic had a regular feature column called \\"Debatable\\" where two writers would argue the affirming or negative case on a moot. ==ReferencesExternal links== * OUDS website Otago, University of Category:University of Otago Category:Student debating societies Category:1878 establishments in New Zealand Category:Student organizations established in 1878 ","title":"Otago University Debating Society"},{"id":"5568865","text":"Pahia is a small rural locality in coastal Southland, New Zealand, not to be confused with the North Island tourist resort of Paihia. Surrounding areas include Ruahine, Wakapatu, Round Hill, Colac Bay and Orepuki. The main road, Orepuki-Riverton Hwy (section of ), runs through it. Pahia is 15 minutes from Riverton, 20 minutes from Tuatapere and 45 minutes from Invercargill.A uniquely shaped hill visible from Bluff Hill to Sandhill Point ==History== During the early years of European contact with New Zealand, Pahia was home to a substantial MƒÅori village and island pƒÅ (fortified stronghold) near Cosy Nook (known locally as the \\"Old PƒÅ\\"). The village served as an important contact point for European sealers and traders requiring potatoes and flax for the Australian market in the 1820s. The naming is uncertain. One theory is that the name 'Pahia' comes from the village Chief of the time, Tahu Pahia. The other theory is that it is a literal translation for 'slapped', referring to the hill resembling meals of mashed or pounded food. It used to have rail running through, a cheese factory, forest industry and a small gold mining industry. It also once used to have a primary school named Pahia School, which closed its doors in 1997. Pahia is part of a historic trail with signage informing you of its history. The area today is made up of many farms, including sheep, dairy and deer. Geographically Pahia lies between the thick, forest-covered Longwood Range and the Tasman Sea. There are outlooks in places over Te Waewae Bay and the Princess Mountains, and also Stewart Island/Rakiura. Pahia Hill, and across to Ruahine the Ruahine Hills and Mt Victoria make up some of the geographic landmarks. The weather on average is cooler than Central Otago but it is rare to have snow settle on the ground in Winter.

It was produced by Desilu Studios. ==Plot synopsis== The program features the exploits of Chuck Martin (Kenneth Tobey) and Pete \\"P. T.\\" Moore (Craig Hill), owners of a fictitious helicopter chartering company, Whirlybirds, Inc., in the American West. Martin and Moore sell their services to various clients at the fictional airport Longwood Field. The Whirlybirds series was, like I Love Lucy, a product of Desilu Studios. One particular episode of I Love Lucy, Number 140, became pivotal to the Bell 47's public image as the definitive light helicopter of the 1950s. In No. 140, titled \\"Bon Voyage\\" and first aired on CBS on January 16, 1956, Lucy Ricardo misses the sailing of her trans- Atlantic ocean liner and commandeers a friendly pilot of a Bell 47G to fly her to the ship; Jack Albertson guest stars in this episode. Down she goes on the hoist, in a studio sequence carefully staged using a 47G cabin mockup. Desilu Studios, intrigued by the Bell 47 and its manufacturer, began discussions with Bell Aircraft about how the entertainment potential of the Bell 47 might be further developed for a television audience. The result of this collaboration became The Whirlybirds. Tobey and Hill did not fly the helicopters on the show. That task was handled by expert helicopter pilots Ed Fuderich, Bob Gilbreath, and Harry Hauss of National Helicopter Service, Inc. After production of the series ended, Kenneth Tobey reprised his role as Chuck Martin in episode #223 of the long-running television series, Lassie. Titled \\"The Rescue\\", the Lassie episode was broadcast on October 2, 1960. Chuck Martin uses a Bell 47G to rescue a trapped Timmy Martin (Jon Provost). ==Production notes== The series was originally supposed to air on CBS, but was instead put into syndication by CBS Films. Series filming started in 1956. The first four episodes were titled The Whirlybirds and the rest simply Whirlybirds. Many episodes were directed by Harve Foster and Robert Altman. The creators were Art Napoleon and Jo Napoleon. Assistant Directors Bruce Bilson and Sid Sidman handle 2nd unit filming. The series was filmed on location in California. The production first used the Santa Susanna Airport in Simi Valley. The airport, no longer in existence, was near the Iverson Movie Ranch, a dude ranch used to film westerns. Later episodes were filmed at the San Fernando Airport, which is also now closed. Much of the open area seen around both airports in the series has since been developed. Helicopters used The two helicopter types used were Bell models, a 47G and a 47J Ranger; the tail numbers were N975B and N2838B (and N1538B as back-up), respectively. In reality, many helicopters played the role of N975B. Other Bell 47Gs owned by National Helicopter Service were used in the filming with \\"N975B\\" decals covering their actual registrations. ==Guest stars== *Charles Aidman *Jeanne Bates *Edward Binns *Whit Bissell *Edgar Buchanan *Johnny Crawford *Mike Connors *Walter Coy *Francis De Sales *Ann Doran *Donna Douglas *Frank Ferguson *Bruce Gordon *Dabbs Greer *Ron Hagerthy *Stacy Harris *Darryl Hickman *Connie Hines *June Kenney *Brett King *Gail Kobe *Robert Vaughn, *Ethel Waters *Tyler McVey *Joyce Meadows *John M.

The U.S. National Archives possesses a complete set of original 16 mm prints. The original 35mm film prints of the series are no longer available; unfortunately, extant video copies are inferior with poor contrast/low-resolution images, some emulsion scratches, and with 16mm projector film-gate dirt visible in the frame corners. Considering the many generations of dubs made of this series, the soundtracks of most episodes remain in relative high fidelity. ==Syndication== After production of Whirlybirds ended, CBS returned 39 of the 111 episodes to syndication and retitled the series, Copter Patrol. ==International airings== In the United Kingdom, it was shown by the BBC in the late 1950s and early 1960s and repeated in the 1970s and 1980s. In Italy, RAI dubbed many episodes in the early 1960s with the title Avventure in elicottero.

A pitcher, Owens played in Major League Baseball for the New York Mets in 2006 and the Florida Marlins in 2007. He bats and throws right-handed. ==Amateur career== Owens graduated from G. Holmes Braddock High School in Miami and attended Barry University. He played catcher as an amateur. He planned to attend medical school but scouts noticed his exceptional throwing skills and encouraged him to take up pitching. ==Professional career== Owens was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an undrafted free agent in June . In , an elbow injury hampered his performance. As a result, the Pirates left him unprotected and he was selected by the New York Mets in the minor league phase of the Rule 5 Draft. In , after four years in the Single-A leagues, Owens was promoted to the Double-A Binghamton Mets where he was outstanding as a closer. He compiled 51 strikeouts while allowing only eight hits in 25 innings pitched before his promotion to the major leagues. He made his major league debut on July 7, , for the New York Mets. He pitched a perfect ninth inning in a 7-3 Mets loss to the Florida Marlins. On November 20, 2006, the Mets traded Owens, along with Matt Lindstrom to the Florida Marlins for lefties Jason Vargas and Adam Bostick. ==2007 season== Owens started the season as a late-inning reliever, but was looked at as a closing option during spring training. Owens made it clear that he coveted the closer job very early on. After newly acquired reliever Jorge Julio proved to be ineffective as the club's closer, Owens became a candidate for the closer role. On May 11, Owens was placed on the disabled list with right shoulder rotator cuff tendinitis. Later in the season, Owens was shut down, and ultimately underwent shoulder surgery. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Winter Wonders by Chris Kline, Baseball America, January 5, 2005 Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:New York Mets players Category:Florida Marlins players Category:Gulf Coast Pirates players Category:Williamsport Crosscutters players Category:Hickory Crawdads players Category:Lynchburg Hillcats players Category:St. Lucie Mets players Category:Jupiter Hammerheads players Category:Sportspeople from Miami Category:Barry Buccaneers baseball players Category:Baseball players suspended for drug offenses Category:American sportspeople in doping cases Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:Binghamton Mets players ","title":"Henry Owens (right-handed pitcher)"},{"id":"5569051","text":"A listing of the characters from the ALF television series that ran between 1986 and 1990. ==ALFMain characters== *William Francis \\"Willie\\" Tanner (played by Max Wright) is the father figure, and a social worker by trade. *Katherine Daphne \\"Kate\\" Halligan Tanner (played by Anne Schedeen) is the mother figure and has at least one sister. *Lynn \\"Lynnie\\" Tanner (played by Andrea Elson) is the eldest child of the Tanner family and their only daughter. *Brian \\"Bri\\" Tanner (played by Benji Gregory) is the elder son and middle child of the Tanner family. ==Recurring characters== The Tanner family *Neal Tanner (played by Jim J.

For FOH, the signal is reconstructed as a piecewise linear approximation to the original signal that was sampled. A mathematical model such as FOH (or, more commonly, the zero-order hold) is necessary because, in the sampling and reconstruction theorem, a sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), representing the discrete samples, x(nT), is low-pass filtered to recover the original signal that was sampled, x(t). However, outputting a sequence of Dirac impulses is impractical. Devices can be implemented, using a conventional DAC and some linear analog circuitry, to reconstruct the piecewise linear output for either predictive or delayed FOH. Even though this is not what is physically done, an identical output can be generated by applying the hypothetical sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), to a linear time-invariant system, otherwise known as a linear filter with such characteristics (which, for an LTI system, are fully described by the impulse response) so that each input impulse results in the correct piecewise linear function in the output. ==Basic first-order hold== Ideally sampled signal xs(t). First-order hold is the hypothetical filter or LTI system that converts the ideally sampled signal :{ - x_s(t)\\\\, = x(t) \\\\ T \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\delta(t - nT) \\\\ -  = T \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(nT) \\\\delta(t - nT) \\\\ } Piecewise linear signal xFOH(t). to the piecewise linear signal :x_{\\\\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\\\\,= \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(nT) \\\\mathrm{tri} \\\\left(\\\\frac{t - nT}{T} \\\\right) \\\\ Impulse response (non-causal) of first-order hold hFOH(t). resulting in an effective impulse response of : h_{\\\\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\\\\,= \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\mathrm{tri} \\\\left(\\\\frac{t}{T} \\\\right) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{t}{T} \\\\right) & \\\\mbox{if } t < T \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\ : where \\\\mathrm{tri}(x) \\\\ is the triangular function.

Delayed first-order hold, sometimes called causal first-order hold, is identical to FOH above except that its output is delayed by one sample period resulting in a delayed piecewise linear output signal :x_{\\\\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\\\\,= \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(nT) \\\\mathrm{tri} \\\\left(\\\\frac{t - T - nT}{T} \\\\right) \\\\ Impulse response of causal first-order hold hFOH(t). resulting in an effective impulse response of : h_{\\\\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\\\\,= \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\mathrm{tri} \\\\left(\\\\frac{t-T}{T} \\\\right) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{t-T}{T} \\\\right) & \\\\mbox{if } t-T < T \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\ : where \\\\mathrm{tri}(x) \\\\ is the triangular function.

The impulse response of the delayed FOH does not respond before the input impulse. This kind of delayed piecewise linear reconstruction is physically realizable by implementing a digital filter of gain H(z) = 1 ‚àí z‚àí1, applying the output of that digital filter (which is simply x[n]‚àíx[n‚àí1]) to an ideal conventional digital-to-analog converter (that has an inherent zero-order hold as its model) and integrating (in continuous-time, H(s) = 1/(sT)) the DAC output. ==Predictive first-order hold== Predictive FOH output signal xFOH(t). Lastly, the predictive first-order hold is quite different. This is a causal hypothetical LTI system or filter that converts the ideally sampled signal :{ - x_s(t)\\\\, = x(t) \\\\ T \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\delta(t - nT) \\\\ -  = T \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(nT) \\\\delta(t - nT) \\\\ } into a piecewise linear output such that the current sample and immediately previous sample are used to linearly extrapolate up to the next sampling instance.

She is a professor at the University of S√£o Paulo, currently being its Research dean. ==Biography== Professor Zatz's accomplishments have been recognized and she has received many awards and prizes, including the 2000 L'Or√©al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science and the 2001 Claudia Woman of the Year Award, by Claudia Magazine. Born in Israel in 1947, she moved to France with her family and lived there until the age of seven years. Her father, Lony Eden (1912-1984) was from Dorohoi, Romania and her mother Ella Kott Eden (b.1914) was from Warsaw. In 1939, her parents fled the Germans and arrived in Israel where Mayana and her sister were born. Mayana arrived in Brazil with her family in 1955. Mayana obtained a BA in Biology at University of S√£o Paulo in 1968, a M.Sc. and a D.Sc. in Biological Sciences from University of S√£o Paulo in 1970 and 1974, respectively, her post-doctorate in Medical Genetics at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), in 1977, and her livre- doc√™ncia from University of S√£o Paulo, in 1987. Mayana became interested in the study of muscular dystrophies when she was at college and followed a patient from a family with a high incidence of the condition, and who wanted to start a family. In 1969, Dr Zatz started her work in genetic counseling in families which were carriers of neuromuscular diseases, in order to evaluate as well as to inform the risk of having offspring with a similar problem. Twelve years later she contacted these same families again, and found that most of the high risk families had avoided having children. On the other hand, Mayana was shocked to see the way the sick children born during that period had been abandoned. These children, who generally had a normal mental development but whose muscular problems were not treated, neither went to school nor underwent physical therapy. Therefore, in 1981, Mayana and her team founded the Brazilian Association of Muscular Dystrophy (ABIM) at the Institute of Bioscience of the USP. Seven years later she obtained the physical location for the organization's headquarters. ABIM, which was the first center for assistance of dystrophy carriers in Latin America, weekly treats ca. 100 children and adolescents divided into daily groups of twenty patients, besides eventual visits adding up to approximately 300 people per month. Since its foundation the organization has assisted over 1,000 (mostly poor) children. They are first screened and upon confirmation of the illness are sent to the association for lifetime treatment. ABIM offers physical therapy, hydrotherapy, recreational activities, activities which stimulate creativity and reasoning, besides psychological group and individual support for the carriers and their relatives. Currently Mayana is a member of the International Human Genome Project of the Academy of Sciences of the State of S√£o Paulo, and of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. According to the Institute for Scientific Information, her work has been cited 1,500 times in 102 publications between 1977 and 1997. She has had 173 papers and approximately 150 articles published in foreign magazines such as \\"Nature Genetics\\" and \\"Human Molecular Genetics\\". Mayana is also columnist of Brazilian Veja MagazineVEJA.com: Gen√©tica  Mayana Zatz (Portuguese) and a recipient of the 2003 TWAS Prize. Since the beginning of her career Mayana has assisted approximately 16,000 people of families affected by genetic diseases (mostly neuromuscular problems), which is the highest number of cases registered in the world. In the latter part of 1995, Mayana, professor Maria Rita Passos Bueno, and doctorate student Elo√≠sa de S√° Moreira were the first scientists in the world to find one of the genes related to a dystrophy which affects the arms and legs. They also mapped the gene responsible for the Knobloch syndrome, which causes a type of progressive blindness. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Curriculum Vitae.

It was a product of the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy. In May 1995, the South Australian media carried reports that the 'secret women's business' had been fabricated. Five Ngarrindjeri women reportedly said that they did not believe in or had never heard of the 'secret women's business' until it had been raised by Doreen Kartinyeri. In June 1995 there were further allegations that two prominent members of the Ngarrindjeri community ‚Äì Doug and Sarah Milera ‚Äì had confirmed the allegations of fabrication. In response, the South Australian Government established a Royal Commission on 16 June 1995. A former South Australian District Court judge, Mrs Iris Stevens, was appointed as Royal Commissioner. In brief, the Royal Commissioner was appointed to inquire into and report on whether any aspect of the 'women's business' was a fabrication and, if so, how the fabrication occurred, its extent and purpose. Controversy plagued the work of the Royal Commission. The 'proponent women' refused to give evidence to the Commission; 'dissident' Ngarrindjeri women claimed threats and intimidation; Ngarrindjeri elder, Doug Milera reportedly withdrew his allegations that the 'secret women's business' had been fabricated; amateur historian, Betty Fisher, told the Commission she had first been told of the 'secret women's business' in 1960; and anthropologists from the South Australian Museum disputed the existence of the 'secret women's business'. The Royal Commission's report was published in December 1995. Its major findings were: *the '... 'women's business' emerged in response to a need of the anti-bridge lobby to provide something of sufficient cultural significance to warrant the making of a declaration by the Federal Minister'; *the 'women's business' was unknown to the twelve dissident Ngarrindjeri women who gave evidence before the Commission and who were described by the Royal Commissioner as 'credible witnesses'; *looking at 'the whole of the evidence, including the history of events, the anthropological evidence and the evidence of the dissident women, ... the whole claim of the \\"women's business\\" from its inception was a fabrication; *the purpose of the fabrication was to obtain a declaration prohibiting the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. ==After the Royal Commission== The Howard Government passed the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act (1997), which allowed construction to go ahead; and in August 2001, in a civil case in the Federal Court of Australia, Justice John von Doussa rejected claims for damages by the developers, stating that he was not satisfied that the claims of \\"secret women's business\\" had been fabricated.. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Royal Commission, (June 1996), The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Royal Commission : Transcript of proceedings, Government of South Australia Category:Australian Aboriginal culture Category:History of South Australia Category:Indigenous Australian politics Category:Religion in Australia Category:South Australian royal commissions Category:Ngarrindjeri Category:Politics of South Australia ","title":"Hindmarsh Island Royal Commission"},{"id":"5569156","text":"Peter Kirk (February 15, 1840 - May 4, 1916) was a British-born American businessman who founded the City of Kirkland in King County, Washington, United States.

All municipal elections in the province of Ontario are held on the same date; see 2006 Ontario municipal elections for elections in other cities. The election chose the mayor and city councillors who will sit on Greater Sudbury City Council. As with other Ontario municipal elections, the 2006 election marked the first time that Ontario's city councils will sit for a four-year term; until 2006, municipal elections were held every three years. ==Issues== The primary issue in the 2006 elections was the municipal amalgamation of 2001. Prior to January 1, 2001, the current city of Greater Sudbury consisted of seven separate municipalities, together comprising the Regional Municipality of Sudbury. On that date, the provincial government of Ontario dissolved all seven former municipalities and the regional government, merging them all into the current city government. However, many residents of the outlying communities in the city have alleged that their municipal services have deteriorated significantly since the amalgamation. In early 2006, residents of the former town of Rayside-Balfour began to campaign for the de-amalgamation of the city and the return of the former municipal government structure. The city government has refused to endorse the petition ‚Äî even if the petition were endorsed by the city, however, any de-amalgamation referendum would still require the consent of the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, which has set a number of very strict conditions for permitting a referendum. Mayor David Courtemanche announced an advisory committee, chaired by former Member of Provincial Parliament Floyd Laughren, to consult with communities in the city and seek solutions to their concerns about municipal government services. This committee did not submit its final report to the city until January 10, 2007, several weeks after the 2006 municipal election, although a summary of the issues raised during the initial consultations, as well as an outline of the final report process, was presented in advance of the election. In June 2006, the city was also criticized for its handling of a leave of absence taken by fire chief Don Donaldson, as well as a study which found that Sudbury had the highest-paid mayor and councillors of any Ontario city in its population range. Council has been also criticized for several development-related decisions, including a $13 million expansion of the Kingsway between Minnow Lake and Coniston, a controversial decision to permit construction of a new school and a medical office building on the Lily Creek marshlands near Science North, and a project to increase sewer capacity in the South End (Ward 9) area by construction of a rock tunnel. Following a $4 million budget shortfall in the latter project, the city imposed special development fees on new residential and commercial construction in the neighbourhood. With the recent takeovers of two of the city's major employers, Falconbridge Ltd. by Swiss mining giant Xstrata and Inco Limited by the Brazilian company CVRD, and the recent financial crisis faced by the city's Northern Breweries, the issues of jobs and economic development in the city were also expected to play a role in the election campaign. One of John Rodriguez's campaign planks was to lobby for the city to be given a share of the corporate taxes paid by the mining companies to the federal and provincial governments; the inability to directly tax two of the city's largest employers has been cited in the past as a barrier to the city's economic and social development. Some candidates also cited the desire to see more women serve on council; only six of the 45 declared candidates in the 2006 election were women, and three of those six were incumbent councillors. In the final election results, four of the five women running for council seats were elected; one female ward candidate was not elected, nor was mayoral candidate Lynne Reynolds. ==Mayoral race== Earlier in 2006, local media speculated that former mayor Jim Gordon might run for mayor again as well, but in September he ended that speculation by endorsing Rodriguez; Gordon had endorsed Courtemanche in 2003. Rodriguez was also endorsed by 2003 mayoral candidate Paul Marleau, former city councillor Gerry McIntaggart and the Sudbury and District Labour Council. During the campaign, Rodriguez was sometimes criticized for making potentially unrealistic promises, such as eliminating homelessness in the city, which depended on lobbying the provincial or federal governments for funding and program cooperation that those governments had not guaranteed would be made available. However, both of his main opponents were also criticized as well. Courtemanche, who did not officially declare his candidacy until just a few days before the nomination deadline, was viewed by many voters as having been a weak and ineffective leader during the previous council term, and faced allegations that he had held off his campaign launch until the last minute precisely to insulate himself from having to answer that criticism on the campaign trail. Reynolds, meanwhile, was criticized by the city's media for a vague and confrontational campaign which was critical of the existing council, but offered very few specific new ideas of her own. A Sudbury Star opinion poll published on November 1 placed Rodriguez in the lead with 49 per cent support among decided voters, with Courtemanche trailing at 30 per cent and Reynolds at 20 per cent. The other four candidates had approximately one per cent support combined. On the final weekend before the election, Reynolds garnered the endorsement of the Sudbury Star, while the community newspaper Northern Life endorsed Courtemanche. Both newspapers acknowledged that Rodriguez had been the most successful of the three at defining the issues and direction of the campaign, but cited misgivings about his agenda as their principal reason for choosing not to endorse him. ==Ward boundary adjustments== New ward map for 2006 When the current city of Greater Sudbury was created in 2001, the city was divided into six wards, each of which was represented by two councillors. In 2005, the city council adopted a new ward structure, in which the city would now be divided into twelve wards with a single councillor per ward. This redistribution of wards was itself controversial, because it divided some communities within the city that were formerly closely associated with each other ‚Äî for example, the former town of Rayside-Balfour was split, with Azilda falling in Ward 4 and Chelmsford falling in Ward 3. The original ward structure had also been designed to balance political power, crossing the pre-2001 municipal boundaries to help prevent the urban core of the city from ignoring the needs of the more rural communities. Under the new ward structure, however, five of the twelve wards are purely urban, and it has been alleged that this may weaken the city's ability to respond to the needs of residents outside of the central city. Floyd Laughren's final report on municipal government services, tabled in early 2007, included a recommendation for further adjustments to make ward boundaries more closely correspond to the former municipal divisions. Laughren specifically noted the former towns of Capreol and Onaping Falls as communities that should be reconstituted as their own distinct city wards. ==Results== In addition to David Courtemanche, two incumbent councillors were also defeated ‚Äî notably, both represented wards outside of the pre-2001 city boundaries, and hence may have been vulnerable in part because of the amalgamation referendum controversy. The councillors whose wards were most directly affected by the Kingsway, Lily Creek and South End sewer tunnel controversies were all re-elected. Two wards, both in the old city, had no incumbent councillor running for reelection. In Ward 12, the city's website initially named John Caruso as the winner with 1,798 votes, to challenger Joscelyne Landry-Altmann's 1,756. However, the city later reported an apparent technical error in the upload of vote totals to the website, with 460 votes mistakenly uploaded twice. (This error did not affect the actual vote tabulations, merely the reported totals on the election results webpage.) In the adjusted count, Landry-Altmann won over Caruso by a similarly narrow margin. Caruso called for a recount, which was conducted on December 1 and confirmed Landry-Altmann's victory.The Sudbury Star - Ontario, CA Councillors {  - ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\" width=\\"150px\\"  Candidate ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Vote ! bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  % - colspan=\\"4\\" Ward 1 - Joe Cimino  3,016  68.6 - Carlos Reyes  1001  22.8 - John Mathew  382  8.7 - Robert Allard (withdrawn)   - colspan=\\"4\\" Ward 2 - Jacques Barbeau  1,838  35.81 - Terry Kett (X)  1,730  33.70 - Sandy Bass  1,153  22.46 - Stephen L.

In his inaugural speech, Rodriguez laid out an ambitious \\"first 100 days\\" agenda for change in the city, which included eliminating the transfer fee on the city's TransCab service (which offers taxi service to residents of remote areas of the city not served by Greater Sudbury Transit), and creating citizen committees to oversee a number of projects, including the implementation of Floyd Laughren's report on service improvements in the amalgamated city, reviewing the city's recreational facilities and pursuing the creation of an arts centre, revising the city's corporate taxation base, pursuing economic growth opportunities in the health care sector, and devolving some legislative authority to the existing local community action networks. Rodriguez also ignited some controversy by making two unilateral decisions on his first day in office, reaffirming that stores in the city would not be permitted to open on Boxing Day and authorizing the Franco-Ontarian flag to be flown at Tom Davies Square.Mayor drives home agenda for next 100 days The latter decision invoked polarized opinion, with some praising the mayor for taking authoritative action and others criticizing him for isolating other cultural groups in the community. Reynolds announced in December that she would be a candidate for the Liberal Party nomination for Nickel Belt in the next federal election, following Ray Bonin's announcement that he would retire from office at the end of the current parliamentary session. She later withdrew from the race, endorsing competitor Sylvain Beaudry; however, the nomination was ultimately won by Louise Portelance, who was also a defeated municipal council candidate in 2006. Floyd Laughren tabled his committee report on January 10, 2007, making 34 recommendations for improvements in the city's municipal ward structure, communications, transportation, recreation and transit services. Rodriguez and most council members responded favourably to the report, indicating that they would attempt to implement as many of the recommendations as possible. ==ReferencesExternal links== * City of Greater Sudbury Municipal Election site Category:2006 Ontario municipal elections 2006 ","title":"2006 Greater Sudbury municipal election"},{"id":"5569166","text":"CMLA may refer to: * Canadian Music Library Association, now the Canadian Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres * Chief Martial Law Administrator * Collegiate Middle Level Association ","title":"CMLA"},{"id":"5569183","text":"Nichigo Press, established 1977, is Australia's longest established Japanese language newspaper. ==Etymology== The word nichigo is a romanisation of the Japanese, Êó•Ë±™Ôºà„Å´„Å°„Åî„ÅÜ or nichi'g≈çÔºâ, which literally means \\"Japan-Australia\\". ==Distribution== Three editions are published monthly.

The distance between these two sites is only about 70km. The Shulaveri-Shomu culture has been distinguished during the excavations on the sites of Shomutepe and Babadervis in Western Azerbaijan by I. Narimanov (in 1958-1964) and at Shulaveris Gora in Eastern Georgia by A.I. Dzhavakhisvili and T.N Chubinishvili (in 1966-1976). Discoveries from the sites have revealed that the same cultural features spread on the northern foothills of Lesser Caucasus mountains. ==Background== Shulaveri-Shomu culture covers the 6th-5th millennia BC. According to the material culture examples found in the sites depict that the main activities of the population were farming and breeding. Shulaveri culture predates the Kura-Araxes culture which flourished in this area around 4000‚Äì2200 BC. Later on, in the middle Bronze Age period (c. 3000‚Äì1500 BC), the Trialeti culture emerged.Kushnareva, K. Kh. 1997. The Southern Caucasus in Prehistory: Stages of Cultural and Socioeconomic Development from the Eighth to the Second Millennium B.C. University Museum Monograph 99. Philadelphia: The University of Pennsylvania Museum. Sioni culture of Eastern Georgia possibly represents a transition from the Shulaveri to the Kura-Arax cultural complex.Kiguradze, T. and Menabde, M. 2004. The Neolithic of Georgia. In: Sagona, A. (ed.), A View from the Highlands: Archaeological Studies in Honour of Charles Burney. Ancient Near Eastern Studies Supplement 12. Leuven: Peeters. Pp. 345-398. Building mud-brick circular, oval and semi-oval architecture is typical for this culture. The buildings were in different sizes based on their aim of use. The larger ones with diameters ranging from 2 to 5 m. were used as living areas, while smaller buildings were used as storage (1-2 m diameter).They were researched well during the digging at Shomutepe in Azerbaijan and Shulaveri in Georgia. Especially in recent years as a result of archaeological research in the area of Goytepe, the Shulaveri-Shomutepe culture has been identified as belonging to the 7th millennium BC and the second half of the 6th millennium. Although Shulaveri-Shomutepe complex firstly was attributed to the Eneolithic era, it is now considered as a material and cultural example of the Neolithic era except the upper layers where metal objects have been discovered as in Khramis Didi-Gora and Arucho I. ==Material culture== Sulaveri-Shomu culture is distinguished by circular mud-brick architectures, domestic animals breeding and cultivating cereals. Handmade pottery with engraved decorations, blades, burins and scrapers made of obsidian, tools made of bone and antler, besides rare examples of metal items, remains of plant, such as wheat, pips, barley and grape, as well as animal bones (pigs, goats, dogs and bovids) have been discovered during the excavations. Anthropomorphic figurines of mainly seated women found in the sites represent the items used for religious purposes relating to the fertility cult. Pestles revealed in Shulaveri-Shomu sites were mainly made of basalt (50%), metamorphic rocks (34%) and sandstones (11 %). Territorial clay was used in the production of earthenware. Basalt and grog, later plant materials were used as temper in pottery. Levels of ceramic production in Shulaveri-Shomu: {  I stage Rough pots with jutting base - II stage Finely decorated pottery - III stage Rough coloured and decorated ceramics with flat bases - IV stage Dyed pots - V stage Fine red polished pottery } ==Earliest grapes== The earliest evidence of domesticated grapes in the world has been found in the general \\"Shulaveri area\\", near the site of Shulaveri gora, in Marneuli Municipality, in southeastern Republic of Georgia. Specifically, the most recent evidence comes from Gadachrili gora, near the village of Imiri in the same region; carbon- dating points to the date of about 6000 BC.Nana Rusishvili, The grapevine Culture in Georgia on Basis of Palaeobotanical Data. ‚ÄúMteny‚Äù Association, 2010Peter Boisseau, How wine-making spread through the ancient world: U of T archaeologist. June 17, 2015 - news.utoronto.ca ==Geographical links== Many of the characteristic traits of the Shulaverian material culture (circular mudbrick architecture, pottery decorated by plastic design, anthropomorphic female figurines, obsidian industry with an emphasis on production of long prismatic blades) are believed to have their origin in the Near Eastern Neolithic (Hassuna, Halaf). The technology and typology of bone-based instruments are similar to those of the Middle East Neolithic material culture. A quern with 2 small hollows found in Shomutepe is similar to the one with more hollows detected in Khramisi Didi-Gora. The similarities between the macrolithic tools and the use of ochre also bring Shulaveri-Shomu culture closer to the culture of Halaf. Pestles and mortars found in Shulaveri-Shomu sites and Late Neolithic layers of Tell Sabi Abyad in Syria are also similar to each other. ==See also== *Trialeti culture *Archaeology of Azerbaijan *Prehistoric Armenia *Prehistoric Georgia *Kura-Araxes culture *Goytepe archaeological complex ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:Neolithic cultures of Asia Category:Chalcolithic cultures of Asia Category:Archaeological cultures of West Asia Category:Archaeological cultures in Armenia Category:Archaeological cultures in Azerbaijan Category:Archaeological cultures in Georgia (country) Category:Prehistoric Azerbaijan Category:Prehistoric Georgia (country) Category:Archaeology of the Caucasus ","title":"Shulaveri-Shomu culture"},{"id":"5569226","text":"Titicus Reservoir is one of 12 in the New York City water supply system's Croton Watershed.

It was held on March 3, 2008, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. It was expected to be called early because the governing Progressive Conservatives held a leadership election on December 2, 2006, in which Ed Stelmach was elected to replace Ralph Klein as party leader and Premier. The election was called when Stelmach formally advised Lieutenant Governor Norman Kwong to dissolve the Legislature, which happened on February 4, 2008. With 53% of the popular vote, the Progressive Conservatives won a decisive majority over the Liberal and other parties, despite early suggestions of a closer race. The 2008 election had the lowest voter turnout in the province's history, with only 40.59% of eligible voters casting a ballot. ==Results== The Progressive Conservatives increased their majority at the expense of all other parties in the legislature. The Tories also increased their share of the popular vote, and even though their share of the vote was still significantly less than it was in 2001, they managed to win just two fewer seats than they won in that election. This was largely a result of their continued widespread support in rural areas, as well as divided opposition support in Calgary and Edmonton. The Conservative gains came mostly in and around Edmonton, where the party recorded its best results since 1982. The Liberals held on to official opposition status but sustained a net loss of seven seats. Bucking historic trends, the party was reduced to only three seats in Edmonton, but was able to win five seats in Calgary (a net gain of one seat and the largest total won by that party in that city in the past 50 years). The Liberals also held their existing seat in Lethbridge to win a total of nine seats. The other parties that were represented in the legislature also suffered losses on election night. The New Democrats lost two of their four Edmonton seats, and the Wildrose Alliance Party was shut out of the legislature as their leader Paul Hinman was narrowly defeated in his own constituency of Cardston-Taber-Warner. For the first time in history, a majority of the Liberal caucus were from Calgary and the combined number of Liberal and NDP MLAs from Edmonton did not exceed the number of those two parties' MLAs from Calgary.

The implication is that its volume is proportional to its cubed length, and its surface area to its squared length. This holds for any shape it might have; the actual shape determines the proportionality constants. The reason why the concept is important in the context of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is that food (substrate) uptake is proportional to surface area, and maintenance to volume. Since volume grows faster than surface area, this controls the ultimate size of the organism. Alfred Russel Wallace wrote this in a letter to E. B. Poulton in 1865.see Finch, C. 1990 Longevity, senescence, and the genome Univ Chicago Press Appendix 3 The surface area that is of importance is the part that is involved in substrate uptake (e.g. the gut surface), which is typically a fixed fraction of the total surface area in an isomorph. The DEB theory explains why isomorphs grow according to the von Bertalanffy curve if food availability is constant. Organisms can also change in shape during growth, which affects the growth curve and the ultimate size, see for instance V0-morphs and V1-morphs. Isomorphs can also be called V2/3-morphs. Most animals approximate isomorphy, but plants in a vegetation typically start as V1-morphs, then convert to isomorphs, and end up as V0-morphs (if neighbouring plants affect their uptake). ==See also== * Dynamic energy budget * V0-morph * V1-morph * shape correction function ==References== Category:Developmental biology ","title":"Isomorph"},{"id":"5569285","text":"Setia Tropika Setia Tropika is a township in Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia.

The character appeared sporadically through the years since then, having made appearances in Dazzler #14 (April 1982), Contest of Champions #3 (August 1982), Marvel Age Annual #1 (1985), Captain America #352 (April 1989), Quasar #8 (March 1990), Marvel Super Heroes vol. 3 #3 (September 1990), Quasar #51-53 (October‚ÄìDecember 1993), #57 (April 1994), The Avengers vol. 3 #6 (July 1998), and The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #550 (February 2008) Blue Shield received an entry in the original Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #2, and in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #1. ==Fictional character biography== Joe Cartelli was born in the Bronx, New York. He is the son of Frank Cartelli, who was gunned down by the mob. He became a crime fighter, and started to infiltrate the Barrigan crime family, masquerading as a mobster. At one point, he somehow acquired a belt with micro-circuitry of unknown origin that could give him the Blue Shield powers, and used it to fight his family and various other criminals. He also shortly allied with Dazzler.Dazzler #5 Blue Shield was next seen attempting to join the Avengers,Captain America #352 but was then approached to become security director for Project: Pegasus, a secret research project of the US Government. At that point, the abilities once conferred by the belt were somehow natural for Joe and he could produce the same effects without any visible equipment. He did a good job but resigned after he failed to protect the project from the alien life-form called Omnivore.Quasar #8 However, he later re-accepted the post.Marvel Super Heroes #3 The Initiative Joseph registered with the Initiative, and was assigned to New York, where he worked alongside Jackpot. While chasing a criminal, he comes across Spider-Man, and considers himself more important, and decides to engage him in an attempt to capture him. Jackpot comments that if he could fly, he would have chased Spider-Man after he jumped on Menace's glider.Amazing Spider-Man #550 ==Powers and abilities== The Blue Shield from his first appearance in Dazzler #5, artist Frank Springer. The Blue Shield originally wore a micro circuitry-lined belt which artificially enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and reactions, and endurance to near superhuman levels. However, long-term exposure to the belt's field has altered Cartelli's genetic structure to the point where he no longer requires the belt to increase his physical capabilities. The micro circuitry-lined belt is of both unknown origin and design and grants Cartelli the ability to generate a powerful force field around himself, greatly increasing his body's resistance to physical injury. While surrounded by the field, Cartelli can withstand high caliber bullets, powerful impact forces, heat, punctures, and concussion without sustaining injury. The field not only protected him from physical attack, but it could also filter out harmful gases and protect him from temperature extremes. Though exposure to the belt over the years has granted him superhuman physical powers, he is not able to generate a protective force field around himself without the use of the belt. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Marvel Universe: Blue Shield *MarvelDirectory.com: Blue Shield *Blue Shield profile Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981 Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Italian superheroes Category:Marvel Comics mutates Category:Marvel Comics superheroes ","title":"Blue Shield (comics)"},{"id":"5569380","text":"alt=1923 photograph of Ernest Hemingway \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" is a two-part short story written by American author Ernest Hemingway, published in the 1925 Boni & Liveright edition of In Our Time, the first American volume of Hemingway's short stories. It features a single protagonist, Hemingway's recurrent autobiographical character Nick Adams, whose speaking voice is heard just three times. The story explores the destructive qualities of war which is countered by the healing and regenerative powers of nature. When it was published, critics praised Hemingway's sparse writing style and it became an important work in his canon. The story is one of Hemingway's earliest pieces to employ his Iceberg Theory of writing; a modernist approach to prose in which the underlying meaning is hinted at, rather than explicitly stated. \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" is almost exclusively descriptive and intentionally devoid of plot. Hemingway was influenced by the visual innovations of C√©zanne's paintings and adapted the painter's idea of presenting background minutiae in lower focus than the main image. In this story, the small details of a fishing trip are explored in great depth, while the landscape setting, and most obviously the swamp, are given cursory attention. == Background and publication == In 1922, Hemingway moved with his wife Hadley to Paris, where he worked as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star. He became friends with and was influenced by modernist writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein.Desnoyers, Megan Floyd. \\"Ernest Hemingway: A Storyteller's Legacy\\". JFK Library.

He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal the transatlantic review.Mellow (1992), 271 Gertrude Stein photographed with Hemingway's son Jack in 1924.

Hemingway took her advice, reworked the ending, and wrote to his editor: \\"I have discovered that the last eleven pages of the last story in the book are crap\\".Mellow (1992), 273‚Äì277 Biographer James Mellow writes that at this early stage in his career Hemingway had not developed his talent enough to fully and capably integrate self-reflections in his writing; Mellow also believes the deleted passage might have been a \\"tour-de-force\\" had it been written at a more mature period in Hemingway's development. In January 1925, while wintering in Schruns, Austria, waiting for a response from query letters written to friends and publishers in America, Hemingway submitted the story to be published in his friend Ernest Walsh's newly established literary magazine This Quarter. Walsh bought it for 1,000 French francs, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction.Reynolds (1989), 263, 271 On October 5, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York.Baker (1972), 410; Oliver (1999),169 The last story in the volume was the two-part \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\".Flora (2004), 41 The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig√≠a Edition (1987).Baker (1972), 412; Oliver (1999), 394 The fragment Hemingway cut was published posthumously as a separate short story titled \\"On Writing\\" in 1972 in The Nick Adams Stories.Oliver (1999), 251 == Plot== Part one The story opens with Nick arriving by train at Seney, Michigan, to find that a fire has devastated the town, leaving \\"nothing but the rails and the burned-over country.\\"Hemingway (1973 ed.), 159 While following a road leading away from the town, he stops on a bridge where he observes trout in the river below. After, he hikes up a hill and rests at a burned stump. While smoking a cigarette, he discovers an ash- blackened grasshopper crawling on his sock, and detaches it. His first spoken words in the story are \\"Go on, hopper .... Fly away somewhere.\\"Hemingway (1973 ed.), 162 Later in the day he relaxes in a glade of tall pines and falls asleep. When he wakes, he hikes the last mile to the edge of the river where he sees the trout feeding in the evening light \\"making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were starting to rain.\\"Hemingway (1973 ed.), 164 He pitches his tent, unpacks his supplies, cooks his dinner, fills his water bucket, heats a pot of coffee, and kills a mosquito before falling asleep. Part two Early the next morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy grasshoppers found under a log he names a \\"grasshopper lodging- house\\",Hemingway (1973 ed.), 169 eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee and makes a sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, he walks to the river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that \\"was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color\\"Hemingway (1973 ed.), 172 that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, \\"as broad as a salmon\\",Hemingway (1973 ed.), 174 which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp. == Themes ==  War  Hemingway saw World War I as the \\"central fact of our time\\". \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" hints at both widespread physical devastation and Nick's personal war and post-war experience, but neither of these central facts are directly mentioned.Flora (2004), 43 Hemingway scholar Joseph Flora makes the observation that Hemingway portrays Nick's character coping \\"more meaningfully than he had ever done before, with the issues of life and death\\".Flora (2004), 42 Biographer Phillip Young sees the story as basically concerned with a description of a young man \\"trying desperately to keep from going out of his mind.\\"Young (1973), 8‚Äì9 Nick returns wounded, and introduces a character type Hemingway used again in his later stories and novels. The theme of an unspecified wound is introduced, a device that was to culminate in Jake Barnes' character in The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway scholar William Adair suggests that Nick's war experience was different, and perhaps more traumatic than Hemingway's own, writing that Nick's unspecified wound should not be confused or automatically identified with Hemingway's wound.Adair (1991), 586 WWI shrapnel wounds. Although Hemingway's best fiction such as \\"Big Two- Hearted River\\" perhaps originated from the \\"dark thoughts\\" about the wounding,Benson (1989), 352 Jackson Benson believes that autobiographical details are employed as framing devices to make observations on life in general and not just Nick's own experiences. He writes that Hemingway created \\"what if\\" scenarios from real situations in his early fiction, which he projected onto a fictional character‚Äî\\"What if I were wounded and made crazy?\\" the character asks himself. Benson goes on to write that \\"much of Hemingway's fiction is dream-like‚Äîhis early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare, as in the recurring imagery of In Our Time.\\"Benson (1989), 351 Adair views the river setting as a fictional representation of the Piave River near Fossalta, the site of Hemingway's mortar wound. Hemingway may have taken the idea of the swamp from the terrain in the battle of Portogrande‚Äîa battle that Hemingway wrote about in a 1922 newspaper story, saying of it: \\"Austrians and Italians attacked and counter-attacked waist deep in swamp water\\".qtd. in Adair (1991), 585 Furthermore, Adair suggests that Hemingway's own wounding is reflected in the scene where Nick loses a fish‚Äîthe \\"biggest one I ever had\\"‚Äîwith descriptive imagery such as shoes \\"squelchy\\" with water, suggestive of Hemingway's recollection of \\"feeling as if his boots were filled with warm water (blood) after his wounding.\\"Adair (1991), 586‚Äì587 Writing in A Moveable Feast, Hemingway remembered \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\", recalling when he \\"sat in a corner with the afternoon light coming in over my shoulder and wrote in the notebook .... When I stopped writing I did not want to leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. The story was about coming back from the war but there was no mention of the war in it.\\"qtd. in Flora (2004), 43  Nature  Hemingway's stories typically position nature as a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence‚Äîespecially at the moment when prey is killed.Stoltzfus (2005), 215‚Äì218Berman (2011), 66 In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption.Flora (2004), 44 In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well for the first time since the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.Flora (2004), 51 Hemingway's descriptions of the Michigan landscape, which would have been familiar to him as in his youth he summered at the family's Walloon Lake cottage in Northern Michigan, are presented in a vague and dreamlike manner. Ronald Berman sees Hemingway's treatment of landscape as like a painter's canvas on which he presents Nick's state of mind.Berman (2011), 61 The descriptions of the river's water have been compared to American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau's descriptions of the pond in Walden. Biographer Meyers sees the story as a blend of American primitivism and sophistication; Nick evidences a sense of loss which is \\"not simply grace under pressure‚Äîbut under siege\\".Meyers (1985), 145 Nature is perceived as good and civilization as bad‚Äîa pervasive theme in American literature, found in such American classics as Mark Twain's 19th-century Huckleberry Finn and in William Faulkner's 20th-century Go Down, Moses.Flora (2004), 46 According to Hemingway scholar Susan Beegel, Hemingway is fundamentally an American nature writer. She attributes it to his upbringing: his mother, Grace Hemingway, believed avidly in the early 20th-century \\"back to nature\\" movement, and his father was a physician who taught science to his son, taking him to Agassiz Movement meetings as a young boy. Hemingway's affinity with nature is reflected most strongly in \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\", in broad strokes whereby he has Nick traveling deep into the American back- country to find solace, and in small details such as his Agassiz \\"object oriented\\" descriptions of the grasshoppers.Beegel (2000), 63‚Äì71 ==Style ==  Iceberg theory  Hemingway was inspired by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence can be seen in the stripped-down, minimalist style characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound \\"taught [me] more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive\\". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose.Meyers (1985), 74, 126 Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism;Benson (1975), 285‚Äì287 biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to \\"get the most from the least, [to] prune language, [to] multiply intensities, [to] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth\\". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.Baker (1972), 117 The iceberg theory has been termed the \\"theory of omission\\". Hemingway believed a writer could convey an object or concept while writing about something entirely different. In \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" he elaborates on the mundane activities Nick carries out. The story is filled with seemingly trivial detail: Nick gathers grasshoppers, brews coffee, catches and loses a large trout. In this climactic event, however, the excitement and tension becomes so strong that Nick betrays his inner thoughts and he takes a break. While Hemingway painstakingly describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely hints at the driving force of the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war.Oliver (1999), 321‚Äì322 Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing \\"'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war .... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted.\\"qtd. in Johnston (1984), 32 Flora believes that in \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" the concept of the iceberg theory is more evident than in any other piece written by Hemingway. Paul Smith believes Hemingway was still only experimenting stylistically during In Our Time. He maintains that Hemingway's later minimalist style can be seen here, but not so much from tight editing as from Hemingway's first approach, his desire to emulate his influences. Hemingway's sentences \\"began life as scrawny little things, and then grew to their proper size through a process of accretion.\\"Smith (1996), 45 He avoided complicated syntax to reflect Nick's wish that the fishing trip be uncomplicated. An analysis of the text shows that about 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences‚Äîa childlike syntax without subordination‚Äîand that repetition is often substituted for subordinate thoughts. Furthermore, the repetition creates prose with a \\"rhythmic, ritualistic effect\\" that emphasizes important points. The lengths of the paragraphs vary with short paragraphs intensifying the action.Wells (1975), 130‚Äì133 Benson writes that in \\"Indian Camp\\" and \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" Hemingway's prose was sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and that by employing simple sentences and diction‚Äîtechniques he learned writing for newspapers‚Äîthe prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality. C√©zanne Hemingway said of Paul C√©zanne's In the Forest of Fontainebleau that \\"This is what we try to do in writing, this and this, and woods and the rocks we have to climb over\\". Hemingway greatly admired C√©zanne and early in his career crafted his prose in a way that would resonate with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that \\"C√©zanne is my painter after the early painters .... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul C√©zanne, I learned how ... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times.\\"qtd. in Berman (2007), 39 Hemingway wanted the structure of \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" to resemble a C√©zanne‚Äîwith a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background.Johnston (1984), 31 In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, \\"I have finished two long stories ... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like C√©zanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up\\".Baker (1981), 122 His description of the river and the countryside betray the influence of the Post-Impressionist style. Hemingway was heavily influenced by the modernists.Berman (2011), 11 He often visited the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, where he saw three C√©zanne paintings, L'Estaque, Cour d'une ferme, and Les Peupliers. A series of C√©zanne watercolors were exhibited at Berheim-Jeune Gallery before he began writing the story. Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that he had been \\"learning something from the painting of C√©zanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them.\\"qtd. in Johnston (1984), 28‚Äì30 L'Estaque, Melting Snow, C√©zanne, c. 1871 Comparing \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" to C√©zanne's paintings, Berman observes that Hemingway established a \\"representation of form, space and light\\", and that the dense descriptive passages give \\"light and form .... overwhelmingly visual, intensely concerned with spatiality\\", while in the middle ground, \\"We sense [the trees] through vertical forms and dark colors only\\". Like C√©zanne paintings, Hemingway's landscapes are vague and do not represent any specific place: Seney burned in 1891, not in 1919; the hill Nick climbs does not exist; and the east branch of the Fox River, where he camps, is not a day's hike from the town.Berman (2007), 40 Kenneth Johnston believes Hemingway's use of symbolism is a substitute for paint and brushstrokes. He views the description of the town after the fire, and the railroad tracks, as words \\"slash[ed] across the landscape\\", with a physicality similar to a C√©zanne landscape.Johnston (1984), 32‚Äì36 The minutely detailed passages of the campsite and Nick's mundane activities fill the story's foreground, while the forest and menacing swamp, relegated to the background, are described vaguely and only in passing. The river acts as a barrier between the foreground and background, and is present as deep in places, shallow in others, with currents that are either slow or fast. Berman says Nick is shown as a figure in a painting‚Äîseen in the foreground at the campsite and at a distance from the murky background of the swamp.Johnston (1984), 31‚Äì32  Symbolism  Nick is incapable of self-reflection and unable to cope with pain. Hemingway conveys this through symbolism and a series of objective correlatives (tangible objects), which allow the reader insight to the character's motivations.Zapf (2005), 161 For example, on his arrival in Seney he literally falls off the train, shocked at the sight of the burned town, but on a deeper level in shock from his war experience. Leaving behind the burnt landscape, Nick climbs a hill in the heat, and surveys the town's damage. The burning and heat symbolize his memory of war-torn Italy, but he hopes for regrowth: \\"It could not all be burned. He knew that\\". At the top of the hill, he takes a break, smokes a cigarette, and speaks for the first time. Flora suggests that speaking symbolizes his humanity, lost in the war, which he is beginning to regain.Flora (2004), 44‚Äì45 Beyond the town the bridge over the river still exists and the river symbolizes time and timelessness, healing and the natural cycle of life and death. Nick is on a journey, perhaps he sees it as a religious quest given the Christian symbolism of the fish. From the town, a road leads into pristine back-country. It crosses a bridge under which the trout hold steady against the current, just as Nick needs to hold steady. From the bridge he glimpses a kingfisher taking wing, a bird Johnston points out symbolizes \\"halcyon days, peace and tranquility\\". A large uprooted tree symbolizes the protagonist himself uprooted by war, and that his fragility is symbolized by the trout he releases carefully so as not to damage its protective slime coat. The campsite symbolizes safety, set deep in a pine grove and described in soothing greens; beyond three dead trees in the background looms the swamp where he will not venture. His tent is portrayed as a less dark place than the emptiness outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.Flora (2004), 55‚Äì58 == Reception == In Our Time was published as part of Pound's modernist series by Three Mountains Press, Paris in 1924. The work was well received by critics; Edmund Wilson described the writing as \\"of the first distinction\\",qtd. in Wagner-Martin (2002), 4 and in the 1940s he again wrote of \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\", \\"along with the mottled trout ... the boy from the American Middle West fishes up a nice little masterpiece.\\"Wilson (2005 edition), 9 When the story was published in the United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style.Mellow (1992), 314 In 1952, reviewing The Old Man and the Sea‚Äîfor which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature‚ÄîThe New York Times said of \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" that it was one of the \\"best and happiest of his early short stories\\".Davis, Robert Gorham (September 7, 1952). \\"Hemingway's Tragic Fisherman\\". The New York Times. Archived from the original on February 15, 2001. Retrieved June 26, 2012. Carlos Baker views the stories of In Our Time as a remarkable achievement for a young writer.Baker (1972), 21 Joseph Flora described \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\" as \\"unquestionably the most brilliant of the collection In Our Time\\". The piece has become one of Hemingway's most anthologized stories, and one of a handful subject to serious literary criticism since its publication, and belongs in the canon of 20th-century American literature. Beegel writes that it is considered \\"among the best\\" American short stories, along with Stephen Crane's \\"The Open Boat\\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"Young Goodman Brown\\" and Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\".Beegel (1992), 3 According to Benson, despite Pound and Joyce's influence, Hemingway \\"carried the new form into the position of dominant influence\\" for much of the 20th century. Unlike other modernist writers, who wrote of man cut off from the past, Hemingway placed his narratives in the present and hence became \\"the true modernist\\". == References ==  Citations   Sources  * Adair, William (1991). \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\": Why the Swamp is Tragic\\".

He emigrated to the United States, and was later murdered in 1993 in North Carolina by former police officer Lamont C. Underwood as part of a love triangle.Dagens Nyheter, 2 February 1994. ==Assassination of Olof Palme== Gunnarsson (labeled in the media 33-√•ringen, \\"the 33-year-old\\") was an early suspect for the assassination of Olof Palme on the late evening of 28 February 1986, in Stockholm, Sweden. He was taken in for questioning a first time on 8 March, but released the same evening, but taken in again on 12 March. On 17 March, he was taken into custody and the prosecutor made a request to the court to have Gunnarsson detained. After evidence against him had weakened, primarily due to less weight being placed on identification near the scene by one eyewitness, he was released on 11 April. However, Gunnarsson continued to be the subject of continued telephone surveillance for some period of time.De olika sp√•ren i Palmeutredningen: 33-√•ringen var misst√§nkt , Sveriges Television 2006-02-23 . Gunnarsson had connections to various right wing political groups. He was a member of the European Workers Party, the Swedish branch of the LaRouche movement, for a year before being kicked out in 1985. Also, EWP pamphlets, featuring much anti-Palme content, were found in his home outside Stockholm. Gunnarsson suffered protracted harassment on account of his status as a suspect in Palme's murder. In time, he emigrated to the United States. ==Death== Gunnarsson's nearly-naked body was found in a wooded area called Deep Gap about 86 miles from his apartment in Salisbury, North Carolina. He had been shot twice in the head with a .22 caliber firearm. The date of death was placed at 3 or 4 December 1993. Investigation came to focus on former policeman Lamont C. Underwood, the obsessive ex-fiance of Kay Weden. Gunnarsson and Weden had been dating for a few months at the time of his death. Underwood was convicted of Gunnarsson's murder in 1997 and sentenced to life imprisonment plus 40 years.http://www.leopoldreport.com/LRsajt27.html Underwood was additionally convicted of murdering Catherine Miller, Kay Weden's mother; the motive for both murders was argued to have been Underwood's desire to cause suffering for Weden in retaliation for her breaking up with him.NO. COA98-648, North Carolina Court of Appeals, Filed: 17 August 1999 In January 2010, a judge sitting in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina ruled that Underwood had suffered from ineffective counsel and ordered that he be granted a new trial or be released from prison in 180 days. That decision was overturned and the new trial denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in January 2011. The appeals court ruled that even if Underwood's lawyers had been ineffective as he claimed, the evidence against him was so overwhelming that his counsels' alleged lack of competence would have been immaterial.Lamont Underwood v.

Federal Reserve officers have the same authority as any other federal law enforcement officer while on duty, regardless of their geographic location. Prior to designation as federal law enforcement officers, system protection personnel operated as protection or special police officers in their respective states and were generally regulated to exercising authority on Federal Reserve property, with variances dependent on specific district regulations. Prior to federal law enforcement designation, there were no plainclothes or specialized units in the system. Following the passage of updated legislation by Congress after the events of September 11, 2001, which designated federal law enforcement authority to system officers, authority now extends to wherever a federal reserve law enforcement officer is performing official duties, whether in uniform, plainclothes, or in a specialized unit. == Functions == Each Federal Reserve law enforcement office in the twelve regional districts are independent law enforcement units, though governed loosely out of Washington, D.C. Many of the law enforcement districts have dual city or state police authority in addition to their federal authority. This separate authority allows for the enforcement of state and/or city laws, in addition to the Federal Code. The primary duty of uniformed division officers is to provide general law enforcement and force protection services to Federal Reserve facilities, whether owned or leased. Federal Reserve officers respond to police, fire and medical incidents in and adjacent to their assigned facilities to protect life, render aid or assist other law enforcement. Each Federal Reserve office operates a 24/7 emergency communications (command) center. Federal Reserve officers are authorized to conduct investigations involving Federal Reserve regulations, but assist with local, state and federal investigations into criminal matters that affect the Federal Reserve. Some Federal Reserve districts employ sworn officer intelligence analysts while others utilize non-sworn civilians. Each district has a dignitary protection team, which provide armed plainclothes protection to the twelve Federal Reserve presidents. Protective driving and off-site special event security of other Federal Reserve officials is regularly performed throughout the country. There are five Special Response Teams (SRT) based in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Richmond, as well as New York City, which are designed to respond nationwide. Additionally, Explosive Detector Dog teams, Active Shooter/Patrol Rapid Response teams and Hazardous Materials teams are assigned to several Federal Reserve districts throughout the nation, often traveling to other regions on temporary assignments.  Equipment  Officers are certified to carry a variety of weapons systems, including semi- automatic pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns. They also carry less lethal weapons including pepper spray, batons, tasers, and other standard police equipment. Officers also wear body armor in both covert and overt forms. Each district can choose the make and model of all police equipment the officers are issued. Federal Reserve Police car in St. Louis On October 12, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law S.B. 1132 the \\"Law Enforcement Officers' Safety Act Improvements Act\\", which states that law enforcement officers of the Federal Reserve are \\"qualified law enforcement officers\\" and thus are authorized to carry a firearm off-duty. This update to the Law Enforcement Safety Act, among other aspects, clarified that federal law enforcement officers working for Amtrak and the Federal Reserve (not funded by Congress) are specifically granted the same rights as publicly funded law enforcement officers as it relates to off-duty concealed carry. A Ford Taurus Police Interceptor in FRP service, in New York City. A Ford Expedition of FRP, near Boston Federal Reserve Bank. Each district can choose the make, model and style of police vehicles, which vary based on location and weather. There are both marked and unmarked police cars in the Federal Reserve fleet. == Employment == Federal Reserve Law Enforcement Officers must complete basic training at one of the regional Federal Reserve Police training centers, which are nationally accredited by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC). All Federal Reserve Police Instructors are certified by FLETC or Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST). The Federal Reserve System runs regional FLETC-accredited training academies throughout the nation. In some districts, where officers are cross-designated as local‚Äìstate law enforcement officers, additional training is provided to comply with the governing POST. Some (but not all) districts offer a lateral entry program that allows certification with minimal training for those with prior police training and experience. Because the Federal Reserve System is independent of the federal government, Federal Reserve Law Enforcement officers have a benefit system separate from, but similar to, public federal employees. Each district has a different pay scale based on the local cost of living index and provides compensation packages comparable to other law enforcement officers in the area. System officers are provided a fully paid (non-contribution) defined pension plan, in addition to a matching thrift savings program. ==Fallen officers== Since the establishment of the Federal Reserve Police, two officers have been killed in the line of duty. * Captain Earl R.

The first attempt at creating the series occurred in 1993, but shut down due to financial troubles. In 2002, a second attempt at the series was created. To assist the series with financial backing, Dennis consulted Joe Gibbs Racing owner Joe Gibbs, and also added Interstate Batteries president Norm Miller and PACE Entertainment and PACE Motorsports' Gary Becker as investors. To help promote the series, James Ukrop, former chairman of Ukrop's Food Group, was hired as a business mentor for Dennis. JGR drivers Tony Stewart, Denny Hamlin and J. J. Yeley also became investors. Regarding the series, Stewart stated, \\"I love any kind of racing, but arena racing struck me as something that could really take off. I've raced Midgets and Sprint Cars indoors, and there's definitely an added level of excitement. When I found out you could do the same thing with a half-scale stock car, but on a banked track with 14 other cars around you while making laps in 10 seconds, I was in.\\" ==Details== Arena Racing uses stock cars half-scale of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars at long, and can reach speeds up to . They weigh about and have 22-horsepower engines. Events are scheduled in a heat style format, as opposed to NASCAR's format of one long race.

Ziegler: Catalogue des steles, peintures et reliefs egyptiens de l'Ancien Empire et de la Premiere Periode Intermediaire, Musee du Louvre, Paris 1990, pp. 54-57 Egyptologists are discussing the chronological position and historical figure of Qahedjet. == The stela ==  Description  The stela of king Qahedjet is 50.5 cm high, 31.0 cm wide and 3.0 cm thick and made of finely polished limestone. It was bought in 1967 by the Louvre at Paris, where it is now on display. The front shows king Qahedjet embracing an anthropomorphic form of the god Horus. King Qahedjet wears the White crown of Upper Egypt and an artificial king's beard, and looks directly into Horus' eyes, both figures being the same height. His face looks remarkable with his crooked nose, the bulging lips and his square chin. The king wears a kilt with a dagger in a belt. In his left hand, he holds a mace while in his right hand he holds a staff with a wing-like mark at middle height. Horus has laid his right arm around Qahedjet's shoulder and holds Qahedjet's elbow in his left hand. The hieroglyphic inscription describes the king's visit to the northern shrine of the god Ra at Heliopolis.Jean-Pierre P√§tznik, Jacques Vandier: L‚ÄôHorus Qahedjet: Souverain de la IIIe dynastie?. page 1455‚Äì1472.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/New York 1999, , page 104‚Äì105.  Authenticity  The authenticity of Qahedjet's stela is questioned by Egyptologists such as Jean-Pierre P√§tznik and Jacques Vandier. They point to several stylistic contradictions that can be found within the relief motif. Firstly, they stress that the earliest known depiction of an anthropomorphic Horus is found in the pyramid temple of Sahure, second pharaoh of the 5th Dynasty. Secondly, they argue that the motif of a king embracing a god (or a god embracing a king) would be highly unusual for the Old Kingdom, since the king was then seen as the living representation of Horus (and Seth), but not seen on a par with them in this way. Depictions showing a king in an intimate pose with a god would therefore be heretical and provocative at the same time. Detail of the stela. Further arguments of P√§tznik and Vandier concern the inscriptions right of Qahedjet's serekh. The hieroglyphic signs are unusually shifted to the right and they are not square in arrangement. This contradicts the Egyptian rules of calligraphy on royal monuments. Additionally, the details on the owl-sign (value m) of the stele do not appear before the first half of the 18th Dynasty and the stele would represent the earliest formulation Horus + m + toponym. Finally, serekh names involving a royal crown as a hieroglyphic symbol are otherwise only known from king Thutmose III of the 18th Dynasty onwards, and P√§tznik and Vandier remark that Qahedjet is known to be a variant of Thutmose III's Horus name, so that the stele, if authentic, could be an archaistic work of the New Kingdom. Alternatively, the square face of Qahedjet, that reminds the viewer so much of that of king Djoser, makes them think that the stela could be an archaistic production from the much later Sait period. During this era reliefs with clear hommages to the art of the Old Kingdom were seen as ‚Äúen vogue‚Äù. As an example, P√§tznik and Vandier point to a naos of Djoser found at Heliopolis (now in fragments), that shows Djoser sitting on a Hebsed-throne. Djoser appears nearly identical in the reliefs of his necropolis at Saqqara, but a small guiding inscription reveals that the naos was built in the 7th-6th century BCE, during the Saitic period. Their last argument concerns the word Hut-a'a (meaning \\"great palace\\"), the place which Qahedjet is represented visiting. The way Hut-a'a is written on the stela is known not to be in use before the very end of the Old Kingdom and become common only from the time of king Senwosret I of the 12th Dynasty onwards. Furthermore, Hut-a'a is generally identified with the temple of Ra in Heliopolis, which is located in Lower Egypt while Qahedjet wears the crown of Upper Egypt. On the other hand, reliefs from Djoser's pyramid complex always depict the king wearing the crown corresponding to the places he is shown visiting. Thus, the several contradictions in the relief's artistic program make Jaques Vandier and Jean- Pierre P√§tznik wonder if the stela is authentic or just a modern fake. The uncertain origins of the stela, which was acquired by the Louvre in 1967 from a private antique dealer in Cairo only lends more weight to this possibility. == Identity of Qahedjet== Assuming its authenticity, Jacques Vandier proposed in his first study of the stele in 1968 that it be dated to the 3rd Dynasty on stylistic grounds, suggesting that Qahedjet be identified with king Huni, the last ruler of the dynasty. Toby A.H. Wilkinson and Ian Shaw are of the same opinion: they think that \\"Hor-Qahedjet\\" was the serekh name of Huni, although this assumption is only based on that Huni is the only king of this dynasty whose Horus name is unknown (the name \\"Huni\\" is a cartouche name only). Thus, their theory is not commonly accepted.Ian Shaw: The Oxford history of ancient Egypt. page 88.Jacques Vandier: Comptes Rendus de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie des Inscriptions et des Belles-Lettres. 1968, page 16‚Äì22. Similarly, J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Rainer Stadelmann and Dietrich Wildung considered Qahedjet to have ruled toward the end of the 3rd Dynasty. Again, their theory is based on the stylistic resemblances between Qahedjet's face and that of king Djoser on reliefs from his pyramid complex.Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros, D√ºsseldorf 2002, . page 315.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der √§gyptischen K√∂nigsnamen. Deutscher Kunstverlag, M√ºnchen/ Berlin 1984, . page 52 & 117. Finally, one must mention that Peter Kaplony dated the stela to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt.Peter Kaplony: Die Rollsiegel des Alten Reiches (= Monumenta Aegyptiaca, vol. 3).

A set can be defined with or without parameters, which are elements of the domain that can be referenced in the formula defining the relation. == Definition == Let \\\\mathcal{L} be a first-order language, \\\\mathcal{M} an \\\\mathcal{L}-structure with domain M, X a fixed subset of M, and m a natural number. Then: * A set A\\\\subseteq M^m is definable in \\\\mathcal{M} with parameters from X if and only if there exists a formula \\\\varphi[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m,y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n] and elements b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n\\\\in X such that for all a_1,\\\\ldots,a_m\\\\in M, :(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_m)\\\\in A if and only if \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\models\\\\varphi[a_1,\\\\ldots,a_m,b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n] :The bracket notation here indicates the semantic evaluation of the free variables in the formula. * A set A is definable in \\\\mathcal{M} without parameters if it is definable in \\\\mathcal{M} with parameters from the empty set (that is, with no parameters in the defining formula). * A function is definable in \\\\mathcal{M} (with parameters) if its graph is definable (with those parameters) in \\\\mathcal{M}. * An element a is definable in \\\\mathcal{M} (with parameters) if the singleton set \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} is definable in \\\\mathcal{M} (with those parameters). == Examples ==  The natural numbers with only the order relation  Let \\\\mathcal{N}=(\\\\mathbb{N},<) be the structure consisting of the natural numbers with the usual ordering. Then every natural number is definable in \\\\mathcal{N} without parameters. The number 0 is defined by the formula \\\\varphi(x) stating that there exist no elements less than x: \\\\varphi= eg\\\\exists y(y and a natural number n>0 is defined by the formula \\\\varphi(x) stating that there exist exactly n elements less than x: \\\\varphi=\\\\exists x_0\\\\cdots\\\\exists x_{n-1}(x_0 In contrast, one cannot define any specific integer without parameters in the structure \\\\mathcal{Z}=(\\\\mathbb{Z},<) consisting of the integers with the usual ordering (see the section on automorphisms below).  The natural numbers with their arithmetical operations  Let \\\\mathcal{N}=(\\\\mathbb{N},+, \\\\cdot, <) be the first-order structure consisting of the natural numbers and their usual arithmetic operations and order relation. The sets definable in this structure are known as the arithmetical sets, and are classified in the arithmetical hierarchy. If the structure is considered in second-order logic instead of first-order logic, the definable sets of natural numbers in the resulting structure are classified in the analytical hierarchy. These hierarchies reveal many relationships between definability in this structure and computability theory, and are also of interest in descriptive set theory.  The field of real numbers  Let \\\\mathcal{R}=(\\\\mathbb{R},0,1,+,\\\\cdot) be the structure consisting of the field of real numbers. Although the usual ordering relation is not directly included in the structure, there is a formula that defines the set of nonnegative reals, since these are the only reals that possess square roots: \\\\varphi=\\\\exists y(y\\\\cdot y\\\\equiv x). Thus any a\\\\in\\\\R is nonnegative if and only if \\\\mathcal{R}\\\\models\\\\varphi[a]. In conjunction with a formula that defines the additive inverse of a real number in \\\\mathcal{R}, one can use \\\\varphi to define the usual ordering in \\\\mathcal{R}: for a,b\\\\in\\\\R, set a\\\\le b if and only if b-a is nonnegative. The enlarged structure \\\\mathcal{R}^{\\\\le}=(\\\\mathbb{R},0,1,+,\\\\cdot,\\\\le)s is called a definitional extension of the original structure. It has the same expressive power as the original structure, in the sense that a set is definable over the enlarged structure from a set of parameters if and only if it is definable over the original structure from that same set of parameters. The theory of \\\\mathcal{R}^{\\\\le} has quantifier elimination. Thus the definable sets are Boolean combinations of solutions to polynomial equalities and inequalities; these are called semi-algebraic sets. Generalizing this property of the real line leads to the study of o-minimality. == Invariance under automorphisms == An important result about definable sets is that they are preserved under automorphisms. :Let \\\\mathcal{M} be an \\\\mathcal{L}-structure with domain M, X\\\\subseteq M, and A\\\\subseteq M^m definable in \\\\mathcal{M} with parameters from X. Let \\\\pi:M\\\\to M be an automorphism of \\\\mathcal{M} which is the identity on X. Then for all a_1,\\\\ldots,a_m\\\\in M, ::(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_m)\\\\in A if and only if (\\\\pi(a_1),\\\\ldots,\\\\pi(a_m))\\\\in A This result can sometimes be used to classify the definable subsets of a given structure. For example, in the case of \\\\mathcal{Z}=(\\\\mathbb{Z},<) above, any translation of \\\\mathcal{Z} is an automorphism preserving the empty set of parameters, and thus it is impossible to define any particular integer in this structure without parameters in \\\\mathcal{Z}. In fact, since any two integers are carried to each other by a translation and its inverse, the only sets of integers definable in \\\\mathcal{Z} without parameters are the empty set and \\\\mathbb{Z} itself. In contrast, there are infinitely many definable sets of pairs (or indeed n-tuples for any fixed n > 1) of elements of \\\\mathcal{Z}, since any automorphism (translation) preserves the \\"distance\\" between two elements. == Additional results == The Tarski‚ÄìVaught test is used to characterize the elementary substructures of a given structure. == References == *Hinman, Peter.

It was written by Gary Gygax and published by TSR in 1982 for the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;) rules. The 64-page adventure bears the code \\"S4\\" (\\"S\\" for \\"special\\") and is set in the Greyhawk campaign setting. It is divided into two parts, a 32-page adventure, and a 32-page booklet of monsters and magic items. The plot involves the player characters investigating rumors of lost treasure. After traversing a wilderness and two levels of dungeons, the players face Drelnza, the vampiric daughter of long-deceased archmage Iggwilv. The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth is a revised and expanded version of The Lost Caverns of Tsojconth, a tournament adventure that Gygax wrote for the 1976 WinterCon V gaming convention. Gygax expanded the tournament adventure by adding a wilderness area, with part of it based on earlier work by Rob Kuntz. Work on the adventure delayed the completion of The Temple of Elemental Evil, another Gygax adventure. The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was included in the 1987 supermodule Realms of Horror, and updated for v3.5 in an online edition in 2007. It was well received by critics, ranked the 22nd greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004. A White Dwarf reviewer gave the adventure 9/10, noting its difficulty and rewards of powerful magic. It is part of a series along with S1: Tomb of Horrors, S2: White Plume Mountain, S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. It also has a loosely connected sequel: The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun. ==Plot summary== The introduction, with instructions that the Dungeon Master read it aloud to the players, outlines that there is a treasure in the Yatil Mountains south of the Greyhawk realm of Perrenland. The player characters must investigate rumors of a lost treasure that scores of adventurers have perished attempting to find. The treasure is a remnant of the wealth amassed by the archmage Iggwilv, former ruler of Perrenland, prior to her presumed death at the hands of the demon Graz'zt, whom she had \\"imprisoned and forced into servitude.\\" The players must first traverse a wilderness area with 20 numbered encounters before arriving at the caverns. The encounters have names such as \\"Border Patrol\\" (encounter 1) and \\"Hill Giants\\" (encounter 10). After the wilderness are two lettered encounters: the \\"Gnome Vale\\", which includes a map for their lair, and \\"The Craggy Dells\\", where humans and orcs are capturing hippogriffs to sell. Next, the player characters reach the caverns. They consist of the \\"Lesser Caverns\\" with 22 encounters, and the \\"Greater Caverns\\" with 20 encounters, each with its own map. The lesser caverns include encounters such as \\"Stinking Cave\\" (encounter 5) which contains four trolls and \\"Underground Lake\\" (encounter 14). The greater caverns include encounters such as \\"Uneven- Floored Cavern\\" (encounter 5) where the player characters face an umber hulk and \\"Canyon of Centaurs\\" (encounter 9). The 20th and final encounter is titled \\"The Inner Sphere\\". Here, a \\"woman sleeps on an alabaster slab.\\" She is \\"armored from toe to neck in gold chased plate mail.\\" The woman is actually Drelnza, a fighter/vampire and the daughter of Iggwilv. After defeating Drelnza, the players are rewarded with treasure, and the adventure ends. ==Publication history== The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth is a revised and expanded version of The Lost Caverns of Tsojconth, a tournament adventure that Gygax wrote for WinterCon V, a gaming convention sponsored by the Metro Detroit Gamers (MDG) in 1976. It is based in part on one of Rob Kuntz's dungeon levels, as Kuntz helped Gygax revise the tournament version. This original version consisted of eight loose sheets, an outer folder, and a zip- locked bag; only several hundred copies were printed. In the May 1980 issue of Dragon, Gygax said \\"Rob Kuntz has the reworked Lost Caverns module which must be finalized\\" and that \\"We want to get it into print as soon as possible.\\" Lawrence Schick later suggested that \\"there's evidence that Gary considered Tsojcanth part of a longer Greyhawk campaign, placing the adventure between T1‚ÄìT4 The Temple of Elemental Evil and WG4 The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun. (By this reckoning, The Village of Hommlet, The Temple of Elemental Evil, and Tsojcanth are thus the \\"lost\\" WG1 through WG3 modules.) So, Tsojcanth was published in the S series because it got completed out of order, but was too good to delay.\\" In 1980, Gygax began rewriting the adventure for first edition AD&D;, expanding it to include outdoor encounters. The redevelopment of The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was one of the major delays in the completion of The Temple of Elemental Evil.Anonymous. \\"RPGA Interview with... E. Gary Gygax.\\" 'RPGA News' (TSR, Autumn 1981). This version of the module was revised and expanded, and included two 32-page books, and an outer folder. In the November 1981 issue of Dragon, Gygax said that TSR needed a competition-level module and that \\"the effort needed to finish the second hundred or so pages of Elemental Evil went into preparation of The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. The scenario was initially done for a convention tournament, but the new product has an extensive outdoor adventure and a completely new series of encounters\\". While in the middle of working on Temple of Elemental Evil, Gygax added a complete outdoor story arc to the original tournament story arc that leads to the caverns. The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth includes new spells, and many new monsters which were later featured in Monster Manual II. The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun (1982) starts off from an event in The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth and features monsters from the Fiend Folio. In 1987, The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was revised and included in TSR's \\"supermodule\\" Realms of Horror. In 2007, it was updated to v3.5 and included as one of three parts in Iggwilv's Legacy: The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, an adventure available online from Wizards of the Coast. Both versions of the module included monsters that were later included other Dungeons & Dragons products. The monsters introduced in the original un-published version were updated for AD&D; rules and included in the first edition Monster Manual. Monsters appearing in the published version included the demon princes Baphomet, Fraz-Urb'luu, Graz'zt, and Kostchtchie, who later appeared in the original Monster Manual II.Gygax (1982), Monsters and Magical Items booklet The published module's cover features an illustration of a behir by Erol Otus. All four modules of the S-series were included as part of the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick writes in the foreword that \\"S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth marked the end of the S series‚Äîand rightly so, because despite being based on a gilded-hole dungeon originally designed for a tournament in 1976, its updated version really belonged more to the '80s campaign-setting school of design than to the wild-and-woolly '70s. S1 through S3 were standalone modules that could be easily dropped into any DM's campaign, but Tsojcanth is firmly based in Gary's World of Greyhawk.\\" ==Reception== The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth was favorably received by critics. Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, described the adventure as \\"A monster-filled labyrinth in the classic mode: kill 'em, rob 'em, and leave.\\" It was ranked the 22nd-greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. Dungeon's editors felt that the \\"pedestrian character of the caverns echoes the adventure's primordial nature\\", while its complicated wilderness setting and large second booklet set it apart from other adventures of the time. The booklet introduced 30 new creatures, including the derro and the demon lords Baphomet and Graz'zt. The reviewers felt that the adventure's defining moment was when the players find Iggwilv's \\"fabled treasure\\": her vampire daughter Drelzna. Jim Bambra reviewed the adventure for White Dwarf. He gave it 9/10 overall, with 9/10 for presentation, rules, playability, enjoyment, skill, and complexity. Bambra noted that the module ended a long time off for Gary Gygax, and was \\"very tough\\" and that good play was stressed in the introduction. Sub par play quickly ended the story, but the rewards of powerful magic and the satisfaction of completing a difficult task made it worthwhile. He also noted that the adventure came with a 32-page booklet with 30 new monsters and a small amount of new magic. Not all the new creatures are featured in the plot, but they can be used by the DM in other adventures. Also, magical diagrams are given an in-depth treatment, including their creation and effectiveness.

It was manufactured by Mackie, but distributed by Emagic. About 6 months later, Mackie introduced a physically identical product called \\"Mackie Control\\" which included support for most major DAW applications, but not Logic. The Emagic Logic Control was still available and would only work with Logic. Later, Mackie Control's firmware was revised to include compatibility with Logic, combining together Mackie Control, Logic Control and Human User Interface (HUI) into a single protocol. As a result, the name was changed to \\"Mackie Control Universal\\" (MCU). Out of the box, MCU included Lexan overlays with different button legends to support control of other DAWs such as Pro Tools and Cubase. ==Description== Logic Control (and now MCU) allows control of almost all Logic parameters with hardware faders, buttons and \\"V-Pots\\" (rotary knobs). Its touch-sensitive, motorized faders react to track automation. All transport functions and wheel scrubbing are also available. The unit also controls plug-in parameters.

Oakbrook Center is a shopping center located near Interstate 88 and Route 83 in Oak Brook, Illinois. It was originally opened in 1962. It is the second largest shopping center in the Chicago metropolitan area by gross leasable area, only surpassed by Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois. Current anchor stores include Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. The upscale stores featured at the mall are a collection slightly beneath the boutique-style, exorbitant stores at malls such as South Coast Plaza in Orange County, California and the traditional mix of mall stores found at other larger malls like Woodfield Mall and the Mall of America. ==History== Oakbrook Center, which was originally to be named Oakbrook Terrace (but the name was changed when a town near the mall took that name), opened in 1962 with Sears and Marshall Field's, as well as a Jewel Food Store. Bonwit Teller was later added, as was Lord & Taylor in 1973 on the south side. I. Magnin, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Neiman Marcus joined the center in a 1981‚Äì1982 expansion that doubled the physical size of the center with a new southeast court. On Christmas Day 1964, a single-screen movie theater operated by Balaban & Katz Corporation (later taken over by Plitt Theatres) was opened at the Oakbrook Center near Saks Fifth Avenue. On its thirty-third year of operation in 1987, the single screen theater was split into four screens when Cineplex Odeon Corporation took it over. Cineplex Odeon also added another four screens, topped by additional retail (including a bookstore), near the Saks Fifth Avenue anchor; these screens closed in 2001 and then reopened in 2018. Bonwit Teller closed their location in 1990, while I. Magnin was shuttered in January 1991, with its former site subdivided in 1994 for specialty stores, including Eddie Bauer and Tiffany & Company. In 1991, a new two-story, open-air addition opened northeast of Sears. Built on top of a parking garage, it added of mall retail and a Nordstrom. Maggiano's Little Italy opened that same year. Corner Bakery Cafe opened to customers on December 3, 1992. In 1998, Urban Outfitters and Wildfire Restaurant opened. Saks Fifth Avenue closed its store in 2002 and sold the location to Federated Department Stores, which used the site to open a 90,000-square-foot, three- story Bloomingdale's Home store on September 12, 2003. Cheesecake Factory opened in August 2004. Marshall Field's adopted the Macy's name on September 8, 2006 with Macy's buying the parent company. On November 12, 2008, Barnes & Noble opened. A year later, in 2009, American Apparel (which closed in 2017) opened. In 2010, Gibson's Bar and Steakhouse opened across the street from the Mall. Forever 21 opened in the mall in April of that same year. Pandora opened its doors in 2011. General Growth Properties acquired a half-interest and management of the mall in 2004, when it acquired The Rouse Company (which had itself acquired its stake the mall in 2002). It is currently co-owned by Brookfield Properties Retail Group and CalPERS. Pinstripes opened as a stand- alone location in the mall parking lot in 2012. In November 2013, Perry's Steakhouse opened in the former basement level of Neiman Marcus. On January 4, 2012, Bloomingdale's announced that it would close its Oakbrook Home store by March of the year. Two years later in 2014, that building was split and fully leased out to six smaller tenants: The Container Store on the first level; Lululemon Athletica, Tommy Bahama, Hugo Boss, and Aritzia on the second level; and the first PIRCH store outside of California on the third level. PIRCH closed its store on September 30, 2017 as it returned to its original California roots. In August 2014, Le M√©ridien opened a 172 guest-room hotel in a former Renaissance Hotel, which was originally a Stouffer Hotel. This is their first in the state of Illinois. On June 20, 2017, Sears announced that its Oakbrook Center store would be closing temporarily in September 2017. It reopened on October 5, 2018, using only the first level of the building, while the leftover space will be occupied by KidZania on the third level and parts of the second level by 2020. The remaining space on the second floor is occupied by Ballard Designs and L.L. Bean, the latter of which opened on November 9, 2018, and the former of which opened during fall 2018. Additionally, the Sears Auto Center at Oakbrook Center closed permanently in March 2018. The land that the center sat on will be occupied by a fitness center that will open sometime in 2020. On February 26, 2018, it was announced that Lord & Taylor would be closing permanently in January 2019. Also in 2018, AMC Theatres opened a new 12-screen cinema in a remodeled section of the Nordstrom wing; this remodeling also included a new food hall named \\"The District.\\" On April 22, 2019, only seven months after reopening, it was announced that Sears would be closing permanently on April 28, 2019. ==Bus routes== Pace * 301 Roosevelt Road https://www.pacebus.com/route/301 * 322 Cermak Road/22nd Street https://www.pacebus.com/route/322 * 332 River Road/York Road https://www.pacebus.com/route/332 * 877 Harvey/Downers Grove Limited https://www.pacebus.com/route/877 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Website * Encyclopedia of Chicago entry * Oakbrook Center Review Category:1962 establishments in Illinois Category:Oak Brook, Illinois Category:Shopping malls established in 1962 Category:Shopping malls in DuPage County, Illinois ","title":"Oakbrook Center"},{"id":"5569626","text":"La Compagnie Cr√©ole is a popular French pop band from French Guiana and the French West Indies, who started singing in the 1980s.

The director, Gregor, tries to convince her to complete the scene by telling her stories of sexual relations over the centuries. In the end, Dinah decides to complete the filming. Coppola inserted scenes to the original German plot, adding the bellboy, George, who tries to spend some time with a room full of women. ==Production== The German production starring Karin Dor and Willy Fritsch was in black and white but Coppola said that he filmed around 15 minutes of footage in 3D and in color to add to the American release. The new footage featured nude women and took Coppola a few days to complete. Coppola said that the project was \\"adding five three-minute nudie sketches in color to a stupid German movie that had been shot in black-and- white\\". Al Locatelli designed the sets for the new segments while Jack Hill was the cinematographer. June Wilkinson, a Playboy Bunny, is featured in the segments. The 3-D footage was shot in Optavision and supervised by Richard Kay. During the production one of the girls stated to Coppola that she was only 17 and that her father was going to kill her. Coppola responded with, \\"Well, you can keep your bra on,\\" which resulted in him being reprimanded by the producer after he saw the completed film. Hill received $25 for his work on the film and Coppola received $250. Coppola was a student at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and his classmates did not agree with his choice of going into exploitation films. Coppola said, \\"I was called a cop-out, because I was willing to compromise\\". The film print was believed to be lost after the film's initial release in 1962 and subsequent release on videotape but a collector of Coppola memorabilia had a print of the film. The book Godfather: The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola states that \\"Coppola's color footage is easily identifiable in the finished film\\" and that \\"the five Coppola sequences add up to nearly fifty minutes of screen time\\".

He was canonized in 1199 at the urgent request of the citizens of Cremona. He died on November 13, 1197 and his feast day is celebrated on November 13. He was a merchant from Cremona, northern Italy. Born Omobono Tucenghi, he was a married layman who believed that God had allowed him to work in order that he would be able to support people living in a state of poverty. His name is derived from the Latin homo bonus (\\"good man\\"). Homobonus was able to pursue this calling in life easily as a result of the inheritance he received from his father, a prosperous tailor and merchant. He practiced his business at Cremona with scrupulous honesty. He also donated a large proportion of his profits to the relief of the poor. Homobonus was a frequent church attendee that would partake in the Eucharist every day. While attending mass, prostrated in the form of a cross, on November 13, 1197, Homobonus died. Fourteen months later Homobonus was canonized by Pope Innocent III. In the bull of Homobonus's canonization Pope Innocent III called him \\"father of the poor\\", \\"consoler of the afflicted\\", \\"assiduous in constant prayer\\", \\"man of peace and peacemaker\\", \\"a man good in name and deed\\", \\"this saint, is still like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in our time.\\" The church of Sant'Omobono in Rome is dedicated to him. ==Homobonus in popular culture== In recent years, statuettes of Saint Homobonus are being sold as novelty items or executive toys in the United States.

Based on Fafnir of Norse mythology, Fafnir first appeared in a two-part back-up story in Thor #134-135 (Nov.-Dec. 1966). The character did not feature again in Marvel continuity until Thor #318 (April 1982), and was finally killed in a storyline in Thor #341-343 (March‚ÄìMay 1984). Fafnir returned from the dead (referred to as King Fafnir of Nastrond) in Thor #486-488 (May‚ÄìJuly 1995). ==Fictional character biography== Fafnir is first encountered in the guise of an old man by the warrior Volstagg, who with his companions is currently exploring the ruined realm of Nastrond, an extradimensional realm on the continent of Asgard. Fafnir explains he was the King of Nastrond, and that the King of the Norse Gods Odin destroyed Nastrond due to the evil nature of its people. Fafnir himself was left to die in a ruined wasteland, but survives by drinking from a pool of water with magical properties. The water, however, transforms Fafnir into a massive dragon. Knowing that Volstagg and his allies were sent by Odin, Fafnir uses the power of illusion and intends to devour the Asgardians. Odin's son Thor, however, defeats Fafnir by driving the dragon into a chasm using his lightning, after which he frees Volstagg.Thor #134-135 (Nov.-Dec. 1966) Fafnir reappears when Thor's stepbrother and perennial foe Loki sends the dragon to Earth to kill the Thunder God. Thor, however, uses his mystical hammer Mjolnir to hold Fafnir at bay until Odin intervenes and banishes the former king back to the ruins of Nastrond.Thor #318 (April 1982) Fafnir eventually returns to Earth, destroys several abandoned buildings in New York City and battles the National Guard. Thor and Elif, the elderly chief and last survivor of a lost Viking colony armed with a spear blessed by Odin himself, arrive to battle. They are almost defeated, but Elif gives up his life to drive the spear into Fafnir, and Thor hammers it in all the way, slaying Fafnir. Thor gives Elif a noble Viking funeral by burning Fafnir's body atop his corpse.Thor #341-343 (March‚ÄìMay 1984) Fafnir was released from Hel alongside the Midgard Serpent, Fafnir of Jotunheim (a frost giant), Nidhogg, Farsung the Enchanter, an Ice Giant and two Ice Dwarves by Kurse to battle Thor and Lady Sif. The threat of these entities is stopped when Thor agrees to go to Hel's realm willingly.Thor #486-488 (May‚ÄìJuly 1995) Fafnir later reappears in the 2011 limited series Avengers Prime in the aftermath of the Siege storyline as, at first, an adversary then ally of Thor, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers with several legions of ogres and elves in battle against a Twilight Sword wielding Hela and her army.Avengers Prime #1-5 (November 2010 - March 2011) ==Powers and abilities== Fafnir was originally a normal man until transformed by the properties of a magical pool into a large dragon.

Coppola's friend and fellow director George Lucas worked as an aide on this film, and made a short documentary titled Filmmaker about the making of the film. The film also won the Golden Shell at the 1969 San Sebastian Film Festival. The film received mixed reviews, but modern reception is more often positive. The current DVD release from Warner Archive appears to be from a 16mm print. ==Plot summary== Natalie Ravenna (Shirley Knight) sets off on a drive in a family station wagon. She gives a ride to a strapping young man, Killer (James Caan), who had been a college football star but had sustained a serious head injury and was given one thousand dollars to go away. On their first night together, in Natalie‚Äôs motel room, she orders Killer around and makes him show her his muscular body. She tells him she is pregnant and had given him the ride to have a one-night affair with him, but then she sends him to his own room. Natalie drives Killer to the home of a one-time girlfriend of his whose father had once promised him a job, but that family wants nothing to do with him and Natalie takes him with her when she drives away. While they travel west she twice comes close to finding him work and a place to stay, only to decide that Killer would be taken advantage of. She also twice leaves him at the side of the road, only to change her mind. At their next stop Natalie makes a collect phone call and it is revealed that she left a husband at home when she took off. During a subsequent call days later her husband pleads with her to return home, saying he will do anything to make her happy.

The film features about 2-minutes and 44 seconds of footage filmed on the streets of Chattanooga, Tennessee amid the city's annual Armed Forces Parade. A majority of the clips were shot near the main intersection of what is today Martin Luther King Boulevard and Market Street. ==Reception== Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and compared Natalie Ravenna's quest to that of the Peter Fonda character in Easy Rider, and called them both \\"lineal descendants of the most typical American searcher of them all, Huckleberry Finn.\\" He concluded: \\"It's difficult to say whether his film is successful or not. That's the beautiful thing about a lot of the new, experimental American directors. They'd rather do interesting things and make provocative observations than try to outflank John Ford on his way to the Great American Movie.\\" According to TVGuide.com: \\"This odd odyssey was not a hit, even though over the years it has been regarded as one of Coppola's more personal pictures and has attained a limited following.\\" Margarita Landazuri writes on TCM.com: \\"It has acquired a cult status as an early feminist film for its provocative treatment of a woman seeking her own identity.\\" The work currently has an 82% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Standing tall, it is located within the Upper East Side Historic District as designated in 1981 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. ==History== Charles Pierre Casalasco left his father's restaurant in Ajaccio, Corsica, where he had started as a busboy,Casalasco and the founding of The Pierre follows the account in (Simon 1978), reported on-line at the City Review. assumed Charles Pierre as his full professional name, and began work at the Hotel Anglais in Monte Carlo.Glamorized history reports his father as owner of the Hotel Anglais, and Charles Pierre as rubbing shoulders with the Russian grand dukes and European royalty who patronized his father's hotel. Charles Pierre went on to study haute cuisine in Paris, and he later traveled to London where he met the American restaurateur, Louis Sherry, who offered him a position. After Pierre arrived in New York as a 25-year-old immigrant, he made his first mark as first assistant at Sherry's Restaurant and became professionally acquainted with members of the Social Register, as well as newer millionaires like J. P. Morgan and the Vanderbilts. After nine years at Sherry's,\\"Smart women were beginning to smoke in public rooms.

The Rotunda At the height of his success, dissatisfied with the increasing democratization of public manners, Pierre sold his restaurant and entered a joint venture with a group of Wall Street financiers, \\"among them Otto H.

The 714-room hotel that rose 41 stories on the site of the Gerry mansion at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 61st Street allowed for unrestricted views of Central Park. It cost $15 million (approximately $ million in ) to build and opened to grand fanfare in October 1930 as The Pierre. The building was designed by the New York firm of Schultze and Weaver as a skyscraper that rises in a blond-brick shaft from a limestone-fronted Louis XVI base.Schultze, Leonard, S. Fullerton Weaver, Marianne Lamonaca, and Jonathan Mogul. Grand Hotels of the Jazz Age: the Architecture of Schultze & Weaver. Miami Beach: Wolfsonian-Florida International University, 2005. Its topmost floors render it an easily recognizable landmark on the New York skyline; they are modeled after Mansart's Royal Chapel at Versailles, a system of Corinthian pilasters and arch-headed windows, with octagonal ends, under a tall, slanted, copper roof that is pierced with bronze-finished bull's-eye dormers. New York society turned out to attend the gala dinner that marked the opening of The Pierre; it was prepared by Auguste Escoffier, \\"the father of French chefs\\", who served as a guest chef at The Pierre in its early years. As markets continued to collapse during the Great Depression, The Pierre went into bankruptcy in 1932. The oilman, J. Paul Getty, bought it for about $2.5 million in 1938 (approximately $ million in ) and subsequently sold many cooperative apartments in the building. Beginning in 1948, New York City's ABC television and FM radio station (then called WJZ-TV Channel 7 and WJZ-FM 95.5, now WABC- TV and WPLJ) broadcast from a tower atop The Pierre, until moving to the Empire State Building a few years later. President-elect Richard M. Nixon stayed at The Pierre for several months in 1968-69 before moving to Washington, D.C. The Pierre was the scene of the Pierre Hotel robbery in 1972, organized by the Lucchese crime family. This robbery of $27 million would later be listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest, most successful hotel robbery in history. Today, the hotel contains 189 guest accommodations, including 49 suites, of which 11 are grand suites. Dining options in the hotel include Perrine restaurant, The Rotunda and Two E Lounge. ==Ownership== The Pierre came under the management of the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts in 1981. In its 75th anniversary year in 2005, The Pierre became a Taj Hotel as Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, a global chain of fine luxury hotels and resorts, succeeded as the new lessee and operator.

In Australia there are 90 harness racing tracks, which hold over 1,900 meetings annually. There are approximately 2,900 drivers and 4,000 trainers with about 5,000 Standardbred horses foaled and registered each year. Harness Racing at the 2007 Inter Dominion Championships held at Globe Derby Park in South Australia in January 2007 ==Racing== Harness racing in Australia is conducted with Standardbred horses racing around a track while pulling a driver in a two- wheeled cart called a \\"sulky\\", \\"gig\\" or \\"bike\\". Standardbred racehorses compete in two gaits, pacing and trotting, and trotters may enter pacing events, but not vice versa. Pacers contest 80% to 90% of Australian harness races. Races are conducted in an anti-clockwise direction generally over distances from 1,609 metres (1 mile) to 2,650 metres, although some races such as the A G Hunter Cup are run over longer distances. Harness racing tracks typically measure from 700 to 1,000 metres.Government report Retrieved 15 May 2010 Racing is administered by Harness Racing Australia (HRA) (formerly known as the Australian Harness Racing Council), with each State's Principal Racing Authority agreeing to abide by, and to enforce the rules and regulations.Australian Harness Racing Rules & Regulations Retrieved 2010-5-15 Race meetings are often conducted at night, with many major metropolitan meetings held on Friday and Saturday nights. Standardbred racing in Australia differs slightly from American racing, in that it uses the metric system to measure distances and there are often more starters in a race. Races are started in one of two ways, either from behind a mobile barrier, using a mobile start or behind tapes from a standing start. The mobile barrier is usually a car or ute with two long arms, behind which the horses line up before moving to the starting line. The barrier may cover the entire track and in some cases the mobile can be ten horses wide. When the wings of the gate swing back, the starting vehicle speeds off, thus releasing the horses. This is the most common method of starting pacers and trotters in Australia. The Australian International Design Awards winning AVA Integrity Mobile starting gates are used in Australia and include auto start. This innovation allows the starter to concentrate on the horses and contributes to integrity and fairness during the \\"score up\\". The modern starting gates use only a driver for steering the vehicle and a starter in the rear to observe the race and call a false start if required. Retrieved 2010-5-15 A standing start is made where horses stand flat footed behind an elastic tape that is connected across the track. Usually there are multiple tapes across the track at 10 or 5 metre intervals; this allows handicappers to handicap horses. This may be done on wins in certain classes or on a discretionary basis. Both pacers and trotters races are conducted from standing starts. ==Major races== Aerial view of Moonee Valley Racecourse, showing the light coloured harness racing track.

However the barrier was deemed unsafe after two races and it took a further 9 years before further attempts were made. The prototype hydraulically operated mobile barrier was introduced into NSW in 1963 by William (Bill) George Smith, a Sydney motor body builder who had a passion for harness racing and wanted to make it more exciting for the public and punters. On 14 October 1970 in an article on the success of the Miracle Mile the Sydney Morning Herald reflected on the introduction of new barrier in 1965. The article stated that after months of testing the barrier at Sunday gymkhanas, shows and trials during 1964 and 65 it was then decided to introduce the barrier at Harold Park.

Initially trotting events were scheduled for Trotting under saddle and Hack trots. Various allowances were made for horses measuring under 15 hands 1 inch, too. In 1893 hopples were used for the first time in a race at a Kensington, New South Wales meeting on the imported gelding, Plain Bill. Early in the twentieth century races for trotters drawing light carts or high two- wheeled sulkies were introduced and later specially designed light, smaller wheeled gigs were used.

The film is a co-production between the United States, Romania, France, Italy and Germany. It was the first film that Coppola had directed in ten years, since 1997's The Rainmaker. The film premiered at the 2007 Rome Film Festival. It was distributed through Sony Pictures Classics in the United States (where it was released on December 14, 2007) and by Path√© Distribution in France. The music was composed by Argentinian classical composer Osvaldo Golijov. In an interview, Coppola said that he made the film as a meditation on time and on consciousness, which he considers a \\"changing tapestry of illusion\\", but he stated that the film may also be appreciated as a beautiful love story, or as a mystery. ==Plot== In 1938, Dominic Matei (Tim Roth), a 70-year-old professor of linguistics, pining after the love of his youth, Laura (Alexandra Maria Lara), travels to Bucharest, the city where he and she met at university. Feeling that his fruitless search for the origin of human language has condemned him to a solitary, wasted life, Dominic is intent on committing suicide after this one last journey. However, while crossing the street, he is abruptly yet non-lethally struck by lightning. In hospital, Professor Stanciulescu (Bruno Ganz) informs Dominic that, much to both their surprises, the lightning appears to have regenerated him into a much younger man. Soon after, while residing at the Professor's home, Dominic also discovers that he possesses strange, psychic capacities. As Romania is invaded by Nazi Germany, Doktor Josef Rudolf (Andr√© Hennicke) begins to show an interest in Stanciulescu's miracle patient. Since Dominic's budding powers have blurred his perception of reality, he is bamboozled into mistaking a Nazi spy known only as the Woman in Room Six for an erotic fantasy, who discovers during their nights together that he has developed a talent for speaking in tongues. Meanwhile, an alternate persona, invisible to human eyes, presents itself to Dominic as his \\"Other\\" from outside space and time. When Dominic asks for proof, the \\"Other\\" obliges by bringing him two roses out of nowhere. Unbeknownst to Dominic, Stanciulescu has witnessed the event and overhears his friend ask himself, \\"Where do you want me to put the third rose?\\" Understanding the Nazis' designs, Stanciulescu persuades Dominic to escape from Romania. Living like a spy, Dominic eventually winds up in Switzerland towards the end of the war, where he is confronted by Doktor Rudolf at gunpoint in an alleyway. Rudolf argues that Dominic's existence supports the Nazis' ideal of the superman, and that the coming nuclear conflicts can only be survived by a superior species of man. In the background, the \\"Other\\" confirms this to be the case. However, in refusing to cooperate, Dominic manifests telekinetic powers which manipulate Rudolf into shooting himself. Subsequently, Dominic returns to a normal existence and resumes his linguistic research. Having realised that the lightning strike has partially lent him the capacities and knowledge of future humanity, he develops a secret language for his audio diary, to be deciphered long after the nuclear apocalypse. Many years later, Dominic encounters a woman named Veronica (Alexandra Maria Lara) while hiking in the Alps. The \\"Other\\" reveals her to be the reincarnation of Laura. When the mountains are hit by a violent thunderstorm, Dominic rushes to her rescue and finds her chanting in Sanskrit, which he greets her with to gain her trust. During her stay in hospital, Veronica now identifies herself as \\"Rupini\\", one of the first disciples of the Buddha. Suspecting she may now be afflicted with a condition similar to his own, Dominic calls the Roman College of Oriental Studies for aid, who inform him that Rupini's last act in life was to retire into a cave for meditation on Enlightenment. Since the cave's location is unknown, the scholars, led by Professor Giuseppe Tucci (Marcel Iure»ô), agree to fund an expedition to find it in India, hoping Veronica's past self will guide them. The venture proves a success when a local Boddhisatva recognises \\"Rupini\\" and directs her to the place of meditation. Following this discovery, Veronica becomes herself again and falls for Dominic. The couple elope to Malta, where for a time, they live happily together, until Dominic tells Veronica in her sleep that he has always loved her. This causes Veronica to writhe in bed as if possessed and begin chanting a language even he does not understand. The \\"Other\\" explains that she is speaking in ancient Egyptian, having travelled further back along the path of her past selves. For the next two weeks, Dominic learns how to control this state in Veronica, leading her to regress ever further in time and speak previously unknown tongues. However, Veronica's health begins to decline from exhaustion, and Dominic declares that he cannot continue these sessions, or even being close to Veronica, since his proximity to her is accelerating her age. Over the objections of both Veronica and the \\"Other\\", he leaves. Despairing, Dominic returns to the town where he taught as a professor. His alter ego appears to him in a mirror and reveals the future of mankind; nuclear warfare will unleash an electromagnetic pulse, giving birth to a new, powerful human species, of which Dominic is but the first member. Veronica symbolised the dawn of man, and he stood for the dusk. Outraged at the idea of sacrificing millions of lives in the name of evolution, Dominic shatters the mirror, causing the \\"Other\\" to vanish, yelling incoherently in an unfamiliar language. In the morning, townsfolk find Dominic's body, lying dead at the bottom of a staircase. As Veronica's voice is heard echoing \\"Where do you want me to put the third rose?\\", the rose appears in Dominic's lifeless grasp. ==Cast== *Tim Roth as Dominic Matei *Alexandra Maria Lara as Laura, Veronica *Bruno Ganz as Professor Stanciulescu *Andr√© Hennicke as Josef Rudolf *Marcel Iure»ô as Professor Giuseppe Tucci *Adrian Pintea as Pandit *Matt Damon (uncredited) as Ted Jones, a reporter for Life magazine *Adriana Titieni Irimescu - Anetta *Alexandra Pirici as the woman in Room 6 ==Reception== Box office Youth Without Youth grossed $244,397 in North America and $2.4 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.6 million. Critical response , the film holds a 32% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 105 reviews with an average rating of 4.71/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Although visually appealing, Coppola's latest film mixes too many genres with a very confusing plot.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The New York Times gave it high praise, writing, \\"In this film Mr. Coppola blurs dreams and everyday life and suggests that through visual and narrative experimentation he has begun the search for new ways of making meaning, new holy places for him and for us.\\". Variety, however, was \\"disappointed\\" by the \\"mishmash plotting\\" and \\"stilted script\\". Rex Reed panned the film, writing, \\"You know a movie is doomed when the only star in it is Tim Roth. You know it's pretentious when the ads print the logo backward and upside down. Not one word of this bilge makes one lick of sense, and it is two hours and six minutes long. The only way to survive Youth Without Youth is dead drunk.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, stating that \\"[t]here is such a thing as a complex film that rewards additional viewing and study, but \\"Youth Without Youth,\\" I am afraid, is no more than it seems: a confusing slog through metaphysical murkiness.\\" In 2016, Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com included the film in his video series \\"The Unloved\\", where he highlights films which received mixed to negative reviews that he believes to have artistic value. He stated that Coppola \\"made a film he would have wanted to see, with energy borrowed from his heroes. But this film is all him, really. What other major American director would throw out studio money just to scamper around Europe re-living the years of his father's prime? .... I saw the human struggling to change the world through his work, and the ways in which he failed himself, and I felt for him.\\" The film was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 23rd Independent Spirit Awards. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:2007 films Category:2000s fantasy drama films Category:American films Category:American fantasy drama films Category:Romanian films Category:Romanian fantasy drama films Category:French films Category:French fantasy drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian fantasy drama films Category:English-language films Category:Akkadian language Category:German films Category:German fantasy drama films Category:German-language films Category:French-language films Category:Italian-language films Category:Russian-language films Category:Romanian-language films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Latin-language films Category:Armenian-language films Category:Egyptian-language films Category:Constructed languages Category:Films directed by Francis Ford Coppola Category:Films with screenplays by Francis Ford Coppola Category:Films set in Bucharest Category:Films set in Uttar Pradesh Category:Films about language and translation Category:Films about writers Category:Films based on Romanian novels Category:Films based on works by Mircea Eliade Category:Films produced by Francis Ford Coppola Category:Films set in 1938 Category:Films set in 1969 Category:Films set in Malta Category:Films set in Switzerland Category:Films shot in Romania Category:American nonlinear narrative films Category:American Zoetrope films Category:Films about Buddhism Category:Films about reincarnation Category:Madhyamaka Category:Metaphysical fiction films Category:World War II films Category:Films about psychic powers Category:Films shot in Bulgaria Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Youth Without Youth (film)"},{"id":"5569734","text":"Jimmy Vivino (born January 10, 1955) is an American guitarist, keyboard player, singer, producer,Jazz Times, pg 105 and music director.

Burroughs and Kurt Cobain. ==Plot== On Christmas day, penniless and withdrawing from opiates, Danny emerges from a 72-hour stay in a police holding cell. Hoping to make enough money to buy his next hit of heroin, he scours the streets looking for something to steal. After an unsuccessful attempt to break into a parked car, he discovers an unattended suitcase sitting in a doorway. He makes off with the case and takes it to an abandoned park to examine its contents. There he finds that the case contains two severed human legs. Disgusted, he discards the legs and tries to find a buyer for the suitcase. He finds a buyer who gives him three dollars but also informs him that the local heroin dealer has been arrested. Unable to find heroin anywhere Danny decides to visit a doctor with the hopes of obtaining some morphine. When he reaches the doctor‚Äôs house he pretends to be suffering from facial neuralgia. The doctor is suspicious but gives Danny a quarter of a grain of morphine free of charge. With his morphine tablet secreted away, Danny rents a room for two dollars. As he prepares to inject the morphine, he hears groaning coming from the next room. Distracted, he follows the sound of the groaning across the hall to find a young man suffering from kidney stones. Danny offers to call an ambulance, but soon realizes that the paramedics will not come as they believe the young man is faking illness to obtain opiates.

In most cases both volume and surface area are proportional to length The reason the concept is important in the context of the Dynamic Energy Budget theory is that food (substrate) uptake is proportional to surface area, and maintenance to volume. The surface area that is of importance is that part that is involved in substrate uptake. Since uptake is proportional to maintenance for V1-morphs, there is no size control, and an organism grows exponentially at constant food (substrate) availability. Filaments, such as fungi that form hyphae growing in length, but not in diameter, are examples of V1-morphs. Sheets that extend, but do not change in thickness, like some colonial bacteria and algae, are another example. An important property of V1-morphs is that the distinction between the individual and the population level disappears; a single long filament grows as fast as many small ones of the same diameter and the same total length. ==See also== * Dynamic Energy Budget * V0-morph * isomorph * shape correction function ==References== Category:Developmental biology Category:Metabolism ","title":"V1-morph"},{"id":"5569772","text":"Comedy may be divided into multiple genres based on the source of humor, the method of delivery, and the context in which it is delivered.

Earthquakes of magnitude 5 or higher occur about every eight years, the Guardian Unlimited reports ( 22 October 2002) the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake appears to have been one of the largest in the recorded history of England, Flanders or northern France. Its effects started to be felt in London at around six o'clock in the evening of 6 April 1580, being Wednesday in the Easter week.(pp. 410, Romeo and Juliet: J.B. Lippincott London & Philadelphia, 1871) ==Location and magnitude== A study undertaken during the design of the Channel Tunnel estimated the magnitude of the 1580 quake at 5.3‚Äì5.9 and its focal depth at 20‚Äì30 km, in the lower crust. The Channel Tunnel was therefore designed to withstand those tremors. Being relatively deep, the quake was felt over a large area and it is not certain where the epicentre was located. The Channel Tunnel study proposed three possible locations, two south of Calais and one offshore. The barycentre of the isoseismals with intensities IV to VII lies in the Boulonnais, 10 km east of Desvres, the barycentre of the VII isoseismal lies about 1 km northeast of Ardres, and the barycentre of the only pleistoseismal zone lies in the English Channel. The British Geological Survey estimates the magnitude to be 5.7‚Äì5.8 . ==Records== The earthquake is well recorded in contemporary documents,An earlier destructive quake, of 1382, is also well recorded in southern England and Flanders UK Earthquakes including the \\"earthquake letter\\" from Gabriel Harvey to Edmund Spenser mocking popular and academic methods of accounting for the tremors. It fell during Easter week, an omen-filled connection that was not lost on the servant-poet James Yates, who wrote ten stanzas on the topic: :Oh sudden motion, and shaking of the earth, :No blustering blastes, the weather calme and milde: :Good Lord the sudden rarenesse of the thing ::A sudden feare did bring, to man and childe, :::They verely thought, as well in field as Towne, :::The earth should sinke, and the houses all fall downe. :Well let vs print this present in our heartes, ::And call to God, for neuer neede we more: :Crauing of him mercy for our misdeedes, ::Our sinfull from heart for to deplore, :::For let vs thinke this token doth portend, :::If scourge nere hand, if we do still offend. Yates' poem was printed in 1582 in The Castell of Courtesy.James Yates, \\"Verses written for a requisite remembrance of the earth quake which happened on Wednesday the 6. of April. 1580. between 5. and 6. of the clocke at night of the same day\\". English writer Thomas Churchyard, then aged 60, was in London when the quake struck and he drafted an immediate account which was published two days later. In his 2007 biography of Richard Hakluyt, historian Peter C. Mancall provides extensive extracts from Churchyard's 8 April 1580 pamphlet, A Warning to the Wyse, a Feare to the Fond, a Bridle to the Lewde, and a Glasse to the Good; written of the late Earthquake chanced in London and other places, the 6th of April, 1580, for the Glory of God and benefit of men, that warely can walk, and wisely judge. Set forth in verse and prose, by Thomas Churchyard, gentleman.Mancall, Peter C. Hakluyt's Promise: An Elizabethan's Obsession for an English America (Yale University Press: 2007) pp. 64‚Äì67. Mancall notes that Churchyard's pamphlet provides a sense of immediacy so often lacking in retrospective writing. According to Churchyard, the quake could be felt across the city and well into the suburbs, as \\"a wonderful motion and trembling of the earth\\" shook London and \\"Churches, Pallaces, houses, and other buildings did so quiver and shake, that such as were then present in the same were toosed too and fro as they stoode, and others, as they sate on seates, driven off their places.\\" The English public was so eager to read about the quake that a few months later, Abraham Fleming was able to publish a collection of reports of the Easter Earthquake, including those written by Thomas Churchyard, Richard Tarlton (described as the writing clown of Shakespeare's day), Francis Schackleton, Arthur Golding, Thomas Twine, John Philippes, Robert Gittins, and John Grafton, as well as Fleming's own account. Published by Henry Denham on 27 June 1580, Fleming's pamphlet was titled: A Bright Burning Beacon, forewarning all wise Virgins to trim their lampes against the coming of the Bridegroome.

The belfry of Notre Dame de Lorette and several buildings at Lille collapsed. Stones fell from buildings in Arras, Douai, B√©thune and Rouen. Windows cracked in the cathedral of Notre Dame at Pontoise, and blocks of stone dropped ominously from the vaulting. At Beauvais, the bells rang as though sounding the tocsin. Many deaths were reported from Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. In Flanders, chimneys fell and cracks opened in the walls of Ghent and Oudenarde, killing several people. Peasants in the fields reported a low rumble and saw the ground roll in waves. On the English coast, sections of wall fell in Dover and a landslip opened a raw new piece of the White Cliffs. At Sandwich a loud noise emanated from the Channel, as church arches cracked and the gable end of a transept fell at St Peter's Church. Near Hythe, Kent, Saltwood Castle‚Äîmade famous as the site where the plot was hatched in December 1170 to assassinate Thomas Becket ‚Äî was rendered uninhabitable until it was repaired in the 19th century. In London, half a dozen chimney stacks and a pinnacle on Westminster Abbey came down; two children were killed by stones falling from the roof of Christ's Church Hospital. Indeed, many Puritans blamed the emerging theatre scene of the time in London, which was seen as the work of the Devil, as a cause of the quake.Bryson, B. (2007) Shakespeare, Harper Press, London There was damage far inland, in Cambridgeshire, where stones fell from Ely Cathedral. Part of Stratford Castle in Essex collapsed. In Scotland, a local report of the quake disturbed the adolescent James VI, who was informed that it was the work of the Devil.\\"It being reported to the King that the Master of Gray his house did shake and rock in the night as with an earthquake, and the King (then 14 years old) interrogated David Ferguson, Minister of Dunfermline, what he thought it could mean, that the house alone should shake and totter, he answered, 'Sir, why should not the Devil rock his awn bairns?\\" (John Row, History of the Ki09-ouprk of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1840), quoted among excerpts in Ebenezer Henderson, The Annals of Dumferline on-line There were aftershocks. Before dawn the next morning, between 4 and 5 o'clock, further houses collapsed near Dover due to aftershocks, and a spate of further aftershocks was noticed in east Kent on 1‚Äì2 May. ==Other earthquakes in the Dover Straits== 198 years earlier there was a very similar event, the magnitude 5.8‚Äì6.0 1382 Dover Straits earthquake, with an estimated epicentre not far from that estimated for the 1580 event. Two later quakes in the Dover Strait, in 1776 and 1950, both thought to be around magnitude 4, were noted in the 1984 compilation by R.M.W. Musson, G. Neilson and P.W. Burton.Macroseismic reports on historical British earthquakes, 1984. None in this study occurred before 1727, but the same team devoted an article to the 1580 earthquake that year,\\"The 'London' earthquake of 1580 April 6\\", in Engineering Geology 20 (March 1984), pp 113‚Äì142. the classic study.

It was discovered on 29 September 2002, by Swiss astronomer Markus Griesser at the Eschenberg Observatory in Winterthur, near Z√ºrich, Switzerland. The presumed stony Florian asteroid was named after the Swiss national symbol, Helvetia. == Orbit and classification == Helvetia is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. Based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, the asteroid has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,276 days; semi- major axis of 2.3 AU). Its orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,277 days; semi-major axis of 2.3 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins 42 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken at the Palomar Observatory in September 1960. == Naming == This minor planet bears the name for Switzerland (), where the asteroid was discovered. Helvetia is also an allegorical figure and symbol for the nation (national personification). Each Swiss stamp carries her name, and her figure appears on most Swiss coins. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 19 February 2006 (). == Physical characteristics == Helvetia is an assumed, stony S-type asteroid, the most common type in the inner main-belt and the Flora family's overall spectral type.  Lightcurve  In April 2014, Helvetia was photometrically observed by Hungarian astronomers Gyula M. Szab√≥ and Kriszti√°n S√°rneczky. However, no rotational lightcurve could be obtained. As of 2019, the asteroid's rotation period and shape still remain unknown.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Helvetia measures 2.2 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.23, which is typical for stony asteroids. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of its family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 2.06 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.6. == References  External links == * Eschenberg Observatory ‚Äì website * Discovery image with HIP 4703 (brightest star) at Eschenberg Observatory (2002) * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * * 113390 Category:Discoveries by Markus Griesser (astronomer) Category:Named minor planets 20020929 ","title":"113390 Helvetia"},{"id":"5569821","text":"Chusclan is a commune in the Gard department in southern France. ==PopulationSee also== * C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages AOC *Communes of the Gard department ==References== *INSEE ==External links== * Official site Category:Communes of Gard ","title":"Chusclan"},{"id":"5569825","text":"Kujawiak W≈Çoc≈Çawek was a Polish football and athletics club based in W≈Çoc≈Çawek, Poland.

As a result of these false charges, a number of Jews were burnt at the stake at a place later called Judenberg.Encyclopaedia Judaica, Jerusalem, 1971, Vol 8, pg 1042-43. It is also mentioned in German chronicles in 1292. It is presumed to date from earlier in the 13th century. The architecture of the building is now largely composed of comparatively modern restoration work which took place in the late 19th century and in the post-war period. The church was originally a Roman Catholic church, but has been a Lutheran Protestant church since the Protestant Reformation and a united Protestant church since the Prussian Union of churches in 1817. ==Overview== Marienkirche is the church of the bishop of the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg- Silesian Upper Lusatia with Berlin Cathedral being under joint supervision of all the member churches of the Union of Evangelical Churches. Statue of Martin Luther Along with the Nikolaikirche, the Marienkirche is the oldest church in Berlin. The oldest parts of the church are made from granite, but most of it is built of brick, giving it its characteristic bright red appearance. This was deliberately copied in the construction of the nearby Berlin City Hall, the Rotes Rathaus. During World War II, it was heavily damaged by Allied bombs. After the war the church was in East Berlin, and in the 1950s it was restored by the East German authorities. Before World War II, the Marienkirche was in the middle of a densely populated part of the district of Mitte, and was in regular use as a parish church. After the war, this area was cleared of ruined buildings and today the church stands in the open spaces around the Alexanderplatz, and is overshadowed by the East Berlin television tower, the Fernsehturm. There is a striking statue of Martin Luther outside the church. The Marienkirche also contains the tomb of Field Marshal Otto Christoph von Sparr. Carl Hildebrand Freiherr von Canstein, the founder of the oldest Bible society of the world, the Cansteinsche Bibelanstalt, was buried here in 1719. ==Personalities== Christoph Albrecht was notably the church's organist/choirmaster from 1976 to 1992. ==ReferencesExternal links== * =Reference= Mary Mitte Mary Mitte Mary Mitte Berlin Mary Mitte Berlin Mary's Mitte ","title":"St. Mary's Church, Berlin"},{"id":"5569845","text":"The 1994 UEFA Champions League Final was a football match between Italian club Milan and Spanish club Barcelona, played on 18 May 1994 at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, Greece. Barcelona were favourites to win their second European Cup/UEFA Champions League in three years, having just won La Liga for the fourth year in a row. Milan's preparation before the final was in disarray: legendary striker Marco van Basten was still out with a long-term injury, and ¬£13 million young sensation Gianluigi Lentini (then world's most expensive footballer) was also injured; sweeper and captain, Franco Baresi was suspended, as was defender Alessandro Costacurta; and UEFA regulations at the time that limited teams to fielding a maximum of three non-nationals meant that coach Fabio Capello was forced to leave out Florin RƒÉducioiu, Jean-Pierre Papin and Brian Laudrup. On Barcelona's side, the rule saw Johan Cruyff choosing not to pick Michael Laudrup in his squad for the final which caused Capello to state after the game: \\"Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out, and that was his mistake\\".ABC(spanish newspaper), 20 May 1994 Laudrup left Barcelona for their arch-rival, Real Madrid, at the end of the season. Milan played in their all-white away strip, which historically they use in finals of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, while Barcelona played in their red and blue strip. Milan dominated early and were rewarded when Dejan Saviƒáeviƒá ran down the right flank and passed to Daniele Massaro, who tapped the ball into an empty net. Massaro banged in his second just before half-time to make it 2‚Äì0 after a solo run by Roberto Donadoni down the left wing. In the 47th minute, Saviƒáeviƒá capitalised on a defensive error by Miguel √Ångel Nadal to lob goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta for the third goal. Eight minutes later, after Saviƒáeviƒá had hit a post and the Barcelona defence had failed to clear, Milan defender Marcel Desailly beat the offside trap to make it 4‚Äì0, which ended up being the final score. Many pundits have described Milan's performance against Barcelona in the final as the greatest ever by a team in European Cup/UEFA Champions League history. Desailly became the first player to win the trophy in consecutive years with different clubs after winning with Marseille in 1993. ==Teams== In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era. {  !Team !Previous final appearances (bold indicates winners) -  Milan 6 (1958, 1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1993) -  Barcelona 3 (1961, 1986, 1992) } ==Road to the final== {  center;\\" - !colspan=4 Milan !Round !colspan=4 Barcelona - bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg  Opponent Agg. 1st leg 2nd leg - align=left FC Aarau 1‚Äì0 1‚Äì0 (A) 0‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=\\"#c1e0ff\\"First round align=left Dynamo Kyiv 5‚Äì4 1‚Äì3 (A) 4‚Äì1 (H) - align=left Copenhagen 7‚Äì0 6‚Äì0 (A) 1‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffSecond round align=left Austria Wien 5‚Äì1 3‚Äì0 (H) 2‚Äì1 (A) - bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent colspan=3Result Group stage Opponent colspan=3Result - align=left Anderlecht colspan=30‚Äì0 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 1 align=left Galatasaray colspan=30‚Äì0 (A) - align=left Porto colspan=33‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 2 align=left Monaco colspan=32‚Äì0 (H) - align=left Werder Bremen colspan=32‚Äì1 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 3 align=left Spartak Moscow colspan=32‚Äì2 (A) - align=left Werder Bremen colspan=31‚Äì1 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 4 align=left Spartak Moscow colspan=35‚Äì1 (H) - align=left Anderlecht colspan=30‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 5 align=left Galatasaray colspan=33‚Äì0 (H) - align=left Porto colspan=30‚Äì0 (A) bgcolor=#c1e0ffMatchday 6 align=left Monaco colspan=31‚Äì0 (A) - colspan=4 align=center valign=topGroup B winner bgcolor=#c1e0ffFinal standings colspan=4 align=center valign=topGroup A winner - bgcolor=#c1e0ff Opponent colspan=3Result Knockout phase Opponent colspan=3Result - align=left Monaco colspan=33‚Äì0 (H) bgcolor=#c1e0ffSemi-finals align=left Porto colspan=33‚Äì0 (H) } ==Match== Details { width=92% -   } { width=100% valign=top width=50% { style=font-size:90% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Sebastiano Rossi - RB 2  Mauro Tassotti (c)  - LB 3  Christian Panucci  - CM 4  Demetrio Albertini  - CB 5  Filippo Galli - CB 6  Paolo Maldini   - LM 7  Roberto Donadoni - CM 8  Marcel Desailly - RM 9  Zvonimir Boban - CF 10 Dejan Saviƒáeviƒá - CF 11 Daniele Massaro  - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 12 Mario Ielpo - DF 13 Stefano Nava   - MF 14 Angelo Carbone - MF 15 Gianluigi Lentini - FW 16 Marco Simone - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Fabio Capello } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Andoni Zubizarreta - RB 2  Albert Ferrer  - CM 3  Pep Guardiola - CB 4  Ronald Koeman - CB 5  Miguel √Ångel Nadal  - CM 6  Jos√© Mari Bakero (c)  - LB 7  Sergi   - RW 8  Hristo Stoichkov  - CM 9  Guillermo Amor - CF 10 Rom√°rio - LW 11 Txiki Begiristain   - colspan=3Substitutes: - DF 12 Juan Carlos - GK 13 Carles Busquets - MF 14 Eusebio   - MF 15 Jon Andoni Goikoetxea - MF 16 Quique Estebaranz   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Johan Cruyff } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Assistant referees: Rob Harris (England) Roy Pearson (England) Fourth official: Martin Bodenham (England) } ==See also== *1989 European Super Cup ‚Äì contested between same teams *A.C.

The reason why the concept is important in the context of the Dynamic Energy Budget theory is that food (substrate) uptake is proportional to surface area, and maintenance to volume. The surface area that is of importance is that part that is involved in substrate uptake. Biofilms on a flat solid substrate are examples of V0-morphs; they grow in thickness, but not in surface area that is involved in nutrient exchange. Other examples are dinophyta and diatoms that have a cell wall that does not change during the cell cycle. During cell-growth, when the amounts of protein and carbohydrates increase, the vacuole shrinks. The outer membrane that is involved in nutrient uptake remains constant. At cell division, the daughter cells rapidly take up water, complete a new cell wall and the cycle repeats. Rods (bacteria that have the shape of a rod and grow in length, but not in diameter) are a static mixture between a V0- and a V1-morph, where the caps act as V0-morphs and the cylinder between the caps as V1-morph.The mixture is called static because the weight coefficients of the contributions of the V0- and V1-morph terms in the shape correction function are constant during growth. Crusts, such as lichens that grow on a solid substrate, are a dynamic mixture between a V0- and a V1-morph, where the inner part acts as V0-morph, and the outer annulus as V1-morph.The mixture is called dynamic because the weight coefficients of the contributions of the V0- and V1-morph terms in the shape correction function change during growth.The Dynamic Energy Budget theory explains why the diameter of crusts grow linearly in time at constant substrate availability. ==ReferencesSee also== * Dynamic energy budget * isomorph * V1-morph * shape correction function Category:Developmental biology Category:Metabolism ","title":"V0-morph"},{"id":"5569861","text":"La Voix du Nord (; lit. The Voice of the North or The Voice of Nord) is a regional daily newspaper from the north of France. Its headquarters are in Lille. ==History== Voix du Nord was one of the underground newspapers of the French Resistance founded in German-occupied France during World War II. The paper first appeared in Lille in April 1941 at a time when the region of Nord- Pas-de-Calais was being ruled by a German military government in Brussels. The newspaper's tag-line described itself as the \\"Resistance organ of French Flanders.\\" The post-war version of the paper is part of the Belgian company, Rossel group, which also owns the major Belgian newspaper Le Soir, which it bought from Socpresse in 2006.  Origins in Occupied France  The edition of 1 April 1942 at the is a clandestine newspaper that gave rise to a movement of political resistance. The resistance group was called Voix du Nord (\\"Voice of the North\\"‚Äîof France, or, \\"Voice of the Nord\\"‚Äîa French department). Sixty- five copies of the first issue of the newspaper were printed, dated April 1941. It clearly announced the newspaper's mission statement: The newspaper affirmed its support for General de Gaulle and its opposition to the Vichy government. At the outset, they were two very different men: Jules Noutour, police brigadier, trade unionist, and socialist member of the SFIO party; joined by , . Dumez was the heart and soul of the editorial staff: she was primarily responsible for the four hundred articles that appeared in the first 39 issues. Noutour was arrested on 8 September 1943 and deported to Gross Rosen, where he died 1 February 1945. From the four Roneotyped pages of the first day, the newspaper rapidly grew to six, and then ten pages. Due to the difficulties in obtaining supplies of paper, the page count was later reduced to four pages in February 1943. Circulation was around 900 copies initially, growing to 15000 in January 1943. The paper came out every two weeks through September 1942, and monthly from 1943 on. The last two issues were published in July and August 1944 under the responsibility of Jules Houcke, who published the first openly distributed issue of \\"La Voix du Nord\\" on September 5, 1944. The first page is crossed out, with a headline spanning six columns: \\"The Northern Region is free. Freedom and independence were purchased at a high price: prison, torture, death camps for more than 530 people, who wrote, printed, and distributed these newspapers.\\"  Modern  After the war, the paper was reborn as a hybrid partnership and limited liability company \\"La Voix du Nord - Houcke and Company\\". They took over the premises of the , and as was the habit elsewhere in France, they kept the staff on as well, and it was they who produced the former newspaper of the Resistance. For the original journalists who were actually part of the Resistance and notably the two co- founders who had not yet returned from deportation abroad in February of 1945, it was a betrayal by pseudo-Resistance members.La Voix du Nord, impostures, arnaques et profits [Shams, Scams, and Profits] (labrique.net). The shares of the new company rose in 1945, the original owners and members were priced out, and it took thirty years of litigation before they achieved success. In the 1950s, the paper started printing various local editions, giving it a regional coverage. Voix du Nord is published in tabloid. The paper sponsors the Grand Prix de Fourmies bicycle race. ==Circulation== {  - ! Year !!

Some graduate programs in the United States recommend taking this exam, while others require this exam score as a part of the application to their graduate programs. ETS sends a bulletin with a sample practice test to each candidate after registration for the exam. There are 180 questions within the biochemistry subject test. Scores are scaled and then reported as a number between 200 and 990; however, in recent versions of the test, the maximum and minimum reported scores have been 760 (corresponding to the 99 percentile) and 320 (1 percentile) respectively.

He was born in Sacramento, California. == Biography == Harry Fonseca was of Nisenan Maidu, Hawaiian, and Portuguese heritage. He studied art at California State University Sacramento with Native-American artist Frank LaPena but quit the program to pursue his own vision of art. His earliest pieces drew from his Maidu heritage. He was influenced by basketry designs, dance regalia, and by his participation as a traditional dancer. Further, the creation of his people, as recounted by his uncle, Henry Azbill, became the source of a major 1977 work, Creation Story, which he would paint in many versions during his career. Fonseca began his popular Coyote series in 1979. In it he places Coyote, who can be seen as the trickster, shapeshifter, or wise one, in non-traditional settings. As an example, his Coyote in the Mission depicts Coyote dressed in a leather jacket with many zippers and green hightop sneakers standing against a graffiti covered brick wall in San Francisco's Mission district. Another image has Rousseauesque Coyote sitting in a Paris cafe. In 1981 he illustrated a book, Legends of the Yosemite Miwok, compiled by Frank LaPena and Craig Bates. Fonseca was particularly taken by petroglyphs in the Coso Range near Owens Lake, California, and petroglyphs from throughout the Southwest United States. In 1991 he reinterprets the Maidu Creation myth all over again using imagery influenced by petroglyphs. He began a series of paintings he called Stone Poems, that draw heavily from these petroglyphs. A series of these paintings were exhibited in the Southwest Museum (Los Angeles, California) in 1989. Harry found another profound influence in the California Gold Rush, where his work takes a political tone. These are small abstract paintings in which gold is the predominant color, along with traces of red which represent the blood of Native Americans shed by the gold seekers. Each painting also incorporates minerals from California's gold country. Fonseca wrote that they are \\"a direct reference to the physical, emotional and spiritual genocide of the native people of California\\". Many of these were exhibited in the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento (1992) and the Oakland Museum as part of a larger Gold Rush exhibit in 1998. He did many drawings and prints of Coyote and Rose, a female counterpart to Coyote, often depicted in a rose print dress. These became a mainstay of Santa Fe event posters. Harry did several other series of paintings. One series painted in the 1990s was of images of Saint Francis, who appears as negative space in each painting. About the same time he did a series of paintings of the Icarus story. Another series from 2002 was inspired by the striped patterns on early Navajo blankets. From the early 1990s on he lived in and maintained a studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 2003 he started to paint a series of abstract paintings of flowering tree branches, which he called collectively the Four Seasons, a small group of which were exhibited at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in New York City. He was diagnosed with brain cancer and hospitalized in the Veterans Administration hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico in August, 2006 where he died on December 28, 2006. The Albuquerque Museum (Albuquerque, New Mexico), the California State Parks Central Valley Regional Indian Museum (Sacramento, California), Crocker Art Museum (Sacramento, California), the Denver Art Museum, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians & Western Art (Indianapolis, Indiana), Ethnological Museum of Berlin (Berlin), the Heard Museum (Phoenix, Arizona), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Hood Museum of Art (Dartmouth College, New Hampshire), the Linden Museum (Stuttgart, Germany), the Monterey Fine Arts Museum (Monterey, California), the New Mexico Museum of Fine Art (Santa Fe, New Mexico), the Oakland Museum of California (Oakland, California), Oguni Museum (Oguni, Japan), the Pequot Museum (Mashantucket, Connecticut), the University Art Museum (Berkeley, California), the Washington State Arts Museum (Olympia, Washington), and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian (Santa Fe, New Mexico) are among the public collections holding work by Harry Fonseca. ==References== * Official website with Biography, Exhibition History, and Sample Images * Discovery of Gold In California Paintings * Harry Fonseca's \\"Koshares with Cotton Candy\\" * \\"A Time of Visions\\" - an interview with Larry Abbott * Abby Wasserman article on Harry from 1987 Category:Native American painters Category:1946 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Maidu Category:Artists from Sacramento, California Category:American people of Portuguese descent Category:American people of Native Hawaiian descent Category:California State University, Sacramento alumni Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:Deaths from cancer in New Mexico Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters ","title":"Harry Fonseca"},{"id":"5569932","text":"Wayang wong, also known as wayang orang (literally \\"human wayang\\"), is a type of classical Javanese dance theatrical performance with themes taken from episodes of the Ramayana or Mahabharata. Performances are stylised, reflecting Javanese court culture: Despite being closely associated with Javanese tradition, variants of wayang wong dance drama can also be found in neighboring ethnic traditions, including in Balinese and Sundanese traditions. ==History== The bas relief panels on the 9th-century Prambanan temple show episodes of the Ramayana epic. The adaptation of Mahabharata episodes has been integrated in the Javanese literature tradition since the Kahuripan and Kediri era, with notable examples such as Arjunawiwaha, composed by Mpu Kanwa in the 11th century. The Penataran temple in East Java depicts themes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata in its bas reliefs. The Javanese dance drama associated with wayangs epic themes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata would have existed by then. Wayang in Kawi (Old Javanese) means \\"shadow\\" and wong means \\"human\\". Wayang wang was a performance in the style of wayang kulit (the shadow theatre of Central Java) wherein actors and actresses took the puppets' roles. The first written reference to the form is on the stone inscription Wimalarama from East Java dated 930 CE.Soedarsono, l997: 4-6 The genre is currently done in masked and unmasked variations in Central Java, Bali, and Cirebon, as well as in Sunda (West Java). Wayang wong is closely associated with Javanese culture. Originally, it was performed only as an aristocratic entertainment in four palaces of Yogyakarta, Pakualaman, Surakarta and Mangkunegaran. In the course of time, it spread to become a popular and folk form as well. Javanese wayang wong performances are regularly staged in Trimurti Ramayana open air stage in Prambanan temple compound as Ramayana Ballet, Purawisata cultural hall in Yogyakarta, Sriwedari park in Solo, and also Ngesti Pandawa in Semarang. ==Variations== Other than in the Javanese dance tradition, the variants of wayang wong dance drama can also be found in other traditions, including in Balinese and Sundanese traditions. Wayang wong Bali Balinese wayang wong Ramayana, performed in Sarasvati Garden in Ubud Wayang wong Bali refers to a Balinese version of wayang dance drama. Its contemporary presentation is usually included within the kecak dance, where fragments or episodes of the Ramayana are performed amidst the chanting kecak dancers. However, a Balinese wayang wong version that does not include kecak dancers has also existed, especially in Ubud. Wayang wong Bali is usually associated with Buleleng District. Wayang wong Cirebon Wayang wong Cirebon refers to a tradition of wayang dance drama in the city of Cirebon, West Java. Cirebon has two styles of wayang wong. The first is a commoners or village version in which the performers are masked. The second is a Cirebon palace variant where the performers dance are unmasked. Cirebonese wayang wong developed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and influenced the wayang wong Priangan by the end of that century. Wayang wong Priangan Wayang wong Priangan refers to a Sundanese version of wayang dance drama, developed in the Priangan region in the heartland of West Java. Wayang wong Priangan developed in the late nineteenth century, peaked in the regencies of Bandung, Sumedang, Garut and Sukabumi in the period before World War II, and receded by the late 1960s as audiences waned. In the Sundanese tradition, the most prevalent wayang tradition is wayang golek, a wooden rod puppet performance. Nevertheless, the wayang-themed dance drama performance also exists, usually performed in Sundanese sandiwara traditional drama form. Wayang gedog Wayang gedog, masked wayang in Surabaya c. 1905 Wayang gedog (lit. \\"masked wayang\\"), another form of wayang wong performance, is usually considered to be a cross between wayang wong and the topeng dance. These performances take themes from the Panji cycle stories about the kingdom of Janggala. Players wear masks known as wayang topeng or wayang gedog. The word gedog comes from kedok, which like topeng means \\"mask\\". The main theme is a love story about Princess Candra Kirana of Kediri and Raden Panji Asmarabangun, the crown prince of Janggala. Candra Kirana was the incarnation of Dewi Ratih (the Hindu goddess of love) and Panji was an incarnation of Kamajaya (the Hindu god of love). Candra Kirana's story has been given the title \\"Smaradahana\\" (\\"The fire of love\\"). At the end of the complicated story they finally marry and produce a son. Panji Asmarabangun ruled Janggala under the official names of \\"Sri Kameswara\\", \\"Prabu Suryowiseso\\", and \\"Hino Kertapati\\". == Dance style == Wayang wong has fixed patterns of movement and costume: For male performers: * Alus: very slow, elegant and smooth movement. For example, the dance of Arjuna, Puntadewa and all other refined and slimly built kshatriyas. There are two types of movement, lanyap and luruh. * Gagah: a more masculine and powerful dance movement, used commonly for the roles of strongly built kshatriyas, soldiers and generals. ** Kambeng: a more powerful and athletic dance, used for the roles of Bima, Antareja, and Ghatotkacha. ** Bapang: gagah and kasar for the warriors of antagonist roles such as Kaurawa. ** Kalang kinantang: falls somewhere between alus and gagah, danced by tall, slim dancers in the roles of Kresno or Suteja. * Kasar: a coarse style, used in portraying evil characters such as Rakshasa, ogres and demons. * Gecul: a funny court jester and commoners, portraying ponokawan and cantrik. ** Kambeng dengklik: for ape warriors, such as Hanuman. ** Kalang kinantang dengklik: for ape warriors, such as Sugriwa and Subali. For female performers: The movements known as nggruda or ngenceng encot in the classical high style of dance consist of nine basic movements (joged pokok) and twelve other movements (joged gubahan and joged wirogo) and are used in performing the bedoyo and srimpi. Today, the wayang wong, following the Gagrak style of Surakarta, is danced by women. They follow the alus movements associated with a kshatriya, resembling Arjuna. In the Gagkra style from Yogyakarta, a male dancer uses these same alus movements to depict princes and generals. There are about 45 distinct character types. ==Performances== Pandava and Krishna in an act of the wayang wong performance Performances of wayang wong are regularly staged in the Javanese cultural heartlands, the court cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo). The national capital Jakarta also stages wayang wong performances, although they are not always well-publicised. Yogyakarta A series of well-known dramatic monthly evening performances of wayang wong from the Ramayana is performed all year round at the Prambanan temple near Yogyakarta. The most complete Ramayana wayang wong involving more than a hundred dancers, artists and gamelan musicians is performed only during the dry season (usually May to October) on a large, open-air stage with the Prambanan Trimurti temples as the background. During the monsoon rainy season, however, the performance is moved into a smaller indoor theatre nearby. In downtown Yogyakarta, on the eastern side of Keraton Yogyakarta, the Ramayana wayang wong is also performed every night, starting at 8 p.m. at Purawisata theatre, Jalan Brigjen Katamso, Yogyakarta. Surakarta Episodes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana are often performed daily in the Wayang Orang Sriwedari theatre in Sriwedari Cultural Park at Jalan Slamet Riyadi 275, Surakarta city, in Central Java. This daily performance starts at 8.15 p.m. every night, except on Sundays. Jakarta In Jakarta the Wayang Orang Bharata group, one of the oldest wayang orang groups existing in Jakarta, generally stages performances in the Bharata Theatre just north of Pasar Senen near the centre of the city each Saturday night.Edna Tarigan, \\"The surviving human puppet show\\", The Jakarta Post Travel, 24 March 2014. See also Maria Yuniar, \\"My Jakarta: Widjarno, Wayang Orang Dancer\\", The Jakarta Globe, 13 October 2010. The Bharata Theatre, which seats around 300 people, was renovated with funds from the Jakarta city government in the early 2000s.Ani Suswantoro, \\"Wayang Wong Bharata survives on love, devotion\\", The Jakarta Post, 9 March 2008. The performances are often based around stories of conflict between clans drawn from the Mahabharata. Presentations involve traditional Javanese dancing, stylised fighting, and periods of dialogue, accompanied by music from a substantial gamelan orchestra.Novia Stephani, \\"Wyang Orang Star Enjoys Her Second Act\\", The Jakarta Post, 24 January 2012. Actors representing the well-known Punokawan clowns, including the much-loved Semar, usually involve themselves in the action, often poking considerable fun at the self-important lives that the princes and high-born warriors lead.Ani Suswantoro, \\"The story of 'Gatutkaca Luweng'\\", The Jakarta Post, 9 March 2008. Ticket prices are relatively modest, with even the best seats in the Bharata Theatre generally costing (early 2013) less than $US 10 per person. Other than the weekly wayang wong performances of Bharata in the Senen area, Jakarta has sometimes staged special annual wayang orang performances in Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru in Central Jakarta, Taman Ismail Marzuki, or in Gedung Pewayangan Kautaman, near Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. These are not routine performances; schedules should be inquired about in advance at those theatres. There are several wayang wong troupes in Jakarta, such as Swargaloka, Senawangi, Puspobudoyo and Sekar Budaya Nusantara. Television Wayang wong performances are sometimes aired on television, such as on TVRI and World of Wayang on Kompas TV. ==See also== * Wayang * Ramayana Ballet ==References== Category:Wayang Category:Javanese culture Category:Theatre in Indonesia Category:Traditional drama and theatre of Indonesia Category:Dances of Indonesia Category:Dances of Java ","title":"Wayang wong"},{"id":"5569933","text":"thumb The Dan Band is a comedy band created by actor/comedian Dan Finnerty.

Caswell Bay or Welsh Bae Cas-wellt (meaning straw fortress), is a beach on the south east of the Gower Peninsula, Swansea, Wales. It is a sandy beach popular with families, holiday makers and surfers, and it regularly achieves Blue Flag status. ==Facilities and access== There is good access to Caswell Bay by car and public transport by First Cymru from Swansea Bus Station. There is a large pay and display car park and buses go to the nearby village of Oystermouth and the Mumbles. To the east is a well maintained coastal path leading to the neighbouring Langland Bay. To the west is a more rural path leading to Brandy Cove and Pwlldu Bay. Caswell Bay has two cafes, which open all year round, and a beach shop. The Surfside Cafe suffered severe storm damage in January and February 2014, but reopened in the spring following repair and refurbishment. There are also public toilets and outdoor public showers. Swansea City Council operate a Lifeguard service 7 days a week from early May to the beginning of September. The bay is a popular surfing location and is home to a surf school offering lessons all year round. It is also a renowned rock pooling location. The Bishop's Wood nature reserve sits behind the bay, a rare example of a limestone woodland. The nature reserve is open to the public for unaccompanied visits at any time. Educational tours can be arranged through the Bishop's Wood countryside centre. ==History== Baxter, 1818 Between 1829 and 1840 much of the land around Caswell Bay was bought by John James, a former Curate of Bishopston, for his daughter and his son-in-law, Charles Morgan.Morgan, P. (1981) Caswell - The Making of a Landscape. Gower journal of the Gower Society, Vol.32 (1981), pp. 6‚Äì10. In 1846, The Morgans sold a piece of land on the eastern side of the bay to 19th Century pioneer photographer John Dillwyn Llewelyn who was a regular visitor to the bay. Llewelyn built a holiday home, Caswell Cottage, which stood until around 1960 on the site of what is now the Caswell Bay public car park.Gabb, G. (2000) The Dillwyn family in Mumbles. Gower journal of the Gower Society, Vol. 51, (2000), p. 20-30. In 1854 images of two of his photographs of Caswell Bay were requested by Prince Albert. In August 1878 Llewelyn's thirteen-year-old grandson drowned whilst swimming in the bay, with the inquest held at the Caswell Bay Hotel. Caswell Cottage. The holiday home of John Dillwyn Llewelyn and his family Frances Ridley Havergal's memorial plaque near Caswell Bay After the death of Mrs Charles Morgan in 1877, her Caswell Estate was divided amongst her six children. Soon afterwards, a portion of the land on the western side of the bay was sold to the Davenport family who built a large house on the land. The house was called Redcliffe, named after Redley Cliff which bounds the western side of the bay. In the late 1920s Redcliffe was the family home of poet Vernon Watkins, a contemporary and close friend of Dylan Thomas. The house stood until the 1960s when it was demolished to make way for the Redcliffe apartments that now overlook the west side of the bay. The three daughters of Mrs Charles Morgan, Emma, Agnes and Alice made Caswell Bay their home from 1877 and built many of the houses which remain to this day, including their own home, Bay House which stands above the centre of the bay. The sisters also planted many of the bay's distinctive pine trees. In 1879, the religious poet and hymn writer Frances Ridley Havergal died of peritonitis in a house near Caswell Bay. A memorial plaque commemorates this. In 1883 a wind pump was built at the peak of Redley Cliff to pump water to nearby houses. The wind pump was badly damaged in a gale less than five years later and had ceased to be used by 1900. It remained a landmark until it was destroyed for safety reasons in 1930 having been badly damaged in a suspicious fire. On top of Redley Cliff there is also evidence of the existence of a defended Iron Age enclosure. In the 1890s a large concrete water tank was built at the base of the cliff, which remains to this day. The water tank was used to collect water from a small spring during the late 19th century. Around the same time a pump house was built on the eastern side of the bay. The sea soon smashed it and a replacement was built near the road consisting of two buildings built a short time apart. By the end of World War I the pump house was no longer required and for a time it was used as a caf√©. The newer of the two buildings remains to this day alongside the base of the older building. For more than forty years in the 20th century, Caswell Bay played a central role in a murder mystery. Less than 2 years after settling in a house overlooking Caswell Bay, George Shotton and his wife Mamie Stuart mysteriously disappeared before Christmas 1919. When police tracked down Shotton in 1920 they feared he had murdered Mamie Stuart, but were unable to find the evidence. On 5 November 1961 a sack of human bones was found in a disused mine at the nearby Brandy Cove. A coroner‚Äôs inquest determined the remains were those of the missing Mamie Stuart. After an extensive manhunt George Shotton was traced to a cemetery in Bristol, having died just 3 years earlier. On the cliff top above the centre of the bay are the Caswell Bay Court apartments which were built in the 1990s on the site previously occupied by the Caswell Bay Hotel. The hotel was expanded from a simple Victorian villa built in the 1850s. In 2006 Caswell Bay was named as one of the top 50 beaches in the UK by The Guardian newspaper. ==ReferencesExternal links== * surfing school at Caswell Bay * www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Caswell Bay and surrounding area * Surfing and beach pictures of Caswell bay, Mumbles, Swansea Category:Bays of the Gower Peninsula Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in West Glamorgan Category:Tourist attractions in Swansea ","title":"Caswell Bay"},{"id":"5570066","text":"Denio is a census-designated place (CDP) in Humboldt County, Nevada, along the Oregon state line in the United States.

The population of the CDP, which is entirely in Nevada, was 47 at the 2010 census; additional development considered to be Denio extends into Oregon. The CDP includes a post office, a community center, a library, and the Diamond Inn Bar, the center of the town's social life. Recreational activities in the Denio area include bird watching, photography, off road vehicle use, fishing, recreational black opal mining, rockhounding, hunting, visiting the hot springs, and camping on the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge. Denio Junction is about south of Denio, at the junction of State Route 140 and State Route 292. Denio Junction's motel provides gas, food, groceries, and lodging. Denio Junction Airport is a two- runway graded airstrip. There is no scheduled air or ground transportation serving this field, which is a short walk from Denio Junction. ==History== Denio was named after Aaron Denio, who settled in the area in 1885. He was born in 1824 in Illinois and traveled to California in 1860. He worked in milling, mining, and farming in Nevada and California for 25 years before settling near the Oregon-Nevada border. He died at Denio in 1907. The Denio post office was established in Oregon in 1888. After World War II a number of businesses relocated south of the state line to take advantage of Nevada's lack of an income tax and more liberal liquor, gambling, and prostitution laws. The post office was moved and reopened in Nevada in 1950 for Nevada addresses, not Oregon.

The town started as an underground lode mining venture, which continued up to 1935. Surface mining with earth moving equipment lasted until 1940. In 1950 placer mining was done, with a dry land washing plant operating until 1957. Much hydraulic mining was done. Total district production was over $8 million. Some people still lived there in 1965 to 1969.Stanley Paher, Nevada Ghost Towns and Mining Camps, p. 367-372 Gold was discovered at Round Mountain in 1905, but it was not until the following year that more substantial discoveries aroused interest in the area. High-grade gold ore was discovered on a hill known as Round Mountain. By mid-year, the population was close to 400. A number of major mining companies became active in the area and soon the town was given the name of Round Mountain. By 1907, there were daily stages running from Round Mountain to Tonopah. The town contained many wood structures containing mercantiles, saloons, brokerage agencies, a school and a library. In 1906, the first two mining companies to begin operations were the Round Mountain Mining Company and the Fairview Round Mountain Mines Company. The value of the ore produced by the Round Mountain Company during the first ten years (1906 to 1916) was a little over $3 million. By the beginning of 1909 there were six mills operating in the district. Businesses included hotels, general stores, banks, restaurants, lodging houses, a school, a library, and a hospital. By 1939 the town's population was still only 234. The value of total production through 1940 was $7.8 million. New surface operations on the side of Round Mountain began in 1970 and continue to this day. Historic school The Round Mountain School was built in 1936 with two teachers and children from first through twelfth grade housed within its walls. The school was used until the mid-1990s, when Karl W.

The two physicians have many of the same views scientifically, but are philosophically a mismatch because of Drager's atheism and Jansen's Christianity. After being married to his sweetheart Els (Gena Rowlands), Drager must trek into the jungle to track down Frolick (Philip Abbott), a drunken river master who is lost. Frolick has been driven mad by a shaman called Burubi (Reggie Nalder). Drager eventually comes across Frolick, but ends up killing him in self-defense. After rescuing another doctor, in the same region, Anton becomes lost in the wild. He nearly dies and has lapsed into a coma by the time he is rescued.

It is dedicated to oboist Joy Boughton, daughter of Benjamin Britten's friend and fellow composer Rutland Boughton, who gave the first performance at the Aldeburgh Festival on 14 June 1951. ==Structure== Each of the six sections is based on a character from Roman mythology who is briefly described: # Pan, \\"who played upon the reed pipe which was Syrinx, his beloved.\\" # Phaeton, \\"who rode upon the chariot of the sun for one day and was hurled into the river Padus by a thunderbolt.\\" # Niobe, \\"who, lamenting the death of her fourteen children, was turned into a mountain.\\" # Bacchus, \\"at whose feasts is heard the noise of gaggling women's tattling tongues and shouting out of boys.\\" # Narcissus, \\"who fell in love with his own image and became a flower.\\" # Arethusa, \\"who, flying from the love of Alpheus the river god, was turned into a fountain.\\" The piece is between 10 and 15 minutes in length. ==Music== The music of the first metamorphosis echoes the \\"free-spirited\\" character of its titular figure: it is unmeasured and includes frequent pauses. This contrasts with the second metamorphosis, a quick and rhythmic representation of the chariot ride of Phaeton, marked vivace ritmico. The third is slower and is marked piangendo, or \\"crying\\". The four-part fourth metamorphosis reflects the atmosphere of a drunken feast or festival. The fifth, marked lento piacevole, is meant to convey the act of staring at a reflection in a pool.

They are depicted as a beast with clawed hands and a very hairy face covered with dark clouds, but its full body appearance is unknown. In its opened mouth is a big tongue. It is drawn as a beast with clawed hands and a hairy face, with most of its body hidden in a black cloud over a floodgate. It is characterized by its open mouth and large tongue. Sekien did not attach an explanatory note about this y≈çkai, but its origins are identifiable as Akaguchi which appears in older Edo period y≈çkai scrolls such as Bakemono no e. This y≈çkai is known interchangeably as Akaguchi and Akashita. ==Origin theory== Usually, they are not depicted accompanied with anything other than a black cloud, but in the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç by Toriyama Sekien, they are depicted on top of a sluice. However, there is no accompanying explanation, so details about it are unknown. Concerning the name \\"akashita\\", the modern literary scholar Atsunobu Inada among others suggest that they are related to the shakuzetsujin (Ëµ§ËàåÁ•û) and shakuzetsunichi (Ëµ§ËàåÊó•), who protect the western gate of Tai Sui (Jupiter) as explained by onmy≈çd≈ç. In the Edo Period e-sugoroku, the Jikkai Sugoroku (at the National Diet Library) and the emakimono Hyakki Yagy≈ç Emaki (Oda G≈çch≈ç, 1832), they are depicted by the name \\"akashita\\", but in depictions closer to the later mentioned \\"Akaguchi\\", it is depicted differently from Sekien's picture, and there is no depiction of a sluice. Concerning how the there is a sluice depicted in the picture in the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç by Toriyama Sekien, the y≈çkai researcher Katsumi Tada and y≈çkai journalist Kenji Murakami posit that this is one kind of picture explanation by Sekien. According to them, the \\"aka\\" (red) can be understood as \\"aka\\" (Ê∑¶, bilge water, the water that collects on the bottom of ships) and \\"aka\\" (Âû¢, filth), so it is a metaphor for dirtiness, and the \\"shita\\" (tongue) can be understood as \\"shita\\" (‰∏ã, down, in this case meaning the depths of one's mind), so it can be understood as the popular saying \\"the tongue (shita) is the gate to calamities\\", so the akashita is a type of rasetsu god, so the picture is likely saying that as long as one's mouth is open, one will never be blessed with good fortune. ==Akaguchi== Akaguchi (Akashita), bakemono no e, Brigham Young University \\"Akaguchi\\" („ÅÇ„ÅãÂè£) from the Hyakkai Zukan by Sawaki Suushi In the Edo Period y≈çkai emaki Hyakkai Zukan (Sawaki Suushi, 1737), the Bakemonozukushi (author and year unknown, held by Kagaya Rei), the Bakemono Emaki (author and year unknown, at the Kawasaki City Museum), there is a y≈çkai depicted called the \\"akaguchi\\" (Ëµ§Âè£ or „ÅÇ„ÅãÂè£) that appears to be modeled after the \\"akashita\\" drawn by Sekien. They have a wide open red mouth (including the tongue), the clawed hands, the hairy face, which are points of commonality with the beast depicted as covered with black clouds in the Jikkai Sugoroku and the \\"akashita\\" of Sekien. They do not depict a sluice. According to the Edo Period writing Kiy≈´ Sh≈çran (Â¨âÈÅäÁ¨ëË¶ß), it can be seen that one of the y≈çkai that it notes is depicted in the Bakemono E (ÂåñÁâ©Áµµ) drawn by K≈çh≈çgen Motonobu is one by the name of \\"akaguchi.\\" Concerning \\"akaguchi\\", Katsumi Tada favors the idea that they come from the shakk≈ç/shakku (Ëµ§Âè£) of the rokuy≈ç (ÂÖ≠Êõú, a system of lucky and unlucky days). ==Expositions in the Sh≈çwa period== In literature starting from Sh≈çwa, several explanations about the akashita have come up in publications, but other than by appearance, they all appear unrelated to the one in the emakimono and by Sekien. The following is a rough summary of these. Morihiko Fujisawa's notes In the Y≈çkai Gadan Zensh≈´ Nihon Hen (Â¶ñÊÄ™ÁîªË´áÂÖ®ÈõÜ Êó•Êú¨ÁØá) (1929) by the folklore scholare Morihiko Fujisawa, besides Sekien's picture of the \\"akashita\\" published for illustration, there is the following caption: essentially stating that it washes away the fields of evildoers. This caption does not come from Sekien or any old literature, but is a Fujisawa's own original interpretation of the picture. Arifumi Sat≈ç's explanatory text In the illustrated y≈çkai references Y≈çkai Daizukan (Â¶ñÊÄ™Â§ßÂõ≥Èëë, Big Illustrated Y≈çkai Reference) (1973) and Y≈çkai Daizenka (Â¶ñÊÄ™Â§ßÂÖ®Áßë) among others by Arifumi Sat≈ç, there is the explanation that they are a y≈çkai that would stick out their tongues from the red sky on evenings and kidnap people.‰ΩêËó§ÊúâÊñá„ÄéÂ¶ñÊÄ™Â§ßÂõ≥Èëë„Äè ÈªíÂ¥éÊõ∏Â∫ó 1973Âπ¥ 156È†Å‰ΩêËó§ÊúâÊñá„ÄéÂ¶ñÊÄ™Â§ßÂÖ®Áßë„Äè ÁßãÁî∞Êõ∏Â∫ó 1980Âπ¥ 136È†Å They state that the families of those people kidnapped by an akashita would later prosper, among other things, but nothing that indicates such a legend exists can be found from Sekien or old literature. T≈çhoku Kaidan no Tabi The T≈çhoku Kaidan no Tabi (1974) by Norio Yamada writes that an akaguchi appeared at a farming village in the Tsugaru regin in the Aomori Prefecture and resolved a dispute over water for the fields. Starting in the Sh≈çwa era, the story about an akaguchi appearing in the Tsugaru region was widely used in y≈çkai illustrated references or y≈çkai themed books among other publications, and all of them refer back to this story. It is understood that the story about an akashita resolving a water dispute is based on a legend at this place of a water dispute that got resolved, but with Sekien's \\"akashita\\" later retrofitted into the story. ==Concept== Akaguchi has association with the use of water in farming country. Though some sources say Akaguchi is simply an omen of bad luck, others represent Akaguchi as a protective spirit. During droughts, water is carefully controlled and distributed equally to farmers in the area. As a form of warfare, some would siphon above the allotted amount of water for their personal fields. This was a great crime and could cost neighboring farmers their livelihood. It was believed that the perpetrators of this crime not punished by law would be punished by Akaguchi. If these criminals came near the floodgate Akaguchi would appear and swallow them, scooping them up with its giant red tongue. The name Akashita may be correlated to which guards the western gate of Jupiter. It may also be related to the , a day of bad luck in Onmy≈çd≈ç. ==References== * * Category:Y≈çkai ","title":"Akashita"},{"id":"5570135","text":"Tuscarora is an unincorporated community in Elko County, Nevada, United States.

He made his Denmark under-21 national team debut on 25 August 1992. Colding first made himself noticed on the senior level, when he scored in Frem's 1‚Äì5 defeat to Real Zaragoza in the 1992‚Äì93 UEFA Cup tournament.Harvy Hansen, \\"Frem sendt til t√¶lling af spanske Zaragoza\\", Berlingske Tidende, 4 November 1992 When Frem went bankrupt in fall 1993, Colding moved to rivals Br√∏ndby IF in the Danish Superliga championship.Ejvind Fritzb√∏ger, \\"S√∏ren Colding til Br√∏ndby\\", Ekstra Bladet, 16 December 1993 He debuted for the club in June 1994, and Colding made his debut for the Danish national team under national team coach Bo Johansson in November 1996.

Following Br√∏ndby's three Danish Superliga triumphs in a row from 1996 to 1998, and the club's qualification for the 1998‚Äì99 UEFA Champions League tournament, Colding became a mainstay in the Danish national team.

The club finished in a meriting fifth place in the 2003‚Äì04 Bundesliga season, and Colding received his final call-up to the Danish national team, when Morten Olsen included him in the team that lost 0‚Äì2 to Spain in March 2004.

Irani) (November 4, 1881 ‚Äì November 3, 1938) was an Indian lawyer and distinguished benefactor of the Zoroastrian communities of both India and Iran. == Biography == Dinshah was born on 4 November 1881 in Mumbai. His family moved from Iran to India as part of a wave of migration that began during the 18th century. His paternal grandfather, Bomes, left Yazd with his son Jijibhoy to settle in India in the mid-nineteenth century. His mother, Piroja BƒÅnu, was allegedly the granddaughter of GolestƒÅn BƒÅnu, one of the original Iranian Zoroastrian migrants of the late 18th century. In 1901, he received a bachelor's degree in English and Persian literature at the University of Mumbai‚Äôs Elphinstone College. The following year, he was appointed as a teaching fellow in Persian at St. Xavier's College in Mumbai; however, soon he abandoned his academic career. In 1904, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws and embarked on a legal career. Dinshah (also transliterated as Dinshaw) Irani is most famous for founding the 'Iranian Zoroastrian Anjuman' in 1918 and of the 'Iran League' in 1922. Both organizations, like the earlier 'Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund' established in 1854 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, were founded with the aim of improving the conditions for the less fortunate Zoroastrian co-religionists in Iran. Dinshah's efforts to improve the conditions for that community were recognized in 1932 when he - along with fellow Indian Rabindranath Tagore - was invited to Iran as a special guest of the then Shahanshah Reza Shah Pahlavi. Irani was also an academic and published numerous works including a translation of the Gathas. He was the father of Indian-American philosopher and academic Kaikhosrov D.

Weinbaum that was first published in the October 1935 issue of Astounding Stories. It is Weinbaum's third story featuring Hamilton Hammond and Patricia Burlingame, a sequel to \\"Parasite Planet\\" and \\"The Lotus Eaters\\". ==Plot summary== Following his expedition to the night side of Venus, the Smithsonian Institution appoints Hamilton \\"Ham\\" Hammond to head an expedition to Uranus. In Weinbaum's version of the Solar System, all of the gas giants generate significant amounts of infrared radiation, enough to produce Earthlike environments on the inner moons of Jupiter and Saturn and on the surface of Uranus itself. At the time \\"The Planet of Doubt\\" takes place at the turn of the 22nd century, the limited range of the spaceships ensures that Uranus can only be reached from the American base on Titan when Saturn reaches conjunction with Uranus, an event that occurs once every forty years.Weinbaum makes an astronomical error here; while there is indeed a conjunction of Uranus and Saturn in 2100, it is the wrong conjunction, placing Saturn and Uranus on the opposite sides of the Sun, instead of on the same side. The Young expedition explored the planet's south pole in 2060; now Hammond takes his ship, the Gaea, to the north pole. Finding an ocean at the north pole, Hammond sends the Gaea spiraling southeast until they reach land. They find the surface of Uranus largely barren with a few plants. The surface is shrouded in a thick fog which absorbs radio waves as well as visible light, and there is no planetary magnetic field to work a compass, so the members of the expedition, including Hammond's wife, the Venusian-born biologist Patricia Burlingame, must remain tethered to the ship to avoid getting lost. While Hammond and Burlingame explore, she starts seeing vague shapes in the fog; Hammond begins to see them too. When they receive a signal from the ship, they hurry back to find it under attack by an immensely long black creature made up of dozens of connected segments. They manage to fight it off and return to the ship. Burlingame decides that the creature is similar to the larval Thaumetopoeidae, which forms processions when it travels from its nest. She hypothesizes that the individual segments link nervous systems so that they all act in unison. As for the shapes in the fog, Burlingame thinks they are analogous to honeyguides, and that they lead the segment-creature to its prey. On their last foray from the ship, Burlingame sees a new type of flora beyond the reach of her tether. Against Hammond's orders, she frees herself from the tether to approach it. Hammond summons the ship's other two crew members, leaves a note for them at the end of the tether, then frees himself. He wanders lost for hours before accidentally coming across the tether again. He and the rest of the crew continue searching for forty hours before finally finding Burlingame resting within a segment-creature that has formed a closed loop. The other crew members boost Hammond over the segment-creature. He pulls a rope taut between him and them and Burlingame climbs across, then Hammond vaults over the moving segment-creature. Back on board the Gaea, Burlingame reveals that shortly after leaving her tether, she ran into a segment-creature which began chasing her. She had the idea of running up to the last creature in the line so that the leader would latch onto it, but inadvertently left herself inside the circle instead of outside. She also deduced that the shapes in the fog were the shadows of flying creatures, and that the segment- creatures were their larvae. ==Collections== \\"The Planet of Doubt\\" appears in the following Stanley G.

Nymeyer founded the Libertarian Press and was largely responsible for bringing the economic writings of Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk to the United States. A personal friend of Ludwig von Mises, Nymeyer was also an eager proponent of Austrian economics. His writings evidence both a commitment to free market principles and a devotion to his Dutch Calvinist faith. His most thorough work, Minimal Religion, posits the incompatibility of socialist ethics with the Christian faith. In Social Action, Hundred Nineteen, he argued forcefully against the social gospel. Progressive Calvinism, later renamed First Principles in Morality and Economics, was a periodical authored by Nymeyer. Directed primarily at an audience of Dutch Reformed youth, the publication linked Christian principles to libertarian political theory. Nymeyer's writings also touch on theological ideas. In the heated debate over Common Grace, Nymeyer sided against the official position of his denomination (Christian Reformed Church), accepting instead a position similar to that advocated by Herman Hoeksema and the Protestant Reformed Churches. ==References== * * * == External links == * Progressive Calvinism archives * Libertarian Press, Inc.

By 1890, Littlehampton had become a busy industrial area, with factories producing bricks, jam, sauces, bacon, wattle extract, a brewery and a sawmill.

His father, Rabbi Aharon Shmuel Stein, was the head of the Breinsk Beth Din and a student of Rabbi Shimon Shkop, who was the sandek at Pesach Yitzchok's bris. Stein studied at the yeshiva in Breinsk, and later at the Slonim Yeshiva under Rabbi Shabsi Yogel. In 1936 Stein went to study in the Mir Yeshiva in Poland, where he formed a close relationship with the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel. With the start of World War II, Stein fled with the Mir Yeshiva to Vilna and then to Shanghai, where he spent the remainder of the war. During this time, Stein formed a relationship with the Mashgiach, Rabbi Yechezkel Levenstein. Stein was the only member of his family who survived the Holocaust. His parents and three brothers were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. After the war, he joined the remainder of the Mir yeshiva students in New York City, where the yeshiva had re-opened. For a short period, he joined a group of students who went to Cincinnati, Ohio, where Rabbi Eliezer Silver had founded a yeshiva. In 1948, Stein married the daughter of Rabbi Zalman Bloch, who had been the menahel ruchani of the Telz Yeshiva in Lithuania. Shortly after his marriage, Stein began to deliver shiurim at the Telz Yeshiva. At the time, Rabbi Stein was the only rosh yeshiva not to have studied in Telz and so his methodology and approach to Talmudic analysis were unique to the yeshiva. In 1988, Stein's oldest son, Rabbi Shmuel Zalman, died at the age of 38. He was the author of Pri Shmuel, and delivered a shiur at the Heichal HaTorah Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Stein died on Friday, 10 May 2002 (28 Iyar). He was buried on the Mount of Olives beside his son, Shmuel Zalman. He is survived by a son, Rabbi Aaron Stein, rosh yeshiva at Or Hameir Yeshiva in Peekskill, New York. One of his daughters is married to Hagaon Rabbi Yisroel Ginsburg Shlita, a Maggid shiur at the Yeshiva of Staten Island, and the other is married to Rabbi Avraham Doweck, a maggid shiur at the Telz Yeshiva in Cleveland. ==Published works== Stein's students published his Talmudic shiurim in pamphlets and other forms, among them a stenciled three- volume edition called Shiurei HaRav Pesach Stein (Lessons of Rabbi Pesach Stein). As the lectures increased, Stein responded to his students' requests and edited the pamphlets, reprinting them as a series of books called Likutei Shiurim (Collected Lessons).

The cathedral school at Chartres promoted scholarship before the first university was founded in France. Thierry was a major figure in twelfth-century philosophy and learning, and, like many twelfth-century scholars, is notable for his embrace of Plato's Timaeus and his application of philosophy to theological issues.Some nineteenth and twentieth-century scholars believed that Thierry was in the forefront of a hyper-Platonic school at Chartres (this is the position reflected in Turner's 1903 History of Philosophy, but due to the efforts of Richard Southern and others, this view is no longer held by modern scholars. Some modern scholars believed Thierry to have been a brother of Bernard of Chartres who had founded the school of Chartres, but later research has shown that this is unlikely.Paul Edward Dutton (ed.), The Glosae super Platonem of Bernard of Chartres, Toronto 1991, p. 40-42. Thierry became chancellor of Chartres after his predecessor, Gilbert of Poitiers, returned to his native city in 1141. John of Salisbury, Herman of Carinthia, and Clarembald of Arras were among Thierry's students. ==Works== Hexaemeron The Hexaemeron interprets the Genesis with reference to Plato's \\"Timaeus\\". The text serves as a reasoned defense of God's existence, by relying on Platonic natural philosophy and Aristotelian logic to explain the creation of the world. Thierry establishes that the moment of divine creation was the very beginning of time, and following that, creation evolved naturally through combinations of the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth).Lindberg, David C: \\"The Beginnings of Western Science\\", page 210. The University of Chicago Press, 2007. According to Thierry, God created the four elements in the first moment. Fire, which is constantly moving, rotated and lit up the air, causing the first night and day. On the second day, fire warmed the water, causing it to rise into the heavens and form clouds. Because of the reduction of water, land emerged on the third day. The continued heating of the waters above the firmament caused the water to create the heavenly bodies on the fourth day. The continued warming of land caused the plant, animal, and human life to arise on the fifth and sixth days. Thierry's explanation of the creation of the world is based on a theological interpretation of Aristotle's four causes, which he identifies with the three persons of the Trinity plus matter (made up of the four elements): the Father is the efficient cause, the Son is the formal cause, the Holy Spirit is the final cause and the four elements are the material cause. According to Thierry, the act of divine creation is limited to the creation of the four elements, which then evolve by themselves, mix according to mathematical proportions and make up the physical world. Heptateuch The Heptateuch is a broad encyclopedia of information relating to the liberal arts, all within the context of academic and theologic unity. It particularly examines the ways in which different types of knowledge can be distinguished, while still supporting a single purpose: explaining order in reality. The trivium (logic, grammar, and rhetoric) address the veracity, consistency, and beauty of the language of expression. The quadrivium (geometry, astronomy, arithmetic, and music) provide the intellectual content in need of expression. Thierry also wrote some commentaries on Boethius' De Trinitate. == Editions == * Commentaries on Boethius by Thierry of Chartres and His School, ed. N. M.

The club has in the past had a successful junior section which provided age group rugby with fully qualified coaches from 7 through to 16, although at the moment, in line with the national trend of a decline in rugby participation, only have teams at Under 7, 13 and 14.

A Golden Arrow bus with livery celebrating a partnership with bus manufacturer MAN Truck & Bus. Golden Arrow bus showing the company's old livery. Golden Arrow Bus Services (GABS) is the major public transport bus service operator for Cape Town, South Africa, providing commuter bus services throughout a large part of the City of Cape Town metropolitan area. Founded in 1861, and owned by South African holding company Hosken Consolidated Investments Limited, the company operates a fleet of over 1000 buses on 1300 routes, with a daily ridership of around 220,000 people. ==History== On 9 July 1861, an Act was passed that allowed for a company to be formed for the purpose of providing horse-drawn tram services between Sea Point and Cape Town. The founding company in the GABS dynasty was the Cape Town & Green Point Tramway Company, which began operating on the 1 April 1863. Major technological innovations that shaped the fledgling industry subsequent to this were the replacement of horse-drawn trams with electric trams in 1894; the introduction of fuel powered motor buses in 1911 and trackless electric trams in 1934. During this period of innovation, mergers and acquisitions amongst competitors occurred. In 1957, Golden Arrow Bus Services, which at the time had 85 buses and 400 employees, completed a take-over of the larger, listed Cape Tramways Limited, which had 500 buses and 2000 employees. In 1982, the company built its Arrowgate depot in the suburb of Montana, in Cape Town. At the time it was the largest and most modern depot in Southern Africa. GABS has also designed and built depot facilities in Woodstock, Philippi, Simon‚Äôs Town and Atlantis. In 2004, South African holding company Hosken Consolidated Investments Limited acquired Golden Arrow Bus Services. In 2011, Golden Arrow Bus Services took ownership of its 500th bus produced by German commercial vehicle manufacturer MAN Truck & Bus AG. MAN buses account for a large portion of GABS' fleet. ==Skills development== Golden Arrow Bus Services' Learning and Assessment Centre is accredited with the Transport Education and Training Authority (TETA) for all its professional driver training, and is also accredited with MerSETA. The Company utilizes a number of accredited service providers for management and leadership programs. Eligible employees are also able to access further study benefits from the company. GABS facilitates the provision of the following accredited programs: *Professional Driver Skills Program *National Certificate in Professional Driving *Automotive Repair and Retain Commercial Learnership *Automotive Workshop Assistant *Automotive Maintenance Assistant ==Corporate Social Responsibility== Via the donation of 50% of GABS' shares as a capital base, the Golden Arrow Foundation (GAF) was founded in 1993, as a way to give back to the communities served by Golden Arrow‚Äôs scheduled bus services. Following the acquisition of Golden Arrow Bus Services by Hosken Consolidated Investments, the Golden Arrow Foundation was incorporated into the HCI Foundation. Since then, the Foundation has continued to provide financial support to a number of community initiatives across a wide-spectrum, including education and early childhood development, health and welfare, and social development. Golden Arrow‚Äôs Corporate Social Investment efforts were recognised by the South African Department of Social Development and the National CSI Registrar as being a Level 3 Gold Contributor. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official website Category:Bus companies of South Africa Category:Companies based in Cape Town Category:Transport in Cape Town ","title":"Golden Arrow Bus Services"},{"id":"5570526","text":"Michael Konsel (born 6 March 1962 in Vienna) is a retired Austrian football goalkeeper. ==Club career== Konsel started his professional career with First Vienna and moved to local rivals Rapid Wien in 1985.

Roma in Serie A under manager Zdenƒõk Zeman; although he was initially not well-known in Italy, his impressive performances led him to be voted the best goalkeeper and best foreign footballer of the season in his first year with the club. After an injury- plagued second season in Rome he finished his career at Venezia, where he remained for a season. In 1996, he was chosen Austrian Footballer of the Year. He was voted in Rapid's Team of the Century in 1999, as well as in the A.S.

Nicknamed the panther, he possessed good reflexes and, having played both as midfielder and defender in his youth, was also known for his elegance and ability with the ball at his feet, as well as his speed and adeptness when coming off his line to collect crosses or when rushing out to anticipate opponents, and often functioned as a sweeper-keeper throughout his career, in particular in teams which relied on a high defensive line, the offside-trap, and zonal marking systems. One of his main influences as a goalkeeper was Dino Zoff. ==Media appearances== Konsel participated in the third season of the Austrian television dance competition Dancing Stars in 2007, coming in seventh place. ==Honours== Club ;Rapid Wien *Austrian Football Bundesliga (3): 1986‚Äì87, 1987‚Äì88, 1995‚Äì96 *Austrian Cup (3): 1984‚Äì85, 1986‚Äì87, 1994‚Äì95 *Austrian Supercup (3): 1986, 1987, 1988 Individual *Best Young Player of the Austrian Football Bundesliga (1): 1985 *Austrian Footballer of the Year (3): 1987, 1995, 1996 *Austrian Football Bundesliga Best Goalkeeper of the Year (4): 1987‚Äì88, 1994‚Äì95, 1995‚Äì96, 1996‚Äì97 *Rapid Wien's Team of the Century: 1999 *A.S.

Nigel Spearing was born in Hammersmith, London, and educated at Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1956, he worked as a tutor and teacher, firstly at Wandsworth School (1956‚Äì68) and then at Elliott School, Putney, (1969‚Äì70). After coming second in Warwick and Leamington in 1964, Spearing was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament for Acton at the 1970 general election, regaining a seat which the Labour Party had lost to the Conservative Kenneth Baker in a 1968 by-election. Spearing turned Baker's by-election majority of 3,720 into a Labour majority of 660. Prior to the February 1974 general election, the Acton constituency underwent major boundary changes and he was defeated in his bid for re-election by the Conservative Party candidate George Young by 1,451 votes. Spearing then returned to parliament a few weeks later after winning the Newham South by-election (caused by the constituency's MP, Elwyn Jones, being made a life peer in order to take on the role of Lord Chancellor) with a majority of 9,321. This was the only by-election held in the February‚ÄìOctober 1974 Parliament. Spearing was then re-elected at the October 1974 general election, and held the Newham South seat until 1997, when the seat was abolished. Spearing and another sitting Labour MP both applied for the newly created seat of Poplar and Canning Town, but both were passed over in favour of Jim Fitzpatrick. Spearing was opposed to British membership of the European Economic Community. Although he was interested in many issues, including transport, he devoted much of his time to campaigning against the EEC/EU, not least because he believed that 'many of the most pressing domestic political issues of the day could also be firmly connected with European Union institutions and directives.'

On 31 July, it was announced that Heraf and New Zealand Football parted ways and that he would leave by the end of the week, after thirteen players refused to play and complained about him. ==FootnotesReferencesExternal links== * Player profile and stats ‚Äì Rapid Archive * 2.

The shire, administered from the town of Mullumbimby, covers an area of , and has existed as a local government entity since 1906. The shire was named for Cape Byron, itself named by Captain Cook in May 1770 in honour of Vice-Admiral John Byron. The Mayor of Byron Shire Council is Simon Richardson, a member of the Greens. ==History== Byron Shire was created on 7 March 1906 under the as one of 134 local government areas in regional New South Wales. On 16 May 1906, a temporary council of five members was appointed to administer it, and elections were held in November. On 4 December, the council convened for the first time with William Baker as its inaugural president. William Baker was born in Great Stanmore, England. His cousin, Alfred Joseph Baker was the first person to score a goal in international football against Scotland in 1870. On 1 July 1908, the Mullumbimby Municipality was created out of part of Byron. On 1 October 1980, the municipality and the shire were re-amalgamated by direction of the NSW Minister for Local Government. == Heritage listings == The Byron Shire has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * High Conservation Value Old Growth forest ==Towns and localities== ; Byron (SE) * Byron Bay * Bangalow * Broken Head * Coopers Shoot * Ewingsdale * Hayters Hill * McLeods Shoot * Newrybar (shared with Ballina) * Skinners Shoot * Suffolk Park * Talofa * Tyagarah ; Mullumbimby/Brunswick (NE) * Mullumbimby * Brunswick Heads * Billinudgel * Crabbes Creek * Montecollum * Mullumbimby Creek * Myocum * New Brighton * Ocean Shores * South Golden Beach * The Pocket * Wilsons Creek * Wooyung (shared with Tweed) * Yelgun ; Other (W) * Binna Burra * Booyong (shared with Lismore) * Coorabell * Eureka * Federal * Goonengerry * Huonbrook * Koonyum Range * Main Arm * Middle Pocket * Nashua * Palmwoods * Possum Creek * Repentance Creek * Upper Coopers Creek * Upper Main Arm * Upper Wilsons Creek * Wanganui ==Demographics== In the 2016 census, there were people in the Byron local government area, of these 48.2 per cent were male and 51.8 per cent were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.8 per cent of the population, which is lower than the national and averages of 2.8 per cent and lower than the NSW state average of 2.9 per cent. The median age of people in the Byron Shire area is 44 years (up from the 42 in the 2011 census) which was slightly higher than the national median of 38 years. Children aged 0 ‚Äì 14 years made up 16.8 per cent of the population (down from 18.5 in the 2011 census) and people aged 65 years and over made up 16.9 per cent per cent of the population (up from 13.3 per cent).

The ABS records marital status in everyone over the age of 15, in Byron Shire 37.1 per cent of the population is married whilst 18.1 per cent are divorced or separated. Whilst there has been little change in Byron since the 2011 census, compared to the national percentages there is a large difference. Of the Australian population aged 15 and older 48.1 per cent of the population is married and 11.7 per cent of the population is divorced or separated. This shows that Byron Shire has a large discrepancy in marital status compared to the rest of the nation. Population in the Byron Shire area has increased since the 2011 census with a population growth of 8 percent, this is a significant increase compared to the population growth between the 2006 and 2011 census which was 1.54 per cent. Whilst the growth since 2011 is similar to the Australian population growth on 8.8 percent, the growth in previous years, negative 0.51 per cent in 2001 to 2006 and 1.54 per cent in 2006 to 2011, is vastly different to the total population growth.

A large proportion of Byron Shire residents are born in Australia with 68.4 per cent of the population, 52 percent of the population have had both parents born in Australia, meaning less than half the population is first generation Australian or a migrant. The second largest country of origin is England with only 5.1 per cent, this reflects the diversity of those that aren't Australian born.

Its sequel, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World, was released on the Wii in 2008. The story takes place in a world known as Sylvarant. Lloyd Irving accompanies his childhood friend, Colette Brunel, who is chosen by the angels to travel and unseal Sylvarant's temples to restore mana, a necessary energy to sustain life, to the world.Raine: Today is the Day of Prophecy. It is a very important day, which the Chosen of Mana will receive an oracle from the Goddess Martel. Now, Chosen One‚Ä¶Colette. Tell us about the journey of world regeneration. /Colette: It is a journey to seal the Desians. Upon passing the trials of the Goddess Martel, the Summon Spirits that protect the world awaken, and mana is restored. They are accompanied by Genis Sage and Raine Sage, half-elves from their village, and a mercenary named Kratos Aurion. During their journey, they learn from Sheena Fujibayashi about the existence of a parallel world called Tethe'alla and how their quest redirects Tethe'alla's flow of mana towards Sylvarant.Raine: Then the Chosen‚Äôs world regeneration is actually the process of reversing the mana flow? /Sheena: Exactly. When the Chosen breaks the seal, the mana flow reverses, and the Summon Spirit that governs the seal awakens. The party then discover that their religion and mana system are a facade created by an organization called Cruxis led by Mithos Yggdrasill. The party then travel to Tethe'alla where Zelos Wilder, Presea Combatir, and Regal Bryant join them in their cause to save the two worlds. The sequel, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World takes place two years after Sylvarant and Tethe'alla's reunification, which caused extreme climate change. It follows Emil Castagnier and Marta Lualdi as they journey to awaken the deity known as Ratatosk to solve the world's climate problem. ==Protagonists== Lloyd Irving :Voiced by (English): Scott Menville (ToS) Voiced by (Japanese): Katsuyuki Konishi is a strong-hearted young man who wishes for peace in the world without the sacrifice of others.Lloyd: I've been thinking about that for a long time. Someone asked me why I came all the way to Tethe'alla‚Ä¶ what it is that I want to do. I want a world where everyone can have a normal life. I'm tired of people having to become sacrifices. I'm tired of discrimination. I'm tired of people becoming victims. I'm tired of it all. Orphaned as a child, he was adopted and raised by a dwarf, Dirk.Dirk: That Exsphere is your mother‚Äôs keepsake. The Desians killed your mother in order to take it from her. /Lloyd: They did? /Dirk: I told you about how I found you at the cliff near the ranch, right? Your mother was still conscious at that time, so she explained everything. There‚Äôs no doubt about it. When Lloyd learns his mother, Anna, was killed by the Desians, he decides to join Colette's journey.Lloyd: So about tomorrow‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt come along with you, can I? /Colette: Well, it‚Äôs just that the Desians will be after us and it‚Äôs going to be a dangerous journey. /Lloyd: Desians‚Ä¶up till now. I always thought my mom died in an accident. ‚Ä¶But she was murdered by Desians! Now that I know the truth, there‚Äôs no way that I could keep living in a village that has a treaty with them. During the journey, Lloyd kills Kvar, one of the Desian Grand Cardinals, after learning that Kvar's Angelus Project caused the death of Lloyd's mother.Kvar: That Exsphere is without a doubt the product of my Angelus Project! [...] Kvar: Hmm, you don't know anything, do you? That Exsphere was cultured on host body A012, human name, Anna‚Äîyour mother. She took it and escaped from the facility. Of course, she paid for her crime with her life. As Lloyd continues his journey with the party, he is chosen to wield the Eternal Sword to help them achieve their goals.Dirk: So you want me to forge the Ring of the Pact? [...] /Lloyd: With this, I‚Äôll be able to use the Eternal Sword, right? To accommodate for his dual-sword fighting style, the Eternal Sword's powers enter Lloyd's Material Blades.[Lloyd pulls the Eternal Sword out of its pedestal. The Eternal Sword becomes a ball of light, splits into two, and fuses with his Material Blade] After merging the two worlds and germinating the Great Seed into a Giant Kharlan Tree, Martel pronounces Lloyd as the tree's guardian and asks him to name it.Martel: Then Lloyd, on behalf of all living things, I want you to give this tree a new name, as a proof of the pact./Lloyd: What?/Martel: The Giant Kharlan Tree was planted here by the elves when they first came, as a guardian to watch over and protect them. This newly reborn tree protects elves, humans and the lives of all who have caught in between. Therefore, this tree requires a new name. In the sequel, Dawn of the New World, Lloyd is pronounced the culprit of the Blood Purge, a massacre in the village in which Emil Castagnier resides.Library Synopsis Entry 23 Emil: That was when I first learned the truth about the Blood Purge where Palmacosta was attacked by the Church of Martel, and my parents and many others were brutally murdered. I had believed the attack occurred because the Vanguard was holding a meeting in Palmacosta, and that was indeed correct. However, the purpose of that meeting was so they could launch a rebellion against the Church of Martel by using Ratatosk's core. Lloyd then led the Martel Knights into the city under the pretext of quelling the rebellion (though his real reason was that he planned to steal Ratatosk's core), and they killed many innocent people. My parents never did anything to deserve what happened to them. Lloyd cuts all ties with his friends after the incident and begins his search for the Centurion's cores. The protagonists later learn Lloyd has been framed by Decus for the Blood Purge and that Lloyd had been gathering the Centurion's cores to stop Ratatosk from destroying humanity; the reason for his silence was to prevent Ratatosk, who is able to gather information from monsters, to learn about his plans.Library Synopsis Entry 163 Marta: He says that Emil is indeed the Summon Spirit Ratatosk, and that Lloyd had been working to stop Ratatosk from eradicating humanity. But he had not been trying to kill Ratatosk. On the contrary, if Ratatosk were to die, the door in Ginnungagap would open, and this would become the demonic realm, Niflheim. So Lloyd and Yuan had planned to seal Ratatosk alive in the Ginnungagap instead. To do that, they needed the Centurions' and Ratatosk's cores. Lloyd didn't tell this plan to anyone, because he did not want Ratatosk to find out about it. Ratatosk has a wide ranging network of monsters, and he didn't know where they might be listening. They could only discuss the plan here at the World Tree, were Ratatosk has no influence. Lloyd has received positive reception in Japan. In the second Tales series character popularity polls, Lloyd ranked as who people want as an older brother, younger brother, and friend categories. Since then, Lloyd has ranked on the Tales series popular characters polls. He appears as a playable character in Tales of the World, Tales of VS., and Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave and as a skill in the Nintendo DS version of Tales of Hearts. Outside of the Tales franchise, Lloyd is a playable character in Soulcalibur Legends. A Mii Fighter costume based on Lloyd's design appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U as downloadable content. Colette Brunel :Voiced by (English): Heather Hogan (ToS) Voiced by (Japanese): Nana Mizuki is the Chosen of Mana of Sylvarant; also known as the Chosen of Regeneration, the one who will bring peace and prosperity to the world. She was brought up with the knowledge that she would need to die to save the world, and, from that, has gained a truly selfless nature.Raine: I promised Colette I wouldn‚Äôt say anything. Colette will give up her life in order to regenerate the world. Becoming an angel means dying. As the party travels to the seals, Colette gains more angelic powers, but loses her humanity.Lloyd: Colette is growing closer to becoming an angel. Now, she can‚Äôt sleep or feel hot or cold or pain or anything. She can‚Äôt even cry! Becoming an angel means losing her humanity! The final seal removes her personality and leaves her as a lifeless shell.Kratos: Not only did she lose her memory, but she has lost the soul to listen to your words. Now Colette is merely a puppet standing before death‚Äôs door. After learning that their journey is all a ruse by Cruxis to revive Martel, the party flee to Tethe'alla to find a cure for Colette. They learn that Colette's condition and angelic powers are caused by her Cruxis Crystal, an advanced evolution of the Exsphere, and cure her by attaching a Key Crest to control the Cruxis Crystal.Researcher: Cruxis Crystals are thought to be evolved forms of Exspheres. [...] / Raine: In which case, the ritual of releasing the seals may be promoting the fusion with the Cruxis Crystal. [...] / Zelos: Then, if she had a Key Crest, she‚Äôd return to normal, right? Researcher: Yes, she should be able to freely control the Cruxis Crystal if she had a Key Crest. As the party continues on their journey, Colette becomes inflicted with Chronic Angelus Crystallus Inofficium, a disease that turns the body into a Cruxis Crystal.Raine: It says it's called, \\"Chronic Angelus Crystallus Inofficium.\\" Just like the Altessa's diagnosis. It's an illness that causes the entire body to become a Cruxis Crystal. The party then searches for the materials needed to adjust Colette's Key Crest in order to cure her.Genis: So in other words, we need a Mana Fragment, Zircon, and a Unicorn Horn, right? /Raine: And a Mana Leaf Herb. Then, we make something called a Rune Crest, and attaching that to the Key Crest will suppress the crystal‚Äôs activity. In the sequel, Dawn of the New World, Colette begins searching for Lloyd after the Blood Purge.Colette:So Lloyd hasn't stopped by here either. Colette was ranked on the first Tales series character popularity polls. In the second Tales series popularity polls, Colette ranked as the character people want as a younger sister, and has made appearances on the next four polls as well. Since her debut, she has made regular appearances as a playable character in the Tales of the World series. Genis Sage :Voiced by (English): Colleen Villard (ToS) Voiced by (Japanese): Ai Orikasa Genis Sage, known as in the original Japanese version, is the younger brother of Raine Sage. He is a child prodigy and a great cook. The Sages are both half-elves, but they pass themselves off as full-blooded elves to avoid discrimination. During the beginning of the game, Genis incites Lloyd to help Marble, an inmate belonging to the Desian's human ranches. Their actions provoke the Desians to attack their village resulting in Lloyd's exile. Genis decides to follow Lloyd as the two meet with Colette's group on their journey. To assist them, Genis uses Marble's Exsphere to increase his powers.Lloyd: I will atone for what I've done. I swear to protect Colette for the sake of those who have died because of me. /Genis: I'll follow you, Lloyd. It's my fault that you were banished. So I promise to stick by you, always. /Lloyd: Say, Genis. Why don‚Äôt you use that Exsphere? That‚Äôs Marble‚Äôs memento. In Tethe'alla, the Sage's race were revealed and accepted by the party. During the course of the journey, Genis becomes close friends with Mithos. After learning Mithos' true identity and apparently defeating him, Genis holds onto Mithos' Cruxis Crystal.Lloyd: Is this Mithos‚Äô Cruxis Crystal?/ Genis: I‚Äôm sorry. I picked it up in the Tower of Salvation, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to destroy it. I took it with me. I thought, I‚Äôd at least show him the regenerated world. The Cruxis Crystal is later destroyed when Mithos is revealed to still be alive in it. In Dawn of the New World, Genis is on a search for Lloyd after the Blood Purge.Brother and Sister skit Genis appeared on the first character popularity polls; He ranked on the second and sixth popularity polls in the character people want as a younger brother category. Since his debut, he has made regular appearances as a playable character in the Tales of the World series. Kratos Aurion :Voiced by (English): Cam Clarke (ToS) Voiced by (Japanese): Fumihiko Tachiki is a mysterious mercenary who is hired to accompany Colette on her journey. He is later revealed as a high-ranking member of Cruxis and one of Mithos Yggdrasill's companions who was ordered to ensure Colette would finish her journey.Kratos: I am of Cruxis, the organization that guides this world. I am one of the Four Seraphim, sent forth to keep close watch over the Chosen.Elder Elf: The ones who betrayed Origin and used the power of the magic sword given by Origin to split the world in two, were none other than Mithos and his companions. Mithos Yggdrasill, his older sister Martel, and their companions, Yuan and Kratos. The four angels changed the nature of the world, and that is why their names are taboo in Heimdall. After betraying the party to Mithos, Kratos secretly searches for materials to enable Lloyd to use the Eternal Sword.Lloyd: Zelos, you heard about the ring from Kratos, didn't you? /Zelos: He‚Ä¶he knew everything. That humans can't use the Eternal Sword, the details of Colette's sickness, the way to make the Eternal Ring, everything. He is revealed to be Lloyd's father after Yuan fails to blackmail him into releasing the summon spirit Origin.Lloyd: Where's my dad? If you've done anything to my dad, I'll tear every last one of you to pieces!/Yuan: Now, now, is that the way to act when you're about to meet your father for the first time?/Kratos: So it was you. You were the assassin who tried to kill me at Hima./Yuan: Kratos. If you value your son's life at all, do as we say. After gathering the materials to make the Eternal Ring, Kratos has the party form a contract with Origin to enable Lloyd to wield the Eternal Sword. After reuniting the two worlds, Kratos leaves for Derris-Kharlan with the remaining members of Cruxis.Lloyd: Are you really going to Derris-Kharlan?/Kratos: If a half-elf of Cruxis remains here, the other half-elves will have no place to live. As a surviving member of Cruxis, I must bear the responsibility for what has happened. In Dawn of the New World, he makes a final transmission to Yuan before Derris-Kharlan is out of range.Kratos: It seems we've finally reached the limit of the communication range. From this point onward, we'll be swallowed up in the vast darkness of space. /Yuan: Then this is our final farewell. Are you sure you don't want Lloyd to know? /Kratos: There's no need. Lloyd and I said our goodbyes before I left there. My place is in the past. I'm counting on you to look after the World Tree. His past is explored through side stories. Over 4000 years prior to the game, Kratos was the lead knight of Tethe'alla's capital. He meets Mithos and Martel who asks him to arrange a meeting with Tethe'alla's king to warn him about an upcoming invasion by Sylvarant. The king ignores Mithos' pleas due to his race and Tethe'alla's capital is destroyed in the attack. Mithos, Martel, and Kratos are exiled from the capital after being deemed responsible for the attack and Kratos joins the two as they journey the world to find a new home. After Mithos saves the world, Kratos leaves for Sylvarant after disagreeing with Mithos' Age of Lifeless Beings plan and meets Anna who encourages him to stop Mithos.Kratos: Like Presea, Anna was a research subject of the Angelus Project. They were trying to create a Cruxis Crystal inside her body. When I learned of Mithos' plan to create an Age of Lifeless Beings, I turned against him and descended upon this land, where I met Anna. [...] After meeting Anna, I realized my mistake in believing that accepting Mithos' vision would be the fastest route to reunite the worlds. I began to search for a way for a human to wield the Eternal Sword. The two then flee from Cruxis where Lloyd was born during their flight. Kvar corners them and turns Anna into a monster, forcing Kratos to kill her.Kratos: Yes. However, Anna and I were pursued by Cruxis. We traveled from place to place, and when you were born, with you as well, but we were finally caught by Kvar. [...] Her Exsphere was removed. Lacking a Key Crest, the mana in her body went out of control, and she turned into a monster. Kratos battle with Kvar causes Lloyd and Noishe to fall off a cliff where Kratos assumed they both died.Kratos:After that, Kvar attacked, then you and Noishe fell down the cliff along with the Exsphere. I fought off Kvar and his men, and descended the cliff, but all that was left were the Desian corpses, half-eaten by monsters. I thought there was no way you could still be alive. Kratos' reception has been positive in Japan. He appeared on the first Tales character popularity polls and in the second one the character people want as an older brother and a teacher categories. Since then, he has appeared in all current polls. He is a playable character in the Tales of the World series, Tales of VS., and makes a cameo appearance as an enemy in Tales of Vesperia. Raine Sage :Voiced by (English): Kari Wahlgren (ToS) Voiced by (Japanese): Yumi T≈çma Raine Sage, known as in the original Japanese version, is Genis' older sister and Iselia's schoolteacher. Raine is a calm, pragmatic thinker who is mistrustful of others and is a terrible cook. In the past, Raine and Genis were Tethe'allans who were sent to Sylvarant by the use of the Otherworldly Gate, a portal that intertwines the world.Tethe'allan Man: There are huge rocks all over it.

They were sent to Sylvarant by their mother Virginia to escape Tethe'alla's discriminatory laws.Virginia's Diary The Otherworldly gate has opened. Raine, Genis, please forgive your powerless mother.

He was a summon spirit of the Great Tree of old, and is the lord of all monsters. During battle, Ratatosk's personality takes over giving Emil red eyes and an aggressive personality. As he journeys with Marta to gather the Centurion's cores to awaken Ratatosk, Emil discovers he is Ratatosk and that the timid Emil's personality and memories are a fabrication.Emil: Am I really Ratatosk? I still can't believe it. /Tenebrae: It's only natural that it wouldn't seem real to you. Your current personality is a fabrication put together by Lord Ratatosk. Lord Ratatosk's own memories are kept by the side all of you know as his \\"Ratatosk Mode.\\" He learns that the real Emil Castagnier died in the blood purge and that his physical appearance is an imitation of , Richter's close friend.Library Synopsis Entry 169 Emil: I don't know why I chose Aster as my human form. Perhaps when Marta summoned me, and I had to be reborn as a human, I simply went with the form of the last human I had seen before entering my core state. When Aster and Richter pleaded with Ratatosk to restore the worlds climate, Ratatosk killed Aster.Library Synopsis Entry 158 Emil: Aster was calling out to me, calling me Ratatosk. Beside him stood Richter. The two of them had come to ask me‚Äîto ask Ratatosk‚Äîto restore the balance of mana in order to end the strange weather fluctuations. I had only just awakened, and despised the humans and the half-elves who had destroyed the Giant Kharlan Tree that had been my host. So I wanted to have then destroyed. Aster tried to stop me.

When the party confronts Richter to prevent him from opening the door to Niflheim, the world of demons, two outcomes are decided by the player. After Richter's defeat, Emil will either kill himself and have Ratatosk's core act as a seal to Niflheim, or persuade Ratatosk to resume guarding the door. In the latter choice, Ratatosk divides himself into two allowing Emil to live his life.Ricther: Since you're capable of diving into both a core and a physical body‚Ä¶Perhaps you could separate into two forms, Emil and Ratatosk, and live that way. If necessary, you could live off my body [...] Tenebrae: We centurions and monsters would be happy to carry out that task, under your orders of course. As long as you stay in contact, there's no issue with dividing yourself in two forms. [...] Verius: Ratatosk, your heart has spoken. It wishes you to live the life that Aster, who died at your hands, could not. I am prepared to carry out that wish for you.

You call yourself the \\"Chosen\\"?! You're nothing more than a coward! How dare you! If you hadn't run away, my mother would still be alive.

Ratatosk attached a fake Ratatosk core on her forehead to draw his enemies attention away from him and she is accompanied by Tenebrae since then.Library Synopsis Entry 159 Emil: But Tenebrae told me that the core on Marta's forehead is a fake designed to draw the attention of Ratatosk's enemies to Marta. If that's true, then that's totally despicable! I was using Marta as a decoy to protect myself. Soon after, Marta defects from the Vanguard upon learning of their plans on using Ratatosk's core to destroy Tethe'alla. She is pursued by the Vanguard and is reunited with Ratatosk, now under the Emil personality, during her flight. Together, the three travel around the world to gather Centurions' cores to revive Ratatosk.Library Synopsis Entry 20 Emil: Ratatosk's core is the jewel on Marta's forehead, and Marta also wants Ratatosk to awaken so she can remove the core from her forehead. However, Ratatosk can't wake up until we first wake all of the Centurions who serve him. This is the reason that Marta and Tenebrae are on a journey to find all of the Centurions' cores.

He is introduced under his surname as an adult but is able to interchange into his child body since his appearance and growth is controlled by his Exsphere.

Four thousand years prior to the game, he and his companions, Martel, Kratos, and Yuan, ended the war between the countries Sylvarant and Tethe'alla by using the Eternal Sword and splitting the two into different worlds. His plan was to reunite the worlds when the comet known as Derris Kharlan approaches Earth so he can use its mana to germinate the Great Seed into a Giant Kharlan Tree. The humans attempted to monopolize the Great Seed and killed Martel in the process. Daunted by her death, Mithos delays the germination and instead places Martel's soul inside the Great Seed until he can find a new body for her. Her death caused him to gain a strong hatred towards the world and becomes cruel and merciless. Years later, Mithos forms the organization known as Cruxis in order to find a compatible body for Martel and to fulfill his Age of Lifeless Beings plan, a plan where everyone's consciousness will live inside their Exspheres free from their body;Yggdrasill: People fear and hate what is not normal. They are scared of those that are different. Then the solution is for everyone to become the same. By using the Exspheres to eliminate the different bloods that flow through elves and humans, everyone on this earth will become the same lifeless beings. Discrimination will vanish. That is the grand age I strive for. the latter being a twisted interpretation of Martel's last wish.Lloyd: You‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt approve of Mithos‚Äô Age of Half-elves? /Yuan: That plan was the result of a twisted perception of Martel‚Äôs last wish. It‚Äôs not what she truly desired. /Colette: What was Martel‚Äôs last wish? /Yuan: She said she wanted to see a world free from discrimination. Mithos' ideas resulted in the deaths and suffering of many people and the party is forced to kill him. In the second Tales character popularity poll, Mithos ranked in the memorable villain category.

The members of both groups are half-elves who want revenge against humans for the discrimination they suffered; Cruxis members are given Cruxis Crystals, which gives them angel-like wings.Yuan: The Church of Martel is nothing more than an instrument created by Cruxis to rule the world. Those who call themselves angels are half-elves, who've evolved by using a special type of Exsphere called Cruxis Crystals. They aren't gods or anything of the sort. Of course, the Church of Martel and the Chosen know nothing about that. The party is initially led by on Collete's World Regeneration.

He had planned to overthrow Yggdrasill with the use of his creation, the mana cannon.Rodyle: Who cares about the lives of pathetic inferior beings?! The Mana Cannon will be completed once I get the Cruxis Crystal. With Thor's Hammer in my possession, Yggdrasill and Cruxis will beg for my mercy! The final member, Pronyma, a woman who worships and loves Yggdrasill, is the leader of the Five Desian Grand Cardinals. She was killed by Yggdrasill after addressing him as Mithos. Richter Abend :Voiced by: Kenji Hamada the main antagonist of Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World. He is a half elf and a scientist. When he and Aster tried to persuade Ratatosk to restore the world's climate, Aster was killed and Richter retaliated against Ratatosk.Ratatosk: Even if my powers are still weak from just waking, a mere mortal wounding me? Richter: Die! Tenebrae saves Ratatosk's core before it was destroyed and flees from Richter. Since then, Richter has been researching on how to kill Ratatosk. Since Ratatosk's death would open the door to Niflheim, allowing demons to enter their world, Richter intends to use his life to seal the door after killing Ratatosk.Tenebrae: The demons are using all the power they have to open the door! /Richter: Here use this. /Lloyd: What the‚ÄîThat's the Sacred Stone! Richter: Yes, that's right. The stone that turns the mana in your body into flames. Mana is a toxic poison to demons. It will help keep the door closed for a while. /Lloyd: But why do you have it? /Richter: I sent someone out to the hidden village of the elves to get it for me. If you use it along with the Cruxis Crystal held by the Chosen, then it's possible to seal this door without Ratatosk being present. /Lloyd: The Chosen's Cruxis Crystal has the ability to stop its host's internal clock, and grant them eternal life. You were willing to burn your own body's mana for all eternity and become a human sacrifice in order to guard this oor. /Richter: Yes, because that way Aster could come back to life, Ratatosk would die, and the door would be protected. The world would be saved. When the party confronts Richter at the Ginnungagap, the realm between their world and Niflheim, Richter uses the demon's powers to confront them but is defeated. Having forced open the seal on the door, Richter remains with Ratatosk at the Ginnungagap to prevent the demons from crossing over.Emil: The ancient seal on the door is no longer working since another being forced it open. /Richter: That would be my fault. It looks like I'll need to go ahead with my original plan to seal the door with my own mana. He was a playable character in Tales of VS. Vanguard The is an organization manipulated by Richter to serve his goals. They are a Sylvarant organization determined to destroy Tethe'alla. To complete their plans, they sent assassins after Marta Lualdi in order to retrieve the Ratatosk core from her. The Vanguard are led by whose mind has been warped by the Centurion's core, Solum.Brute: Richter was the one who told me. He said that we could free the Sylvaranti people with the mana cannon. He told me to become their king. It sounds so ridiculous now. Why did I agree? Ever since he handed me Solum's core, my memory, it's all so hazy. Four notable members of the Vanguard are , , , and . Alice is a sadistic young female half-elf and leader of the Vanguard's army's Battle Combat system. She has brainwashed monsters under her control and abuses Decus' feelings towards her in order to have him do her bidding. Eight years prior to the game, Alice's parents were forced on a pilgrimage by the Church of Martel that caused their deaths.Alice: What'll the Church of Martel do for me? Will it bring my parents back to life? Will it bring back my mother and father killed by monsters while on a pilgrimage forced by the church? She was then sent to an orphanage where she makes a pact with a demon to save Decus' life after he was framed for a mugging by the orphanage's director; Alice is then freed from the pact by Lloyd's party years later.Decus: There was this group of adventurers. One of them was killed, and his valuables were stolen. They blamed me. The real culprits were the orphanage director and his sons, but no one would listen to me. [...] The others lynched me and were about to kill me. No one in the orphanage so much as lifted a finger, but then monsters attacked. [...] Decus: Alice made a pact with one such demon. She agreed to find the Forbidden Tome of the Demon Lords, in exchange for the demon's power. /Lloyd: You mean the book demon lords were sealed inside? /Decus: Or so they say. The demon who helped Alice was the servant of a demon lord sealed into the book by the Hero Mithos. However, the demon passed away leaving its bones behind, and Alice was freed. But at the same time, she lost the ability to control monsters, which is why she has to rely on machines to do it for her. /Raine: The weaker demons must've been destroyed by mana when we burned the forbidden book, severing the connection to the demon lords. Since then, Decus has dedicated his whole life for her.Decus: If not for Alice, I'd be dead right now. The rest of my life belongs to her. When Decus is killed by Emil, Alice acknowledges her love for him before she also dies.Decus: Alice... you always said that that I disgust you, but I... I love you. /Alice: Decus! Oh Decus, I love you too. I do. I really do love you! [...] Decus, don't worry. I'll be with you again soon. Soon, we'll be together. The last two members are Hawk, a cowardly and weak man and subordinate of Alice and Decus. He was killed by Brute in a cross fire; and Magnar, a knight who infiltrated the Church of Martel.Emil: Magnar? Why's he here? Isn't he with the Church of Martel? /Tenebrae: It seems he was only pretending to be a Martel Knight. The incidents in Luin and Palmacosta were most likely part of an elaborate scheme to cast blame on the Church of Martel. After Brute regains his sanity, he disbands the Vanguard. ==Other characters== Martel Yggdrasill :Voiced by (English): Kim Mai Guest Voiced by (Japanese): Misa Watanabe is Mithos's older sister and a half-elf.

In the present time, Martel is passed down in stories as a goddess by Cruxis, which also created a religion to worship her. When Mithos revives Martel through Colette, Martel reprimands him for the cruelty and murder his actions have caused.Martel: I‚Äôve been watching all this time. Unable to move, unable to do anything, I watched all those foolish things you‚Äôve done. Have you forgotten everything? We stopped the Ancient War because we dreamt of a world where humans, elves, and those in between could live in harmony.

When the Great Seed is germinated, Martel's souls and Tabatha are taken in and used to create the Summon Spirit for the Giant Kharlan Tree.Martel: I am Martel, and also the incarnation of the Great Seed itself. Lloyd, your hope as well as those of many others, resurrected me./Lloyd: So you're Mithos' sister?!/Martel: No. Mithos' sister Martel, is one of the many source within me. I am Mana, and I am the Giant Tree. I am a symbol of the many lives sacrificed to the Great Seed. I am the new spirit born to accompany the Giant Tree. And now the Seed has awakened anew along with me. Lloyd forms a pact with Martel, promising to protect it, and names the tree Yggdrasill.Martel: This is the future form of the Giant Tree. Right now, it is only a small seedling. In its current rate, the tree will wither and die. /Lloyd: Well then, how do we protect it?! /Martel: You must provide the tree with love and adoration. As long as those conditions are met, I shall always protect the seedling. /Lloyd: I promise! If the tree starts to wither, I‚Äôll make sure, we won‚Äôt let it die! /Martel: Then Lloyd, on behalf of all living things, I want you to give this tree a new name, as a proof of the pact.

Before the final confrontation with Richter, Tenebrae deduces Emil's plan to suicide and have Ratatosk's core seal the door to niflheim and keeps it a secret from the party.Tenebrae: If I'm wrong please forgive me, but you didn't actually make up your mind to protect the gate as Ratatosk, did you? You regret having killed Aster, so you intend to somehow turn yourself back into a core, and become a lock on the door. In the fifth and sixth Tales series character popularity polls, Tenebrae ranked in the mascot category. Aqua :Voiced by: Y≈çko Honda is the Centurion of Water. She was the one who lead Aster and Richter to Ratatosk's location. After witnessing Ratatosk kill Aster and swear revenge against humanity, she journeys with Richter who plans on saving the world by killing Ratatosk and sacrificing himself to seal niflheim.Tenebrae: Why did you decide to side with Richter and betray us?Aqua: Because I want to help Master Richter avenge his friend. Master Richter and Aster first learned about Lord Ratatosk through their research of Summon Spirits. They found me, and told me that they had wanted to advise Lord Ratatosk about the Centurions losing control. I brought them to the Ginnungagap, to the door to the demonic realm, just beyond here. But Lord Ratatosk simply refused to listen to what Master Richter and Aster had to say. I couldn't believe it... Instead he lashed out at them because of his hatred of mankind! He killed Aster, and Master Richter was gravely wounded. [...] Lord Ratatosk ordered us to annihilate mankind. How can you possibly help him? ==Notes and references== Notes References Primary references * * Category:K≈çsuke Fujishima Tales of Symphonia Symphonia, Tales of Lloyd Irving ","title":"List of Tales of Symphonia characters"},{"id":"5570614","text":"Wellington City Libraries is the public library service for Wellington, New Zealand. ==Wellington Central Library== The Central Public library (Also known as Wellington Free Library) first opened in 1893 on the corner of Mercer and Wakefield Streets, Designed by William Crichton a prominent architect in his time. The building was demolished in 1945 due to \\"earthquake concerns\\", although this is disputable. The site was later occupied by the City Council Municipal buildings that are still in use today. The Wellington City Council archives holds the original plans and correspondence for this building. It seems there was concern over the foundations when it was originally built. In 1937 a new library opened on a block between Mercer and Harris street. The building was subsequently converted into the City Gallery Wellington. In 1991 the new central branch library opened on Victoria and Mercer Streets along the edge of the Civic Square. Ian Athfield of Athfield Architects had designed the new building, which Fletcher Development and Construction built. The library building consists of three main floors. The ground floor contains fiction, the Sound and Vision centre, the Young Adult and Children's collections and the main circulation desks. The first floor houses the sciences, humanities, arts, music and literature collections. The travel, history and New Zealand reference collections are located on the second floor. Two floors above the Library have until recently been leased by the Department of Conservation. A basement level serves for vehicle parking and day-to-day circulation duties. The high-level portico bridge linking the library building to the WCC service centre building was demolished in 2013 as an earthquake risk. Awards The library has won two New Zealand architectural awards; the Environmental Award in the Carter Holt Harvey Awards in 1992 and the National Award for Architecture 1993 sponsored by the New Zealand Institute of Architects. In 2006 the New Zealand Music Board honoured the Library with an excellence award for its \\"Sing along with Stu\\" storytime-programme.  Library closure  A decision was made by the Wellington City Council to close the Central Library on the Tuesday 19 March 2019, 8:30pm, after receiving advice from engineers that the building has structural vulnerabilities which mean it may not perform well in the event of a significant earthquake. Two pop-up replacement libraries have opened in central Wellington, Arapaki Manners Library (opened in May 2019), and the He Matapihi Molesworth Library (opened in October 2019). Neither of the two has the reading rooms or the opening hours of the Central Library, however. A third library is planned for central Wellington, the Brandon Street Library, and is expected to open in early 2020. A new collection and distribution centre to house Wellington Central Library's collection of 400,000 items will be located in Johnsonville and is expected to become fully operational some time in 2020. ==Branches== Wellington City Libraries has 13 branches open to the public: * Arapaki Manners Library * Brooklyn Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Brooklyn) * Cummings Park (Ngaio) Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Korimako, Ngaio) * He Matapihi Molesworth Library * Island Bay Library * Johnsonville Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Waitohi) * Karori Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Te MƒÅhanga) * Khandallah Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Tari-KƒÅkƒÅ) * Mervyn Kemp (Tawa) Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Te Takap≈´) * Miramar Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Motu-Kairangi) * Newtown Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Omaroro) * Ruth Gotlieb (Kilbirnie) Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o Te Awa-a-Taia) * Wadestown Library (Te Whare Pukapuka o ≈åtari)  Arapaki Manners Library  The first pop-up replacement for the now closed Wellington Central Library, Arapaki Manners Library, opened at 12 Manners Street on 28 May 2019.  He Matapihi Molesworth Library  On 27 May 2019, Department of Internal Affairs minister Tracey Martin and National Librarian Bill McNaught announced a partnership between the National Library and Wellington City Council to create a further pop-up space on the ground floor of the Wellington National Library building. On 10 October 2019, this space, named the He Matapihi Molesworth Library, was opened to the public.  Te Awe Library  The third new central city library to replace the Wellington Central Library is planned to go into the Harbour City Centre on Brandon Street. It is expected to open in May 2020.

Dickinson High School in Jersey City.Lin, Jonathan. \\"Akon stops by his Jersey City home away from home\\" , The Jersey Journal, November 17, 2013.

The relationship between Stephens and Akon began as a friendship and mentorship, with the young artist regularly stopping by to ask for advice, with Stephens eventually signing him to his production company and began grooming him professionally. The songs Akon recorded with Stephens were brought to the attention of Universal's imprint SRC Records. In an interview with HitQuarters SRC A&R; Jerome \\"Knobody\\" Foster said, \\"What caught my attention right away was \\"Lonely\\", and I said, 'this kid is official ‚Äì this is a huge record.\\" Foster and SRC CEO Steve Rifkind immediately boarded a private plane to Atlanta to meet the young artist. Akon knew of Foster's work as producer Knobody and so there was a mutual respect for one another and the pair hit it off. Akon's solo debut album, Trouble was released on June 29, 2004. It spawned the singles \\"Locked Up\\", \\"Lonely\\", \\"Belly Dancer (Bananza)\\", \\"Pot of Gold\\" and \\"Ghetto\\". \\"Locked Up\\" reached the number 8 position in the U.S. and number 5 in the UK. \\"Ghetto\\" became a radio hit when it was remixed by DJ Green Lantern to include verses from rappers 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G. The album is a hybrid of Akon's silky, West African-styled vocals mixed with East Coast and Southern beats. Most of Akon's songs begin with the sound of the clank of a jail cell's door with him uttering the word \\"Konvict\\". In 2005, he released the single \\"Lonely\\" (which samples Bobby Vinton's \\"Mr. Lonely\\"). The song reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the charts in Australia, the UK and Germany. His album also climbed to number one in the UK in April 2005. When music channel The Box had a top ten weekly chart, which was calculated by the number of video requests, Akon's \\"Lonely\\" became the longest running single on the top of the chart, spanning over fifteen weeks. Akon was then featured on two other singles, P-Money's \\"Keep on Callin'\\" off the album Magic City, and the other with New Zealand rapper Savage with the single \\"Moonshine\\", which had become a success in both New Zealand and Australia, reaching number one in the New Zealand charts. A year later in 2005, he made his first critically acclaimed guest appearance on Young Jeezy's debut album, Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101, with the song \\"Soul Survivor\\".

At the time, it was said that three square miles of land minutes from the Blaise Diagne International Airport and around 50 kilometres from the capital of Dakar was given to Akon by Senegal president Macky Sall. It is said to be currently under development, and will be the first 100% crypto-based city with Akon's own cryptocurrency, Akoin, at the transactional center. On January 13, 2020, Akon shared on Twitter that the agreements for his city in Senegal have been finalized and the project is underway. He captioned a photo of himself with Senegal president Macky Sall \\"Looking forward to hosting you there in the future.\\" Akon had been planning the crypto-city since 2018. The city plans on trading exclusively in Akon's digital cash, known as Akoin. The city is five minutes away from the Senegal International Airport. In June 2020 it was announced that the engineering and consulting firm KE International (the same firm responsible for building Mwale Medical and Technology City) had been awarded a $6 billion contract to build the city. Phase 1 of construction, which is to be completed in 2023, is to include roads, a hospital, residences, hotels, a police station, a waste facility, a school, and a solar power plant. On September 1, Akon laid the first stone of the $6 billion city. Speaking four days after the death of actor Chadwick Boseman, who starred in the film, Black Panther, Akon stated that he was partially inspired by the film in his desire to teach African-Americans in the diaspora about African culture.

Legal difficulties Akon has stated that he was part of an auto-theft ring and spent four years in prison from 1999 to 2002. However, in April 2008, The Smoking Gun website challenged his claim with court records and interviews with detectives involved in Akon's case, concluding that he was not convicted of any crime and did not serve time in prison.Akon's Con Job , The Smoking Gun, April 16, 2008. Akon responded to the report by saying that he never spent 3 years in prison, but had many shorter sentences that add up to three years.

Amid criticism on the radio, television, and from the blogosphere, Verizon Wireless removed ringtones featuring Akon's songs. Verizon also decided not to sponsor The Sweet Escape Tour where Akon was to be the opening act for Gwen Stefani.Leeds, Jeff. Verizon Drops Pop Singer From Ads , New York Times, May 10, 2007. However, Universal Music Group did not take action against Akon, but rather simply ordered the video clip be removed from video- sharing site YouTube due to copyright infringement.

On June 3, 2007, at WSPK's KFEST concert at the Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, New York, a concert attendee threw an object towards Akon on stage. Akon asked the crowd to identify who threw the object and that he be brought on stage. Security staff grabbed the young man and took him up to the stage. Akon then pulled him up from the crowd and hoisted him across his shoulders. The singer then tossed the attendee back into the crowd from his shoulders. Video of the incident was reviewed by Fishkill police.Police: Akon investigation continues , Poughkeepsie Journal, August 29, 2007. Akon has claimed that the incident was staged and that he in fact used the act to set up for the next record.

Williams, and Akon was arraigned on the two charges on December 3, 2007 in the town of Fishkill Court.Akon Faces Charges, Poughkeepsie Journal, November 30, 2007. In 2010, Buddhist groups in Sri Lanka vehemently protested a planned concert by Akon, claiming his music video with Guetta for \\"Sexy Chick\\" insulted Buddhism because of the Buddha statue that can be seen several times in the background.

It is the author's seventh book and is a stand-alone sequel to A Big Boy did it and Ran Away. The book is a tale of the unusual romance between likable thief, half Scottish half Mexican, Zal Innez and D.I. Angelique de Xavia, the police officer whose job it is to catch him. Martial arts expert de Xavia is recovering from her recent experiences as told in A Big Boy did it and Ran Away. The book uses a blend of black humour, strong language, violence and references to literary and artistic works such as Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett. == Plot summary == The plot of The Sacred Art of Stealing tells the story of American Zal Innez, a witty and intellectual art-loving thief, who is being blackmailed by crime boss Alessandro Estabol to do one last major job for him. As a warm up to their main heist, Zal and his team of fellow failed artists rob a Glasgow bank of approaching a million pounds. During the raid they use unorthodox methods such as firing itching powder at armed police, carrying fake guns, staging plays and drawing works of art for their hostages to keep casualties to a minimum. During this robbery Zal meets and falls for a woman police officer, Angelique de Xavia, heroine of Brookmyre's previous novel, who is under-appreciated by her bosses. Both police officer and thief become painfully aware of the strong attraction between them and a relationship is formed, despite the fact that they are both fully aware that they are on opposite sides. Zal knows Angelique is after him, and even counts on this knowledge to complete his final job, while Angelique is aware that Zal is playing her, even though she does not want to contemplate what that might imply about his real feelings for her. ==Characters== ; Detective Inspector Angelique de Xavia : Glaswegian police officer and loyal Rangers supporter (despite the fact she is Catholic and her brother is a Celtic fan) who feels isolated as a female Asian police officer. Angelique is justifiably annoyed with the attitudes of her senior colleagues who have publicly stated that her previous heroics were unjustified, despite secretly knowing that she really saved their skins. When she is held hostage by Zal, a strong connection is created between them and throughout the rest of the book she faces the difficulties of pursuing him while at the same time sympathising with his plight. Also appears in Brookmyre's other novels, A Big Boy did it and Ran Away and A Snowball in Hell. ; Zal Innez : Machiavellian former artist and thief who, having deliberately been caught during a robbery he was committing for Alessandro Estobal, finds himself out of jail and working for Estobal's again. Estobal is blackmailing him by threatening to kill Zal's friend, and guardian in prison, Parnell. Zal is a likeable American, who is drawn to Glasgow because his father was Glaswegian. He combines wit with a vast literary and artistic knowledge and appreciation. Later returns in Brookmyre's novel, A Snowball in Hell. ; Alessandro Estobal : Heir to the venerable Estobal crime family. Alsessandro is a young hothead, whose rash methods are frowned on by the rest of the organisation. Alessandro holds a grudge against Zal and his friends who rejected him when he tried to join their crowd, he then had them steal several paintings under the threat of killing Zal's father. Zal intentionally messed the job up to land in jail and as a result Alessandro killed his father. Upon Zal's release from prison Alessandro attempts to coerce him into another robbery, this time by threatening to kill Parnell, a prisoner who helped Zal toughen up both mentally and physically while behind bars. ; \\"American\\" Harry Arthur : Real name Javier Arturo, big-time American gangster and assassin who works for the Estobal family. Harry is very cynical about Alessandro, and believes that he is not up to the job of being the head of the family. As a result, he questions many of Alessandro's plans, including his use of Innez, who Harry (correctly) believes cannot be trusted by them. His nickname is derived from his Mexican origins which Harry appears to be ashamed of, and his desire to put himself across as being 100% American.

Redding. It is a serious full-scale grand opera set in Santa Barbara, California in the \\"Spanish days\\" of 1820; \\"Opera of Early California,\\" The New York Times, July 5, 1909, p. 7 the story and music are colored by \\"Indian\\" (Native American) and Spanish themes. It premiered in Philadelphia at the Metropolitan Opera House on February 25, 1911 \\"American Opera, 'Natoma', Produced. Victor Herbert and Joseph D. Redding's Work Greeted by Big Audience in Philadelphia. Furore after First Act. Highly Colored Climaxes, but Opera Suffers from Amateurish Libretto --Conclusion is Conventional\\" The New York Times, February 26, 1911, p. 8 and was later mounted at the New York Metropolitan Opera House on February 28, 1911. \\"'Natoma' Greeted By Great Audience,\\" The New York Times, March 1, 1911, p. 8 Herbert stated that \\"I have tried to imitate Indian music. But I have used no special Indian theme. Indian themes are all very short and unharmonized. I have tried to get the effect of Indian music without using the thing itself. It is the same with some of the Spanish music which occurs in the score. There is Spanish coloring, but I have taken no special Spanish themes to start with.\\" \\"Victor Herbert's First Serious Opera,\\" October 10, 1910, The New York Times,, p. 9 Natoma was not quite the first American opera to be performed at the Metropolitan Opera--that honor belonged to The Pipe of Desire by composer Frederick Shepherd Converse and librettist George Edward Barton, which premiered March 18, 1910 --and in calling it an \\"American\\" opera, some newspapers quibbled about Herbert's Irish origin. Nevertheless, great anticipation preceded the premiere of this \\"American\\" opera with an English-language libretto, which featured first-rank stars Mary Garden and John McCormack and an unstinted production. (The production, in both Philadelphia and New York, was mounted by the Chicago Grand Opera Company, which did not present it in Chicago because the opera house there was fully booked for the season). Prior to the premiere the Times carried numerous articles, one being a full-page musical analysis quoting portions of the score in musical notation and analyzing their function within the structure of the opera.Aldrich, Richard (1911), \\"Production of the English Opera 'Natoma' by Victor Herbert and Joseph D. Redding, The New York Times, February 26, 1911, p. X7 The opera was, according to Meredith Willson, \\"probably the biggest flop of all time,\\", pp. 49-53. Note: Willson was born in 1902 and is unlikely to have had first-hand knowledge of the incident he relates. although the Chicago production company retained it in its repertoire for three seasons. The Times reported that the audience at the Philadelphia premiere evidenced \\"positive excitement\\" after the first act, but that \\"After the second act, however, which is evidently intended to be the principal feature of the opera, in which the effects are piled one upon another, the audience was curiously apathetic.\\" In New York, the reviewer commented on \\"a fine production\\" and said \\"the management was very much in earnest in its production of 'Natoma,'\\" and that the opera \\"has had an enormous amount of preliminary heralding and puffery, and ... the Opera House was filled with a very large audience.\\" Nevertheless, \\"at the end, the audience seemed wearied and anxious to go.\\" He called the libretto \\"amateurish,\\" the prose \\"bald and conventional,\\" and the lyrics \\"of the bad old operatic kind, constructed on Voltaire's theory that what is too foolish to be said is appropriate to be sung.\\" He spends two paragraphs picking out improbabilities in the plot. He called Herbert's music \\"pointedly and strongly dramatic.\\" He questioned the value of the Indian \\"color,\\" on the grounds that Indian music is not familiar to American ears, :hard and uncouth, difficult and intractable.... Only in two cases has he introduced Indian songs in their original form: in the savage \\"Dagger Dance\\" in the second act and the \\"Hawk Song\\" that Natoma sings in the third. Mr. Herbert has been ingenious in his use of the Indian elements, to make their rhythmic and melodic characteristics count for their utmost. It may be that they count for too much. There is undoubtedly a monotony in their frequent repetition.... In some of his music written in neither Indian nor Spanish idioms Mr. Herbert is less fortunate. Some of them have slipped too easily from his pen, and there is the flavor of comic opera about them. In Meredith Willson's account--his having been born in 1902, presumably not at first hand-- :Oh, the lucky, lucky few thousands who were able to beg, steal, or forge tickets to the Metropolitan on that gala night! And of course the plans for the reception after the undoubted triumph included every kind of caviar, pheasant, and dignitary under glass that could possibly be squeezed into the banquet room at the Friar's Club.... The disaster became apparent early in the first act, and by the intermission all the people who were able to attend the reception... were clutching at their bosoms in agony, knowing they couldn't possibly go to this reception and that they couldn't possibly not go.... :The opera got worse clear down to the last curtain, which finally fell, like the hopes of the customers praying for a last-minute miracle. In Willson's telling the situation was saved by Chauncey Depew, who made a speech in which he pulled out some clippings, saying it was appropriate to \\"read these reviews.\\" Everyone froze in his chair as he read review after review saying things like \\"what happened last night was neither opera nor drama,\\" \\"the performance was disgraceful and never should have been allowed,\\" before revealing to the horrified audience that the reviews he was reading were not of Natoma, but actual reviews of the first performance of Bizet's Carmen. He saved the situation, but Willson opined that \\"It would have taken the great Manitou himself to have saved Natoma.\\" As a result of the research and processing of manuscript score and performing parts by Glen Clugston and Peter Hilliard, a first published edition of the opera is now available. A three-day event culminating in a July 13, 2014 reading of the complete opera using the first published edition was produced under the auspices of VHRP LIVE!

Protopopov became a leading liberal politician in Russia after the Russian Revolution of 1905 and elected to the State Duma with the Octobrist Party. Protopopov was appointed Minister of the Interior with the support of Empress Alexandra during World War I, but his inexperience and mental instability failed to relieve the effects of the war on Russia and contributed to the decline of the Imperial government. Protopopov remained Minister of the Interior despite attempts to remove him for his policy failures, worsening mental state, and close relationship with Grigori Rasputin until he was forced to resign shortly before the February Revolution. According to Bernard Pares \\"[Protopopov] was merely a political agent; but his intentions as to policy, considering the post which he held, are of historical interest.\\" == Early life == Alexander Dmitrievich Protopopov was born on 18 December 1866 in Simbirsk (the home of both Alexander Kerensky and Vladimir Lenin), the son of a wealthy member of the local nobility who owned extensive land holdings and a textile factory. Protopopov attended the select Nickolaev Cavalry School as a cadet before being commissioned into the Horse Grenadier Regiment of the Imperial Guard. After leaving the army in 1889, Protopopov studied law and became a director of his father's textile factory. At some point, Protopopov moved to Saint Petersburg where he became active in the financial community.Ronald C. Moe (2011) \\"Prelude to the Revolution. The murder of Rasputin\\", p. 470. ==Political career== Protopopov was elected in 1907 as a member of the centralist Octobrist Party as a delegate to both the Third and Fourth Dumas. In 1912, Protopopov was elected Marshal of Nobility of Karsunsky Uyezd. In 1916, was elected as Marshal of Simbirsk Governorate and also became president of the Council of the Metal- Working Industry, controlled by banks dependent on German syndicates. In November 1913 or May 1914, Protopopov was appointed as vice-president of the Imperial Duma under Mikhail Rodzianko, serving as Deputy Speaker from 1914 to 1916. Protopopov founded a newspaper Russkaya Volya (\\"The Will of Russia\\") which was financed by the banks and appointed Nikolay Gredeskul and Alexander Amfiteatrov as journalists.The newspaper continued after the February Revolution, attacking the Bolsheviks and supporting the Allied cause. It was closed down on 25 October 1917 by the Military Committee. [] According to Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Protopopov was hospitalized from the end of 1915 for six full months in the clinic of Peter Badmayev.The Complete Wartime Correspondence of Tsar Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra, p. 4. April 1914-March 1917 by Joseph T. Fuhrmann, ed.; J.T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin, p. 177 In Spring 1916, at the request of Rodzianko, Protopopov led a delegation of Duma members with Pavel Milyukov to strengthen the ties with the Entente powers, Russia's western allies in World War I. Protopopov met with the German industrialist and politician Hugo Stinnes, the banker Fritz M. Warburg, and the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Knut Wallenberg.The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia by Professor and Holder of the John Biggs Chair in Military History, p. 549. Protopopov faced a violently hostile reception from the pro-British Russian liberals upon his return from France and the United Kingdom, and in self-defence alleged that Warburg had initiated the talks.Ron Chernow (1993) The Warburgs. A family saga, p. 178-179 Protopopov's secret contacts on peace and a swap between Russia and Germany became a scandal, which according to The New York Times was an indication of the rapprochement between the Russian and German Governments. Protopopov was widely suspected of contacts with German diplomat Hellmuth Lucius von Stoedten.THE GREAT RUSSIAN REVOLUTION BY VICTOR CHERNOV; Ronald C. Moe (2011) \\"Prelude to the Revolution.

A family saga, p. 179, 236, 272) Minister of Interior Alexander Protopopov and two aides, September 1916 On 20 July 1916, Protopopov formally met with Tsar Nicholas II who described him as \\"a man I like very much\\". Alexander Kerensky had described him as \\"handsome, elegant, captivating .... moderately liberal and always pleasant\\". Repeatedly, Empress Alexandra urged her husband to appoint Protopopov as Minister of the Interior as placing the vice-president of the Duma in a key post might improve the relations between the Duma and the monarchy.The Complete Wartime Correspondence of Tsar Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra. April 1914-March 1917, p. 5. by Joseph T. Fuhrmann, ed. Although impressed by Protopopov's charm, Nicholas was initially doubtful about his suitability for a position that included responsibility for police and food supplies at a time of instability and shortages. Protopopov had no bureaucratic experience and knew little of the police department. However, the Tsar approved his appointment as manager of the Ministry of Interior some time between 16 and 20 September 1916. According to Richard Pipes, Protopopov received carte blanche to run the country. Although earlier considered fairly liberal, Protopopov saw his new role as that of preserving Tsarist autocracy. With the Tsar absent at the Stavka headquarters, the government of Russia appeared managed as a kind of personal concern between the Empress, Grigori Rasputin and Protopopov, with the auxiliary assistance of Anna Vyrubova.B. Pares (1939), p. 416. Protopopov continued the reactionary policies of his predecessor, Boris St√ºrmer, with support from the Empress. According to Rodzianko and Bernard Pares, by this point Protopopov was mentally unstable and his speeches were incohesive. \\"In spite of his planning on paper, he seems never to have had any effective proposal for the solution of any of the grave and critical problems which he was there to settle.\\"Bernard Pares (1939) The Fall of the Russian Monarchy. A Study of the Evidence. Jonathan Cape. London.p. 382. In October, Protopopov proposed to let a group of Petrograd bankers purchase all the Russian bread and distribute it through the country. Protopopov ordered the release of Vladimir Sukhomlinov, the former Minister of War who was arrested in a high-profile scandal regarding allegations of high treason and abuse of power, and accused responsibility for Russia's numerous early defeats in World War I.O. Figes (1996), p. 286. When the Russian public learned Protopopov had visited the now-destitute and despised Sukhomlinov at his apartment, he was heavily criticized in the Duma and damaged the reputation of the government. Protopopov intended to suppress public organizations, especially Zemgor and the War Industry Committees, to win back the support of the business world, which he knew better than anything else.B. Pares (1939), p. 418. In November, Protopopov sought the dissolution of the Duma.B. Pares, p. 442. Alexander Trepov, the new prime minister, informed Protopopov that he wished him to give up his post in the Ministry of the Interior and take over that of Commerce, but Protopopov refused. In November 1916, Trepov made the dismissal of Protopopov an indispensable condition of his accepting the presidency of the Council. The Empress, who disliked Trepov, tried to retain Protopopov in his influential position in the Ministry of the Interior.The Fall of the Russian Empire: The Story of the Last of the Romanovs and ... by Edmund A. Walsh S.J., p. 115, 116, 297. On 14 November 1916 (O.S.), Trepov travelled to the Stavka to meet with the Tsar to discuss the growing crisis caused by World War I, but threatened to resign on the next day. On 17 November, Nikolai Pokrovsky was appointed as a foreign minister, but announced his resignation four times over disagreements with Protopopov. Pokrovsky favored the attraction of the American financial capital into the Russian economy. On 7 December, the cabinet demanded that Protopopov should go to the Tsar and resign, but he was instead appointed as Minister at the request of the Tsarina.B. Pares (1939), p. 396. In December 1916, Protopopov banned the zemstvos from meeting without police agents in attendance.B. Pares (1939), p. 428. \\"Protopopov felt that this organization was dominated by a revolutionary salaried staff and that in general the demand of opposition activists for a role in food-supply matters was meant to further political, and not practical, aims.\\"Lars T. Lih (1990) Bread and Authority in Russia, 1914‚Äì1921 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS When the supply problems proved beyond Protopopov's capabilities to manage, he lifted registration requirements on Jewish residents of Moscow and other cities.Jewish Policies and Right-wing Politics in Imperial Russia by Hans Rogger Protopopov was frequently treated by Peter Badmayev, a quack doctor close to the Russian imperial family. ==Relations with Rasputin== Grigori Rasputin had a closer relationship with Protopopov than with his predecessor St√ºrmer, and had known each other since 1912. B. Pares, p. 380. Protopopov was suffering from the effects of advanced syphilis which made him physically weak and mentally unstable, and resulted in a mystical and deeply superstitious condition. Protopopov was a frequent visitor to Peter Badmayev and Rasputin for treatment. On the evening of 16 December 1916, Protopopov urged Rasputin not to visit Felix Yusupov that night.B. Pares (1939), p. 405; Maria Rasputin (1934) My Father, p. 109. Rasputin however disregarded this advice and was murdered at the Yusopov Palace in St. Petersburg a few hours later. It is alleged that Protopopov subsequently sought advice from the dead Rasputin at seances. ==Revolution and death== On February 22, the workers of most of the big factories were on strike. On International Women's Day, working women came out in the streets to demonstrate against starvation, war, and tsardom. On 25 February 1917, during a session of the Council of Ministers, Pokrovsky proposed the resignation of the whole government. The next day, Protopopov and Nikolay Iudovich Ivanov, the Commander of the Petrogradsky Military District, tried to suppress the February Revolution. However, Protopopov ignored warnings from the Tsar's secret police, the Okhrana, that the ill-disciplined and poorly trained troops of the Petrograd garrison were unreliable. The reservist battalions of four regiments of the Imperial Guard then mutinied and joined the revolutionaries. Pokrovsky reported about his negotiations with the Progressive Bloc led by Vasili Maklakov at the session of the Council of Ministers in the Mariinsky Palace, who spoke for the resignation of the government, but Protopopov refused to give up. On the 27th, the Duma was dissolved and Protopopov was proclaimed dictator. Not long after his apartment and office were sacked by demonstrators, and Protopopov took refuge at the Marie Palace. According to M. Nelipa: \\"On February 28, Protopopov freely walked into the Tauride Palace at 11.00 p.m. and handed himself in.\\"Margarita Nelipa (2010) The Murder of Grigorii Rasputin. A Conspiracy That Brought Down the Russian Empire, p. 450. Gilbert's Books. .https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19170523.2.60 Protopopov was taken to the main hall, where the former cabinet ministers were surrounded by soldiers with fixed bayonets. The new Russian Provisional Government under Georgy Lvov requested him to retire from his post as Minister of the Interior, giving him the plea of \\"illness\\" if he desired.B. Pares, p. 451. Protopopov and Prince Golitsyn were arrested and taken to the Peter and Paul fortress that night. In prison, Protopopov prepared detailed affidavits concerning his period in office, but he was soon taken to a military hospital suffering from hallucinations. After the October Revolution in November 1917 and the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, Protopopov was transferred to Moscow and imprisoned in Taganka Prison. On 27 October 1918, Protopopov was executed by the Cheka, with his execution order implying his declining mental state as the main reason. ==References External links == * V.I. Gurko.

Bilko is a 1996 American comedy film directed by Jonathan Lynn and written by Andy Breckman. It is an adaptation of the 1950s television series The Phil Silvers Show, often informally called Sgt. Bilko, or simply Bilko, and stars Steve Martin, Dan Aykroyd, and Phil Hartman. ==Plot== Master Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko is in charge of the motor pool at Fort Baxter, a small United States Army base that develops new military technology. Exploiting this position, he directs a number of scams, ranging from gambling to renting out military vehicles. His commanding officer, Colonel John Hall, overlooks Bilko's money-making schemes, as he is more concerned with problems in the hovertank that the base is designing. Major Colin Thorn, an officer from the U.S. Army Inspector General's office, arrives at the camp and begins to scrutinize Bilko's record. Officially, Thorn is at Fort Baxter to conduct a general inspection and determine if the base should remain open in light of recent defense cutbacks. He is also determined to get revenge on Bilko to settle an old score the two have from Fort Dix, where Thorn was nearly court- martialed after a fixed boxing match which resulted in Thorn being shipped off to Greenland in the belief that he tried to fix the fight. Bitter and unprincipled, Thorn is not above breaking the law to ruin Bilko. He attempts to steal Bilko's long-time fianc√©e Rita, whom Bilko has stood up at the altar more than a dozen times. Rita is tired of waiting and gives Bilko 30 days to win her back or lose her for good. Bilko, with the help of newly assigned Private First Class Wally Holbrook, devises a means of avoiding Thorn's attempt to transfer him to Greenland: He rigs a demonstration of the base's malfunctioning hovertank, staged before a four-star general and numerous dignitaries. Since Thorn had deliberately tried to sabotage the tank the previous night, he confronts Bilko, Hall, and the general, loudly insulting Bilko and Hall. While ranting, he confesses to sabotaging the hovertank. Thorn is sent off again to Greenland. The last day of Rita's ultimatum has come. Just as she sadly begins to write Bilko off forever, Rita hears men outside her house, serenading her with a favorite song of hers and Bilko's. Looking out, she sees Bilko and his platoon. Bilko asks Rita to marry him, and she accepts. The next day is their wedding day, but Rita shows up late, due to a mix-up over Daylight Saving Time. After they play another card game, they finally get married. Unknown to Bilko, Rita is holding four aces in her hand. ==Cast== *Steve Martin as Master Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko *Dan Aykroyd as Col.

He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Norfolk for 27 years. ==Early life== Howell was born in Great Moulton in Norfolk, the son of a farmer. He was educated at Diss Grammar School, Norfolk. He joined the RAF in 1941, becoming a navigator and bomb aimer. He was demobilised as a flight lieutenant in 1946, and became an arable farmer, later chairing the local branch of the National Farmers Union. He married Margaret Bone in 1950. His wife died in 2005. He was survived by their daughter and two sons. ==Political career== He joined the Conservative Party, and was councillor for Mitford and Launditch Rural District Council from 1961. He stood for Parliament in North Norfolk at the 1966 general election, but could not displace the incumbent Labour MP, Bert Hazell. He won the seat at the 1970 general election, and his assiduous constituency work enabled him to retain the seat for the next 27 years with increasing majorities.The Telegraph His politics were considered to fall on the right wing of his party, supporting compulsory National Service, reintroduction of the death penalty, tax cuts, reduction of the public sector, stronger controls on immigration rules, and the introduction of identity cards. He was a proponent of the adoption of a \\"workfare\\" system of unemployment benefits, to encourage unemployed people to find jobs. His book, Why Work?, was published in 1976, followed by Why Not Work? (1991) and Putting Britain Back to Work (1995). He served on several backbench committees, and on the executive of the 1922 Committee from 1984 to 1990. In 1996, he introduced the Right to Work Bill, which proposed the state as the employer of last resort for the unemployed. Howell was a nominated member of the European Parliament from 1974 to 1979, and a delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union from 1987 to 1997. He was knighted in 1993. His elder son, Paul Howell, was elected as an MEP for Norfolk from 1979 to 1994. He retired from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election. His seat was retained by the Conservative David Prior, the son of one of Howell's political opponents, \\"wet\\" Conservative cabinet minister Jim Prior. ==References== *Times Guide to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Limited, 1992 edition. *Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 17 February 2008 *Obituary, The Independent, 23 February 2008 *Obituary, The Times, 28 February 2008 * Obituary, The Guardian, 5 March 2008 == External links == * Category:1923 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1970‚Äì1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974‚Äì1979 Category:UK MPs 1979‚Äì1983 Category:UK MPs 1983‚Äì1987 Category:UK MPs 1987‚Äì1992 Category:UK MPs 1992‚Äì1997 Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Councillors in Norfolk Category:Conservative Party (UK) MEPs Category:MEPs for the United Kingdom 1973‚Äì1979 Category:People educated at Diss Grammar School Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II Category:Politicians awarded knighthoods ","title":"Ralph Howell"},{"id":"5570754","text":"A terricolous lichen is a lichen that grows on the soil as a substrate.

The race was very closely run and Half Caste won by only a short neck from Jean Du Quesne. == Breeding and ownership == According to George Edwin Collins, \\"Nimrod junior\\", in his 1902 book \\"History of the Brocklesby hounds, 1700-1901\\", Half Caste was bred by Mr. W. Marris (of Limber, Lincolnshire) and was then purchased by Mr. F. E. Epworth (of Great Coates, Lincolnshire) - both members of the Brocklesbury Hunt \\\\- who sold him on to Samuel Brisco Sheward, the leading society horsedealer from 43a Green Street, Mayfair, London. The General Stud Book confirms he had been foaled in 1853 by Morgan Rattler, dam by Beiram, by W. Marris. John Gerard Leigh‚Ä≤s obituary states that Half Caste was one of the first two steeplechasers he had owned, and was bought by him for 500 Guineas (¬£500) from Samuel Brisco Sheward, described as his ‚Ä≤fidus Achates‚Ä≤ (faithful friend), who was his normal supplier of horses and represented him officially for racing purposes. John Gerard Leigh of Luton Hoo was a major (but very discreet at the time) steeplechaser owner. == Career == He was entered in the 1859 Grand National under the name of Mr Willoughby, a nom de course of John Gerard Leigh, and was ridden by his trainer Chris Green. The Era reported that Half Caste looked \\"wonderfully fit\\" and had \\"improved immensely under Green's management\\" at the parade. The Morning Post, though, thought that the gelding \\"was not very taking in his appearance\\" but noted he was the only horse to have escaped from an outbreak of (equine) influenza that had swept through Chris Green's stable. The race saw one of the closest finishes to a National in history with only ten lengths separating the first six horses to finish. Half Caste beat French raider, Jean Du Quesne, by a short neck, winning in a time of 10 minutes 2 seconds, and The Huntsman finished third. Half Caste only competed in the Grand National once but The Huntsman went on to win the race himself in 1862. Half Caste is officially recorded as having started as the 7/1 second favourite for the race, but according to some contemporary newspaper reports, for instance The Era, he was listed as starting at 100/15. The day after his victory, Half Caste also went down with influenza and was put under the care of Mr Lucas, a veterinary surgeon of Liverpool. The horse was \\"perfectly prostrate\\" and \\"serious doubts were entertained as to his recovery\\". Memorial plaque to Half Caste, the winner of the 1859 Grand National at Aintree, in a wall at Apes (or Aps) Hall, Littleport, Cambridgeshire, UK Half Caste's 1859 Grand National victory was by far his greatest. He only ran once in 1858 (in the Windsor Town Plate on 12 November where he did not perform) and the record also shows that, after his National win, he was only entered for a couple of less important races in 1859 (The Londesborough Great Steeple Chase Handicap, York in April and The Severn Bank Steeple Chase in October). There then seems to be a long gap until he paid the stakes for entry to the 1861 Grand National, for which he was not fancied but he was withdrawn at the last moment and apparently never raced again. == Retirement == At some later point, presumably through the agency of Chris Green who had ridden for, and co-owned horses with, him, Half Caste was acquired by Henry Jones of Aps (or Apes) Hall, Littleport, Isle of Ely (Henry Jones built up one of the best small racehorse studs in the late Victorian period.) for breeding but he produced no progeny of note. He was buried in the orchard of Apes Hall and a stone plaque to his memory is incorporated in a wall here. == Depictions == No written description of Half Caste exists, but he was painted by Henry Barraud in 1859. No publicly available image of this painting has been found but a contemporary image of Half Caste with Chris Green up is held by one of Chris Green's descendants and this may be based on this. The original was sold by Sotheby's, London on 18 July 1979. == References == Category:1853 racehorse births Category:National Hunt racehorses Category:Grand National winners Category:Thoroughbred family 3-j Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom ","title":"Half Caste (horse)"},{"id":"5570773","text":"Mathematics education in Australia in upper Secondary School varies considerably between various states due to the different education systems in place in each state. ==New South Wales== Higher School Certificate The Higher School Certificate (HSC) in NSW contains a number of mathematics courses catering for a range of abilities. There are four courses offered by NESA (NSW Education Standards Authority ) for HSC Study: *Mathematics Standard 1 or 2: A basic mathematics course containing precalculus concepts; the course is heavily based on practical mathematics used in everyday life.NSW Mathematics Standard Syllabus While the more advanced courses include statistical topics, this is the only course which introduces normal distributions, standard deviations and z-scores. These topics are alluded to in more advanced courses though not formally considered. *Mathematics Advanced: An advanced level calculus-based course with detailed study in probability and statistics, trigonometry, curve sketching, and applications of calculus. It is the highest level non-extension mathematics course.NSW Mathematics Advanced Syllabus While the calculus is only a single variable in all of year 12 mathematics in NSW, in this course students are able to calculate volumes of revolution for a select class of functions. Computational methods such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule are encountered for evaluating integrals. The course includes a brief foray into series and sequences, including an application to basic finance through the modelling of compound interest. The nature of lines, circles and parabolas as loci are investigated however these properties are not exploited by the plane geometry coursework. Quadratic equations are studied and students learn techniques to reduce special quintic and exponential equations to quadratics. *Mathematics Extension 1 (Must be studied concurrently with Mathematics Advanced): A more advanced course building on concepts in calculus, trigonometry, polynomials, basic combinatorics, vectors, and further statistics. NSW Mathematics Extension 1 Syllabus Students learn the binomial theorem to extend their knowledge of probability, along with using circle geometry to prove a greater family of statements. The trigonometry component includes double-angle identities and factoring the addition of a sine and cosine function into a single sinusoid. In calculus students are exposed to a greater variety of integration techniques such as substitution. Parametrization of planar curves is introduced, mainly focusing on lines, circles and parabolas. The plotting of cubic equations and solution of specific cases through polynomial long division and the remainder theorem enable a deeper understanding of polynomials. *Mathematics Extension 2 (Must be studied concurrently with Mathematics Advanced and Mathematics Extension 1): A highly advanced mathematics course containing an introduction to complex numbers, advanced calculus, motion, and further work with vectors.NSW Mathematics Extension 2 Syllabus While NSW Mathematics curricula does not include matrix theory nor group theory, the geometric properties of complex numbers alludes to both of these. The former is hinted at in the multiplicative properties of complex numbers, as students are required to plot the products, sums and quotients of complex numbers on the Argand plane. While group theory is not explicitly mentioned, roots of unity and cyclic groups are extensively studied. With their newfound familiarity with complex numbers, the fundamental theorem of algebra can now be formally stated. Students are now able to exploit this closure to solve even more polynomial equations. Recursive integral sequences, integration by parts and partial fraction decomposition techniques allow the solution to a wider class of problems. Projectile motion is studied in the kinematics module, which surpasses the depth of study found in HSC physics. This course synergizes with HSC Physics, as students are able to apply this knowledge in their Physics exams to arrive at more elegant and efficient solutions. The parametrisation of lines, circles and parabolas in Mathematics Extension 1 is further developed to the entire family of conics, including degenerate cases. Students are exposed to rectangular hyperbolas, however hyperbolic trigonometric functions are not included. Despite this students are expected to adapt to novel material, such as proving properties of the catenary via it's expression in exponential functions. The defining feature of content progression from Mathematics Advanced through to Extension 2 Mathematics is the level of Mathematical Maturity expected of students. In higher courses students have exposure to a greater breadth and depth of techniques, and are expected to synthesize knowledge from seemingly disparate topics. In Mathematics Advanced exams students may be asked to apply familiar techniques to unfamiliar contexts, such as being given an identity through which they must solve a problem. Further mathematical maturity is vital to success in Extension 2 exams, as assessment focuses on both conceptual understanding and computational abilities. The difficulty in HSC final exam questions generally increases throughout the course of the paper. In one Extension 2 HSC examination, the final question provides students with a series of prompts and smaller questions, which culminate in a proof of the Basel Problem. ==Victoria== Victorian Certificate of Education The Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) mathematics subjects are designed to cater for the varying abilities and aptitudes of Victorian students. There are four courses offered for VCE study:VCE Mathematics Study Design Units 1-4: 2006-2009 (PDF) *Foundation Mathematics (2 units): Very basic, practical maths skills are taught in this strand, which is only run at a Unit 1 + 2 level. *Further Mathematics (4 Units): Further Mathematics is considered to be the second-least demanding of the four maths subjects and is the \\"standard\\" maths course taken by Victorian students. It deals with topics including basic algebra, matrices, trigonometry, straight line geometry, business-related mathematics and other concepts *Mathematical Methods (CAS) (4 Units): Mathematical Methods is the most common non-compulsory prerequisite for tertiary study in Victoria. Methods deals with concepts including differential calculus, integral calculus, circular functions, probability and the behaviour of functions with a single real variable, incorporating the use of computer algebra system technology (CAS) throughout the course. *Specialist Mathematics (4 Units): Specialist Mathematics is considered the most advanced high school mathematics subject in Victoria. The subject covers concepts including conic sections, complex numbers, differential equations, kinematics, vector calculus and mechanics. The idea behind Specialist Mathematics is to integrate already learnt concepts of calculus into other fields of mathematics, thus giving Specialist Mathematics a far more practical orientation than standard mathematical subjects. In addition to the regular mathematics courses offered in VCE, a new subject called Algorithmics (Higher Education Scored Study) began its coursework in 2015.VCE Algorithmics Study Design Units 3-4: 2015-2016 (PDF) Since it is a fully scored subject supported by members in both the University of Melbourne and Monash University, it is different from University Extension studies. Beginning with definitions of abstract data types and algorithms, this subject explores the concepts of pseudocode, sorting, common graph algorithms, recursion, algorithm design patterns, algorithm analysis and computational complexity theory. ==Queensland== In Queensland, the senior (years 11 and 12) curriculum is divided into three parts: Maths A, Maths B, and Maths C. Mathematics A Maths A covers more practical topics than Maths B and C, but it is still OP eligible. There are considerably fewer algebraic concepts in this subject, and it is suitable for students who either struggled with mathematics in Year 10, or who do not require a knowledge of abstract mathematics in the future. Maths A is designed to help students to develop an appreciation of the value of Mathematics to humanity. Students learn how mathematical concepts may be applied to a variety of life situations including business and recreational activities. The skills encountered are relevant to a vast array of careers (trade, technical, business etc.). Assessments in the subject include both formative and summative written tests, assignments and practical work. It is assessed in the categories: Knowledge & Procedures (KAPS); Modelling & Problem Solving (MAPS); Communication & Justification (CAJ). Although Maths A is not a pre-requisite subject, but it is sufficient for entrance to many tertiary courses.Mathematics A syllabus (PDF) The course is divided into four semesters. The skills learned in each semester are as follows: Semester 1 (Year 11/Form 5): * Data Analysis * Managing Money * Applied Geometry * Linking 2 and 3 Dimensions Semester 2 (Year 11/Form 5): * Land Measurement * Applied Geometry * Statistics * Managing Money Semester 3 (Year 12/Form 6): * Managing Money * Land Measurement * Data Analysis * Operations Research Semester 4 (Year 12/Form 6): * Statistics * Land Measurement * Navigation * and an elective topic on Data Mathematics B Maths B is considerably more theoretical than Maths A, requiring advanced algebra skills to successfully complete. It is a common prerequisite for science and engineering courses at Queensland Universities. Maths B (in some schools) can be studied at the same time with either Maths A or Maths C, but not both. Maths B gives students an understanding of the methods and principles of mathematics and the ability to apply them in everyday situations and in purely mathematical contexts; the capacity to model actual situations and deduce properties from the model; an interest and ability in framing and testing mathematical hypotheses; the ability to express and communicate any results obtained; some knowledge of the history of mathematics; encouragement to think independently and creatively. Assessments are similar as those of Maths A, which includes both formative (Semester 1) and summative (Semesters 2,3 and 4) written tests, assignments and post-assignment tests. It is also assessed in the three categories Knowledge & Procedures (KAP); Modelling & Problem Solving (MAP); Communication & Justification (CAJ). Maths B is a pre-requisite for any tertiary course which deals with or uses math and/or science.Mathematics B syllabus (PDF) According to the Queensland Studies Authority, in 2010, 93% of students who studied Maths B were OP eligible. The course is divided into four (4) semesters. The skills learned each semester are as follows: Semester 1 (Year 11/Form 5): * Functions (Linear, Quadratic, Absolute Value) * Periodic Functions (Trigonometry, Sin/Cosine Functions) * Applied Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Lie Factor) * Applied Statistics 2 (Linear/Quadratic Regression, Residual Plots) Semester 2 (Year 11/Form 5): * Exploring Data / Statistics * Indices and Logarithms/ Exponential Functions * Limits and Differential Calculus 1 Semester 3 (Year 12/Form 6): * Exponential and Log Functions * Optimization Using Derivatives * Integration * Integral Calculus Semester 4 (Year 12/Form 6): * Applied Statistical Analysis * Integration * Differential Calculus 2 * Optimisation (Other Methods) Mathematics C Maths C extends the topics taught in Maths B, and covers additional pure-maths topics (including complex numbers, matrices, vectors, further calculus and number theory). Although not necessarily more difficult, it must be studied in conjunction with Maths B. Maths C gives the students an understanding of the methods and principles of mathematics and the ability to apply them in everyday situations and in purely mathematical contexts; the capacity to model actual situations and deduce properties from the model; an interest and ability in framing and testing mathematical hypotheses; the ability to express and communicate any results obtained; some knowledge of the history of mathematics; encouragement to think independently and creatively. Assessments are in the same as the other two courses, formative and summative written tests, assignments and practical work. The student is assessed in the areas of Knowledge & Procedures (KAPS); Modelling & Problem Solving (MAPS); Communication & Justification (CAJ). Maths C can be a pre-requisite to tertiary courses with a heavy maths/science basis. Some skills learned in Maths C would be found in business and economics degrees.Mathematics C syllabus (PDF) The course is divided into four (4) semesters. The areas learned are in the following: Semester 1 (Year 11/Form 5): * Real and Complex Numbers * Matrices * Vectors * Groups * Structures & Patterns Semester 2 (Year 11/Form 5): * Applications of Matrices * Vectors * Real and Complex Numbers * Dynamics * Structures and Patterns Semester 3 (Year 12/Form 6): * Structures and Patterns * Real and Complex Numbers * Matrices * Periodic Functions * Calculus * Option I & II Semester 4 (Year 12/Form 6): * Vectors * Calculus * Dynamics * Vectors * Option I & II ==Western Australia== New WACE mathematics courses were introduced for Year 11 students in 2015 to replace previous mathematics courses and being the Western Australian course in line with the Australian Curriculum.

He opposed constitutional reforms and was an anti-semite. ==Life== Khvostov was born in a noble family of land proprietors. After finishing the Imperial Alexander Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo, he became a student in Law. In 1898 he married Ekaterina Popova, the daughter of Alexander Popov (1835-1914), a senator. In 1904 he became vice governor of Minsk and later that year was appointed in Tula. In 1906 Khvostov became Vice Governor and then Governor of Nizhny Novgorod. When Pyotr Stolypin was murdered Grigori Rasputin paid him a visit in order of the Tsar \\"to look in his soul\\", but came to the conclusion he was too young to be appointed as minister. Also Count Kokovtsov protested.J.T. Fuhrmann (2013) The Untold Story In 1912 he was elected to the Fourth Imperial State Duma as a member and president of the Russian Assembly, one of the right wing parties. He was Minister of the Interior from September 26, 1915 (Old Style) to March 3, 1916. His uncle Aleksandr Khvostov was opposed to the appointment of his nephew. Khvostov in his office as Minister of Interior After Khvostov came into office he began to intrigue against his colleagues, against the Prime Minister himself in order to get his place, and finally against his benefactor Rasputin. Khvostov and Iliodor concocted a plan to kill Rasputin. Khvostov had come to the conclusion that Rasputin was a German spy or agent.A. Kerensky (1965) Russia and History's turning point, p. 160. Evidence that Rasputin actually worked for the Germans is flimsy at best.G. King (1994) The Last Empress. The Life & Times of Alexandra Feodorovna, tsarina of Russia , p. 258. In his efforts to plot against Rasputin (and not becoming Prime Minister) Khvostov had to resign.Fuhrmann (2013) The Untold Story, p. 164-165. After Boris St√ºrmer, his uncle Aleksandr Khvostov, became his successor. Khvostov was arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress by the Russian Provisional Government during the February Revolution of 1917. In 1918, less than a year after the Bolsheviks seized power he was executed by firing squad in Petrovsky Park, Moscow. ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Imperial Russian politicians Category:Interior ministers of Russia Category:Members of the State Duma (Russian Empire) Category:Victims of Red Terror in Soviet Russia Category:Russian monarchists Category:Executed Russian people Category:People executed by Russia by firing squad ","title":"Alexei Khvostov"},{"id":"5570797","text":"The Privy Council of Thailand (, khana ongkhamontri thai) is a body of appointed advisors to the Monarchy of Thailand. The council, as the Constitution of Thailand stipulates, must be composed of no more than eighteen members. The council is led by the president of the Privy Council of Thailand; currently occupied by former Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont since 27 May 2019. The king alone appoints all members of the council. The council's offices are in the Privy Council Chambers, Phra Nakhon District, Bangkok. In recent years the council and its president in particular, have been accused of interfering in politics. This stems from the council's closeness to the military, in particular during the 2006 Thai coup d'√©tat. General Prem was reappointed president of the privy council by the King Maha Vajiralongkorn on 2 December 2016, although in 2018 the office was stripped of some of its powers. ==History== King Chulalongkorn based the first privy council on European models. The first privy council in Siam was established by a royal decree on 8 May 1874, by King Chulalongkorn (or Rama V). The king, educated by Westerners, was keen on copying the system of government of the absolute monarchs of Europe. At first he created two councils: the \\"Privy Council of Siam\\" (; ) (49 members) and the \\"Council of State\\" (; ) (12 members, name later changed to \\"Council of Ministers\\" (; )). The privy council was created to deal with legislative affairs while the latter became an early version of the cabinet. Chulalongkorn was succeeded by his son King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) in 1910, who at the beginning of his reign appointed a 40-member \\"Privy Council of State\\" (; ). The king, during his 15 years on the throne, would continue to appoint new members at Thai New Year (or 4 April). When he died in 1925 the privy council was composed of 233 members. King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) who succeeded his brother in 1925, completely overhauled the system and created instead three councils: The \\"Supreme Council of State of Siam\\" (; ) (composed of five senior princes, equivalent to the former Council of State); The \\"Council of Secretaries\\" (; ) (former Council of Ministers); and the Privy Council of State. The role of the Privy Council was relegated to minor legislative affairs, while the Supreme Council became Prajadhipok's main body of advisors. On 24 June 1932, a group calling themselves the Khana Ratsadon (or People's Party), together with the military, seized power in Bangkok. They abolished the system of absolute monarchy, changing Siam into a parliamentary constitutional monarchy and demanding of Prajadhipok a constitution for the people of Siam. The king granted them a \\"temporary\\" constitution in the same month and a permanent one in December. The Khana Ratsadon, once in power, abolished the Supreme Council and the Privy Council. They replaced the Council of Secretaries with the People's Committee of Siam. It was not until fifteen years later that the 1947 constitution of Siam recreated the Privy Council under King Bhumibol Adulyadej, with a name change to \\"Supreme Council of State\\" (; ). This council existed from 1947 to 1949 and was composed of: King Rama IX at a meeting of the Privy Council in 1953 * Prince Rangsit Prayurasakdi, Prince of Chainat, President of the council * Prince Dhani Nivat, Prince Bidyalabh Bridhyakon * Prince Alongkot, Prince Adisorn Udomsak * Phraya Manavaratsevi (Plod Vichear na Songkhla) * Police General Adul Aduldejjarus Two years later, under the 1949 Constitution of Thailand, the council was renamed the \\"Privy Council of Thailand\\" (; ) or (; ). The Privy Council in its current form was created by the 2017 Constitution of Thailand. ==Members== The present constitution stipulated that the council is composed of no more than eighteen members. The members of the Privy Council or Privy Councillors are appointed and removed at the pleasure of the king alone, but appointments must be countersigned by the President of the Privy Council.Constitution of Thailand The councillors cannot be partisan and therefore cannot be members of the House of Representatives, Senate of Thailand, Election Commission, Ombudsman, member of the National Human Rights Commission, judge of the Constitutional Court, judge of an Administrative Court, member of the National Counter Corruption Commission, member of the State Audit Commission, a government official holding a permanent position or receiving a permanent salary, an official of a state enterprise, other state official or holder of other position of member or official of a political party, and must not manifest loyalty to any political party. Privy councillors are not prohibited from sitting on the boards of influential companies and, under Prem, some councillors are board members of Bangkok Bank, Charoen Pokphand, the Boonrawd group, and the Charoen Siriwatanapakdi business group. After being appointed the councilors must take the following oath in the presence of the king to assume office: > \\"I, (name of the declarer), do solemnly declare that I will be loyal to His > Majesty the King and will faithfully perform my duties in the interests of > the country and of the people. I will also uphold and observe the > Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in every respect.\\" A councillor vacates office upon death, resignation, or at royal command. President The President of the Privy Council of Thailand is the head and chief councillor of the privy council. The king retains the power to appoint and remove the president, however the President of the National Assembly of Thailand must countersign presidential appointments and removals, unlike other councillors which the king alone decides. ==Functions== The 2017 Constitution gave the privy council many roles and powers. These are mostly associated with the issues surrounding the head of state and the monarchy. A US ambassador described its duties thus, \\"Statutorily they exist to offer advice to the King if he solicits it, review petitions on his behalf, act as ceremonial stand-ins for the King at various royally-sponsored ceremonies, and play a critical role in succession.\\" Regency If the king is incapacitated or for whatever reason and cannot appoint a regent, the privy council will submit to the National Assembly the name of a suitable individual, who must then be approved by a vote. During the period where there is no regent the President of the Privy Council shall be the regent pro tempore. This case is also applicable if the regent is incapacitated and cannot perform his duties. When this happens the President of the Privy Council shall be replaced in his duties to the council by a president pro tempore. Palace Law of Succession In regards to the amendment of the 1924 Palace Law of Succession, the king must ask the privy council to draft an amendment. After the king's approval and signature, the President of the Privy Council will notify the president of the National Assembly that will then countersign such amendment. Vacancy on the throne When the throne becomes vacant it is the duty of the privy council to submit to the cabinet and to the National Assembly the name of the successor to the throne. During this vacancy period (before the submission) the President of the Privy Council will be the regent pro tempore. Other functions Apart from these constitutionally mandated functions the privy councillors also perform other duties. For instance, they carry out other duties in the royal household and on royal projects. Several councillors are members of the Mahidol Foundation, while Dr. Chaovana Nasylvanta is the Director of the Crown Property Bureau. Councillors can, at royal command, attend official functions or carry out official duties on behalf of the king or the royal family. == List of presidents of the Privy Council== { class= - !

The college's origins begin in 1890, when the then newly formed Lancashire County Council set up a sub-committee with the remit of making grants available to help local agriculture. The Chairman of the Farming Sub Committee, Reverend Leonard Charles Wood, was responsible for overseeing the purchase and management of a new educational establishment for agriculture. College buildings (2016) The original college was based at Home Farm near the village of Hutton, south of Preston, and moved to its current site in 1969, as recorded by a stone plaque on the teaching block built at that time. The new college was built on the site of Myerscough Hall, near St Michael's Road in Bilsborrow, and is in the rural parish of Myerscough and Bilsborrow. In 1993 the college was renamed Myerscough College following the passing of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The college occupies the substantial grounds previously occupied by the hall and farm, extending to River Brock on the north side, and St Michael's Road on the south. The college also leases several local farms, including Lee Farm and Lodge Farm, for agricultural research and teaching purposes. The college estate extends to 605 hectares, and the campus has extensive residential accommodation. == Present Day == 30 June 2017 saw the launch of its Higher Education provision, University Centre Myerscough, in partnership with the University of Central Lancashire, who validates the college's degrees. Other centres have also been added in Blackburn, Liverpool, Manchester and Dorset. Each offers a variety of land-based and sport courses. The Myerscough Centre in Dorset, the Lynwood Veterinary Hospital, specialises in veterinary nursing. In September 2006, the college was the setting for former BBC Gardeners' World presenter Christine Walkden's television programme, Christine's Garden. Walkden is a former student at the college, and in the programme she gave advice on how to present and sell produce; and she also reminisced about her time at the college. The shows aired on BBC2 in March 2007. On 11 October 2006, Equine expert Monty Roberts, the inspiration for the Robert Redford film, The Horse Whisperer appeared at the college as part of his \\"The Horses in My Life\\" tour. On 20 February 2007, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex visited the college and toured around the college's agricultural education facilities, where he was said to be very impressed by the welcome he received at the college. And in June 2007, the Bishop of New York, the Right Rev E Don Taylor, spent three days at the college, as part of a two-month sabbatical learning about the mission and ministry of rural communities and churches. ==Study== In 2011 the college had over 7,000 students, of whom 2,500 were full-time, with about 1,000 studying Higher Education. Subjects to study at Myerscough College include arboriculture, agriculture, ecology, countryside management, motorsports, mechanisation, sports and leisure, golf, landscape design, animal care, equine studies, horticulture, sportsturf, photography, and farriery/metalwork. Short courses for industry range from crane handling to crop spraying, and short leisure courses from caravan manoeuvring to floristry. Myerscough has also been in the forefront of developing on-line and blended learning courses for the land-based industries, allowing students to work full or part-time and to study on-line to complete foundation degree and Honour degree programmes. In August 2005, the college announced a partnership with Lancashire County Cricket Club where they would offer students the opportunity to study at the club's indoor cricket centre for a national diploma combining academic studies in sport with practical skill development in cricket. ==Facilities== Myerscough College is home to the National Centre for arboriculture, and is recognised internationally for its specialism in this subject. There is an international equine arena, a nine-hole golf course and simulated golf training centre, the plant centre, an off-road driving track, nine-hole disc golf course, sports fields and a sports centre and gymnasium, as well as an arboretum, woods, fields, ponds and the River Brock on the site. The Frank Peregrine Higher Education Centre was opened in 2006 and extended in 2010. In addition, the college houses the Rural Business Centre, which provides support for rural business in the form of courses, advice, links and the Rural Business Incubator for startup businesses. The sports centre, which cost ¬£1.8M, was opened in 2004, and contains a golf studio. In May 2007, the college opened a milking parlour at Lodge Farm which can facilitate 50 cows at one time, which the college stated showed their long-term commitment to agriculture. A further development in sport came in 2016 with the opening of the High Performance Sports Centre. The state-of-the-art facility cost ¬£3.2 million and complements the College's existing Sports Centre. The works consisted of the demolition and removal of an existing Sportsturf centre and workshop, as well as the demolition of a derelict, disused pavilion, to make way for the erection of the new build, which includes a purpose-built hall as well as a Strength & Conditioning suite and offices, and a separate new Sportsturf Management facility. In 2017, the College opened its Food and Farming Innovation and Technology (FFIT) Centre, a sector-leading centre of excellence for industry training and research in beef production. On the site of Myerscough's Lodge Farm, the FFIT is a major flagship build for agriculture and associated courses at Myerscough. The main FFIT Centre consists of a red brick, two-storey building to house the research and teaching facilities that link with the various technologies in the nearby Livestock Innovation Centre and farm. The FFIT Centre also boasts facilities to support food research and development with the aim of creating a resource that both local businesses and students can use to investigate opportunities to process and add value to on- farm produce.

The terrorist attack killed eight people and wounded 102. The bomb was placed inside a rubbish bin at the east end of the square. In 2015, a Court of appeal in Milan issued a final life sentence to Ordine Nuovo members Carlo Maria Maggi and Maurizio Tramonte for ordering the bombing, closing one of the longest-running cases on terrorism during Italy's years of lead. == Overview == The first judicial investigation led to the condemnation in 1979 of a member of the Brescian far-right movement, Ermanno Buzzi. However, this first sentence was cancelled in 1982, but in 1983 the Court of Cassation declared the appeal process must be redone at the Court of Appeal in Venice. The suspects were acquitted in 1985 by the Court of Venice, and in 1987 by the Supreme Court of Cassation. Buzzi, killed in Novara's prison by neo-fascists Pierluigi Concutelli and Mario Tuti in 1981, was judged \\"a corpse to be carried out\\". A second investigation led to the accusation of another far-right activists; Cesare Ferri, Sergio Latini and Alessandro Stepanoff. They were acquitted for lack of evidence in 1987; in 1989 Ferri and Latini were acquitted of having committed the crime, Stepanoff for lack of evidence. A third investigation led to a trial for Francesco Delfino (a Carabiniere), Carlo Maria Maggi, Pino Rauti, Maurizio Tramonte and Delfo Zorzi (members of the Ordine Nuovo neo- fascist group). The presence of Tramonte in the place at the time of the blast was confirmed in 2008 by the results of an anthropological forensic test on a picturePhoto from Repubblica.it from a 2008 publication taken that day.\\"Strage di piazza della Loggia, spunta la foto choc della strage\\" la Repubblica. 30 August 2008 . On 16 November 2010, the Court of Brescia acquitted the defendants (the prosecutor had requested life imprisonment for Delfino, Maggi, Tramonte and Zorzi, and the acquittal for lack of evidence for Pino Rauti). The four defendants were acquitted also in 2012, but in 2014 the supreme Court of Cassation declared the appeal process must be redone at the Court of appeal in Milan for Maggi and Tramonte. Delfino and Zorzi are finally acquitted. On 22 July 2015, the Court of appeal sentenced Maggi and Tramonte to life imprisonment for ordering and coordinating the massacre. On 21 of June 2017, Tramonte was arrested in Portugal by the Portuguese Police in the Sanctuary of F√°tima, while allegedly praying for forgiveness.

Ashby was both a criminal barrister (1963-2001) and a British politician. His political career spanned over twenty years, starting in 1968 as a local Conservative councillor for Hammersmith (Greater London) where he was Chairman for Housing and then progressing as a Conservative Councillor for the Greater London Council (GLC) representing Eltham from 1977‚Äì1981. While at the GLC (subsequently dissolved under Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986), he was Chairman of Housing and Management and campaigned fervently for a fairer system of council house distribution by moving power to the boroughs and decentralising. In 1983 he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Leicestershire NW, seen as a marginal seat. He was a back-bench MP under both the Thatcher and the Major governments and sat on many committees including the Home Affairs and Freedom of Information committees. During the \\"Back to Basics\\" campaign run in 1994 by the Major government, Ashby came under media scrutiny after his wife claimed that during a trip he had shared a hotel bed with another man supposedly due to the unavailability of a twin-bedded room. Ashby refused to name the other man concerned, but later stated he was seeking legal advice about newspaper articles that reported his wife as saying that Ashby had left her for another man, attributing his marriage breakdown instead to the long hours in Parliament and to a growing rift between them. == References Further reading== * Times Guide to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Limited, 1992 and 1997 editions. == External links == * Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of the Greater London Council Category:People educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe Category:UK MPs 1983‚Äì1987 Category:UK MPs 1987‚Äì1992 Category:UK MPs 1992‚Äì1997 Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:LGBT politicians from England Category:LGBT members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ","title":"David Ashby"},{"id":"5570847","text":"IFRB is the acronym for: *The International Frequency Registration Board, a former organ of the International Telecommunication Union, whose responsibilities have been taken over by the Radio Regulations Board (RRB) and the Radiocommunication Bureau (BR). *You may have mis-typed IRFB, the International Rugby Football Board, the predecessor to the International Rugby Board.

It works particularly well against secondaries that don't have more than one safety who is effective in coverage, or against defenses that employ 2 or 4 deep zone players, leaving a void deep down the middle. If the safeties play deep enough to stop it, the post route tends to open space for shorter pass routes over the middle. Also, the threat of a post route can force safeties to play far from the line of scrimmage, reducing the number of defenders available to slow down the running game. Cover 3 packages can be effective against the post route if the defender in middle deep coverage is perceptive enough. Also, since the post route is one of the longest routes, an effective pass rush can force the quarterback to get rid of the ball before the receiver can get open. To run the route effectively, a wide receiver must have excellent speed and should be adept at catching the ball in traffic if the safety closes to break up the pass. A variant of the post pattern, in which the receiver cuts infield at a shallower angle, is called a skinny post.http://midvalleysports.com/?p=8438 It is designed to find a hole in deep coverage, cutting shallow inside the deep sideline defender, but not far enough to draw the middle defender. ==References== Category:American football plays ","title":"Post route"},{"id":"5570860","text":"Marine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron 302 (HMHT-302), is a United States Marine Corps helicopter training squadron stationed at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. Known as the \\"Phoenix\\", HMHT-302 trains newly designated Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, refresher pilots, and enlisted aircrew on the CH-53E Super Stallion and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 29 (MAG-29) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). ==Mission== Conduct combat capable helicopter flight training for all CH-53E Super Stallion Marine Corps pilots and aircrew. All basic, conversion and refresher pilots as well as aircrew receive assault support training in the CH-53E to prepare them for follow on assignment in the Fleet Marine Force. ==History== Marine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron 302 was originally designated Marine Medium Helicopter Training Squadron 302 (HMMT-302), on November 1, 1966, at Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana, California, and assigned to Marine Helicopter Training Group 30, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The squadron was tasked with training newly designated Naval Aviators and conversion pilots to fly the Boeing-Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight. Upon deactivation, the squadron had accumulated 34,850.7 flight hours without mishap. On March 31, 1972, personnel from HMT-302 were merged with Marine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron 301 (HMT-301), to form the newly designated Marine Helicopter Training Squadron 301 (HMT-301), conducting pilot training in the CH-46F and CH-53A helicopters. The restructured HMT-301 was attached to Marine Aircraft Group 16. In December 1983, the squadron began training CH-53E Replacement Aircrew (RAC), and later established the Fleet Readiness Aviation Maintenance Personnel (FRAMP) department to train CH-53E enlisted mechanics and technicians. On November 20, 1987, the squadron was reactivated and designated Marine Helicopter Training Squadron 302 (HMT-302) attached to Marine Aircraft Group 16 flying both the CH-53A and CH-53E helicopters. The FRAMP accompanied the helicopters to HMT-302 and in 1991, added the CH-53A/D to their curricula. Between January 9 and January 23, 1996, HMT-302 safely executed a transcontinental move to MCAS New River, North Carolina. The transfer became effective in February 1996 when HMT-302 officially attached to MAG-29. An aircraft from the squadron was included in scenes flying through a downtown in the 1997 movie The Jackal (1997 film). In March to April 1998, HMT-302 deployed to South Africa in support of Presidential Operation -- the first Fleet Replacement Squadron to deploy overseas for a real world military operation. As of March 4, 2003, HMT-302 has surpassed 82710 Class A mishap- free flight hours in Sikorsky H-53 helicopters. In the summer of 2010, HMT-302 was re-branded Marine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron 302 (HMHT-302). ==Unit awards== *60px Navy Unit Commendation *60px Meritorious Unit Commendation *60px National Defense Service Medal ==See also== * List of United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons * United States Marine Corps Aviation ==References== ;Notes : ;Bibliography ==External links== * HMHT-302's official website *Official HMHT-302 Facebook * Category:Training squadrons of the United States Marine Corps ","title":"HMHT-302"},{"id":"5570861","text":"Dorothy Benham, Miss Minnesota 1976 and Miss America 1977 Gretchen Carlson, Miss Minnesota 1988 and Miss America 1989 The Miss Minnesota competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Minnesota in the Miss America pageant.

Born in Haimhausen, Bavaria, Eckartshausen studied philosophy and Bavarian civil law in Munich and Ingolstadt. He was the author of The Cloud upon the Sanctuary (:de:Die Wolke √ºber dem Heiligtum), a work of Christian mysticism which was later taken up by occultists. Translated into English by Isabelle de Steiger, the book was given a high status in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, particularly by Arthur Edward Waite. It is known to have attracted English author and the founder of Thelema, Aleister Crowley, to the Order.Booth, p. 59 Eckartshausen later joined the order of the Illuminati founded by Adam Weishaupt, but \\"withdrew his membership soon after discovering that this order only recognized enlightenment through human reason.\\"Harmsen Von Eckartshausen was acquainted with Johann Georg Schr√∂pfer, an early pioneer of phantasmagoria, and himself experimented with the use of magic lanterns to create \\"ghost projections\\" in front of an audience of four or five people.

M. Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up and later adaptations and extensions to the story. They are boys \\"who fall out of their prams when the nurse is looking the other way and if they are not claimed in seven days, they are sent far away to the Neverland,\\" where Peter Pan is their captain.Barrie, J.M. Peter Pan (play). Hodder & Stoughton, 1928, Act I, Scene 1 There are no \\"lost girls\\" because, as Peter explains, girls are far too clever to fall out of their prams. ==Original Lost Boys== Tootles is described as the most unfortunate and humblest of the band, because \\"the big things\\" and adventures happen while \\"he has stepped round the corner.\\" This however has not soured but sweetened his nature. He is the one who shoots Wendy with a bow and arrow after Tinker Bell tells them Wendy is a bird that Peter wants killed. When Tootles realises his mistake, he asks Peter to kill him. Wendy however survives, and Tootles is spared. Tootles is the first to defend Wendy when she wants to return to London. When Peter takes possession of \\"The Jolly Roger,\\" Captain Hook's pirate ship, Tootles takes Smee's place as boatswain. At the end of the novel, he returns to London with Wendy and the other lost boys and eventually grows up to become a judge. Nibs is described as happy and debonair, possibly the bravest Lost Boy. The only thing he remembers about his mother is that she always wanted a cheque book and says he would love to give her one‚Äîif he knew what it was. He grows up to work in an office. Slightly is described as the most conceited of the boys, because he believes that he remembers what life was like before he was \\"lost.\\" However, most of his \\"memories\\" are based on misunderstandings: for example, he claims to know what his last name is because his pinafore had the words \\"Slightly Soiled\\" written on the tag. Slightly is a poor make-believer, but he does seem to have a talent for music; he is described as cutting whistles and flutes from the branches of trees and dancing to tunes he creates himself. He grows up to marry into nobility and become a lord. Curly is described by Barrie as \\"a pickle\\" (a person who gets into pickles) and has curly hair, hence his name. He isn't very smart but is very loveable. Curly is also a little timid but has a kind heart. Curly grows up to work in an office. The Twins ‚Äî First and Second Twin know little about themselves as they are not allowed to because Peter Pan does not know what Twins are, and no Lost Boy is allowed to know anything that Peter doesn't. The Twins grow up to work in an office. == Adaptations in literature == Peter and the Starcatchers In the Peter and the Starcatchers series, an earlier group of Lost Boys include boys who Peter knew from St. Norbert's orphanage, and who return to England with the heroine's family at the end of the prequels. This description does not concord with the canon backstory for the Lost Boys, who are not orphaned, but lost as babies. * Prentiss ‚Äî A rather new boy at St. Norbert's. * James ‚Äî James seems to be closer to Peter than any other boy at St. Norbert's. He serves as the leader to the Lost Boys when Peter is not around, making him the second-in-command. * Tubby Ted ‚Äî As a running gag, Tubby Ted is always hungry. * Thomas ‚Äî A boy from St. Norbert's. In Peter and the Secret of Rundoon, some other boys from St. Norbert's, who used to be slaves for King Zarboff, end up going to Neverland with Peter. They have the same names as J. M. Barrie's original Lost Boys. By the end of the novel, Prentiss, James, Tubby Ted, and Thomas decide to go back to London with Leonard Aster because they realize they would become men some day and cannot keep up with Peter forever. They leave for the real world and all grow up. Peter and Tinker Bell take in the new, more familiar Lost Boys. However, Peter is reunited with James, who has grown up, in the fourth novel, Peter and the Sword of Mercy. Peter Pan in Scarlet In Peter Pan in Scarlet, Tootles becomes a girl because he only has daughters to borrow clothes from in order to become a child again and go back to Neverland. He finds his father, who is a judge, too. Nibs is the only Lost Boy not to return to Neverland because he can't bear the thought of leaving his children. Because of this he also is the only one who never meets his real parents, stays an orphan and has no chance to learn anything of his earlier life. Slightly plays the clarinet and saves the day a couple of times with his music. Slightly grows up to marry a noblewoman and becomes a lord, though he has become a widower at the age of thirty and is the only one of the Lost Boys not to father any children. He gets tricked by the new enemy when he returns to Neverland and grows up, much to Peter's anger. Thanks to his love for music he finds his real mother and after returning to London he is the only Lost Boy who doesn't return to his adult age, but stays eighteen and stays with his mother. Curly has become a doctor and is the owner of one of Nana's great-great-puppies, which travels with him to Neverland. He is the one who gives up his youth and childhood to save Peter's life. The Twins have grown up to work in an office and their names are revealed to be Marmaduke and Binky. They find their mother and take her back to their house in London. == Adaptations in film == Disney's Peter Pan films Peter Pan with the Lost Boys, depicted in the 1953 film.In their appearances in the Disney franchise, the Lost Boys are often named after their animal costumes: Fox/Slightly, Rabbit/Nibs, Bear/Cubby, Skunk/Tootles, and the Raccoons/Twins. In Disney's first Peter Pan film (1953), the Boys play smaller roles and are less characterised, appearing more as a group than individually. In Return to Neverland, they are named as their original counterparts (with the exception of Cubby). Tootles is silent in both films, communicating with a pad and pencil in the latter film. In Barrie's original works, the Lost Boys leave Neverland and grow up, while in the Disney films they are merely tempted to, but change their minds and choose to remain with Peter Pan. In Return to Neverland, which takes place many years later, they are still with Peter, and have remained children. Spielberg's Hook In Spielberg's sequel Hook (1991), there are at least two dozen Lost Boys of various ethnicity living in Neverland, whose clothes suggest that they left various civilisations at different times over the past century. They live in a giant tree on a tall rocky outcropping just offshore of the island. Twins are seen wearing Boy Scout uniforms. The Lost Boys named in the film are: * Rufio (Dante Basco), * Thud Butt (Raushan Hammond), * Pockets (Isaiah Robinson), * Ace (Jasen Fisher), * Don't Ask (James Madio), * Too Small (Thomas Tulak), * Latchboy (Alex Zuckerman), and * No Nap (Ahmad Stoner). The boys are led by Rufio, who was hand-chosen by Peter as leader when he left Neverland to grow up as \\"Peter Banning.\\" Initially, Rufio refuses to believe that Peter Banning is their former leader, as do most of the boys. However, Tinker Bell and the glimpse of Peter Pan that Pockets sees in Banning's face convince them and they train him for a showdown with Captain Hook. The Lost Boys gradually come to believe in Peter, a turning point being when he manages to beat Rufio in a heated name- calling match. When Peter finally relearns how to fly, Rufio finally recognizes Peter is indeed Peter Pan and gives Peter the Pan sword as a sign of apology and respect. The Lost Boys follow Peter into a climactic battle with Captain Hook and the pirates, armed with improvised childlike weapons. Rufio valiantly takes on Hook while Peter rescues his daughter, Maggie. Hook fatally stabs Rufio, who dies in Peter's arms and declares he regarded Peter as a father. Peter's son Jack, witnessing Rufio's death at the hands of Hook, turns away from the life of a pirate and reconciles with his father. Peter and Hook engage in a duel which culminates in Hook apparently being eaten alive by the momentarily resurrected crocodile that had eaten Hook's hand long ago. Before leaving Neverland, Peter selects Thud Butt to be their new leader, telling him \\"I want you to take care of everyone who is smaller than you,\\" to which Thud Butt agrees. Tootles appears as an old man. He was one of the many \\"orphans\\" whom Granny Wendy is said to have found homes for over the decades. He now lives with Wendy because she could not bear to send him to a retirement home. However, he is the first to recognise that Hook has arrived in London and witnesses him abduct the children. He also knows that Peter Banning is Peter Pan and remembers him just as much as Granny Wendy. After Peter and his family arrive at Wendy's house, Peter sees him crawling on the floor, and he explains \\"I've lost my marbles,\\" which Peter Banning readily agrees with. Later in Neverland, Thud Butt gives Peter a small bag containing Tootles' marbles, revealing that they were his happy thoughts and he lost them literally rather than metaphorically. Once Peter and his children return home, Peter gives Tootles his marbles and rejoices. With the help of some fairy dust that spills out of the bag, he flies out of the window to return to Neverland.  Other films  The title of the 1987 film The Lost Boys is a reference to Peter Pan's Lost Boys. In the film, the characters retain their youth and gain their powers, including flying, by becoming vampires. The Lost Boys appear at the end of Pan (2015). Peter rescues Nibs and many other boys from an orphanage so they can have some \\"fun.\\" They are pulled on to the flying Jolly Roger and Hook refers to them as \\"Lost Boys.\\" == Adaptations in other media == Two of the Lost Boys, Cubby and Slightly, appear alongside Peter Pan and Tinker Bell in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. Before that, the Lost Boys appeared in the Kingdom Hearts manga as comic relief, fighting Donald over some treasure they found in Captain Hook's ship. The Lost Boys appear in the Season 2 finale and in the first episodes of Season 3 of Once Upon a Time. They are the murderous inhabitants of Neverland and servants of Peter Pan, portrayed by Robbie Kay. The death of Rufio is briefly mentioned by Captain Hook during a fight in the second episode. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Peter Pan characters Category:Child characters in literature Category:Child characters in film Category:Male characters in literature Category:Male characters in film Category:Sidekicks in literature Category:Film sidekicks Category:Kingdom Hearts characters Category:Play characters introduced in 1904 Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional English people Category:Once Upon a Time (TV series) characters ","title":"Lost Boys (Peter Pan)"},{"id":"5570924","text":"Newlin is a surname, and may refer to: *Brett Newlin, American rower *Colin Newlin, American actor and model *Diandra Newlin, American actor, singer, model *Dika Newlin, American musician *Jacquiline Alice Newlin, or 'Alice Day', actress *Kristen Newlin, Turkish-American basketball player *Marceline Newlin, younger sister of Alice *Maury Newlin, Major League Baseball player *Melvin E.

He was implicated in the cash-for-questions affair, a political scandal of the 1990s. He was the father of adventurer and Chief Scout Bear Grylls. ==Education and early career== The son of William Edward Harvey Grylls , of Winterbourne Zelston House, Blandford, Dorset, a Brigadier in the 15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars of a family that can be traced back to 17th century Cornwall, he was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. His eyesight was not good enough for the Navy, so he joined the Royal Marines, and saw active service, leaving in 1955, and studying Spanish at the University of Madrid. He turned his hand to business, setting up a wine importing firm called the 'Costa Brava Company'. His description of some of his products as \\"Spanish champagne\\" provoked the ire of both the makers of genuine champagne and its London importers; he was unsuccessfully prosecuted for trading under a false description, but they won a civil action against him for \\"passing off\\", i.e. misrepresenting his goods by using someone else's trademark. From 1959 he served as a councillor on St. Pancras Borough Council, and was elected to the Greater London Council for the Cities of London and Westminster from 1967‚Äì70. ==Family== Grylls married Sarah (Sally) Smiles Justice Ford, the daughter of Patricia Ford, Lady Fisher, briefly an Ulster Unionist MP, and cricketer Neville Montagu Ford. Sally is the stepdaughter of Conservative MP Nigel Fisher and the stepsister of Labour MP Mark Fisher. The Gryllses have one daughter, Lara Sarah Grylls, and one son, the adventurer and Chief Scout Edward Michael \\"Bear\\" Grylls, who is most recognised as the host of Born Survivor. ==Career as Member of Parliament== Grylls was an unsuccessful candidate in the Fulham constituency in both the 1964 and 1966 general elections. At the 1970 general election, he was returned to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Chertsey in Surrey. His seat was abolished in boundary changes, but he was returned to Parliament for the new North West Surrey constituency in the February 1974 general election. He represented this constituency until his retirement at the 1997 election. Andrew Roth, author of Parliamentary Profiles, in assessing Grylls's ideology, accused him of \\"opportunistic deviations\\", for example favouring little state interference with business, but supporting public funds for British Aerospace, which was a large employer in his constituency. He was knighted in 1992. ==Cash for questions== For some years Grylls had acted as a consultant to the lobbying company run by Ian Greer at the heart of the Cash-for-Questions inquiry. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir Gordon Downey, stated that Grylls had \\"seriously misled\\" the select committee on members' interests in 1990 (replaced in 1995 by the Standards and Privileges Committee) by understating the number of payments he had received for introducing clients to ministers and Grylls' conduct, said Sir Gordon, had fallen \\"below the standards the House is entitled to expect of its members\\". The Committee concluded that Grylls had \\"received payments from Mr Greer (though not in cash) which were neither introduction commissions nor fees associated with the Unitary Tax Campaign. It is not possible to conclude that these payments originated from Mr Al Fayed, although Sir Michael actively participated in the Greer lobbying operation. Sir Michael deliberately misled the Select Committee on Members' Interests in 1990 by seriously understating the number of commission payments he had received; and by omitting to inform them of other fees received from Mr Greer. Sir Michael persistently failed to declare his interests in dealings with Ministers and officials over the House of Fraser. Sir Michael's action in taking a commission payment for introducing a constituent to Mr Greer was unacceptable. There is insufficient evidence to show that Sir Michael solicited business for Mr Greer in expectation of commission payments.\\" ==Other== Grylls was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron until his death in 2001; his widow remains an honorary member. In Piers Morgan's Life Stories, Bear Grylls said that his father had a pace-maker fitted in February 2001, but suddenly died of a heart attack two days after his operation while recovering at home. ==References Sources == * Times Guide to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Limited, 1992 edition. == External links == * Category:1934 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Graduates of Britannia Royal Naval College Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Royal Marines officers Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council Category:Members of the Greater London Council Category:UK MPs 1970‚Äì1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974‚Äì1979 Category:UK MPs 1979‚Äì1983 Category:UK MPs 1983‚Äì1987 Category:UK MPs 1987‚Äì1992 Category:UK MPs 1992‚Äì1997 Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Politicians awarded knighthoods ","title":"Michael Grylls"},{"id":"5570951","text":"Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, the first wife of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, had six children. Some Shias dispute whether all of the children were born in her marriage to Muhammad, or if three of the four daughters were actually the daughters of Hala Bint Khuwaylid, her sister. ==Introduction== The dispute extends to Zainab, Umm Kulthum and Ruqayyah. Shi'ites believe Fatimah was the only daughter of Khadija whereas Zainab, Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum were the daughters of Khadija's sister, Hala, who had strained relations with her husband and the two girls were brought up by Khadija after the death of Hala. It is notable that before the revelation of the Quran, Muhammad also had an adopted son, that is Zayd ibn Harithah, whose name was changed back from Zayd bin Muhammad to Zayd bin Harithah, after the prohibition of conferring the non-biological father's name to the adopted. This debate becomes significant and contentious since two of the children, Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum were consecutively married to Uthman, one after the death of the other, and was thus called Dhul-N≈´rayn (, \\"He of the Two Lights\\").anwary-islam.com ==Views== The Quran refers to Muhammad's daughters as his banƒÅ·π´ (, 'daughters').The Arabic language has three persons - singular, dual, and plural, with the latter referring to more than two. For further explanation, refer to Arabic grammar. There is another argument regarding the explanation of word \\"Banat\\" that it does not refer to the immediate daughters, but the female descendants from the line of Fatimah till the Day of Judgment. Sunni Sunnis reject the notion of them being born anywhere but in Muhammad's marriage. Sunnis believe that Ruqayyah was born three years after the birth of Zainab, when Muhammad was 33. Shi'i Shi'ites believe that Fatimah was Muhammad's only biological daughter.Al-Tijani in his The Shi'ah are (the real) Ahl al-Sunnah on Al-Islam.org note 274 Shia argue it improbable for Khadija to have given birth to so many children at such an advanced age, while having had no children in both her previous marriages. A third version also exists which views the two daughters as being the children of Khadijah's deceased sister, Halah bint Khuwailid. Shi'ites justify their belief that Fatimah was Muhammad's only biological daughter by referring to the event of Mubahila, (though all three elder daughters had died by that time). Concerning this event, the Quran says: According to a hadith in Bihar al-Anwar, no woman other than Fatimah was present at the Mubahilah. For this reason, Shi'ites believe that the phrase \\"our women\\" in the Quran refers only to Fatimah.@ Al- Islam.ORGMubahala (Imprecation) @ ezsoftech.com ==See also== *Disputed issues in the early Islamic history *Burial place of Fatimah *Descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib *Family tree of Ali *Family tree of Muhammad ==ReferencesFurther reading== For Sunni view see: * Ibn Hisham's Sira, Vol. 1, p. 122 * Tabari's History of Prophets and Kings, Vol. 2, p. 35 * Ibn Kathir's Al- Bidayah Wa An-Nihaya, Vo. 2, p. 359 For Shi'a sources that mention other daughters of Muhammad, see: *Tusi's Tahthibul Ahkam, Vol. 8, p. 258 *Shaikh Saduq's Khisal, p. 404 *Kulayni's Al-Kafi, Vol. 5, p. 555 *Shaykh Mufid's Al- Muqanna'ah, p. 332 *Himyari's Qurb Al-Isnad, p. 9 *Papyrus scroll of Ibn Lahi'ah, referenced by G.

The organism took the form of an elongated cone with a central depression, and its apex was anchored to the substrate. ==Morphology== The fossils take the form of a triangle with a central depression, suggesting that the original organism was conical. The diameter to height ratio of the organism is roughly constant in each location at 1 to 3 in the younger beds, and from 1 to 2.5 in the older beds. The constant ratio suggests that it grew by adding to its body at the base of the cone. The triangle has a raised margin about a quarter of the width of the triangle. The interior either is blank, depressed, or has some vague transverse markings. The impression occurs in the upper bed rather than the lower surface. ==Occurrence== 205 specimens of Thectardis are known, from two bedding surfaces, separated by 2 km and 10 million years at Mistaken Point, Newfoundland. Thectardis bearing bedding surfaces also contain Charnia and Ivesheadia. Thectardis avalonensis - Life restoration at MUSE - Science Museum in Trento ==Ecology== Water currents knocked down the triangles in the same direction, and where they fall on top of other objects they flex over the top. When alive, the organism probably stuck to the microbial mats that bound the Ediacaran sea floor, standing on their tips like a pin in a pin cushion, so that the organism would have resembled an inverted cone. They probably fed on suspended particles. As there is no evidence for a holdfast anchoring them to the sea floor, it remains a matter of speculation how they were attached. ==Etymology== The generic name Thectardis is derived from the Greek thektos, sharp-pointed, and ardis, arrow- point. The specific name derives from the Avalon Peninsula, where it was found. Thus, Thectardis avalonensis translates as \\"sharp arrow-point of Avalon (Peninsula).\\" ==See also== List of Ediacaran genera ==References== * Category:Ediacaran biota Category:Ediacaran Canada Category:Prehistoric incertae sedis animal genera Category:Fossil taxa described in 2004 ","title":"Thectardis"},{"id":"5570975","text":"Ernst Aigner (born 31 October 1966 in M√∂dling) is a retired Austrian footballer. ==Club career== A tall central defender, Aigner made his debut in the Austrian Bundesliga for Admira/Wacker in 1986 and finished runner-up to Swarovski Tirol with Admira in the 1988‚Äì89 season.

In geochemistry, compatibility is a measure of how readily a particular trace element substitutes for a major element within a mineral. Compatibility of an ion is controlled by two things: its valence and its ionic radius. Both must approximate those of the major element for the trace element to be compatible in the mineral. For instance, olivine (an abundant mineral in the upper mantle) has the chemical formula . Nickel, with very similar chemical behaviour to iron and magnesium, substitutes readily for them and hence is very compatible in the mantle. Compatibility controls the partitioning of different elements during melting. The compatibility of an element in a rock is a weighted average of its compatibility in each of the minerals present. By contrast, an incompatible element is one that is least stable within its crystal structure. If an element is incompatible in a rock, it partitions into a melt as soon as melting begins. In general, when an element is referred to as being ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù without mentioning what rock it is compatible in, the mantle is implied. Thus incompatible elements are those that are enriched in the continental crust and depleted in the mantle. Examples include: rubidium, barium, uranium, and lanthanum. Compatible elements are depleted in the crust and enriched in the mantle, with examples nickel and titanium. Compatibility is commonly described by an element's distribution coefficient. A distribution coefficient describes how the solid and liquid phases of an element will distribute themselves in a mineral. Current studies of Earth's rare trace elements seek to quantify and examine the chemical composition of elements in the Earth's crust. There are still uncertainties in the understanding of the lower crust and upper mantle region of Earth's interior. In addition, numerous studies have focused on looking at the partition coefficients of certain elements in the basaltic magma to characterize the composition of oceanic crust. By having a way to measure the composition of elements in the crust and mantle given a mineral sample, compatibility allows relative concentrations of a particular trace element to be determined. From a petrological point of view, the understanding of how major and rare trace elements differentiate in the melt provides deeper understanding of Earth's chemical evolution over the geologic time scale. == Quantifying compatibility ==  Distribution (Partition) coefficient  In a mineral, nearly all elements distribute unevenly between the solid and liquid phase. This phenomenon known as chemical fractionation and can be described by an equilibrium constant, K which sets a fixed distribution of an element between any two phases at equilibrium. A distribution constant K_D is used to define the relationship between the solid and liquid phase of a reaction. This value is essentially a ratio of the concentration of an element between two phases, typically between the solid and liquid phase in this context. This constant is often referred to as D when dealing with trace elements, where K_D=\\\\frac{C_S}{C_L}=\\\\frac{X_i^{solid}}{X_i^{liquid}} K_D=D for trace elements The equilibrium constant is an empirically determined value. These values depend on temperature, pressure, and composition of the mineral melt. D values differ considerably between major elements and trace elements. By definition, incompatible trace elements have an equilibrium constant value of less than one because trace elements have higher concentrations in the melt than solids. This means that compatible elements have a value of D\\\\gg1. Thus, incompatible elements are concentrated in the melt, whereas compatible elements tend to be concentrated in the solid. Compatible elements with D\\\\gg1 are strongly fractionated and have very low concentrations in the liquid phase.  Bulk distribution coefficient  The bulk distribution coefficient is used to calculate the elemental composition for any element that makes up a mineral in a rock. The bulk distribution coefficient, \\\\overline{D}_i, is defined as \\\\overline{D}_i=\\\\Sigma W_AD_i^A where i is the element of interest in the mineral, and W_A is the weight fraction of mineral A in the rock. D_i^A is the distribution coefficient for the element in mineral A. This constant can be used to describe how individual elements in a mineral is concentrated in two different phases. During chemical fractionation, certain elements may become more or less concentrated, which can allow geochemists to quantify the different stages of magma differentiation. Ultimately, these measurements can be used to provide further understanding of elemental behavior in different geologic settings. == Applications == One of the main sources of information about the Earth's composition comes from understanding the relationship between peridotite and basalt melting. Peridotite makes up most of Earth's mantle. Basalt, which is highly concentrated in the Earth's oceanic crust, is formed when magma reaches the Earth's surface and cools down at a very fast rate. When magma cools, different minerals crystallize at different times depending on the cooling temperature of that respective mineral. This ultimately changes the chemical composition of the melt as different minerals begin to crystallize. Fractional crystallization of elements in basaltic liquids has also been studied to observe the composition of lava in the upper mantle. This concept can be applied by scientists to give insight on the evolution of Earth's mantle and how concentrations of lithophile trace elements have varied over the last 3.5 billion years.  Understanding the Earth's interior  Previous studies have used compatibility of trace elements to see the effect it would have on the melt structure of the peridotite solidus. In such studies, partition coefficients of specific elements were examined and the magnitude of these values gave researchers some indication about the degree of polymerization of the melt. A study conducted in East China in 1998 looked at the chemical composition of various elements found in the crust in China. One of the parameters used to characterize and describe the crustal structure in this region was compatibility of various element pairs. Essentially, studies like this showed how compatibility of certain elements can change and be affected by the chemical compositions and conditions of Earth's interior. Oceanic volcanism is another topic that commonly incorporates the use of compatibility. Since the 1960s, the structure of Earth's mantle started being studied by geochemists. The oceanic crust, which is rich in basalts from volcanic activity, show distinct components that provides information about the evolution of the Earth's interior over the geologic timescale. Incompatible trace elements become depleted when mantle melts and become enriched in oceanic or continental crust through volcanic activity. Other times, volcanism can produce enriched mantle melt onto the crust. These phenomena can be quantified by looking at radioactive decay records of isotopes in these basalts, which is a valuable tool for mantle geochemists. More specifically, the geochemistry of serpentinites along the ocean floor, specifically subduction zones, can be examined using compatibility of specific trace elements. The compatibility of lead (Pb) into zircons under different environments can also be an indication of zircons in rocks. When observing levels of non-radiogenic lead in zircons, this can be a useful tool for radiometric dating of zircons. == References == Category:Geochemistry Category:Geology ","title":"Compatibility (geochemistry)"},{"id":"5571007","text":"Antonio Conte (; born 31 July 1969) is an Italian professional football manager and former player. He is the head coach at Serie A club Inter Milan. Playing as a midfielder, Conte began his career at local club Lecce and later became one of the most decorated and influential players in the history of Juventus. He captained the team and won the UEFA Champions League, as well as five Serie A titles, among other honours. He also played for the Italy national team and was a participant at the 1994 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, where, on both occasions, Italy finished runners-up. His managerial career started in 2006, leading Bari to the 2008‚Äì09 Serie B title, and Siena to promotion from the same division two years later. He then took over at Juventus in 2011, where he implemented a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation and won three consecutive Serie A titles, before taking charge of the Italian national team in 2014 until the UEFA Euro 2016 campaign. He became the manager of Chelsea in April 2016 and led them to the Premier League title in his first season in charge, later winning the FA Cup in his second season with the team. He was dismissed as Chelsea manager in July 2018. He was announced as the new Inter Milan manager on 31 May 2019. Conte is credited as to bringing back and popularizing the 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation after it had seen very limited use since its heyday at the 1990 World Cup. ==Club career== Lecce Conte began his career with the youth team of his hometown club Lecce and made his Serie A debut with the first team on 6 April 1986, aged 16, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Pisa. Under manager Carlo Mazzone, he became a fundamental player for the squad. In 1987, he fractured his tibia, running the risk of a career-ending injury. However, during the 1988‚Äì89 season, he was back in the pitch, and scored his first Serie A goal on 11 November 1989 in 3‚Äì2 loss to Napoli. He amassed a total of 99 appearances and 1 goal for Lecce. Juventus Conte (centre) playing as Juventus' captain in a 1997‚Äì98 Coppa Italia match Conte was signed by Juventus manager Giovanni Trapattoni in 1991 (Conte refers to Trapattoni as being his \\"second father\\"),Antonio Conte racconta il Trap: \\"Un secondo padre\\" (in Italian) Sport.sky.it debuting on 17 November 1991 against cross-city rivals Torino. Due to his consistent performances, work-rate, leadership and tenacious playing style, he became an important figure with the club's fans, and was later named the team's captain under Marcello Lippi in 1996, following the departure of the club's previous captain Gianluca Vialli, and before the promotion of Alessandro Del Piero to the role. During the 1998‚Äì99 season, when Del Piero suffered a severe knee injury, Conte returned to the captaincy, a position which he maintained until the 2001‚Äì02 season. During his Juventus playing career, Conte won five Serie A titles, the 1994‚Äì95 Coppa Italia, the 1992‚Äì93 UEFA Cup and the 1995‚Äì96 UEFA Champions League, as well as four Supercoppa Italiana titles, the 1996 UEFA Super Cup, the 1996 Intercontinental Cup (which he missed due to injury) and the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup, winning all possible top tier club titles, aside from the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Along with his team, Conte also finished as runner-up in the Champions League on three other occasions, as Juventus lost the Champions League finals of 1997, 1998 and 2003. In the latter final, against A.C. Milan, he came on as a substitute in the second half and produced Juventus' best chance of the match, hitting the crossbar with a header, although Juventus eventually lost the match on penalties following a 0‚Äì0 draw after extra time. Conte also finished runner-up in the 1995 UEFA Cup Final with the club. He remained with the Turin-based club until his retirement in 2004. During his 13 seasons with Juventus, he made a total of 295 appearances and 29 goals in Serie A, and 418 appearances and 43 goals in all competitions. ==International career== Conte's jersey from the 1994 FIFA World Cup, in which Italy reached the final Conte also played for the Italy national team, making his debut on 27 May 1994, in a 2‚Äì0 friendly win over Finland at age 24, under Arrigo Sacchi. He was a member of the Italian squads for both the 1994 FIFA World Cup under Sacchi, and UEFA Euro 2000 under Dino Zoff, achieving runners-up medals in both tournaments. However, he missed out on the Euro 1996 squad after sustaining an injury in the 1996 Champions League final. Conte scored a bicycle kick in Italy's opening match of Euro 2000, which ended in a 2‚Äì1 win against Turkey, although he later suffered an injury in a 2‚Äì0 win against Romania in the quarter-finals of the competition, following a challenge from Gheorghe Hagi, which ruled him out for the remainder of the competition. In total, he made 20 international appearances for Italy between 1994 and 2000, scoring twice. ==Style of play== Considered to be one of the most important Italian midfielders of his generation, Conte was regarded as a quick, combative, energetic, and tactically versatile footballer throughout his career who could play anywhere in midfield but was usually deployed as a central, box-to-box, or defensive midfielder, and occasionally on the right flank, due to his crossing ability. Although he was not the most naturally talented or skilful footballer from a technical standpoint (although he was able to improve in this area with time), Conte was a hard-working, consistent and intelligent player, with an innate ability to read the game, who was mainly known for his leadership, strong mentality, accurate tackling, stamina, and vision; these attributes, coupled with his solid first touch, work-rate, tenacity, and a tendency to make offensive runs into the area, enabled him to aid his team effectively both defensively and offensively, and gave him the ability to distribute the ball and start attacking moves after retrieving possession, as well as the capacity to turn defence into an attack. Due to his ball-striking from distance and ability to get forward, he also scored some spectacular and decisive goals, often from volleys and strikes from outside the area. He was also considered to be physically strong, good in the air and accurate with his head, despite not being particularly tall. Despite his ability as a footballer, his career was often affected by injuries. ==Coaching career== Arezzo Conte in 2005 After retiring from playing, Conte worked as an assistant manager for Siena alongside Luigi De Canio in the 2005‚Äì06 season. In July 2006, he was appointed coach of Serie B side Arezzo. However, after a series of disappointing results, he was sacked on 31 October 2006. On 13 March 2007, Conte was reinstated as Arezzo head coach as his predecessor Maurizio Sarri failed to gain any significant improvement with the club mired in a relegation struggle. He subsequently led the team to five consecutive wins, securing 19 points from 7 matches, which allowed the Tuscan side to close the points gap between them and safety. In spite of this turnaround in form, Arezzo was relegated to Serie C1 on the final day of the league season, finishing one point behind Spezia. Bari On 27 December 2007, Conte was appointed by Bari to replace Giuseppe Materazzi for the second half of their 2007‚Äì08 Serie B campaign. He oversaw a considerable upturn in form, leading the team out of the relegation battle and placing them comfortably mid-table. The following season, 2008‚Äì09, Bari were crowned Serie B champions, being promoted to Serie A for the 2009‚Äì10 season, Conte's first major honour as a manager. In June 2009, after weeks of rumours linking Conte to the vacant managerial role at Juventus, he agreed in principle for a contract extension to keep him at Bari for the new season. However, on 23 June, Bari announced they had rescinded the contract with Conte by mutual consent. After Claudio Ranieri was sacked by Juventus, Conte was again reported to be a potential replacement. Shortly prior to Ranieri's termination, Conte had made public his ambition to be Juventus coach at some stage and was confident he was ready for the demands of the role. Again, Juventus declined to hire their former midfielder and appointed Ciro Ferrara instead. Atalanta Conte managing Atalanta in a Serie A match On 21 September 2009, Conte replaced Angelo Gregucci as manager of Atalanta. Despite a good start at the helm of the Orobici, the club found itself struggling by November, leading to protests from local supporters and friction between Conte and the club's ultra supporters. On 6 January 2010, Conte was repeatedly confronted by Atalanta fans during a home game against Napoli which ended in a 0‚Äì2 defeat for the Nerazzurri. The match ended with Conte receiving police protection to avoid an altercation with the Atalanta ultras. The next day, Conte tended his resignation to the club, leaving them in 19th place. Siena On 9 May 2010, Conte was announced as new head coach of Siena, with the aim of leading the Tuscan side back to the top flight after relegation to the 2010‚Äì11 Serie B. Conte successfully secured promotion for Siena, which would be competing in the 2011‚Äì12 Serie A season. Juventus Conte with Juventus in 2012 On 22 May 2011, Juventus sporting director Giuseppe Marotta announced Juventus had appointed Conte as its new head coach, replacing Luigi Delneri. Conte arrived amid high expectations that he, a former fan favourite as a midfielder for the club, would lead them back to the summit of the Italian and European game. His first ten months as manager saw the club reach a number of landmarks such as, following a 5‚Äì0 win over rivals Fiorentina, equalling Fabio Capello's run of 28 unbeaten matches between November 2005 and May 2006. On 20 March 2012, Conte became the first coach to lead Juventus to a Coppa Italia final since Marcello Lippi in the 2004 Coppa Italia Final. On 25 March, following a 2‚Äì0 victory at the Juventus Stadium, he became the first coach to complete the league double in the Derby d'Italia against rivals Inter Milan since Capello in 2005‚Äì06. In November 2012, Conte was awarded the Trofeo Maestrelli, an award honouring the three best Italian coaches working in the professional league, the country's youth coaching system and outside Italy, respectively. Despite drawing a large number of matches during the season, on 6 May 2012 Conte led Juventus to their 28th league title with one match remaining by beating Cagliari 2‚Äì0. After beating Atalanta 3‚Äì1, Juventus finished the league unbeaten, the first team to do so since Serie A expanded to 20 teams and 38 rounds. Conte's innovative 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation, which featured wingbacks and two box-to-box midfielders in a three-man midfield, gave more creative freedom to the newly acquired deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo, who was key to the club's success that season. The club's strong and highly organised three-man back-line, which was predominantly composed of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, and Andrea Barzagli, was regarded to have played a large part in the title triumph, and only conceded 20 goals, finishing the league with the best defence in Italy. However, Juventus lost the 2012 Coppa Italia final to Napoli 2‚Äì0, their only defeat in domestic competitions that season. Conte's Juventus won the 2012‚Äì13 Serie A title as they accumulated 87 points, three more than the previous season, nine more than second-placed Napoli and 15 more than third-placed Milan. Despite their dominance, Juventus' top goalscorers in the league were midfielder Arturo Vidal and forward Mirko Vuƒçiniƒá, both with just ten goals, making them joint 23rd in the goal-scoring chart. In his first Champions League campaign, Juventus was eliminated by eventual winners Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, losing 4‚Äì0 on aggregate. After winning a second consecutive Supercoppa Italiana in 2013, Juventus won their third consecutive Serie A title under Conte during the 2013‚Äì14 season, winning the league with a Serie A record of 102 points. This was also the club's 30th league title. However, Juventus continued to disappoint in Europe and were eliminated from the group stage of the Champions League that season, although they subsequently managed to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League. On 15 July 2014, Conte resigned as manager. During his three seasons as Juventus manager, he won the Panchina d'Oro for each one, for best Serie A coach of the season. Italy national team Azerbaijan, the match in which UEFA Euro 2016 qualification was achieved On 14 August 2014, following Italy national team manager Cesare Prandelli's resignation, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) announced to have agreed a two-year deal with Conte as new head coach of the national team until Euro 2016. With the national side, Conte continued to field formations which he had employed during his successful spell with Juventus, varying between the 4‚Äì3‚Äì3, 4‚Äì2‚Äì4, 3‚Äì3‚Äì4, and the 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 in particular, with the latter being the tactical choice that ultimately replaced Prandelli's 4‚Äì3‚Äì1‚Äì2 midfield diamond formation. His first match as Italy manager was a 2‚Äì0 win over Netherlands, during which Ciro Immobile and Daniele De Rossi scored the goals for Gli Azzurri. Conte won his first competitive match on 9 September 2014, defeating Norway 2‚Äì0 in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying match in Oslo, with goals by Simone Zaza and Leonardo Bonucci. This was the first time Italy had managed to defeat the Norwegians in Norway since 1937. After ten matches as Italy manager, Conte suffered his first defeat on 16 June 2015, in a 1‚Äì0 international friendly loss against Portugal. He sealed Euro 2016 qualification for Italy on 10 October 2015, as Italy defeated Azerbaijan 3‚Äì1 in Baku. The result meant Italy had managed to go 50 matches unbeaten in European qualifiers. On 15 March 2016, the FIGC confirmed Conte would step down as manager after Euro 2016. Although many fans and members of the media were initially critical of Conte's tactics and the level of the Italian squad chosen for the competition, Italy opened the tournament with a promising 2‚Äì0 victory over the number-one ranked European team Belgium on 13 June. Following the win, Conte drew praise from the media for the team's unity, defensive strength, and for his tactical approach to the match, which impeded Belgium from creating many goalscoring opportunities. Conte led Italy out of the group to the Round of 16 with one match to spare on 17 June after a 1‚Äì0 victory against Sweden. Italy had not won the second group match in a major international tournament since Euro 2000, in which Conte had coincidentally appeared as a player. Conte also led Italy to the top of the group, the first time in a major tournament since the 2006 World Cup. After the 2‚Äì0 round of 16 win over defending champions Spain, Conte's Italy then faced off against rivals and reigning world champions Germany in the quarter- final, which ended 1‚Äì1 after extra time and 6‚Äì5 in favour of Germany after the resulting penalty shoot-out, ending his time as Italy manager. Speaking after the match, Conte said, \\"[T]he decision to leave the national team after two years was taken early,\\" and that the reason for leaving was because he \\"wanted to return to the cut and thrust of club football\\". Chelsea Chelsea training session, five days before his first Premier League match On 4 April 2016, it was confirmed Conte had signed a three-year contract, which would keep him at the club until 2019, and would officially become the new first- team head coach of English side Chelsea from the 2016‚Äì17 season. On 15 August, Chelsea started off the season with a 2‚Äì1 win over West Ham United. On 17 December, Conte set a new club record with 11 consecutive league victories in a single season, following a 1‚Äì0 away triumph over Crystal Palace. After securing a 4‚Äì2 home win over Stoke City on 31 December, Chelsea recorded a 13th consecutive league victory, equalling Arsenal's 2002 record for most consecutive league wins in a single season. The team's league winning streak came to an end in the following match, on 4 January 2017, in a 2‚Äì0 away loss to Tottenham Hotspur. On 13 January 2017, Conte became the first manager in history to win three consecutive Premier League Manager of the Month awards (October, November and December). On 12 May 2017, Conte's Chelsea side defeated West Bromwich Albion 1‚Äì0 away, with a late goal from substitute Michy Batshuayi, and secured the points required to win the 2016‚Äì17 Premier League title with two matches to spare. Following a 5‚Äì1 home win over Sunderland on 21 May, Chelsea also set a new Premier League record for the most wins in a single season, with 30 league victories out of 38 league matches. On 18 July 2017, Conte signed a new two-year contract with Chelsea, keeping him at the club until 2019. Conte was sent to the stands for the first time in his Chelsea career during the first half of a home match against Swansea City on 29 November 2017. He argued with fourth official Lee Mason over referee Neil Swarbrick‚Äôs decision to award a goal kick rather than a corner for Chelsea, after which the referee dismissed him. Conte apologised afterwards but was nonetheless charged with misconduct by the FA. On 19 May 2018, Conte led Chelsea to a 1‚Äì0 victory over Manchester United in the 2018 FA Cup Final. Chelsea finished fifth in the league at the end of the season, missing out on Champions League qualification. Conte was sacked as Chelsea manager on 13 July 2018 and was replaced by Maurizio Sarri. During this period, the club is said to have lost ¬£26.6m only in paying off compensation to Conte, his team, and legal fees, as per the Chelsea's latest accounts. Inter Milan On 31 May 2019, Conte was appointed head coach of Serie A club Inter Milan. On 26 August 2019, Inter Milan won their first league match of the season with a 4‚Äì0 win against Lecce. Inter finished second behind Juventus in the Serie A title race. Inter also reached the final of the Europa League, but suffered a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Sevilla in Cologne on 21 August 2020. ==Style of management== As a manager, Conte is known for using the 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation (or in certain cases, its more defensive variant, 5‚Äì3‚Äì2), fielding two wingbacks in lieu of wingers, with two out-and-out strikers backed by an attacking box-to-box midfielder in a three-man midfield, in front of a three-man defensive line. During his time as head coach of Juventus, he won three consecutive Serie A titles using the 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation, which also soon began to be employed by several other Serie A clubs. In his time at Bari he was noted for his unorthodox 4‚Äì2‚Äì4 formation, a modification of the classic 4‚Äì4‚Äì2, in which the outside midfielders act as attacking wingers. Some commentators have also observed that, although Conte's teams are capable of playing a short passing possession game, in which the ball is played out from the back on the ground, they are mainly known for their direct style of attacking play, as well as their ability to utilise long balls and score from counter-attacks with few touches; however, Conte has rejected claims that his teams prefer to sit back and play on the counter- attack. Defensive solidity has been highlighted as a hallmark of his sides, as well as the effective use of high and aggressive pressing in order to put pressure on opponents and win back the ball quickly. Conte's teams have also been described as possessing notable virtues such as pace, athleticism, high work-rates, versatility and tactical intelligence. Conte's work in restoring Juventus to the top of Italian football won critical acclaim and earned him comparisons with Jos√© Mourinho, Marcello Lippi and Arrigo Sacchi, primarily due to his obsession with tactics, his winning mentality and ability to foster great team spirit among his players. He also demonstrated a notable tactical versatility and meticulousness as a coach, adopting several different formations in an attempt to find the most suitable system to match his players' skills. The formations he adopted included 4‚Äì2‚Äì4, 4‚Äì1‚Äì4‚Äì1, 3‚Äì3‚Äì4, and 4‚Äì3‚Äì3, before he finally settled on his now trademark 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 or 5‚Äì3‚Äì2 formation while also using a 3‚Äì5‚Äì1‚Äì1 formation on occasion, as a variation upon this system. The resulting system was key to the club's success as the three-man midfield line-up, flanked by wingbacks, allowed veteran star Andrea Pirlo to function creatively as a deep-lying playmaker, with the younger and more dynamic Arturo Vidal and Claudio Marchisio either supporting him defensively or contributing offensively by making attacking runs into the area. Conte's use of heavy pressing high up on the pitch allowed his players to win back the ball quickly after losing it, and enabled Juventus to dominate possession during matches, which gave Pirlo more time to orchestrate the team's attacking moves. The organised back-line at Juventus formed by Chiellini, Bonucci, and Andrea Barzagli proved to be a strong defensive line-up, as Juventus finished the 2011‚Äì12 Serie A season with the best defence in the league; the three-man defence also allowed the central defender, Bonucci, to operate in a free role, and advance into midfield as a ball-playing centre-back, providing an additional creative outlet whenever Pirlo was heavily marked. Luca Marrone commented on Conte's demanding and meticulous approach as a coach, stating, \\"It takes time to accept the sheer amount of work he is asking of you. Everything he does, in preparation or tactical organisation, is done with maniacal precision and attention to detail. It can be overwhelming at first. But when you realise by buying into it you can win things, you follow.\\" In 2014, Trapattoni attributed Conte's success and tactical intelligence as a manager to his time playing in midfield throughout his playing career, which allowed him to understand both the offensive and defensive phases of the game. Conte's teams are also known for their versatility and ability to adopt different formations during a match, depending on whether his team are in possession or playing off the ball. At Euro 2016, Italy adopted a fluid 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation under Conte, in which the wide midfielders or wingbacks effectively functioned as wingers in a 3‚Äì3‚Äì4 formation when attacking, and as fullbacks in a 5‚Äì3‚Äì2 formation when defending behind the ball. Although the level of talent in the Italian squad was initially criticised in the media, Conte's tactics and Italy's solidity and organisation, from both a defensive and offensive standpoint, drew praise from pundits. In his first season as Chelsea manager, Conte started with a 4‚Äì1‚Äì4‚Äì1 formation, but after two comprehensive defeats to Arsenal and Liverpool early in the season, he changed the system to a fluid 3‚Äì4‚Äì2‚Äì1, with his trademark three-man defence consisting of David Luiz, C√©sar Azpilicueta and Gary Cahill, two defensive-minded midfielders in N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matiƒá, two wing-backs equally capable at also playing as wingers (Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso), and a three-man attack spearheaded by striker Diego Costa and crucially assisted by outside forwards Eden Hazard and Pedro or Willian. This system depends on the constant positional movement of attacking players, with the two wide forwards moving inside when the full- backs make overlapping forward runs, thus effectively forming a 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 and at times a 3‚Äì4‚Äì1‚Äì2. When losing the ball, players' quick defensive transitions make the system easily transform into a compact 5‚Äì4‚Äì1. Chelsea's performances improved dramatically after the tactical change, with 13 consecutive wins in the Premier League, and the club eventually went on to win the league title that season. Conte drew praise for his role in revitalising the team in the media, with BBC pundit John Motson describing Chelsea's 5‚Äì0 home win against Everton on 5 November 2016 as the best 90-minute performance he had ever seen in the Premier League. Although Conte's decision to reacquire David Luiz was initially met with criticism in the media, due to some poor defensive performances for Chelsea in the past, Conte's switch to a three-man back-line saw the Brazilian excel in a new role as a ball playing centre-back, due to his technique and range of passing. Conte described David Luiz as being \\"crucial\\" to the team's success, and praised him for working to improve his composure and concentration. In addition to their tactical discipline and organisation, Chelsea also drew praise for their fitness, effective use of high pressing, and their ability to win the ball back quickly, as well as their work-rate under Conte, which was attributed to the team's highly rigorous preseason training, which Cahill described as one of the \\"hardest\\" he has ever experienced. 2017 FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci singled out Conte for his role in motivating the players and creating a unified team environment at Euro 2016, commenting that the players had given their coach the nickname The Godfather, for the way he made them want to listen when he spoke. Pirlo has also remarked approvingly of Conte's man-management and motivational skills. In his autobiography he recalled how Conte's introductory speech to the Juventus squad left a significant impression on him: \\"He needed only one speech, with many simple words, to conquer both me and Juventus. He had fire running through his veins and he moved like a viper. 'This squad, dear boys, is coming off two consecutive seventh-place finishes. It's crazy. It's shocking. I am not here for this, so it's time to stop being so crap.'... When Conte speaks, his words assault you. They crash through the doors of your mind. I've lost count of the number of times I've said: 'Hell, Conte said something really spot-on again today.'\\" In addition to his comparisons to Jos√© Mourinho, some commentators have also remarked on his managerial similarities to Sir Alex Ferguson, using an anecdote from his final season as Juventus manager to illustrate his formidable temper. Prior to the team talk ahead of the final game of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon arrived with the club's chief executive who Buffon claimed wanted to speak to the players over how much they were due in win bonuses having won the title. \\"The suggestion sent Conte into a fury. He chased every player out of the room as he tore into Buffon. 'I don‚Äôt want to hear another word,' Conte is said to have screamed. 'From you, of all people, I would never have expected such a thing. Bonuses ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre a disappointment, a defeat from the moment you open your mouth. Just like all the rest of these half-wits.'\\" Juventus won the game 3‚Äì0 and set a new record for the most points and wins in a single Serie A season. Conte is also known for adopting a very strict approach when it comes to his players' diets and curfew before matches. Marcello Lippi has also praised Conte for his leadership qualities as a manager. ==Controversy== Prior to Euro 2012, Conte was accused of failure to report attempted match-fixing during his time as manager of Siena by ex-Siena player Filippo Carobbio, connected with the betting scandal of 2011‚Äì12. Carobbio, after himself being charged with extensive involvement in the scandal, claimed that during the technical meeting prior to a match between Siena and Novara, Siena owner Massimo Mezzaroma indirectly sent a message to the players asking them to ensure the match finished in a draw in order to help Mezzaroma turn a large profit on a bet he had made. The match finished 2‚Äì2 and Carobbio testified Conte was present when the message was relayed to the players in advance of the match. Carrobio also asserted the result of the final match of the season, in which Siena lost 1‚Äì0 to AlbinoLeffe, was prearranged after Siena's assistant manager asked he and another player \\"contact someone at AlbinoLeffe to reach an agreement over the return match\\". Further accusations were also leveled at Conte over Siena's 5‚Äì0 victory over Varese that season, specifically that he knew they had been asked to lose the game and did not report it. Conte's lawyer, Antonio De Rencis, reported his client strenuously denied the accusations and maintained he had no knowledge of any attempts to fix the matches in which he was involved. To date, none of the 23 other Siena players have supported Carobbio's accusations. Conte took the advice of his lawyers and attempted to strike a plea bargain which would have seen him served with a three-month ban and fine of ‚Ç¨200,000, under Article 23 of Italian law without admission of guilt. On 1 August 2012, this plea bargain was rejected. On 10 August, the FIGC suspended him from football for the following ten months for failing to report match-fixing in the Novara‚ÄìSiena and AlbinoLeffe‚ÄìSiena fixtures. Conte again maintained his innocence and appealed the verdict. On 22 August 2012, the Federal Court of Justice dropped the accusation about the Novara‚ÄìSiena fixture. Federal Court member Pietro Sandulli commented, \\"[I]t seemed illogical that such a senior and experienced coach would say in the locker room 'we're drawing this one' in front of 25 players.\\" However, the Court confirmed the ten-month ban for the AlbinoLeffe match would be upheld as there was no way he could not have known of the actions of his assistant manager Cristian Stellini, with the presiding judge adding that Conte was \\"lucky\\" not to have been handed a longer sentence. On 23 August 2012, Juventus announced an appeal to Italy's sports arbitration panel against the ban. Following the appeal, Conte's touchline ban was reduced to four months. Juventus' management and players dedicated their Supercoppa Italiana win to Conte. In May 2016, the preliminary hearing judge of the court of Cremona acquitted Conte of all charges in regard to his alleged involvement in the match-fixing scandal from the 2010‚Äì11 season, during his time with Siena in Serie B. Despite Conte's success at Juventus, there were indications that his departure from the club in May 2014 was not as amicable as had been portrayed, with observers pointing to a comment he made in the immediate aftermath of the club's 2014 title success. When asked what plans were in place for the following season Conte responded, \\"Well, you cannot go to eat at a ‚Ç¨100 restaurant with just ‚Ç¨10 in your pocket, can you?\\", which was interpreted as a veiled criticism of the lack of funds made available for transfers by the Juventus executive. In addition to this remark, Conte had chosen to resign on the second day of pre-season training, something that took fans by surprise. There was much controversy surrounding Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying match on 28 March 2015 against Bulgaria, as Conte called up Brazilian-born √âder and Argentine-born Franco V√°zquez. Both players hold an Italian citizenship as they have relatives that are Italian, allowing them to be eligible to play for Italy. Speaking at a Serie A meeting on 23 March 2015, Roberto Mancini said, \\"The Italian national team should be Italian. An Italian player deserves to play for the national team while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to.\\" Conte's response to the use of foreign-born players was, \\"If Mauro Camoranesi [who was born in Argentina] was allowed to help Italy win the 2006 World Cup, then why can't √âder and Franco V√°zquez lead the Azzurri to glory in next year's European Championship?\\" In late May 2016, Conte was criticised in the North American media for his omission of Andrea Pirlo and Sebastian Giovinco from Italy's 30-player shortlist for its Euro 2016 squad, and for his comments regarding the quality of their league, Major League Soccer. Conte had stated in a press conference, \\"When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint.\\" On 23 October 2016, while his team were leading 4‚Äì0 against Jos√© Mourinho's Manchester United, Conte waved up the home crowd, asking them to make more noise to support Chelsea. However, media reports claimed his actions were meant to antagonise Mourinho and humiliate the visiting team. Conte refuted these claims, saying, \\"I've been a player too and I know how to behave. I always show great respect for everyone, including Manchester United. There was no incident, it was just a normal thing to do. I wasn't mocking anyone, I wouldn't do that. Today it was right to call our fans in a moment when I was listening to only the supporters of Manchester United at 4‚Äì0. The players, after a 4‚Äì0 win, deserved a great clap. It's very normal. If we want to cut the emotion we can go home and change our job.\\" Although Conte was criticised for his behaviour by Mourinho, Chelsea winger Pedro supported Conte's actions. ==Personal life== Conte and his wife Elisabetta have a daughter, Vittoria. The couple had been together for 15 years before marrying in June 2013. Conte has expressed his gratitude to his family for their support during the Scommessopoli match-fixing scandal investigations in 2011‚Äì12: \\"I have a great woman by my side, one who always tries to understand me. As for my daughter, she is the other woman in my life. She is beginning to understand that her dad gets nervous when he does not win [a match].\\" In addition to his native Italian, Conte can also speak English. Conte is Catholic. ==Career statistics== International Source: {  + Appearances and goals by national team and year - !

Given a strong enough topology on this quotient space, it has the structure of a Hilbert space, and many objects of interest in typical applications fall into this quotient space. An indefinite inner product space is called a Krein space (or J-space) if (x,\\\\,y) is positive definite and K possesses a majorant topology. Krein spaces are named in honor of the Soviet mathematician Mark Grigorievich Krein (3 April 1907 ‚Äì 17 October 1989). == Inner products and the metric operator == Consider a complex vector space K equipped with an indefinite hermitian form \\\\langle \\\\cdot ,\\\\, \\\\cdot \\\\rangle. In the theory of Krein spaces it is common to call such an hermitian form an indefinite inner product. The following subsets are defined in terms of the square norm induced by the indefinite inner product: :K_{0} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in K : \\\\langle x,\\\\,x \\\\rangle = 0 \\\\\\\\} (\\"neutral\\") :K_{++} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in K : \\\\langle x,\\\\,x \\\\rangle > 0 \\\\\\\\} (\\"positive\\") :K_{--} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in K : \\\\langle x,\\\\,x \\\\rangle < 0 \\\\\\\\} (\\"negative\\") :K_{+0} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ K_{++} \\\\cup K_{0} (\\"non-negative\\") :K_{-0} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ K_{--} \\\\cup K_{0} (\\"non-positive\\") A subspace L \\\\subset K lying within K_{0} is called a neutral subspace. Similarly, a subspace lying within K_{+0} (K_{-0}) is called positive (negative) semi-definite, and a subspace lying within K_{++} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} (K_{--} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}) is called positive (negative) definite. A subspace in any of the above categories may be called semi-definite, and any subspace that is not semi-definite is called indefinite. Let our indefinite inner product space also be equipped with a decomposition into a pair of subspaces K = K_+ \\\\oplus K_-, called the fundamental decomposition, which respects the complex structure on K. Hence the corresponding linear projection operators P_\\\\pm coincide with the identity on K_\\\\pm and annihilate K_\\\\mp, and they commute with multiplication by the i of the complex structure. If this decomposition is such that K_+ \\\\subset K_{+0} and K_- \\\\subset K_{-0}, then K is called an indefinite inner product space; if K_\\\\pm \\\\subset K_{\\\\pm\\\\pm} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, then K is called a Krein space, subject to the existence of a majorant topology on K (a locally convex topology where the inner product is jointly continuous). The operator J \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ P_+ - P_- is called the (real phase) metric operator or fundamental symmetry, and may be used to define the Hilbert inner product (\\\\cdot,\\\\,\\\\cdot): :(x,\\\\,y) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\langle x,\\\\,Jy \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x,\\\\,P_+ y \\\\rangle - \\\\langle x,\\\\,P_- y \\\\rangle On a Krein space, the Hilbert inner product is positive definite, giving K the structure of a Hilbert space (under a suitable topology). Under the weaker constraint K_\\\\pm \\\\subset K_{\\\\pm0}, some elements of the neutral subspace K_0 may still be neutral in the Hilbert inner product, but many are not. For instance, the subspaces K_0 \\\\cap K_\\\\pm are part of the neutral subspace of the Hilbert inner product, because an element k \\\\in K_0 \\\\cap K_\\\\pm obeys (k,\\\\,k) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\langle k,\\\\,Jk \\\\rangle = \\\\pm \\\\langle k,\\\\,k \\\\rangle = 0. But an element k = k_+ + k_- (k_\\\\pm \\\\in K_\\\\pm) which happens to lie in K_0 because \\\\langle k_-,\\\\,k_- \\\\rangle = - \\\\langle k_+,\\\\,k_+ \\\\rangle will have a positive square norm under the Hilbert inner product. We note that the definition of the indefinite inner product as a Hermitian form implies that: :\\\\langle x,\\\\,y \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{4} (\\\\langle x+y,\\\\,x+y \\\\rangle - \\\\langle x-y,\\\\,x-y \\\\rangle) (Note: This is not correct for complex-valued Hermitian forms. It only gives the real part.) Therefore the indefinite inner product of any two elements x,\\\\,y \\\\in K which differ only by an element x-y \\\\in K_0 is equal to the square norm of their average \\\\frac{x+y}{2}. Consequently, the inner product of any non-zero element k_0 \\\\in (K_0 \\\\cap K_\\\\pm) with any other element k_\\\\pm \\\\in K_\\\\pm must be zero, lest we should be able to construct some k_\\\\pm + 2 \\\\lambda k_0 whose inner product with k_\\\\pm has the wrong sign to be the square norm of k_\\\\pm + \\\\lambda k_0 \\\\in K_\\\\pm. Similar arguments about the Hilbert inner product (which can be demonstrated to be a Hermitian form, therefore justifying the name \\"inner product\\") lead to the conclusion that its neutral space is precisely K_{00} = (K_0 \\\\cap K_+) \\\\oplus (K_0 \\\\cap K_-), that elements of this neutral space have zero Hilbert inner product with any element of K, and that the Hilbert inner product is positive semi-definite. It therefore induces a positive definite inner product (also denoted (\\\\cdot,\\\\,\\\\cdot)) on the quotient space \\\\tilde{K} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ K / K_{00}, which is the direct sum of \\\\tilde{K}_\\\\pm \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ K_\\\\pm / (K_0 \\\\cap K_\\\\pm). Thus (\\\\tilde{K},\\\\,(\\\\cdot,\\\\,\\\\cdot)) is a Hilbert space (given a suitable topology). == Properties and applications == Krein spaces arise naturally in situations where the indefinite inner product has an analytically useful property (such as Lorentz invariance) which the Hilbert inner product lacks. It is also common for one of the two inner products, usually the indefinite one, to be globally defined on a manifold and the other to be coordinate-dependent and therefore defined only on a local section. In many applications the positive semi-definite inner product (\\\\cdot,\\\\,\\\\cdot) depends on the chosen fundamental decomposition, which is, in general, not unique. But it may be demonstrated (e. g., cf. Proposition 1.1 and 1.2 in the paper of H. Langer below) that any two metric operators J and J^\\\\prime compatible with the same indefinite inner product on K result in Hilbert spaces \\\\tilde{K} and \\\\tilde{K}^\\\\prime whose decompositions \\\\tilde{K}_\\\\pm and \\\\tilde{K}^\\\\prime_\\\\pm have equal dimensions. Although the Hilbert inner products on these quotient spaces do not generally coincide, they induce identical square norms, in the sense that the square norms of the equivalence classes \\\\tilde{k} \\\\in \\\\tilde{K} and \\\\tilde{k}^\\\\prime \\\\in \\\\tilde{K}^\\\\prime into which a given k \\\\in K falls are equal. All topological notions in a Krein space, like continuity, closed-ness of sets, and the spectrum of an operator on \\\\tilde{K}, are understood with respect to this Hilbert space topology. == Isotropic part and degenerate subspaces == Let L, L_{1}, L_{2} be subspaces of K. The subspace L^{[\\\\perp]} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in K : \\\\langle x,\\\\,y \\\\rangle = 0 for all y \\\\in L \\\\\\\\} is called the orthogonal companion of L, and L^{0} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ L \\\\cap L^{[\\\\perp]} is the isotropic part of L. If L^{0} = \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, L is called non-degenerate; otherwise it is degenerate. If \\\\langle x,\\\\,y \\\\rangle = 0 for all x \\\\in L_{1},\\\\,\\\\, y \\\\in L_{2}, then the two subspaces are said to be orthogonal, and we write L_{1} [\\\\perp] L_{2}. If L = L_{1} + L_{2} where L_{1} [\\\\perp] L_{2}, we write L = L_{1} [+] L_{2}. If, in addition, this is a direct sum, we write L= L_{1} [\\\\dot{+}] L_{2}. == Pontryagin space == If \\\\kappa := \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ \\\\dim K_{+}, \\\\dim K_{-} \\\\\\\\} < \\\\infty, the Krein space (K, \\\\langle \\\\cdot,\\\\,\\\\cdot \\\\rangle, J) is called a Pontryagin space or \\\\Pi_{\\\\kappa}-space. (Conventionally, the indefinite inner product is given the sign that makes \\\\dim K_{+} finite.) In this case \\\\dim K_{+} is known as the number of positive squares of \\\\langle \\\\cdot,\\\\,\\\\cdot \\\\rangle. Pontrjagin spaces are named after Lev Semenovich Pontryagin. ==Pesonen operator== A symmetric operator A on an indefinite inner product space K with domain K is called a Pesonen operator if (x,x) = 0 = (x,Ax) implies x = 0. == References == * Azizov, T.Ya.; Iokhvidov, I.S. : Linear operators in spaces with an indefinite metric, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, 1989, . * Bogn√°r, J. : Indefinite inner product spaces, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York, 1974, . * * Langer, H. : Spectral functions of definitizable operators in Krein spaces, Functional Analysis Proceedings of a conference held at Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, November 2-14, 1981, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 948, Springer-Verlag Berlin-Heidelberg-New York, 1982, 1-46, . * * Category:Topological vector spaces Category:Operator theory ","title":"Indefinite inner product space"},{"id":"5571033","text":"Rosary Convent High School is a Roman Catholic missionary private-run girls' school in Hyderabad, India. Established in 1904 by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, it continues to be run by these Missionary Sisters who reside in their convent at the school's grounds. The school was established in response to a need for Catholic girls' education. It became the sister school to All Saints High School, the area's prime Catholic boys' school in those days. These two schools are located on either side of St Joseph's Cathedral in Gunfoundry, Hyderabad, India. The school is run primarily for Catholic girls, however, others are accommodated according to seats available. The school population is primarily made up of Hindus, followed by Muslims, with Christians making up the minority. There is another girls' school adjacent to the St Joseph's Cathedral, Hyderabad, also run by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of Mary named St Joseph's High School, which has a Telugu medium of instruction, where admission is offered for very little or no fees to the poor. St Joseph's School's uniform is similar to that of Rosary Convent, with the exception of a plaid collar and sleeve cuffs, as opposed to the white- collar and sleeve cuffs of the Rosary Convent uniform. This slight difference visually connects the two schools, but it also serves the purpose of the easy transformation of donated Rosary Convent school uniforms into St Joseph's school uniforms. ==Education== Rosary Convent High School instructs students up to the 10th standard and prepares students for the SSC (Class 10) Matriculation Examination. The medium of instruction is English. Activities include Religion and Moral Science, Communications, Drama, General Knowledge (Debate), Dance, Art, and Music. Training and activities are also provided in sports including karate, gymnastics, badminton, tennis, basketball, volleyball, skating, aerobics and yoga. ==School history== Situated in Gunfoundry (so-called for the ammunition center built by the Nizam of Hyderabad), the school began on January 1904 with a student-body of 60 taught in the Tamil language, and 50 pupils taught in English. The FMM nuns visited the surrounding homes, pleading with parents not to deny their children the benefits of schooling. At a time when education was believed to be the right of only upper castes and males, the nuns had a difficult time convincing the locals to send their children to school. Soon, the conservative society of Hyderabad came to trust these foreign sisters, sending their daughters to the school. Today the school has grown to a strength of more than 3000 students. Rosary Convent High School celebrated its centennial anniversary with a year- long celebration that began on 26 January 2003 and culminated with Holy Mass and a Valedictory public function and felicitation in January 2004. ==See also== *Education in India *Matriculation *Matriculation (India) *Tenth Grade (India) *List of schools in India *List of institutions of higher education in Telangana == External links == *Official Website Category:Franciscan high schools Category:Catholic secondary schools in India Category:Christian schools in Telangana Category:Girls' schools in Telangana Category:Private schools in Hyderabad, India Category:High schools and secondary schools in Hyderabad, India Category:Educational institutions established in 1904 ","title":"Rosary Convent High School"},{"id":"5571035","text":"Maus Gatsonides (1964) Maurice \\"Maus\\" Gatsonides (February 14, 1911 in Gombong, Kebumen Regency - November 29, 1998 in Heemstede) was a Dutch rally driver and inventor.

He represented several Italian clubs throughout his career, in particular Torino and Lazio, where he won various titles. At international level, he represented the Italian national team in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the final. He holds the longest unbeaten streak in Lazio's history, as well as the joint seventh-highest unbeaten streak in Serie A, alongside Gianluigi Buffon, having gone 745 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal in the Italian top division. ==Club career== After beginning his professional career with Jesi in 1986, for one season in the lower divisions, and subsequently Brescia for a season, in Serie B, Marchegiani spent the majority of his career at Torino F.C. and S.S. Lazio. With Torino (1988‚Äì1993), he won the Coppa Italia in 1993, and a Serie B title and a Mitropa Cup in 1991, earning promotion to Serie A; he also finished runner-up in the 1993 Supercoppa Italiana and the 1991‚Äì92 UEFA Cup, and managed a third-place finish in Serie A during the 1991‚Äì92 season, whilst playing for the club. At one point in his career, Marchegiani was the most expensive goalkeeper in the world, when he joined Lazio from Torino in 1993 for ¬£6m;¬£9m custodian who breaks football's No 1 rule during this period he was regarded as one of the best and most reliable goalkeepers in Italy and in world football. During his time with Lazio he won the Serie A, two Italian Cups, two Italian Supercups, an UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and an UEFA Super Cup, also reaching another UEFA Cup Final in 1998. In 2003, he moved to and ended his playing career at Chievo Verona, where he remained until retiring in 2005. ==International career== Marchegiani played for Italy national football team on 9 occasions between 1991 and 1996. He was initially selected by Arrigo Sacchi as the successor of the former first-choice keeper Walter Zenga, but lost his place after a mediocre performance in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Switzerland during the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification: he conceded the first goal, scored by Christophe Ohrel, after failing to catch a cross, an unusual mistake for him, and then poorly controlled a back-pass with his feet, enabling the opposing striker St√©phane Chapuisat to score for the second time. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup he was selected as Italy's second-choice keeper behind Gianluca Pagliuca, who was more skilled with the ball at his feet, but still managed to play three matches:FIFA Player Statistics: Luca Marchegiani his first appearance was as a substitute against Norway, following the sending off of Pagliuca, coming on for Roberto Baggio, and helping the 10-man Italian squad to keep a clean sheet and win the match 1‚Äì0; he also appeared in the final group match against Mexico (a 1‚Äì1 draw), and in the 2‚Äì1 extra-time victory over Nigeria in the round of 16. Despite Marchegiani's excellent performances, which led some pundits to advocate his confirmation, Pagliuca recovered the starting spot after his two-game disqualification, and played the remaining games. Italy reached the final, where they lost to Brazil on penalties. ==Style of play== A consistent, elegant, intelligent, composed and complete goalkeeper, Marchegiani is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of his generation. He was known in particular for his agility, positional sense, reactions, and his speed when rushing off his line, as well as his efficient technique, reliable handling, movement, and his ability to read the game; in particular, he stood out throughout his career for his outstanding ability to come out and claim crosses and high balls. In addition to his shot-stopping abilities, he was also remembered for his professionalism, as well as his dedication. In spite of his reserved character, he was a resolute goalkeeper, who inspired confidence in his defenders. Although he was not particularly adept or confident with the ball at his feet following the establishment of the back-pass rule, and did not have a particularly powerful or deep goal kick, he possessed excellent vision, and later worked to improve this aspect of his game throughout his career. He was also effective at stopping penalties: in his career, he stopped 18 penalties in Serie A from 69 attempts in 422 appearances between 1988 and 2005, with a career save percentage of 26.1%; he has saved the fourth‚Äìhighest number of penalties in Serie A history.

Known as the \\"Atlas\\", HMLAT-303 trains newly commissioned Naval Aviators, conversion pilots, and refresher pilots to fly the Bell UH-1Y Venom and Bell AH-1Z Viper. HMLAT-303 is also responsible for training Bell UH-1Y Venom crew chiefs. It is part of Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). ==Mission== The Mission of Marine Helicopter Light Attack Training Squadron 303 is to provide qualitative and productive training to Replacement Aircrew (RAC), Refresher, Transition and Conversion pilots, as well as Bell UH-1Y Venom crew chiefs. This training is provided in the newly upgraded AH-1Z and UH-1Y helicopters. RAC students entering the training syllabus are newly designated Naval Aviators from the Naval Air Training Command in Pensacola, Florida. Refresher students are Fleet Marine Force Aviators returning from shore duty billets or military schools. Transition students are Fleet Marine Force Aviators qualified in other aircraft. Crew Chiefs are enlisted personnel who will act as aerial observers and gunners aboard the UH-1Y. This command also instructs refreshers and RACs through intraservice and international exchange programs. ==History== Marine Light Attack Helicopter Training Squadron 303 (HMLAT-303) was activated with four officers and three enlisted Marines on April 30, 1982. Today the squadron has grown to over 400 Marines and 45 aircraft. Based at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, California, HMLAT-303 conducts an extensive training syllabus to include: familiarization, navigation, ordnance, terrain, formation, instrument and night vision goggle flight. The squadron periodically deploys to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, where training efficiency is enhanced due to the proximity of ordnance delivery ranges and superb weather conditions.

After the LaserJet 5 series, however, HP introduced a new naming convention for its LaserJet line. While the LaserJet 5L and 5P were replaced with the LaserJet 6L and 6P, there was never a LaserJet 6; the successor to the LaserJet 5/5M/5N/5se line was the LaserJet 4000 series, and the successor to the LaserJet 5si/5siMX/5siNX was the LaserJet 8000 series.

This is twice the official capacity of 66MB. Use of the PostScript module will reduce the total maximum memory to 100MB due to the fact that the PostScript module takes up a memory slot and has only 4MB of RAM used in printing. The 72-pin SIMMs must also be 32-bit, no parity, with presence detect enabled, and 70ns or slower.http://www.printermemory.net/hp_laserjet_legacy.html 5P Unofficial memory capacity The hp LaserJet 5N can unofficially support 32MB 72pin SIMM modules with parity (24 chip modules tested), allowing a maximum 98MB of memory to be installed. This is nearly twice the official capacity of 50MB. Powering up the machine with additional installed 96MB takes 59 seconds due to the extended memory test. 5Si Network Connection The LaserJet 5Si comes without a network adaptor, but an expansion slot is provided, and the firmware supports network printing. If an added network card can not be enabled, reset the printer to default factory settings - to do this, power off the printer, press and hold the online button and switch on the printer. Allow the printer to fully boot, then release the button. The printer is now reset to factory defaults, and the network configuration should now work. 5L Printing Issues *The 5L model sometimes doesn't print portions of the page or prints blurred letters. This is because the page being printed is taking up more memory than the printer has available. The solution is to either lower the resolution from 600√ó600 dpi to 300√ó300 dpi, install and use the 4L driver to print to the 5L printer, or install more memory using the expansion slot. *If part of a page is replaced by lines (or, sometimes, a blank space like above), and then printed on another page, this is because of low memory. Typically, the 5L will give an error before this occurs (i.e. it will stop printing and turn on only the amber error light, but will continue if you hit the button). There are memory cards you can buy and install into the printer to solve this problem. *The 5L, 6L; and 3100 and 3150 all had an issue with multiple paper- feed jams which was resolved via class action lawsuit, the remedy of which was to freely supply an easily insertable replacement pad. The free supply of the Replaceable Separation Pad Kit has since expired but they can be found on eBay. *The 5L, 6L didn't support a page count after the printer was powered down, the page count reset back to zero on a power cycle. 5/5N/5M/5Si Jetdirect cards  These printers have an expansion slot which can be used with a JetDirect card for I/O expansion. The most common cards in the surplus market are the J2550, J2552, J2556 and J4100. Unfortunately none of these support any form of USB. ==References== 5 ","title":"HP LaserJet 5"},{"id":"5571101","text":"The National Senior Certificate or NSC is a high school diploma and graduate certificate of South Africa. This certificate is commonly known as the matriculation (matric) certificate, with grade 12 as the matriculation grade. The NSC, previously known as the Further Education and Training Certificate or FETC, replaced the Senior Certificate effectively in 2008, was phased in starting with grade 10 in 2006. == Curriculum == Students study at least seven subjects: each of the two compulsory official South African languages, either Mathematics or Mathematical Literacy, Life Orientation, and three elective subjects. Students have the option of either taking the NSC (National Senior Certificate) or the NCV (National Certificate Vocational). == Standards == Subjects are taken on the same level ‚Äì the earlier higher/standard grade split is obsolete. The three pass levels have different requirements. The higher certificate requires 40% or higher in the home language as well as in two other subjects and at least 30% in three other subjects. Students who pass the matric with a higher certificate level cannot enroll for a university degree nor a diploma at any institution of higher learning. The mean mark in any subject is approximately 55. Only a small proportion of candidates score an 'A' in any subject (from as little as 2% to a maximum of about 10% in subjects taken by highly select groups). A further 8 ‚Äì 15% are likely to gain a 'B' and about 20 ‚Äì 25% achieve a 'C' grade. The National Senior Certificate is a group certificate and records an aggregate mark. == Regulations == The Department of Basic Education is responsible for general educational policy to be implemented by nine provincial education departments and private providers such as the Independent Examinations Board (IEB). Nine provincial examination boards and three independent boards, of which the IEB is the biggest examine students. The IEB operates on a national level, catering primarily to independent schools. == Subject requirements == Students study at least 7 subjects: 4 compulsory and 3-4 optional. All subjects are set at one grade only and are no longer set at Higher or Standard Grade. Not all schools offer the full range of elective subjects as listed here. Each school may offer subjects specific to its academic orientation. For example, agriculture schools will offer agriculture-oriented subjects whereas technical schools will offer practical and mechanical-oriented subjects.  Group A: Fundamentals (Compulsory)  Learners must study 4 compulsory subjects: *Two of the official languages of South Africa: **Afrikaans **English **Indebele **Northern Sesotho **Southern Sesotho **Swazi **Tsonga **seTswana **Venda **isiXhosa **isiZulu * Mathematics, Mathematical Literacy or Technical Mathematics *Life Orientation  Group B: Electives  Learners must also study at least 3 subjects from the following: *Accounting *Agricultural Management Practices *Agricultural Sciences *Agricultural Technology *Business Studies *Civil Technology *Computer Applications Technology (previously Computer Studies Standard Grade - Literacy) *Consumer Studies *Dance Studies *Design *Dramatic Arts *Economics *Electrical Technology *Engineering Graphics & Design *Geography *History *Hospitality Studies (previously Home Economics) *Information Technology (previously Computer Studies Higher Grade - Programming) *Life Sciences (previously Biology) *Mechanical Technology *Music *Physical Science *Religion Studies *Second Additional Language *Third Additional Language *Tourism *Visual Arts == Question paper == Life Orientation (colloquially abbreviated as \\"LO\\") has been introduced into the senior high school phase as an examination subject and is designed to cover non-academic skills needed in everyday life such as: *World of Work, helping learners find guidance in their choice of career and prepare them for the working world *Health Education, topics such as sex education, HIV/Aids talks, pregnancy, etc. *Physical Education, physical exercise and training (done on a separate basis but eventually forms part of the Life Orientation mark) *Religious Education, helps guide students on their paths toward choosing a nationally required faith (as mandated by the South African Schools Act). Students may request to be exempted from classes about specific religions, i.e. Bible Studies; those who do so remain obligated to attend the general Religious Studies class. *Citizenship and Responsibility, explain to students their rights and duties as citizens. == Assessment == There are three types of subjects: General Subjects  *An end-of-year examination: 75% of the total mark *Portfolio (Continuous Assessment): 25% of the total mark  Practical Subjects  *An end-of-year examination: 50% of the total mark *Portfolio (Continuous Assessment): 25% of the total mark *Practical component: 25% of the total mark  Language Subjects  *An end-of-year examination: 50% of the total mark *Portfolio (Continuous Assessment): 25% of the total mark *Oral Examination: 25% of the total mark Continuous Assessment (CASS) includes all the tests, examinations, tasks, activities, orals and projects done throughout the year. Results are usually out of 400 marks. == Level system (1 to 7) == * Level 7: 80 - 100% (Outstanding achievement) * Level 6: 70 - 79% (Meritorious achievement) * Level 5: 60 -69% (Substantial achievement) * Level 4: 50 - 59% (Moderate achievement) * Level 3: 40 - 49% (Adequate achievement) * Level 2: 30 - 39% (Elementary achievement) * Level 1: 0 - 29% (Not achieved - Fail) == Language compensation == Language compensation attempts to adjust for the difficulties faced by students whose mother tongue is neither English nor Afrikaans. It is described by several sources: \\"To the final mark is added the language compensation, which is 5% of the mark attained by the candidate for all non-language subjects, for candidates whose mother tongue is not English or Afrikaans. The 5% compensates learners for the disadvantage suffered by these candidates being instructed in a language that is not their mother tongue.\\" [Written reply to a parliamentary question in 2011 SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY: QUESTION 757, DATE OF PUBLICATION OF INTERNAL QUESTION PAPER: 11/03/2011 (INTERNAL QUESTION PAPER: 06/2011)] \\"The compensation applies to learners whose first language is neither English nor Afrikaans and who offer an African language as their first language. They receive an additional 5% on their non-language subjects. The measure was first introduced in 1999 by the South African Certification Council.\\" [Written reply to a parliamentary question in 2007,SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY: WRITTEN REPLY TO QUESTION 469, DATE OF PUBLICATION IN INTERNAL QUESTION PAPER: 26-03-2007 (INTERNAL QUESTION PAPER NO.: 10-2007)] Dr. Sizwe Mabizela, Chairperson of Council, Umalusi has provided a further explanation:Politics web, 3 January 2011, \\"Umalusi explains matric mark adjustments\\", Dr. Sizwe Mabizela, 03 January 2011 \\"This is the most misunderstood concept in this country. In terms of the policy on language compensation, learners who offer an African language as Home Language and do not offer Afrikaans or English as Home language qualify for a 5% language compensation on the mark they have obtained in a non-language subject. For example a learner who obtains a mark of zero (0) out of 300 will obtain 5% of zero (which is zero) for language compensation; a learner who obtains 10 out of 300 will receive 5% of 10, which is 0,5 marks, for language compensation; a learner who obtains 100 out of 300 marks will obtain an additional 5 marks for language compensation.\\" This kind of compensation impacts pass rates, but provides a significant impact at the upper end of the scale, affecting those applying for admission to university. For example, a qualifying learner obtaining 95% would receive 95 x 1.05 = 99.75% (which rounds to 100%). A learner obtaining 40% would receive 40 x 1.05 = 42.0%. == University entrance == In addition to minimum grades required in each subject, universities either set their entrance tests and/or use the National Benchmark Tests (NBT). To study for a bachelor's degree at a South African university requires that the applicant has at least an NSC endorsed by Umalusi, with a pass of 30% in the chosen university's language of learning and teaching, as well as a level 4 or higher in the following list of designated, 19-credit subjects: * Accounting * Agricultural Sciences * Business Studies * Dramatic Arts * Economics * Electrical Technology * Engineering Graphics and Design * Geography * History * Consumer Studies * Information Technology * Languages (one language of learning and teaching at a higher education institution and two other recognized language subjects) * Life Sciences * Mathematics * Mathematical Literacy * Music * Physical Sciences * Religion Studies * Visual Arts == See also == *High school#South Africa *Matriculation in South Africa *Independent Examinations Board == References External links== *Department of Education official site * Category:Education in South Africa Category:Secondary school qualifications ","title":"National Senior Certificate"},{"id":"5571105","text":"SAFTAG is the primary fish tagging program in South Australia.

Industry is continually synthesizing new chemicals, the regulation of which requires evaluation of the potential danger for human health and the environment. Risk assessment is nowadays considered essential for making these decisions on a scientifically sound basis. Measures or defined limits include: *No effect concentration (NEC), No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC), No-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) *Lowest- observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) *Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL)thefreedictionary.com/AOEL Retrieved on June 19, 2009 *ECx (in percent) ==No effect concentration== No effect concentration (NEC) is a risk assessment parameter that represents the concentration of a pollutant that will not harm the species involved, with respect to the effect that is studied. It is often the starting point for environmental policy.Bruijn et al., 1997, Chen & Selleck 1969 There is not much debate on the existence of an NECVan Straalen 1997, Crane and Newman 2000 but the assignment of a value is another matter. Current practice consists of the use of standard tests. In the standard tests groups of animals are exposed to different concentrations of chemicals and different effects such as survival, growth or reproduction are monitored. These toxicity tests typically result in a No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC, also called a No Observable Effect Level or NOEL). This NOEC has been severely criticized on statistical grounds by several authorsSuter 1996, Laskowski 1995, Kooijman 1996, Van der Hoeven 1997 and it was concluded that the NOEC should be abandoned.OECD Document No 54 of \\"Series on Testing Assessment\\", 2006 ==ECx== A proposed alternative is the use of so-called ECx ‚Äì the concentration(s) showing x% effect (e.g. an EC50 in a survival experiment indicates the concentration where 50% of the test animals would die in that experiment). ECx concentrations also have their problems in applying them to risk assessment. Any other value for x other than zero may give the impression that an effect is accepted, and this is in conflict with the aim of maximally protecting the environment.Bruijn et al. 1997 In addition ECx values do depend on the exposure time.Kooijman 1981, Jager et al. 2006 ECx values for survival decrease for increasing exposure time, until equilibrium has been established. This is because effects depend on internal concentrations,Kooijman 1981, P√©ry et al. 2001a and that it takes time for the compound to penetrate the body of test organisms. However, sub-lethal endpoints (e.g., body size, reproductive output) may reveal less predictable effect patterns in time.Alda Alvarez et al. 2006 The shape of the effect patterns over time depends on properties of the test compound, properties of the organism, the endpoint considered and the dimensions in which the endpoint is expressed (e.g., body size or body weight; reproduction rate or cumulative reproduction). ==Biology-based== Biology-based methods not only aim to describe observed effects, but also to understand them in terms of underlying processes such as toxicokinetics, mortality, feeding, growth and reproduction (Kooijman 1997). This type of approach starts with the description of the uptake and elimination of a compound by an organism, as an effect can only be expected if the compound is inside the organism, and where the No Effect Concentration is one of the modeling parameters. As the approach is biologically based it is also possible by using Dynamic Energy Budget theoryKooijman, 2000 to incorporate multiple stressors (e.g. effects of food restriction, temperature, etc.)Heugens, 2001, 2003 and processes that are active under field conditions (e.g. adaptation, population dynamics, species interactions, life cycle phenomena, etc.).Sibly and Calow (1989) The effects of these multiple stressors are excluded in the standard test procedures by keeping the local environment in the test constant. It is also possible to use these parameter values to predict effects at longer exposure times, or effects when the concentration in the medium is not constant. If the observed effects include those on survival and reproduction of individuals, these parameters can also be used to predict effects on growing populations in the field.Kooijman 1997, Hallam et al. 1989 ==References== Inline Bibliography *Alda Alvarez, O., Jager, T., Nunez Coloa, B. and Kammenga, J.E.

A motte-and- bailey castle is thought to have previously occupied the site and the present structure was built by the bishops of the Diocese of St David in the 13th century. The castle was abandoned in the 16th century and some of the stone was removed for local building projects. The site is privately owned by the Lord of the Manor of Llawhaden and managed by Cadw. ==Description== The ruins of Llawhaden Castle stands on a hill overlooking the River Cleddau,Oman (1926): p. 211 and is located in the Pembrokeshire village of Llawhaden, some 10 miles east of Haverfordwest. The remaining ruins date from the early 13th century. It is surrounded by a ditch, which was designed to be only crossable by a drawbridge. The castle is pentagonal in shape and while the north-western and western sides of the castle are no longer present, the other three sides remain. The gatehouse is located on the southern side, which is formed of two drum towers and a gateway. This was also where the drawbridge would have been located to allow entrance to the interior of the castle.Oman (1926): p. 212 The ruins are managed by Cadw, and are open to the public. ==History== Llawhaden and its hinterland were lands owned by the Bishopric of the Diocese of St David, since at least the later years of the realm of Deheubarth. Following the Norman conquest of Deheubarth, these lands (of which Llawhaden and its hinterland were a detached part) became the Marcher Lordship of Dewisland, ruled by the Bishops;Judgement in Crown Estate Commissioners v (1) Mark Andrew Tudor Roberts (2) Trelleck Estate Ltd: ChD (Mr Justice Lewison), 13 June 2008 it was the only ecclesiastically-ruled Marcher Lordship. Marcher Lords had such great authority that they were almost sovereign.Francis Jones, The Lordship and Manors of Dewsland in Journal of the Historical Society of the Church in Wales, Volume 16, page 15 The first Norman Bishop, Bernard, constructed a castle on the site in the year that he was appointed - 1115. Only a moat and an earth bank from this period survive, although it is thought to have been a motte-and-bailey castle. The stone-built building came later; the vast majority of the ruins seen today date from the construction commissioned by Bishop Adam de Houghton between 1362 and 1389. This was much grander, with two suites of residences situated on the first floor. The gate house shown in the picture was probably added at a later date.Cadw information board outside the Castle. Additions continued to be made to the castle into the early years of the reign of Henry VIII of England. Llawhaden Castle ruins The building fell into decline under the control of Bishop William Barlow, the first Bishop appointed after Henry's Laws in Wales Acts had abolished Marcher Lordships. Barlow was an ardent Church Reformist, whose appointment had been encouraged by Thomas Cranmer, and who was significantly unenamoured with St. Davids and its traditions. Barlow sold the lead from the castle roof, supposedly to pay for the dowry of one of his daughters, resulting in damage to the rest of the building from which it never recovered. After the dissolution of the monasteries (which met no resistance from Protestant reformists like Barlow), the castle was completely abandoned, falling into disrepair; it was subsequently quarried for building stone. Llawhaden Castle Gatehouse today In 1930, George Lansbury, then First Commissioner of Works in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, organised a party of 1,300 previously unemployed men for six months to do renovation work on several castles. Llawhaden Castle was among those worked on, with several tasks undertaken including digging out moats and ditches, as well as removing ivy and undergrowth. ==NotesReferences== * == External links == * Cadw website entry on Llawhaden Castle * Castle Explorer: Llawhaden Castle Category:Castles in Pembrokeshire Category:Castle ruins in Wales Category:Grade I listed castles in Wales Category:Grade I listed buildings in Pembrokeshire Category:Scheduled monuments in Pembrokeshire ","title":"Llawhaden Castle"},{"id":"5571138","text":"The Fortifications Interpretation Centre in Valletta, Malta An interpretation centre, interpretive centre, or visitor interpretive centre is an institution for dissemination of knowledge of natural or cultural heritage. Interpretation centres are a kind of new-style museum, often associated with visitor centres or ecomuseums, and located in connection to cultural, historic or natural sites. Interpretation centres use different means of communication to enhance the understanding of heritage. To aid and stimulate the discovery process and the visitor's intellectual and emotional connection to heritage, the main presentation strategy tends to be user-friendly and interactive, and often use scenographic exhibitions and multimedia programs. Many interpretation centres have temporary exhibitions related to a specific aspect of the site. Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre An interpretation centre can be a viable solution for effective communication of heritage information in municipalities and rural areas where resources may not exist to establish a traditional, full- scale museum, and where heritage can be an important factor for tourism development. Unlike traditional museums, interpretation centres do not usually aim to collect, conserve and study objects; they are specialized institutions for communicating the significance and meaning of heritage. They work to educate and raise awareness. Non-core jobs as conservation and research are services usually done by specialized, external entities. ==See also== * Nature centre * Heritage interpretation * Science centre * Interpretive planning ==References== Category:Types of museum Category:Hermeneutics Category:Cultural heritage Category:Interpretation Category:Environmental interpretation ","title":"Interpretation centre"},{"id":"5571143","text":"The official Casual Courier, Inc. logoThe Casual Courier, Inc.

The parent force of the AAFC is the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Along with the Australian Army Cadets (AAC) and the Australian Navy Cadets (ANC) it is part of the Australian Defence Force Cadets. ==Aims== The broad aim of the Australian Air Force Cadets is to better equip young people for community life by fostering initiative, leadership, discipline and loyalty through a training program designed to stimulate an interest in the Royal Australian Air Force. The training program is structured to reflect the following objectives: * To give Cadets a foundation of Air Force knowledge and discipline; * To develop the qualities of leadership, initiative and self-reliance; * To develop good character and good citizenship in the widest sense; * To develop an interest in the Royal Australian Air Force and aviation generally; * To instill a knowledge of the history of aviation; and * To encourage Cadets to continue an active interest in aviation into their adult life. ==AAFC activities== Australian Air Force Cadets wearing winter formal uniform, parade at the memorial outside St John's Ashfield Cadets receive the opportunity to participate in a wide range of activities such as: *Home Training * Bivouacs (Bush Camps) * Australian Defence Force service rifles training * Gliding and Powered Air Experience and Training *Abseiling * General Service Training Camps * Promotion Courses (with reservations) *Parades and Marches ‚Äì Drill and Ceremonial * Unmanned Aerial Vehicles * Rocketry * Aeromodelling *National Competitions *International Air Cadet Exchange ==Ranks== RAAF rank slides prior to issue of \\"newer style\\" AAFC blue/white striped DPCU rank slides. It would be around 2014 when these would be fully replaced. The ranks of the Australian Air Force Cadets (AAFC) are closely based on the ranks of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). As such, a system of differentiation was required to distinguish members of the AAFC from those of the RAAF. This means that cadet ranks wear rank slides which are AFB (Air Force Blue) with an embroidered light blue ribbon, 1 cm wide at the base of the rank slide with 'AAFC' in AFB embroidery. Adult members of the AAFC wear rank slides with an embroidered white bar that contains the letters AAFC in place of the light blue bar. When DPCU uniforms became standard issue, cadets and cadet staff would wear surplus Australian RAAF and Australian Army Rank slides. These would be replaced in 2014 with the \\"AAFC\\" styled DPCU rank slide. Adult ranks are also followed by the letters AAFC (in brackets) when written, to distinguish them from actual members of the RAAF. Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer ranks are prefixed with the letter C, to identify them as cadets and not adult staff or members of the RAAF. A new cadet is initially enrolled with the rank of Cadet and after completing prescribed training and length of service, they are eligible for reclassification to the rank of Leading Cadet. Subsequent promotions are achieved by completing two week training courses known as a promotion courses along with meeting time-in-rank and minimum age requirements and receiving a recommendation for promotion from the cadet's Commanding Officer. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\\" + class=\\"nowrap\\"  Ranks and Insignia of the Australian Air Force Cadets  } * Recruit (RCT) is not an official rank, but commonly refers to new cadets who have been enrolled but have not yet finished the Recruit Stage of Home Training. {  + Instructor Ranks of the AAFC (Instructor of Cadets ‚Äì IOC)Volume 2, Part 1, Chapter 1 of the AAFC Manual of Management ! width=\\"100\\" scope=\\"col\\" Rank Slide ! width=\\"100\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC AC.jpg ! width=\\"100\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC LAC.jpg ! width=\\"100\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC CPL.jpg ! width=\\"100\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC SGT.jpg ! width=\\"100\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC FSGT.jpg ! width=\\"100\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC WOFF.jpg - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Rank  align=\\"center\\"  Aircraftman (AAFC)/ Aircraftwoman (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Leading Aircraftman (AAFC)/ Leading Aircraftwoman (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Corporal (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Sergeant (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Flight Sergeant (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Warrant Officer (AAFC) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Abbreviation  align=\\"center\\"  AC(AAFC)/ACW(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  LAC(AAFC)/LACW(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  CPL(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  SGT(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  FSGT(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  WOFF(AAFC) } {  + Officer Ranks of the AAFC (Officer of Cadets ‚Äì OOC) ! width=\\"140\\" scope=\\"col\\" Rank Slide ! width=\\"140\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC PLTOFF.jpg ! width=\\"140\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC FLGOFF.jpg ! width=\\"140\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC FLTLT.jpg ! width=\\"140\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC SQNLDR.jpg ! width=\\"140\\" style=\\"background-color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC WGCDR.jpg ! width=\\"140\\" style=\\"background- color: #ffffff;\\"  File:Rankslide AAFC GPCAPT.jpg - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Rank  align=\\"center\\"  Pilot Officer (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Flying Officer (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Flight Lieutenant (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Squadron Leader (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Wing Commander (AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  Group Captain (AAFC) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Abbreviation  align=\\"center\\"  PLTOFF(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  FLGOFF(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  FLTLT(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  SQNLDR(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  WGCDR(AAFC)  align=\\"center\\"  GPCAPT(AAFC) } Cadet Ranks  GST  GST training is a four day course that allows for cadets to learn the basics of the RAAF and experience minor military training. This course primarily contains, Service Knowledge Basic, Fieldcraft, Aircraft Recognition, Drill and Ceremonial. Depending on which base that the training is conducted will decide on the other electives involved. Junior Cadet Ranks Junior ranks comprise the ranks of Cadet (CDT) and Leading Cadet (LCDT) as well as the informal title of Recruit (RCT). AAFC issued PH299 \\"Blue Books\\" prior to use of ID cards. These ceased use around 2016 in regional units. (Newer version on the left, older version on the right). Cadets join the AAFC as recruits at the rank of Cadet (CDT) and commence Cadet Recruit Stage training which comprises the subjects Drill and Ceremonial, Service Knowledge, and Fieldcraft. Cadet Recruit Stage may include a teambuilding weekend or training weekend. Recruits receive their PH299 'blue book' (a form of identification carried at all times by cadets) and uniforms some time during Cadet Recruit Stage. Cadet Recruit Stage usually takes 6 months to complete. The Blue Book has been replaced as the form of cadet & staff identification by a Photo ID card issued to all Cadets & Staff annually and using the Blue Book to record training and activities has been replaced by the online CadetNet system. Upon completion of the Recruit Stage of training, CDTs begin Basic Stage. Basic Stage, on average, takes 6 months to fully complete. By completing Basic Stage, a cadet will begin Proficiency Stage and is eligible for reclassification to the rank of Leading Cadet (LCDT). A LCDT rank slide features a single inverted chevron. A LCDT does not outrank a CDT, though, they are thought of as a more experienced cadet and are provided with more leadership opportunities than a CDT would. Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer (CNCO) Ranks Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) ranks are Cadet Corporal (CCPL), Cadet Sergeant (CSGT), Cadet Flight Sergeant (CFSGT) and Cadet Warrant Officer (CWOFF). = Cadet Junior Non-Commissioned Officer (CJNCO) Ranks = Any LCDT can apply for the Junior Non-Commissioned Officer Course. A cadet's Commanding Officer (CO) reviews the LCDT's application, and, if successful, endorses their application. This allows the LCDT to attend a promotion course (held during school holidays) conducted by their parent wing. The Junior Non-Commissioned Officer (JNCO) courses generally last for 11 days and are held at a RAAF base, depending on availability. At the end of a promotion course, the course commander grades the LCDT as either recommended or not recommended for promotion to the rank of CCPL. If recommended for promotion, a CO should promote the LCDT to the rank of CCPL as soon as practicable. = Cadet Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (CSNCO) Ranks = Australian Air Force Cadet Corporals wearing \\"summer blues\\" summer formal uniform doing practice drills during a SNCO course. Any CCPL can apply for the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Course but must have held that rank for a minimum of five months before being able to attend the promotion course. They go through much the same process, though more rigorous, as do prospective JNCOs. SNCO courses typically last for 15 days and are also held at a RAAF base, often concurrently with a JNCO course. Promotion is as for JNCOs. Having been recommended for promotion by the course commander, promotion is at the discretion of the CCPL's CO as soon as practicable. After six months as a CSGT, a cadet may be promoted to the rank of CFSGT by their CO. This does not require the CSGT to attend a wing promotion course. Many COs require their prospective CFSGTs to demonstrate the ability to lead a team of SNCOs. Often Cadet Flight Sergeants are treated as 'executive' members of the Squadron and are given duties to match (activity planning, squadron organisation etc.), along with Cadet Warrant Officers and Cadet Under Officers; although they are still distinctly a Cadet Senior Non-Commissioned Officer. Cadet Warrant Officers (CWOFF) and Cadet Under Officers (CUO) A Cadet Warrant Officer (CWOFF) is the most senior of the NCO ranks but most squadrons consider this to be a \\"Senior Cadet\\" due to the privileges and responsibilities it has. In order to attend a CWOFF course, a cadet must be a SNCO and have completed their JNCO course not later than 16 months before the commencement of the CWOFF course. The CWOFF course generally lasts for 15 days as well and are conducted at a RAAF base. CWOFF courses conducted by the AAFC primarily cover leadership and supervision particularly focusing on the maintenance of morale, cadet welfare and discipline. Due to the role of a CWOFF often being that of the Squadron Warrant Officer, the course has a significant weighting towards Drill and Ceremonial and service protocol. Cadets promoted to the rank of CWOFF are addressed as Sir, Ma'am or Warrant Officer. Cadets, staff and defence personnel of a high rank generally will address the CWOFF by their rank and last name e.g. \\"Warrant Officer Bloggs\\", whilst subordinate ranks will address the CWOFF as Sir or Ma'am depending on their gender and, are too also allowed to address the CWOFF as \\"Warrant Officer Bloggs\\". The ranks of CWOFF and Cadet Under Officer (CUO) are usually considered to be senior cadet ranks due to large increase of duties and privileges the two ranks have. In order to attend a CUO course, a cadet must be a SNCO and have completed their JNCO course not later than 16 months before the commencement of the CUO course. CUO courses are the longest, running for 17 days, also at a RAAF base. The rank of CUO is the highest attainable by a cadet and is designed to give the cadet experience in the role of an officer. To this end, the course is heavy in leadership and management related subjects in addition to the drill required to be an officer. CUOs are addressed by all cadets below their rank as Sir or Ma'am, as applicable, and are saluted. Rank Establishments The AAFC has specific rank establishments depending on the strength of a squadron. This is to ensure a balance between leadership roles and subordinates members (especially to prevent a top-heavy squadron developing). As an exaggerated example, it would not be beneficial for a squadron of 40 cadets to have 39 CUOs and 1 CDT, nor would it be beneficial for it to have 20 CWOFFs, 10 CFSGTs and 10 CSGTs. Rather, that squadron ought to have 2 CUOs, 2 CWOFFs, 1 CFSGT, 3 CSGTs, 5 CCPLs and around 30 LCDTs/CDTs. The general standard is 1‚Äì4 NCOs and CUOs. The following table outlines cadet establishments for AAFC squadrons:AAFC Standing Orders Issue 2/2010 (10 Apr) { + Cadet Ranks of the AAFC !width=\\"50\\" SQN Cadet Establishment !width=\\"50\\" CUO !width=\\"50\\" CWOFF !width=\\"50\\" CFSGT !width=\\"50\\" CSGT !width=\\"50\\" CCPL - 10‚Äì30  1  2  1  2  4 - 31‚Äì40  2  2  1  3  5 - 41‚Äì50  3  2  2  3  6 - 51‚Äì60  3  2  2  4  7 - 61‚Äì70  4  2  2  5  9 - 71‚Äì80  5  3  3  5  10 - 81‚Äì90  5  3  3  6  11 - 91‚Äì100  5  3  3  7  12 - 101‚Äì110  5  3  4  7  13 - 111‚Äì120  5  4  4  8  14 - 121‚Äì130  5  4  4  9  16 - 131‚Äì140  6  4  5  9  17 - 141‚Äì150  6  4  5  10  18 } * Squadrons may not exceed the establishment for CUO and CWOFF positions. CUO positions do not cascade down to CWOFF positions if there are vacancies in the CUO numbers. * Squadrons may use vacancies in CFSGT and CSGT positions to cascade down to lower ranks to permit COs the option to fill vacancies in SNCO ranks with JNCOs. * Vacancies in rank cannot cascade upwards at any time. * This means that vacant CCPL positions remain that way at all times, and, for example, a squadron with establishment for 75 cadets that has only 3 CSGTs could not assign those positions to CUO/CWOFF/CFSGT rank but could assign them to allow for more CCPLs. * Since the introduction of CadetNet as the AAFC's primary management system there is no limit imposed by CEA on rank establishments however the establishment is still followed by most COs. Cadet Phases of Training A cadet progresses through five phases of training during their cadet career. {  + Insignia of Training Phases !width=\\"200\\" Phase !width=\\"200\\" Insignia -  Cadet Recruit  No insignia -  Basic  No insignia -  Proficiency  Three-bladed propeller badge for wear on Service Dress -  Advanced  Four-bladed propeller badge for wear on Service Dress -  Qualified  Silver Eagle badge for wear on Service dress, replaces both Prof and Advanced badges - } Propeller refers to a round gold pins with a propeller-blade symbol printed in service blue, worn centrally of the right breast pocket flap above the button. Staff Promotion A person may be enrolled as an Instructor of Cadets (IOC) at the age of 18 and as an Officer of Cadets (OOC) at the age of 19, though most begin their career as an IOC. Ex-cadets are recommended to wait a minimum of 12 months before returning as a staff member. Upon appointment as an IOC, the staff member is normally given the rank of AC/ACW(AAFC). Any new staff members who were a cadet and held the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer or Cadet Under Officer, within the last 5 years, are eligible for the rank of LAC/LACW(AAFC). Ex-ADF members may also be appointed at higher ranks than AC/ACW(AAFC), to recognise their previous rank/service in the ADF. Current ADF members may also be appointed at different ranks, as no member is permitted to have dual mess status (i.e. may only be permitted to eat/sleep in ONE of the Airmens' Mess, Sergeants' Mess or Officers' Mess). * An ADF PTE(E)-CPL(E) can only be an AAFC AC(AAFC)-CPL(AAFC) * An ADF SGT(E)-WO1(E) can only be an AAFC SGT(AAFC)-WOFF(AAFC) * An ADF officer can only be an AAFC officer * Since the ranks WOFF(AAFC), SQNLDR(AAFC), WGCDR(AAFC) and GPCAPT(AAFC) are not substantive ranks in the AAFC, senior airmen and senior/air officers may only be given the highest substantive rank of FSGT(AAFC) or FLTLT(AAFC) unless the member also holds a senior airmen/officer appointment. AAFC staff members who join the ADF may have their rank changed to fit these criteria. This may include reversion in rank (e.g. PLTOFF or FSGT to CPL) or \\"promotion\\" (e.g. LAC or SGT to PLTOFF). The promotion to a commissioned officer rank is not automatic ‚Äì the member is terminated as an instructor, and their application for an officer appointment is assessed. AAFC staff in the ADF do not need to have exactly the same rank in both the ADF and AAFC; their ranks are just required to adhere to the above criteria. Promotion is less frequent than that of cadets, as there is no upper age limit for staff. The minimum time in rank requirements between promotions is three years, with the exception of promotion from AC/ACW(AAFC) to LAC/LACW(AAFC), LAC/LACW(AAFC) to CPL(AAFC) or from PLTOFF(AAFC) to FLGOFF(AAFC) in addition to other staff training requirements. The minimum time in rank requirement for AC/ACW(AAFC) to LAC/LACW(AAFC) is one year; from LAC/LACW(AAFC) to CPL(AAFC) is two years; and from PLTOFF(AAFC) to FLGOFF(AAFC) is two years; and from FLGOFF(AAFC) to FLTLT(AAFC) is three years.

Each year the Royal Australian Air Force awards the \\"Australian Air Force Cadets ‚Äì Air Force Trophy\\". The winner of the Air Force Trophy is honoured with the custodianship of the AAFC National Banner for the following year. ==Wing Cadet Reference Group== 45px * Role of the Cadet Reference Group: The role of the CRG is to provide a forum where cadets within SQNs can provide feedback on matters that affect them and can receive information being passed down from OCs and COs. The CRG should contribute to the management decisions within its SQN and Wing by providing a cadets‚Äô perspective to their CO or OC, through their nominated representative, when the leadership team is considering issues that directly impact on cadets.\\"Direction and Role of the Cadet Reference Group\\" (CDR ADMIN 2/2010) * The Cadet Reference Group (CRG) is a cadet body within the Australian Air Force Cadets (AAFC) established to represent the views of AAFC Cadets to the strategic level of management. * There should be two representatives from each Squadron (flights do not have any representatives), a Cadet Reference Group Representative (CRGREP) and an Assistant Cadet Reference Group Representative (ASSTCRGREP). * Senior Cadets (CUO & CWOFF), and Cadet Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (CSNCO) ‚Äì CWOFF, CFSGT & CSGT ‚Äì will normally fulfill the CRGREP role for their Squadron whilst a CCPL to CDT would fulfill the ASSTCRGREP role. * The Squadron CRGREPs & ASSTCRGREPs report to their Wing CRG Executive (Chairman Wing Cadet Reference Group [CWCRG] & Deputy chairman Wing Cadet Reference Group [DCWCRG]). 2 & 3 Wings are broken down into regions: North, South, West & Metro(3 Wing). In these regions CRGREPs & ASSTCRGREPs report to their respective Regional Representatives who in turn report to their Wing's CRG Executive. * The Wing CRG chairman is responsible for providing representation to the management of the Wing by reporting to the Wing Officer Commanding, in some wings the CRG. ==Command and structure== The AAFC organisation as a whole falls under the command of Headquarters AAFC (HQAAFC). HQAAFC has no physical location as it is made up of members from around the country. The only person to hold the rank of Group Captain (AAFC) is the Commander of the Australian Air Force Cadets (CDR-AAFC). The CDR-AAFC reports to the Director General Cadets ‚Äì Air Force, a member of the RAAF who holds the rank of Air Commodore, and in turn reports to the RAAF chain of command. Under HQAAFC are the Operational Wings and Directorates, each headed by a WGCDR(AAFC) who holds the appointment of Officer Commanding (OC) or Director respectively. Cadet squadrons only exist within the Operational Wings. They report to the Operational Wing Officer Commanding (often through an Executive Officer) and are commanded by a Commanding Officer. A squadron Commanding Officer (CO) will hold the rank of PLTOFF(AAFC), FLGOFF(AAFC) or FLTLT(AAFC) unless the officer holds another appointment which entitles them to a more senior rank, some squadrons are commanded by a WOFF(AAFC). There are 8 Operational Wings for all states and territories, however the state of Queensland is divided into two Wings. There are also eight directorates to serve a support function for operational wings: Aviation Operations Directorate (AOD), Corporate Services Directorate (CSD), Diversity Directorate (DIVD), People and Culture Directorate (PCD), Operations Directorate (OPSD), Safety Directorate (SAFD), Training Directorate (TD). As of 1 April 2005, a Squadron's establishment no longer justifies a CO to hold the rank of SQNLDR(AAFC) rank. However, it is still possible to have a CO of SQNLDR(AAFC) or even WGCDR(AAFC) rank, but only if that CO holds a wing or national position e.g. Officer Commanding, Director, Staff Officer or Deputy Director position in Wing or National HQ in addition to their appointment as a Squadron CO. There are a number of key appointments within Wing Headquarters, including; {  - ! Appointment !! Abbreviation !! Rank -  Executive Officer*  XO  SQNLDR (AAFC) -  bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  *Some wings have a regional appointment with the region appended to the title. e.g. Executive Officer (South) (XOS). -  Staff Officer Training*  SOT  SQNLDR (AAFC) -  bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  *Some wings have specific appointments with the speciality appended to the title. e.g. Staff Officer Ground Training (Squadron) (SOGT(SQN)). -  Staff Officer Management Services SOMS  SQNLDR (AAFC) -  Senior Aviation Officer SAO  FLTLT (AAFC) ‚Äì SQNLDR (AAFC) -  Wing Warrant Officer  WGWOFF  WOFF (AAFC) -  bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  *Some wings have a regional appointment with the region appended to the title. e.g. Wing Warrant Officer (South) (WGWOFF(S)). -  Regional Executive Instructor*  RXI  SGT (AAFC) ‚Äì FSGT (AAFC) -  bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  *Some wings have regional appointments with the region appended to the title e.g. Regional Executive Instructor (West) (RXIW). -  Chairman Wing Cadet Reference Group  CWCRG  CSGT ‚Äì CUO } There are also a large number of other positions such as Administration Officer, Psychologist, Chaplain and various other training and administrative appointments. Larger Wings may have more executive and other appointments. Each Wing has an Air Force Liaison Officer (AFLO), a RAAF officer (often a reservist) who is responsible for all activities requiring RAAF support for that region, amongst other duties. Airmen/women and junior officers are posted to an individual squadron (as per a squadron's size) as instructors of cadets (IOC) and officers of cadets (OOC). The AAFC incorporates a National Cadet Reference Group, comprising eight Wing Chairs under the direction and leadership of a Chairman of the NCRG and Deputy Chairman of the NCRG. This is the peak representative and advisory body acting on behalf of the cadets to the higher echelons of the organisation. The chairman is a default member of several groups through virtue of their appointment including the tri-service Cadet Consultative Forum, the AAFC Executive Council and the National Council among others. ==AAFC Home Training== There are five stages of AAFC Home Training, each Training Stage has a number of subjects. Cadet Recruit stage This training stage is designed to give cadets fundamental knowledge required to participate in AAFC Home Parades and Activities. The course should take between two and six months and should include at least one weekend of training. Subjects in the Cadet Recruit Stage include drill, team building, and fieldcraft. Basic stage This training stage is designed to take a cadet with fundamental knowledge and build on this to the point where the cadet is proficient at most basic activities. Completion of this stage also makes cadets eligible for reclassification to the rank of Leading Cadet. Subjects in Basic Stage include aircraft recognition, drill, and fieldcraft. Proficiency Stage This training stage is designed to be completed one year. Proficiency Stage comprises three compulsory core subjects and three elective subjects. Subjects in Proficiency Stage include drill, aircraft recognition, fieldcraft, and survival skills. Advanced Stage This stage of training is designed to provide cadets with extensive knowledge about the RAAF and the AAFC. Advanced Stage comprises three compulsory core subjects plus three other subjects. Qualified Stage To complete Qualified Stage cadets are to complete a mix of Projects and Elective subjects. The mix of electives and projects may be: Qualified Stage cadets who have Squadron duties such as instructing, administration, or supervising junior cadets may have these duties recognised in lieu of elective subjects in the form of a generic subject labelled Squadron Management Elective. Projects are substantial multi-media presentations that may be individual or team efforts. Projects should be relevant to ADF or AAFC themes. Electives Electives subjects include personal development, adventure training, aviation recognition, aircraft modelling, air navigation, air traffic control, field operations, fire safety, firearms training, life saving, meteorology, engineering, model rocketry, and radio communications. == AAFC RAAF Base Training == Every cadet that shows potential may apply for training held on active military bases.  Powered Flight Training (PFT)  PFT can be held either on civilian or military owned airfields and is usually held for two to three weeks.. An example includes, 2 Wing Flight training, which is held at RAAF Base Amberely on the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk. These Cadets are trained on a variety of aircraft and are taught the basics of flight. They are trained to complete a solo circuit by the end of the course.  Promotional Courses  During these courses, cadets are taught qualities required of the position they are attaining to. These courses vary and can be held in a multitude of military bases within Australia including Borneo Barracks, RAAF Base Willamtown and RAAF Base Amberely. ==Drill and Ceremonial== AAFC training constitutes much Drill and Ceremonial training, ranging from basic static drill in recruit phase to advanced banner, Rifle and sword drill on officer courses. Each parade night a \\"squadron daily parade\\" is held (daily for RAAF SQNs, weekly for AAFC SQNs) in which all cadets participate, with CNCOs and above assuming executive position of Flight Sergeant (CCPL), Flight Commander (CSGT/CFSGT), Parade Warrant Officer (CWOFF), Parade Commander (CUO) and often Reviewing Officer (CUO). Lower ranks may hold these positions where there are insufficient senior cadets. Squadrons also hold CO's Parades (usually once a month but not always) where staff go on parade and the squadron is inspected by the Commanding Officer. AAFC squadrons often form guards and banner parties at Anzac/Remembrance Day/Victory in the Pacific Day/Vietnam Veterans Day services and other cadets will march on these parades. Promotion course graduation parades are very significant events, often requiring days of training. These parades will often be reviewed by a senior RAAF officer and consist of a number of squadrons/flights as well as colour parties. Graduation parades will generally be armed (usually SNCO candidates, but can consist of lower and higher ranks in some cases) with Lee Enfields, L1a1 rifles, or F88 Austeyrs, the Standard Individual Weapon of the Australian Defence Force (often issued the F88I submodel ‚Äì meaning innocuous and older variants of F88) and swords for executives. Colour party members are often temporarily issued ceremonial equipment such as White cotton gloves, Banner Girdle (for Banner/Colour Bearer) or Sash (Banner/Colour Warrant Officer) and white belts. ==Major Activities== National Competitions HQAAFC holds three National Competitions throughout the year, they are: * National Fieldcraft Competition (NFCC) ‚Äì Held in April of each year at Puckapunyal Training Area in Victoria (Australia). * National Rifle Competition (NRC) ‚Äì Held in September each year at various locations (such as Sydney International Shooting Centre). * National Aviation Competition (NAC) ‚Äì (formerly known as NATFLY) Held in December (previously October) of each year on RAAF Bases around the country, both Power and Gliding competitions take place.  Wing Competitions  Wings may also hold their own competitions throughout the year and are similar to national competitions. International Air Cadet Exchange (IACE) The International air Cadet Exchange (IACE) Program came into being in 1947 when Canada and the UK arranged a bi-lateral exchange of air cadets between the two countries. The AAFC currently exchanges with the following countries: * United States * Canada * United Kingdom * Hong Kong * Singapore * New Zealand * France * Republic of Korea (second year) * Netherlands == Minor Activities ==  Airshows  Cadets are given the ability to appear at local airshows and military expos depending on location of the unit. For Example, 228 Squadron located in Bundaberg, sent a flight of cadets to the Bundaberg Airshow of 2009. Cadets can take up roles such as assistance to security and catering.  Charities  Cadets assist local communities by holding and assisting in charity events, one such event including Relay for Life. These also consist of donations to military supportive organisations such as Legacy. Sometimes Senior Cadets plan these events.  Bivouacs  AAFC units commonly partake in camping activities called 'bivouacs' and allow cadets to learn fieldcraft, leadership and teamwork prior to a promotional course. These can last from a weekend to a week. ==Memorials== Australia's has two memorials to the Australian Air Force Cadets. The first occupies a prominent position on the grounds of St John's Ashfield, and a memorial service attended by the Cadets has been held annually since it was opened by the State Governor Lieutenant General John Northcott in 1946. It was built by Squadron Leader Arthur Whitehurst who had commanded a squadron at Ashfield during the period 1941‚Äì1946, and whose son Douglas Arthur Whitehurst had died in action in World War II. The second is a plaque unveiled in 1981 as part of a commemoration parade on the fortieth anniversary of the Australian Air Force Cadets' predecessor the Air Training Corps. The plaque is located at the base of a tree adjacent to the south west path leading from the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, Victoria. Each Cadet Squadron has an association with a local Returned Servicemans League (RSL) branch and Squadrons participate in local ceremonies such as ANZAC & Remembrance Day Marches with their RSL Branch. == Firearms == Australian Air Force Cadets being trained to use the \\"BRNO\\" ZKM-452 Standard. Chambered in .22 LR. This is ideal for firearms training due to low cost of ammunition and low weight.  Currently in use:  *Cz452 *Cz453 *Cz455 *ZKM 452  Formerly used:  * Lee Enfield (retired 2010) (Still used during military drill) * Cadet Issue Martini Henry (retired 1970s) * L1a1 (retired 2013) (Still used during drill in some cases where the Lee Enfield is not available) * F88 (Still used in drills, this was used during the late 2000's and early 2010's for firearms training) ==Aircraft and Gliders== Schleicher Ka-7.

This seaside town was created by architect Fran√ßois Spoerry in the 1960s by modifying the marshes of the river Giscle on the bay of Saint-Tropez. Built with channels in a Venetian manner, but with French \\"fisherman\\"-style houses resembling those in Saint- Tropez, Spoerry called his style \\"L'architecture douce\\".https://www.boutemy.net/en/port-grimaud The town is also known as the \\"Venice of Provence\\". The mostly traffic-free town is popular with boat owners, as most properties include their own berth. The success of the first phase of the development meant that Port Grimaud 2 (extending the town further east) was completed in the 1970s and Port Grimaud 3 in the 1990s. The local church, the L'eglise ≈ìcum√©nique Saint-Fran√ßois d‚ÄôAssise (the Ecumenical Church of St Francis of Assisi) in the Place de L'√©glise (Church Square), was also designed by Spoerry and contains stained glass by Victor Vasarely.

The formal names of election commissions vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may be styled an electoral commission, a central or state election commission, an election board, an electoral council or an electoral court. Election commissions can be independent, mixed, judicial or executive. They may also be responsible for electoral boundary delimitation. In federations there may be a separate body for each subnational government. The election commission has a duty to perform election related activities in an orderly manner. For election related problems, Election Commission is responsible. ==Electoral models== Independent model In the independent model the election commission is independent of the executive and manages its own budget. Countries with an independent election commission include Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, India, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the United Kingdom. In some of these countries the independence of the election commission is constitutionally guaranteed e.g. section 190 of the Constitution of South Africa. Branch model In the branch model the election commission is often called an electoral branch, and is usually a constitutionally-recognized separate branch of government, with its members appointed by either the executive or the legislative branch. Countries with an electoral branch include Bolivia, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Mixed model In the mixed-model there is an independent board to determine policy, but implementation is usually a matter for an executive department with varying degrees of supervision by the independent board. Countries with such a model include Cameroon, France, Germany, Japan, Senegal and Spain. Executive model In the executive model the election commission is directed by a cabinet minister as part of the executive branch of government, and may include local government authorities acting as agents of the central body. Countries with this model include Denmark, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia. In the United States, elections for federal, state, and local offices are run by the executive branch of each state government - see, for example, the Division of Elections of the Florida Department of State. Judicial model In the judicial model the election commission is closely supervised by and ultimately responsible to a special \\"electoral court\\". Countries with such a model include Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. ==List of election commissions== *Afghanistan: Independent Election Commission *Afghanistan: Election Complaints Commission *Albania:

November 1924) co-founded the Cass Sculpture Foundation. ==Biography== Wilfred was born in Berlin and comes from the famous Jewish Cassirer family. His great uncle, Paul Cassirer, was an important dealer for the impressionists in Europe. His grandfather was Richard Cassirer, the famous German brain surgeon and his other great uncles included a publisher, industrialist and the philosopher, Ernst Cassirer. After the war, Wilfred worked as junior research engineer for Telephone Rentals in Knightsbridge, London (1946-7) before embarking on an HND in Communication Technology at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London between 1947‚Äì51. In 1979, Wilfred and his son, Mark, set up Image Bank UK - part of The Image Bank and this company was successfully sold to Getty Images in 2001. In 1987 Wilfred became Chairman and Chief Executive of Moss Bros Plc where he reorganised the whole of the troubled group including moving and selling its head office, starting up a new range of Suit Shops and buying Cecil Gee Plc. He remained at the company until 1991. Upon retiring from Moss Bros in 1992, Wilfred moved to West Sussex from London where he co-founded the registered charity, The Cass Sculpture Foundation (previously known as Sculpture at Goodwood) in 1992. Over the next year, they visited some thirty sculpture parks around the world before deciding upon the style, aim and design of their own estate. Long-term friends of Henry Moore and Elisabeth Frink, Wilfred and Jeannette sold their own personal collection of Moores, Frinks and Ayrtons, which they had bought directly from these artists, to fund the creation of their park. Based in Goodwood, West Sussex, the charitable foundation's aim and consistent focus is to promote and advance British sculpture to a global audience and through a vigorous programme of commissioning, funding and marketing, the Foundation has enabled the fabrication of 150 major new works by leading British artists. In 1996, the charity won the National Art Collections Fund prize for \\"Promoting Enjoyment of the Visual Arts\\". Cass was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 17 June 2006. In April 2008 Cass was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University. In 2014, aged 90, Wilfred lives in the grounds of the Cass Sculpture Foundation's sculpture park in Goodwood, near Chichester, West Sussex, with his wife Jeannette. ==Portraits of Wilfred Cass== The National Portrait Gallery collection includes a portrait of Wilfred and Jeannette Cass by Anne-Katrin Purkiss.National Portrait Gallery - Person - Wilfred Cass In 2008 Cass sat for a portrait sculpture in terracottaportrait of Wilfred Cass by Jon Edgar which is in the collection of the sitter and was exhibited at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 2013http://www.ysp.co.uk/exhibitions/jon-edgar-sculpture-series-heads as part of the Sculpture Series Heads.Sculpture Series Heads - Terracotta Portraits of Contributors to British Sculpture (2013) Hall, P., Scott, M. & Pheby, H. ==See also== * The Guardian * The Telegraph ==References== * Frances Follin, 'Wilfred Cass, co-Founder of the Cass Sculpture Foundation, is 90!', in Cassone: The International Online Magazine of Art and Art Books, November 2014 http://www.cassone-art.com/magazine/article/2014/11/wilfred-cass-champion-of- british-sculpture/?psrc=perspectives ==See also== * Wilfred Cass' Full Biography at Sculpture.org.uk * Cass Sculpture Foundation official site Category:English art collectors Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Alumni of the University of Westminster Category:German Jews Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom Category:1924 births Category:Living people ","title":"Wilfred Cass"},{"id":"5571221","text":"Kevin is a common male first name of the Irish origin.

The Quartet has recorded over 200 works and has toured internationally for well over half a century, making it one of the longest enduring major string quartets. In its history, the Quartet has had two leaders: Leonard Sorkin, from 1946 to 1981, and Ralph Evans, from 1982 to the present. Its current members are violinists Ralph Evans and Efim Boico (who have been playing together in the Quartet since 1983), violist Gil Sharon, and cellist Niklas Schmidt. ==History== Although the Fine Arts Quartet was founded in 1946, the group's members had begun working together as early as 1939 while playing in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The Quartet's first performance took place in 1940 with Leonard Sorkin, Ben Senescu, Sheppard Lehnhoff, and George Sopkin. Military service in World War II intervened, however, and it was not until 1946, now with the new second violinist Joseph Stepansky, that the Quartet began to rehearse and perform regularly. The Quartet members have helped nurture many young international ensembles. Their first teaching residency, 1951‚Äì1954, at Northwestern University, was followed by a 55 year residency, 1963-2018 (concluded in January 2018), as Quartet-in-Residence at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. In 1982, Leonard Sorkin founded the Chamber Music Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and became its first director and served in that capacity until his death in 1985. The Quartet members have also been guest professors at the national music conservatories of Paris and Lyon, the Royal Academy and Royal College of Music in London, the summer music schools of Yale University and Indiana University, and at music festivals world-wide. They have appeared as jury members of major competitions such as Evian, Shostakovich, and Bordeaux. Documentaries on the Fine Arts Quartet have appeared on both French and American public television. ==Early recordings and performance== The Quartet performed on the ABC Radio Network's Sunday morning broadcasts from 1946 until 1954. In the mid-fifties, there was an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, performances on the Today Show, and starting in 1958, the Quartet began to tour Europe annually. In the late sixties, the United States Department of State sponsored the Quartet's tours to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, and by the late seventies, the Quartet had performed in 270 cities in 28 countries. The Quartet continued to broadcast for radio in America (especially for WFMT- Chicago), in Europe (e.g. the BBC), and for television (concerts and educational programs for National Public Television). The Quartet released over 100 works during its first 30 years of existence, including cycles of chamber music by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahms, on such labels as Decca, Vox, Vanguard, Saga, and Concert Disc. The Quartet also performed contemporary music in performances, commissions, and recordings, and helped to make composers such as Bart√≥k, Shostakovich, Bloch, Babbitt, Wuorinen, Martinon, Hindemith, Shifrin, Crawford-Seeger, Johnston, and Husa better known and accessible to the public. Their recordings of the six quartets of B√©la Bart√≥k followed a television series featuring a performance of each, preceded by interviews and commentary by the performers, with musical illustrations. The quartet was an advocate of what was then still comparatively unfamiliar and avant-garde repertoire. == Recent recordings == The Quartet's extensive discography includes releases of the piano quartets and quintets of Saint-Sa√´ns and Schumann, the string quartets of Zimbalist and Kreisler, \\"Harmonies du Soir\\" by Ysa√øe for quartet and string orchestra, clarinet quintets by Bernard Herrmann and David del Tredici, the two Saint- Sa√´ns string quartets, three Beethoven string quintets, the Franck string quartet and piano quintet, the two Faur√© piano quintets, the complete Bruckner chamber music (including his string quartet and quintet), quartets by American composers (Antheil, Herrmann, Glass, Evans), the complete Schumann string quartets, the two Mendelssohn string quintets, chamber music by Glazunov, the complete Dohn√°nyi string quartets and piano quintets, the complete Mozart String Quintets, and the complete Op.18 Beethoven quartets. A complete discography is listed below. ==Recognition== The Quartet's Faur√© quintets CD on Naxos with pianist Cristina Ortiz was among the five recordings for which music producer Steven Epstein won a Grammy Award in 2010 (\\"Producer of the Year, Classical\\"). It was also named a \\"Gramophone award-winner and recording of legendary status\\" in the 2012 Gramophone Classical Music Guide. Its Glazunov, Mendelssohn, and Faur√© CDs were each named a \\"Recording of the Year\\" by Musicweb International in 2007, 2008, 2009, respectively. Their \\"Four American Quartets\\" album was designated a \\"BBC Music Magazine Choice\\" in 2008. The Quartet's Schumann CD was called \\"one of the very finest chamber music recordings of the year\\" by the American Record Guide in 2007, and its box set of the complete Mozart string quintets, released by Lyrinx in SACD format, was named a \\"Critic's Choice 2003\\" by the American Record Guide. Special recognition was given for the Quartet's commitment to contemporary music: a 2003-2004 national CMA/ASCAP Award for Adventurous Programming, given jointly by Chamber Music America and the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers. == Membership history == 1st Violin: * Leonard Sorkin (1946‚Äì1982) * Ralph Evans (1982‚Äìpresent) 2nd Violin: * Joseph Stepansky (1946‚Äì1954) * Abram Loft (1954‚Äì1979) * Lawrence Shapiro (1979‚Äì1983) * Efim Boico (1983‚Äìpresent) Viola: * Sheppard Lehnhoff (1946‚Äì1952) * Irving Ilmer (1952‚Äì1963) * Gerald Stanick (1963‚Äì1968) * Bernard Zaslav (1968‚Äì1980) * Jerry Horner (1980‚Äì2000) * Michael Strauss (2000‚Äì2001) * Yuri Gandelsman (2001‚Äì2008) * Chauncey Patterson (2008‚Äì2009) * Nicol√≤ Eugelmi (2009‚Äì2013) * Juan-Miguel Hernandez (2014‚Äì2018) * Gil Sharon (2018‚Äìpresent) Violoncello: * George Sopkin (1946‚Äì1979) * Wolfgang Laufer (1979‚Äì2011) * Robert Cohen (2012‚Äì2018) * Niklas Schmidt (2018‚Äìpresent) ==Discography (1947‚Äì2020)== *Adler Quartet No.6 (1975), CRI SD-432 (rec 1979) *Antes Trio No.1, Columbia masterworks AMS 6741 (rec 1964) *Antes Trio No.2, Columbia masterworks AMS 6741 (rec 1964) *Antes Trio No.3, Columbia masterworks AMS 6741 (rec 1964) *Antheil Quartet No.3, (1948), Naxos CD 8.559354 (rec 2007) *Arriaga Quartet No.1, SWR10116 (rec 1996) *Arriaga Theme and Variations, Op.17, SWR10116 (rec 2005) *Babbitt Quartet No.3, M&A;

At the age of ten he spent a year in Istanbul crossing the Bosporus daily to go to school. Marlow was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1960, spending four years in BAOR - including time as troop commander of the, then, only amphibious bridging troop, retiring as a Captain in 1969. ==Parliamentary career== After leaving the army he was employed in management consultancy and commercial development.Before he entered the House, Marlow unsuccessfully fought Normanton in February 1974 and Rugby in October 1974. He gained Northampton North at the 1979 election, defeating the Labour MP Maureen Colquhoun. Subsequently, he had a reliably Eurosceptic voting record, voting against the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, as well as against the entry of Spain and Portugal into the EEC. He was one of the eight Conservative MPs who had the party whip withdrawn for opposing a confidence vote, called during the debates on Maastricht Treaty. Together with other rebels, he supported an ultimately successful Labour amendment which set the level of VAT on fuel at half the government's proposed level, a rate that remains to this day. After losing the whip for his rebellion over the Maastricht Treaty, Marlow endorsed John Redwood's unsuccessful challenge to John Major for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1995. He was for many years Chairman of the UK Palestine All Party Group, leading and organising delegations to meet Yasser Arafat and to visit Southern Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza strip. With Professor Alan Woodruff of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Marlow campaigned against dog nuisance based on the dangers arising from Toxocara canis, initiating the Parliamentary campaign through the introduction of a ten-minute rule bill. Marlow was Chairman of the Crossrail Private Bill Committee [the last such committee]. Although impressed by the concept, at the time demand for urban travel in London was declining with increasingly sophisticated electronic communications leading to a progressive closure of back offices. It also became apparent that sufficient Treasury funding was unlikely to be forthcoming and that had the Bill been agreed, large parts of east London would have been threatened with planning blight. The Committee voted against the Bill. He was censured by the then-speaker Betty Boothroyd for referring to Harriet Harman as a \\"stupid cow\\" during a debate about mad cow disease on 25 March 1996.https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960325/debtext/60325-06.htm Marlow lost his seat in the 1997 election to Labour's Sally Keeble. Since leaving Parliament Marlow has been farming in West Wales with a flock of sheep, 70 pure bred Limousin cattle, arable and woodland - over 100 acres of which he has planted.

In October 2004 the organisation began in London with funding from private donors in Germany, Switzerland, USA and the UK. Since 2006, the organisation headquarters is based in Hamburg, where the World Future Council is politically independent and operates and is registered as a charitable foundation. Further offices are located in London, Geneva and Windhoek. The Council meets once a year at the Annual General Meeting. ==The Hamburg Call to Action== The Hamburg Call to Action was unanimously agreed upon by all Councillors present at the Founding Ceremony of the World Future Council, 9‚Äì13 May 2007. It calls for the preservation of the environment and the health of communities, the promotion of \\"systems and institutions based on equity and justice\\", safeguarding traditional indigenous tribal rights, the protection of present and future generations from war crimes and crimes against humanity, a sustainable production, trade, financial and monetary system, the revival of local democracies and economies, and a universal ban on nuclear and depleted uranium weapons, cluster ammunition and landmines. It aims to generate governmental support for renewable energy technologies, the protection of forests and oceans, secure healthy food and water supplies, environmental security, healthcare, education and shelter, and a strengthened United Nations. ==Activities== thumb Future Policy Award The Future Policy Award (FPA) celebrates policies that create better living conditions for current and future generations. The aim of the award is to raise global awareness for these exemplary policies and speed up policy action towards just, sustainable and peaceful societies. The Future Policy Award is the first award that celebrates policies rather than people on an international level. Each year the World Future Council chooses one topic on which policy progress is particularly urgent. In 2009, the Future Policy Award highlighted exemplary policies foro food security. In the International Year on Biodiversity, the Future Policy Award 2010 celebrated the world's best biodiversity policies. In the International Year of Forests, the Future Policy Award 2011 celebrated successful policies that protect, enhance and sustainably utilize forests for people, and thus contribute to a better world. In 2012, the Future Policy Award celebrated the world's most inspiring, innovative and influential policies on the protection of oceans and coasts. In 2013 the question was which existing disbarment policies contribute most effectively to the achievement of peace, sustainable development, and security? In 2014the Future Policy Award was dedicated to policies that address one of the most pervasive human rights abuses that humanity is facing: violence against women and girls. The Future Policy Award in 2015 committed to policies that contributed to protecting and strengthening the rights of boys and girls. The 2017 Future Policy Award was dedicated to policies that effectively addressed land and soil degradation, and the related risks to food security and livelihoods, and help secure a sustainable and just future for people living in the world's drylands. In 2018, the FPA ‚Äì often referred to as the \\"Oscar on best policies\\" celebrated the world's best policies scaling up Agroecology; the Indian state Sikkim was awarded Gold. FuturePolicy.org The website futurepolicy.org website presents political solutions and assists decision-makers in developing and implementing future just policies. It is an online database designed for policy-makers to simplify the sharing of existing and proven policy solutions to tackle the world's most fundamental and urgent problems. It now contains policies, for example on renewable energies, energy efficiency, sustainable cities and food production in the era of climate change, that have been promoted in WFC publications, films and hearings. Zanzibar International Children Rights Conference From 28-30 November 2017, the World Future Council hosted an international child rights conference in Zanzibar to explore the positive impacts of Zanzibar's Children's Act and share success stories on child protection, children friendly justice and participation from around the world. The Zanzibar Children's Act had received the Gold Future Policy Award in 2015. Across three days, over 100 participants took part in a varied schedule of workshops, presentations and field visits looking at how to translate child rights laws onto paper into national and location programmes that improve the experiences of children and young people on the ground and effectively tackle child abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The conference was convened with the support of Janina √ñzen-Otto, the JUA Foundation, and the Michael Otto Foundation. The conference closed with the Zanzibar Declaration on Securing Children's Rights, signed by over 50 representatives and policymakers from Ghana, Indonesia, Liberia, Nigeria, Seychelles, Somaliland, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Tunisia, Zanzibar, as well as experts on children's rights and representatives from civil society, including Gertrude Mongella and Auma Obama. Global Policy Action Plan The Global Policy Action Plan (GPACT) is a set of 22 interlinked, proven policy reforms that together, build sustainable, peaceful, and just societies and help to realise international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The \\"best\\" policies identified by the World Future Council are those that meet the seven Principles for Future-Just Law-Making. A coherent best policy guide that brings together working innovative policy solutions and forward-thinking practical tools. Implementation of Feed-in Tariff Laws Feed-In Tariff (FIT) laws to speed up renewable energy production have been introduced in several countries e.g. the UK, Australia, several US states, among them California, as well as in Ontario (Canada), with the support of the World Future Council. In establishing the Alliance for Renewable Energy, the World Future Council has created a coalition to spread renewable energies and contributed to the implementation of Feed-in Tariffs in the United States. Campaign for Ombudspersons for Future Generations The WFC has embarked on a Campaign for Ombudspersons for Future Generations on all governance levels. For the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, or 'Rio+20' in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012 the WFC was calling for the establishment of Ombudspersons for Future Generations, as a concrete solution under the second theme of the Summit 'Institutional Framework for Sustainable Development'. ==Councillors== The World Future Council (WFC) consists of 50 eminent global change-makers from governments, parliaments, civil societies, academia, the arts, and the business world.

The Digit Fund was created by Dr. Dian Fossey in 1978 for the sole purpose of financing her anti-poaching patrols and preventing further poaching of the mountain gorillas. Fossey studied at her Karisoke Research Center in the Virunga Volcanoes of Rwanda. The non-profit fund was named in memory of Fossey's favourite gorilla, Digit, who was decapitated by poachers for the offer of US$20 by a Hutu merchant who specialized in selling gorilla heads as trophies and gorilla hands as ashtrays to tourists. ==Background== Sometime during the day on New Year's Eve 1977, Fossey's favourite gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking antelope traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defense and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape. Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for an ashtray, for the price of $20. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant Ian Redmond, Fossey's group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned. Fossey subsequently created the Digit Fund to raise money for anti-poaching patrols.Fossey, Dian : Gorillas in the Mist. 1983 It was renamed as the \\"Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International\\" in 1992. Fossey mostly opposed the efforts of the international organizations, which she felt inefficiently directed their funds towards more equipment for Rwandan park officials, some of whom were alleged to have ordered some of the gorilla poachings in the first place. Digit's death had a profound effect on her approach to conservationism, and she commented that \\"I have tried not to allow myself to think of Digit's anguish, pain and the total comprehension he must have suffered in knowing what humans were doing to him. From that moment on, I came to live within an insulated part of myself.\\" ==Financing== Busy with her research in Africa, Fossey enlisted the help of her friends, primatologist Richard Wrangham and TV presenter David Attenborough, who approached conservation organizations located in the UK including the Fauna Preservation Society (FPS) and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which declined Fossey's request in favor of supporting an approach emphasizing tourism to Rwanda. At Wrangham's request, FPS launched an appeal in response to Digit's death, which the group subsequently named the Mountain Gorilla Fund for better name recognition; FPS chose to direct the funds to Rwandan park officials rather than Fossey's on- the-ground efforts. Fossey became frustrated as many international donors contributed funds in memory of Digit that were directed by international conservation organizations towards the construction of roads or the purchase of new vehicles for park conservation officials, who in many cases were bribed by poachers to look the other way from illegal activities and, according to Fossey, rarely ventured into the park at all. When payments for Fossey's articles on Digit's death were accidentally directed to the FPS Mountain Gorilla Fund rather than to her, FPS declined to redirect the money towards Fossey or her initiative. To coordinate donations to Rwandan authorities, FPS enlisted Fossey's former student and apprentice and one of her chief detractors, Sandy Harcourt. On her first trip to the United States after the poachings of Group 4, Fossey enlisted the aid of the National Geographic Society, which pledged $5,000, as did the World Wildlife Fund, over the objections of some of its members who had heard rumors of Fossey's anti- poaching patrols and other tactics she used against poaching. Fossey asked her friend Robinson McIlvaine, the head of the nonprofit African Wildlife Leadership Foundation, to serve as secretary-treasurer of the Digit Fund until she could find a salaried executive director to assume control over the operations. McIlvaine partnered with the International Primate Protection League, the Digit Fund, and his own African Wildlife Leadership Foundation asking for funds, to be made out to the AWLF. The Digit Fund received none of the money, and McIlvaine suggested to Fossey that the Digit Fund could be folded into AWLF, which Fossey declined; McIlvaine resigned as secretary- treasurer of the Digit Fund. Dr. Shirley McGreal, head of the IPPL, had allowed IPPL's co-sponsorship of the letter only to help the Digit Fund and blames the misunderstanding on Fossey being taken advantage of in the wake of her gorillas' deaths and never viewing the gorillas' deaths as a way for her to personally profit. McGreal volunteered to serve as secretary-treasurer in the wake of McIlvaine's resignation from the post. Through the seeming partnership of AWLF/Digit Fund, funds contributed to the Digit Fund by philanthropist Gordon Hanes and by students under the supervision of primatologist Geza Teleki came under the auspices of AWLF, not the Digit Fund. The US ambassador to Rwanda submitted a proposal in 1980 for Karisoke Research Center to be removed from Fossey's control and placed under a mountain gorilla consortium led by AWLF while Fossey was in America finishing her book. While she had lost control of funds raised in Britain after Digit's death to the Fauna Preservation Society, Fossey managed to keep the control of the Digit Fund in the United States until her death. After Fossey was murdered, the Digit Fund in the USA was renamed \\"The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International\\", and the Digit Fund in the UK was renamed the \\"Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund Europe\\" and later \\"The Gorilla Organization\\". ==Activities== Through the Digit Fund, Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps among the mountains of Virunga. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity. The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not catch any poachers' traps during the same period. The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International continues to operate the Karisoke Research Center, which Fossey founded in 1967, with daily gorilla monitoring and patrols. ==References== Category:Animal welfare organisations based in Rwanda Category:Nature conservation in Rwanda Category:Organizations established in 1978 Category:Gorillas Category:Poaching Category:Primate conservation ","title":"Digit Fund"},{"id":"5571273","text":"The Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) is a research and development centre functioning under Indian Space Research Organisation.LPSC Webpage It has two units located at Valiamala, in Thiruvananthapuram of Kerala, and Bengaluru of Karnataka.

She is a former Democratic U.S. Representative for . On November 4, 2008, Boyda was defeated for re-election by Kansas State Treasurer Lynn Jenkins, after serving one term. ==Early life, education, and career == Boyda graduated with honors from William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, where she received dual degrees in chemistry and education. She began her career in 1978 working as an analytical chemist and field inspector. Boyda grew up in a Republican family and later became a Democrat in 2003. ==U.S. House of Representatives== Elections ;2004 In 2004 she ran against Republican incumbent U.S. Congressman Jim Ryun in Kansas' Second District. Boyda criticized Ryun's support for school vouchers and his lack of support for public schools. She said she had left the Republican Party because it had become too conservative. Ryun criticized her for taking part in protests against the Iraq War. Boyda spent $1.1 million on her campaign, $300,000 of it her own money. Ryun spent $1.2 million. George W. Bush carried the district 59%-39% and Ryun defeated Boyda 56%-41%. She only won a single county: Crawford. ;2006 Boyda challenged Ryun again in 2006. The district was low on both national parties' political radars. Boyda was helped by the successful re-election bid of Governor Kathleen Sebelius, who won 57% to 40%. Ryun was a strongly conservative Republican and the Republican Party of Kansas had been rife with infighting between conservatives and moderates; moderate Republicans seem to have defected to both Sebelius and Boyda. There was also the issue of Ryun's purchase of a Washington, D.C. townhouse from Tom DeLay associates at a price well below market value. She defeated Ryun by 51% to 47%. ;2008 In January 2007, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Cole announced that the NRCC intended to target Boyda in 2008. Ryun announced that he would try to get his old seat back, and Republican leaders reportedly assured him that he would win. On April 4, 2007, State Treasurer Lynn Jenkins officially announced she would run in the Republican primary. She defeated State Senator Dennis Pyle in the primary. Boyda and Jenkins were opposed in the general election by Libertarian Party candidate Robert Garrard and Reform Party candidate Leslie Martin. Boyda announced that, unlike in 2006, she would not seek assistance from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for her 2008 campaign. She said that \\"Kansas voters should control Kansas campaigns\\" and that Kansans should be able to \\"run our election without Washington interference\\".

In April 2009, DCCC Chairman Chris Van Hollen said that Boyda left him a message saying that she regretted turning down the organisation's assistance and asked Van Hollen to play the message to any vulnerable Democrat who was considering turning down the committee's assistance. Van Hollen said that Boyda \\"has been very clear about the fact that she made a mistake... she clearly felt that not participating [with the DCCC's help] was a good part of the reason she failed.\\"https://swingstateproject.com/diary/4709/ks02-the-hard- way Tenure Nancy Boyda at a town hall meeting Boyda, as a freshman, introduced a bill, , to deny pensions to members of Congress convicted of bribery, conspiracy or perjury charges. The Bill passed in the House of Representatives on January 23, 2007, by a vote of 431‚Äì0. Boyda also applied to join the House Blue Dog Coalition, a caucus of conservative Democratic representatives. She was unable to join as adding her would have put the Blue Dogs over their membership limit of 47. On May 10, 2007, Boyda voted against , a measure, \\"to provide for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces and defense contractors from Iraq.\\" However, she continues to support gradual troop withdrawal while funding troops until they return. ;Environmental record Boyda supported research toward renewable forms of energy, particularly ethanol and biodiesel production that could benefit Kansas agriculture. ;Armed Services Committee hearing in July 2007 Congresswoman Boyda made news on July 27, 2007 by leaving a Congressional hearing while a retired Army general testified about US progress in Iraq. Retired Army General Jack Keane had testified that since the troop surge began, U.S. forces \\"are on the offensive and we have the momentum.\\" He also said security has improved in every neighborhood and district in and around Baghdad, and that \\"cafes, pool halls, coffee houses that I visited are full of people\\". Boyda said she left the House Armed Services Committee hearing during the testimony of General Keane because \\"there was only so much that you could take,\\" and continued to say she felt Keane's picture of the situation in Iraq was inappropriately \\"rosy.\\"Hananel, Sam. \\"Boyda defends decision to leave Iraq hearing\\".

Her Chief of Staff Shanan Guinn said, \\"She was frustrated with how the administration is handling the war, that no one wants to have a real conversation about ways to move forward and our brave men and women overseas are being played like a political ping pong ball.\\" Boyda later told the Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury, that she did not \\"walk out\\" of the meeting. Instead, she \\"stepped into a little room\\" adjacent to the meeting for five minutes, then returned.

She subsequently announced her candidacy to seek the Democratic nomination on July 1, 2019. During campaign stops she said finance practices and gerrymandering are big reasons why politicians don't \\"work across the aisle,\\" and she said her whole campaign is dedicated to breaking gridlock.

It was discovered on 5 October 1994, by German astronomer Freimut B√∂rngen at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in Tautenburg, eastern Germany. The asteroid was later named for German radio and TV host Hans Rosenthal. == Orbit and classification == Rosenthal is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,392 days; semi- major axis of 2.44 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 12¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery published by the Digitized Sky Survey. It was taken at the Siding Spring Observatory in September 1990, more than 4 years prior to its official discovery observation at Tautenburg. == Physical characteristics == Discovering Alfred-Jensch-telescope  Diameter estimate  Based on its absolute magnitude of 15.6, its diameter is between 2 and 5 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since asteroids in the inner main-belt are often of a brighter silicaceous ‚Äì rather than of a darker carbonaceous composition, with higher albedos, typically around 0.20, the asteroid's diameter might be on the lower end of NASA's published conversion table, as the lower the reflectivity (albedo), the larger the body's diameter for a given absolute magnitude. As of 2018, Rosenthal effective size, shape, pole, spectral type and composition, as well as its albedo and rotation period remain unknown. == Naming == This minor planet was named in honour of German radio and TV host Hans Rosenthal (1925‚Äì1987), a German Jew who survived the Holocaust as a boy inside Germany and became one of the country's most popular TV show masters ever in the early 1980s. He died of cancer at the age of 61.

During his time in the systems business, Belluzzo led both HP and SGI through the transition from proprietary systems to industry standard solutions. These actions were controversial at the time. In August 1999, Belluzzo left SGI to head Microsoft's MSN division, and then the whole Consumer business, leading several emerging efforts, including the launch of the first Xbox. In February 2001, he became president and chief operating officer of Microsoft, running the day-to-day business during the critical CEO transition from Bill Gates to Steve Ballmer. In September 2002, he was appointed CEO at Quantum Corp., where he managed the transformation from a Tape Drives to a Storage Systems Company, leader in Back-up, Recovery, and Archive solutions. In August 2015 he was appointed Interim CEO at Viavi Solutions, and led the completion of successful restructuring of JDSU into two public companies. After leaving Quantum, Belluzzo began working with Italian Startups in both the US and Italy, becoming an investor in several companies. In 2017 he became a partner at Venture Capital firm Innogest Capital. In 2017 he was awarded the honor of Cavaliere Della Repubblica Italiana (Italian Knighthood) by the President of the Italian Republic. ==References== Category:American chief executives of manufacturing companies Category:Living people Category:Hewlett-Packard people Category:Microsoft employees Category:Silicon Graphics people Category:1953 births Category:Golden Gate University alumni ","title":"Richard Belluzzo"},{"id":"5571386","text":"William Craig (May 16, 1828 - January 1, 1897) was an Ontario political figure.

The best-known and extensively documented refinement of the Unified Process is the Rational Unified Process (RUP). Other examples are OpenUP and Agile Unified Process. Profile of a typical project showing the relative sizes of the four phases of the Unified Process. == Overview == The Unified Process is not simply a process, but rather an extensible framework which should be customized for specific organizations or projects. The Rational Unified Process is, similarly, a customizable framework. As a result, it is often impossible to say whether a refinement of the process was derived from UP or from RUP, and so the names tend to be used interchangeably. The name Unified Process as opposed to Rational Unified Process is generally used to describe the generic process, including those elements which are common to most refinements. The Unified Process name is also used to avoid potential issues of trademark infringement since Rational Unified Process and RUP are trademarks of IBM. The first book to describe the process was titled The Unified Software Development Process () and published in 1999 by Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh. Since then various authors unaffiliated with Rational Software have published books and articles using the name Unified Process, whereas authors affiliated with Rational Software have favored the name Rational Unified Process. In 2012 the Disciplined Agile Delivery framework was released, a hybrid framework that adopts and extends strategies from Unified Process, Scrum, XP, and other methods. == Unified Process characteristics ==  Iterative and incremental  Diagram illustrating how the relative emphasis of different disciplines changes over the course of the project The Unified Process is an iterative and incremental development process. The Elaboration, Construction and Transition phases are divided into a series of timeboxed iterations. (The Inception phase may also be divided into iterations for a large project.) Each iteration results in an increment, which is a release of the system that contains added or improved functionality compared with the previous release. Although most iterations will include work in most of the process disciplines (e.g. Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing) the relative effort and emphasis will change over the course of the project.  Architecture-centric  The Unified Process insists that architecture sits at the heart of the project team's efforts to shape the system. Since no single model is sufficient to cover all aspects of a system, the Unified Process supports multiple architectural models and views. One of the most important deliverables of the process is the executable architecture baseline which is created during the Elaboration phase. This partial implementation of the system serves to validate the architecture and act as a foundation for remaining development.  Risk-focused  The Unified Process requires the project team to focus on addressing the most critical risks early in the project life cycle. The deliverables of each iteration, especially in the Elaboration phase, must be selected in order to ensure that the greatest risks are addressed first. == Project lifecycle (Phases of Unified Process) == The Unified Process divides the project into four phases: * Inception * Elaboration (milestone) * Construction (release) * Transition (final production release)  Inception phase  Inception is the smallest phase in the project, and ideally it should be quite short. If the Inception Phase is long then it may be an indication of excessive up-front specification, which is contrary to the spirit of the Unified Process. The following are typical goals for the Inception phase: * Establish * Prepare a preliminary project schedule and cost estimate * Feasibility * Buy or develop it The Lifecycle Objective Milestone marks the end of the Inception phase. Develop an approximate vision of the system, make the business case, define the scope, and produce rough estimate for cost and schedule.  Elaboration phase  During the Elaboration phase, the project team is expected to capture a healthy majority of the system requirements. However, the primary goals of Elaboration are to address known risk factors and to establish and validate the system architecture. Common processes undertaken in this phase include the creation of use case diagrams, conceptual diagrams (class diagrams with only basic notation) and package diagrams (architectural diagrams). The architecture is validated primarily through the implementation of an Executable Architecture Baseline. This is a partial implementation of the system which includes the core most architecturally significant components. It is built in a series of small time-boxed iterations. By the end of the Elaboration phase, the system architecture must have stabilized and the executable architecture baseline must demonstrate that the architecture will support the key system functionality and exhibit the right behavior in terms of performance, scalability, and cost. The final Elaboration phase deliverable is a plan (including cost and schedule estimates) for the Construction phase. At this point the plan should be accurate and credible since it should be based on the Elaboration phase experience and since significant risk factors should have been addressed during the Elaboration phase.  Construction phase  Construction is the largest phase of the project. In this phase, the remainder of the system is built on the foundation laid in Elaboration. System features are implemented in a series of short, time-boxed iterations. Each iteration results in an executable release of the software. It is customary to write full-text use cases during the construction phase and each one becomes the start of a new iteration. Common Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams used during this phase include activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, collaboration diagrams, State Transition diagrams and interaction overview diagrams. Iterative implementation for the lower risks and easier elements are done. The final Construction phase deliverable is software ready to be deployed in the Transition phase.  Transition phase  The final project phase is Transition. In this phase the system is deployed to the target users. Feedback received from an initial release (or initial releases) may result in further refinements to be incorporated over the course of several Transition phase iterations. The Transition phase also includes system conversions and user training. == Refinements and variations == Refinements of the Unified Process vary from each other in how they categorize the project disciplines or workflows. The Rational Unified Process defines nine disciplines: Business Modeling, Requirements, Analysis and Design, Implementation, Test, Deployment, Configuration and Change Management, Project Management, and Environment. The Enterprise Unified Process extends RUP through the addition of eight \\"enterprise\\" disciplines. Agile refinements of UP such as OpenUP/Basic and the Agile Unified Process simplify RUP by reducing the number of disciplines. Refinements also vary in the emphasis placed on different project artifacts. Agile refinements streamline RUP by simplifying workflows and reducing the number of expected artifacts. Refinements also vary in their specification of what happens after the Transition phase. In the Rational Unified Process the Transition phase is typically followed by a new Inception phase. In the Enterprise Unified Process the Transition phase is followed by a Production phase. The number of Unified Process refinements and variations are countless. Organizations utilizing the Unified Process invariably incorporate their own modifications and extensions. The following is a list of some of the better known refinements and variations. *Agile Unified Process (AUP), a lightweight variation developed by Scott W. Ambler *Basic Unified Process (BUP), a lightweight variation developed by IBM and a precursor to OpenUP *Enterprise Unified Process (EUP), an extension of the Rational Unified Process *Essential Unified Process (EssUP), a lightweight variation developed by Ivar Jacobson *Open Unified Process (OpenUP), the Eclipse Process Framework software development process *Rational Unified Process (RUP), the IBM / Rational Software development process *Oracle Unified Method (OUM), the Oracle development and implementation process * Rational Unified Process-System Engineering (RUP-SE), a version of RUP tailored by Rational Software for System Engineering ==References== * Kroll, Per; Kruchten, Philippe (2003).

He was Member of Parliament for Norwich South for 19 years in two non-consecutive terms, from 1974 to 1983, and later from 1987 to 1997. Garrett was born in Romford, the son of a book-keeper. He was brought up in Walthamstow, and attended the Monoux School. After National Service in the Royal Air Force he read geography at University College, Oxford, graduating with a first. He undertook research into industrial location, receiving a B.Litt, and spent a year at the University of California graduate business school as a King George VI Fellow. He worked in industry as a labour officer in the chemical industry, then a market research manager in the car industry, and finally a management consultant with Inbucon from 1963. He contributed to the Fulton Commission, on the reform of the civil service, from 1966 to 1968. He joined the Labour Party in 1951, and was elected to Greenwich Borough Council in 1970. He fought Norwich South in 1972, and unseated the Conservative Thomas Stuttaford, a local GP, at the February 1974 general election. He was re-elected in October 1974, and served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for the Civil Service, Robert Sheldon, in 1974, and to the Minister of State for Social Security, Stan Orme, from 1977‚Äì79. He was re-elected again in 1979, and became an opposition spokesman on Trade and Industry, but failed to gain a position in the shadow cabinet as a Tribune group candidate. With Robert Sheldon and Norman St John- Stevas, he was instrumental in the creation of the system of departmental Select committees. He and Sheldon collaborated in the establishment of the statutory independence of the National Audit Office. He lost his seat to the Conservative John Powley in the Conservative landslide at the 1983 election, and returned to work for Inbucon, but regained the seat at the next election, with a majority of only 336. He resumed his post as an opposition spokesman on Trade and Industry, then moved on to Energy, and finally to the Civil Service. He was re-elected in 1992, but retired due to ill health at the 1997 general election. His successor as MP for Norwich South was Charles Clarke, who later became Home Secretary. In retirement, he was a councillor for on Norfolk County Council from 1997 to 2001 and then on Norwich City Council, representing Bowthorpe.

Knyazhnin's contemporaries hailed him as the true successor to his father-in-law Alexander Sumarokov, but posterity, in the words of Vladimir Nabokov, tended to view his tragedies and comedies as \\"awkwardly imitated from more or less worthless French models\\".Eugene Onegin: A Novel in Verse: Commentary. Princeton University Press, 1991. . Page 82. ==Biography== Knyazhnin was born into the family of the vice-governor of Pskov. From 1750 he studied in the gymnasium at the Academy in St Petersburg. In 1755 he was a cadet of the Justice Board; and in 1757 translator at the Construction Office. In 1762 he was in military service as a secretary of Kirill Razumovsky. In 1770, he married Ekaterina Aleksandrovna Sumarokov. The couple had one of the most important literary salons in Russia. In 1773 he was sentenced to death for spending 6,000 roubles of fiscal money, however the sentence was reduced: he was deprived of the rank of officer and his nobility. In 1777 he obtained the forgiveness of the Empress Catherine II, and received back his nobility and officer rank. He was employed by Ivan Betskoy as his secretary. Soon he left into the resignation. He taught Russian Literature at the Military School. He was a member of Russian Academy from 1783. The son of Knyazhnin in a biographic essay about this father wrote that he died of \\"catarrhal fever\\". This seems to be more accurate than another version, propagated by Pushkin, which claims that Knyazhnin died from torture at the hands of the secret police. ==Legacy== Knyazhnin's contemporary success rested largely on his witty comedies The Braggart (1786) and The Cranks (1790). The latter revolves around the theme of favouritism, of the unexpectedly quick rise in rank, which was topical in Catherine's reign, and considered risqu√©.Robert Leach, Victor Borovsky. A History of Russian Theatre. Cambridge University Press, 1999. . Page 70. He also wrote six comic operas operas and eight tragedies, which, as D.S. Mirsky put it, \\"breathe an almost revolutionary spirit of political freethinking\\".D.S. Mirsky. A History of Russian Literature. Northwestern University Press, 1999. . Page 54. Almost everything he wrote was immediately published by the decree of Catherine the Great. Most of his plays and operas were staged at the Hermitage Theatre in St Petersburg. Among his other works are poems and translations including works by Voltaire and Corneille. Writing his plays and opera librettos, Knyaznin often borrowed some ideas from Voltaire, Metastasio, Moli√®re and Carlo Goldoni developing them and putting in different context. He imitated these models so extensively that Alexander Pushkin later referred to him as \\"Knyazhnin the Borrower\\" (or \\"derivative Knyazhnin\\" ‚Äî ¬´–ø–µ—Ä–µ–∏–º—á–∏–≤—ã–π –ö–Ω—è–∂–Ω–∏–Ω¬ª, see details). Knyazhnin's last tragedy, Vadim of Novgorod (1789), was inspired by Catherine II's treatment of Vadim's revolt against Rurik in her own play From Ryurik's Life. Disputing with her, Knyazhnin depicted Vadim as a champion of Novgorod's ancient liberties who has to stab himself in the face of triumphant authoritorianism. When the play was posthumously published in 1793, the Empress had it banned as a \\"literary revolt\\". Against the background of the French Revolution, it was decided wise to burn all the copies.

He is best known for his sophisticated puns and surreal humour. == Early life == Devos was born in Mouscron, Belgium, close to the French border. Both his parents were French and he moved to Tourcoing, France, at the age of two. Seven years later, his family moved to Paris. During the Second World War he was sent, like many young men of his generation, to Germany to work. On his return to France, he took acting and mime lessons at the √âtienne Ducroux school, where he met Marcel Marceau. In 1948, he was part of a burlesque trio (in the older sense of the word burlesque). == Career == Devos's career took off in the 1950s when he began writing his own one man shows and was the opening act for Maurice Chevalier. Although his act still involved elements of his early years as a clown (such as juggling) he was mostly recognized because of his mastery of the French language. His unique brand of surreal humour and sophisticated puns garnered him much respect throughout the Francophone world. Devos is a leading character in Alejandro Jodorowsky's surrealist 1957 debut short film Les t√™tes interverties (a mime adaptation of Thomas Mann's 1940 play The Transposed Heads).

Coal mining was established in the area in 1862 with the development of a railway station. . In 1864 keroscene shale was discovered.. By the 1870s, Greta had four hotels , four churches ,a school and schools of arts..Geologist Edgeworth David discovered coal seam in 1886. By 1907 ten collieries were in operation. In 1939 an army training camp was established. After WWII the town's population grew as it became a migrant camp for European refugees. The small town has a large European community with many people coming from, Polish, Ukrainian and German heritage. At the 2016 census the town had a population of 2,830. The Main Street of Greta, High street is a quiet stretch of road with the most popular social areas being Tattersalls Hotel Pub (more commonly known as 'Tatts' or 'Greta Pub') and the bowling club.

The town is also linked to nearby town, Branxton where you will find the nearest grocery store. Being in the Hunter Valley, Greta is close to many vineyards and wine cellars. == Greta Army Camp == The Greta Army Camp, located on the town's outskirts, was opened in 1939 as a training ground for World War II soldier training, and in 1949 was transferred to the Department of Immigration who transformed it into one of Australia's largest migrant reception and training centres between June 1949 and January 1960 as part of the post-war immigration to Australia. Over 100,000 new migrants seeking a new life in Australia passed through Greta Camp throughout its 11-years in operation. == Sport == Greta is heavily associated with Branxton, which is only to the northwest, with many combined sporting ventures, the most notable being \\"The Greta-Branxton Wildcats\\" soccer and \\"Greta-Branxton Colts\\" rugby league clubs. == Tidy Towns == Greta's Tidy Towns projects have also been nationally recognised and even achieved multiple awards and prestige for its beautification of what was once considered an unfashionable place to live. Greta Tidy Towns Committee meets regularly to discuss changes to the town and to manage its continuing beautification. == Transport == Greta is located on the New England Highway, approximately north of Sydney. Access to Sydney will be possible via the Hunter Expressway when it is completed. NSW TrainLink's Hunter Line passes through Greta railway station, which opened in 1869. ==Heritage listings== Greta has a number of heritage-listed sites, such as the Greta railway station. == Images of Greta == File:Greta-Cenotaph.jpgGreta War Memorial Cenotaph File:Army Camp Shelter anzac 2004.jpgGreta Rest area shelter File:Welcome to Greta Sign.jpgThe welcoming sign to Greta's Hunter River Catchment File:Childrens Litter PRevention Sign.jpg A Child's litter prevention sign.

Known for his literal \\"translations\\" and parodies of popular Filipino and foreign songs, Michael V. has also made original songs, such as \\"Sinaktan Mo ang Puso Ko\\" (\\"You Hurt My Heart\\") and \\"Hindi Ako Bakla\\" (\\"I'm Not Gay\\"). The song \\"Sinaktan Mo ang Puso Ko\\" is closely similar to Weird Al Yankovic's \\"You Don't Love Me Anymore\\". He also has a YouTube channel named Michael V. #BitoyStory, which has reached more than 720,000 subscribers as of June 2020. ==Early life== Michael V. was born on December 17, 1969 at Clinica dela Rosa in Malate, Manila to Cesar Felix Bunagan and Melba Balonzo del Valle. His father named him after German composer Ludwig van Beethoven, upon seeing a copy of Beethoven's LP in his boss' office, not knowing that \\"Beethoven\\" is a surname. The nickname \\"Bitoy\\" was taken from a kiddie TV character played by comedian Bentot. When Bentot, as Bitoy, guested in Iskul Bukol, then-high school student Beethoven saw it and began mimicking Bentot's voice in school. His classmates then called him \\"Bitoy\\", to which the nickname stuck to this day. He finished his secondary education in Manila Science High School. Bunagan later earned a degree in mass communications from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. He joined a lot of contests on TV. In one contest in Eat Bulaga!, judge Ogie Alcasid turned him down. Later, Beethoven became a co-host of Eat Bulaga! and Ogie Alcasid became one of his close friends and co-star in the long-running Bubble Gang and Tropang Trumpo. During the popularity of Andrew E., the song \\"Humanap Ka ng Panget\\" became wildly popular, to which the then unsigned Beethoven composed a reply song entitled \\"Maganda Ang Piliin (Ayoko Ng Panget)\\". At that time, OctoArts was then inviting Beethoven's female friend and rapping partner, Dianne, to submit a demo tape. In that demo tape, Beethoven's \\"Maganda Ang Piliin\\" was accidentally included. He and Dianne got individual recording contracts. Beethoven's song and its accompanying album became a hit. When he entered show business, he and his manager were deciding a stage name for his career as a rapper. Back then, the most popular Filipino rappers were Andrew E. and Francis Magalona so they opted for a similar stage name: \\"Michael V.\\", after Michael Jackson and Gary V., Bunagan's favorite international and local artists respectively. Michael V.'s first feature film appearance was in Regal Films' comedy film, \\"Banana Split\\" topbilled by Joey Marquez. He eventually gained prominence when OctoArts Films started to include him in several comedies alongside Vic Sotto (\\"Ano ba Yan\\", \\"Ano ba Yan 2\\", \\"D' Sisters\\", \\"Lastikman\\"), Ogie Alcasid (\\"Ano ba Yan\\", \\"Ano ba Yan 2\\", \\"Manolo en Michelle\\", etc.), Francis Magalona, among others. ==Television and film career== He has won the Asian Television Awards for Best Comedy Performance by an Actor for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. He recently joined MariMar as the voice of the eponymous character's pet dog Fulgoso. After his voice-acting in MariMar, he played a supporting role in Codename: Asero. On August 23, 2008, Michael V, after winning Best Comedy Performance Award at the Asian Television Awards for three consecutive years‚Äîwas officially informed that he will grace the front cover of Reader's Digest (RD) 5th Annual Humor Special, September issue. Making him the second Filipino whoever landed on the covers of Readers Digest next to former President Cory Aquino.gmanews.tv/story, Michael V graces Reader's Digest cover for September issue, gmanews.tv; accessed 4 November 2015. He also recently had a comedy movie with longtime friend Ogie Alcasid called Ang Spoiled Brat: The Movie produced by GMA Films and APT Productions, inspired from a segment of GMA 7's award-winning gag-show, Bubble Gang. Bitoy also hosted a game show on GMA, Hole in the Wall with Ogie Alcasid in 2009. Bitoy formerly hosted a comedy-talent show called Bitoy's SHOwwwTIME, which aired from 2009‚Äì10 and also hosted Kap's Amazing Stories: Kids Edition, while original host Bong Revilla had left the show shortly for re-election as senator, but Revilla won again as Senator a week later. Bitoy also won as a Celebrity Inductee to the Eastwood City Walk Of Fame Philippines in 2009. Bitoy had his first sitcom entitled Pepito Manaloto currently airing on GMA 7 and is also formerly co-hosting the long running variety game show, Eat Bulaga! from 2003 to early 2016. In 2010, Bitoy became Nestle Philippines' Laki sa Gatas advocate for Bear Brand Milk. In 2010, Bitoy returned to drama via Jillian Namamasko Po! which he plays a Santa Claus which he created a doll and gives to a good little child. In 2011, Bitoy appeared in Bantatay which he returns to voice as a dog. it was his 4th GMA 7 Telebabad after Marimar and Codename: Asero and Jillian Namamasko Po!.

In 2019, Bitoy planned to return and make his directorial debut film Family History via GMA Pictures (formerly GMA Films). ==Personal life== Bitoy and his wife Carol have 4 children. In August 2013, Michael was hospitalized for dengue fever, according to a tweet from Ogie Alcasid. Both Alcasid and Michael solicited prayers and platelet donations over the following days, promising to update fans once the situation gets better. Michael then later tweeted that he was recovering from his previous condition, thanking his fans for support. On July 20, 2020, Michael V. announced in a vlog that he had tested positive for COVID-19. On August 11, Michael V. announced in another vlog that he had already recovered. ==Music career== Discography Michael V. started his showbiz career as a rapper. In 1991 he released his first single \\"Maganda ang Piliin\\" (Choose Someone Beautiful), an answer to the wildly popular hit \\"Humanap Ka ng Panget\\" (Find Someone Ugly) sung by Andrew E. The song gained heavy radio airplay and he went on to release two more albums as a rapper in 1992 and 1994. In 1997, he released a parody album entitled \\"MTB: Miyusik Tagalog Bersiyon\\" which contained literal translations of pop music hits from the '80s and '90s. But what made the album a big success was the original single \\"Sinaktan Mo ang Puso Ko\\" (You Hurt My Heart). Written by Michael V. himself, the humorous love song gained commercial success and became the \\"unofficial anthem\\" for the heartbroken, despite its violently funny lyrics. In 1998, Bitoy released the sequel parody album \\"MTB: Miyusik Tagalog Bersiyon 2\\" where he released more original songs than the first album. In 1999, he unleashed \\"MEV: Miyusik English Version\\" where he literally translated hit OPM classics into English while his original compositions (led by the hit single \\"Mas Mahal na Kita Ngayon\\") were in Filipino. In 2006, Michael released his studio album, The Bubble G Anthology, which is a compilation of his song parodies from the TV show Bubble Gang under GMA Records. Anthology was described as \\"an audio-visual venture\\", with songs such as Mamaw, a parody of Kamikazee's song Narda, and DJ Bumbay, a comical take at the Indian merchants that are doing business in the Philippines. Some the songs in his album, like Wag N'yo Kaming Pansinin, poked fun at his gay colleague, Diego, and Myka, a black woman who is also a regular at Bubble Gang. The album was also released partly due to bootleg recordings of his songs which came in mono and had laugh tracks interspersed throughout them, owing to being ripped from existing Bubble Gang episodes. Albums * Maganda Ang Piliin (1991) * Joke Time (1991) * Gusto Kong Sumigaw! (1994) * MTB: Myusik Tagalog Bersiyon (1997) * MEB: Myusik English Bersiyon (1997) * Miyusik Tagalog Bersiyon 2 (1998) * The Bubble G Anthology (2006) As composer Aside from his new album, he is a composer of theme songs not only for his show Bubble Gang but also in other GMA shows. One notable song he composed is \\"Alinlangan\\", sung by Jolina Magdangal for the GMA fantasy serial Super Twins. He is also notable for creating some parody songs, including \\"Sabog Sabog Tayo\\", which was released on February 20, 2009. He also composed \\"Tim Song Ku\\" sung by Regine Velasquez for the 14th Anniversary of longest-running comedy show, Bubble Gang. ==Filmography== Television {  - ccc; text-align:center;\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background: LightSteelBlue;\\"  Television - ccc; text-align:center;\\"  Year  Title  Role  Network -  2019  Eat Bulaga!

The game allows the player to equip their warrior with katanas, spears, and other weapons. ==Characters== The samurai is Onimaru, who is supported by a wide range of characters, many of whom are the same as their PlayStation 2 equivalents. However, there are some returning characters from other Onimusha games such as Saika Magoichi, Ankokuji Ekei, F≈´ma Kotar≈ç, and Akechi Mitsuhide.

From a humble beginning he became Hunterian Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in the College of Surgeons of England. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865, awarded the Royal Medal in 1866. From 1871‚Äì73 he was President of the Royal Microscopical Society, and in 1885 he received the Baly Medal of the Royal College of Physicians. == Life == Parker was born in the village of Dogsthorpe, near Peterborough in the County of Northamptonshire. Dogsthorpe was part of the Soke of Peterborough, which is now in Cambridgeshire. His father, Thomas Parker, was a working farmer, living in a thatched house, built in 1635. Thomas was a Wesleyan of the old school: a Methodist-Churchman, God-fearing and courteous, farming his own land. He married the daughter of another farmer, Sarah Kitchen, whose name was also given to their son William. William Parker was the second son, and six other children in the family died in their infancy.Parker T. Jeffery 1893. William Kitchen Parker FRS. Macmillan, London. p7 He went to a village dame school early in life, then to parish schools in Werrington and Paston. Schooling was interspersed with farm-work. After telling his father that farm-work was not for him, Parker entered the Peterborough Grammar Schoolthere is no school with this name at present for nine months, and then started on the road to medical education. He was articled to a surgeon at Market Overton in 1842, using his spare time to teach himself about the plants of the neighbourhood. His knowledge of botany became remarkably extensive and accurate. In 1842 he became apprenticed to a country surgeon. During this time he continued educating himself in natural history by reading, looking and doing. The doing consisted of collecting and dissecting birds and mammals, and working up a portfolio of exquisitely beautiful and accurate drawings. Parker married Elizabeth Jeffery whilst still a student: she was the daughter of the clerk to the Vauxhall Bridge Company. Her mother was the sister of Joseph Prendergast DD (1791‚Äì1875), the Headmaster of Colfe's School (1831‚Äì1857), and the benefactor of Prendergast School, both in the borough of Lewisham. William and Elizabeth had seven children, three daughters and four sons. The first son, Thomas Jeffery Parker, became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in the University of Otago, New Zealand; the second, William Newton Parker, became Professor of Biology in the University College, Cardiff; the third was a draughtsman and lithographer; the fourth was a surgeon. In his work on the vertebrate skull Parker became close to Thomas Henry Huxley, and named one of his sons after him. His first son was sent to study under Huxley, and became in 1872 one of Huxley's demonstrators.Parker, Thomas Jeffery ‚Äì Biography ‚Äì Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand Parker was elected FRS in 1865, and a few years afterwards the Royal Society gave him an annual grant to aid his work, and a generous Wesleyan friend more than once presented ¬£100 towards the cost of publishing some of his plates. Later in life a State pension was awarded. The honours and appointments Parker gained later in life were due mainly for his work on the vertebrate skeleton and its significance in establishing a \\"true theory of the vertebrate skull\\" (Edward Sabine). His Royal Society obituary notice described him as \\"An unworldly seeker after truth, loved by all who knew him\\".Jones T. Rupert and Harting J.E. 1900. William Kitchen Parker. Proc Roy Soc 48 xv‚Äìxx. He is buried in a Wandsworth cemetery under a cross of red granite. == Medical training == Parker studied at King's College London from 1844‚Äì46, and became a student-demonstrator there to Mr (later Sir) William Bowman, the surgeon, histologist and anatomist. He attended Charing Cross Hospital in 1846‚Äì47.Anon. 1890. A memoir of William Kitchen Parker FRS. Nature 24 July, 42, 297‚Äì299. He never took notes during lectures, but drew sketches, and claimed he remembered the facts as well as anyone who took notes.Parker T.J. William Kitchen Parker FRS. p19 He produced sheet after sheet of artistic drawing, all worthy of publication and large numbers of skeletons of birds and mammals. He attended Richard Owen's lectures at the College of Surgeons, and \\"received with enthusiasm the doctrine of the archetype which he was afterwards to do so much to overturn\\".Parker T.J. William Kitchen Parker FRS. p24. Parker avoided taking exams, and remained for many years with the minimum qualification for running a general medical practice, which in those days was an LSA (Licenciate of the Society of Apothecaries), a qualification of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries.Society of Apothecaries From 1849, Parker ran a general practice in London for many years, at various locations. The income supported his family, but his interest was in zoology, at which he was entirely self-taught. Today he is remembered only as a zoologist, one of a quite a sizeable groupincluding Thomas Henry Huxley, Richard Owen and Joseph Dalton Hookerwho were qualified in medicine but whose life work was in natural history or one of the newly named biological sciences. == Career in zoology ==  Forams  Introduced to the microscope during his medical studies, Parker continued to study the microscopic structure of tissues. It was on a visit to Bognor collecting sand that he encountered Polyzoa and Foraminifera, which he sorted, mounted and studied. Parker became one of the greatest authorities on the Foraminifera, a group containing microscopic single-celled amoeboid protists with calcareous tests (shells). Had he not met Rupert Jones and Crawford Williamson he might have remained an unpublished amateur. It was Jones, mainly, who taught him how to present his considerable knowledge, and together they wrote 34 papers on the forams.Parker W.K. and T. Rupert Jones 1865.

The Ray Society, London.  Morphology of birds  At the same time, Parker worked on his dissections, preparations and skeletons of vertebrates, especially birds. He developed, for example, about 300 preparations of bird wings and many complete skeletons. This work resulted in 24 papers on birds, including one on Archaeopteryx. There is a general article on birds in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 9th ed.Parker W.K. 1862. On the osteology of Balaeniceps rex, Gould (1860). Proc Zool Soc 4, 269‚Äì351, 3 plates.Parker W.K. 1866.

Owen's concept of vertebrate anatomy  Richard Owen was one of Parker's teachers, yet Parker came to overthrow the master's ideas. Owen's view on anatomy did not derive from evolution, but from German philosophical notions of idealism. These ideas, associated in biology with Goethe and Kant, and developed in anatomy by Oken and Cuvier, were used by Owen in his theoretical expositions. Vertebrate anatomy, in this scheme, was to be seen as variations on an archetype.Desmond A. 1982. Archetypes and ancestors: palaeontology in Victorian London 1850‚Äì1875. Muller, London. From an idea of Goethe's in 1790, Oken developed a theory that the bones of the skull were four modified vertebrae. Oken's exaggeration \\"The entire man is only a vertebra\\" was memorable.Oken L. 1807. Inaugural dissertation, Jena. Oken's ideas were revived and expanded by Owen, and presented to the British Association meeting in 1846.Owen R. 1846. Report on the archetype and homologies of the vertebrate skeleton. British Association. The weak point in Owen's theory was its basis solely on the more derived and specialised skulls, and even so it took no notice of their embryological development. For example, Owen made no reference to the work of Rathke, who had shown in 1839 that there was no sign of the four vertebrae in the early embryo of snakes.  The assault on Owen's system  Huxley was the first man to attack Owen's ideas on the vertebrate skeleton, in his Croonian Lecture to the Royal Society in 1858. He showed from a study of the early stages of lower fish, and also the stickleback and the frog, that the segmentation of the skull in higher vertebrata is a secondary process, and is independent of vertebration. The basis of the work was embryology, but the early history of the skull was known in only a few species. Parker's distinction was to carry out a careful study of the process in a much wider variety of vertebrates; his ironic comment on the \\"anatomical suffering caused to fish from their being dragged into harmony with that mischievous piece of work, the vertebrate archetype\\" shows, from such a gentle man, a surprising vigour in debate. \\"It is high time for us to have ceased from transcendentalism: of what use is it?\\" he asked.Parker W.K. 1864, On the sternal apparatus of birds and other vertebrates. Proc Zool Soc 339‚Äì341.  Parker on the vertebrate skull  From 1865 to 1888 Parker published 36 studies on the vertebrate skull, including a monograph .Parker W.T. and Bettany G.T. 1872. The morphology of the skull. London. The entire series comprises nearly 1800 pages of letterpress and about 270 plates. The work was summarised in Francis Balfour's Comparative Embryology of 1881, and settled the fate of Owen's transcendental archetype theory of the vertebrate skull once and for all.  The vertebrate shoulder-girdle  Another major vertebrate project was a monograph on the comparative anatomy of the vertebrate shoulder-girdle (pectoral girdle).Parker W.K. 1868. A monograph on the structure and development of the shoulder-girdle and sternum in the vertebrates. Ray Society, London, p237 + 30 tinted plates. The plates were drawn, variously, by Parker and George West, and West was the lithographer. Text diagrams are unsigned, but probably by the same, or by Parker alone. One of the chief results of this work was, by demonstrating the true homologies of the various bones of the shoulder-girdle in fishes, to overthrow Owen's theory of the nature of limbs. Parker showed (contrary to Owen) that the true shoulder-girdle is from the first totally independent of the skull. In teleost and ganoid fish, the skull and shoulder-girdle are brought into connexion by derivatives of the skin-skeleton, not by bones of the shoulder-girdle. Discoveries like this alerted Parker to the failure of the great system of transcendental anatomy which Owen had done so much to establish.Parker T.J. William Kitchen Parker FRS. p40 & following.  Royal College of Surgeons  In 1873, Professor Flower was invalided, and Parker was asked to step in the breach. He took his MRCS diploma by viva voce, and was appointed Professor. Afterwards, they shared the Hunterian chair jointly.  Difficulty in writing  There are many indications that Parker found writing difficult, and avoided it, and when forced to write the result was often scarcely comprehensible. Whatever the reason, he needed, and got, help and advice. Huxley gave him detailed advice more than once, which Parker either ignored or could not put into action. :\\"He wrote without system, putting down everything as it occurred to him, and continually going off on side issues. He never revised: it was always the first draft of his MS. that went to the printer, and none but minor alterations were made in proof; and such methods of assisting the reader as abstracts, careful descriptions of figures, etc., always seemed to him superfluous.\\" Parker T.J. William Kitchen Parker FRS. p61 :\\"But from the purely literary standpoint the case is altered: scattered up and down his writings are passages of great beauty, of true and sincere eloquence, and of quaint whimsical humour.\\" Parker T.J. William Kitchen Parker FRS. p68 Although Parker could scarcely write a simple descriptive sentence to save his life, he certainly had a huge grasp of the imagery and poetics of the English language. This is part of one sequence quoted by his son: :\\"If the Megatherium, or his somewhat more modest-sized relation, the Mylodon (another extinct sloth), did find their supply of food in the way palaeontologists suggest, their mode of dining must have been a sight worth seeing... :\\"Let us, however, try to imagine a Megatherium waking up after lazily dozing a month or two during the dry season, and then, hungry and wet, in the heavy downpour of the beginning rainy season, setting to work to break his fast. As far as can be judged by the tools he had to work with‚Äîpaws a yard, and claws a foot, in length‚Äîthe first thing to be done was to throw a few hundredweights of earth from the roots of some large tree. :\\"Now he changes his tactics; he has good collar-bones, and well-shaped arms for embracing; so, bear-like, he hugs the tree upon which his desires are set, and, busily digging still, not now with his fore, but with his hind, paws, his great weight resting upon his haunches and his tail, he, with many groans, sways the big tree to and fro; at last with a great crash it falls...\\"Parker T.J. William Kitchen Parker FRS. p71‚Äì73 That is certainly not the prose of the usual science author. At least two of Parker's books were written with help: his Morphology of the skull was written from his dictation and notes by G.T. Bettany, and his 1884 lectures On mammalian descent were written with the help of a friend, Arabella Buckley, who had been Charles Lyell's secretary. Parker's avoidance of exams also points towards an avoidance of writing, especially since his early career would have been much improved by taking a higher qualification. As far as we know, it was not a lack of money which prevented him taking exams (as it was with Huxley). His father, though not wealthy, was able to give his children a start in life. Dyslexia is a possible explanation, but it is hard to reconcile with passages such as the above. Perhaps an upbringing in a farmhouse with little reading material apart from the Bible, and little opportunity to practice writing in his early years led to his unusual characteristics as a scientific writer. == References  External links == *On Mammalian Descent; the Hunterian Lectures for 1884: being nine lectures ...

RV Tauri variables are also often considered to lie on the instability strip, occupying the area to the right of the brighter Cepheids (at lower temperatures), since their pulsations are attributed to the same mechanism. == Position on the HR diagram == This HR plot shows 22,000 stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue and 1,000 low-luminosity stars (red and white dwarfs) from the Gliese Catalogue. The Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram plots the real luminosity of stars against their effective temperature (their color, given by the temperature of their photosphere). The instability strip intersects the main sequence, (the prominent diagonal band that runs from the upper left to the lower right) in the region of A and F stars (1‚Äì2 solar mass ()) and extends to G and early K bright supergiants (early M if RV Tauri stars at minimum are included). Above the main sequence, the vast majority of stars in the instability strip are variable. Where the instability strip intersects the main sequence, the vast majority of stars are stable, but there are some variables, including the roAp stars. ==Pulsations== Stars in the instability strip pulsate due to He III (doubly ionized helium). In normal A-F-G stars He is neutral in the stellar photosphere. Deeper below the photosphere, at about 25,000‚Äì30,000K, begins the He II layer (first He ionization). Second ionization (He III) starts at about 35,000‚Äì50,000K. When the star contracts, the density and temperature of the He II layer increases. He II starts to transform into He III (second ionization). This causes the opacity of the star to increase and the energy flux from the interior of the star is effectively absorbed. The temperature of the star rises and it begins to expand. After expansion, He III begins to recombine into He II and the opacity of the star drops. This lowers the surface temperature of the star. The outer layers contract and the cycle starts from the beginning. The phase shift between a star's radial pulsations and brightness variations depends on the distance of He II zone from the stellar surface in the stellar atmosphere. For most Cepheids, this creates a distinctly asymmetrical observed light curve, rising rapidly to maximum and falling slowly back down to minimum. ==Other pulsating stars== There are several types of pulsating star not found on the instability strip and with pulsations driven by different mechanisms. At cooler temperatures are the long period variable AGB stars. At hotter temperatures are the Beta Cephei and PV Telescopii, variables. Right at the edge of the instability strip near the main sequence are Gamma Doradus variables. The band of White dwarfs has three separate regions types of variable: DOV, DBV, and DAV (= ZZ Ceti variables) white dwarfs. Each of these types of pulsating variable has an associated instability strip created by variable opacity partial ionisation regions other than helium. Most high luminosity supergiants are somewhat variable, including the Alpha Cygni variables. In the specific region of more luminous stars above the instability strip are found the yellow hypergiants which have irregular pulsations and eruptions. The hotter luminous blue variables may be related and show similar short- and long-term spectral and brightness variations with irregular eruptions. ==References== Category:Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell classifications Category:Stellar evolution ","title":"Instability strip"},{"id":"5571494","text":"Palau Municipal d'Esports de Badalona (also known as the Pavell√≥ Ol√≠mpic de Badalona) is an arena in the Gorg area of Badalona, Catalonia, Spain.

NCESS pursues problems related to land, sea and atmosphere. It was instituted by the government of Kerala in 1978, at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. CESS was the earliest institute in the country to embrace the concept of Earth System Science (ESS). CESS contributions over the years have enhanced knowledge of the geological evolution of south India, the complexity of coastal processes and natural hazards, as well as in proposing mitigatory measures to deal with natural hazards. CESS carries out studies in river basin evaluation, ground water management, coastal erosion, and other special problems. CESS does research in earth system, micro-level watershed planning, natural hazards management, chemical analysis, CRZ mapping, and studies of air, water, land, noise pollution, etc. CESS also does environmental impact assessment, coastal and estuarine management, terrain analysis, natural resources management, laser applications, river sand mining, and microlevel planning. CESS conducts research courses leading to doctoral degree. Recognizing the growth potential of CESS, resource constraints of the State Government and the role CESS can play in national development, the government of Kerala proposed the taking over of the institute by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. An expert committee made an assessment of the scientific programs pursued by the institute and deliberated on a long term vision for the institute as a national centre. The committee recommended the taking over of CESS by the MoES and according it the status of an autonomous institute under the Earth System Science Organization (ESSO) of MoES. The proposed thrust areas of research will be crustal evolution and geodynamics, sedimentology and depositional processes, coastal dynamics and cloud microphysics. The total estimated budget requirements of CESS will be Rs.128.67 crore for the balance period of the 12th FYP. == Campus == The Centre for Earth Science Studies is housed in a 50,000 sq. ft building constructed in a campus of 19 acres. The development of the CESS campus in 1986 saw the transformation of an abandoned clay mining site to a beautiful green campus within one year. The campus was the vision of the founder Director Prof. C. Karunakaran, realised through the leadership of Dr. H. K. Gupta, the then director and Sri M. Sethumadhavan, the then registrar, and Dr S. Satheeschandran Nair. The CESS building is constructed on natural gradients, slopes and excavated mining areas in a nature friendly architectural design. Buildings are spread as different blocks. Main building houses Administration, Library, Conference Hall and an auditorium. Four interconnected blocks provide seating spaces for scientists. Laboratory block houses main laboratories of all divisions with a centralised access to scientists of all disciplines.

It was discovered by Canadian amateur astronomer Andrew Lowe on 17 August 2002, from digitized photographic plates taken at the Palomar Observatory. It was named for the University of Alberta. == Orbit and classification == Uofalberta is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population, located just inside the region of the Cybele asteroids (3.3‚Äì3.7 AU). It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9‚Äì3.5 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,103 days; semi-major axis of 3.21 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 12¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's first observation was found on images taken by the Siding Spring Observatory in November 1997, and were published by the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) later on. The asteroid's observation arc begins with a precovery in February 1999, when it was observed at the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking at Haleakala Observatory. == Naming == This minor planet was named after the University of Alberta; the initials of its motto Quaecumque Vera (\\"Whatsoever things are true\\") appear in the provisional designation. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 September 2005 (). == Physical characteristics == According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer, Uofalberta measures 6.834 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.055. Due to its low albedo and location far out the asteroid belt, Uofalberta is likely a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Uofalberta has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown. == References  External links == * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (95001)-(100000) ‚Äì Minor Planet Center * * 099906 Category:Discoveries by Andrew Lowe Category:Named minor planets 20020817 ","title":"99906 Uofalberta"},{"id":"5571535","text":"John Howard is considered the central pioneer of adventure racing. Very few individuals have dominated endurance sports in the way John dominated adventure racing. Since winning the first ever major adventure race held in the world, the Raid Gauloises in 1989, he went on to win every significant race in the sport, including Eco-Challenge (three times), the Raid Gauloises (three times), the Elf Authentique, the ESPN X-Games (twice) and the Southern Traverse. In addition, he has served as a course designer or advisor to numerous high-profile outdoor adventure events, including the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest, Action Asia and New Zealand's (which he won in 1984). In discussing his win of the Coast to Coast in 1984 Howard claims that were only about 50 competitors at the time. These were very different competitors than the present day, describing them as \\"outdoors people\\" rather than those who do sports specific training. In 1984, Howard lived in Christchurch, New Zealand (his home country), and worked as a window cleaner. He is perceived as somewhat of an enigma in the sport. At the Raids Gauloises in Borneo in 1994, he revolutionised the way teams approached adventure races such as the Eco- Challenge and Raid Gauloises by taking the bare minimum of equipment, including food and water, between checkpoints, and wearing shorts, a T-shirt and running shoes, and carrying a microscopic backpack. Previously competitors had competed in hiking and mountaineering gear and carried heavy bags throughout the event. This gave Howard and his team a huge advantage and they blitzed the course, winning an expected eight-day race in five. His advantage was only temporary; from 1995, everybody was racing in a similar, stripped- down fashion. Ian Adamson, considered by many the Michael Jordan of the sport, describes Howard as, \\"... a unique individual. He cultivates a disheveled look to maintain his individuality and to match his already eccentric persona. On a personal level he is extremely caring and generous, and I would (and have) placed my life in his hands. John looks like a mountain man because he is. He has an immensely deep background in all back country skills since this is the life he has led since he was a teenager. He has also been winning adventure races longer than most athletes have been around. Finally, he races exclusively with people he likes, respects and who he knows he can win with.\\" On 20 August 2005, Primal Quest announced that John Howard was joining the world's premier adventure race as Technical Director. ==References External links == * Interview with John Howard Polish AR site Napieraj.pl Category:Living people Category:Adventure racing Category:Sportspeople from Christchurch Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"John Howard (adventure racer)"},{"id":"5571537","text":"Nadal (, , ) is a surname of Catalan, Occitan, and VenetianGens Labo Net, surnames in Italy Cognomix, surnames in Italy origin.

The subject of Windy Gully is the mine disaster which took place at Mount Kembla on 31 July 1902, in which 96 men and boys lost their lives. Every family who lived in the village lost a relative. In many families, fathers and sons died. The bodies were buried in Wollongong Cemetery, Mount Kembla Cemetery and in an unmarked communal grave near a cricket field in Windy Gully. In describing how she came to write the play, Richardson said: Windy Gully proved very popular, going on interstate tour of mining towns in Queensland and New South Wales and being performed at the New Theatre in Sydney in 1989.

At seven years of age, his name was changed to 'Satyam Kavyen Temperley'‚ÄîTemperley is his mother's maiden name and 'Satyam Kavyen' means \\"Poet of Truth\\". The Temperley family were members of the 'Orange People' (Rajneesh movement) and made trips to Oregon, United States (US) and India throughout the early 1980s. Between the ages of seven and 12, Temperley attended the Lance Holt School, a Fremantle community school. At the age of thirteen, he accompanied his mother on a trip to India, where they stayed at the Osho International Meditation Resort in Pune. It was during this trip that he enrolled an international alternative boarding school in Devon called Ko Hsuan that is based on the teachings of controversial Indian mystic Osho. Temperley was accepted as a boarder and remained at the school for a year: Temperley referred to his time at Ko Hsuan as his \\"saving grace\\", and it was there that he discovered a passion for music before he returned to Fremantle and John Curtin High School due to homesickness: Musical career At the age of seventeen, Temperley met future band member Joel Quartermain during a musical performance by the latter at Temperley's high school. At the time, Temperley was already friends with Stuart MacLeod, as they were neighbours since the age of 6. At the age of eighteen, Temperley returned to England in an attempt to re-kindle friendships with his former classmates at Ko Hsuan. He subsequently returned to India, where he again stayed at Pune. While in India, Temperley decided to become more serious about his music. In a letter to MacLeod, he states Upon his return to Fremantle, Temperley informed Quartermain of his decision; at the time, Quartermain was playing in funk metal band Freud's Pillow. While at university, Temperley, MacLeod and Quartermain formed Eskimo Joe for a Battle of the Bands competition. Initially, Temperley had written a number of folk- type and power pop songs, and he later revealed the band's thinking at the time: Temperley sang a reinterpreted version of the song \\"To Look at You\\", with INXS, on the 2010 cover version album Original Sin. In August 2018 Temperley announced his debut solo record 'All Your Devotion' and released the first single from it, 'Pollyanna'. The Album is to be released on 28 September. ==Other activities== A National Office for Live Music was launched by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in July 2013 and, as of August 2013, Temperley is the state ambassador for Western Australia. 2015 - Curated for APRA song hub 2016 - Created production 'Songs From The Suburbs, Songs From The Sea' for Fremantle Festival 2017 - Composed and produced The Shower Song for water awareness Mentor and Educator Over the past 4 years Kav and his now partner Beth Ivers have been running songwriting workshops for teens and emerging musicians around the country.

It was started in 1958 by Raymond Chandler, who left it unfinished at his death in 1959. The four chapters he had completed, which bore the working title The Poodle Springs Story, were subsequently published in Raymond Chandler Speaking (1962), a collection of excerpts from letters and unpublished writings. In 1988, on the occasion of the centenary of Chandler's birth, the crime writer Robert B. Parker was asked by the estate of Raymond Chandler to complete the novel. ==Plot summary== Marlowe has married Linda Loring, the rich daughter of local tycoon Harlan Potter. Linda and Marlowe first met in The Long Goodbye and their romance is resumed at the end of Playback. Marlowe resists financial dependence on his willing wife and, after the couple relocate to a grand mansion in Poodle Springs (a mocking reference to Palm Springs), opens a detective agency in the resort. Tension between them rises when, as a result, Marlowe absents himself from the cocktail parties and other social events organised by Linda‚Äôs set. Marlowe‚Äôs first case comes when he is forced by hoodlums to visit a local criminal named Lipschultz, who operates an illegal gambling house in Riverside, just outside the jurisdiction of Poodle Springs. He has taken an IOU for $100,000 from one of his customers, a Poodle Springs photographer called Les Valentine. Lipshultz's boss, an unrevealed local tycoon, has found out that the sum is missing from the books and has issued a 30-day ultimatum to retrieve the money. Asked to find Valentine, Marlowe accepts on condition that he does not have to shake Valentine down. When Marlowe questions Valentine's wife, Muffy Blackstone, a spoiled socialite and acquaintance of his own wife, she tells him that Valentine is out on a photo shoot. Instead he eventually discovers that Valentine is an alias for a sleazy individual living in Los Angeles with a second wife. When Marlowe calls on Lipshultz again, he finds him killed in his casino office and assists Valentine to escape after he is suspected, not just for this crime but for an earlier slaying in his own office. The melodramatic pay-off exposes the corruption of the Southern Californian rich and confirms Marlowe in his decision to return to Los Angeles. His marriage is wrecked, but he and Linda remain as lovers. ==Contributions== Chandler's first four chapters of the story are used complete and unabridged in this edition. These opening chapters describe the Marlowes' arrival in Poodle Springs fresh from their honeymoon, the large bungalow they live in and Marlowe's insistence on independence, and they introduce the principal characters (Philip Marlowe, Linda Loring and Manny Lipshultz) and several supporting characters. Parker wrote the other chapters. In 1991 Parker followed this novel with a new novel featuring Marlowe, Perchance to Dream, a sequel to Chandler's The Big Sleep. ==In other media== The novel was adapted for a film of the same title by the premium cable channel HBO in 1998, starring James Caan as Marlowe. An adaptation for BBC Radio 4 was broadcast in October 2011, starring Toby Stephens as Marlowe. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:1989 American novels Category:Novels by Raymond Chandler Category:Novels by Robert B.

The Order was founded by St. John Leonardi, who worked with this community to spread devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the Forty Hours devotion, and frequent reception of the Blessed Sacrament. Its members use the suffix of O.M.D. ==History== St. John Leonardi, O.M.D., founder Leonardi, son of middle- class parents, who was born in 1541 at Diecimo (now within the comune of Borgo a Mozzano) in the Republic of Lucca. He was ordained on December 22, 1572. Leonardi's Order may be said to have begun in 1574. Two or three young laymen, attracted by his sanctity and the sweetness of his character, had gathered round him to submit themselves to his spiritual guidance and help him in the work for the reform of manners and the saving of souls which he had begun even as a layman. Leonardi rented the Church of Santa Maria della Rosa in Lucca and, in a quarter close by, something like community life was started. It was here, when it became evident that his lay helpers were preparing for the priesthood and that something like a religious order was in process of formation, that a storm of persecution broke out against the devoted founder. The leaders of the Republic or Lucca seem to have had a real fear that a native religious order, if spread over Italy, would cause the affairs of the little state to become too well known to its neighbours. The persecution, however, was so effective and lasting, that Leonardi practically spent the rest of his life in banished from Lucca, only being now and again admitted by special decree of the Senate, unwillingly extracted under papal pressure. In 1580 Giovanni acquired secretly the ancient Church of Santa Maria Cortelandini (popularly known as Santa Maria Nera) which the Order holds to this day. In 1583, the congregation was canonically erected at the instigation of Pope Gregory XIII by Alessandro Guidiccioni, Bishop of Lucca, and confirmed by the papal Brief of Clement VIII \\"Ex quo divina majestas\\", 13 October 1595. The congregation at this time only took simple vows of chastity, perseverance, and obedience, and was known as the Congregation of Clerics Secular of the Blessed Virgin. In 1596 Pope Clement VIII nominated Leonardi as Commissary Apostolic for the reform of the Benedictine monks of the Order of Monte Vergine and in 1601 their Cardinal Protector appointed him to carry out a similar work among the Vallombrosans. In 1601, he obtained the Church of Santa Maria in Portico in Rome. In the same year, Cardinal Baronius became protector of the Order. Leonardi died in Rome 9 October 1609, aged 68, and was buried at Santa Maria in Portico, Rome. The present church of the order in Rome, obtained in 1662, is Santa Maria in Campitelli (called also Santa Maria in Portico), which also served as the first titular church of the Cardinal of York. The body of the founder was moved to this church and lies there, under the altar of St John the Baptist. Leonardi was declared Venerable in 1701, beatified by Pope Pius IX in 1861, and canonized by Pope Pius XI on 17 April 1938. His feast day is celebrated on 9 October in the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church. In 1614, Pope Paul V confided to the congregation the care of the so-called Pious Schools. It is in his Brief \\"Inter Pastoralis\\" that the congregation is first called \\"of the Mother of God\\", having until then been known by its original name of \\"Clerics Secular of the Blessed Virgin\\". The care of these schools being considered outside the scope of the congregation, it was relieved of their charge by the same pontiff in 1617. It was not until 3 November 1621 that Pope Gregory XV, carrying out what was always in the founder's mind, erected the congregation into a religious order proper by permitting its members to take solemn vows, and it then became the Clerics Regular of the Mother of God. Leonardi received many offers of churches during his life, but, hoping to reconcile with the governing body of the Republic, thought it better to refuse them. In all its history the Order has never had more than 15 churches. In 2008 it had eight, all of them in Italy. They include that of Santa Maria Corteorlandi in Lucca and Santa Maria in Campitelli in Rome. In the sacristy of Santa Maria Cortelandini is preserved a large portion of a hairshirt of St. Thomas of Canterbury whose feast is celebrated there with considerable ceremony; in 1908 half of this relic was presented to the Benedictine Abbey of St. Thomas, Erdington, England. The former residence of the clerics, who kept a large boys' school until the suppression in 1867, became the public library of Lucca. Two of the original companions of the founder, Cesare Franciotti and Giovanni Cioni, have been declared Venerable by the Catholic Church. The Order is known for numerous scholars and writers. Notable among them is Giovanni Domenico Mansi, editor of the \\"Councils\\" and a hundred other works. The coat of arms of the Order are azure, representing Our Lady Assumed into Heaven; and its badge and seal the monogram of the Mother of God in Greek characters. ==References== * ==External links== *Official website of the Clerks Regular of the Mother of God of Lucca (in Italian) *Official site of the Clerics Regular of the Mother of God, Nigerian Delegation (in English) Category:Clerics regular Category:1574 establishments in Europe Category:Religious organizations established in the 1570s ","title":"Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of Lucca"},{"id":"5571608","text":"NeXTdimension (ND) was an accelerated 32-bit color board manufactured and sold by NeXT from 1991Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful ..., By Owen W.

It was included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a reliever airport. Spadaro was connected to Lufker Airport via a taxiway and aircraft are able to taxi from one airport to the other. It was named for Bartholomew Spadaro, who originally owned the airport.http://www.leagle.com/decision- result/?xmldoc/1994737204AD2d533_2249.xml/docbase/CSLWAR2-1986-2006 == Facilities and aircraft == Spadaro Airport covered an area of 50 acres (20 ha) at an elevation of 50 feet (15 m) above mean sea level. It had one runway designated 18/36 with an asphalt surface measuring 2,400 by 25 feet (732 x 8 m). For the 12-month period ending September 8, 2010, the airport had 6,100 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 16 per day. At that time there were 29 aircraft based at this airport: 52% ultralight, 41% single- engine, 3% multi-engine, and 3% helicopter. Bart Spadaro (founder of the airport) died October 5, 2013, at which time Susan Spadaro (Bart's daughter) had assumed control of the airport. Since then, aviation services such as aircraft maintenance, aircraft repair, aircraft inspections, aircraft rentals, flight instruction, sightseeing, etc. were no longer available at this facility. Skydiving operations continued at the airport and were provided by an independent operator. Airport maintenance was the removal of debris around the perimeter of the airport as well as removal of abandoned vehicles and hangars. The dirt taxiway was not very well maintained. The segmented circle was typically overgrown with weeds and was not visible during warmer months. There were no wind sock, flags or any other devices on the field to indicate wind direction or wind speed. The asphalt runway surface was in generally good condition although there was a pothole near the beginning of runway 18 on the right side. Markings for runway 18 were faded to the point of no longer being visible. Adjacent to the runway was mostly bare sandy ground that was prone to creating dust clouds and flung gravel in the presence of propeller blast. Susan Spadaro is not known to hold any credentials in the field of aviation. As of 2016, the airport is closed to operations. The town of Brookhaven decided to shut down the airport, due to failure of pilots to action the noise abatement procedures established by the town, bringing a series of complaints that led to its closure, as well as the closure of Lufker Airport for three months. In 2018, the airport and the land were listed for sale, the listing price, 2,900,000 USD. == References  External links == * at New York State DOT Airport Directory * Aerial image as of April 1994 from USGS The National Map * Category:Brookhaven, New York Category:Airports in Suffolk County, New York ","title":"Spadaro Airport"},{"id":"5571631","text":"The Mus√©e de l'Orangerie is an art gallery of impressionist and post- impressionist paintings located in the west corner of the Tuileries Gardens next to the Place de la Concorde in Paris.

The building was built by architect Firmin Bourgeois (1786-1853). Bourgeois built the Orangerie out of glass on the Seine side to allow light to the trees but the opposite side is almost completely windowless to protect the citrus trees from the cold winds. Before the Orangerie was built, the trees were stored in the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. The main entrances on the east and west side of the building were decorated by architect Louis Visconti (1791-1853) who is also known for his renovations on the Louvre. The columns located at the doors are topped by triangular pediments that were sculpted by Charles Gallois- Poignant. The tops of the columns represent cornucopias, plants and ears of corn that relate to the building's agricultural function. After the Fall of the Empire in 1870 and the fire at the Tuileries Palace in 1871, the Orangerie became a property of the State, which continued to use the Orangerie in its original function as well as for public events such as music concerts, art expositions, contests and dog shows until 1922. ==Monet's Water Lilies== Claude Monet's Nymph√©as on display in the museum. alt= After World War I, new changes came to the Orangerie.

The goal for these two buildings was to provide a space for living artists to display their works. At the time, Claude Monet (1840-1926) was painting a series of Water Lillies (Nymph√©as) paintings for the State that were destined for another museum, the Rodin. The President of the Council, Georges Clemenceau (1841-1929), wanted the paintings placed in the Orangerie instead. The Water Lillies donation to the Orangerie was finalized in 1922. Monet helped with the architectural design along with the architect Camille Lefevre (1876-1946). Eight panels, each two meters high and spanning 91 meters in length, are arranged in 2 oval rooms which form the infinity symbol. Monet also required skylights for observing the paintings in natural light.. Due to the east to west orientation of the building, the rooms are in the path of the sun which stretches along the same axis as the Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre. Originally, the museum was inaugurated on May 17th 1927 as the Mus√©e Claude Monet, a few months after the artist‚Äôs death. It was then annexed into the Mus√©e du Luxembourg and formally renamed the Mus√©e National de l‚ÄôOrangerie des Tuileries.center == Exhibits between 1930-1950 == The Orangerie was joined with the Louvre in 1930. The western half of the Orangerie was dedicated to temporary exhibitions for the Louvre and other national museums in France. Each year, the Orangerie hosted a variety of exhibitions. From 1930-1933, the Orangerie hosted an exhibition on impressionism. In 1934, the exhibition Peintres de la realit√© (Painters of Reality) was dedicated to the 17th century and became famous. In 1936, the exhibition Rubens et son temps (Rubens and his Age) attracted a million visitors to the museum. There was an entire exhibition dedicated to Degas in 1937, titled in his name. In 1942, there was an exhibition dedicated entirely to Arno Breker, who was an official artist of the Third Reich and who studied in France. In 1946, after the end of WWII, many masterpieces from private collections were recovered in Germany by the French Commission for Art Recovery and the Monuments Men and they were displayed in the Orangerie. The Orangerie and the Jeu de Paume were allied with the Paintings Department of the Louvre. The R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux organized successful exhibitions at the Orangerie between 1946-1960. The building of the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais in 1964 was due to the success of the exhibitions of the Orangerie. == The Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume Collection == The Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume collections were acquired in 1959 and 1963 respectively. Domenica Walter (1898-1977) was the widow of both Paul Guillaume (1891-1934) and Jean Walter (1883-1957). Paul Guillaume was an art dealer and his desire was to create a museum of French modern art that would be open to the public. When the State offered to show this collection at the Orangerie after his death, Domenica agreed. Olivier Lahalled (1960-1965) executed the renovation project to accommodate the new acquisition. The existing exhibition galleries were knocked down and two levels were added to the building. A staircase with a banister was designed by Raymond Subes (1893-1970) which replaced the entrance to the Water Lillies paintings and led to rooms that displayed the new collection. In 1966, the collection was publicly presented and inaugurated by the Minister of Culture, Andr√© Malraux, however, Domenica officially owned the paintings until her death in 1977. There was a third renovation project conducted between 1978-1984 to consolidate the buildings, refurbish the rooms and permanently house the collection which was given to the Orangerie after Domenica‚Äôs death. The Orangerie then became separate from the administration of the Louvre and the Jeu de Paume, whose impressionist paintings would be destined for the future Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay. == Renovations between 2000-2006 == The most recent renovation was made by Olivier Brochet between 2000-2006. The rooms that were previously constructed on two levels were knocked down and natural light was restored to the Water Lillies. In order to display the Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume collection, rooms were dug out of the basement level. Temporary exhibition spaces, an auditorium, an education space and a library were also created. The renovations were delayed and changed after the discovery of remains of the Louis XIII wall which was constructed in 1566 to protect the Tuileries Palace. The museum was reopened on May 17, 2006. In 2010 the Orangerie and the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay were linked administratively. On occasion, the Orangerie still hosts dance and piano concerts and other events in the restored Water Lillies gallery. ==In popular culture== The Mus√©e de l'Orangerie, specifically the Water Lilies paintings, were featured in Woody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris. == Timeline == The official site of the Orangerie presents a full historical timeline == References Bibliography== * Georgel, Pierre (trans. from the French by John Adamson) (2006).

Educated at Bolton School, Holt immersed himself in organ, piano and visual art during his sixth form years. In 1976, he attended Bolton College of Art for a year where he fulfilled a foundation course in all areas of visual representation. Shortly before achieving a diploma in composition from the Royal Northern College of Music, where he studied with Anthony Gilbert for four years from 1978 to 1982, he received a commission from the London Sinfonietta, which became Kites (1983). He was soon firmly established with a series of commissions and fruitful collaborations including not only with the Sinfonietta, but also the Nash Ensemble and the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, resulting in pieces such as eco-pavan (1998), Sparrow Night (1989) and Lilith (1990) respectively. Inspired by Messiaen, Xenakis and Feldman as well as visual artists such as Goya, Alberto Giacometti and Br√¢ncu»ôi, his music is innately dramatic and impulsive in nature. His output comprises chamber music, concertos, songs, opera, orchestral and piano music. From 2000 onwards, Holt has written several concertos and orchestral pieces, including a table of noises (2007), a percussion concerto for Colin Currie. Holt was Composer in Association with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from 2008 to 2014, working closely with the conductor Thierry Fischer on pieces such as Troubled Light (2008) for orchestra and Morpheus Wakes (2011), a flute concerto written for Emmanuel Pahud, both for the BBC Proms. Previously, Holt had been commissioned to write two orchestral pieces for the BBC Proms; Syrensong (1987), his first orchestral piece, written for the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the viola concerto, walking with the river‚Äôs roar (1991), for Nobuko Imai and the BBC Philharmonic. Recent commissions include the orchestral piece, Surcos (2016), for Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliner Philharmoniker and co-commissioned by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra who gave the UK premiere with the conductor Ilan Volkov and the basset clarinet concerto, Joy Beast (2016), for Mark Simpson and the BBC Philharmonic as part of the New Music Biennial 2017.

In his youth, he was a reader of French magazines like Robinson and Mickey, which featured mainly American comics. One of those that was especially influential on Roba was Katzenjammer Kids. After working as an illustrator for different magazines and publicity agencies, he started to work as an illustrator for Spirou magazine in 1957, where he made small cartoons for the front page for a few years. He also worked on Bonnes Soir√©es, another magazine from the same publisher Dupuis, where he continued the series Sa majest√© mon mari after Albert Uderzo stopped. For Spirou, he made a few short stories with Yvan Delporte and collaborated on different stories of Spirou et Fantasio with Andr√© Franquin, who taught him the basics of making comics, before starting his own main series Boule et Bill in 1959, initially with stories by Maurice Rosy. Next to this series of mainly one-page comics, he started in 1962 La Ribambelle about a group of kids from various countries and racial backgrounds. Roba was both an artist and writer, and wrote most of his own gags for Boule et Bill, while others contributed stories for La Ribambelle. He handed over the drawing of Boule et Bill to Laurent Verron after more than 1000 pages. His work has been translated in fourteen languages and has sold in excess of 25 million copies.

The airport is owned and operated by the Town of East Hampton and located in the town's hamlet of Wainscott. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. As of July 2014, there is a continuing debate about airport use by nonresidents arriving by helicopters, larger private jets, and seaplanes to visit the Hamptons, and in particular, the rotary wing traffic; residents around the airport and in general have complained about noise, the money spent on the airport, and on implications of acceptance of federal funds on local control over traffic. Debates include the repair of runways and fencing, with opponents in favor of unrestricted use promoting federal funding and those favoring restricted use and sound abatement arguing for user fees and that maintain local control; tensions have risen sufficiently that local elections have been determined over politician's views on the issues. Helicopter and seaplane traffic has continued to increase further over the period 2015‚Äì2018, such that large swathes of the rural North and South Forks of Long Island experience noise levels comparable to those encountered close to major commercial airports.Joanne Pilgrim (2014) \\"Outcry Over East Hampton Airport Noise,\\" East Hampton Star, August 28, 2014, see .Ginia Bellafante (2014) \\"Never Rich Enough,\\" The New Times, August 29, 2014,see .Jacob Bernstein (2014) \\"Where Snarl Meets Roar: Airport Noise is Raising Hackles in the Hamptons This Summer The New York Times, July 25, 2014, see . == Facilities and aircraft == left Aircraft parked at East Hampton Airport in August 2017. East Hampton Airport covers an area of 570 acres (231 ha) at an elevation of 55 feet (17 m) above mean sea level. It has two active runways with asphalt surfaces: 10/28 is 4,255 by 100 feet (1,297 x 30 m) and 16/34 is 2,060 by 75 feet (628 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending September 21, 2007, the airport had 31,612 aircraft operations, an average of 86 per day: 52% general aviation, 47.8% air taxi, and 0.2% military. At that time there were 89 aircraft based at this airport: 84.3% single-engine, 5.6% multi-engine, 5.6% jet, and 4.5% helicopter. == Airlines and destinations == HeliFlite founded in 1998, offers on-demand charter service, helicopter management, fractional ownership and a 25-hour HeliCard‚Ñ¢ product; it operates a fleet of twin engine & dual piloted Bell 430 and Sikorsky S76 executive class helicopters. Trump Air provided regularly scheduled helicopter service in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the last scheduled fixed wing airline was East Hampton Airlines, which now offers chartered service. == Non-residential use controversy == There is an historic and continuing controversy centered on non-residential use that peaks in summer months, and generates issues related to noise and traffic, where noise issue from helicopters is particularly acute. In the summer of 2007 US Helicopter announced plans for scheduled service between the airport and the East 34th Street Heliport in New York City (departing the city on Friday afternoons and returning on Sunday evenings, with a roundtrip ticket cost of ~$1,600. In response United States Senator Charles Schumer introduced legislation in July 2007 requiring the Federal Aviation Agency \\"to study helicopter traffic over Long Island, and report within 90 days on ways to reduce noise and divert the flight paths from homes.\\" The New York Times noted that East Hampton Airport is the most popular destination for helicopters from New York City and that there were 2,400 helicopter arrivals and departures from January to June 2007. James L. Brundige, the airport's manager at that time, said helicopter flights had doubled in the past decade. With the advent of smartphone applications allowing helicopter and other flights to be arranged in manner akin to automotive ride-sharing, the issues related to helicopter traffic have risen, leading to town meetings and competing political efforts and tensions. Helicopter traffic at the airport during the summer of 2014 is reported to have increased by approximately 40% over that of the preceding year, pitting \\"the very affluent\\" (town residents) against \\"the exceptionally rich\\" (seasonal non-residents visiting via helicopter). ==Other uses== Marine One was based at the airport for one week in August 1998 and 1999 during week-long visits by Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton to the Georgica Pond home of director Steven Spielberg. Clinton conducted a fundraiser in a hangar at the airport in 1999. The PBS children's television show It's a Big Big World was taped at Wainscott Studios which is the industrial park associated with the airport. == References  External links == * Airport page at Town of East Hampton website * East Hampton Airport (HTO) at NYSDOT Airport Directory * KHTO ‚Äì East Hampton Airport at Yahoo Groups * Aerial image as of April 1994 from USGS The National Map * Category:East Hampton (town), New York Category:Airports in Suffolk County, New York ","title":"East Hampton Airport"},{"id":"5571658","text":"Antonio Giolitti Antonio Giolitti (12 February 1915 ‚Äì 8 February 2010) was an Italian politician and cabinet member. He was the grandson of Giovanni Giolitti, the well-known liberal statesman of the pre-fascist period who served as Prime Minister of Italy five times. ==Biography== Giolitti was born in Rome. He joined the Italian Communist Party (Italian: Partito Comunista Italiano, or PCI) in 1940 and was arrested and tried, but acquitted, for his associations with them. In the spring of 1943 Giolitti resumed his clandestine activities, for the Communist Party, contacting numerous military and political personalities, in order plan the overthrow of the fascist regime. During World War II, Giolitti was seriously wounded in combat. He was sent to France to recover, and was not able to return to Italy until after the end of the conflict. After the war, Giolitti was involved in much political activity: he was junior minister to the Foreign minister for Ferruccio Parri's government, communist deputy to the Constituent Assembly, elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the list of PCI in 1948 and 1953.

He then returned to the Italian Communist Party (PCI) as an independent candidate and he was elected to the Italian Senate. At the end of the Parliamentary term, he withdrew himself from active politics. Antonio Giolitti has written political texts and, in 1992, he published a book with his memoirs. He also participated actively to the Italian cultural activity. In his youth, he was an advisor to the publisher Giulio Einaudi. He collaborated with several cultural magazines, including Lettera Internazionale. In 2006, he was awarded the Cavaliere di Gran Croce, the highest honour bestowed by the President of the Italian Republic. He died in Rome on 8 February 2010. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Politicians from Rome Category:Italian Communist Party politicians Category:Italian Socialist Party politicians Category:Government ministers of Italy Category:Members of the Constituent Assembly of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature I of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature II of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature III of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature IV of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature V of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature VI of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature VII of Italy Category:Senators of Legislature X of Italy Category:Italian European Commissioners Category:Italian resistance members Category:European Commissioners 1977‚Äì1981 Category:European Commissioners 1981‚Äì1985 ","title":"Antonio Giolitti"},{"id":"5571662","text":"Saint-√âtienne-de-Tin√©e () is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in southeastern France.

The mountainous commune is bordered by Italy to the north, with the boundary determined by the watershed line between the two countries. This line of mountain tops contains more than 20 summits exceeding . A large rectangle of land running east/west, Tende is split from north to south by the Roya river valley. The tributary R√©fr√©i river joins the Roya within the limits of Tende. The Col de Tende (Tende Pass), a strategic pass through the Alps to Piedmont, has been modernized to be a road and railway tunnel. ==History== Known to be a populated place in 690,Michelangelo Bruno, Cols of the Alps of Provence, Prouven√ßo Presso, 2001 (Italian edition), p 34 it is unclear when Tende first became an organized settlement. Prehistoric rock engravings have been found in the area, which are now on display in the Mus√©e des Merveilles or in situ. Tende is a medieval village of tumultuous history, having belonged successively to the Count of Ventimiglia in the tenth century, then the Counts of Provence and the Counts of Lascaris of Ventimiglia before being swapped several times between Italy and France. First to the Savoyard state, then the First French Republic (later the Napoleonic Empire), then restored to the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia- Piedmont (which became in 1861 the Kingdom of Italy). From 1861 to 1947 Tende was part of Italy, and was damaged during the Italian invasion of France in 1940. Tende was the last commune to join the French Republic in 1947, which was endorsed by a local referendum, when Italy was forced to cede (after defeat in World War II) some alpine areas to France. The hillside village is overlooked by the spire-like remnants of the main turret of the castle of the Lascaris, which was built in the 14th century as protection from the attacking Count of Provence, Charles d'Anjou. The castle was destroyed in 1692 when King Louis XIV ordered his Marshal, Catinat, to destroy all fortified structures in France that might challenge his rule. The only complete structure that remains is a circular tower, transformed into a clock during the 19th century.Tende Office de Tourisme, \\"Tende, a Short Historical Tour\\" - pamphlet for self- guided walking tour The tolling of the clock's bells can be heard day and night throughout Tende. Tende is located on what was once an important route of the salt trade between Italy and France. During their reign of Tende, the Lascaris would demand a toll of those transporting salt and others passing through the region. ==PopulationCulture== While the main language of Tende is French, most of Tende's residents also speak Tendasque (which can also refer to the villagers themselves), a variety of the Ligurian language with Proven√ßal influences. The Tendasque dialect has many similarities with the Mentonasque of the coast. A map of the County of Nice (in Italian) showing the area of the Kingdom of Savoy annexed in 1860 to France (light brown) and to Italy (yellow). Tende (Tenda in Italian) was in the yellow section. Among the village's youth, Tendasque is less prevalent (about 30%), while many of them can speak Italian. The village recently began celebrating a series of festivals during the summer, each dedicated to an aspect of local culture. One such festival celebrates the Old Tende (the medieval section), and on the second Sunday of each July, a long-standing festival is held in honor of Saint Eloi, patron saint of the village. Sugelli, a distinctive pasta with a thumb print indentation is a local specialty. At the base of the hillside town is a public swimming pool, built around the turn of the millennium. A via ferrata along the tops of the village's mountains attracts climbers. The trail head can be accessed from near the base of the town clock. ==Economy== * Three hydroelectric power stations * Breeding of cows and sheep * Cheeses, honey and jams * Old crystal mine ==Transportation== Tende has a railway station on the Nice/Ventimiglia-Breil-sur-Roya-Cuneo line run by the SNCF, with connecting service from Ventimiglia/Nice in the southwest to Turin to the north. Train services are mostly operated by Trenitalia. The Train des Merveilles, makes a three daily runs from Nice to Tende. Taking the 9.23am train from Nice (arriving at 11.24am) and returning on the 2.47pm train will give you almost three and half good hours for exploration.

It was named after the V√©subie, a local river. ==History== Early years San Martin first appears in recorded history in the 12th century, although there are archaeological remnants of a Romanized indigenous population dating back to the 1st century. The medieval castrum extends along a cliff overlooking Valley of the Madonna through which ran the old Salt Road that extended from the Piedmont to the port city of Nice. It was part of the historic County of Nice until 1860 as San Martino Vesubia. In their 1997 book \\"The Templar Revelation,\\" Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince write that Saint-Martin-de-V√©subie was the \\"site of a legendary massacre of Templars in 1308.\\" Recent times In World War II, the Alpes-Maritimes were occupied by the Italian Fourth Army from 11 November 1942 onwards. The sympathy of the Italian authorities caused the area to become a safe haven for thousands of Jewish refugees. Jews were able to achieve a modicum of safety and legal residency under the Italian authorities, who relocated them to Saint-Martin-V√©subie. The sympathy of the Italian authorities was mainly due to the work of the Italian Jewish banker Angelo Donati, who was living in Nice and convinced them to protect the Jews from French and German persecution. After the Italian Armistice in September 1943, and under direct threat from the German authorities, a thousand of Saint- Martin's Jews made the climb up the Old Salt Road mountain passes in the Gesso Valley and what they thought was the safety of Italy . Aalmost all the remaining Jews in Saint-Martin were arrested and transported to Auschwitz. The local gendarmerie commander, Mar√©chal des logis-chef Landry Mangon and his wife Adrienne took under protection a one year old Jewish child named Jean- Claude Dreymann and another officer Joseph Fougere and his wife Yvonne took the child's five-year-old sister Cecile and presented them as their children during the Gestapo's round-up of Jews and thereby saved their lives. For this noble act and the risks they took on their lives and their families to save Jews, the families of the officers were recognised as Righteous among the Nations at a ceremony that was conducted at the town hall on 5 September 2010.

They return from their expedition and offer some of their catch to Gandji's brother-in-law Wurrpan and his children. Wurrpan discovers that Gandji has kept the highest quality meat for his own family, and the two begin to argue. Gandji says that Wurrpan should catch his own stingray, and throws hot coals into his face. Gandji picks up a rock used for nut grinding and throws it, striking Wurrpan in the chest. In fear of what Wurrpan will do in retaliation, Gandji begins jumping around, and then flying about, higher and higher, until he turns into a jabiru without a beak. Wurrpan fetches a spear to throw at the flying Gandji. The spear strikes Gandji in the back of the head and travels through to his face, protruding and forming a beak. Gandji falls from the sky. Wurrpan and his family turn to flee, turning to emus so that they can run faster.

Bristol declined it, saying that she preferred the flavour when the milk was poured into the cup before the tea. Fisher scoffed that the order of pouring could not affect the flavour. Bristol insisted that it did and that she could tell the difference. Overhearing this debate, William Roach said, \\"Let's test her.\\" Fisher and Roach hastily put together an experiment to test Bristol's ability to identify the order in which the two liquids were poured into several cups. At the conclusion of this experiment, Roach proclaimed that \\"Bristol divined correctly more than enough of those cups into which tea had been poured first to prove her case\\". This has come to be known as the lady tasting tea experiment. This incident led Fisher to do important work in the design of statistically valid experiments based on the statistical significance of experimental results.

Its properties are distinct from woven fabric in that it is more flexible and can be more readily constructed into smaller pieces, making it ideal for socks and hats. ==Weft-knit and warp- knit fabric== There are two basic varieties of knit fabric: weft-knit and warp-knit fabric. Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie. Weft-knit fabrics are easier to make and more common. When cut, they will unravel (run) unless repaired. Warp-knit fabrics are resistant to runs and relatively easy to sew. Raschel lace‚Äîthe most common type of machine made lace‚Äîis a warp knit fabric but using many more guide-bars (12+) than the usual machines which mostly have three or four bars. (14+) ==Structure of knitted fabrics== Courses and wales Structure of stockinette, a common weft-knit fabric. The meandering red path defines one course, the path of the yarn through the fabric. The uppermost white loops are unsecured and \\"active\\", but they secure the red loops suspended from them. In turn, the red loops secure the white loops just below them, which in turn secure the loops below them, and so on. Alternating wales of red and white knit stitches. Each stitch in a wale is suspended from the one above it. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically above and below the mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting is believed to have been developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric. If they are not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; this is known as ripping out, unravelling knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured (\\"active\\" or \\"live\\"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale.A wale, according to Knitting Technology: a Comprehensive Handbook and Practical Guide, is \\"a predominantly vertical column of needle loops generally produced by the same needles at successive (not necessarily all) knitting cycles. A wale starts as soon as an empty needle starts to knit\\" (Spencer 1989:17). To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting. Basic pattern of warp knitting. Parallel yarns zigzag lengthwise along the fabric, each loop securing a loop of an adjacent strand from the previous row. Knitting stitches and stitch patterns Different stitches and stitch combinations affect the properties of knitted fabric. Individual stitches look differently; knit stitches look like \\"V\\"'s stacked vertically, whereas purl stitches look like a wavy horizontal line across the fabric. Patterns and pictures can be created using colors in knitted fabrics by using stitches as \\"pixels\\"; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square. Individual stitches, or rows of stitches, may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop (an elongated stitch), which is the basis for uneven knitting: a row of tall stitches may alternate with one or more rows of short stitches for an interesting visual effect. Short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern. Stitches also affect the physical properties of a fabric. Stockinette stitch forms a smooth nap. Aran knitting patterns are used to create a bulkier fabric to retain heat. Two courses of red yarn illustrating two basic fabric types. The lower red course is knit into the white row below it and is itself knit on the next row; this produces stockinette stitch. The upper red course is purled into the row below and then is knit, consistent with garter stitch. A dropped stitch, or missed stitch, is a common error that creates an extra loop to be fixed. In the simplest knitted fabric pattern, all the stitches are knit or purl; this is known as a garter stitch. Alternating rows of knit stitches and purl stitches produce what is known as a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch. Vertical stripes (ribbing) are possible by having alternating wales of knit and purl stitches. For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of knit stitches are followed by two wales of purl stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row. Fabrics in which the number of knit and purl stitches are not the same, such as stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl; by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) tend to lie flat and drape well. Wales of purl stitches have a tendency to recede, whereas those of knit stitches tend to come forward. Thus, the purl wales in ribbing tend to be invisible, since the neighboring knit wales come forward. Conversely, rows of purl stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches. This is the basis of shadow knitting, in which the appearance of a knitted fabric changes when viewed from different directions. The stitches on the right are right-plaited, whereas the stitches on the left are left- plaited. Right- and left-plaited stitches Both types of plaited stitches give a subtle but interesting visual texture, and tend to draw the fabric inwards, making it stiffer. Plaited stitches are a common method for knitting jewelry from fine metal wire. Illustration of entrelac. The blue and white wales are parallel to each other, but both are perpendicular to the black and gold wales, resembling basket weaving. Edges and joins between fabrics The initial and final edges of a knitted fabric are known as the cast-on and bound/cast-off edges. The side edges are known as the selvages; the word derives from \\"self-edges\\", meaning that the stitches do not need to be secured by anything else. Many types of selvages have been developed, with different elastic and ornamental properties. Edges are introduced within a knitted fabric for button holes, pockets, or decoration, by binding/casting off and re-casting on again (horizontal) or by knitting the fabrics on either side of an edge separately. Two knitted fabrics can be joined by embroidery-based grafting methods, most commonly the Kitchener stitch. New wales can be begun from any of the edges of a knitted fabric; this is known as picking up stitches and is the basis for entrelac, in which the wales run perpendicular to one another in a checkerboard pattern. Illustration of cable knitting. The central braid is formed from 2x2 ribbing in which the background is formed of purl stitches and the cables are each two wales of knit stitches. By changing the order in which the stitches are knit, the wales can be made to cross. Cables, increases, and lace When knit wales cross, a cable is formed. Cables patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic; Aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling. Arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting. In lace knitting, a pattern is formed by making small, stable holes in the fabric. Lace knitting consists of making patterns and pictures using holes in the knit fabric, rather than with the stitches themselves. The large and many holes in lacy knitting makes it extremely elastic; for example, some Shetland \\"wedding-ring\\" shawls are so fine that they may be drawn through a wedding ring. By combining increases and decreases, it is possible to make the direction of a wale slant away from vertical, even in weft knitting. This is the basis for bias knitting, and can be used for visual effect, similar to the direction of a brush-stroke in oil painting. Ornamentations and additions Various point-like ornaments may be added to a knit fabric for their look or to improve the wear of the fabric. Examples include various types of bobbles, sequins and beads. Long loops can also be drawn out and secured, forming a \\"shaggy\\" texture to the fabric; this is known as loop knitting. Additional patterns can be made on the surface of the knitted fabric using embroidery; if the embroidery resembles knitting, it is often called Swiss darning. Various closures for the garments, such as frogs and buttons can be added; usually buttonholes are knitted into the garment, rather than cut. Ornamental pieces may also be knitted separately and then attached using applique. For example, differently colored leaves and petals of a flower could be knit separately and attached to form the final picture. Separately knitted tubes can be applied to a knitted fabric to form complex Celtic knots and other patterns that would be difficult to knit. Unknitted yarns may be worked into knitted fabrics for warmth, as is done in tufting and \\"weaving\\" (also known as \\"couching\\"). ==Properties of fabrics== Schematic of stockinette stitch, the most basic weft-knit fabric The topology of a knitted fabric is relatively complex. Unlike woven fabrics, where strands usually run straight horizontally and vertically, yarn that has been knitted follows a looped path along its row, as with the red strand in the diagram at left, in which the loops of one row have all been pulled through the loops of the row below it. Because there is no single straight line of yarn anywhere in the pattern, a knitted piece of fabric can stretch in all directions. This elasticity is all but unavailable in woven fabrics which only stretch along the bias. Many modern stretchy garments, even as they rely on elastic synthetic materials for some stretch, also achieve at least some of their stretch through knitted patterns. Close-up of front of stockinette stitch Close-up of back of stockinette stitch, also same appearance as reverse stockinette stitch The basic knitted fabric (as in the diagram, and usually called a stocking or stockinette pattern) has a definite \\"right side\\" and \\"wrong side\\". On the right side, the visible portions of the loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of V shapes. On the wrong side, the ends of the loops are visible, both the tops and bottoms, creating a much more bumpy texture sometimes called reverse stockinette. (Despite being the \\"wrong side,\\" reverse stockinette is frequently used as a pattern in its own right.) Because the yarn holding rows together is all on the front, and the yarn holding side-by-side stitches together is all on the back, stockinette fabric has a strong tendency to curl toward the front on the top and bottom, and toward the back on the left and right side. Stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the \\"wrong side\\" stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns. Each fabric has different properties: a garter stitch has much more vertical stretch, while ribbing stretches much more horizontally. Because of their front-back symmetry, these two fabrics have little curl, making them popular as edging, even when their stretch properties are not desired. Different combinations of knit and purl stitches, along with more advanced techniques, generate fabrics of considerably variable consistency, from gauzy to very dense, from highly stretchy to relatively stiff, from flat to tightly curled, and so on. Close-up of knitting Texture The most common texture for a knitted garment is that generated by the flat stockinette stitch‚Äîas seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and T-shirts‚Äîwhich is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl. Other simple textures can be made with nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter stitch, ribbing, and moss and seed stitches. Adding a \\"slip stitch\\" (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns. Close-up of ribbing Some more advanced knitting techniques create a surprising variety of complex textures. Combining certain increases, which can create small eyelet holes in the resulting fabric, with assorted decreases is key to creating knitted lace, a very open fabric resembling lace. Open vertical stripes can be created using the drop-stitch knitting technique. Changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and Aran sweater patterning. Entrelac forms a rich checkerboard texture by knitting small squares, picking up their side edges, and knitting more squares to continue the piece. Fair Isle knitting uses two or more colored yarns to create patterns and forms a thicker and less flexible fabric. The appearance of a garment is also affected by the weight of the yarn, which describes the thickness of the spun fibre. The thicker the yarn, the more visible and apparent stitches will be; the thinner the yarn, the finer the texture. Color Plenty of finished knitting projects never use more than a single color of yarn, but there are many ways to work in multiple colors. Some yarns are dyed to be either variegated (changing color every few stitches in a random fashion) or self-striping (changing every few rows). More complicated techniques permit large fields of color (intarsia, for example), busy small-scale patterns of color (such as Fair Isle), or both (double knitting and slip-stitch color, for example). Composition of knitted fabrics The most common fibres used for knitted fabrics are cotton & viscose with or without elastane, these tend to be single jersey construction and are used for most t-shirt style tops. Knitted dress, 1967 == History of fashion knitwear== Coco Chanel's 1916 use of jersey in her hugely influential suits was a turning point for knitwear, which became associated with the woman.Vargas, Whitney. \\"Knitting Circle.\\" Elle (Sept 2007): p192. Shortly afterwards, Jean Patou's cubist-inspired, color-blocked knits were the sportswear of choice. In the 1940s came the iconic wearing of body-skimming sweaters by sex symbols like Lana Turner and Jane Russell, though the 1950s were dominated by conservative popcorn knits. The swinging 1960s were famously manifested in Missoni's colorful zigzag knitwear. This era also saw the rise both of Sonia Rykiel, dubbed the \\"Queen of Knitwear\\" for her vibrant striped sweaters and her clingy dresses, and of Kennedy-inspired preppy sweaters. In the 1980s, knitwear emerged from the realm of sportswear to dominate high fashion; notable designs included Romeo Gigli's \\"haute-bohemian cocoon coats\\" and Ralph Lauren's floor-length cashmere turtlenecks.

It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a reliever airport. The airport is located on East Lake Drive between Lake Montauk and Block Island Sound. It is the easternmost airport in New York State. ==History== Montauk Airport was constructed in 1957 to improve access to the East End community, which was being developed as a summer resort. Perry Duryea Jr., a former pilot of the Naval Air Transport Service, was one of the early partners of the corporation that developed the airport, and often piloted his own plane between Montauk and Albany while serving as a member of the New York State Assembly. The following year, regular flights were proposed between Montauk and LaGuardia Airport in New York City during the summer season for use by vacationers and sport fishermen. In 1961 there was attempt by Suffolk County to buy the airport and turn it into a county airport however the deal fell through. The small airport has been used by various celebrities visiting the Hamptons including the Mick Jagger who was inspired to write a 1976 song Memory Motel based on an actual Montauk motel. He and Bianca Jagger had been staying at the estate of Andy Warhol near Montauk. Other celebrities spotted at the airport included Sarah Ferguson, Nicole Kidman, Robert De Niro, Jimmy Buffett, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Lou Reed. In 2007, Montauk Airport received two grants from the Federal Aviation Administration to install an Automated Weather Observing System to provide pilots with current weather conditions at the airport and a Precision Approach Path Indicator to visually alert pilots if they are on the glidepath while preparing to land. An additional grant was received from the FAA in 2008 to install taxiway edge lights. In July 2012 the airport was listed as for sale by descendants of the original owners including Duryea's son Chip with Douglas Elliman Real Estate agents Paul Brennan and Ronald White. The price of the property is $18 million. East Hampton town (which owns the much bigger East Hampton Airport 15 miles west of the Montauk airport), Suffolk County and the State of New York have all said they do not have the funds to buy the airport. They have said the airport would be legally required to remain an airport until 2019 since it had received an FAA grant in 2009. Under zoning requirements it could be divided into six residential lots. == Facilities and aircraft == Montauk Airport covers an area of 40 acres (16 ha) at an elevation of 7 feet (2 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 6/24 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,246 by 75 feet (989 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending September 10, 2010, the airport had 30,361 aircraft operations, an average of 83 per day: 83.5% general aviation and 16.5% air taxi. At that time there were 12 aircraft based at this airport: 75% single-engine and 25% multi- engine. == Airlines and Destinations Incidents== *On March 7, 2009, a Cirrus SR22 went off the runway and burst into flames while practicing a takeoff from the Montauk Airport. The student pilot and instructor escaped from the aircraft without injuries. *On July 31, 2007, a Piper PA-28-181 crashed into trees at the Montauk Airport after aborting a landing and attempting a go-around. The pilot was uninjured and rescued by an airport employee and two people from a nearby beach. *On July 7, 2003, a Piper PA-34-200T crashed into the waters of Big Reed Pond in Montauk County Park after taking off from the Montauk Airport, killing the pilot and two passengers. The men had gone out earlier in the evening on a fishing trip for striped bass and were flying back to Republic Airport during the middle of the night. The plane was discovered the next morning by a family canoeing in the pond. == References  External links == * from New York State DOT * Category:Airports established in 1957 Category:East Hampton (town), New York Category:Airports in Suffolk County, New York ","title":"Montauk Airport"},{"id":"5571763","text":"Koduri Marakathamani Keeravaani, better known as M.

Kyburg Jr.'s lottery paradoxKyburg, H. E. (1961). Probability and the Logic of Rational Belief, Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, p. 197. arises from considering a fair 1,000-ticket lottery that has exactly one winning ticket. If this much is known about the execution of the lottery it is therefore rational to accept that some ticket will win. Suppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99. On these grounds it is presumed rational to accept the proposition that ticket 1 of the lottery will not win. Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will not win either‚Äîindeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket i of the lottery that ticket i will not win. However, accepting that ticket 1 will not win, accepting that ticket 2 will not win, and so on until accepting that ticket 1,000 will not win entails that it is rational to accept that no ticket will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contradictory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins. The lottery paradox was designed to demonstrate that three attractive principles governing rational acceptance lead to contradiction, namely that * It is rational to accept a proposition that is very likely true, * It is irrational to accept a proposition that is known to be inconsistent, and is jointly inconsistent * If it is rational to accept a proposition A and it is rational to accept another proposition A', then it is rational to accept A and A'. The paradox remains of continuing interest because it raises several issues at the foundations of knowledge representation and uncertain reasoning: the relationships between fallibility, corrigible belief and logical consequence; the roles that consistency, statistical evidence and probability play in belief fixation; the precise normative force that logical and probabilistic consistency have on rational belief. ==History== Although the first published statement of the lottery paradox appears in Kyburg's 1961 Probability and the Logic of Rational Belief, the first formulation of the paradox appears in his \\"Probability and Randomness\\", a paper delivered at the 1959 meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, and the 1960 International Congress for the History and Philosophy of Science, but published in the journal Theoria in 1963. This paper is reprinted in Kyburg (1987). ==Smullyan's variation== Raymond Smullyan presents the following variation on the lottery paradox: One is either inconsistent or conceited. Since the human brain is finite, there are a finite number of propositions ‚Ä¶ that one believes. But unless you are conceited, you know that you sometimes make mistakes, and that not everything you believe is true. Therefore, if you are not conceited, you know that at least some of the are false. Yet you believe each of the individually. This is an inconsistency. ==Short guide to the literature== The lottery paradox has become a central topic within epistemology, and the enormous literature surrounding this puzzle threatens to obscure its original purpose. Kyburg proposed the thought experiment to get across a feature of his innovative ideas on probability (Kyburg 1961, Kyburg and Teng 2001), which are built around taking the first two principles above seriously and rejecting the last. For Kyburg, the lottery paradox is not really a paradox: his solution is to restrict aggregation. Even so, for orthodox probabilists the second and third principles are primary, so the first principle is rejected. Here too one will see claims that there is really no paradox but an error: the solution is to reject the first principle, and with it the idea of rational acceptance. For anyone with basic knowledge of probability, the first principle should be rejected: for a very likely event, the rational belief about that event is just that it is very likely, not that it is true. Most of the literature in epistemology approaches the puzzle from the orthodox point of view and grapples with the particular consequences faced by doing so, which is why the lottery is associated with discussions of skepticism (e.g., Klein 1981), and conditions for asserting knowledge claims (e.g., J. P. Hawthorne 2004). It is common to also find proposed resolutions to the puzzle that turn on particular features of the lottery thought experiment (e.g., Pollock 1986), which then invites comparisons of the lottery to other epistemic paradoxes, such as David Makinson's preface paradox, and to \\"lotteries\\" having a different structure. This strategy is addressed in (Kyburg 1997) and also in (Wheeler 2007). An extensive bibliography is included in (Wheeler 2007). Philosophical logicians and AI researchers have tended to be interested in reconciling weakened versions of the three principles, and there are many ways to do this, including Jim Hawthorne and Luc Bovens's (1999) logic of belief, Gregory Wheeler's (2006) use of 1-monotone capacities, Bryson Brown's (1999) application of preservationist para-consistent logics, Igor Douven and Timothy Williamson's (2006) appeal to cumulative non-monotonic logics, Horacio Arlo-Costa's (2007) use of minimal model (classical) modal logics, and Joe Halpern's (2003) use of first-order probability. Finally, philosophers of science, decision scientists, and statisticians are inclined to see the lottery paradox as an early example of the complications one faces in constructing principled methods for aggregating uncertain information, which is now a discipline of its own, with a dedicated journal, Information Fusion, in addition to continuous contributions to general area journals. == See also == * List of paradoxes ==FootnotesReferences== * Arlo-Costa, H.

Today, the UK education imprint is owned by Pearson, the UK trade publications are owned by Penguin Random House and the US education imprint is owned by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. ==Heinemann UK history== William Heinemann began working in the publishing industry under Nicolas Tr√ºbner, who was a major publisher of what was called Oriental scholarship. When, two years after Tr√ºbner's death, his company was taken over by the firm of Kegan Paul, Heinemann left and founded William Heinemann Ltd in Covent Garden, London, in 1890. The first title published was Hall Caine's The Bondman, which was a \\"stunning success\\", selling more than 450,000 copies. The company also released a number of works translated into English under the branding of \\"Heinemann's International Library\\", edited by Edmund Gosse. In 1893, Sydney Pawling became a partner. They became known for publishing the works of Sarah Grand. The company published the British version of Scribners' Great Education Series under the title Heinemann's Great Education Series, but did not include credits for the original American editor, Nicholas Murray Butler, an omission for which they were criticized. Between 1895 and 1897, Heinemann was the publisher of William Ernest Henley's periodical New Review. In the late 1890s, Heinemann and the American publisher Frank Doubleday financially supported Joseph Conrad during his initial attempt at writing what eventually became The Rescue, and Heinemann was the British publisher for Conrad's The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' in 1897. One of the company's businesses at that time was to sell English books to a Japan that was beginning to be interested in items of Western culture. Heinemann sold to the Japanese bookstore Maruzen translations of the works of Dostoyevsky and 5000 copies of Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution by Peter Kropotkin. In 1912, the company began publishing the Loeb Classical Library series, publications of ancient works with the Greek or Latin text on the left-hand page, and a literal translation on the right hand page. The series has been called \\"the most significant\\" of the parallel-text translations. Since 1934, it has been co-published with Harvard University. On Heinemann's death in 1920 a majority stake was purchased by U.S. publisher Doubleday, with Theodore Byard, who had previously been a professional singer, joining to lead the offices. A subsidiary company was established in The Hague in 1953; originally intended to distribute works in English to continental Europe, it eventually began to directly print Heinemann's books as well. The company was later acquired by conglomerate Thomas Tilling in 1961. When the impending takeover became known, Graham Greene (who had been with Heinemann since his first work in 1929) led a number of Heinemann authors who protested by taking their works to other publishers, including The Bodley Head, of which Greene was a director. BTR bought Thomas Tilling in 1983, and were not interested in its publishing division, so Heinemann was put on the block. Heinemann was purchased by the Octopus Publishing Group in 1985, and shortly afterwards sold the sprawling Heinemann HQ in rural Kingswood, Surrey for development; Octopus was purchased by Reed International (now Reed Elsevier) in 1987. Heinemann Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form Butterworth-Heinemann. Random House bought Heinemann's trade publishing (now named William Heinemann) in 1997. Heinemann's educational unit became part of Harcourt Education when Reed Elsevier purchased the company in 2001. Pearson purchased the UK, South African, Australian and New Zealand arms of Harcourt Education in May 2007, while Houghton Mifflin purchased the American operations a few months later. In 1957, Heinemann Educational Books (HEB) created the African Writers Series, spearheaded by Alan Hill and West Africa specialist Van Milne, to focus on publishing the writers of Africa such as Chinua Achebe, who was the first advisory editor of the series. Heinemann was awarded the 1992 Worldaware Award for Social Progress. The series was relaunched by Pearson in 2011.\\"Pearson revives African Writers Series, calls for submissions\\", Naija Stories, 4 August 2011.Nicholas Norbrook, \\"Publishing Africa Writers Series celebrates 50 years\\", The Africa Report, 29 February 2012. Inspired by the African Writers Series, Leon Comber launched the Writing in Asia Series in 1966 from Singapore. Two Austin Coates books in the series, Myself a Mandarin and City of Broken Promises, became bestsellers, but the series, after publishing more than 70 titles, was to fold in 1984 when Heinemann Asia was taken over by a parent group of publishers. In 1970, the Caribbean Writers Series‚Äîmodelled on the African Writers Series‚Äîwas launched by James Currey and others at HEB to republish work by major Caribbean writers.\\"Heinemann Caribbean Writers Series\\", Oxford Index.Caribbean Writers Series, Heinemann. ==Published works== * ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website (UK education) * Official website (US) * Official website (children's) * Charles Pick (Heinemann Group Managing Director, 1979-1985) Archive, University of East Anglia Category:Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Category:Pearson plc Category:Random House Category:Publishing companies established in 1890 ","title":"Heinemann (publisher)"},{"id":"5571860","text":"Heinemann may refer to: * Heinemann (surname) * Heinemann (publisher), a publishing company * Heinemann Park, a.k.a.

Prior to the 19th century the government of the town was divided between the parish vestry and the county magistrates of Lancashire. In 1828 the Oldham Police Act (7 Geo. IV, cap. 117) established a board of improvement commissioners. All landowners owning property worth more than ¬£50 a year or paying an annual rent of ¬£30 were entitled to become a commissioner. In 1848 there were 360 commissioners. Municipal Borough In December 1848 the inhabitant householders of the parliamentary borough of Oldham petitioned the Privy council for a charter of incorporation under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The charter was granted on 13 June 1849, and the Municipal Borough of Oldham came into existence on 1 November. County Borough Under the Local Government Act 1888 all municipal boroughs with a population of 50,000 or more were designated as \\"county boroughs\\" with the powers of both a municipal borough and a county council. In 1889, therefore, the town became the County Borough of Oldham.Local Government Act 1888 C.41, S.31 Although independent of Lancashire County Council, Oldham remained part of the county for certain purposes such as lieutenancy, shrievalty, custos rotulorum and administration of justice. Soon after establishment, the corporation of the county borough promoted a parliamentary bill to extend its boundaries to include four neighbouring local government districts: Chadderton to the west, Crompton to the north, Lees to the east and Royton to the north west. The bill was unsuccessful, and there were only minor boundary adjustments to the borough until the 1950s, while the four surrounding towns became urban districts in their own right in 1894.F A Youngs, Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol 2: Northern England, London 1991 Despite this, in 1926 and 1931, two Oldham Extension Bills for the County Borough of Oldham to amalgamate with Chadderton Urban District were proposed, but rejected by the House of Lords following objections from neighbouring councils... In 1947 the Local Government Boundary Commission recommended that due to the lack of land for the borough's housing programme that its boundaries should be substantially extended.Local government boundaries ‚Äì Commission's proposals, The Times, 16 May 1947 This was not carried out, but in 1951 the borough was enlarged to take in from Limehurst Rural District, and three years later a further were added when the rural district was abolished. The County Borough of Oldham was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 and its territory transferred to Greater Manchester to form a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. ==Corporation and council== The charter of 1849 divided the borough into eight wards, with each ward represented by three councillors and one alderman, creating a town council of thirty-two members. Councillors had a three-year term of office, with one councillor being elected in each ward annually. Aldermen had a six-year term, with half of their number being elected by the council every three years. The council elected a mayor from their membership to head the council at their annual meeting. In 1886 the number of wards was increased to twelve: Clarksfield, Coldhurst, Hartford, Hollinwood, Mumps, St James, St Mary's, St Paul's, St Peter's, Waterhead, Werneth, and Westwood. The size of the council was accordingly increased to forty-eight. In 1954 the borough was enlarged and in the following year a thirteenth ward of Bardsley was formed, and the council increased to fifty-two members. Political control By the 1880s groups aligned with the parliamentary Conservative and Liberal parties contested elections to the borough council. The Liberals (or Radicals) had a majority until 1903, when Conservatives gained control.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1904, p.6 The elections were fought on Home Rule issues for some years in the early years of the 20th century, with Conservatives supporting Unionism, while Liberals were supported by Roman Catholic organisations.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1909, p.12 Liberals were in a majority again following World War I, while Labour councillors began to appear on the council.Municipal Polls, The Times, 2 November 1920, p.12 From 1927 the Conservatives and Liberals combined to oppose Labour. In 1931 Conservatives took control, with Labour forming the opposition.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1927, p.9 In 1934 Labour first took power, and for the next nineteen years the two parties alternated as the majority party.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1934, p.7 From 1953 to 1968 Labour held the borough, the Conservatives were in power from 1968 to 1971 with Labour regaining control for the last three years of the council's existence.The Times, 8 May 1953, p.4; 8 May 1968 p.8; 14 May 1971, p.4 ==Coat of arms== The Coat of Arms of the Oldham County Borough Council, as found at Oldham Police Station. The station predates the merging of Oldham Borough Police into Lancashire Constabulary in 1969, and thus still displays the redundant arms. Prior to 1894, the town council made use of the arms of the Oldham family. The arms were blazoned as: Sable a chevron Or between three owls argent on a chief of the second as many roses gules.Bernard Burke, The General Armory of England, Scotland, Wales; Comprising A Registry of Armorial Bearings From the Earliest To the Present Time London, 1884. The owls suggest that the family, like the town, called itself 'Owdham', and adopted the birds in allusion to its name. It is possible that the family set the Red Rose of Lancaster on their shield to denote their Lancastrian sympathies. The most famous member of the family to use the arms was Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, who died in 1519. The arms form part of the insignia of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, founded by the bishop.C Wilfrid Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 The use of the family arms by the corporation was improper, and on 8 November 1894 they received letters patent from the Kings of Arms granting armorial bearings. The arms were based on the family arms, with necessary heraldic differences introduced to the design. The blazon was as follows: Sable a chevron invected plain cottised Or between three owls argent on a chief engrailed of the second a rose Gules barbed and seeded proper between two annulets also gules, and for a Crest: On a wreath of the colours in front of a rock thereon an owl argent three roses fessewise gules barbed and seeded proper.A C Fox-Davies, The Book of Public Arms, 2nd edition, London, 1915 The Latin motto adopted was Sapere Aude or \\"dare to be wise\\", and was a reference to the owls in the arms. ==References== Notes Bibliography * * ==External links== *A vision of Oldham CB/MB, visionofbritain.org.uk.

The most common rural dish is cooked mutton. In the city, steamed dumplings filled with meat‚Äî\\"buuz\\"‚Äî are popular. The extreme continental climate of Mongolia has influenced the traditional diet. Use of vegetables and spices are limited. Due to geographic proximity and deep historic ties with China and Russia, Mongolian cuisine is also influenced by Chinese and Russian cuisine.Marshall Cavendish Corporation, 2007, p. 268 ==Features== The nomads of Mongolia sustain their lives directly from the products of domesticated animals such as cattle, horses, camels, yaks, sheep, and goats, as well as game. Meat is either cooked, used as an ingredient for soups and dumplings (buuz, khuushuur, , manti), or dried for winter (borts). The Mongolian diet includes a large proportion of animal fat which is necessary for the Mongols to withstand the cold winters and their hard work. Winter temperatures are as low as ‚àí40 ¬∞C (‚àí40 ¬∞F) and outdoor work requires sufficient energy reserves. Milk and cream are used to make a variety of beverages, as well as cheese and similar products.Marshall Cavendish Corporation, 2007, p. 269 The nomads in the countryside are self-supporting on principle. Travelers will find gers marked as guanz in regular intervals near the roadside, which operate as simple restaurants. In the ger, which is a portable dwelling structure (yurt is a Turkic word for a similar shelter, but the name is ger in Mongolian), Mongolians usually cook in a cast-iron or aluminum pot on a small stove, using wood or dry animal dung fuel (argal). ==Common foods== The most common rural dish is cooked mutton, usually without any other ingredients. To accompany the meats, vegetables and flour products may be used to create side dishes as well. In the city, every other local displays a sign saying \\"buuz\\". Those are steamed dumplings filled with meat. Other types of dumplings are boiled in water (, manti), or deep fried in mutton fat (khuushuur). Other dishes combine the meat with rice or fresh noodles made into various stews (', budaatai khuurga) or noodle soups (guriltai sh√∂l).

In this case, the meat (often together with vegetables) gets cooked with the help of stones, which have been preheated in a fire. This either happens with chunks of mutton in a sealed milk can (khorkhog), or within the abdominal cavity of a deboned goat or marmot (boodog). Milk is boiled to separate the cream (√∂r√∂m, clotted cream). The remaining skimmed milk is processed into cheese (byaslag), dried curds (aaruul), yogurt, kefir, and a light milk liquor (shimiin arkhi). The most prominent national beverage is airag, which is fermented mare's milk. A popular cereal is barley, which is fried and malted. The resulting flour (arvain guril) is eaten as a porridge in milk fat and sugar or drunk mixed in milky tea. The everyday beverage is salted milk tea (s√º√ºtei tsai), which may turn into a robust soup by adding rice, meat, or bansh. As a result of the Russian influence during socialism, vodka has also gained some popularity with a surprising number of local brands (usually grain spirits).

He played right field, left field, and first base from 1965 to 1972 for the Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, and Oakland Athletics. He tied a major league record by homering in four consecutive at bats in 1966. He was an integral player on the 1969 World Champion Miracle Mets, batting .300 with 14 home runs (both second on the team) while platooning, and then hitting .538 in the post-season batting cleanup. In 2007, he was the manager of the Modi'in Miracle of the Israel Baseball League. ==Early life== Shamsky is Jewish, and was born in St. Louis to William (whose family came from Ukraine) and Sadie Shamsky (whose family came from Poland), and grew up in its University City neighborhood. He attended University City High School in St. Louis and played on the school's baseball team, as did pitcher Ken Holtzman four years later‚Äîwho in 1972 was his teammate on the Oakland A's. He also played basketball for the school, and graduated at the age of 16. After playing ball for the University of Missouri in his freshman year in 1958‚Äì59, Shamsky was signed by Cincinnati as a free agent in September 1959.Art Shamsky Stats  Baseball-Reference.com He said: \\"My father would have preferred that I had gone into business, but he was into baseball and I think he was thrilled when I signed. My mother certainly wanted me to go to college and become a doctor, of course. What else is a Jewish boy supposed to do?\\" ==Minor league career== Shamsky began his professional baseball career in 1960 with the Geneva Redlegs of the New York‚ÄìPenn League, where he was the roommate of Pete Rose. He finished the season with a .271 batting average and 91 walks (7th in the league), 8 triples (8th in the league), 18 homers (2nd in the league), and 86 RBIs (6th in the league), and led the league's outfielders in assists with 24, and was named to the All-Star team. He played with the Topeka Reds in 1961 (hitting .288 with a .410 on base percentage (9th in the league), .469 slugging percentage (10th in the league), 82 walks (8th in the league) and 15 home runs (tied for ninth in the league), and the Macon Peaches in 1962 (hitting .284 with a .535 slugging percentage (7th in the league) and 16 home runs). Shamsky played with the AAA San Diego Padres in 1963 and 1964, where he hit .267 with 18 home runs his first year and .272 with 25 home runs (7th in the league) his second year. In 1964 he set the record for the longest home run hit in the Padres‚Äô park, at 500 feet. ==Major league career== Cincinnati Reds (1965‚Äì67) In 1965, when he was 23 years old Shamsky made the Cincinnati Reds out of spring training as a sub, and hit .260. In the winter of 1965, he played for Cangrejeros de Santurce in the Puerto Rican Winter League. Shamsky tied a major league record by homering in 4 consecutive at bats for the Reds on August 12 and 14, 1966. The first three home runs were hit in a game in which he was inserted in the eighth inning as part of a double switch.August 12, 1966 Pittsburgh Pirates at Cincinnati Reds Play by Play and Box Score - Baseball-Reference.com He homered in the bottom half of that inning and remained in the game to hit home runs in his next two extra- inning at bats, extending the game each time. The feat made Shamsky the first player in Reds history to hit two home runs in extra innings in one game. He is also the only player in Major League history to hit three home runs in a game in which he was not in the starting lineup. The fourth home run was hit as a pinch hitter in the next game he played, on August 14. His bat from that day is on display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. He finished the year with 21 home runs (second on the team) and 47 RBIs, and a .521 slugging percentage, in only 234 at bats. New York Mets (1968‚Äì71) Shamsky was traded to the New York Mets for infielder Bob Johnson in November 1967. Having suffered from back pain the prior season, he had off-season surgery to have a cyst removed from his tailbone. He initially found living in New York City to be intimidating, but eventually he \\"fell in love with the energy, got to know the city a bit. My life changed.\\" He became a favorite of Jewish fans in New York. In 1969 Shamsky hit .300 (second on the team), with a .375 on-base percentage, a .488 slugging percentage, and 14 home runs (second on the team) as half of a right field platoon with Ron Swoboda for the World Champion Mets. He did this in pain, while suffering from a slipped disk in his back that was pressing against his sciatic nerve; one doctor told him he might never play again. Shamsky was the regular starter against right-handed pitchers, with Swoboda starting against lefties. He batted .385 as a pinch hitter, and .388 in games that were late and close. He still gets comments about his decision to not play on Yom Kippur that year. \\"The funny thing was, the Mets won both ends of a double header\\" that day, he later said. Shamsky's torrid hitting continued into the 1969 post-season. He started all three games of the NLCS, where he batted .538 batting cleanup, leading all batters. In the World Series, Shamsky started only in Game 3, which was played on his 28th birthday. He went hitless in six at-bats in the series. In 1970 he hit .293 (leading the team) with a .371 on-base percentage. Despite only 402 at bats, he was 7th in the league with 13 intentional walks. After an injury-ridden 1971 season, in October 1971 he was traded by the New York Mets with Jim Bibby, Rich Folkers and Charlie Hudson to the St. Louis Cardinals for Jim Beauchamp, Chip Coulter, Harry Parker and Chuck Taylor. In April 1972 he was released by the St. Louis Cardinals, and five days later signed as a free agent with the Chicago Cubs. Chicago Cubs & Oakland A's (1972) In 1972 he played 22 games for the Chicago Cubs and Oakland A's. In June 1972 he was purchased by Oakland from the Cubs, but was released in July. A chronic back injury was a factor in his decision to retire in 1972 at 30 years of age after 13 years in pro baseball, with 68 homers and a World Series ring. ==Halls of Fame== Shamsky is a member of the New York Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. ==Managing career== Shamsky was the Manager of the Modi'in Miracle in the 2007 first season of the Israel Baseball League. Shamsky faced Ken Holtzman as opposing managers for the first All Star game of the Israel Baseball League. The Miracle finished the inaugural 2007 season 22‚Äì19 (.537), in third place, and after upsetting the # 2 Tel Aviv Lightning in the semi-finals, lost to the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox 3‚Äì0 in the championship game. The Israel Baseball League did not resume play after 2007, but Shamsky continued to be active in the Israel Association for Baseball. ==After baseball== After his baseball career, Shamsky became a real estate consultant with First Realty Reserve, and a sports radio and television broadcaster for WFAN, WNYW television, ESPN television, WNEW television Channel 5 in New York City, as well as a play-by- play and color commentator for the New York Mets on radio and television. In addition, he hosted a talk show on WFAN Sports Radio, and has written featured guest editorials for the sports section of The New York Times. He owned a New York restaurant, \\"Legends.\\" He has written two books, including The Magnificent Seasons: How the Jets, Mets, and Knicks Made Sports History and Uplifted a City and the Country, with Barry Zeman (Thomas Dunne Books). The book is about the New York Jets, New York Mets, and New York Knicks all winning championships for the first time in 1969 and 1970. His second book, out in 2019, After the Miracle, written with Erik Sherman, was on the NY Times bestseller list. Shamsky has two beautiful daughters, Toni and Terri, with his first wife, Randee. He enjoys a close relationship with all of them. ==In popular culture== In Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray and Robert's childhood bulldog was named after Shamsky, and as an adult, Robert named his new bulldog Shamsky Number II. Shamsky made an appearance, along with several other members of the 1969 Mets, in the series as themselves ('Big Shots' ‚Äì Season 3, Episode 19). Robert has referred to Shamsky in more than one episode, claiming he homered in his first at bat as a Met, which is actually not true. Comedian Jon Stewart named one of his pit bulls Shamsky, after the player. ==See also== *List of select Jewish baseball players ==ReferencesFurther reading== This chapter in Ruttman's history, based on a June 23, 2007 interview with Shamsky conducted for the book, discusses Shamsky's American, Jewish, baseball, and life experiences from youth to the present. ==External links== *Baseball Library profile *Baseball Page profile Category:Living people Category:1941 births Category:Baseball players from Missouri Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Geneva Redlegs players Category:Israel Baseball League managers Category:Jewish American baseball managers Category:Jewish American baseball players Category:Jewish Major League Baseball players Category:Macon Peaches players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:New York Mets broadcasters Category:New York Mets players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis Category:San Diego Padres (minor league) players Category:Tidewater Tides players Category:Topeka Reds players Category:University of Missouri alumni Category:Wichita Aeros players ","title":"Art Shamsky"},{"id":"5571922","text":"Ikwerre, also spelt as Ikwere, is a language spoken primarily by the Ikwerre people who inhabit Rivers State, Nigeria. == Classification == The Ikwerre language is classified as an Igbo dialect. The classification of Ikwerre as an Igbo dialect however is a subject of controversy among some in the Ikwerre community due to political reasons. Based on lexicostatistical analysis, Kay Williamson originally asserted that the Ikwerre, Ekpeye, Ogba, Etche and Igbo languages belonged to the same language cluster, but were not dialects. Subsequent studies by both Williamson and Roger Blench concluded that Igbo, Ikwerre, Ogba and their sister languages apart from Ekpeye form a \\"language cluster\\" and that they are somewhat mutually intelligible. There are indications that the Ikwerre society was bilingual even in the pre-colonial Nigeria, with people speaking other Igbo dialects and Ikwerre. ==Phonology== Vowels Ikwerre distinguishes vowels by quality (frontedness and height), the presence or absence of nasalization, and the presence or absence of advanced tongue root. {   center;\\" - !colspan=\\"2\\" !

This sound is realized as or a syllabic nasal which is homorganic to the following consonant. Vowel harmony Ikwerre exhibits two kinds of vowel harmony: #Every vowel in an Ikwerre word, with a few exceptions, agrees with the other vowels in the word as to the presence or absence of advanced tongue root. #Vowels of the same height in adjacent syllables must all be either front or back, i.e. the pairs & , & , & , and & cannot occur in adjacent syllables. Vowels of different heights, however, need not match for frontness/backness either.

To the uninitiated, a ballpark description of PI would be modern-day Marillion meets Pink Floyd. Importantly though, PI have developed their own distinctive and individual approach, thus ensuring their own sound. ==History== Formed in 1987, the original line-up consisted of Nick Sheridan (guitar and vocals), Andy Quinnel (keyboards), Billy Geddes (bass), Nick Brown (guitar) and Richard Culham (drums). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they gigged constantly, building up an ever- increasing fan base in the south-east of England, later to spread around Great Britain and abroad. During this period they released four cassette-only fan albums (A Primitive Instinct, Once Round Your Ear, On A Rainy Night and Into The Ocean). The early 1990s heralded the arrival of bassist \\"Pic\\" Hayes, who remains today, as the nucleus of the band with Sheridan. Nick Brown also left the band around the same time. In 1994, PI secured a deal with Cyclops Records, releasing their first CD album, Floating Tangibility. Meeting with widespread critical acclaim from all quarters it sold several thousand copies with very little promotion. The 1990s saw them securing support slots with the likes of IQ, Pendragon, and John Wetton, with the latter musician being particularly impressed by their live show. Richard Culham was replaced by Chris Brown (drums) in 1995. In a similar manner to Tom Scholz of Boston, principal songwriter Sheridan does not rush to follow up albums, and to stem the demand from fans waiting for a follow up to Floating Tangibility, PI released a cherry-picked selection of early demos as \\"Ice For Eskimos\\" in 1998. Andy Quinnell left to pursue a career in banking leaving PI to continue as a three-piece. ==Belief== A new album proved to be worth the long wait for it, when in 2000 PI released Belief. Setting the benchmark for future releases by the band, it combines great songwriting, memorable choruses and a sense of the epic. The early \\"Noughties\\" saw PI promoting Belief extensively with gigs across the UK and Europe, and the Belief album received many excellent reviews and much critical acclaim from across the world. In 2005 Chris Brown left to run a diving centre in Florida and was replaced on drums by long-term fan Stuart Bailey. ==25th anniversary== On 3 November 2012 Primitive Instinct performed a special show in their home town to coincide with their 25th anniversary.

They are named after the location of their motherhouse founded in Vallombrosa (), situated 30 km from Florence on the northwest slope of Monte Secchieta in the Pratomagno chain. They use the abbreviation O.S.B. Vall. to distinguish themselves from the Benedictines, who use the abbreviation O.S.B. ==Foundation== The founder, a Florentine named Giovanni Gualberto, a member of the prominent Visdomini family, was born in the year 985 or 995, and died at Passignano in the year 1073, on 12 July, (his feast day is still celebrated on this day); he was canonized in 1193. His brother was murdered, and it was his duty was to avenge the deceased. He met the murderer in a narrow lane on Good Friday and was about to slay him, but when the man threw himself upon the ground with arms outstretched in the form of a cross and begged mercy for the love of Christ, John forgave him. A popular legend holds that on his way home, Giovanni entered the Benedictine Church at San Miniato to pray, and the figure on the crucifix bowed its head to him in recognition of his generosity. This story forms the subject of Burne-Jones's picture The Merciful Knight, and has been adapted by Joseph Henry Shorthouse in John Inglesant. John Gualbert became a Benedictine monk at San Miniato, but left that monastery to lead a more perfect life. His attraction was for the cenobitic, and not eremitic life, so after staying for some time with the monks at Camaldoli, he settled at Vallombrosa, where he founded his monastery.Gunnupuri, Aarthi. \\"These Monks Have A Calling: Making Fresh Italian Cheese ‚Äî In India\\", NPR, January 25, 2017 Mabillon estimates its foundation at a little before 1038. Here, it is said, he and his first companions lived for some years as hermits, but this is rejected by Mart√®ne as inconsistent with the reason for leaving Camaldoli. The chronology of the early days of Vallombrosa has been much disputed. The dates given for the founder's conversion varying between 1004 and 1039, and a Vallumbrosan writer places his arrival at Vallombrosa as early as 1008. The church was consecrated by Rotho, Bishop of Paderborn, in 1038, and Itta, abbess of the neighbouring monastery of Sant' Ellero, donated the site of the new foundation in 1039. The abbess retained the privilege of nominating the superiors, but this right was granted to the monks by Pope Victor II, who confirmed the order in 1056. Two centuries later, in the time of Alexander IV, the nunnery was united with Vallombrosa in spite of the protests of the nuns. San Salvi (Florence) The holy lives of the first monks at Vallombrosa attracted considerable attention and brought many requests for new foundations, but there were few postulants, since few could endure the extraordinary austerity of the rule. Thus only one other monastery, that of San Salvi at Florence, was founded during this period. Then the founder mitigated his rule somewhat and three more monasteries were founded and three others reformed and united with the order during his lifetime. The early Vallombrosans took a considerable part in the struggle of the popes against simony, of which the most famous incident was the ordeal by fire undertaken successfully by St. Peter Igneus in 1068. Shortly before this the monastery of S. Salvi had been burned and the monks ill-treated by the anti-reform party. These events still further increased the reputation of Vallombrosa. Development After the founder's death the order spread rapidly. A papal bull of Urban II in 1090, which took Vallombrosa under the protection of the Holy See, enumerated 15 monasteries aside from the motherhouse. Twelve more are mentioned in a bull of Paschal II in 1115, and 24 others in those of Anastasius IV (1153) and Adrian IV (1156). By the time of Innocent III they numbered over 60. All were situated in Italy, except two monasteries in Sardinia (now part of Italy). About 1087 Andrew of Vallombrosa (d. 1112) founded the monastery of Cornilly in the Diocese of Orl√©ans, and in 1093 the Abbey of Chezal-Beno√Æt, which later became the head of a considerable Benedictine congregation. There are no grounds for the legend given by some writers of the order of a great Vallombrosan Congregation in France with an abbey near Paris, founded by King St. Louis. The Vallombrosan Congregation was reformed in the middle of the fifteenth century by Cassinese Benedictines, and again by John Leonardi at the beginning of the seventeenth century. In 1485, certain abbeys with that of San Salvi at Florence at their head, which had formed a separate congregation, were reunited to the motherhouse by Innocent VIII. At the beginning of the sixteenth century an attempt was made by Abbot- General Milanesi to found a house of studies on university lines at Vallombrosa; but in 1527 the monastery was burned by the troops of Emperor Charles V. It was rebuilt by Abbot Nicolini in 1637, and in 1634 an observatory was established. From 1662‚Äì1680 the order was united to the Sylvestrines. In 1808 Napoleon I's troops plundered Vallombrosa, and the monastery lay deserted till 1815. It was finally suppressed by the Italian Government in 1866. A few monks still remain to look after the church and meteorological station, but the abbey buildings have become a school of forestry that was founded in 1870 on the German model, the only one of its kind in Italy. Vallombrosa is also a health resort. The decline of the order may be ascribed to the hard fate of the motherhouse, to commendams, and to the perpetual wars which ravaged Italy. Practically all the surviving monasteries were suppressed during the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The present Vallombrosan monasteries, besides Vallombrosa itself, are: Passignano, where St. John Gualbert is buried; Santa Trinita at Florence, where the abbot-general resides; Sta Prassede, in Rome; and the celebrated Sanctuary of Montenero near Livorno. The general abbot in charge is Rev. Dom. Giuseppe Casetta OSB. Padre Pierdamiano Spotorno is the Archivist and Librarian of Congregation. Professor Francesco Salvestrini of University of Florence is now the major studious of the congregation. In 2015 the order had nine houses with 73 members (48 priests). ==Rule and functioning== St. John adopted the Rule of Saint Benedict but added greatly to its austerity and penitential character. His idea was to unite the ascetic advantages of the eremitic life to a life in community, while avoiding the dangers of the former. Severe scourging was inflicted for any breach of rule, silence was perpetual, poverty most severely enforced. The rule of enclosure was so strict that the monks might not go out even on an errand of mercy. The main point of divergence lay in the prohibition of the manual work, which is prescribed by St. Benedict. St. John's choir monks were to be pure contemplatives and to this end he introduced the system of lay-brothers who were to attend to the secular business. He was among the first to systematize this institution, and it is probable that it was largely popularized by the Vallumbrosans. The term conversi (lay brothers) occurs for the first time in Abbot Andrew of Strumi's Life of St. John, written at the beginning of the twelfth century. The Vallumbrosans do not, strictly speaking, form a separate order, but a Benedictine congregation, though they are not united to the confederated congregations of the Black Monks. The oldest extant manuscript of the customs of Vallombrosa shows a close relationship with those of Cluny. The Vallumbrosans should be regarded only as Benedictines who followed the customs observed at that time by the Black Benedictines throughout Europe. \\"Horror of simony was a special bond between them and Cluny, and it was only special circumstances which caused them later to be looked upon as a peculiar institute within the Benedictine order\\". The habit, originally grey, then tawny coloured, is now that of the Black Monks. The abbots were originally elected for life but are now elected at the general chapter, held every four years. The Abbot of Vallombrosa, the superior of the whole order, had formerly a seat in the Florentine Senate and bore the additional title of Count of Monte Verde and Gualdo. The shield of the order shows the founder's arm in a tawny-coloured cowl grasping a golden crutch-shaped crozier on a blue ground. The services rendered by the order have been mostly in the field of asceticism. Among the Vallumbrosan saints may be mentioned: St. Veridiana, anchoress (1208‚Äì42); Giovanni Dalle Celle (feast, 10 March); the lay brother Melior (1 August). By the middle of the seventeenth century the order had supplied twelve cardinals and more than 30 bishops. F. E. Hugford (1696‚Äì1771, brother of the painter Ignazio Hugford), is well known as one of the chief promoters of the art of scagliola (imitation of marble in plaster). Abbot- General Tamburini's works on canon law are well known. Galileo was for a time a novice at Vallombrosa and received part of his education there. ==Nuns== Shortly after the founder's death, lay sisters who, under the charge of an aged lay brother, lived in a separate house and performed various household duties were attached to the monastery of Vallombrosa. This institute survived for less than a century, but when they ceased to be attached to the monasteries of monks, these sisters probably continued to lead a conventual life. Blessed Bertha d'Alberti (d. 1163) entered the Vallumbrosan Order at Florence and reformed the convent of Cavriglia in 1153. Saint Humility is usually regarded as the foundress of the Vallumbrosan Nuns. She was born at Faenza about 1226, was married, but with the consent of her husband, who became a monk, entered a monastery of canonesses and afterwards became an anchoress in a cell attached to the Vallumbrosan church of Faenza, where she lived for twelve years. At the request of the abbot-general she then founded a monastery outside Faenza and became its abbess. In 1282, she founded a second convent at Florence, where she died in 1310. She left a number of mystical writings. In 1524, the nuns obtained the Abbey of S. Salvi, Florence. There are still Vallumbrosan nunneries at Faenza and San Gimignano, besides two at Florence. The relics of St. Umilt√† and her disciple Bl. Margherita are venerated at the convent of Spirito Santo at Varlungo. The habit is similar to that of the Benedictine Nuns. ==Notable Vallombrosans== *John Gualbert *Bernard degli Uberti *Peter Igneus *Verdiana *Saint Humility == References Further reading== * I Vallombrosani in Lombardia (XI-XVIII secolo), A cura di F.

Located on the Blackwall Tunnel northern approach road, it is now owned and restored by Leaside Regeneration. Built around 1485, it is thought to be the oldest brick house in London. ==History== The Georgian frontage of Bromley Hall. The Hall is thought to be the oldest brick house in London and was built by Holy Trinity Priory in the 1490s on the foundations of the 12th century Lower Bramerley Manor. These remain visible today in the cellar. Tree ring analysis has established the Hall was constructed around 1485 at the time of the Battle of Bosworth, which signalled the enthronement of Henry Tudor and the beginning of the Tudor period. In the early stages of the project it was discovered by English Heritage and the Museum of London, that the building was once occupied by John Blount, an important figure in the court of Henry VIII and father of Elizabeth Blount, the King's teenage mistress who went on to have a son by the King. The Hall was seized in 1531 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, part of the English Reformation, before being refurbished for personal use by Henry VIII. The Hall was hung with rich tapestries and paintings, and the area was a popular retreat from London for hunting. Despite the toll of years, traces of the early decoration remain, including a carved hunting scene, 1490s beams complete with the original leather washers used for hanging the tapestries, Tudor windows and three 15th and 16th century wall paintings. From the 15th century this was the manor house of Lower Bromley. The building on the corner of Gillender Street was originally thought to be the gatehouse to Bromley Manor, but it has now been established by the Museum of London that it is the main hall itself built between 1482 and 1495. Bromley Hall had many subsequent uses, serving as a gunpowder factory during the English Civil War and later as a calico printing works and a residence for wealthy City merchants. William S. Woodin, an entertainer and author who gave a series of monologues at the Polygraphic Hall, lived at the Manor House, Brunswick Road from 1872 till his death in 1889. During the 1880s it was used by the Regions Beyond Missionary Union to house nurses, and in 1914 it became a paediatric training hospital. ==Modern use== The Hall suffered bomb damage during World War II. It was purchased from the Crown estate by Alfred Tyler, who carried out reconstruction, donating the rare panelwork to the V&A; Museum. It also contained a fine example of a Queen Anne staircase. The Hall was used as both a residence and office for Tylers (London) Ltd and was sold in the late 1990s when it became a carpet warehouse. Bromley Hall fell into disrepair and was placed on the Buildings At Risk register by English Heritage. Bromley Hall was purchased in 2001 by Leaside Regeneration. This partnership has completed a ¬£1.1m restoration project to bring the building back into use as serviced office units for small businesses. Leaside is proposing to use the ground floor for a permanent exhibition on the hall, the manor and the Tudors. It hopes to also provide a meeting room, presentation materials and access to elements of the internal structure. These consist of a staircase, an original Tudor arched oak doorframe and the remains of the cellars of a structure pre-dating Bromley Hall itself. The restoration of Bromley Hall won two London region awards in 2006 from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. ==ReferencesSources== * English Heritage * Leaside Regeneration * No description of this house is contained in any of the historical works relating to the district, but the manor itself is described in Lysons' Environs of London (Middlesex, vol. i., p. 41), and in Dunstan's History of Bromley St. Leonard, pp. 152‚Äì154.

But the title change may also have come due to a mistake, since Serdtse was also the title of another song in the same musical. In 1984, a collection of songs and poems by Vasily Lebedev-Kumach was published in Moscow. The text of this song was arranged in the Leshchenko fashion, but the title was quoted as Kak khorosho na svete zhit'! (How great it is to be alive!) The Russian Romance version of the song has been translated in Polish as Jak wiele jest ≈Çadnych dziewczyn. Later a native Lvivian, Yuri Hnatovsky, performed a Ukrainian version as a Dance cover-version of Yuriy Gnatkovski clip Heart featuring the Tango-club Street people. ==Russian lyrics== {valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100%\\" - !RussianRoman transliterationEnglish translation - width=\\"30%\\" –ö–∞–∫ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–≤—É—à–µ–∫ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏—Ö –ö–∞–∫ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ª–∞—Å–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∏–º—ë–Ω –ù–æ –ª–∏—à—å –æ–¥–Ω–æ –∏–∑ –Ω–∏—Ö —Ç—Ä–µ–≤–æ–∂–∏—Ç –£–Ω–æ—Å—è –ø–æ–∫–æ–π –∏ —Å–æ–Ω - –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –≤–ª—é–±–ª—ë–Ω –õ—é–±–æ–≤—å –Ω–µ—á–∞—è–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–∞–≥—Ä—è–Ω–µ—Ç –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º –µ—ë –Ω–µ –∂–¥—ë—à—å –ò –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä —Å—Ä–∞–∑—É —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ—Ç –£–¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à - –∏ —Ç—ã –ø–æ—ë—à—å –ü—Ä–∏–ø–µ–≤: –°–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ - —Ç–µ–±–µ –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—á–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ–∫–æ—è –°–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ - –∫–∞–∫ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–µ –∂–∏—Ç—å –°–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ - –∫–∞–∫ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ —á—Ç–æ —Ç—ã —Ç–∞–∫–æ–µ –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ —á—Ç–æ —Ç—ã —É–º–µ–µ—à—å —Ç–∞–∫ –ª—é–±–∏—Ç—å width=\\"30%\\" Kak mnogo devushek khoroshikh Kak mnogo laskovykh imyon No lish' odno iz nikh trevozhit Unosya pokoy i son - kogda vlyublyon Lyubov nechayanno nagryanet kogda eyo sovsem ne zhdyosh' i kazhdyi vecher srazu stanet Udivitel'no khorosh - i ty poyosh' Chorus: Serdtse - tebe ne khochetsya pokoya Serdtse - kak khorosho na svete zhit' Serdtse - kak khorosho chto ty takoe Spasibo serdtse, chto ty umeesh' tak lyubit' (the whole song is then repeated instrumentally only, except for the last two lines) width=\\"30%\\" There're so many nice girls!

In the same year, Sergey Penkin did the same. Line 3 and 4 of A are sometimes, e.g. by Konstantin Sokolsky rendered as: \\"no lish' odno menya trevozhit otgonyaya noch' i son, kogda vlyublyon\\" While the second change (\\"chasing away my nightly sleep\\") does not affect the meaning, dropping \\"of them\\" in the third line may actually mean that the singer is not troubled by a girl's name, but by something else. The film Jolly Fellows was shown in Tel-Aviv and the Israeli poet Nathan Alterman wrote new lyrics to be used in the musical \\"Tel- Aviv Ha'Ktana\\", entitling the song \\"Rina\\". The new words are a sardonic dialogue between two lovers. == Arguments == Apart from the argument about the title, and about the original text (some sources say the author of the lyrics had a longer text in mind), there is also a problem with the exact meaning of the word \\"nice\\" (\\"khoroshiy\\"). Some translate as \\"good, well-mannered\\" (not naughty - a humorous approach), others translate as \\"pretty\\". ==References External links == * Tango outside Argentina * \\"Ruhm und bitterer tod des s√§ngers Pjotr K.

Knox, Antonio Pellegrini, 1675-1741 (Oxford University Press), 1995. ==Life== Pellegrini was born in Venice. His father, also called Antonio, was a shoemaker from Padua. Pellegrini was a pupil of the Milanese painter Paolo Pagani. He travelled with his master to Moravia and Vienna in 1690 and was back in Venice in 1696 where he painted his first surviving works. The work of fellow Venetian Sebastiano Ricci had an important influence on his work. He was in Rome from 1699 to 1701. He married Angela Carriera, the sister of Rosalba Carriera, in c.1704. Pellegrini decorated the dome above the staircase at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in 1709. Alexander at the corpse of the dead Darius Pellegrini visited England from 1708 to 1713 at the invitation of the Earl of Manchester. Here he achieved considerable success. He painted murals in a number of English country houses, including at Kimbolton Castle for the Earl of Manchester, Castle Howard (where his work was mostly destroyed in 1940), and Narford Hall, Norfolk, for Sir Andrew Fontaine.G. Knox, \\"Antonio Pellegrini and Marco Ricci at Burlington House and Narford Hall\\", The Burlington Magazine, 1988. Michael Levey, describing Pellegrini's paintings on the staircase at Kimbolton, says that, although painted directly into the wall in oil, \\"they have all the spontaneity and lightness of fresco.Levey 1980, p.50 In London he worked at 31 St James's Square for the Duke of Portland, where George Vertue noted in his notebooks \\"the hall and Staircase and one or two of the great rooms\\". He became a director of Sir Godfrey Kneller's Academy in London in 1711. He submitted designs for decorating the interior dome of the new St Paul's Cathedral, and is said to have been Christopher Wren's favourite painter.

He returned to England in 1719, but was less successful on his second visit, mainly due to competition from other Venetian painters, including Sebastiano Ricci.

The church is located in the eastern part of central Berlin, the borough of Mitte. The area around the church, bounded by Spandauer Stra√üe, Rathausstra√üe, the River Spree and M√ºhlendamm, is known as the Nikolaiviertel 'Nicholas quarter', and is an area of restored medieval buildings (in some cases recent imitations). The church was built between 1220 and 1230, and is thus, along with the Church of Our Lady at Alexanderplatz not far away, the oldest church in Berlin. ==History== Originally a Roman Catholic church, the Church of St. Nicholas became a Lutheran church after the Protestant Reformation in the Electorate of Brandenburg in 1539. In the 17th century, the prominent hymn-writer Paul Gerhardt was the minister of this church, and the composer Johann Crueger was musical director. The prominent Lutheran theologian Provost Philipp Jacob Spener was the minister from 1691 to 1705. From 1913 to 1923, the minister at the Church of St. Nicholas was Wilhelm Wessel, whose son Horst Wessel later became famous as a Nazi: the family lived in the nearby J√ºdenstra√üe.The Horst- Wessel-Lied - A Reappraisal On Reformation Day in 1938 (October 31) the church building served its congregation for the last time.

The congregation later merged with that of the Church of Our Lady. During World War II, the Church of St. Nicholas had its roof and the tops of its towers destroyed as a result of Allied bombing. In 1949 all the vaults and the northern pillars collapsed. The ruins were located in East Berlin, and it was not until 1981 that the officially atheist East German Democratic Republic authorities permitted the rebuilding of the church with old designs and plans. Thus, the Church of St. Nicholas as seen today is largely a reconstruction. Today the church serves again mainly as a museum and occasionally as a concert venue, administered by the Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin (Landesmuseum f√ºr Kultur und Geschichte Berlins). It is renowned for its acoustics and the rebuilt church has been equipped with a fine set of 41 bells. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Nikolaikirche * Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin * Museum Nikolaikirche Nicholas Mitte Nicholas Nicholas Nicholas Berlin Nicholas Berlin Nicholas Nicholas Mitte Berlin Nicholas Berlin Nicholas Nicholas Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures in Berlin Berlin Nicholas Category:Churches completed in 1243 ","title":"St. Nicholas Church, Berlin"},{"id":"5572097","text":"Barrie Michael Lace Stephen, known as Michael Stephen, (born 25 September 1942), was a British Conservative Member of Parliament (MP). ==Early life== Stephen earned a Master of the Science of Law degree from Stanford University in the United States in 1971. ==Parliamentary career== Stephen unsuccessfully contested Doncaster North in 1983.

Defensive formations are classified by the total number of linemen and linebackers in the formation. The three basic types of formations in eight-man football are seven-man fronts, six-man fronts and five-man fronts. As in 11-man football, formations are described in a (number of defensive linemen)-(number of linebackers)-(number of defensive backs) format. ==Seven- man fronts== Seven-man fronts are primarily used either against teams that pose no threat with the passing game or in short-yardage running situations. Even though linebackers have increased pass coverage duties, the emphasis is still on stopping the run. 3-4-1 Consists of either three down linemen or one down lineman and two up lineman, four linebackers and one safety. Linebackers have all pass coverage responsibilities with the safety playing deep cover. When three down lineman are used, outside linebackers have contain responsibilities plus their pass coverage. 4-3-1 The line consists of two tackles and two ends. Tackles line up anywhere between heads up on the offensive guards to the shoulders of the center. Responsible for run stop through the middle of the line. Ends line up in an up position on the outside shoulder of the widest offensive lineman. Acts as the \\"contain\\" man. There are two outside linebackers and one middle linebacker. The middle linebacker lines up between the tackles off the line of scrimmage; this player stops the run up the middle of the formation and has pass coverage on running backs. Outside linebackers line up between the tackles and ends off the line of scrimmage, stopping the runs through the gap between the offensive guard and offensive end (the \\"B gap\\") and has pass coverage on the tight or split ends. The lone defensive back plays a deep zone in pass coverage. 5-2-1 This defense consists of three down linemen, two up linemen, two linebackers and one safety; usually a goal-line defense. ==Six-man fronts== Six-man fronts are usually the most balanced between run stop and pass coverage. 4-2-2 The 4-2-2 defense consists of two tackles, two ends, two linebackers, and two defensive backs. This defense is generally considered to be a balance between run and pass defense. The line consists of two tackles and two ends. The tackles line up usually somewhere between directly opposite the offensive guards and the center; rarely will they be outside the guards. Their job is to control their assigned gaps on run plays and pressure the quarterback on passes. The ends line up on the outside shoulder of the widest offensive lineman; their main responsibility is to turn running plays back inside to the linebackers and defensive backs (in order to contain the run). They occasionally have pass coverage responsibilities and depending on personnel and scheme, may cover split ends and slot receivers. Some teams designate their best contain man to always play the wide side of the field. The linebackers' main role is run support; they line up anywhere between the defensive ends. They can be stacked on the tackles or offset either inside or outside, depending on the tackles' alignment. Pass coverage responsibilities are for running backs coming out of the backfield, running backs in the slot formation, or, in some situations, tight ends. The defensive backs' first concern is to watch for the pass; they are responsible for the ends. They may cover a running back in the slotback position, leaving the tight end for the linebacker. In run plays, they act as a second set of linebackers. 3-3-2 The 3-3-2 formation consists of three linemen, three linebackers and two defensive backs. It is one of the most flexible formations, allowing multiple looks and blitz packages and freeing the middle linebacker from most pass coverage responsibilities; this way, the middle linebacker can be used for stopping the run. The linemen are run stoppers and pass rushers. The nose tackle lines up at any point in between the inside shoulders of the offensive guards. Responsible for stopping running plays through the middle of the line. The player either stands up the center or shoots an A-gap. The defensive ends line up in a down position between the outside shoulder to heads up on the tight end, or in an up position on the outside shoulder of the tight end. In the down position has run stop in the \\"B gap\\". In the up position is the contain man. Linebackers are primarily run stoppers and after that have pass coverage. The middle linebacker lines up in between the offensive guards. This player's main job is to stop the run; to be most effective, the middle linebacker should be the team's best tackler and be able to play from sideline to sideline. Pass coverage is a short zone on any backs coming through the middle of the line. When blitzing, the middle linebacker takes the \\"A gap\\" opposite of the nose tackle, becoming a de facto fourth lineman. The outside linebackers line up behind the defensive ends. They have pass coverage on running backs coming out of the backfield to the flats, can cover slotbacks but may switch with defensive backs. Defensive backs look for the pass first and then the run.
