It is based on events around Operation Long Jump, the 1943 attempt by Nazi Germany to assassinate Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Tehran Conference. The film was the leader of Soviet distribution in 1981 and had 47.5 million viewers. It won the Golden Prize at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival in 1981. Plot Teheran 43 starts in 1980 in Paris. The memories of hero Andrei take the story back to 1943. The Germans planned to assassinate the three men 37 years later, and the German agent Max lives with Fran√ßoise, a young Parisian woman, who hides him. But another Nazi, Scherner, is hunting down Max who failed to carry out the planned assassinations. Max trusts Fran√ßoise but he does not know that she works for Scherner. Another plot in the movie is the romance between Andrei and the French woman Marie in 1943, followed in 1980. Max Richard (Armen Dzhigarkhanyan), an assassin of the Nazis, who was 43 years ago hired to assassinate Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Tehran Conference, is holed up in today's Paris at the young French woman Fran√ßoise (Claude Jade). In flashbacks, he describes Fran√ßoise who claims to be a neighbor in his apartment because she mistook the door, the assassination attempts. Max was brought in 1943 to Tehran as a funeral director of a previously murdered Persian. Max also kills the lawyer of the dead, G√©rard Simon (Gleb Strizhenov). But Simon's interpreter Marie (Natalya Belokhvostikova) and the young Russian Secret agent Andrei (Igor Kostolevsky) get him on the loose. The two have no time for romance but thwart the assassination. They can arrest a fake photographer (Georges G√©ret). The man who posed as a photographer and cinematographer \\"Dennis Pew\\" had a gun in his movie camera. Andrei, who cares for the safety of the young woman, sends Marie, who is in love with him, to France. They do not see each other again. When Max wants to publish his memoirs and documents in Paris today with the help of the lawyer Legraine (Curd J√ºrgens), Andrei travels to Paris. At an auction of Max's documents in London, Andrej sees a young woman who is very similar to Marie. She is Marie's daughter Nathalie. Fran√ßoise, meanwhile Max's mistress, also pursues her own goals. She claims to work for his former client Scherner (Albert Filozov) and to have spared Max only out of pity. In Paris, the paths of Marie and Andreiand of Marie's daughter Nathalie and police inspector Foche (Alain Delon), who chases the former masterminds around Scherner, intersect. During a plane hijacking initiated by Scherner, Andrei meets Nathalie again. Foche, who wants to protect Nathalie's mother, is assassinated in the back. Max gets scared when Marie is killed as a former witness after a short reunion with Andrei. Then, Fran√ßoise takes him to a new hiding place. Andrei visits Nathalie and learns from her that Marie loved him all those years. She told her daughter about swimming together and told her about the dolphins, but those were just her dreams. In his new hideout, Max is shot by Scherner's men. Legraine interrogates Scherner and Fran√ßoise; possibly, he will negotiate with them about the manuscript. Andrei travels back to Moscow.

He is known as one of Europe's most prominent actors and screen sex symbols from the 1960s. He achieved critical acclaim for roles in films such as Rocco and His Brothers (1960), Plein Soleil (1960), L'Eclisse (1962), The Leopard (1963), The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1965), Lost Command (1966) and Le Samoura√Ø (1967). Over the course of his career Delon worked with many well-known directors, including Luchino Visconti, Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville, Michelangelo Antonioni and Louis Malle. He acquired Swiss citizenship in 1999. Early life Alain Delon was born in Sceaux, Seine (now Hauts-de-Seine), √éle-de-France, an upscale suburb of Paris. His parents, √âdith (n√©e Arnold; 1911‚Äì1995) and Fabien Delon (1904‚Äì1977), divorced when Delon was four. Both remarried and as a result, Delon has a half-sister and two half- brothers. His paternal grandmother was Corsican, from Prunelli-di-Fiumorbo. When his parents divorced, Delon was sent to live with foster parents; after the foster parents died, Delon's parents took shared custody of him, but the arrangement proved unsatisfactory. He attended a Catholic boarding school, the first of several schools from which he was expelled because of unruly behavior. Delon left school at 14, and worked for a brief time at his stepfather's butcher shop. He enlisted in the French Navy three years later, aged 17, and during 1953‚Äì1954 he served as a fusilier marin in the First Indochina War. He has said that, of his four years of military service, he spent 11 months in a military jail for being \\"undisciplined\\". Early career In 1956, after being dishonorably discharged from the military, Delon returned to France. He had little money, and got by on whatever employment he could find. He spent time working as a waiter, a porter, a secretary and a sales assistant. During this time he became friends with the actress Brigitte Auber, and joined her on a trip to the Cannes Film Festival, where his film career would begin. First film roles At Cannes, Delon was seen by a talent scout for David O. Selznick. After a screen test Selznick offered him a contract, provided he learn English. Delon returned to Paris to study the language, but when he met French director Yves All√©gret, he was convinced that he should stay in France to begin his career. Selznick allowed Delon to cancel his contract, and All√©gret gave him his debut in the film with Edwige Feuill√®re, Quand la femme s'en m√™le (1957) (Send a Woman When the Devil Fails). Marc All√©gret cast him in Be Beautiful But Shut Up (1958), which featured a young Jean-Paul Belmondo. He was then given his first lead, supporting Romy Schneider in the period romance Christine (1958), based on a novel by Arthur Schnitzler. He and Schneider began a highly publicised romance in real life. The film was the seventeenth most popular movie at the French box office that year. French stardom Delon was given the lead in the comedy Women Are Weak (1959). This was a big hit in FranceMovie box office information at Box Office Story and was the first of Delon's films to be seen in America. Delon made some personal appearances in New York to promote the movie. He was a known associate of Serbian-born gangster Vojislav Stanimirovic and frequented his establishments owned and operated in Manhattan.\\"FOX BUYS CONCERN IN JOHANNESBURG: Film Company in Africa Acquired for $1,125,000 -- 'Anatomy of Murder' Here!\\" by HOWARD THOMPSON. The New York Times, 2 July 1959, pg. 15. International fame Delon next made two films that ensured his international reputation. In 1960, he appeared in Ren√© Cl√©ment's Plein Soleil, released in the US as Purple Noon, which was based on the Patricia Highsmith novel The Talented Mr. Ripley. Delon played protagonist Tom Ripley to critical acclaim; Highsmith was a fan of his portrayal.Peary, Gerald. Interview with Patricia Highsmith , geraldpeary.com; accessed 8 February 2018. The movie was a hit in France and on the art house circuit in English-speaking countries. He then played the title role in Luchino Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers (1960). Critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that Delon's work was \\"touchingly pliant and expressive\\".Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, 28 January 1961. Delon made his stage debut in 1961 in the John Ford play 'Tis Pity She's a Whore alongside Romy Schneider in Paris. Visconti directed the production which broke box office records.\\"POWERLESS GALLIC CRITICS: Parisian Theatregoers Flock to Play That Is Slashed And Stay Away From Another That Is Hailed\\" by JEAN-PIERRE LENOIR PARIS. The New York Times 4 June 1961, pg. X3. He was reunited with Ren√© Cl√©ment in the Italian comedy film about fascism, The Joy of Living (1961). It was a minor success. More popular was an all-star anthology film Famous Love Affairs (1961); Delon's segment cast him as Albert III, Duke of Bavaria, opposite Brigitte Bardot. Around this time Delon was mentioned as a possibility for the lead in Lawrence of Arabia.\\"Two Stars Signed for 'Lawrence' Film\\" Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune 22 March 1961: b5. Peter O'Toole was cast instead, but then Delon was signed by Seven Arts to a four- picture deal, including a big budget international movie of the Marco Polo story and The King of Paris, about Alexandre Dumas. Neither project came to fruition. Instead he was cast by Michelangelo Antonioni opposite Monica Vitti in L'Eclisse (1962), a major critical success, although audiences were small. More popular was another all-star anthology film, The Devil and the Ten Commandments (1963); Delon's segment cast him with Danielle Darrieux. MGM Producer Jacques Bar was making a heist film with Jean Gabin with backing from MGM, titled Any Number Can Win (1963). Gabin's co-star was meant to be Jean-Louis Trintignant until Delon lobbied Bar for the role. He took the film's distribution rights in certain countries instead of a straight salary. Because this had never been done before in France, this was known as \\"Delon's method.\\" The gamble paid off well, with Jean Gabin later claiming that Delon earned 10 times more money than he did as a result. However, in 1965, Delon claimed \\"no one else has tried it since and made money.\\" Nonetheless, the experience gave Delon a taste for producing. He also signed a five-picture deal with MGM, of which Any Number Can Win was the first. His reputation was further enhanced when he worked with Visconti again for Il Gattopardo (The Leopard) with Burt Lancaster and Claudia Cardinale. This was the seventh biggest hit of the year in France; Any Number Can Win was the sixth. The Leopard was also widely screened in the U.S. through 20th Century Fox. Delon was now one of the most popular stars in France. He starred in a swashbuckler, The Black Tulip (1964), from a novel by Alexandre Dumas, another hit. Les F√©lins (1964), which reunited him with Rene Clement and co-starred Jane Fonda, was filmed in French and English versions. The latter was distributed by MGM, but it was not a success.French Movie Actor Bears Resemblance to Jimmy Dean Tinee, Mae. Chicago Tribune 16 February 1964, pg. G15. In 1964, the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise held a showcase of Delon's films and Delon started a production company, Delbeau Production, with Georges Beaume. They produced a film called The Unvanquished (L'insoumis) (1964), where Delon played an OAS assassin. It had to be re-edited because of legal issues. Despite being distributed by MGM, audiences were small. Hollywood star Typecast as a \\"Latin Lover\\", Delon spent the next few years focused on making it in Hollywood. He was quoted in 1965 as saying: He started with a small part in an all-star anthology for MGM titled The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1965), opposite Shirley MacLaine. It was popular although Delon had little to do. He had his first English-language lead in Once a Thief, where he co-starred with Ann- Margret. It was based on a novel by Zekial Marko who had written Any Number Can Win, but it was not as successful. It was financed by MGM who announced Delon would appear in a Western Ready for the Tiger directed by Sam Peckinpah, but the film was never made. Instead, Delon signed a three-picture deal with Columbia, for whom he appeared in the big budget action film Lost Command (1966), playing a member of the French Foreign Legion, alongside Anthony Quinn and Claudia Cardinale. The studio also announced that he would appear in the biopic Cervantes, but this was never made. Universal Studios used Delon in a Western, Texas Across the River, opposite Dean Martin. Ray Stark wanted to use him in The Night of the Iguana and This Property Is Condemned. He did not appear in either film but was in that producer's Is Paris Burning?, directed by Ren√© Clement, playing Jacques Chaban-Delmas. This was a massive hit in France but performed disappointingly at the US box office ‚Äì as did all of Delon's Hollywood-financed films. Delon remained a massive star in France. Along with Steve McQueen and Sean Connery he was one of the biggest stars in Japan.Reisfeld, Bert. \\"Japan Film-makers Make Little Go Long Way\\", Los Angeles Times 12 September 1965, pg. N5. However he could not make headway in the U.S. Return to France After six Hollywood movies Delon returned to France to make The Last Adventure opposite Lino Ventura. It was one of Delon's most popular films of the 1960s but was not popular in North America. He was meant to work again with Visconti in The Stranger but did not end up playing it.A.H. WEILER., \\"The Devils' Get a Movie Angel\\", The New York Times 21 November 1965, pg. X11. Instead he appeared on stage in Paris, Les Yeux Creves and made Le Samoura√Ø with Jean-Pierre Melville, which became another classic. He played an amnesiac in Diabolically Yours (1968) for Julien Duvivier and had a role in another all-star anthology, Spirits of the Dead (1968); his segment was directed by Louis Malle, and co-starred Brigitte Bardot. Delon had another attempt at English-language cinema with The Girl on a Motorcycle (1968) with Marianne Faithfull for director Jack Cardiff. It was a surprise hit in Britain.\\"John Wayne-money-spinner\\" The Guardian, 31 December 1968. Far more popular at the French box office was Farewell Friend (Adieu l'ami), where Delon and Charles Bronson played former legionnaires who get involved in a heist. The film helped turn Charles Bronson into a genuine star in Europe.\\"REX REED REPORTS: Don't page Bronson now--unless you have a million\\" Reed, Rex.

Markoviƒá affair and gangster movies While making the 1969 thriller La Piscine (The Swimming Pool)Histoire du Cin√©ma Fran√ßais 1966‚Äì1970, eds. Maurice Bessy, Raymond Chirat and Andr√© Bernard; ; entry 235 with Romy Schneider, Delon's friend and bodyguard Stevan Markoviƒá was found murdered in a rubbish dumpster near Paris. The police investigation went on to reveal allegations of sex parties involving celebrities such as Delon and members of government including future French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, whose wife, Claude Pompidou, was allegedly the focus of a series of compromising photos at one such party. Corsican crime boss Fran√ßois Marcantoni, a friend of Delon, was suspected of involvement. The affair gained notoriety throughout France and in the French press as the \\"Markoviƒá affair\\". In a 1969 BBC interview, Delon was questioned about his alleged involvement in the death of Markoviƒá, rumours of his involvement in sex parties, and Delon's own sexual tastes. Delon then starred in a series of gangster films. First was Jeff (1969), for his own production company, Adel. The Sicilian Clan (1969) teamed him with Lino Venura and Jean Gabin, and was a blockbuster. Even more popular was Borsalino (1970), which Delon produced and in which he co-starred opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo. Neither of these broke through in the US the way Delon hoped.Kramer, Carol. \\"Top Sex Symbols of French Films Feud at Drop of Hat\\", Chicago Tribune, 16 August 1970, pg. E-1. Neither did The Red Circle, despite Delon appearing with Yves Montand. For a change of pace, he produced a romantic drama, The Love Mates (1971), which was not a success. Neither was a comedy Easy, Down There! (1971). More international films In the early 1970s, Delon made another attempt at the English speaking market. The Assassination of Trotsky (1972) for Joseph Losey was poorly received but Red Sun (1972), with Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune, did well. In France he appeared opposite Simone Signoret in The Widow Couderc (1971). He made his third film with Melville, Un flic (1972). He produced and starred in a romantic drama, Indian Summer (1972), then made some thrillers: Traitement de choc (1973), and Tony Arzenta (1973). In 1973, he recorded a duet with Dalida, \\"Paroles, paroles\\", a popular French-language version of the Italian song \\"Parole parole\\". He tried again for Hollywood stardom with Scorpio (1973), with Burt Lancaster for director Michael Winner. It was only a minor hit. In France, he made The Burned Barns (1973) and Creezy (1974). He produced Two Men in Town (1974) which re-teamed him with Jean Gabin, and Borsalino & Co. (1974), a sequel to his earlier hit. After another gangster thriller, Icy Breasts (1974), Delon returned to his first swashbuckler since The Black Tulip, playing the title character in the 1975 Italian-French film Zorro. He made some more crime filmes: The Gypsy (1975), Flic Story (1975) (with Jean Louis Triginant), Boomerang (1976) and Armaguedon (1976). In 1976, Delon starred in Monsieur Klein, for which he was nominated for the C√©sar Award. Anouchka at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. It was back to crime for another series of thrillers in which he starred as well as produced: Man in a Hurry (1977), Death of a Corrupt Man (1977), Le Gang (1977), Attention, The Kids Are Watching (1978). In 1979, Delon stated only a quarter of his business activities involve films: In 1979 he made a final attempt at Hollywood stardom, signing with agent Sue Mengers and starring in The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979).\\"MOVIES: A TOUGH GUY GOES SOFT ON HOLLYWOOD\\" Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times, 25 February 1979: l36. The film was not a big success. Delon returned to French films which he produced: The Medic (1979) and Three Men to Kill (1980). Later career 1980s and 1990s Teheran 43 (1981) was a change of pace. In this big Soviet production he co-starred with Claude Jade and Curd J√ºrgens in a co-starring role beside Russian actors. Then it was back to crime: For a Cop's Hide (1981), Le choc (1982), Le Battant (1983) (which Delon directed). He was awarded the Best Actor C√©sar Award for his role in Bertrand Blier's Notre histoire (1984), and portrayed the aristocratic dandy Baron de Charlus in a film adaptation of Marcel Proust's novel Swann in Love in the same year. The thrillers resumed: Parole de flic (1986), The Passage, Let Sleeping Cops Lie (1988), and Dancing Machine (1990). One notable film during this time was Jean-Luc Godard's Nouvelle Vague in 1990, in which Delon played twins. Delon's last major role was in Patrice Leconte's Une chance sur deux in 1998, another box office disappointment. Delon announced his decision to give up acting in 1997, although he still occasionally accepts roles. Delon acquired Swiss citizenship on 23 September 1999, and the company managing products sold under his name is based in Geneva. He resides in Ch√™ne-Bougeries in the canton of Geneva. 2000s and 2010s In 2001, Delon starred in the French television drama Fabio Montale. He played an ageing policeman dressed in stylish clothes, a \\"signature Delon\\" role for audiences. The show was a big hit. In 2003, Delon tried to recreate the success of Fabio Montale and produced and starred in another French television police drama, Frank Riva. It did well but less so than Fabio Montale. He starred, in 2008, as Jules Cesar in the box-office hit Asterix aux jeux Olympiques which co-starred G√©rard Depardieu. Around this time he mostly took roles in TV movies and also played some roles on the French stage. He directed a TV movie himself in 2008 co-starring Anouk Aimee, titled Love Letters based on a play by A.R. Gurney. In 2018, after a seven- year hiatus from cinema, Delon was planning to star in a new movie, titled La Maison Vide, co-starring Juliette Binoche and directed by Patrice Leconte. However, in November 2018 the French media announced that the project was canceled. No specific reason was given for the cancelation. His last roles to date have been in the 2011 television movie Une journ√©e ordinaire, in the 2012 Russian production S Novym godom, Mamy! in which he starred as himself and he again appeared as himself in the 2019 movie Toute Ressemblance as a guest in a talkshow. In April 2019, at 83, Delon released a new single. The track, titled Je n'aime que toi, was composed by Rick Allison and Julia Paris. Already in 1973 Delon scored a huge international hit duetting with Egyptian-French singer Dalida on the song Paroles...paroles. In 1983 he collaborated with Shirley Bassey on the international hit song Thought I'd ring you. At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, which was held from 14 to 25 May, Delon was the recipient of an honorary Palme d'Or for his long standing career in the movies. A retrospective of some of his films played at the festival. There was much controversy surrounding Delon receiving this award because of his presumed remarks he made concerning the treatment of women during his career and in his private life. Thierry Fremaux, the artistic director of the festival, told the Cannes audience during a homage at the ceremony, \\"We know that intolerance is back, we're being asked to believe that if we all think the same it will protect us from the risk of being disliked or being wrong, but Alain Delon is not afraid of being wrong, being disliked, and he doesn't think like others, and he's not afraid of being alone\\". \\"For me, it's more than the end of a career. It's the end of a life. It feels that I'm receiving a posthumous tribute while being alive,\\" said Delon. He received the award from his daughter Anouchka Delon. Business career In the 1970s, Delon expanded his interests. He bought trotters and promoted fights. Since the formation of a perfume label in his name, Delon has had a variety of products sold under his name including wristwatches, clothing, eyewear, stationery and cigarettes. Delon's sunglasses brand became particularly popular in Hong Kong after actor Chow Yun-fat wore them in the 1986 crime film A Better Tomorrow (as well as two sequels). Delon reportedly wrote a letter thanking Chow for helping the sunglasses sell out in the region. The film's director John Woo has acknowledged Delon as one of his idols and wrote a short essay on Le Samourai as well as Le Cercle Rouge for the Criterion Collection DVD releases. In 2009 and 2015, Christian Dior used images of the young Alain Delon and excerpts of his 1960s films The Swimming Pool and The Last Adventure respectively in the Eau Sauvage cologne advertising campaigns. Personal life Alain Delon filming the aborted Marco Polo in Belgrade, 1962 On 20 March 1959, Delon was engaged to actress Romy Schneider, whom he met when they co-starred in the film Christine (1958). During their relationship, he had an affair with German actress, singer and model Nico. On 11 August 1962, Nico gave birth to a son, (Ari P√§ffgen) \\"Ari\\", fathered by Delon. The child was raised mostly by Delon's mother and stepfather. In December 1963, Schneider and Delon decided to break the engagement. On 13 August 1964, Delon married Nathalie Barth√©l√©my. Their son, Anthony Delon, was born in September. In late 1967, Delon filed for divorce but they continued to live under the same roof. The couple divorced on 14 February 1969. In the mid-1960s Delon had a short relationship with Dalida; the two had been friends since first meeting in Paris in 1955, where they were neighbors in a building located in the Champs- √âlys√©es. In 1968, during the shooting of the film Jeff, Delon met French actress Mireille Darc with whom he started a relationship that lasted until 1982. Later on, he had short relationships with the actress Anne Parillaud, then with Catherine Bleynie, ex-wife of Didier Pironi. In 1987, Delon met Dutch model on the set of the music video for his song \\"Comme au cin√©ma\\" and started a relationship. They had two children: Anouchka Delon (25 November 1990) and Alain-Fabien Delon (18 March 1994). The relationship ended in 2001. Delon lives in Ch√™ne-Bougeries in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland and Douchy, Loiret, France. During an interview in 2013, Delon came out in support of the French far-right political party National Front, saying \\"The National Front, like the MCG [Geneva Citizens' Movement] in Geneva, is very important...I encourage it and I perfectly understand it\\". Alain Delon was good friends with, among others, Argentine world champion boxer Carlos Monzon.http://www.laopinion.com/boxeo/Carlos-Monzon-mito-boxeo-argentine In September 2019, Ari Boulogne (Christian Aaron Boulogne) sued Alain Delon for recognition of paternity. Markovic affair On 1 October 1968, in the village of √âlancourt, Yvelines, on the western outskirts of Paris, the body of Stevan Markoviƒá, ex-bodyguard of Delon, was found in a public dump. Alain Delon and a Corsican gangster Fran√ßois Marcantoni came under investigation. One of the factors pointing in that direction was a letter from Stevan Markoviƒá to his brother Aleksandar, in which he wrote: \\"If I get killed, it's 100% the fault of Alain Delon and his godfather Francois Marcantoni.\\" Later, the investigation involved the former French Prime Minister (and later President) Georges Pompidou after a few press articles and a testimony of Borivoj Ackov. He testified that he was present at parties with Pompidou's wife, Markoviƒá and Delon. The death of Stevan Markoviƒá provoked a lot of rumours, suggesting the existence of group sex photos with Pompidou's wife. Pompidou himself accused Louis Wallon and Henri Capitant for using the French espionage service SDECE with an aim to set him up. After becoming President of the Republic, he named Alexandre de Marenches as the head of the SDECE in order to reform it. Assisted by Michel Roussin, his principal private secretary, de Marenches expelled a \\"secret agent\\" involved in the investigation of Jean-Charles Marchiani.Markovic affair Other legal troubles In 1969, Delon was sentenced to four months in jail by an Italian court for assaulting an Italian photographer. De Gaulle document In 1970, it was reported that Delon, through a friend, Mr Stan, purchased a copy of the original manuscript of Charles de Gaulle's 1940 speech to the French encouraging them to resist the Germans. Delon paid 300,000 francs for the manuscript and then returned it to the government. Health Delon suffered a stroke in June 2019. He was admitted to hospital after experiencing dizziness and headaches. In August 2019, he was recovering in a Swiss hospital. Influences Delon's favourite actor is John Garfield. He also admires Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando and Robert Walker.

She was the daughter of Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger and Livia, thus the half-sister of Cato the Younger. She married Marcus Junius Brutus the Elder. They had a son, Brutus the Younger. After her first husband's death she married Decimus Junius Silanus, and had a son with him, as well as three daughters. She gained fame as the mistress of Julius Caesar, whom her son Brutus and son-in-law Gaius Cassius Longinus, would assassinate in 44 BC. The relationship between Caesar and her seems to have been well known in Rome at the time and imperial historians characterized her as \\"the love of his life\\",Tom Holland; Doubleday, 2003.

Biography Early life Servilia was a patrician who could trace her line back to Gaius Servilius Ahala,Plut. Bru. 1,5. and was the eldest child of Livia and Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger. Her parents had two other children, a younger Servilia and a Gnaeus Servilius Caepio, her father also likely had another son named Quintus Servilius Caepio from an earlier marriage. They divorced when she was young (c. 97 BC), and her mother then married Marcus Porcius Cato. From this union, Servilia's half-brother, Cato, and half-sister, Porcia, were born. However, her mother and stepfather both died before 91 BC. As a result, Servilia, her younger siblings, and her half- siblings were all brought up in the house of their maternal uncle, Marcus Livius Drusus. He was assassinated during his tribunate in 91 BC, when Servilia would have been around 13 years of age. After the death of her mother and father, Servilia became legally independent and gained a considerable estate Servilia had great influence on her half-brother Cato the Younger. He was considered to be tough and wild as a child, which frames Servilia as his equal in those respects. As a young girl belonging to Roman ruling class, Servilia would have been well educated. She likely would have been taught to read, write, sing, dance, and play an instrument. She would have read poetry, epics, and histories. Marriages and children Servilia was married to Marcus Junius Brutus (c. 76 BC), tribune of the plebs and founder of a colony at Capua. They had one child, Marcus Junius Brutus, born about 85 BC. This was a profitable marriage for Brutus, who would gain fortune, stability, and political traction through Servilia. The elder Brutus was killed by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus after the surrender of Mutina in 77 BC.Plut. Pomp. 16Appian, B. C. ii. IllLiv. Epit 90. After the death of the elder Brutus, Servilia's bond with her son grew. Servilia subsequently married Decimus Junius Silanus, by whom she had one son Marcus Junius Silanus and three daughters: Junia Prima, Junia Secunda, and Junia Tertia. Her daughters were all married into prominent and politically active families. Junia Prima was married to Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus. Junia Secunda was married to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Junia Tertia was married to Gaius Cassius Longinus. Servilia was well connected and facilitated these advantageous marriages herself. It is speculated that either soon after she married Silanus, or after the births of her daughters, Servilia's notorious affair with Caesar began. Silanus is not depicted to have been against the affair. Servilia did not remarry after the death of Silanus in 57 BC, and remained unmarried for the rest of her life.  Political involvement  Servilia worked extensively in 44 BC to ensure the safety of her family both attending senate meetings, and by contributing greatly to the discourses during their meetings. Cicero's letters detail other meetings of senate that Servilia had called to discuss what actions should be taken which would protect her son and sons-in-law. Cicero described her as a 'nervous lady', which could be understood as politically cautious. Servilia's opinions were often held in higher esteem than those of Cicero during meetings with Brutus and other key members of the uprising. Due to women being unable to hold office or vote Servilia focused her political efforts on strategic marriages for her daughters and helping create her political career for her son Brutus. In the aftermath of Caesar's assassination, the senate sought to send Cassius and Brutus to oversee grain commissions outside of Rome. Brutus was to go to Asia, but was reluctant to do so. The senatorial decree was, however, dropped, and Cicero claims that it was because of some action by Servilia. During Brutus's exile, he was still the Urban Praetor. It is recorded that during his absence Servilia and Titus Pomponius Atticus took over his duties, with Servilia acting, essentially, as Brutus's substitute. During this time, Servilia organized the games in honour of Apollo. She was in charge of decisions concerning the ceremony, finances, and senatorial contacts. Servilia led a council meeting to discuss the possible return of Brutus and Cassius from exile, which serves as the most explicit depiction of a woman overseeing a meeting in this period. Relationship with Caesar Caesar had numerous affairs with women married and unmarried, but none lasted as long, nor were they as passionate as his affair with Servilia. Their affair is speculated to have begun circa 70 BC, after the execution of her first husband, M. Junius Brutus, and continued until the death of Caesar. The affair was well known, and Servilia suffered no damage to her reputation because of this relationship, in fact it likely improved. Plutarch only emphasized Servilia's devotion for Caesar, claiming that she was madly in love with him, however it is widely accepted that Caesar held a deep affection for Servilia. Scholars speculate that it was Caesar's affections which allowed the affair to continue for as long as it did. A popular rumor during their affair was that Servilia was prostituting her daughter to Caesar or that Tertia was Caesar's own illegitimate child. At an estate auction where Caesar received several properties at a low rate to give to Servilia, Cicero remarked, \\"It's a better bargain than you think, for there is a third (tertia) off,\\" alluding to the rumours regarding Tertia. A similar rumour held that Servilia's son, Marcus Junius Brutus, was Caesar's son,Plut, Bru., 5.2. but this is unlikely on chronological grounds, as Caesar was only fifteen years old when Brutus was born. In 63 BC, Servilia contributed to a scandalous incident during a debate in the senate over the fate of those who had conspired with Catiline. Caesar and Cato, Servilia's half-brother, were on opposing sides in the debate, and when someone handed Caesar a letter, Cato accused him of corresponding with the conspirators, and demanded it be read aloud. The missive proved to be a love letter from Servilia.Plut. Cato. 24,1 Cato was greatly displeased to find out about Caesar's correspondence with his half-sister. Modern scholars have made use of this incident to indicate the passion between Servilia and Caesar, noting that Servilia maintained long-distance contact while Caesar was away. Servilia's loyalties were torn during the Civil War, as both Cato and Brutus espoused the side of Pompeius, despite the latter's role in the death of the elder Brutus. Perhaps out of a desire to avoid offending Servilia, Caesar gave orders that Brutus should not be harmed if encountered after the Pompeian defeat at Pharsalus.Plutarch, Life of Brutus, 5.1. Brutus's actions during her later life A rift developed between Servilia and her son in 45 BC, when Brutus unexpectedly, and some thought unreasonably, divorced Claudia Pulchra, in order to marry his cousin, Porcia, the daughter of Cato.Cic. Att. 13. 16 Servilia seems to have worried that Porcia would exert too strong an influence on her son, and she may well have been jealous of the affection that Brutus showed his new bride.Cic. Att. 13. 22 After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, in a conspiracy headed by Servilia's son and son-in-law, the conspirators met at Servilia's house. Apart from Servilia, the only women in attendance were Porcia and Junia Tertia. Despite her connections with the conspirators, Servilia escaped the purges of the second triumvirate unscathed, probably due to the fact that she was Lepidus' mother-in-law. After Brutus' death, her son's ashes were sent to her from Philippi. Servilia lived out the remainder of her life in relative comfort and affluence under the care of her friend, Atticus.  Later life  Very little is known about Servilia's life after the death of Brutus. She is suspected to have died a natural death between 27 and 23 BC.

Cultural depictions Literature Servilia is the subject of a poem by John Dryden. A fictionalized Servilia appears in the Emperor series of novels by Conn Iggulden, who has portrayed her as a courtesan. Servilia is a character in Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series. Television and film A fictionalised version of Servilia was a main character in the 2005 HBO television series Rome, played by Lindsay Duncan.

The latest date for Cornelia's marriage to young Crassus would be 54 BC, before he left to join his father for the ill-fated Parthian campaign; Cornelia is unlikely to have been younger than 15 at the time, and so her latest year of birth would be 69 BC. See Syme, ‚ÄúThe Sons of Crassus,‚Äù Latomus 39 (1980) 403-408, reprinted in Roman Papers (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), vol. 3, p. 1225. was the daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica (who was a consul in 52 BC and originally from the gens Cornelia). She appears in numerous literary sources, including an official dedicatory inscription at Pergamon.Greek inscription translated into Latin as Cornelia Q. Metelli Pii Scipionis filia. Despite her father's testamentary \\"adoption\\" by Metellus Pius, Cornelia is never called Caecilia Metella in any extant sources. M√ºnzer supposed that she retained the gens Cornelia name because she was born before her father's adoption, which was a legal formality. Discussed by Jerzy Linderski, \\"Q. Scipio Imperator,\\" in Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 150 online. Biography Plutarch describes her as a beautiful woman of good character, well read and a skilled player of the lyre. She was also very well educated in geometry and philosophy. Cornelia was first married to Publius Licinius Crassus, son of Marcus Licinius Crassus, in 55 or 54 BC, when he returned to Rome after serving under Julius Caesar in Gaul. After her first husband's death at the Battle of Carrhae, Cornelia became the fifth wife of Pompey in 52 BC. She was a faithful follower of Pompey and met him in Mytilene with his son Sextus Pompeius, after the battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Together, they fled to Egypt where Pompey was murdered. On his arrival, Caesar punished the murderers of Pompey and gave Cornelia his ashes and signet ring. She returned to Rome and spent the rest of her life in Pompey's estates in Italy. Cultural references Cornelia appears in George Frideric Handel's 1724 opera Giulio Cesare in Egitto (\\"Julius Caesar in Egypt\\"), where she pleads with Caesar to spare her husband; he is about to grant her plea, but Pompey was already killed by the Egyptians. She is the title and main character in Robert Garnier's play Corn√©lie and its English language adaptation Cornelia by Thomas Kyd. In the first season of the TV series Rome, broadcast in 2005, Cornelia is portrayed by actress Anna Patrick. Unlike the historic Cornelia, this portrayal sees her as middle aged, and already having two children, presumably by her deceased husband Publius Crassus.

He was usually billed in English- speaking films as Curt Jurgens. He was well known for playing Ernst Udet in Des Teufels General. His best known English-language roles were as Wehrmacht general G√ºnther Blumentritt in The Longest Day and as James Bond villain Karl Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me. Early life J√ºrgens was born on 13 December 1915 in the Munich borough of Solln, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire. His father, Kurt, was a trader from Hamburg, and his mother, Marie- Albertine, was a French teacher.\\"Curt Jurgens, War Films' Star\\" (Free Preview) The New York Times \\"The Man You'll Love to Hate\\" (Free Preview) The New York Times He began his working career as a journalist before becoming an actor at the urging of his actress wife, Louise Basler. He spent much of his early acting career on the stage in Vienna. J√ºrgens was critical of National Socialism in his native Germany. In 1944, he was sent to an internment camp in Hungary as a \\"political unreliable\\". J√ºrgens became an Austrian citizen after the war. Career J√ºrgens went on to play soldiers in many war films. Notable performances in this vein include his breakthrough screen role in Des Teufels General (1955, The Devil's General), a fictional portrayal of World War I flying ace and World War II Luftwaffe general Ernst Udet, followed by Roger Vadim's film Et Dieu... cr√©a la femme (And God Created Woman) starring Brigitte Bardot. J√ºrgens' first Hollywood film was The Enemy Below (1957), in which he portrayed a German U-boat commander. In 1962, he played the German general G√ºnther Blumentritt in The Longest Day (1962). Later, in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), he played the villain Karl Stromberg, a sociopathic industrialist seeking to transform the world into an ocean paradise. His last film appearance was as Ma√Ætre Legraine, beside Alain Delon and Claude Jade in the spy-thriller Teheran 43 (1981). In English-language television, he played Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in several episodes of the BBC series Fall of Eagles (1974) and appeared as General Vladimir in the BBC's Smiley's People (1982).

He was member of several theatres in Vienna (Volkstheater 1938‚Äì1941, Burgtheater 1940‚Äì1953 and 1965‚Äì1968, and others). He played the title role of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's play Jedermann at the Salzburg Festival from 1973 until 1977 ‚Äì arguably the most high-profile role for a German-speaking male actor.

Freeborn women in ancient Rome were citizens (cives),The form of Roman marriage called conubium, for instance, requires that both spouses be citizens; like men from towns granted civitas sine suffragio, women (at least those eligible for conubium) were citizens without suffrage. The legal status of a mother as a citizen affected her son's citizenship. All Roman citizens recognized as such by law did not hold equal rights and privileges, particularly in regard to holding high office. See A Casebook on Roman Family Law following, and A.N. Sherwin- White, Roman Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268 online (on male citizenship as it relates to marrying citizen women) et passim. (\\"children born of two Roman citizens\\") indicates that a Roman woman was regarded as having citizen status, in specific contrast to a peregrina. but could not vote or hold political office.Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, A Casebook on Roman Family Law (Oxford University Press: American Philological Association, 2004), pp. 31‚Äì32, 457, et passim. Because of their limited public role, women are named less frequently than men by Roman historians. But while Roman women held no direct political power, those from wealthy or powerful families could and did exert influence through private negotiations.Kristina Milnor, \\"Women in Roman Historiography,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Historians (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 278; Ann Ellis Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology at Rome,\\" in Les √©coles m√©dicales √† Rome: Actes du 2√®me Colloque international sur les textes m√©dicaux latins antiques, Lausanne, septembre 1986 (Universit√© de Nantes, 1991), p. 256. Exceptional women who left an undeniable mark on history range from Lucretia and Claudia Quinta, whose stories took on mythic significance; fierce Republican-era women such as Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, and Fulvia, who commanded an army and issued coins bearing her image; women of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, most prominently Livia (58 BC-AD 29) and Agrippina the Younger (15 AD-59 AD), who contributed to the formation of Imperial mores; and the empress Helena (250‚Äì330 AD), a driving force in promoting Christianity.Unless otherwise noted, this introductory overview is based on Beryl Rawson, \\"Finding Roman Women,\\" in A Companion to the Roman Republic (Blackwell, 2010), p. 325. As is the case with male members of society, elite women and their politically significant deeds eclipse those of lower status in the historical record. Inscriptions and especially epitaphs document the names of a wide range of women throughout the Roman Empire, but often tell little else about them. Some vivid snapshots of daily life are preserved in Latin literary genres such as comedy, satire, and poetry, particularly the poems of Catullus and Ovid, which offer glimpses of women in Roman dining rooms and boudoirs, at sporting and theatrical events, shopping, putting on makeup, practicing magic, worrying about pregnancy ‚Äî all, however, through male eyes.Kelly Olson, \\"The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl,\\" in Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 139. The published letters of Cicero, for instance, reveal informally how the self-proclaimed great man interacted on the domestic front with his wife Terentia and daughter Tullia, as his speeches demonstrate through disparagement the various ways Roman women could enjoy a free-spirited sexual and social life.In reference to his character assassination of the notorious Clodia; see Pro Caelio. The one major public role reserved solely for women was in the sphere of religion: the priestly office of the Vestals. Forbidden from marriage or sex for a period of thirty years, the Vestals devoted themselves to the study and correct observance of rituals which were deemed necessary for the security and survival of Rome but which could not be performed by the male colleges of priests.For an extensive modern consideration of the Vestals, see Ariadne Staples, From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion (Routledge, 1998). Childhood and education Roman girls playing a game Childhood and upbringing in ancient Rome were determined by social status. Roman children played a number of games, and their toys are known from archaeology and literary sources. Animal figures were popular, and some children kept live animals and birds as pets.Beryl Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy (Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 129‚Äì130. In Roman art, girls are shown playing many of the same games as boys, such as ball, hoop-rolling, and knucklebones. Dolls are sometimes found in the tombs of those who died before adulthood. The figures are typically 15‚Äì16 cm tall, with jointed limbs, and made of materials such as wood, terracotta, and especially bone and ivory. Girls coming of age dedicated their dolls to Diana, the goddess most concerned with girlhood, or to Venus when they were preparing for marriage.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 128, citing Persius 2.70 and the related scholion, and p. 48 on Diana. Rome lacked the elaborate puberty rites for girls that were practiced in ancient Greece (p. 145). Noble girls were known to marry as young as 12 years of age,Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family in Italy\\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 21. whereas females in the lower classes were more likely to marry slightly further into their teenage years.Judith P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142.Lauren, Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2014), pp. 3‚Äì4. An example of the marriage age of noble females can be seen with Cicero's lifelong friend Atticus, who married his daughter Caecilia Attica to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa when she was 14. Bronze statuette of the 1st century depicting a girl reading Girls were expected to safeguard their chastity, modesty and reputation, in preparation for eventual marriage.Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\", p. 16. The light regulation of marriage by the law with regards to minimum age (12) and consent to marriage was designed to leave families, primarily fathers, with much freedom to propel girls into marriage whenever and with whomever they saw fit. Marriage facilitated a partnership between the father and prospective husbands, and enabled the formation of a mutually beneficial alliance with both political and economic incentives at heart.Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\", pp. 106‚Äì107. The social regime, geared towards early marriage and implemented through children's education and upbringing, was particularly restrictive for girls. Some, perhaps many, girls went to a public primary school, however there is some evidence to suggest that girls‚Äô education was limited to this elementary school level. It has been inferred that individual school tutoring of girls at home was led by concerns about threats to girls‚Äô modesty in coeducational classrooms.Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\", p. 18. Ovid and Martial imply that boys and girls were educated either together or similarly, and Livy takes it for granted that the daughter of a centurion would be in school.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, pp. 197‚Äì198 However many other historians and philosophers, such as Epictetus, suggest that the educational system, particularly rhetorical training, was preoccupied with the development of masculine virtue; with male teenagers performing school exercises in public speaking about Roman values.Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\", p. 17. Children of both genders learned to behave socially by attending dinner parties or other, less elitist events. Both genders participated in religious festivals; for example, at the Secular Games of 17 BC, the Carmen Saeculare was sung by a choir of girls and boys.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 198. Children were made into virtuous adults through scholastic means, with curriculum, language, literature, and philosophy teaching moral precepts. Children of the elite were taught Greek as well as Latin from an early age.Janine Assa, The Great Roman Ladies (New York, 1960), p. 50. Among the upper classes, women seem to have been well-educated, some highly so, and were sometimes praised by the male historians for their learning and cultivation.Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" in The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives (Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 30, 40‚Äì41. Some women became socially prominent, and even relatively independent.Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\", p. 2. Cornelia Metella, the young wife of Pompey the Great at the time of his death, was distinguished for her musicianship and her knowledge of geometry, literature, and philosophy.Plutarch, Life of Pompey 55 LacusCurtius edition. This degree of learning indicates formal preparation, however among the lower classes education was limited and strongly geared towards the course of marriage, and performing the tasks of the female within the household.Sandra R. Joshel, Sheila Murnaghan, \\"Women and Slaves in Greco-Roman Culture\\" (Routledge; New edition 2001), p. 86. Elite families poured money into their daughters literary and virtue training to equip them with skills that would appeal to prospective husbands. Epictetus suggests that at the age of 14, girls were considered to be on the brink of womanhood, and beginning to understand the inevitability of their future role as wives. They learned modesty through explicit instruction and upbringing.Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\", pp. 15‚Äì16. The lives of boys and girls began to diverge dramatically after they formally came of age,Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" p. 40. and memorials to women recognize their domestic qualities far more often than intellectual achievements.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 45. The skills a Roman matron needed to run a household required training, and mothers probably passed on their knowledge to their daughters in a manner appropriate to their station in life, given the emphasis in Roman society on traditionalism.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 197. Virginity and sexual purity was a culturally valued quality, and considered vital for the stability of both family and state. The rape of an unmarried girl posed a threat to her reputation and marriageability, and the penalty of death was sometimes imposed on the unchaste daughter.Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\", pp. 11, 45‚Äì46. The Emperor Augustus introduced marriage legislation, the Lex Papia Poppaea, which rewarded marriage and childbearing. The legislation also imposed penalties on young persons who failed to marry and on those who committed adultery. Therefore, marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty- five and sixty for men, and twenty and fifty for women.Mary T. Boatwright, Daniel J. Gargola, Noel Lenski, Richard J. A. Talbert, \\"A Brief History of The Romans\\" (Oxford University Press; 2 edition, 2013), p. 176. Women in the family and law Always a daughter Both daughters and sons were subject to patria potestas, the power wielded by their father as head of household (familia). A Roman household was considered a collective (corpus, a \\"body\\") over which the pater familias had mastery (dominium). Slaves, who had no legal standing, were part of the household as property. In the early Empire, the legal standing of daughters differed little if at all from that of sons.Frier, A Casebook on Roman Family Law, pp. 19‚Äì20. If the father died without a will, the right of a daughter to share in the family property was equal to that of a son, though legislation in the 2nd century BCE had attempted to limit this right. Even apart from legal status, daughters seem no less esteemed within the Roman family than sons, though sons were expected to ensure family standing by following their fathers into public life.Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" in The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 18. Bust of a Roman girl, early 3rd century The pater familias had the right and duty to find a husband for his daughter,Frier, A Casebook on Roman Family Law, p. 66. and first marriages were normally arranged. Technically, the couple had to be old enough to consent, but the age of consent was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, though in practice boys seem to have been on average five years older. Among the elite, 14 was the age of transition from childhood to adolescence,J.A. Crook, Law and Life of Rome 90B.C.-212 A.D. but a betrothal might be arranged for political reasons when the couple were too young to marry, and in general noble women married younger than women of the lower classes. Most Roman women would have married in their late teens to early twenties. An aristocratic girl was expected to be a virgin when she married, as her young age might indicate.Judith P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142. A daughter could legitimately refuse a match made by her parents only by showing that the proposed husband was of bad character.Rawson, \\"The Roman Family\\", p. 21. In the early Republic, the bride became subject to her husband's potestas, but to a lesser degree than their children.Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, A Casebook on Roman Family Law (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 20. By the early Empire, however, a daughter's legal relationship to her father remained unchanged when she married, even though she moved into her husband's home.Frier and McGinn, Casebook, pp. 19‚Äì20. This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the early modern period: although she had to answer to her father legally, she didn't conduct her daily life under his direct scrutiny,\\"If adults sons or daughters and their children had lived in the same household as the paterfamilias,\\" notes Rawson, \\"they may well have found the constant awareness of his powers and position a great strain\\" (\\"The Roman Family,\\" p. 15). and her husband had no legal power over her. A daughter was expected to be deferential toward her father and to remain loyal to him, even if it meant having to differ with her husbands.Hallett, 139. \\"Deference\\" was not always absolute. After arranging his daughter's first two marriages, Cicero disapproved ‚Äî rightly, as it turned out ‚Äî of her choice to marry the unreliable Dolabella, but found himself unable to prevent it.Rawson, The Roman Family, p. 21. A daughter kept her own family name (nomen) for life, not assuming that of her husband. Children usually took the father's name. In the Imperial period, however, children might sometimes make their mother's family name part of theirs, or even adopt it instead.Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" p. 18.  Women and sexuality  From the start of the Roman republic, there was a high emphasis placed on a woman's virginity. Pudicitia (chastity) was a goddess of feminine purity, and was worshipped by Roman women. Only those who were virgins were allowed to enter the temple. A woman's sexual life began with the consummation of her marriage in her husband's cubiculum, or private room where slaves did not enter. In Roman houses it was common for men and women to each have their own cubicula, allowing potential for them to engage in sex lives separate from each other. While it was expected that women should only have sexual relations with their husbands, it was common for men to have many sexual partners throughout his life. After marriage, women were scrutinized in the household to prevent any adulterous behavior. For example, Julius Caesar's second wife, Pompeia, highlights this point well as she attempted to have private relations with Publius Clodius. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, monitored Pompeia's actions and prevented their private meetings. The mere possibility of Pompeia committing adultery caused Caesar to divorce her.  Augustus's campaign on women and the family  The obsession with a woman's purity, and her role as a faithful wife and dutiful mother in the family increased during the reign of Augustus. This general campaign to improve family dynamics began in 18‚Äì17 BC. Augustus' new laws targeted both men and women between the ages of 20-55, who were rewarded for being in healthy relationships, and punished if not married and without children. Additionally, Augustus enforced the divorce and punishment of adulterous wives. Women under his rule could be punished in the courts for adultery and banished. This shifted a woman's body and relationships from being private, to become a public matter that could be regulated. Therefore, the palace was secured and driven by this idea that women would be returned to their proper places as chaste wives and mothers, and thus household order would be restored. Augustus went so far as to punish and exile his own daughter, Julia, for engaging in extramarital affairs. Women and the law Although the rights and status of women in the earliest period of Roman history were more restricted than in the late Republic and Empire, as early as the 5th century BC, Roman women could own land, write their own wills, and appear in court. The historian Valerius Maximus devotes a section of his work On Memorable Deeds and Speeches to women who conducted cases on their own behalf, or on behalf of others.Richard A. Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50. These women got to show their ability as orators in the courtroom at a time when oratory was considered a defining pursuit of the most ambitious Roman men. One of these, Maesia Sentinas,Her name appears also as Amesia. is identified by her origin in the town of Sentinum, and not, as was customary, by her relation to a man. The independent Maesia spoke in her own defense, and was acquitted almost unanimously after only a short trial because she spoke with such strength and effectiveness. Since these characteristics were considered masculine, however, the historian opined that under her feminine appearance, she had a \\"virile spirit,\\" and thereafter she was called \\"the Androgyne.\\"Valerius Maximus 8.3.1; Joseph Farrell, Latin Language and Latin Culture (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74‚Äì75; Michael C. Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149‚Äì50 BCE (University of Toronto Press, 1990), p. 180. Alexander places the date of the trial, about which Valerius is unclear, to sometime between 80 and 50 BCE. The charge goes unrecorded. Roman fresco of a blonde maiden reading a text, Pompeian Fourth Style (60‚Äì79 AD), Pompeii, Italy Maesia's ability to present a case \\"methodically and vigorously\\" suggests that while women didn't plead regularly in open court, they had experience in private declamation and family court.Bauman, Women and Politics, p. 50. Afrania,The name is vexed; it may also be Carfrania. the wife of a senator during the time of Sulla, appeared so frequently before the praetor who presided over the court, even though she had male advocates who could have spoken for her, that she was accused of calumnia, malicious prosecution. An edict was consequently enacted that prohibited women from bringing claims on behalf of others, on the grounds that it jeopardized their pudicitia, the modesty appropriate to one's station.Bauman, Women and Politics, pp. 50‚Äì51. It has been notedBauman, Women and Politics, p. 51. that while women were often impugned for their feeblemindedness and ignorance of the law, and thus in need of protection by male advocates, in reality actions were taken to restrict their influence and effectiveness. Despite this specific restriction, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters in the Late Republic and Principate, including dictating legal strategy to their advocate behind the scenes.Bauman, Women and Politics, pp. 51‚Äì52. An emancipated woman legally became sui iuris, or her own person, and could own property and dispose of it as she saw fit. If a pater familias died intestate, the law required the equal division of his estate amongst his children, regardless of their age and sex. A will that did otherwise, or emancipated any family member without due process of law, could be challenged.Johnston, Roman Law in Context, chapter 3.3; Frier and McGinn, Casebook, Chapter IV. From the late Republic onward, a woman who inherited a share equal with her brothers would have been independent of agnatic control.Yan Thomas, \\"The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law,\\" in A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 134. As in the case of minors, an emancipated woman had a legal guardian (tutor) appointed to her. She retained her powers of administration, however, and the guardian's main if not sole purpose was to give formal consent to actions.Alan Watson, The Spirit of Roman Law (University of Georgia Press, 1995), p. 13; Thomas, \\"The Division of the Sexes,\\" p. 135. The guardian had no say in her private life, and a woman sui iuris could marry as she pleased.Judith Evans Grubbs, Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: A Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Law in the Roman Empire (Routledge, 2002) , p. 24. A woman also had certain avenues of recourse if she wished to replace an obstructive tutor.Watson, The Spirit of Roman Law, p. 13; Gaius, Inst. 1.173. Under Augustus, a woman who had gained the ius liberorum, the legal right to certain privileges after bearing three children, was also released from guardianship,Thomas, \\"The Division of the Sexes,\\" p. 133. and the emperor Claudius banned agnatic guardianship. The role of guardianship as a legal institution gradually diminished, and by the 2nd century CE the jurist Gaius said he saw no reason for it.Gaius, Institutes 1.190‚Äì1.191. The Christianization of the Empire, beginning with the conversion of the Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century, eventually had consequences for the legal status of women. Marriage Festus 55 (edition of Lindsay); Karen K. Hersch, The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211 . 4th century sarcophagus Family tomb inscriptions of respectable Romans suggest that the ideal Roman marriage was one of mutual loyalty, in which husband and wife shared interests, activities, and property.Wiesner, Merry E. ‚ÄúThe Family‚Äù Gender in History: Global Perspectives, 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2011, p.32 In the earliest period of the Roman Republic, a bride passed from her father's control into the \\"hand\\" (manus) of her husband. She then became subject to her husband's potestas, though to a lesser degree than their children.Frier and McGinn, A Casebook on Roman Family Law, p. 20. In the earliest periods of Roman history, Manus Marriage meant that a married woman would be subjugated by her husband, but that custom had died out by the 1st century BCE, in favor of Free Marriage which did not grant a husband any rights over his wife or have any changing effect on a woman's status.Duby,Perrot,and Pantel A History of Women Volume 1, pg. 133 During the classical era of Roman law, marriage required no ceremony, but only a mutual will and agreement to live together in harmony. Marriage ceremonies, contracts, and other formalities were meant only to prove that a couple had, in fact, married. Under early or archaic Roman law, marriages were of three kinds: confarreatio, symbolized by the sharing of bread (panis farreus); coemptio, \\"by purchase\\"; and usus, by mutual cohabitation. Patricians always married by confarreatio, while plebeians married by the latter two kinds. In marriage by usus, if a woman was absent for three consecutive nights at least once a year, she would avoid her husband establishing legal control over her. This differed from the Athenian custom of arranged marriage and sequestered wives who were not supposed to walk in the street unescorted. The form of marriage known as manus was the norm in the early Republic, but became less frequent thereafter.The late Imperial Roman jurist Gaius writes of manus marriage as something that used to happen. Frier and McGinn, Casebook, p. 54. Under this early form of marriage, the bride passed into the \\"hand\\" (manus) of her husband; that is, she was transferred from the potestas of her father to that of her husband. Her dowry, any inheritance rights transferred through her marriage, and any property acquired by her after marriage belonged to him. Husbands could divorce on grounds of adultery, and a few cases of divorce for a wife's infertility are recorded.Frier and McGinn, Casebook, p. 53. Manus marriage was an unequal relationship; it changed a woman‚Äôs intestate heirs from her siblings to her children, not because she was their mother, but because in law her position was the same as that of a daughter to her husband. Under manus, women were expected to obey their husbands in almost all aspects of their lives. This archaic form of manus marriage was largely abandoned by the time of Julius Caesar, when a woman remained under her father's authority by law even when she moved into her husband's home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:Eva Cantarella, Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140‚Äì141; J.P. Sullivan, \\"Martial's Sexual Attitudes\\", Philologus 123 (1979), p. 296, specifically on sexual freedom. So- called \\"free\\" marriage caused no change in personal status for either the wife or the husband.David Johnston, Roman Law in Context (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 33‚Äì34. Free marriage usually involved two citizens, or a citizen and a person who held Latin rights, and in the later Imperial period and with official permission, soldier-citizens and non-citizens. In a free marriage a bride brought a dowry to the husband: if the marriage ended with no cause of adultery he returned most of it.Johnston, Roman Law, pp. 36‚Äì36; Frier and McGinn, Casebook, section V. So total was the law's separation of property that gifts between spouses were not recognized as such; if a couple divorced or even lived apart, the giver could reclaim the gift.Frier and McGinn, Casebook, pp. 49, 52, citing Ulpian, D. 24.1.3.1. If the donor died first, however, the gift to the surviving spouse was valid. Divorce Fresco of a seated woman from Stabiae, 1st century AD Divorce was a legal but relatively informal affair which mainly involved a wife leaving her husband‚Äôs house and taking back her dowry. According to the historian Valerius Maximus, divorces were taking place by 604 BCE or earlier, and the law code as embodied in the mid-5th century BCE by the Twelve Tables provides for divorce. Divorce was socially acceptable if carried out within social norms (mos maiorum). By the time of Cicero and Julius Caesar, divorce was relatively common and \\"shame- free,\\" the subject of gossip rather than a social disgrace.Suzanne Dixon, \\"From Ceremonial to Sexualities: A Survey of Scholarship on Roman Marriage\\" in A Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), p. 248. Valerius says that Lucius Annius was disapproved of because he divorced his wife without consulting his friends; that is, he undertook the action for his own purposes and without considering its effects on his social network (amicitia and clientela). The censors of 307 BCE thus expelled him from the Senate for moral turpitude. Elsewhere, however, it is claimed that the first divorce took place only in 230 BCE, at which time Dionysius of Halicarnassus notesDionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiquitates Romanae, 2.25 that \\"Spurius Carvilius, a man of distinction, was the first to divorce his wife\\" on grounds of infertility. This was most likely the Spurius Carvilius Maximus Ruga who was consul in 234 and 228 BCE. The evidence is confused.Aulus Gellius (Noctes Atticae 4.3.1) places the divorce in 227 BCE, but fudges the date and his sources elsewhere. During the classical period of Roman law (late Republic and Principate), a man or womanAlan Watson, The Spirit of Roman Law (University of Georgia Press, 1995), p. 173. could end a marriage simply because he or she wanted to, and for no other reason. Unless the wife could prove the spouse was worthless, he kept the children. Because property had been kept separate during the marriage, divorce from a \\"free\\" marriage was a very easy procedure.Frier and McGinn, Casebook, part D, \\"The End of Marriage.\\" Remarriage Heracles and Omphale, Roman fresco, Pompeian Fourth Style (45‚Äì79 AD), Naples National Archaeological Museum, Italy The frequency of remarriage among the elite was high. Speedy remarriage was not unusual, and perhaps even customary, for aristocratic Romans after the death of a spouse.Susan Treggiari, Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258‚Äì259, 500‚Äì502 et passim. While no formal waiting period was dictated for a widower, it was customary for a woman to remain in mourning for ten months before remarrying.Karen K. Hersch, The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity, p. 48. The duration may allow for pregnancy: if a woman had become pregnant just before her husband's death, the period of ten months ensures that no question of paternity, which might affect the child's social status and inheritance, would attach to the birth.In Roman inclusive counting, a pregnancy was counted as lasting ten months. No law prohibited pregnant women from marrying, and there are well-known instances: Augustus married Livia when she was carrying her former husband's child, and the College of Pontiffs ruled that it was permissible as long as the child's father was determined first. Livia's previous husband even attended the wedding.Eva Cantarella, \\"Marriage and Sexuality in Republican Rome: A Roman Conjugal Love Story,\\" in The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 276. Because elite marriages often occurred for reasons of politics or property, a widow or divorc√©e with assets in these areas faced few obstacles to remarrying. She was far more likely to be legally emancipated than a first-time bride, and to have a say in the choice of husband. The marriages of Fulvia, who commanded troops during the last civil war of the Republic and who was the first Roman woman to have her face on a coin, are thought to indicate her own political sympathies and ambitions: she was married first to the popularist champion Clodius Pulcher, who was murdered in the street after a long feud with Cicero; then to Scribonius Curio, a figure of less ideological certitude who at the time of his death had come over to Julius Caesar; and finally to Mark Antony, the last opponent to the republican oligarchs and to Rome's future first emperor. The Greek observer Plutarch indicates that a second wedding among Romans was likely to be a quieter affair, as a widow would still feel the absence of her dead husband, and a divorc√©e ought to feel shame.Plutarch, Roman Questions 105. But while the circumstances of divorce might be shameful or embarrassing, and remaining married to the same person for life was ideal, there was no general disapproval of remarriage; on the contrary, marriage was considered the right and desirable condition of adult life for both men and women.Karen K. Hersh, The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 4, 48, et passim citing Humbert (1971), pp. 1‚Äì11. See also Treggiari, Roman Marriage. Cato the Younger, who presented himself as a paragon modeled after his moral namesake, allowed his pregnant wife Marcia to divorce him and marry Hortensius, declining to offer his young daughter to the 60-year-old orator instead. After the widowed Marcia inherited considerable wealth, Cato married her again, in a ceremony lacking many of the formalities.Hersh, The Roman Wedding, passim, pointing to the fictionalized and possibly satiric account by Lucan. Or some scholars see in this more of an arrangement than marriage proper. Women might be mocked, however, for marrying too often or capriciously, particularly if it could be implied that sexual appetites and vanity were motives.Hersh, The Roman Wedding, pp. 103‚Äì104.  Concubinage  Roman fresco with a banquet scene from the Casa dei Casti Amanti, Pompeii A concubine was defined by Roman law as a woman living in a permanent monogamous relationship with a man not her husband.Frier and McGinn, Casebook, p. 480. There was no dishonor in being a concubine or living with a concubine, and a concubine could become a wife.Frier and McGinn, Casebook, p. 52. Gifts could be exchanged between the partners in concubinage, in contrast to marriage, which maintained a more defined separation of property. Couples usually resorted to concubinage when inequality of social rank was an obstacle to marriage: for instance, a man of senatorial rank, and a woman who was a social inferior, such as a freedwoman or one who had a questionable background of poverty or prostitution.Frier and McGinn, Casebook, p. 50 Two partners who lacked the right to the form of legal marriage known as conubium might enter into concubinage, or even a highborn woman who loved a man of low social status.J.A. Crook Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-212 A.D. Concubinage differed from marriage chiefly in the status of children born from the relationship. Children had their mother's social rank, and not as was customary their father's. Domestic abuse A maenad with a cupid in her arms, fresco, 1st century AD Classical Roman law did not allow any domestic abuse by a husband to his wife,A casebook on Roman Family Law, Frier and McGinn, pg. 95. but as with any other crime, laws against domestic abuse can be assumed to fail to prevent it. Cato the Elder said, according to his biographer Plutarch, \\"that the man who struck his wife or child, laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things. Also that he thought it more praiseworthy to be a good husband than a good senator.\\"Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder 20.2. A man of status during the Roman Republic was expected to behave moderately toward his wife and to define himself as a good husband. Wife beating was sufficient grounds for divorce or other legal action against the husband.Garrett G. Fagan, \\"Violence in Roman Social Relations,\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 487. Domestic abuse enters the historical record mainly when it involves the egregious excesses of the elite. The Emperor Nero was alleged to have had his first wife (and stepsister) Claudia Octavia murdered, after subjecting her to torture and imprisonment. Nero then married his pregnant mistress Poppaea Sabina, whom he kicked to death for criticizing him.Tacitus, Annals XVI.6 Some modern historians believe that Poppaea died from a miscarriage or childbirth, and that the story was exaggerated to vilify Nero. The despised Commodus is supposed also to have killed his wife and his sister.Frank McLynn, Marcus Aurelius: A Life, p. 435. Motherhood Mother nursing an infant in the presence of the father, detail from a young boy's sarcophagus ca. 150 CE Roman wives were expected to bear children, but the women of the aristocracy, accustomed to a degree of independence, showed a growing disinclination to devote themselves to traditional motherhood. By the 1st century CE, most elite women avoided breast-feeding their infants themselves, and hired wet-nurses.Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" p. 30. The practice was not uncommon as early as the 2nd century BCE, when the comic playwright Plautus mentions wet-nurses casually.Plautus, Miles Gloriosus 697. Since a mother's milk was considered best for the baby,As noted by Soranus (1st century AD) in his Gynaecology 2.18. aristocratic women might still choose to breast-feed, unless physical reasons prevented it.Jane F. Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society (Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 242. If a woman chose to forgo nursing her own child she could visit the Columna Lactaria (\\"Milk Column\\"), where poor parents could obtain milk for their infants as charity from wet nurses, and those who could afford it could choose to hire a wet nurse.Lawrence Richardson, \\"A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,\\" (JHU Press, 1992), p. 94. Licinia, the wife of Cato the Elder (d. 149 BCE), is reported to have nursed not only her son, but sometimes the infants of her slaves, to encourage \\"brotherly affection\\" among them.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder 20.3; Christopher Michael McDonough, \\"Carna, Procra and the Strix on the Kalends of June,\\" Transactions of the American Philological Association 127 (1997), p. 322, note 29. By the time of Tacitus (d. 117 CE), breastfeeding by elite matrons was idealized as a practice of the virtuous old days.Tacitus, Dialogus 28, as noted by McDonough, p. 322. The extent to which Roman women might expect their husbands to participate in the rearing of very young children seems to vary and is hard to determine. Family-values traditionalists such as Cato appear to have taken an interest: Cato liked to be present when his wife bathed and swaddled their child.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder 20.2. Large families were not the norm among the elite even by the Late Republic; the family of Clodius Pulcher, who had at least three sisters and two brothers, was considered unusual.W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 33ff. The birth rate among the aristocracy declined to such an extent that the first Roman emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BCE‚Äì14 CE) passed a series of laws intended to increase it, including special honors for women who bore at least three children (the ius trium liberorum).Janine Assa, The Great Roman Ladies (New York, 1960), p. 32; A History of Women in the West from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints, vol. 1, p. 115. Those who were unmarried, divorced, widowed, or barren were prohibited from inheriting property unless named in a will.Jane F. Gardner, Family and Familia in Roman Law and Life (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2004), p. 53. Roman women were not only valued for the number of children that they produced, but also for their part in raising and educating children to become good citizens. To rear children for successful lives, an exemplary Roman mother needed to be well-educated herself.Assa, The Great Roman Ladies, p. 50. One of the Roman women most famous for their strength and influence as a mother was Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi. Julius Caesar, whose father died when he was only a young teen, had a close relationship with his mother, Aurelia, whose political clout was essential in preventing the execution of her 18-year-old son during the proscriptions of Sulla. Daily life Aristocratic women managed a large and complex household. Since wealthy couples often owned multiple homes and country estates with dozens or even hundreds of slaves, some of whom were educated and highly skilled, this responsibility was the equivalent of running a small corporation. In addition to the social and political importance of entertaining guests, clients, and visiting dignitaries from abroad, the husband held his morning business meetings (salutatio) at home.Susan Treggiari, Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian (Oxford University Press, 1991, reprinted 2002), p. 420. The home (domus) was also the center of the family's social identity, with ancestral portraits displayed in the entrance hall (atrium). Since the most ambitious aristocratic men were frequently away from home on military campaign or administrative duty in the provinces, sometimes for years at a time, the maintenance of the family's property and business decisions were often left to the wives; for instance, while Julius Caesar was away from Rome throughout the 50s BCE, his wife Calpurnia was responsible for taking care of his assets. When Ovid, Rome's greatest living poet, was exiled by Augustus in 8 CE, his wife exploited social connections and legal maneuvers to hold on to the family's property, on which their livelihood depended.Hermann Fr√§nkel, Ovid: A Poet between Two Worlds (University of California Press, 1956), p. 151. Ovid expresses his love and admiration for her lavishly in the poetry he wrote during his exile.Jo-Marie Claasen, \\"Tristia,\\" in A Companion to Ovid (Blackwell, 2009), p. 179. Frugality, parsimony, and austerity were characteristics of the virtuous matron.Assa, The Great Roman Ladies, p. 45. One of the most important tasks for women is to oversee in a large household was clothing production. In the early Roman period, the spinning of wool was a central domestic occupation, and indicated a family's self-sufficiency, since the wool would be produced on their estates. Even in an urban setting, wool was often a symbol of a wife's duties, and equipment for spinning might appear on the funeral monument of a woman to show that she was a good and honorable matron.Assa, The Great Roman Ladies, p. 51. Even women of the upper classes were expected to be able to spin and weave in virtuous emulation of their rustic ancestors ‚Äî a practice ostentatiously observed by Livia. In business \\"One of the most curious characteristics of that age,\\" observed French classical scholar Gaston Boissier, \\"was that the women appear as much engaged in business and as interested in speculations as the men. Money is their first care. They work their estates, invest their funds, lend and borrow. We find one among Cicero's creditors, and two among his debtors.\\"Gaston Boissier, Cicero and his friends: a study of Roman Society in the time of Caesar, Questia edition. Although Roman society did not allow women to gain official political power, it did allow them to enter business.A Casebook on Roman Family Law Frier+McGinn pg 461 Even women of wealth were not supposed to be idle ladies of leisure. Among the aristocracy, women as well as men lent money to their peers to avoid resorting to a moneylender. When Pliny was considering buying an estate, he factored in a loan from his mother-in-law as a guarantee rather than an option.Law and Life of Rome, J.A. Crook pg.172 Women also joined in funding public works, as is frequently documented by inscriptions during the Imperial period. The \\"lawless\\" Politta, who appears in the Martyrdom of Pionius, owned estates in the province of Asia. Inscriptions record her generosity in funding the renovation of the Sardis gymnasium.Christians and Pagans, Fox, Pg. 464 Because women had the right to own property, they might engage in the same business transactions and management practices as any landowner. As with their male counterparts, their management of slaves appears to have varied from relative care to negligence and outright abuse. During the First Servile War, Megallis and her husband Damophilus were both killed by their slaves on account of their brutality, but their daughter was spared because of her kindness and granted safe passage out of Sicily, along with an armed escort.The Gracchi Marius and Sulla, A.H. Beesley, pg. 21 on the first Serville War Women and a man working alongside one another at a dye shop (fullonica), on a wall painting from Pompeii Unlike landholding, industry was not considered an honorable profession for those of senatorial rank. Cicero suggested that in order to gain respectability a merchant should buy land. Attitudes changed during the Empire, however, and Claudius created legislation to encourage the upper classes to engage in shipping. Women of the upper classes are documented as owning and running shipping corporations. Trade and manufacturing are not well represented in Roman literature, which was produced for and largely by the elite, but funerary inscriptions sometimes record the profession of the deceased, including women.See Ancient Roman Life as Illustrated by Latin Inscriptions by Brian K. Harvey. Women are known to have owned and operated brick factories.Abbott, Society and Politics in Ancient Rome: Essays and Sketches, pg. 98 A woman might develop skills to complement her husband's trade, or manage aspects of his business. Artemis the gilder was married to Dionysius the helmet maker, as indicated by a curse tablet asking for the destruction of their household, workshop, work, and livelihood.Women's life in Greece & Rome, Lefkowitz+Fant, pg. 171 The status of ordinary women who owned a business seems to have been regarded as exceptional. Laws during the Imperial period aimed at punishing women for adultery exempted those \\"who have charge of any business or shop\\" from prosecution.Paul, Opinions 2.26.11 L, as cited in Women's Life in Greece and Rome: A Source Book in Translation, edited by Mary R. Lefkowitz and Maureen B. Fant (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982, 3rd ed. 2005), p. 104. Some typical occupations for a woman would be wet nurse, actress, dancer or acrobat, prostitute, and midwife ‚Äî not all of equal respectability.\\"Women and Marriage in Ancient Rome,\\" Chapter 1; Jane Bingham,The Usborne Internet-Linked Encyclopedia of The Roman World (Usborne, 2002), page 48. Prostitutes and performers such as actresses were stigmatized as infames, people who had recourse to few legal protections even if they were free.Catharine Edwards, \\"Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome,\\" in Roman Sexualities (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 66ff. Inscriptions indicate that a woman who was a wet nurse (nutrix) would be quite proud of her occupation.Celia E. Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), p. 54. Women could be scribes and secretaries, including \\"girls trained for beautiful writing,\\" that is, calligraphers.Rawson, Children and Childhood in Roman Italy, p. 80. Pliny gives a list of female artists and their paintings.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 35.147. Most Romans lived in insulae (apartment buildings), and those housing the poorer plebeian and non- citizen families usually lacked kitchens. The need to buy prepared food meant that takeaway food was a thriving business. Most of the Roman poor, whether male or female, young or old, earned a living through their own labour. In politics Porcia, daughter of Cato and wife of Brutus, as pictured by Pierre Mignard Men argued firmly to block women from engaging in the public sphere. The political system in ancient Rome involved men exclusively‚Äîfrom senators to magistrates. Women were even prevented from voting. They were not seen as fit to be part of the political sphere as men believed them to be only suited for \\"elegance, adornment, and finery.\\" However, elite women could manipulate their husbands and through them exercise control over the political world. In some cases, women were viewed as a threat to male rule. Cato the elder went so far as to prevent boys from attending senatorial meetings in fear that they would relay the news to their inquisitive mothers. During the civil wars that ended the Republic, Appian reports the heroism of wives who saved their husbands. An epitaph known as the Laudatio Turiae preserves a husband's eulogy for his wife, who during the civil war following the death of Julius Caesar endangered her own life and relinquished her jewelry to send support to her husband in exile.Arthur Ernest Gordon, Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy (University of California Press, 1983), pp. 34, 103. Both survived the turbulence of the time to enjoy a long marriage. Porcia, the daughter of Cato the Younger and wife of Brutus the assassin, came to a less fortunate but (in the eyes of her time) heroic end: she killed herself as the Republic collapsed, just as her father did. The rise of Augustus to sole power in the last decades of the 1st century BCE diminished the power of political officeholders and the traditional oligarchy, but did nothing to diminish and arguably increased the opportunities for women, as well as slaves and freedmen, to exercise influence behind the scenes.Richard Saller, \\"Status and patronage\\", Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire, A.D. 70‚Äì192 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 18. Before this point, women's political power was extremely curtailed compared to the power men held by preventing their right to vote. However, starting with Augustus' rule, the inability to vote no longer mattered because the senate lost its power. Additionally, the shift from the forum to the palace allowed for women who lived there to gain an upper hand in influencing politics. One notable woman was Livia Drusilla Augusta (58 BCE ‚Äì CE 29), the wife of Augustus and the most powerful woman in the early Roman Empire, acting several times as regent and being Augustus' faithful advisor. Several women of the Imperial family, such as Livia's great- granddaughter and Caligula's sister Agrippina the Younger, gained political influence as well as public prominence. Women also participated in efforts to overthrow the emperors who abused their power. Shortly after Caligula's sister Drusilla died, her widower Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and her sisters Agrippina the Younger and Livilla conspired to overthrow Caligula. The plot was discovered, and Lepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled, and returned from exile only when their paternal uncle Claudius came to power after Caligula's assassination in 41 CE. Women could also be motivated by less than noble causes. Claudius's third wife Valeria Messalina conspired with Gaius Silius to overthrow her husband in the hope of installing herself and her lover in power. Tacitus immortalized the woman Epicharis for her part in the Pisonian conspiracy, where she attempted to gain the support of the Roman fleet and was instead arrested.Tacitus, Annals 15.51 Once the conspiracy was uncovered, she would reveal nothing even under torture, in contrast to the senators, who were not subjected to torture and yet raced to spill the details. Tacitus also praises Egnatia Maximilla for sacrificing her fortune in order to stand by her innocent husband against Nero.Tacitus, Annals 15.71. According to the Historia Augusta (Elagabalus 4.2 and 12.3) emperor Elagabalus had his mother or grandmother take part in Senate proceedings. \\"And Elagabalus was the only one of all the emperors under whom a woman attended the senate like a man, just as though she belonged to the senatorial order\\" (David Magie's translation). According to the same work, Elagabalus also established a women's senate called the senaculum, which enacted rules to be applied to matrons, regarding clothing, chariot riding, the wearing of jewelry etc. (Elagabalus 4.3 and Aurelian 49.6). Before this, Agrippina the Younger, mother of Nero, had been listening to Senate proceedings, concealed behind a curtain, according to Tacitus (Annales, 13.5). Women and the military Classical texts have little to say about women and the Roman army. Emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BC‚ÄìAD 14) disallowed marriage by ordinary soldiers, a ban that lasted nearly two centuries. However it has been suggested that wives and children of centurions lived with them at border and provincial forts.Allison P. (2011) 'Soldiers‚Äô families in the early Roman Empire', in B. Rawson, ed., Family and household in ancient Greece and Rome: a companion, 161‚Äì182. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell Shoes in women's and children's sizes were found at VindolandaGreene, E.M. (2014). ‚ÄúIf the shoe fits: Style and function of children‚Äôs shoes from Vindolanda‚Äù in R. Collins and F. McIntosh (eds.), Life in the Limes: Studies of the People and Objects of the Roman Frontiers. Oxford: Oxbow. 29‚Äì36. (site of a Roman fort on Hadrian's wall in northern England), along with bronze plaques, awarded to provincial soldiers whose 25 years of service earned them Roman citizenship, that mention their wives and children. Likewise, in Germany, further evidence of this practice was discovered in the form of brooches and shoes. Trajan's Column depicts six women amongst the soldiers who are attendants holding sacrificial offerings at a military religious ceremony.Greene, E.M. (2015) 'Girls or Boys on the Column of Trajan? Depictions of Female Participation in Military Religion' presented at 116th Joint Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America and the Society for Classical Studies (formerly the American Philological Association), January 8‚Äì11, 2015. Religious life Ruins of the House of the Vestals, with pedestals for statuary in the foreground Women were present at most Roman festivals and cult observances. Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their participation might be limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies,Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 297. though this was less a matter of prohibition than the fact that most priests presiding over state religion were men.Celia E. Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 134‚Äì136. In some sense, every head of household was a priest responsible for religious maintenance at home; in Roman patriarchal society, this was the paterfamilias. Public religion, like society and politics in general, reflected the hierarchy of the household, since the familia was the building block of society. See John Scheid, An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 129ff. Some cult practices were reserved for women only, for example, the rites of the Good Goddess (Bona Dea).Beard et al., Religions of Rome, vol. 1, pp. 296‚Äì297. Women priests played a prominent and crucial role in the official religion of Rome. Although the state colleges of male priests were far more numerous, the six women of the college of Vestals were Rome's only \\"full-time professional clergy.\\"Phyllis Culham, \\"Women in the Roman Republic,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 143. Sacerdos, plural sacerdotes, was the Latin word for a priest of either gender. Religious titles for women include sacerdos, often in relation to a deity or temple, such as a sacerdos Cereris or Cerealis, \\"priestess of Ceres\\", an office never held by men;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, The Roman Goddess Ceres (University of Texas Press, 1996), p. 104. magistra, a high priestess, female expert or teacher in religious matters; and ministra, a female assistant, particularly one in service to a deity. A magistra or ministra would have been responsible for the regular maintenance of a cult. Epitaphs provide the main evidence for these priesthoods, and the woman is often not identified in terms of her marital status.Lesley E. Lundeen, \\"In Search of the Etruscan Priestess: A Re- Examination of the hatrencu,\\" in Religion in Republican Italy (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 46; Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic, pp. 70‚Äì71. The Vestals possessed unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. It was also possible for them to amass \\"considerable wealth.\\"Ariadne Staples, From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion (Routledge, 1998), p. 184. Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her father's authority. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly and only to the Pontifex Maximus.Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 141. Their vow of chastity freed them of the traditional obligation to marry and rear children, but its violation carried a heavy penalty: a Vestal found to have polluted her office by breaking her vow was given food, water, and entombed alive. The independence of the Vestals thus existed in relation to the prohibitions imposed on them. In addition to conducting certain religious rites, the Vestals participated at least symbolically in every official sacrifice, as they were responsible for preparing the required ritual substance mola salsa.Staples, From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins, pp. 154‚Äì155. The Vestals seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century CE, until the Christian emperors dissolved the order. A few priesthoods were held jointly by married couples. Marriage was a requirement for the Flamen Dialis, the high priest of Jupiter; his wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own unique priestly attire, and like her husband was placed under obscure magico-religious prohibitions. The flaminica was a perhaps exceptional case of a woman performing animal sacrifice; she offered a ram to Jupiter on each of the nundinae, the eight-day Roman cycle comparable to a week.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.16. The couple were not permitted to divorce, and if the flaminica died the flamen had to resign his office. The Capitoline Triad of Minerva, Jupiter, and Juno Like the Flaminica Dialis, the regina sacrorum, \\"queen of the sacred rites,\\" wore distinctive ceremonial dress and performed animal sacrifice, offering a sow or female lamb to Juno on the first day of each month.Emily A. Hemelrijk, \\"Women and Sacrifice in the Roman Empire,\\" in Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5‚Äì7, 2007) (Brill, 2009), pp. 258‚Äì259, citing Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.15.19. The names of some reginae sacrorum are recorded by inscriptions.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Fasti sacerdotum: A Prosopography of Pagan, Jewish, and Christian Religious Officials in the City of Rome, 300 BCE to CE 499 (Oxford University Press, 2008, originally published in German 2005), pp. 223, 783, 840. The regina was the wife of the rex sacrorum, \\"king of the sacred rites,\\" an archaic priesthood regarded in the earliest period as more prestigious than even the Pontifex Maximus.Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome, p. 136, based on Festus on the ordo sacerdotum (hierarchy of priests), 198 in the edition of Lindsay. These highly public official duties for women contradict the commonplace notion that women in ancient Rome took part only in private or domestic religion. The dual male-female priesthoods may reflect the Roman tendency to seek a gender complement within the religious sphere;Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic, pp. 79‚Äì81. most divine powers are represented by both a male and a female deity, as seen in divine pairs such as Liber and Libera.Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), pp. 141‚Äì142 online. The twelve major gods were presented as six gender- balanced pairs,Varro, De re rustica 1.1.4, says their golden images stood in the forum, \\"six male and the same number of female.\\" and Roman religion departed from Indo-European tradition in installing two goddesses in its supreme triad of patron deities, Juno and Minerva along with Jupiter. This triad \\"formed the core of Roman religion.\\"The Capitoline Triad replaced the Indo-European Archaic Triad, composed of three male gods, and is thought to result from Etruscan influence; see Robert Schilling, Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), pp. 73, 87, 131, 150. diviner From the Mid Republic onward, religious diversity became increasingly characteristic of the city of Rome. Many religions that were not part of Rome's earliest state cult offered leadership roles for women, among them the cult of Isis and of the Magna Mater. An epitaph preserves the title sacerdos maxima for a woman who held the highest priesthood of the Magna Mater's temple near the current site of St. Peter's Basilica.Stephen L. Dyson, Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), p. 283. Although less documented than public religion, private religious practices addressed aspects of life that were exclusive to women. At a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent,M. Golden, \\"Did the Ancients Care When Their Children Died?\\" Greece & Rome 35 (1988) 152‚Äì163. divine aid was solicited for the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby. Invocations were directed at the goddesses Juno, Diana, Lucina, the di nixi, and a host of divine attendants devoted to birth and childrearing. Male writers vary in their depiction of women's religiosity: some represent women as paragons of Roman virtue and devotion, but also inclined by temperament to excessive religious devotion, the lure of magic, or \\"superstition\\".Beard et al., Religions of Rome, vol. 1, p. 297. Nor was \\"private\\" the same as \\"secret\\": Romans were suspicious of secretive religious practices, and Cicero cautioned that nocturnal sacrifices were not to be performed by women, except for those ritually prescribed pro populo, on behalf of the Roman people, that is, for the public good.Cicero, De legibus 2.9.21; Emily A. Hemelrijk, \\"Women and Sacrifice in the Roman Empire,\\" in Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5‚Äì7, 2007) (Brill, 2009), p. 255. Social activities Mosaic showing Roman women in various recreational activities Wealthy women traveled around the city in a litter carried by slaves.Assa, The Great Roman Ladies, p. 73. Women gathered in the streets on a daily basis to meet with friends, attend religious rites at temples, or to visit the baths. The wealthiest families had private baths at home, but most people went to bath houses not only to wash but to socialize, as the larger facilities offered a range of services and recreational activities, among which casual sex was not excluded. One of the most vexed questions of Roman social life is whether the sexes bathed together in public. Until the late Republic, evidence suggests that women usually bathed in a separate wing or facility, or that women and men were scheduled at different times. But there is also clear evidence of mixed bathing from the late Republic until the rise of Christian dominance in the later Empire. Some scholars have thought that only lower- class women bathed with men, or those of dubious moral standing such as entertainers or prostitutes, but Clement of Alexandria observed that women of the highest social classes could be seen naked at the baths. Hadrian prohibited mixed bathing, but the ban seems not to have endured. Most likely, customs varied not only by time and place, but by facility, so that women could choose to segregate themselves by gender or not.Garrett G. Fagan, Bathing in Public in the Roman World (University of Michigan Press, 1999, 2002), pp. 26‚Äì27. For entertainment women could attend debates at the Forum, the public games (ludi), chariot races, and theatrical performances. By the late Republic, they regularly attended dinner parties, though in earlier times the women of a household dined in private together.Assa, The Great Roman Ladies, p. 92. Conservatives such as Cato the Elder (234‚Äì149 BCE) considered it improper for women to take a more active role in public life; his complaints indicated that indeed some women did voice their opinions in the public sphere.Livius, Titus, A History of Rome, (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Pub, 2006), 182. Though the practice was discouraged, Roman generals would sometimes take their wives with them on military campaigns. Caligula's mother Agrippina the Elder often accompanied her husband Germanicus on his campaigns in northern Germania, and the emperor Claudius was born in Gaul for this reason. Wealthy women might tour the empire, often participating or viewing religious ceremonies and sites around the empire.Assa, 102. Rich women traveled to the countryside during the summer when Rome became too hot.Assa, 96. For more on how women fit into social classes in ancient Rome, see Social Class in ancient Rome. Attire and adornment Livia attired in a stola and palla Women in ancient Rome took great care in their appearance, though extravagance was frowned upon. They wore cosmetics and made different concoctions for their skin. Ovid even wrote a poem about the correct application of makeup. Women used white chalk or arsenic to whiten their faces, or rouge made of lead or carmine to add color to their cheeks as well as using lead to highlight their eyes.Assa, 65. They spent much time arranging their hair and often dyed it black, red, or blonde. They also wore wigs regularly.Assa, 60. Matrons usually wore two simple tunics for undergarments covered by a stola. The stola was a long white dress that was cinched at the waist and which fell to the wearer‚Äôs feet, secured by clasps at the shoulder. Wealthier women would decorate their stola further. When going out a woman wore a palla over her stola, which was held by a clasp at the shoulder.Assa, 65 Young women were not permitted to wear a stola, and instead wore tunics.Assa, 66. Prostitutes and those caught committing adultery put on the male toga. Wealthy women wore jewels such as emeralds, aquamarine, opal, and pearls as earrings, necklaces, rings and sometimes sewn onto their shoes and clothing.Assa, 67. Flavian period (80s‚Äì90s CE) In the aftermath of Roman defeat at Cannae, economic crisis provoked the passing of the Lex Oppia (215 BCE) to restrict personal and public extravagance. The law limited women's possession and display of gold and silver (as money or personal ornament), expensive clothing and their \\"unnecessary\\" use of chariots and litters. Victory over Carthage flooded Rome with wealth and in 195 BCE the Lex Oppia was reviewed. The ruling consul, Cato the Censor argued for its retention: personal morality and self-restraint were self-evidently inadequate controls on indulgence and luxury. Luxury provoked the envy and shame of those less well-off, and was therefore divisive. Roman women, in Cato's view, had showed only too clearly that their appetites once corrupted knew no limits, and must be restrained. Large numbers of Roman matrons thought otherwise, and made concerted public protest. In 193 BCE the laws were abolished: Cato's opposition did not harm his political career. Later, in 42 BCE, Roman women, led by Hortensia, successfully protested against laws designed to tax Roman women, by use of the argument of no taxation without representation.Pomeroy, Sarah Jane, Women in Classical Antiquity Evidence of a lessening on luxury restrictions can also be found; one of the Letters of Pliny is addressed to the woman Pompeia Celerina praising the luxuries she keeps in her villa.Pliny the Younger, Letters, Book 1 letter IV Body image Venus, goddess of beauty and love (2nd century) Based on Roman art and literature, small breasts and wide hips were the ideal body type for women considered alluring by Roman men.Kelly Olson, \\"The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl,\\" in Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 143. Roman art from the Augustan period shows idealized women as substantial and fleshy, with a full abdomen and breasts that are rounded,John R. Clarke, Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 250 (University of California Press, 1998, 2001), p. 34. not pendulous.Amy Richlin, The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 68, 110. Prostitutes depicted in Roman erotic art have fleshy bodies and wide hips, and often have their breasts covered by a strophium (a sort of strapless bra) even when otherwise nude and performing sex acts.Clarke, Looking at Lovemaking, p. 34 et passim. Large breasts were mocked as humorous or a sign of old age.Martial, Epigrams 1.100, 2.52, 14.66; Richlin, The Garden of Priapus, pp. 52, 54, 68. Young girls wore a strophium secured tightly in the belief that it would inhibit the growth of breasts,Olson, \\"The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl,\\" p. 143. and a regimen of massaging the breasts with hemlock, begun while a woman was still a virgin, was thought to prevent sagging.Pliny the Elder, Natural History 25.95, citing Anaxilaus, a Pythagorean physician in the time of Augustus; Matthew W. Dickie, Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World (Routledge, 2001, 2005), p. 167. Pliny also notes that an application of hemlock was used to suppress lactation. Breasts receive relatively minimal attention in erotic art and literature as a sexual focus;Richlin, The Garden of Priapus, p. 38. the breast was associated primarily with nursing infants and a woman's role as a mother.Larissa Bonfante, \\"Nursing Mothers in Classical Art,\\" in Naked Truths: Women, Sexuality, and Gender in Classical Art and Archaeology (Routledge, 1997, 2000), pp. 174ff. In times of extreme emotional duress, such as mourning or captivity in wartime, women might bare their breasts as an apotropaic gesture.Anthony Corbeill, Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 87ff.; Alan Cameron, The Last Pagans of Rome (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 725; Mary Lefkowitz and Maureen B. Fant, Women's Life in Greece and Rome, p. 350, note 5. Mos maiorum and the love poets Romantic scene from a mosaic (Villa at Centocelle, Rome, 20 BCE‚Äì20 CE) During the late Republic penalties for sexuality were barely enforced if at all,Citation needed and a new erotic ideal of romantic relationship emerges. Subverting the tradition of male dominance, the love poets of the late Republic and Augustan era declared their eagerness to submit to \\"love slavery\\" (servitium amoris). Catullus addresses a number of poems to \\"Lesbia,\\" a married woman with whom he has an affair, usually identified as a fictionalized Clodia, sister of the prominent popularist politician Clodius Pulcher. The affair ends badly, and Catullus's declarations of love turn to attacks on her sexual appetites ‚Äî rhetoric that accords with the other hostile source on Clodia's behavior, Cicero's Pro Caelio. In The Art of Love, Ovid goes a step further, adopting the genre of didactic poetry for offering instruction in how to pursue, keep, and get over a lover. Satirists such as Juvenal complain about the dissolute behavior of women.Juvenal, Satire VI lines 6.286‚Äì313 Gynecology and medicine The practices and views in the Hippocratic Corpus regarding women's bodies and their perceived weaknesses were inadequate for addressing the needs of women in the Hellenistic and Roman eras, when women led active lives and more often engaged in family planning. The physiology of women began to be seen as less alien to that of men.Ann Ellis Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology at Rome,\\" in Les √©coles m√©dicales √† Rome (Universit√© de Nantes, 1991), p. 259. In the older tradition, intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth were not only central to women's health, but the raison d'√™tre for female physiology;Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\\" p. 259‚Äì260; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to Roman Sexualities (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11: The \\"notion of women as 'Same' as well as 'Other' presupposed a female body partly assimilated to the male constitution, one whose sex-specific functions, such as lactation or even pregnancy, did not constitute its entire raison d'√™tre.\\" men, by contrast, were advised to exercise moderation in their sexual behavior, since hypersexuality would cause disease and fatigue.Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\\" pp. 259‚Äì260. A female artist paints a statue of the phallic god Priapus The Hippocratic view that amenorrhea was fatal became by Roman times a specific issue of infertility, and was recognized by most Roman medical writers as a likely result when women engage in intensive physical regimens for extended periods of time. Balancing food, exercise, and sexual activity came to be regarded as a choice that women might make. The observation that intensive training was likely to result in amenorrhea implies that there were women who engaged in such regimens.Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\\" p. 260. The Gynecology of Soranus is central to Hanson's arguments. In the Roman era, medical writers saw a place for exercise in the lives of women in sickness and health. Soranus recommends playing ball, swimming, walking, reading aloud, riding in vehicles, and travel as recreation, which would promote overall good health.Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\\" p. 264. In examining the causes of undesired childlessness, these later gynecological writers include information about sterility in men, rather than assuming some defect in the woman only.Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\\" p. 265. Hypersexuality was to be avoided by women as well as men. An enlarged clitoris, like an oversized phallus,Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\\" p. 267, citing Priapea 78 on the vitiating effects of uncontrolled sexual activity and releasing too much semen, and CIL 12.6721(5), one of the Perusine glandes. The outsized phallus of Roman art was associated with the god Priapus, among others. It was laughter-provoking, grotesque, or used for magical purposes; see David Fredrick, The Roman Gaze: Vision, Power, and the Body (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), p. 156. Nude statues of men that were intended to be beautiful or dignified had a small penis. was considered a symptom of excessive sexuality. Although Hellenistic and Roman medical and other writers refer to clitoridectomy as primarily an \\"Egyptian\\" custom, gynecological manuals under the Christian Empire in late antiquity propose that hypersexuality could be treated by surgery or repeated childbirth.Hanson, \\"The Restructuring of Female Physiology,\\" p. 267. Clitoridectomy is described in some detail by the Byzantine physicians and medical writers A√´tius of Amida (fl. mid-5th century/mid-6th century) and Paul of Aegina, as well as the North African gynecological writer Muscio (ca. 500 CE); see Holt N. Parker, \\"The Teratogenic Grid,\\" in Roman Sexualities (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 59. Slavery Freedwomen were manumitted slaves. A freed slave owed a period of service, the terms of which might be agreed upon as a precondition of freedom, to her former owner, who became her patron. The patron had obligations in return, such as paying for said services and helping in legal matters. The patron-client relationship was one of the fundamental social structures of ancient Rome, and failure to fulfill one's obligations brought disapproval and censure. In most ways, freedwomen had the same legal status as freeborn women. But because under Roman law a slave had no father, freed slaves had no inheritance rights unless they were named in a will. The relationship of a former slave to her patron could be complicated. In one legal case, a woman named Petronia Iusta attempted to show ‚Äî without a birth declaration to prove it ‚Äî that she had been free-born. Her mother, she acknowledged, had been a slave in the household of Petronius Stephanus and Calatoria Themis, but Iusta maintained that she had been born after her mother's manumission. Calatoria, by now a widow, in turn argued that Iusta was born before her mother was free and that she had been manumitted, therefore owing her former owner the service due a patron. Calatoria could produce no documentation of this supposed manumission, and the case came down to the testimony of witnesses.J.A. Crook, Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-A.D. 212 (Cornell University Press, 1967, 1984), pp. 48‚Äì50. The status of freedwomen, like freedmen, varied widely. Caenis was a freedwoman and secretary to the Emperor Vespasian; she was also his concubine. He is said to have lived with her faithfully, but she was not considered a wife.Crook, Law and Life of Rome, p. 101. Prostitution Women could turn to prostitution to support themselves, but not all prostitutes had freedom to decide. There is some evidence that even slave prostitutes could benefit from their labor.The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World: A Study of social History and the Brothel By Thomas A. McGinn. pg. 52 Although rape was a crime, the law only punished the rape of a slave if it \\"damaged the goods,\\" because a slave had no legal standing. The penalty was aimed at providing her owner compensation for the \\"damage\\" of his property. Because a slave woman was considered property under Roman law, forcing her to be a prostitute was not considered a crime. Prior to Septimius Severus, women who engaged in acts that brought infamia to them as slaves also suffered infamia when freed.Thomas AJ McGinn, Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome, Oxford University Press. 1998, p. 56. Sometimes sellers of female slaves attached a ne serva clause to the slave to prevent her from being prostituted. The Ne Serva clause meant that if the new owner or any owner after him or her used the slave as a prostitute she would be free. Later on the ne serva agreements became enforceable by law.Thomas AJ McGinn, Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 293 Prostitution was not limited to slaves or poor citizens; according to Suetonius, Caligula when converting his palace into a brothel employed upper class \\"matrons and youths\\" as prostitutes. Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula, Tacitus records that during one of Nero's feasts the prefect Tigellinus had brothels filled with upper class women.Tacitus, Annals 15.37 Prostitution could also be a punishment instead of an occupation; a law of Augustus allowed that women guilty of adultery could be sentenced to work in brothels as prostitutes. The law was abolished in 389.Thomas AJ McGinn, Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 171, 310.

It was designed to overcome two limitations on the traditional piano keyboard: the large-scale geometry of the keys (stretching beyond a ninth, or even an octave, can be difficult or impossible for pianists with small hands), and the fact that each scale has to be fingered differently. Instead of a single row, the Jank√≥ keyboard has an array of keys consisting of two interleaved manuals with three touch-points for every key lever, making six rows of keys. Each vertical column of three keys is a semitone away from the neighboring ones, which are in the alternate rows. Thus within each row the interval from one note to the next is a whole step. This key layout results in each chord and scale having the same shape on the keyboard with the same fingerings regardless of key, so there is no change in geometry when transposing music. Furthermore, the use of multiple rows allows the pianist to more naturally follow the contour of their hand and accounts for the different lengths of the fingers. The configuration retains the colouring of traditional keyboards (white naturals, black sharps and flats) for pedagogical purposes. Jank√≥ keyboard layout For an 88-note (full size) keyboard, there would be 264 keys in total, with each note playable by three keys in vertical alignment. In the picture above, the white keys have been coloured to show how the keys are interconnected. Instead of the keyboard is only wide, and the smaller key size allows reaching wider intervals.Naragon 1977, p. 30. The Jank√≥ Keyboard caused a stir at the time of its invention, in large part due to its unique look and the intelligent design behind the keyboard. American piano manufacturer Decker Brothers put the keyboard into production around 1891, and the Paul de Janko Conservatory of Music was established in New York around the same time. There was even a manual written by W. Bradley Keeler called How to Play the New Keyboard. Despite all this, the Jank√≥ keyboard never achieved wide popularity. Music educators were not convinced that the benefits of the new keyboard were enough to challenge the traditional keyboard. Few performers were prepared to relearn their repertoire on a new keyboard with entirely different fingering. Both reasons left keyboard instrument manufacturers afraid to invest in a redesigned keyboard which promised to have only marginal commercial success.Naragon 1977, pp. 15‚Äì17, 140‚Äì142 Many embodiments of this keyboard have appeared since its conception. Jank√≥ himself (in German patent 25852, dated 14 January 1884) originally chose a key shape which resembled the slim, black keys on the familiar piano keyboard. A year later (in German patent 32138, dated 1 July 1885) the keys became wider and shorter. Other inventors have filed patents for keyboards which are substantially similar to his design, differing most often in key shape or instrument to which those keyboards are affixed. (For example: John Trotter English Patent 3404, 4 March 1811, William A. B. Lunn devised in 1843 under the name of Arthur Wallbridge a sequential keyboard with two parallel rows of keys, each in whole tones.

Background and signing  In 1834, a document known as the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand was drafted by 34 northern MƒÅori chiefs ‚Äî including TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene, Tƒ´tore and Bay of Islands brothers; Te Wharerahi, Rewa, and Moka Te Kainga-mataa ‚Äî together with James Busby, the official British Resident in New Zealand. The document was initially signed at Waitangi on 28 October 1835. By 1839, 52 chiefs had signed.. In the process of signing, the chiefs established themselves as representing a confederation under the title of the \\"United Tribes of New Zealand\\". Missionaries Henry Williams and George Clarke translated the Declaration and signed as witnesses; 261 merchants James Clendon and Gilbert Mair also signed as witnesses. The Declaration arose in response to concerns over the lawlessness of British subjects in New Zealand, and in response to a fear that France would declare sovereignty over the islands. At this time a Frenchman, Charles de Thierry‚Äîwho titled himself 'Charles, Baron de Tierry, Sovereign Chief of New Zealand and King of Nuku Hiva' (in the Marquesas Islands)‚Äîwas seeking to establish a colony on a plot of land he claimed to have purchased in the Hokianga. The document also arose from movements in MƒÅori society. From 1816 onwards, a number of Northern MƒÅori chiefs had made visits to the colonies in New South Wales and Norfolk Island, as well as to England, leading to discussions about unifying the tribes and the formation of a MƒÅori government. MƒÅori had become involved in international trade and owned trading ships. In 1834, the chiefs had selected a flag for use on ships originating from New Zealand. The need for a flag of New Zealand first became clear when the merchant ship the Sir George Murray, built in the Hokianga, was seized by customs officials in the port of Sydney. The ship had been sailing without a flag‚Äîa violation of British navigation laws. New Zealand was not a colony at the time and had no flag. The ship's detainment reportedly aroused indignation among the MƒÅori population. Unless a flag was selected, ships would continue to be seized. The flag, amended slightly when officially gazetted, became the first distinctively New Zealand flag. As late as 1900 it was still being used to depict New Zealand, and it appeared on the South African War Medal which was issued to New Zealand soldiers of the Boer War and was inscribed with the phrase \\"Success to New Zealand Contingent 1899‚Äì1900\\".Caption to photo, Alexander Turnbull Library, retrieved 15 January 2012 The unamended version of the flag, with eight- pointed stars and black fimbriation, is still widely used by MƒÅori groups. The Declaration is displayed at the National Library of New Zealand, as part of the He Tohu exhibition, along with the Treaty of Waitangi and the 1893 Women's Suffrage Petition.  The Declaration  The hereditary chiefs and heads of the tribes of the northern parts of New Zealand declared the constitution of an independent state. They agreed to meet in Waitangi each year to frame laws, and invited the southern tribes of New Zealand to \\"lay aside their private animosities\\" and join them. Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand The original design of the flag, with eight-pointed stars and black fimbriation, is today widely used by MƒÅori groups. New Zealand United Tribes flag, 1833-1835, drawn by Nicholas Charles Phillips of the man-of-war HMS Alligator.  Explanation of the MƒÅori text The MƒÅori text of the Declaration was made by the tino rangatira (hereditary chiefs) of the northern part of New Zealand and uses the term Rangatiratanga to mean independence, declaring the country a whenua Rangatira (independent state) to be known as The United Tribes of New Zealand (Te Wakaminenga o nga Hapu o Nu Tireni). The translation of the second paragraph is \\"that all sovereign power and authority in the land\\" (\\"Ko te Kingitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua\\") should \\"reside entirely and exclusively in the hereditary chiefs and heads of tribes in their collective capacity\\", expressed as the United Tribes of New Zealand. The terms Kingitanga and mana were used in claiming sovereignty of the state to the assembly of the hereditary chiefs, and it was also declared that no government (kawanatanga) would exist except by persons appointed by the assembly of hereditary chiefs. The impacts of the Declaration The signatories sent a copy of the document to King William IV (who reigned from 1830 to 1837), asking him to act as the protector of the new state. The King had previously acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and now recognised the Declaration in a letter from Lord Glenelg (British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies), following consideration of the Declaration by the House of Lords, dated 25 May 1836. It read, in part: The Declaration was not well received by the Colonial Office, and it was decided that a new policy for New Zealand was needed as a corrective. It is notable that the Treaty of Waitangi was made between the British Crown and \\"the chiefs of the United Tribes of New Zealand\\" in recognition of their independent sovereignty.  Legal effect  PƒÅkehƒÅ writers have dismissed the significance of He Whakaputanga as an attempt by James Busby to establish a 'settled form of government', whereas MƒÅori unity movements looked to the document as the basis for MƒÅori claims to self-determination, and something that reaffirmed tikanga MƒÅori and MƒÅori concepts of power and decision-making. In 2010 the NgƒÅpuhi iwi (tribe) in Northland requested that the Waitangi Tribunal rule on whether the tribe had in fact relinquished sovereignty in 1840 when they signed the Treaty.  NgƒÅpuhi Waitangi Tribunal claim (Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry)  In 2010 the Waitangi Tribunal began hearing NgƒÅpuhi's claim that sovereignty was not ceded in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal, in their Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (Wai 1040) is in the process of considering the MƒÅori and Crown understandings of the Declaration and the Treaty. This aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the MƒÅori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty.Paul Moon (2002) Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi The first stage of the report was released in November 2014, and found that MƒÅori chiefs never agreed to give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Tribunal manager Julie Tangaere said at the report's release to the Ngapuhi claimants: While final submissions were received in May 2018, the second stage of the report was still in the process of being written up as of June 2020.

Robinson as Special Assistant to the President and Speechwriter\\". The Papers of the Presidents. Retrieved April 20, 2013.) is an American author, research fellow, television host and former speechwriter for then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and President Ronald Reagan. He is currently the host of Uncommon Knowledge, an interview show by Stanford's Hoover Institution. He is also a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a co-founder of the Ricochet website. Early life and education Robinson grew up in Vestal, New York. He attended Dartmouth College from 1975 to 1979, where he was a member of Kappa Kappa Kappa, and wrote for The Dartmouth. He majored in English and graduated summa cum laude, then continued his studies at Christ Church, Oxford University, pursuing a second Bachelor's degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics and graduating in 1982. Robinson also attended Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. He graduated with an MBA in 1990. Speechwriter After Oxford, Robinson applied for a position at the White House. In an event he describes as a \\"fluke\\",Peter Robinson, Snapshots from Hell: The Making of an MBA, 1994, Nicholas Brealey Publishing, paperback, , pg 12 he was given a job as the chief speechwriter for Vice President Bush. In what he calls a \\"second fluke\\", he was then transferred to President Reagan's staff as a special assistant and speechwriter, where he wrote the famed 1987 Tear down this wall address. Referencing Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's refusal to remove the Berlin Wall, the speech, delivered by Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin on 12 June 1987, contained the sentence: \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\\" On arrival in the city before writing the speech, Robinson was warned by US diplomats to avoid Cold War rhetoric and that Berliners had adjusted to the presence of the Berlin Wall. However, after consultation with local Berliners, he found them deeply wounded and concerned about the wall; in many instances it had separated families and represented an intrusion of a police state into daily life. Returning to Washington D.C., Robinson's phrase became controversial with the State Department and other staff members, including Chief of Staff Howard Baker and National Security Advisor Colin Powell. Repeated attempts were made to remove it from the speech, but Reagan overruled them, wishing to communicate not only with West Berliners but with East Germans on the other side of the wall. Reagan went so far as to say \\"yes, this wall will fall\\", and that \\"As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.\\" Robinson wrote more than 300 speeches during his White House tenure. After serving for six years, Robinson attended business school at Stanford University where he earned a Master of Business Administration in 1990. The journal he kept of his two-year experience there was the basis for his book Snapshots from Hell: The Making of an MBA, published in 1994, which details the considerable difficulty he encountered during the first year of business school due to his lack of a \\"quantitative background\\". Research fellow In the early 1990s, Robinson joined the News Corporation run by Rupert Murdoch, and then served as press secretary to the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 1993, Robinson became a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford's conservative research center. In addition to writing about business and politics, he also edits the Hoover Digest and hosted a PBS public affairs television program Uncommon Knowledge, later re-branded as a Web cast at hoover.org, and then arranged to be released semiweekly on National Review Online. He has written How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life and It‚Äôs My Party: A Republican's Messy Love Affair with the GOP, a study of the Republican Party. He served on the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College from 2005 to 2013. Personal life and writings Robinson lives in northern California with his wife, Edita, and their five children. Edita's parents left Cuba in 1959 and she was born about 18 months later. In 2003, he published his third book, How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life. He has stated that it is \\"nothing less than a love story ‚Äì an account of the profound respect and affection that one young man came to feel for the President who changed his life forever.\\" The book received a favorable review from Margaret Thatcher, and she has remarked that it features a \\"wealth of insights\\".\\"How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life\\".

Running is sometimes defined as requiring a moment of no contact to the ground, whereas jogging often sustains the contact.Are you running properly? at BBC Sport History A detail of an ancient mosaic depicting a young woman who jogs with dumbbells, 4th century AD The word jog originated in England in the mid-16th century. The etymology of the word is unknown, but it may be related to shog or have been a new invention. In 1593, William Shakespeare wrote in Taming of the Shrew, \\"you may be jogging whiles your boots are green\\". At that point, it usually meant to leave.Crystal, David. Think On My Words: Exploring Shakespeare's Language, Cambridge University Press, 2008. on p. 237 at Google Books The term jog was often used in English and North American literature to describe short quick movements, either intentional or unintentional. It is also used to describe a quick, sharp shake or jar. Richard Jefferies, an English naturalist, wrote of \\"joggers\\", describing them as quickly moving people who brushed others aside as they passed.Jeffries, Richard. The Open Air at Project Gutenberg This usage became common throughout the British Empire, and in his 1884 novel My Run Home, the Australian author Rolf Boldrewood wrote, \\"Your bedroom curtains were still drawn as I passed on my morning jog.\\" In the United States jogging was called \\"roadwork\\" when athletes in training, such as boxers, customarily ran several miles each day as part of their conditioning. In New Zealand during the 1960s or 1970s, the word \\"roadwork\\" was mostly supplanted by the word \\"jogging\\", promoted by coach Arthur Lydiard, who is credited with popularizing jogging. The idea of jogging as an organised activity was mooted in a sports page article in The New Zealand Herald in February 1962, which told of a group of former athletes and fitness enthusiasts who would meet once a week to run for \\"fitness and sociability\\". Since they would be jogging, the newspaper suggested that the club \\"may be called the Auckland Joggers' Club\\"‚Äîwhich is thought to be the first use of the noun \\"jogger\\". University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman, after jogging with Lydiard in New Zealand in 1962, started a joggers' club in Eugene in early 1963. He published the book Jogging in 1966, popularizing jogging in the United States. Exercise Members of the United States Air Force Academy American football team jog on Waikiki beach, Hawaii.Jogging may also be used as a warm up or cool down for runners, preceding or following a workout or race. It is often used by serious runners as a means of active recovery during interval training. For example, a runner who completes a fast 400 metre repetition at a sub-5-minute mile pace (3 minute km) may drop to an 8-minute mile jogging pace (5 minute km) for a recovery lap. Jogging can be used as a method to increase endurance or to provide a means of cardiovascular exercise but with less stress on joints or demand on the circulatory system. Benefits According to a study by Stanford University School of Medicine, jogging is effective in increasing human lifespan, and decreasing the effects of aging,Running slows the aging clock, Stanford researchers find , Stanford School of Medicine Press Release with benefits for the cardiovascular system. Jogging is useful for fighting obesity and staying healthy. S√§pojoggen jogging event in Sweden The National Cancer Institute has performed studies that suggest jogging and other types of aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of lung, colon, breast and prostate cancers, among others. It is suggested by the American Cancer Society that jogging for at least 30 minutes five days a week can help in cancer prevention. While jogging on a treadmill will provide health benefits such as cancer prevention, and aid in weight loss, a study published in BMC Public Health reports that jogging outdoors can have the additional benefits of increased energy and concentration. Jogging outdoors is a better way to improve energy levels and advance mood than using a treadmill at the gym. Jogging also prevents muscle and bone damage that often occurs with age, improves heart performance and blood circulation and assists in preserving a balanced weight gain. A Danish study released in 2015 reported that \\"light\\" and \\"moderate\\" jogging were associated with reduced mortality compared to both non-jogging and \\"strenuous\\" jogging. The optimal amount per week was 1 to 2.4 hours, the optimal frequency was less than or equal to 3 times per week and the optimal speed was \\"slow\\" or \\"average\\". A recent meta- analysis on running/jogging and mortality, including more than 230,000 participants found that runners were at 27% lower risk of death than non- runners, during 5.5-35 year follow-ups.

After the House of Commons passed the Bill, Charles dissolved Parliament; when a new Parliament was elected shortly afterwards, Charles simply refused to summon it to meet. The Petitioners got their name from the many petitions they sent to Charles urging him to summon Parliament; they were opposed by the Abhorrers, who resisted the Exclusion Bill and were in no hurry to see a pro-Exclusion Bill Parliament meet. In the heat of the dispute, the two factions traded insulting epithets; with the result that the Petitioners became known as the Whigs and their opponents as Tories.

The island is used by the Singaporean military and not open to the general public. Transport to the island for permitted persons is by SAF Changi Ferry Terminal. The island is expanding due to land reclamation works on its southern and northwestern coasts which will eventually subsume many of its surrounding small islets, including the Pulau Tekong Kechil. Etymology Pulau Tekong lies in the distance in the background, as taken from Changi Beach Park. Pulau Tekong appears in the Franklin and Jackson's 1828 map as Po. Tukang. The early name could have arisen because the island served as a trading station for both residents of Pulau Ubin and the state of Johor. Tukang means merchants in this case. Tekong means \\"an obstacle\\", so- called because the island blocks the mouth of the Sungai Johor. Pulo Tekong Besar came under the Changi district, and the island had a sizeable population, being the largest island off Singapore and two miles from Fairy Point. Ferries plied from the pier at that point and the island daily. After 1920, it was mostly known for its rubber plantations. History The island was once home to 5000 inhabitants, the last of which moved out in 1987. 60 percent of the inhabitants were Chinese, out of which 70 percent were Hakkas and 30 percent were Teochews, and 40 percent were Malays. There were a few Indians as well. The reason for Hakka being the majority of the Chinese population is that most of the Hokkien and Teochew businessmen already had flourishing businesses on the mainland. When the Hakkas arrived, they decided to make a living on an island less inhabited. Most were farmers, fishermen and shop owners selling sundry goods. Wild pigs and deer were once plentiful on Pulau Tekong, and attracted hunters from Singapore. Pulo Tekong Besar had undergone so much development after World War II, with vegetable, fruit and poultry farms, that the wildlife has mostly disappeared. Present Today, Pulau Tekong is used exclusively as a training base for various Singapore Army Units. Home to the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC), this is also where young Singaporean males are conscripted into National Service. The School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC), which was situated Rocky Hill Camp, relocated to a new campus at Pasir Laba Camp in December 2005. A new training area, called Sanyongkong Field Camp, has been completed on the reclaimed land south of Dogra Bridge. Built by the Combat Engineers, this field camp will be used to train Infantry and Guards battalions. It also provides habitat to some wild animals that are rarely seen in the main island Singapore such as the leopard cat, Sunda slow loris and Sunda pangolin. The extended Pulau Tekong will massively replace all training grounds, like Mandai, Marsiling, Seletar, Nee Soon, Lower Seletar, Upper Thomson and Simpang. The island also houses Singapore's second hot spring, Pulau Tekong Hot Spring in the former grounds of Kampung Unum. Pulau Tekong Besar is one of the island that is a training base for the various Singapore Army with another islands, Pulau Sudong, Pulau Pawai & Pulau Senang. Runaway elephants On May 29, 1990, national servicemen spotted a family of three Indian elephants which had swum across the Straits of Johor. The Singapore Zoo worked with the Malaysian Wildlife Department's Elephant Capture and Translocation Unit to help in its plan to recapture the runaway elephants. On June 10, all three elephants were captured and relocated back to the jungles of Johor. Land reclamation issues Land reclamation work is currently undergoing off the southern part of the island. Malaysia has referred the reclamation issue to International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in July 2003. Subsequently, the tribunal ordered a year-long joint study on the issue. The conflict was resolved in April 2005 following the signing of an agreement between the two countries. The agreement includes modifications of the island in \\"Area D\\". The signed agreement was sent to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for final judgment. Armed robbery incident In March 2004 Pulau Tekong was the hiding place for a group of armed robbers comprising two Indonesians and a Malaysian. The robbers had fled from Malaysia, sparking off a massive coordinated manhunt involving Air Force helicopters, commandos, ground surveillance radar, troops from the 2nd Singapore Infantry Regiment, troops from the 40th Singapore Armoured Regiment and the Singapore Police Force. All three were caught by police officers; two by members of the Gurkha Contingent and one by the Police Coast Guard's Special Task Squadron. They were later charged with illegal entry and possession of firearms. In popular culture In Singaporean folklore, the island is deemed to be extremely haunted. The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (now MediaCorp) Channel 8 drama \\"Son of Pulau Tekong\\" portrayed the lives of the inhabitants of Pulau Tekong before it was turned into a training area for the Singaporean military. It is unclear whether the folklore actually dates back to the days when Tekong was inhabited by civilians, or if the beliefs sprang up after the island was taken over as military territory. Coastal protection The National Biodiversity Centre and National Parks Board (NParks) will be conducting coastal protection and restoration works at the north-eastern coastline of Pulau Tekong which suffers from coastal erosion. The National Biodiversity Centre stated that the erosion resulted from the movements of ships and strong waves in the area. A study NParks commissioned in 2006 found that of the north-eastern shore is most severely affected. The coastal erosion poses a threat to the of mangroves in Pulau Tekong which is one of the largest remaining mangrove areas in Singapore with a mature and undisturbed habitat. Ecologists point out that the island is extremely rich in biodiversity and resident to some rare or endangered species,Victor R. Savage, Environment and Climate Change in Asia: Ecological Footprints and Green Prospects, 2012. including the Fern Dipteris conjugata.

The two bottles of lubricant are attached to the piston and move while the engine is operating. Lubrication is the process or technique of using a lubricant to reduce friction and wear and tear in a contact between two surfaces. The study of lubrication is a discipline in the field of tribology. Lubricants can be solids (such as molybdenum disulfide MoS2),http://www.engineersedge.com/lubrication/applications_solid_lubrication.htm ‚Äì 14k solid/liquid dispersions (such as grease), liquids (such as oil or water), liquid-liquid dispersions or gases. Fluid-lubricated systems are designed so that the applied load is partially or completely carried by hydrodynamic or hydrostatic pressure, which reduces solid body interactions (and consequently friction and wear). Depending on the degree of surface separation, different lubrication regimes can be distinguished. Adequate lubrication allows smooth, continuous operation of machine elements, reduces the rate of wear, and prevents excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, components can rub destructively against each other, causing heat, local welding, destructive damage and failure.  Lubrication mechanisms  Fluid-lubricated systems As the load increases on the contacting surfaces, three distinct situations can be observed with respect to the mode of lubrication, which are called lubrication regimes: *Fluid film lubrication is the lubrication regime in which, through viscous forces, the load is fully supported by the lubricant within the space or gap between the parts in motion relative to one another object (the lubricated conjunction) and solid‚Äìsolid contact is avoided.San Andr√©s. L. \\"Introduction to pump rotordynamics, Part i. Introduction to hydrodynamic lubrication\\". (\\"MEEN626 Lubrication Theory Class:Syllabus FALL2006\\"). (11 Dec 2007) **In hydrostatic lubrication, external pressure is applied to the lubricant in the bearing to maintain the fluid lubricant film where it would otherwise be squeezed out. **In hydrodynamic lubrication, the motion of the contacting surfaces, as well as the design of the bearing, pump lubricant around the bearing to maintain the lubricating film. This design of bearing may wear when started, stopped or reversed, as the lubricant film breaks down. The basis of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication is the Reynolds equation. The governing equations of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication and some analytical solutions can be found in the reference. *Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming surfaces or higher load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, the motion of the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness. *Boundary lubrication (also called boundary film lubrication): The hydrodynamic effects are negligible. The bodies come into closer contact at their asperities; the heat developed by the local pressures causes a condition which is called stick-slip, and some asperities break off. At the elevated temperature and pressure conditions, chemically reactive constituents of the lubricant react with the contact surface, forming a highly resistant tenacious layer or film on the moving solid surfaces (boundary film) which is capable of supporting the load and major wear or breakdown is avoided. Boundary lubrication is also defined as that regime in which the load is carried by the surface asperities rather than by the lubricant. *Mixed lubrication: This regime is in between the full film elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes. The generated lubricant film is not enough to separate the bodies completely, but hydrodynamic effects are considerable. Besides supporting the load the lubricant may have to perform other functions as well, for instance it may cool the contact areas and remove wear products. While carrying out these functions the lubricant is constantly replaced from the contact areas either by the relative movement (hydrodynamics) or by externally induced forces. Lubrication is required for correct operation of mechanical systems such as pistons, pumps, cams, bearings, turbines, cutting tools etc. where without lubrication the pressure between the surfaces in close proximity would generate enough heat for rapid surface damage which in a coarsened condition may literally weld the surfaces together, causing seizure. In some applications, such as piston engines, the film between the piston and the cylinder wall also seals the combustion chamber, preventing combustion gases from escaping into the crankcase. If an engine required pressurised lubrication to, say, plain bearings, there would be an oil pump and an oil filter. On early engines (such as a Sabb marine diesel), where pressurised feed was not required splash lubrication would suffice.

Biography Rupp grew up in West Germany with strong leftist political leanings. In 1968, as a student in Mainz, employment as a spy for the GDR was suggested to him, and he agreed out of conviction. He continued his studies in Brussels, was trained as a spy in East Berlin and was hired by NATO in 1977. He rose quickly in the ranks and provided photographs of some 10,000 pages to his controllers, including the precise location plans for the deployment of cruise missiles and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, as well as the central MC 161 document which summarized the NATO strategy as well as NATO's analysis of the Warsaw Pact and its intentions. These documents were promptly transferred to the KGB. He would photograph documents in his office, or take them home and photograph them in his wine cellar. He met contact persons all over Europe and received instructions via number stations, radio programs broadcasting messages encrypted as number sequences. His British wife knew about his activities and tried to persuade him to stop. He later said \\"At the time I did it, I believed it to be my moral duty.\\" NATO did not have any knowledge of the existence of Topaz until GDR officer Heinz Busch defected in 1990. Busch however did not know the identity of Topaz. Several meetings of the secret services of a number of countries ensued with the aim of identifying Topaz, who took part in some of those meetings. With the help of the Rosenholz files that had fallen into the hands of the CIA after the dissolution of the GDR, Rupp was caught in 1993, while on vacation in Germany. He confessed and received a prison sentence of 12 years in 1994. He was released early in July 2000. Rupp became a member of the PDS and served temporarily as an advisor in regard to issues of security and foreign policy; he quit the party, however, in 2003. Averted atomic war claim Rupp claims that his activities may have averted a nuclear war in the fall of 1983, a claim that is not entirely unfounded according to American experts. In an interview for the Channel 4 programme \\"1983: The Brink of Apocalypse\\", about exercise Able Archer 83, broadcast in the UK on 5 January 2008, he said that he had transmitted the message that NATO was not preparing to launch a surprise nuclear attack against the USSR during the exercise to his HVA controllers. He did this by way of encoding the message on a device disguised as a calculator which then turned the message into a short electronic burst which could be transmitted to a set telephone number. He viewed this as vital to preventing a Soviet pre-emptive strike against NATO forces. In the same program, Rupp said he was proud of the damage he did to NATO over the years of his intelligence activities.\\"1983 The Brink of Apocalypse\\" Channel 4 References # * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:West German spies for East Germany Category:People convicted of spying for East Germany Category:NATO personnel ","title":"Rainer Rupp"},{"id":"309225","text":"Arthurlie Football Club are a football team from Barrhead, East Renfrewshire in Scotland. Based at Dunterlie Park, they play in the West of Scotland Football League. The club played in the Scottish Football League in two spells, 1901 to 1915 and 1923 to 1929.Bob Crampsey (1990) The First 100 Years, Scottish Football League, p291 They have won the Scottish Junior Cup twice, in 1937 and 1998. History Arthurlie was founded in 1874 and played as a senior side until 1929. The club reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup in three consecutive seasons from 1880‚Äì81, with their 1883 tie with Kilmarnock Athletic taking four games to settle. A notable early result was a 4‚Äì2 defeat of Celtic in the first round of the 1896‚Äì97 Scottish Cup. Celtic avenged this defeat with a 7‚Äì0 victory in Barrhead at the same stage the following season and the two clubs met again in Arthurlie's last ever Scottish Cup tie to date in 1929, with the Glasgow side winning 5‚Äì1 at Celtic Park. With regard to league football, the club became a founder member of the Scottish Football Federation in 1891, winning that competition in its first year before joining the Scottish Football Alliance in 1893. Arthurlie obtained membership of the Scottish Football League in 1901 and achieved modest results in the Second Division, with a highest finish of joint second in 1906‚Äì07. That division ceased operations in 1915, during the First World War, but Arthurlie did not immediately rejoin the league after the war ended. They instead waited until 1923 to apply for membership of the newly created Third Division.Crampsey, p292 Arthurlie immediately won the Third Division championship, and four reasonably successful seasons in the Second Division followed. Financial problems forced the club to resign its membership of the league with six games of the 1928‚Äì29 season to play. As the club had played all the promotion-chasing clubs, their results were allowed to stand.Crampsey, p85 A club of the same name joined the Junior grade during the early 1930s. They found success quickly with a Scottish Junior Cup win in 1937 ‚Äì defeating Kirkintilloch Rob Roy 5‚Äì1 in the final in front of a crowd of 23,000 at Celtic Park. Two unsuccessful final appearances followed, against Fauldhouse United in 1946, then derby rivals Pollok in 1981, before they lifted the trophy again in 1998, taking revenge on Pollok with a 4‚Äì0 victory in the final at Fir Park with strikes from Mark McLaughlin, Johnny Millar, Steven Convery and Steven Nugent. In the Junior Super League era, the club were the first ever winners of the second tier West of Scotland Super League First Division in 2003 and enjoyed an unbroken 15 seasons in the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division until relegation to the newly configured SJFA West Region Championship in 2018. The club's most recent trophy success was in the 2015 West of Scotland Cup final, defeating Kilwinning Rangers 4‚Äì2 at Newlandsfield Park, with goals from Gary Smith (3), and Ryan McGregor. It was Arthurlie's sixth victory in the West of Scotland Cup, a feat equalled by Pollok in 2017 and only Auchinleck Talbot (12) and Irvine Meadow (9), have won the tournament more often. The team are managed by former Scotland Junior international defender, Duncan Sinclair, who joined the club from Larkhall Thistle in June 2018. Sinclair has also previously managed Shotts Bon Accord, Kilsyth Rangers and Lanark United. He is Arthurlie's ninth manager since 2010.

Goldratt, a business consultant known for his theory of constraints, and Jeff Cox, an author of multiple management-oriented novels. The Goal was originally published in 1984 and has since been revised and republished. This book can be used for case studies in operations management, with a focus geared towards the theory of constraints, bottlenecks and how to alleviate them, and applications of these concepts in real life.A summary of The Goal by Gower Publishing It is used in management colleges to teach students about the importance of strategic capacity planning and constraint management. Time Magazine listed the book as one of \\"The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books. Setting Like other books by Goldratt and by Cox, The Goal is written as a piece of fiction. The main character is Alex Rogo, who manages a production plant owned by UniCo Manufacturing, where everything is always behind schedule and things are looking dire. At the beginning of the book, Bill Peach, a company executive, tells Alex that he has three months to turn operations at his plant around from being unprofitable and unreliable to being successful.A chapter-by- chapter summary of The Goal His distant acquaintance, Jonah (a physicist), whom many believe represents Goldratt himself, helps him solve the company's problems through a series of telephone calls and short meetings. A second story line is introduced involving Alex's marital life. Perhaps surprisingly, Jonah's concepts are also applied successfully in this alternative story line. Bottlenecks The book goes on to point out the role of bottlenecks (constraints) in a manufacturing process, and how identifying them not only makes it possible to reduce their impact, but also yields a useful tool for measuring and controlling the flow of materials. Alex and his team identify the bottlenecks in their process and immediately begin to implement changes to help increase capacity and speed up production. In response to questions about the logic of using outdated technology in modern manufacturing, Alex's team brought in an old machine they received for free (which had previously been used at their plant in conjunction with two other machines) in order to increase the capacity of the NCX-10 machine, which had been identified as one of the two bottlenecks. Further more, they identified processes at the heat treat, identified as their second bottleneck, that caused massive delays in their getting product through the heat-treat and which had also caused some products to be heat-treated multiple times (to make softer and then harder again) instead of just once or not at all. Socratic method In the book, Jonah teaches Alex Rogo by using the Socratic method. Throughout the book, whenever a meeting or telephone call dialogue happens with Jonah, he poses a question to Alex Rogo or a member of his crew, which in turn causes them to talk amongst themselves to come up with a solution to their problem. When Alex Rogo is with his wife, he finds the Socratic method to be a way to fix his marriage, which he then uses, with his crew, to come up with the five steps they should use to fix problems in the plant, which ultimately leads him and Lou to think up the three things every division manager, the position Rogo is promoted to, should be able to do.

History The club was formed on Monday 4 June 1945 when a public meeting was held in the old wooden clubhouse at Brig O‚ÄôLea. Their first league game took place on Saturday 11 August 1945. It was an away match against Riccarton Bluebell and resulted in a 4‚Äì4 draw. Just two years after their formation, the club finished the 1946‚Äì47 season as the Western League North champions and also won the Western League Cup and the Renfrewshire Cup. Renfrew District Council took over Brig O‚ÄôLea Stadium in the early 1960s and built a new clubhouse and installed floodlights for season 1964‚Äì65. The new look stadium was opened on Monday 21 December 1964 when Neilston played Greenock Morton under the new floodlights. In 1967 they left the Western League to join the Central League and in their first season they finished runners-up to Petershill in the \\"B\\" Division. In season 1970‚Äì71 they were \\"C\\" Division Champions. 1995 was their 50th Anniversary year, and in all honestly the club could have folded but due to the hard work and determined efforts of everyone at the club they came through. On 6 October 1998 Neilston won their first major trophy in 51 years by defeating Ballieston 5‚Äì0 at Fir Park, Motherwell in the Beatons Sectional League Cup Final. Season 2002‚Äì03 saw Neilston narrowly come close to being crowned the first ever champions of the newly created West Super League Premier Division but they missed out on goal difference to Pollok. Season 2005‚Äì06 was their most successful for 50 years as they finished champions of the Stagecoach Super League First Division and won the Carlsberg Sectional League Cup against East Kilbride Thistle 4‚Äì3 on penalties after a 0‚Äì0 draw at Firhill Stadium to give the club a well deserved double. 2006‚Äì07 saw the club get to the quarter finals of the Scottish Junior Cup for only the fourth time in their history and finish in fourth place in the Stagecoach Super League Premier Division. Relegated at the end of 2008‚Äì09 from the Stagecoach Super League Premier The Farmer's Boys then suffered back to back relegations from the Stagecoach Super First Division to the Central District First Division.

History Formed in 1908 as an offshoot of Poloc Cricket ClubClub history, Poloc Cricket Club and based at a ground called Haggs Park within Pollok Estate until 1926, Pollok were one of many average clubs in Junior football in Glasgow. The club eventually rose to prominence upon the demise of Third Lanark in 1967 with many supporters opting to support Pollok, being in close proximity on the south side of Glasgow. Pollok eventually became champions of the Central League in 1978‚Äì79, and won their first major honour, the Scottish Junior Cup in 1980‚Äì81.

Since 2002 League Reconstruction Junior football in the west of Scotland was restructured in 2002, amalgamating the Central and Ayrshire leagues to form the West Region. Prior to this Pollok had been champions of the Central league eight times. The top league of the new set up was the West Premier League which Pollok have won four times. Beginning in the 2007‚Äì08 season the SFA began inviting the winners of the four major Junior honours (Scottish Junior Cup, West Premier League, East Super League, & North Premier League) to take part in the Senior Scottish Cup. Pollok were reigning champions of the West Premier League at the time, and took part in the 2007‚Äì08 Scottish Cup. In the 1st round 'Lok were drawn away against St Cuthbert Wanderers of the South of Scotland League. The match took place at St. Mary's Park, Kirkcudbright with Pollok winning comfortably by 6 goals to 2. Montrose of the Third Division were to be Pollok's opponents in the second round. Pollok performed admirably against the Scottish League club, achieving a 2‚Äì2 draw at Links Park. In the replay at Newlandsfield 'Lok were not as successful and lost 1‚Äì0. The following year saw Pollok once again crowned West Premier League Champions. At the start of the season they were eliminated in the second round from the 2008‚Äì09 Scottish Cup by Edinburgh-based East of Scotland team Spartans. At the end of the season Pollok had a chance once again to retain their West Premier League championship but lost the last league game of the season away to Auchinleck Talbot by failing to defend a 1‚Äì0 lead in the last eight minutes. Having exited the Scottish Junior Cup at the semi-final stage for the second year in a row, manager Jim Sinnett promptly resigned after the game. 2009‚Äì10 did not go well for Pollok with an early exit in the Scottish Junior Cup away to Newtongrange Star. In March 2010 manager Rab Sneddon resigned for work reasons and was succeeded by Willie Irvine. Season 2010‚Äì11 saw Pollok suffer a shock exit at home to Neilston Juniors in the Scottish Junior Cup. Season 2011‚Äì12 saw Pollok lose four of their opening seven league fixtures, prompting Willie Irvine to tender his resignation on Monday, 10 October 2011. His eventual replacement was John Richardson, who kept the club in the top flight after a relegation play-off against Renfrew. Season 2012‚Äì13 saw Pollok win both the Central Sectional League Cup and the Central League Cup as well as narrowly avoiding relegation for the second year running. Only three players were retained from the previous season for 2013‚Äì14. This season was a disaster for Pollok. The club was embroiled in many off field controversies and had four different managers throughout the season. Current manager, Tony McInally, was appointed in December 2013 but Pollok were finally relegated on 28 April 2014 with a 3‚Äì2 loss to Glenafton Athletic. Under McInally, Pollok were promoted as Champions the following season and won the Evening Times Champions Cup. The club reached the final of the 2015‚Äì16 Scottish Junior Cup but lost to Beith Juniors on penalty kicks after a 1‚Äì1 draw. In 2016, the club briefly received widespread media attention after right-back Tam Hanlon scored a hat-trick of long-range goals (two free kicks and one from open play) in a match against Neilston. The feat was captured on video and quickly went viral, being viewed millions of times and leading international players and pundits to praise the quality of the goals.  West of Scotland League  In 2020, Pollok moved from the SJFA, to join the pyramid system in Scottish football as one of the inaugural members of the West of Scotland Football League. On 11 October 2020, the club announced they would not be participating in the inaugural season of the West of Scotland League due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, citing safety of volunteers and players, and the financial impact on the club of pursuing a campaign with no matchday income, as the main reasons. Former players On settling the Intermediate dispute in 1931 Pollok sold the following players to senior football: J.McBride, J.Robertson and R.Griffiths to Chelsea; Charlie M. Thomson to Sunderland and T.Armstrong to Airdrieonians. Other Pollok players who have also played in the Scottish Football League or Football League include Brian Bilsland, Kevin Budinauckas, Ross O'Donoghue, Craig Cranmer and Danny Diver. Former Pollok striker Dougie Arnott achieved Scottish Cup success with Motherwell.Pollok FC player index (click on History/Past Players) In recent years, Pollok have had numerous players move up to senior level including John Sweeney ‚Äì Current Clyde Captain, Arbroath keeper Scott Morrison, Airdireonians assistant/player Paul Lovering, Albion Rovers defender Ross Dunlop and Dundee striker (now Zebbugg Rangers) Carlo Monti. Derek Lea played in all three of Pollok's junior cup final triumphs as a striker. Stadium Pollok play their home games at Newlandsfield Park in the Newlands area of Glasgow, a ground they have used since the 1928‚Äì29 season. The stadium has a capacity of 4,000 (1,500 covered), and is largely terracing. Pollok's first ground was at Haggs Park in the Pollok Estate, but they were forced to move out in 1926‚Äì27 as Glasgow City Council wanted the land for school pitches. After playing temporarily at Rosebery Park and the Queen Mary Tea Gardens at Speirsbridge (in Thornliebank), they acquired Newlandsfield Park, which has been their ground ever since.Pollok FC History Current squad } Development squad  Coaching staff  {  - !Role !Name - Manager Murdo MacKinnon - Assistant Manager Billy McGhie - Coach Ian Penman - Goalkeeping Coach Billy Kerr - Physio Hannah Miller - Development Squad Manager Stephen McKenna - Development Squad Assistant Chris Ferguson } Honours Scottish Junior Cup *Winners: 1980‚Äì81, 1984‚Äì85, 1996‚Äì97 *Runners-up: 1985‚Äì86, 1997‚Äì98, 2015‚Äì16 SJFA West Premier League *Winners: 2002‚Äì03, 2004‚Äì05, 2006‚Äì07, 2007‚Äì08 SJFA West Super First Division *Winners: 2014‚Äì15 Other honours *West of Scotland Cup winners: 1944‚Äì45, 1986‚Äì87, 1991‚Äì92, 1997‚Äì98, 1999‚Äì2000, 2016‚Äì17 *SJFA Supercup: 2003‚Äì04, 2005‚Äì06 *Central League Premier Division winners: 1984‚Äì85, 1985‚Äì86, 1986‚Äì87, 1990‚Äì91, 1994‚Äì95, 1995‚Äì96 *Central League champions: 1978‚Äì79, 1980‚Äì81 *Central League A Division winners: 1980‚Äì81 *Central League B Division winners: 1968‚Äì69, 1978‚Äì79 *Glasgow Junior Cup: 1941‚Äì42, 1953‚Äì54, 1961‚Äì62 *Glasgow Dryburgh Cup: 1930‚Äì31, 1941‚Äì42, 1948‚Äì49 *Central League Cup: 1977‚Äì78, 1979‚Äì80, 1983‚Äì84, 1987‚Äì88, 1989‚Äì90, 2004‚Äì05, 2008‚Äì09, 2010‚Äì11, 2012‚Äì13, 2015‚Äì16, 2017‚Äì18 *Central Sectional League Cup: 1983‚Äì84, 1987‚Äì88, 1990‚Äì91, 1992‚Äì93, 1996‚Äì97, 1999‚Äì2000, 2003‚Äì04, 2006‚Äì07, 2012‚Äì13 *Evening Times Cup Winners Cup: 1983‚Äì84, 1984‚Äì85, 1985‚Äì86, 1987‚Äì88, 2003‚Äì04, 2006‚Äì07, 2007‚Äì08, 2014‚Äì15 Notable players These players have achieved success playing for teams in the Senior leagues. *Dougie Arnott ‚Äì Motherwell *Fraser Wishart ‚Äì Motherwell, St Mirren, Rangers, Motherwell *Stuart Gordon ‚Äì Hamilton Academical *Gary Clark ‚Äì Falkirk, Sliema Wanderers, Hamilton Academical *Ian Spittal ‚Äì Partick Thistle, Stranraer, Clyde *Robert Prytz ‚Äì Malm√∂, Rangers, Sweden *Bobby Collins ‚Äì Celtic, Everton, Leeds United, Scotland *Sandy Stewart ‚Äì Hearts *Danny Diver ‚Äì Kolding IF, RC Tournai, Ayr United, Hamilton Academical *Chic Charnley ‚Äì Hamilton Academical, Djurg√•rdens IF, Partick Thistle, Bolton Wanderers, Hibernian *Andy McLaren - Dundee United, Reading,Kilmarnock References External links *Official website *Fans forum Category:Association football clubs established in 1908 Category:Football clubs in Scotland Category:Scottish Junior Football Association clubs Category:Football clubs in Glasgow Category:1908 establishments in Scotland Category:Pollokshaws Category:West of Scotland Football League teams ","title":"Pollok F.C."},{"id":"309233","text":"Troon Football Club (also known as The Seasiders or The Seagulls) are a Scottish football team based in Ayrshire. They compete in the West of Scotland Football League. Formed in 1946, they are based at Portland Park in the town of Troon in Ayrshire. The ground has a current capacity of 2,000 and is standing only. The club's colours are blue and black vertical stripes, similar to that of Inter Milan. History Beginnings of football in Troon Despite Troon being synonymous with golf, there are records to the effect that local football has a history which began approximately three years before the golf course at the end of the South Beach was ever considered. Troon Portland As far back as 1875 there was a Troon Portland football team, reckoned as seniors, though most of their matches were of necessity friendlies since no leagues of any kind were then available. But they did play clubs such as Irvine, Irvine Victoria, Ayr, Kilmarnock Athletic, Kilmarnock Portland and other county teams. The first Troon Portland team was as follows: Goal, Frank Briggs, Backs, Charles Fullarton, David Connell, and Hugh Allison; Half backs, Robert Hastings and James Connell; Forwards. Reuben McNeillage. John Kennan, James Murchie, William Cunningham, John Johnstone. Robert Smith. and David Johnstone.http://www.ladyisle.com/tp%2062.htm Troon Academicals The first proper football club in Troon first came into being in 1889, when Troon Academicals (together with 23 other clubs) became members of the first ever Ayrshire Junior Football Association. That Troon side won the Irvine and District Cup in 1891‚Äì92 and again in 1894‚Äì95. Two of their players, D. Boyd and T. Walker, played as a left wing for Scotland against England. The Troon Academicals name was reborn in 2009 by a Troon F.C. affiliated supporters team of the same name. Troon Rangers In 1904‚Äì05 the Ayrshire Consolation Cup was won by a Junior team named Troon Rangers. Troon Athletic Troon Athletic were founded in 1919 by the Troon Federation of ex-Servicemen with a committee headed by Tom Wallace (President) William Noble (Treasurer) and William S. Elliot (Secretary). Their home ground was at the public park in Troon from the Station Hill to the Yorke Road Bridge. Troon Athletic joined the Kilmarnock and District Junior League, winning it at the first attempt in the 1920‚Äì21 season. Their first team was as follows ;‚Äì S. Elliott, W. Kettle, and A. Hendry; P. McAdam, G. Elliott, and H. Murdoch; J. Wright and J. Hillditch; A. Howie: J. McLean and R. Hunter. In 1921‚Äì22, and now playing in the stronger Western league, they finished in seventh place out of nineteen clubs. the Scottish Cup saw a run to the sixth round, which was then the stage of the last sixteen clubs in the competition. Fellow Ayrshiremen, and eventual Cup winners, Kilwinning Rangers put an end to the Cup dream. However, the won the Ayrshire Junior Cup when over three thousand people watching them defeat Ardeer Thistle 2‚Äì1 at Rugby Park, home of Kilmarnock Football Club. In 1924 the Ayrshire Consolation Cup came to town, after a 3‚Äì0 defeat of Cumnock. Another two years passed and Athletic were again in the running for honours. Semi-finalists in the Western League Cup and Ayrshire Consolation Cup, finalists in the Irvine & District Cup, and in the last sixteen of the Scottish Cup, it was a season of near misses. In the Scottish Cup, they had their record win in the trophy, with a second round 11‚Äì4 win against Glasgow Highlanders, but Renfrew put the run to an end. The four seasons in the Intermediates was relatively successful, winning the Ayrshire Intermediates Cup (1928‚Äì29) and the Gold Watch competition (1929‚Äì30) as well as being finalists in the 1930‚Äì31 Stirling Trophy. In 1935, Saltcoats Victoria defeated Athletic by a convincing four goals to nil in the final of the West of Scotland Consolation Cup, whilst 1936 saw their final piece of silverware won, in the shape of the Ayrshire Consolation Cup, with a 4‚Äì3 win against Kilbirnie Ladeside. Second World War As with most levels of football, Junior football was suspended during the period of the Second World War of 1939‚Äì1945, and Troon Athletic closed down for good in 1940 as many of the players and officials were involved in Air Raid patrols or working overtime in the local shipyard, with insufficient time to run a football club. Troon Juniors formed After the Second World War, Junior football reformed and the people of Troon grasped the opportunity of a new dawn in Scottish football in the post-war era. Troon Juniors, a brand new club, was established in 1946 at the newly constructed Portland Park, a purpose built stadium to give the club the opportunity to progress in Scottish football. Troon Juniors played in the Western League North Section but the first few years saw little of any note, with league form being poor and usually ending in a lowly position. By 1953‚Äì54, the years of waiting finally bore some fruit, with sixth place achieved in the Western League, only four points behind Champions Irvine Meadow. Winners in the Land O'Burns Cup (4‚Äì0 against Kilbirnie Ladeside) and finalists in the Ayrshire Junior Cup, there was something to cheer the fans. To round off a good season, the fifth round of the Scottish Cup was reached, before losing 3‚Äì0 to Clydebank Juniors. The fourth round saw unusual opposition in Argyll side Lochgilphead, who were routed by four goals to one. In 1955‚Äì56, as well as getting to the semi-finals of the two cups they had reached the final of two years earlier, a final placing of 5th in the league, though nineteen points off the top, was their best to date. After this, it was back to almost obscurity for a decade, with early exits and poor league form the norm. The mid-1960s saw a brief improvement, with the first semi-final appearance in a decade (in the Western League Cup) and the following season they ended as second in the league and semi-finalists of the West of Scotland Cup. The Western League was disbanded in 1968, when Junior football was regionalised and The Ayrshire Region of the Scottish Junior Football Association was formed. We had our first taste of international recognition in 1969 when Gordon Armstrong was capped by Scotland at both Junior and Amateur level in successive weeks, playing in both matches against Wales. Troon Juniors played in the Ayrshire League Northern Section until season 1976‚Äì77 when the Sectional formation was abandoned. This was replaced by two Divisions with Troon Juniors being assigned to the Second. Troon Football Club After 1977 the term \\"Juniors\\" was dropped from the club title, which was the fourth occasion in the history of football in Troon that the town‚Äôs Junior club changed its name. From then on it was simply known as \\"Troon Football Club\\" and it was around this time that black and blue vertical stripes first appeared on the club shirts, and they have remained to this day. At the end of the 1985‚Äì86 season, promotion to the First Division of the Ayrshire League (which had been formed upon the dissolution of the Western League in 1969) was attained, and although relegated at the end of the season, they reached the semi-finals of the Ayrshire Sectional League Cup. Troon F.C. languished in the Second Division of Ayrshire Junior Football until 1997 when after a long spell of mediocrity, Manager John Redmond led the club to the Ayrshire Second Division Championship trophy & promotion to the Ayrshire Division 1. Super League era In 2002 the new West of Scotland Region was formed and Super Leagues introduced. Troon F.C. started off that new era for Junior football in the Super League First Division and in the inaugural season, Troon F.C. finished in second place winning promotion to the Premier Division. They played in the top flight for two seasons but were relegated at the end of the second despite winning their first major honour, the West of Scotland Cup, and having their best ever run in the Scottish Junior Cup. The next three seasons were spent in the First Division where success mainly eluded the Portland Parkers. Management teams changed and season 2007‚Äì08 ended with Troon being relegated to the Ayrshire District League. Kirkwood regime In 2010 the Kirkwood family took an interest in Troon and were appointed on to the committee of the club. Jim Kirkwood Snr. was appointed as Chairman, Alasdair Kirkwood as club Treasurer and Jimmy Kirkwood Jnr. as a committee member and Assistant Manager under John Redmond. The fortunes of the club improved almost immediately as an improved professionalism and business nous saw investment in the club infrastructure. The social club at Portland Park was renovated and expanded, and investment on the playing surface itself allowed an improvement in the style of play encouraged by the new coaching staff. Jimmy Kirkwood took over as Manager in March 2011, assisted by former Troon player Gordon Burns, and an overhaul of the playing squad commenced with an emphasis on youth development & attractive football. Results were erratic to begin with, but the team missed out on the second promotion spot by one point. The club went one better in 2012‚Äì13, securing second place with weeks to spare after a season long title battle with Kilwinning Rangers and promotion back to the Super League was assured. Further investment off the park saw upgraded dressing rooms, an outside area beside the social club and expanded terracing areas on the homes side. In season 2013‚Äì14 the club were crowned the Super League First Division Champions, Ayrshire Cup winners and were also West of Scotland Cup finalists. In the summer of 2015, work commitments saw Jimmy Kirkwood take a sideways step to become General Manager and was replaced by Gordon Burns as Troon Manager. A long unbeaten run saw Troon push for the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division title, before eventually finishing fourth in the 2015-16 season. The following season was a disaster for the club as a poor season throughout saw the club finish bottom of the Premier League and relegated to the Super League First Division. Manager Gordon Burns resigned at the end of the season and was replaced by Jimmy Kirkwood for a second spell as Manager. Under the returning Jimmy Kirkwood, Troon won promotion at the first time of asking via the play-offs after victory against Girvan to take their place in the newly formed SJFA West Premiership. End of the Junior era In early 2020, clubs voted to leave the Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region in favour of joining the West of Scotland Football League which was now part of the Scottish Football Pyramid.

Former Troon player Jim Stewart was included in Scotland's 1974 FIFA World Cup squad just two years after leaving the club for Kilmarnock. He was eventually capped twice by Scotland, against Chile in 1977 and Norway in 1978. Home ground Ground history Before moving into the new modernised facility beside the seafront, Troon Academicals F.C. had spent most of their existence (from 1889 until 1923) playing at Station Park before Portland Park was constructed. In 1923, it was demolished and replaced with the clubhouse and car park for Troon Links Golf Course. When Portland Park was first opened, players changing areas and toilets were located within the old wooden clubhouse which was destroyed by an accidental fire in the late 1970s. The current clubhouse was built in 1980, along with new turnstiles and a toilet block, although the dressing room area of the pavilion was extended in the mid-2000s. Floodlights were installed at Portland Park during February 1997 but were removed after storm damage during 2007. Facilities The stadium consists of four sides, and can accommodate up to 2,000 spectators for a match. The clubhouse side is host to the majority of the crowd and has a covered, terraced enclosure which can hold up to 200 spectators. There is also a wide terraced area in front of the clubhouse and behind the \\"Home\\" dug-out, which has a viewing area with a clear view of the pitch. The \\"Cop End\\" is located behind one of the goals and has the other main spectator's terrace in Portland Park. The area behind the far away goal is home to the floodlit training park, which is typically used on matchday for pre-match warm-ups to preserve the pitch, but the area immediately behind the goalposts has been earmarked for a new terracing area. As with most non-league grounds there is no segregation, however away supporters typically watch from behind the \\"Away\\" dugout on the railway side of the park facing the clubhouse where two steps of new terracing was created in early 2013. The ground has two main turnstiles, both of which are located off Portland Street. There is a snack bar to the side of the pavilion offering a wide range of hot and cold food, and the social club (with a licensed bar) is located inside the pavilion welcoming both home and away support. A new hospitality room, the Legend's Lounge, was created in the summer of 2018 for matchday hospitality. Tenants The very first tenants of Portland Park were Troon Athletic who opened the ground in 1923 and played here until the outbreak of Second World War saw their closure in 1940. Troon F.C. have called Portland Park home since their formation ahead of the 1946‚Äì47 season right up to present day, but other teams have utilised Portland Park on a regular basis. Since their founding in 2013, the Troon Under-19 side have used Portland Park for the majority of their home matches and between 2004-12 Troon Ladies were also based at Portland, playing their matches on a Sunday afternoon. An amateur side called Troon Academicals F.C., consisting of Troon F.C. supporters, played their matches on a Saturday morning at Portland Park between 2009 and 2012 before investment in the playing surface saw non-Troon F.C. participation on the park reduced as a preventative measure. The first non-football activity seen at Portland Park was when American Football side West Coast Trojans took up residence in 2011. With games taking place on a Sunday, the Trojans stayed for two seasons, moving to Glasgow.

Youth Academy Troon's first ever youth team were launched in the early 1980s, with the introduction of the Dundonald Thistle teams to the club. The youth initiative was relaunched in 2013 when former Dundee United star Neil Duffy was appointed as head coach of a new Under 19 team, under the watchful eye of Manager Jimmy Kirkwood. The target for this Under-19 team was to provide a platform for young players to learn and grow before making the step up to compete for a place in the Junior side. The Troon Football Club Youth Academy (TFCYA) was propelled as a priority upon the appointment of Jamie McCulloch as Head of Youth in 2018, working alongside Jonny McTear in recruitment. A flood of new players were recruited for the Development Team, and over the next two years new teams were introduced at 2003, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 age groups. Troon Development Squad (2001 Team) Troon formed their first Development Squad in the summer of 2013 to be led by Head Coach Neil Duffy. A first season was very successful with two trophies being won, before the team lifted every single trophy they competed for in 2014‚Äì15. Captain Morgan Brown was subsequently signed up by Troon F.C. to make the step up alongside left-back Ben Wilson and midfielder Ross McCrea, whilst fellow midfielders Sean Ewart and Louis Kerr joined Whitletts Victoria. Forward Dean Fulton was to join the first team later, after a spell with Stranraer. Manager Neil Duffy also stepped up to help out with the first team,http://troonfc.com/news/new-management-structure/ before leaving only a few months later http://troonfc.com/news/neil-duffy-moves-on/ to take over as Manager of Whitletts Victoria. In season 2015‚Äì16 Troon F.C. absorbed Troon Thistle's Under-17s as they made the step up to Under-19 level, under the tutelage of Derek Cowan & Henry McAvoy and in June 2017 Justin Brown was appointed Head Coach to oversee the transition for the new intake of players for the 2000 born players. Jamie McCulloch was appointed in June 2018 to head up the new-look 2000-aged team before introducing the 2001 age group, before he & Jonny McTear departed with all their players for Irvine Meadow in the summer of 2020. Partick Thistle Captain Thomas O'Ware was appointed as the new Development Team Head Coach in August 2020 to oversee our movement into the new Lowland Development League (West). Players from the WOSYFL table-topping Irvine United, which had disbanded at the end of last season, joined the TFCYA as part of the new Development Team. 2003 Team Troon formed a 2003 team in the summer of 2019, when the remaining players from Dalrymple & Coylton youth teams combined to make a strong side, under the stewardship of Bryan Martin. 2004 Team In April 2017, Troon F.C. announced plans for a new 2004 team which was to be headed by Brian Prentice. Local players were recruited and a coaching staff of Paul McDougall and Graeme Hadden were appointed, alongside club Secretary Kevin Hunter. Former Troon forward David Gillies took over the team in 2019 before departing for Irvine Meadow the following summer. Former Irvine Victoria goalkeeper Jim Catterson took over as head coach. 2008 Team The Dundonald Boys Club side, headed by Ed Vorsterman & former Troon winger Bryan \\"Homer\\" Mitchell, joined the TFCYA to form the new 2008 team in 2018. However, this team was disbanded in early 2020. 2011 Team Darren Sneddon approached the TFCYA about setting up a new 2011 team in the summer of 2019. 2013 Team A grassroots 2013 was set-up in early 2019 by Jamie McCulloch and later taken over by Russell Smith, son of former Class 1 Referee Dougie Smith. 2015 Team A grassroots 2015 was set-up in early 2020, which was taken over by Evan Martin upon McCulloch's departure. Troon Ladies F.C. Troon Ladies were formed in 2004 to further women's football in Troon and surrounding areas. The club also played their home matches at Portland Park. Troon Ladies F.C. won the 3rd Division South in season 2007/08 to gain promotion to the Scottish Women's Football League First Division and representing the club at the higher echelons of Ladies football. At the end of season 2012, Troon Ladies F.C. merged with Glasgow Girls and assumed the latter name, playing out of Budhill Park near Shettleston. Club colours and crest Previous Troon-based teams from the pre-war period played in plain blue, red or black, but when Troon F.C. were founded in 1946 they wore a red bodied strip with white collar and sleeves, white shorts and socks with red trim. During the 1960s, they wore white tops and black shorts for a spell, before a radical change to an all maroon kit from the late 1960s until 1977 when the club became known as simply \\"Troon Football Club\\". It was at this point when blue first entered the strip, initially as the main chest colour in a similar style to the original kit from 1946. Red & white hoops with blue shorts were worn from 1988-90 before blue and black stripes became the main jersey colours in the early nineties and have remained ever since, although red has continued to be utilised as a change strip in homage to the original strips.

After this date, the club used the Troon town coat of arms as an identity only, before an official club badge was introduced in 1977 when the term \\"Juniors\\" was dropped from the club's official title and Troon F.C. was born. Introduced by John Oliver, the badge bore a significant resemblance to the Burgh of Troon coat of arms with the inclusion of footballs. The badge was displayed in the clubhouse, depicted on a plaque made many years ago in the workshops at the Troon shipyard. The club badge did not actually make it on to the shirts until as late as season 2005‚Äì06, initially appearing as a coloured shield and latterly as a hollow symbol. Matchday programme In season 1981‚Äì82 \\"The Portland Parker\\" was released, and was the work of programme editor and Troon F.C. committee member John Oliver until 1996. Local photographer John B.

Microbiotheriids were once thought to be members of the order Didelphimorphia (which contains the Virginia opossum); however, an accumulation of both anatomical and genetic evidence in recent years has led to the conclusion that microbiotheriids and other microbiotheres are not didelphids at all, but are instead most closely related to the Australasian marsupials; together, the microbiotheres and the Australian orders form the clade Australidelphia which are now thought to have first evolved in the South American region of Gondwana. Biogeography The oldest microbiotheriid and microbiothere currently recognised is Khasia cordillerensis, based on fossil teeth from Early Palaeocene deposits at Tiupampa, Bolivia. Numerous genera are known from various Palaeogene and Neogene fossil sites in South America. A number of possible microbiotheres, again represented by isolated teeth, have also been recovered from the Middle Eocene La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island, Western Antarctica. Finally, several undescribed microbiotheres have been reported from the Early Eocene Tingamarra Local Fauna in northeastern Australia; if this is indeed the case, then these Australian fossils have important implications for understanding marsupial evolution and biogeography. The distant ancestors of the monito del monte, it is thought, remained in what is now South America while others entered Antarctica and eventually Australia during the time when all three continents were joined as part of Gondwana.

The only species to survive into modern times was the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), which became extinct in 1936. The consensus on placement of the family is with the Dasyuromorphia order, with agreement on the divergence this family and the Dasyuridae, represented by the extant quolls and Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii, remaining under consideration. The thylacinid family was represented by two species in a synonymy published in 1982, the recently extinct Tasmanian tiger and the species Thylacinus potens, known by fossil material. Discoveries of new material, especially in well researched fossil depositions at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, revealed a diverse array of genera and families existing during Miocene epoch. The dentition of specimens and some largely complete crania showed the development of specialist predators capable of hunting and consuming a range of vertebrate species, and like other mammalian predators, such as the canid family, could include herbivores larger than themselves. An assessment of the size range of the species has provided evidence of animals occupying a greater number of trophic levels and challenged the conception of the dominance of reptilians as large hyper- carnivorous predators on the Australia continent. The consensus of authors prior to 1982 was that the thylacinid family were related to the borhyaenidae, a group of South American predators, also extinct, that exhibited many similar characteristics of dentition. A review published in 1982 compared the skeletal structure of these groups, concluding the tarsal bones show greater affinity with the dasyurmorphs, strongly supporting the later theory that any dental similarities emerged independently. Another family, the Thylacoleonidae, were also large carnivorous marsupials, but allied to the order Vombatiformes and assumed to have also evolutionarily converged as predators of large herbivores.

The order is thought to have diverged from the ancestral marsupial line very early. They were once included in the superorder but it is now known that Ameridelphia is paraphyletic, having given rise to Australidelphia, and thus could be considered an evolutionary grade. Genetic studies indicate that they are the second most basal order of marsupials, after the didelphimorphs. As recently as 20 million years ago, at least seven genera were in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the High Andes. Shrews were entirely absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are currently present only in the northwestern part of the continent. Traditionally, it was thought that shrew opossums lost ground to these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Evidence suggests, however, that both groups not only overlap, but do not seem to be in direct competition, and the marsupials' larger size seems to imply that they prey on shrews and rodents. Several opossums, such as Monodelphis, also occupy small insectivore niches. Shrew opossums (also known as rat opossums or caenolestids) are about the size of a small rat (9-14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely carnivorous, being active hunters of insects, earthworms, and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in burrows and on surface runways. Like several other marsupials, they do not have a pouch, and it appears that females do not carry the young constantly, possibly leaving them in the burrow.Patterson (2008), page 126 Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known and have traditionally been considered rare. Several ecological factors, including density of forest, contribute to the part of the forests the shrew opossums occupy. Recent studies suggest they may be more common than had been thought. Their karyotype has also been described through contemporary research in order to better understand this organism.  Classification  Within the family of the Caenolestidae, seven extant species are known: * Genus Caenolestes ** Gray- bellied caenolestid, Caenolestes caniventer ** Andean caenolestid, Caenolestes condorensis ** Northern caenolestid, Caenolestes convelatus ** Dusky caenolestid, Caenolestes fuliginosus ** Eastern caenolestid, Caenolestes sangay * Genus Lestoros ** Peruvian or Incan caenolestid, Lestoros inca * Genus Rhyncholestes ** Long-nosed caenolestid, Rhyncholestes raphanurus However, Bublitz suggested in 1987 there were actually two Lestoros and Rhyncholestes species (those listed here plus L. gracilis and R. continentalis).

Its pyramidal form, as seen from the A82 road when travelling towards Glen Coe, makes it one of the most recognisable mountains in Scotland, and one of the most depicted on postcards and calendars. Buachaille Etive M√≤r takes the form of a ridge nearly five miles (8 km) in length, almost entirely encircled by the River Etive and its tributaries. The ridge contains four principal tops: from north-east to south-west these are Stob Dearg (1021.4 m), Stob na Doire (1011 m), Stob Coire Altruim (941 m) and Stob na Br√≤ige (956 m). Stob Dearg and Stob na Br√≤ige are both Munros; the latter was promoted to Munro status by the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1997. Ascent The steep, craggy north- eastern face of Stob Dearg forms the classic aspect of the mountain as seen from the Kings House Hotel, and constitutes the most direct route of ascent for climbers and scramblers. Crowberry Ridge, a classic rock climb graded severe, was first climbed direct - and photographed - in 1900 by the Abraham brothers with Messrs Puttrell and Baker. Immediately to the left is Curved Ridge, one of the most famous scrambling routes. Alternatively there is a somewhat eroded path leading steeply up the Coire na Tulaich which, in summer conditions, allows walkers to ascend the peaks, reaching the ridge about half a kilometre west of Stob Dearg. Buachaille Etive M√≤r is separated from its sister mountain of Buachaille Etive Beag to the west by the valley of Lairig Gartain. To the east lies Glen Etive, which provides an alternative route of ascent, heading up steep grassy slopes to the summit of Stob na Br√≤ige. Another route follows the Allt Coire Altruim from the Lairig Gartain, reaching the ridge about two thirds of the way along from the north. This route is often used as descent route in conjunction with an ascent via Coire na Tulaich, forming a circular route with a walk out along the Lairig Gartain. On 24 January 2009, three mountain climbers were killed and one was seriously injured in an avalanche. Lagangarbh Hut Buachaille Etive M√≤r from the A82, showing Lagangarbh Hut in the lower left The only building in the vicinity of Buachaille Etive M√≤r is Lagangarbh Hut, popularly referred to as a cottage on account of its appearance. It sits at the foot of Buachaille Etive M√≤r, adjacent to the River Coupall, and near the A82. It is owned by the National Trust, and managed by the Scottish Mountaineering Club, who make it available to hire as accommodation; up to 30 people can be accommodated. In popular culture Buachaille Etive M√≤r appears in the background during a song sequence in the 1998 Bollywood film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Together with Beinn a'Chrulaiste it can also be seen in the film Skyfall, where James Bond transports M away from the villain Raoul Silva.

Payload fraction is calculated by dividing the weight of the payload by the takeoff weight of aircraft. Fuel represents a considerable amount of the overall takeoff weight, and for shorter trips it is quite common to load less fuel in order to carry a lighter load. For this reason the useful load fraction calculates a similar number, but based on the combined weight of the payload and fuel together. Propeller-driven airliners had useful load fractions on the order of 25-35%. Modern jet airliners have considerably higher useful load fractions, on the order of 45-55%. For spacecraft the payload fraction is often less than 1%, while the useful load fraction is perhaps 90%. In this case the useful load fraction is not a useful term, because spacecraft typically can't reach orbit without a full fuel load. For this reason the related term propellant mass fraction, is used instead. However, if the latter is large, the payload can only be small.

Unlike fluorescence, a phosphorescent material does not immediately re-emit the radiation it absorbs. The slower time scales of the re-emission are associated with \\"forbidden\\" energy state transitions in quantum mechanics. As these transitions occur very slowly in certain materials, absorbed radiation is re-emitted at a lower intensity for up to several hours after the original excitation. Everyday examples of phosphorescent materials are the glow-in-the-dark toys, stickers, paint, wristwatch and clock dials that glow after being charged with a bright light such as in any normal reading or room light. Typically, the glow slowly fades out, sometimes within a few minutes or up to a few hours in a dark room.Karl A. Franz, Wolfgang G. Kehr, Alfred Siggel, J√ºrgen Wieczoreck, and Waldemar Adam \\"Luminescent Materials\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Around 1604, Vincenzo Casciarolo discovered a \\"lapis solaris\\" near Bologna, Italy. Once heated in an oxygen- rich furnace, it thereafter absorbed sunlight and glowed in the dark. The study of phosphorescent materials led to the discovery of radioactive decay. Explanations Simple Jablonski diagram of an energy scheme used to explain the difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence. The excitation of molecule A to its singlet excited state (1A*)is followed by intersystem crossing to the triplet state (3A) that relaxes to the ground state by phosphorescence. In simple terms, phosphorescence is a process in which energy absorbed by a substance is released relatively slowly in the form of light. This is in some cases the mechanism used for \\"glow-in-the-dark\\" materials which are \\"charged\\" by exposure to light. Unlike the relatively swift reactions in fluorescence, such as those seen in a common fluorescent tube, phosphorescent materials \\"store\\" absorbed energy for a longer time, as the processes required to re-emit energy occur less often. Quantum mechanical After an electron absorbs a photon of high energy, it may undergo vibrational relaxations and intersystem crossing to another spin state. Again the system relaxes vibrationally in the new spin state and eventually emits light by phosphorescence. Most photoluminescent events, in which a chemical substrate absorbs and then re-emits a photon of light, are fast, in the order of 10 nanoseconds. Light is absorbed and emitted at these fast time scales in cases where the energy of the photons involved matches the available energy states and allowed transitions of the substrate. In the special case of phosphorescence, the electron which absorbed the photon (energy) undergoes an unusual intersystem crossing into an energy state of different (usually higher) spin multiplicity (see term symbol), usually a triplet state. As a result, the excited electron can become trapped in the triplet state with only \\"forbidden\\" transitions available to return to the lower energy singlet state. These transitions, although \\"forbidden\\", will still occur in quantum mechanics but are kinetically unfavored and thus progress at significantly slower time scales. Most phosphorescent compounds are still relatively fast emitters, with triplet lifetimes in the order of milliseconds. However, some compounds have triplet lifetimes up to minutes or even hours, allowing these substances to effectively store light energy in the form of very slowly degrading excited electron states. If the phosphorescent quantum yield is high, these substances will release significant amounts of light over long time scales, creating so-called \\"glow-in-the-dark\\" materials. Equation :S_0 + h u \\\\to S_1 \\\\to T_1 \\\\to S_0 + h u^\\\\prime\\\\ where S is a singlet and T a triplet whose subscripts denote states (0 is the ground state, and 1 the excited state). Transitions can also occur to higher energy levels, but the first excited state is denoted for simplicity. Chemiluminescence Some examples of glow-in-the-dark materials do not glow by phosphorescence. For example, glow sticks glow due to a chemiluminescent process which is commonly mistaken for phosphorescence. In chemiluminescence, an excited state is created via a chemical reaction. The light emission tracks the kinetic progress of the underlying chemical reaction. The excited state will then transfer to a dye molecule, also known as a sensitizer or fluorophor, and subsequently fluoresce back to the ground state. Materials Common pigments used in phosphorescent materials include zinc sulfide and strontium aluminate. Use of zinc sulfide for safety related products dates back to the 1930s. However, the development of strontium aluminate, with a luminance approximately 10 times greater than zinc sulfide, has relegated most zinc sulfide based products to the novelty category. Strontium aluminate based pigments are now used in exit signs, pathway marking, and other safety related signage.Zitoun, D.; Bernaud, L.; Manteghetti, A.

One approach to simplification is to assume that the data of interest lie on an embedded non- linear manifold within the higher-dimensional space. If the manifold is of low enough dimension, the data can be visualised in the low-dimensional space. Top-left: a 3D dataset of 1000 points in a spiraling band (a.k.a. the Swiss roll) with a rectangular hole in the middle. Top-right: the original 2D manifold used to generate the 3D dataset. Bottom left and right: 2D recoveries of the manifold respectively using the LLE and Hessian LLE algorithms as implemented by the Modular Data Processing toolkit. Below is a summary of some of the important algorithms from the history of manifold learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR).John A. Lee, Michel Verleysen, Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction, Springer, 2007. Many of these non-linear dimensionality reduction methods are related to the linear methods listed below. Non-linear methods can be broadly classified into two groups: those that provide a mapping (either from the high-dimensional space to the low- dimensional embedding or vice versa), and those that just give a visualisation. In the context of machine learning, mapping methods may be viewed as a preliminary feature extraction step, after which pattern recognition algorithms are applied. Typically those that just give a visualisation are based on proximity data ‚Äì that is, distance measurements. Related Linear Decomposition Methods * Independent component analysis (ICA). * Principal component analysis (PCA) (also called Karhunen-Lo√®ve transform -- KLT). * Singular value decomposition (SVD). * Factor analysis.  Applications of NLDR  Consider a dataset represented as a matrix (or a database table), such that each row represents a set of attributes (or features or dimensions) that describe a particular instance of something. If the number of attributes is large, then the space of unique possible rows is exponentially large. Thus, the larger the dimensionality, the more difficult it becomes to sample the space. This causes many problems. Algorithms that operate on high-dimensional data tend to have a very high time complexity. Many machine learning algorithms, for example, struggle with high-dimensional data. This has become known as the curse of dimensionality. Reducing data into fewer dimensions often makes analysis algorithms more efficient, and can help machine learning algorithms make more accurate predictions. Humans often have difficulty comprehending data in many dimensions. Thus, reducing data to a small number of dimensions is useful for visualization purposes. Plot of the two-dimensional points that results from using a NLDR algorithm. In this case, Manifold Sculpting used to reduce the data into just two dimensions (rotation and scale). The reduced-dimensional representations of data are often referred to as \\"intrinsic variables\\". This description implies that these are the values from which the data was produced. For example, consider a dataset that contains images of a letter 'A', which has been scaled and rotated by varying amounts. Each image has 32x32 pixels. Each image can be represented as a vector of 1024 pixel values. Each row is a sample on a two-dimensional manifold in 1024-dimensional space (a Hamming space). The intrinsic dimensionality is two, because two variables (rotation and scale) were varied in order to produce the data. Information about the shape or look of a letter 'A' is not part of the intrinsic variables because it is the same in every instance. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction will discard the correlated information (the letter 'A') and recover only the varying information (rotation and scale). The image to the right shows sample images from this dataset (to save space, not all input images are shown), and a plot of the two-dimensional points that results from using a NLDR algorithm (in this case, Manifold Sculpting was used) to reduce the data into just two dimensions. PCA (a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm) is used to reduce this same dataset into two dimensions, the resulting values are not so well organized. By comparison, if Principal component analysis, which is a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, is used to reduce this same dataset into two dimensions, the resulting values are not so well organized. This demonstrates that the high-dimensional vectors (each representing a letter 'A') that sample this manifold vary in a non-linear manner. It should be apparent, therefore, that NLDR has several applications in the field of computer-vision. For example, consider a robot that uses a camera to navigate in a closed static environment. The images obtained by that camera can be considered to be samples on a manifold in high-dimensional space, and the intrinsic variables of that manifold will represent the robot's position and orientation. This utility is not limited to robots. Dynamical systems, a more general class of systems, which includes robots, are defined in terms of a manifold. Active research in NLDR seeks to unfold the observation manifolds associated with dynamical systems to develop techniques for modeling such systems and enable them to operate autonomously.Gashler, M. and Martinez, T., Temporal Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction, In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN'11, pp. 1959‚Äì1966, 2011 Some of the more prominent manifold learning algorithms are listed below. An algorithm may learn an internal model of the data, which can be used to map points unavailable at training time into the embedding in a process often called out-of-sample extension. Important Concepts  Sammon's mapping  Sammon's mapping is one of the first and most popular NLDR techniques. SOM (a broken line with red squares, 20 nodes). The first principal component is presented by a blue straight line. Data points are the small grey circles. For PCA, the Fraction of variance unexplained in this example is 23.23%, for SOM it is 6.86%.The illustration is prepared using free software: E.M. Mirkes, Principal Component Analysis and Self-Organizing Maps: applet. University of Leicester, 2011  Self-organizing map  The self-organizing map (SOM, also called Kohonen map) and its probabilistic variant generative topographic mapping (GTM) use a point representation in the embedded space to form a latent variable model based on a non-linear mapping from the embedded space to the high-dimensional space.Yin, Hujun; Learning Nonlinear Principal Manifolds by Self-Organising Maps, in A.N. Gorban, B. K√©gl, D.C. Wunsch, and A. Zinovyev (Eds.), Principal Manifolds for Data Visualization and Dimension Reduction, Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Engineering (LNCSE), vol. 58, Berlin, Germany: Springer, 2007, Ch. 3, pp. 68-95. These techniques are related to work on density networks, which also are based around the same probabilistic model.  Kernel principal component analysis  Perhaps the most widely used algorithm for manifold learning is kernel PCA.B. Sch√∂lkopf, A. Smola, K.-R. M√ºller, Nonlinear Component Analysis as a Kernel Eigenvalue Problem. Neural Computation 10(5):1299-1319, 1998, MIT Press Cambridge, MA, USA, doi:10.1162/089976698300017467 It is a combination of Principal component analysis and the kernel trick. PCA begins by computing the covariance matrix of the m \\\\times n matrix \\\\mathbf{X} :C = \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum_{i=1}^m{\\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\mathbf{x}_i^\\\\mathsf{T}}. It then projects the data onto the first k eigenvectors of that matrix. By comparison, KPCA begins by computing the covariance matrix of the data after being transformed into a higher-dimensional space, :C = \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum_{i=1}^m{\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_i)\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_i)^\\\\mathsf{T}}. It then projects the transformed data onto the first k eigenvectors of that matrix, just like PCA. It uses the kernel trick to factor away much of the computation, such that the entire process can be performed without actually computing \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{x}). Of course \\\\Phi must be chosen such that it has a known corresponding kernel. Unfortunately, it is not trivial to find a good kernel for a given problem, so KPCA does not yield good results with some problems when using standard kernels. For example, it is known to perform poorly with these kernels on the Swiss roll manifold. However, one can view certain other methods that perform well in such settings (e.g., Laplacian Eigenmaps, LLE) as special cases of kernel PCA by constructing a data- dependent kernel matrix.Jihun Ham, Daniel D. Lee, Sebastian Mika, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf. A kernel view of the dimensionality reduction of manifolds. Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Machine Learning, Banff, Canada, 2004. doi:10.1145/1015330.1015417 KPCA has an internal model, so it can be used to map points onto its embedding that were not available at training time.  Principal curves and manifolds  UN 171 countries in 4-dimensional space formed by the values of 4 indicators: gross product per capita, life expectancy, infant mortality, tuberculosis incidence. Different forms and colors correspond to various geographical locations. Red bold line represents the principal curve, approximating the dataset. This principal curve was produced by the method of elastic map. Software is available for free non-commercial use.A. Zinovyev, ViDaExpert - Multidimensional Data Visualization Tool (free for non-commercial use). Institut Curie, Paris.A. Zinovyev, ViDaExpert overview, IHES (Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques), Bures-Sur-Yvette, √éle-de-France. Principal curves and manifolds give the natural geometric framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and extend the geometric interpretation of PCA by explicitly constructing an embedded manifold, and by encoding using standard geometric projection onto the manifold. This approach was proposed by Trevor Hastie in his thesis (1984) and developed further by many authors. How to define the \\"simplicity\\" of the manifold is problem-dependent, however, it is commonly measured by the intrinsic dimensionality and/or the smoothness of the manifold. Usually, the principal manifold is defined as a solution to an optimization problem. The objective function includes a quality of data approximation and some penalty terms for the bending of the manifold. The popular initial approximations are generated by linear PCA, Kohonen's SOM or autoencoders. The elastic map method provides the expectation-maximization algorithm for principal manifold learning with minimization of quadratic energy functional at the \\"maximization\\" step.  Laplacian eigenmaps  Laplacian Eigenmaps uses spectral techniques to perform dimensionality reduction. This technique relies on the basic assumption that the data lies in a low-dimensional manifold in a high-dimensional space. Matlab code for Laplacian Eigenmaps can be found in algorithms at Ohio-state.edu This algorithm cannot embed out-of-sample points, but techniques based on Reproducing kernel Hilbert space regularization exist for adding this capability. Such techniques can be applied to other nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms as well. Traditional techniques like principal component analysis do not consider the intrinsic geometry of the data. Laplacian eigenmaps builds a graph from neighborhood information of the data set. Each data point serves as a node on the graph and connectivity between nodes is governed by the proximity of neighboring points (using e.g. the k-nearest neighbor algorithm). The graph thus generated can be considered as a discrete approximation of the low-dimensional manifold in the high-dimensional space. Minimization of a cost function based on the graph ensures that points close to each other on the manifold are mapped close to each other in the low- dimensional space, preserving local distances. The eigenfunctions of the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator on the manifold serve as the embedding dimensions, since under mild conditions this operator has a countable spectrum that is a basis for square integrable functions on the manifold (compare to Fourier series on the unit circle manifold). Attempts to place Laplacian eigenmaps on solid theoretical ground have met with some success, as under certain nonrestrictive assumptions, the graph Laplacian matrix has been shown to converge to the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator as the number of points goes to infinity. In classification applications, low dimension manifolds can be used to model data classes which can be defined from sets of observed instances. Each observed instance can be described by two independent factors termed ‚Äôcontent‚Äô and ‚Äôstyle‚Äô, where ‚Äôcontent‚Äô is the invariant factor related to the essence of the class and ‚Äôstyle‚Äô expresses variations in that class between instances. Unfortunately, Laplacian Eigenmaps may fail to produce a coherent representation of a class of interest when training data consist of instances varying significantly in terms of style. In the case of classes which are represented by multivariate sequences, Structural Laplacian Eigenmaps has been proposed to overcome this issue by adding additional constraints within the Laplacian Eigenmaps neighborhood information graph to better reflect the intrinsic structure of the class. More specifically, the graph is used to encode both the sequential structure of the multivariate sequences and, to minimise stylistic variations, proximity between data points of different sequences or even within a sequence, if it contains repetitions. Using dynamic time warping, proximity is detected by finding correspondences between and within sections of the multivariate sequences that exhibit high similarity. Experiments conducted on vision-based activity recognition, object orientation classification and human 3D pose recovery applications have demonstrate the added value of Structural Laplacian Eigenmaps when dealing with multivariate sequence data. An extension of Structural Laplacian Eigenmaps, Generalized Laplacian Eigenmaps led to the generation of manifolds where one of the dimensions specifically represents variations in style. This has proved particularly valuable in applications such as tracking of the human articulated body and silhouette extraction.  Isomap  IsomapJ. B. Tenenbaum, V. de Silva, J. C. Langford, A Global Geometric Framework for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction, Science 290, (2000), 2319-2323. is a combination of the Floyd‚ÄìWarshall algorithm with classic Multidimensional Scaling. Classic Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) takes a matrix of pair-wise distances between all points and computes a position for each point. Isomap assumes that the pair-wise distances are only known between neighboring points, and uses the Floyd‚ÄìWarshall algorithm to compute the pair-wise distances between all other points. This effectively estimates the full matrix of pair-wise geodesic distances between all of the points. Isomap then uses classic MDS to compute the reduced-dimensional positions of all the points. Landmark-Isomap is a variant of this algorithm that uses landmarks to increase speed, at the cost of some accuracy. In manifold learning, the input data is assumed to be sampled from a low dimensional manifold that is embedded inside of a higher-dimensional vector space. The main intuition behind MVU is to exploit the local linearity of manifolds and create a mapping that preserves local neighbourhoods at every point of the underlying manifold.  Locally- linear embedding  Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)S. T. Roweis and L. K. Saul, Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction by Locally Linear Embedding, Science Vol 290, 22 December 2000, 2323-2326. was presented at approximately the same time as Isomap. It has several advantages over Isomap, including faster optimization when implemented to take advantage of sparse matrix algorithms, and better results with many problems. LLE also begins by finding a set of the nearest neighbors of each point. It then computes a set of weights for each point that best describes the point as a linear combination of its neighbors. Finally, it uses an eigenvector-based optimization technique to find the low- dimensional embedding of points, such that each point is still described with the same linear combination of its neighbors. LLE tends to handle non-uniform sample densities poorly because there is no fixed unit to prevent the weights from drifting as various regions differ in sample densities. LLE has no internal model. LLE computes the barycentric coordinates of a point Xi based on its neighbors Xj. The original point is reconstructed by a linear combination, given by the weight matrix Wij, of its neighbors. The reconstruction error is given by the cost function E(W). : E(W) = \\\\sum_i {\\\\mathbf{X}_i - \\\\sum_j {\\\\mathbf{W}_{ij}\\\\mathbf{X}_j}}^\\\\mathsf{2} The weights Wij refer to the amount of contribution the point Xj has while reconstructing the point Xi. The cost function is minimized under two constraints: (a) Each data point Xi is reconstructed only from its neighbors, thus enforcing Wij to be zero if point Xj is not a neighbor of the point Xi and (b) The sum of every row of the weight matrix equals 1. : \\\\sum_j {\\\\mathbf{W}_{ij}} = 1 The original data points are collected in a D dimensional space and the goal of the algorithm is to reduce the dimensionality to d such that D >> d. The same weights Wij that reconstructs the ith data point in the D dimensional space will be used to reconstruct the same point in the lower d dimensional space. A neighborhood preserving map is created based on this idea. Each point Xi in the D dimensional space is mapped onto a point Yi in the d dimensional space by minimizing the cost function : C(Y) = \\\\sum_i {\\\\mathbf{Y}_i - \\\\sum_j {\\\\mathbf{W}_{ij}\\\\mathbf{Y}_j}}^\\\\mathsf{2} In this cost function, unlike the previous one, the weights Wij are kept fixed and the minimization is done on the points Yi to optimize the coordinates. This minimization problem can be solved by solving a sparse N X N eigen value problem (N being the number of data points), whose bottom d nonzero eigen vectors provide an orthogonal set of coordinates. Generally the data points are reconstructed from K nearest neighbors, as measured by Euclidean distance. For such an implementation the algorithm has only one free parameter K, which can be chosen by cross validation.  Hessian Locally-Linear Embedding (Hessian LLE)  Like LLE, Hessian LLE is also based on sparse matrix techniques. It tends to yield results of a much higher quality than LLE. Unfortunately, it has a very costly computational complexity, so it is not well-suited for heavily sampled manifolds. It has no internal model.  Modified Locally-Linear Embedding (MLLE)  Modified LLE (MLLE)Z. Zhang and J. Wang, \\"MLLE: Modified Locally Linear Embedding Using Multiple Weights\\" http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.70.382 is another LLE variant which uses multiple weights in each neighborhood to address the local weight matrix conditioning problem which leads to distortions in LLE maps. Loosely speaking the multiple weights are the local orthogonal projection of the original weights produced by LLE. The creators of this regularised variant are also the authors of Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), which is implicit in the MLLE formulation when realising that the global optimisation of the orthogonal projections of each weight vector, in-essence, aligns the local tangent spaces of every data point. The theoretical and empirical implications from the correct application of this algorithm are far-reaching.  Local tangent space alignment  LTSA is based on the intuition that when a manifold is correctly unfolded, all of the tangent hyperplanes to the manifold will become aligned. It begins by computing the k-nearest neighbors of every point. It computes the tangent space at every point by computing the d-first principal components in each local neighborhood. It then optimizes to find an embedding that aligns the tangent spaces.  Maximum variance unfolding  Maximum Variance Unfolding, Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding share a common intuition relying on the notion that if a manifold is properly unfolded, then variance over the points is maximized. Its initial step, like Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding, is finding the k-nearest neighbors of every point. It then seeks to solve the problem of maximizing the distance between all non-neighboring points, constrained such that the distances between neighboring points are preserved. The primary contribution of this algorithm is a technique for casting this problem as a semidefinite programming problem. Unfortunately, semidefinite programming solvers have a high computational cost. Like Locally Linear Embedding, it has no internal model.  Autoencoders  An autoencoder is a feed-forward neural network which is trained to approximate the identity function. That is, it is trained to map from a vector of values to the same vector. When used for dimensionality reduction purposes, one of the hidden layers in the network is limited to contain only a small number of network units. Thus, the network must learn to encode the vector into a small number of dimensions and then decode it back into the original space. Thus, the first half of the network is a model which maps from high to low-dimensional space, and the second half maps from low to high-dimensional space. Although the idea of autoencoders is quite old, training of deep autoencoders has only recently become possible through the use of restricted Boltzmann machines and stacked denoising autoencoders. Related to autoencoders is the NeuroScale algorithm, which uses stress functions inspired by multidimensional scaling and Sammon mappings (see above) to learn a non-linear mapping from the high-dimensional to the embedded space. The mappings in NeuroScale are based on radial basis function networks. Another usage of a neural network for dimensionality reduction is to make it learn the tangent planes in the data.  Gaussian process latent variable models  Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM)N. Lawrence, Probabilistic Non-linear Principal Component Analysis with Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models, Journal of Machine Learning Research 6(Nov):1783‚Äì1816, 2005. are probabilistic dimensionality reduction methods that use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to find a lower dimensional non-linear embedding of high dimensional data. They are an extension of the Probabilistic formulation of PCA. The model is defined probabilistically and the latent variables are then marginalized and parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood. Like kernel PCA they use a kernel function to form a non linear mapping (in the form of a Gaussian process). However, in the GPLVM the mapping is from the embedded(latent) space to the data space (like density networks and GTM) whereas in kernel PCA it is in the opposite direction. It was originally proposed for visualization of high dimensional data but has been extended to construct a shared manifold model between two observation spaces. GPLVM and its many variants have been proposed specially for human motion modeling, e.g., back constrained GPLVM, GP dynamic model (GPDM), balanced GPDM (B-GPDM) and topologically constrained GPDM. To capture the coupling effect of the pose and gait manifolds in the gait analysis, a multi-layer joint gait-pose manifolds was proposed.M. Ding, G. Fan, Multilayer Joint Gait-Pose Manifolds for Human Gait Motion Modeling, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, Volume: 45, Issue: 11, Nov 2015.  t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding  t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is widely used. It is one of a family of stochastic neighbor embedding methods. The algorithm computes the probability that pairs of datapoints in the high-dimensional space are related, and then chooses low-dimensional embeddings which produce a similar distribution.  Other Algorithms   Relational perspective map  Relational perspective map is a multidimensional scaling algorithm. The algorithm finds a configuration of data points on a manifold by simulating a multi-particle dynamic system on a closed manifold, where data points are mapped to particles and distances (or dissimilarity) between data points represent a repulsive force. As the manifold gradually grows in size the multi-particle system cools down gradually and converges to a configuration that reflects the distance information of the data points. Relational perspective map was inspired by a physical model in which positively charged particles move freely on the surface of a ball. Guided by the Coulomb force between particles, the minimal energy configuration of the particles will reflect the strength of repulsive forces between the particles. The Relational perspective map was introduced in.James X. Li, Visualizing high-dimensional data with relational perspective map, Information Visualization (2004) 3, 49‚Äì59 The algorithm firstly used the flat torus as the image manifold, then it has been extended (in the software VisuMap to use other types of closed manifolds, like the sphere, projective space, and Klein bottle, as image manifolds.  Contagion maps  Contagion maps use multiple contagions on a network to map the nodes as a point cloud. In the case of the Global cascades model the speed of the spread can be adjusted with the threshold parameter t \\\\in [0,1] . For t=0 the contagion map is equivalent to the Isomap algorithm.  Curvilinear component analysis  Curvilinear component analysis (CCA) looks for the configuration of points in the output space that preserves original distances as much as possible while focusing on small distances in the output space (conversely to Sammon's mapping which focus on small distances in original space). It should be noticed that CCA, as an iterative learning algorithm, actually starts with focus on large distances (like the Sammon algorithm), then gradually change focus to small distances. The small distance information will overwrite the large distance information, if compromises between the two have to be made. The stress function of CCA is related to a sum of right Bregman divergences.  Curvilinear distance analysis  CDA trains a self-organizing neural network to fit the manifold and seeks to preserve geodesic distances in its embedding. It is based on Curvilinear Component Analysis (which extended Sammon's mapping), but uses geodesic distances instead.  Diffeomorphic dimensionality reduction  Diffeomorphic Dimensionality Reduction or DiffeomapChristian Walder and Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf, Diffeomorphic Dimensionality Reduction, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 22, 2009, pp. 1713‚Äì1720, MIT Press learns a smooth diffeomorphic mapping which transports the data onto a lower- dimensional linear subspace. The methods solves for a smooth time indexed vector field such that flows along the field which start at the data points will end at a lower-dimensional linear subspace, thereby attempting to preserve pairwise differences under both the forward and inverse mapping.  Manifold alignment  Manifold alignment takes advantage of the assumption that disparate data sets produced by similar generating processes will share a similar underlying manifold representation. By learning projections from each original space to the shared manifold, correspondences are recovered and knowledge from one domain can be transferred to another. Most manifold alignment techniques consider only two data sets, but the concept extends to arbitrarily many initial data sets.  Diffusion maps  Diffusion maps leverages the relationship between heat diffusion and a random walk (Markov Chain); an analogy is drawn between the diffusion operator on a manifold and a Markov transition matrix operating on functions defined on the graph whose nodes were sampled from the manifold. In particular, let a data set be represented by \\\\mathbf{X} = [x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n] \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbf {R^D}. The underlying assumption of diffusion map is that the high-dimensional data lies on a low-dimensional manifold of dimension \\\\mathbf{d} . Let X represent the data set and \\\\mu represent the distribution of the data points on X. Further, define a kernel which represents some notion of affinity of the points in X. The kernel \\\\mathit{k} has the following properties : k(x,y) = k(y,x), \\\\, k is symmetric : k(x,y) \\\\geq 0\\\\qquad \\\\forall x,y, k k is positivity preserving Thus one can think of the individual data points as the nodes of a graph and the kernel k as defining some sort of affinity on that graph. The graph is symmetric by construction since the kernel is symmetric. It is easy to see here that from the tuple (X,k) one can construct a reversible Markov Chain. This technique is common to a variety of fields and is known as the graph Laplacian. For example, the graph K = (X,E) can be constructed using a Gaussian kernel. : K_{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} e^{-\\\\x_i -x_j\\\\^2_2/\\\\sigma ^2} & \\\\text{if } x_i \\\\sim x_j \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} In the above equation, x_i \\\\sim x_j denotes that x_i is a nearest neighbor of x_j . Properly, Geodesic distance should be used to actually measure distances on the manifold. Since the exact structure of the manifold is not available, for the nearest neighbors the geodesic distance is approximated by euclidean distance. The choice \\\\sigma modulates our notion of proximity in the sense that if \\\\x_i - x_j\\\\_2 \\\\gg \\\\sigma then K_{ij} = 0 and if \\\\x_i - x_j\\\\_2 \\\\ll \\\\sigma then K_{ij} = 1 . The former means that very little diffusion has taken place while the latter implies that the diffusion process is nearly complete. Different strategies to choose \\\\sigma can be found in. In order to faithfully represent a Markov matrix, K must be normalized by the corresponding degree matrix D : : P = D^{-1}K. \\\\, P now represents a Markov chain. P(x_i,x_j) is the probability of transitioning from x_i to x_j in one time step. Similarly the probability of transitioning from x_i to x_j in t time steps is given by P^t (x_i,x_j) . Here P^t is the matrix P multiplied by itself t times. The Markov matrix P constitutes some notion of local geometry of the data set X. The major difference between diffusion maps and principal component analysis is that only local features of the data are considered in diffusion maps as opposed to taking correlations of the entire data set. K defines a random walk on the data set which means that the kernel captures some local geometry of data set. The Markov chain defines fast and slow directions of propagation through the kernel values. As the walk propagates forward in time, the local geometry information aggregates in the same way as local transitions (defined by differential equations) of the dynamical system. The metaphor of diffusion arises from the definition of a family diffusion distance { D_t }_{t \\\\in N} : D_t^2(x,y) = p_t(x,\\\\cdot) - p_t(y,\\\\cdot)^2 For fixed t, D_t defines a distance between any two points of the data set based on path connectivity: the value of D_t(x,y) will be smaller the more paths that connect x to y and vice versa. Because the quantity D_t(x,y) involves a sum over of all paths of length t, D_t is much more robust to noise in the data than geodesic distance. D_t takes into account all the relation between points x and y while calculating the distance and serves as a better notion of proximity than just Euclidean distance or even geodesic distance.  Local multidimensional scaling  Local Multidimensional Scaling performs multidimensional scaling in local regions, and then uses convex optimization to fit all the pieces together.  Nonlinear PCA  Nonlinear PCA (NLPCA) uses backpropagation to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to fit to a manifold. Unlike typical MLP training, which only updates the weights, NLPCA updates both the weights and the inputs. That is, both the weights and inputs are treated as latent values. After training, the latent inputs are a low-dimensional representation of the observed vectors, and the MLP maps from that low-dimensional representation to the high-dimensional observation space.  Data-driven high-dimensional scaling  Data-Driven High Dimensional Scaling (DD-HDS)S. Lespinats, M. Verleysen, A. Giron, B. Fertil, DD-HDS: a tool for visualization and exploration of high-dimensional data, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 18 (5) (2007) 1265‚Äì1279. is closely related to Sammon's mapping and curvilinear component analysis except that (1) it simultaneously penalizes false neighborhoods and tears by focusing on small distances in both original and output space, and that (2) it accounts for concentration of measure phenomenon by adapting the weighting function to the distance distribution.  Manifold sculpting  Manifold SculptingGashler, M. and Ventura, D. and Martinez, T., Iterative Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction with Manifold Sculpting, In Platt, J.C. and Koller, D. and Singer, Y. and Roweis, S., editor, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 20, pp. 513‚Äì520, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2008 uses graduated optimization to find an embedding. Like other algorithms, it computes the k-nearest neighbors and tries to seek an embedding that preserves relationships in local neighborhoods. It slowly scales variance out of higher dimensions, while simultaneously adjusting points in lower dimensions to preserve those relationships. If the rate of scaling is small, it can find very precise embeddings. It boasts higher empirical accuracy than other algorithms with several problems. It can also be used to refine the results from other manifold learning algorithms. It struggles to unfold some manifolds, however, unless a very slow scaling rate is used. It has no model.  RankVisu  RankVisuLespinats S., Fertil B., Villemain P. and Herault J., Rankvisu: Mapping from the neighbourhood network, Neurocomputing, vol. 72 (13‚Äì15), pp. 2964‚Äì2978, 2009. is designed to preserve rank of neighborhood rather than distance. RankVisu is especially useful on difficult tasks (when the preservation of distance cannot be achieved satisfyingly). Indeed, the rank of neighborhood is less informative than distance (ranks can be deduced from distances but distances cannot be deduced from ranks) and its preservation is thus easier.

M. and Kimmel R., Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction by Topologically Constrained Isometric Embedding, International Journal of Computer Vision, Volume 89, Number 1, 56‚Äì68, 2010 is an algorithm based on approximating geodesic distances after filtering geodesics inconsistent with the Euclidean metric. Aimed at correcting the distortions caused when Isomap is used to map intrinsically non-convex data, TCIE uses weight least-squares MDS in order to obtain a more accurate mapping. The TCIE algorithm first detects possible boundary points in the data, and during computation of the geodesic length marks inconsistent geodesics, to be given a small weight in the weighted Stress majorization that follows.  Uniform manifold approximation and projection  Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique. Visually, it is similar to t-SNE, but it assumes that the data is uniformly distributed on a locally connected Riemannian manifold and that the Riemannian metric is locally constant or approximately locally constant. Methods based on proximity matrices A method based on proximity matrices is one where the data is presented to the algorithm in the form of a similarity matrix or a distance matrix. These methods all fall under the broader class of metric multidimensional scaling. The variations tend to be differences in how the proximity data is computed; for example, Isomap, locally linear embeddings, maximum variance unfolding, and Sammon mapping (which is not in fact a mapping) are examples of metric multidimensional scaling methods.

The Federico Santa Mar√≠a Technical University is the alma mater of several prominent businessmen, engineers and Chilean scientists. Its students and alumni are known as \\"Sansanos\\". The UTFSM was the first Chilean university to confer a doctorate in engineering in 1962 and the first higher-education institution in Latin America to confer this degree.http://www.bib.utfsm.cl/nuevositio/attachments/087_80%20a%C3%B1os%20de%20universidad.pdf Rese√±a Hist√≥rica ‚Äì Biblioteca UTFSM The UTFSM university radio is the oldest campus radio in Latin America. The university admission is very competitive and, it is known for its rigorous study requirements, demanding study program, and for being the only engineering university in Chile to require physical training as a compulsory part of the curriculum in its Valparaiso and Santiago Campuses. For the years 2011‚Äì2016, the UTFSM has an undergraduate retention rate of 81.0% by the first year of studies, and a 66.4% by the second year.http://www.mifuturo.cl/index.php/donde-y-que-estudiar/buscador-de- instituciones?cmbtipos=3&cmbnombres;=88 Less than 1% of its students are international, and most of the available courses are imparted in Spanish. The UTFSM has been historically perceived as one of the most prestigious engineering schools in the country and more recently, with the appearance of national and international rankings, has been placed among the top Universities in Chile and Latin America.=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university- rankings/2014-15/world-ranking/region/south- america=\\"http://www.quepasa.cl/articulo/ojos-de-la- llave/2014/12/17-15854-9-ranking-de-universidades-2014.shtml It is ranked 1st in Chile and 2nd in Latin America by The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2001‚Äì2002. The graduation date is held on the 20th of December every year, since it commemorates the anniversary of the death of the founder, Federico Santa Maria Carrera, on the 20th of December 1925.  History  Main UTFSM Campus in Valparaiso, 2016 The university takes its name from Federico Santa Mar√≠a, a Chilean philanthropist that lived in France. He raised a huge fortune as a broker in the sugar market in Paris. Before his death, he donated all his fortune to create a university in Valpara√≠so, his hometown. Although the exact amount of his fortune is unknown, it is believed to have been around 2 billion dollars of today's currency. While in Paris in 1920, in his testament, Santa Mar√≠a donated his fortune with the idea of building a high-standard technical and scientific institution. In his will, Santa Mar√≠a manifested that his desired executors contribute to material progress and expand Chile's cultural horizons; altruistic ideas which sought to facilitate entry into the academic life of outstanding compatriots dispossessed but without further requirement than merit, skills and high academic achievement. This institution would accept and prepare the best students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to gain technical and scientific knowledge that contribute to the progress of the country. The executors were chosen by Santa Mar√≠a to be Agustin Edwards Mac-Clure, Juan Brown Caces, Carlos van Buren and Andrew Geddes. Following his philosophy, on March 31, 1926, an institution was created to develop Santa Mar√≠a's legacy. In 1931, the School of Crafts and Arts and School of Engineering Jos√© Miguel Carrera was founded. In 1935, its name changed to Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a. The condition imposed by Federico Santa Mar√≠a was that, during the first 10 years, the university must receive academics from the best schools of sciences and engineering. Following this imperative, the executor of this project, Agust√≠n Edwards Mac-Clure, traveled to Germany where he contacted Karl Laudien, at the time rector of a technical school in the Western Pemerania region, and he became the first rector of the university. From that moment, the university received a strong German influence in its engineering education. Several German engineers and scientists arrived before and after the second world war from institutions such as TU Berlin, Berlin University, and Leipzig University among other German institutions. They brought to the University cutting edge knowledge in physics, chemistry and engineering. For example, Arnold Keller, professor of the Physics department at UTFSM, was involved in the development of the V-1 rockets during the second world war, as part of the team of Wernher von Braun.http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1985/02/17/038.html Research in new areas to the country such as Solar Energy, or Chemistry of Natural Products were created, which delivered two Nacional Science Prize awards, Herbert Appel in 1970, and Juan Garbarino in 1998. right In 1934, the Scientia magazine is published, becoming the voice for the university's academic work. In 1937, the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria Radio was created, becoming the first university radio broadcaster in Chile and Latin America,http://www.radio.utfsm.cl/ focused to broadcasting information and cultural programs. The radio still broadcasts to this day, in the AM: 1.450 and FM: 99,7 signals in the Valparaiso region. The radio also has an online signal.for more information visit the webpage of the radio http://www.utfsm.cl/vida-universitaria/radio/ In 1939, the Alumni association was founded, known today as AEXA (Asociaci√≥n de Ex-Alumnos). In 1960, the Graduate School was created, and its first director was Herbert Appel (1960-1964), offering the PhD study lines for chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. In 1963 the university became the first higher- education institution in Latin America to confer a doctorate in engineering, in cooperation with the University of Pittsburgh. In the 1960s the University started a strategy of national and international expansion. In 1966 the Technical campus \\"Vi√±a del Mar\\" was founded. In 1972 the campus \\"Rey Balduino de B√©lgica\\" in the southeast city of Concepci√≥n with orientation in technical- professional areas was founded. The project received strong financial support from Baudouin King. In 1964, the university grants for the first time a technical degree to a woman, the chemical technician Patricia Guzman. In 1965 Graciela Mu√±oz graduates as its first female engineer. The UTFSM was the first university of the 8 existing universities in Chile at the time to restart its operations on 15 October 1973, after the Military coup of 11 September 1973. Campuses The university has four campuses and two branch campuses (sedes). These are in four Chilean cities and Guayaquil, Ecuador: #Casa Central, main campus. Inaugurated in 1931 in Valpara√≠so #Campus Santiago Vitacura and Campus Santiago San Joaqu√≠n, in the capital, Santiago. #Campus Guayaquil, located in Guayaquil, Ecuador. #Sede Jos√© Miguel Carrera, located in Vi√±a del Mar. #Sede Rey Balduino de B√©lgica, in the seaport city of Talcahuano. While the campuses are focused on undergraduate, graduate and university academical activities, sedes are mainly dedicated to technical degrees. Main campus, Valpara√≠so The main UTFSM campus (or Casa Central) is located in Valpara√≠so, covering most of the front area of Los Placeres hill, on the grounds of the former Pudeto fort. The site faces the Pacific coast and it is visible from many parts of the bay of Valpara√≠so. Main Campus in Valpara√≠so, 1949 The building was designed by Josu√© Smith Solar, one of the most respected Chilean architects of the 20th century, and his son Jos√© Smith Miller. The American Neo-Gothic style campus is considered one of the foremost works of Chilean architecture. The campus is also recognised for its beautiful gardening, with native and exotic species. In 2001, the illumination of the university frontis was renewed through a contest organised by the Chilean branch of Philips. The main campus has a gothic scholastic architecture with a privileged view to the Pacific Ocean. This campus includes more than 3 hectares of green areas making it the biggest urban park in Valparaiso, despite it being closed to the public. In 2008 it was chosen as one of the most remarkable national architectural works of the 20th century.http://www.dgc.usm.cl/2008/12/29/casa- central-elegida-una-de-las-grandes-construcciones-del-siglo-xx/ Casa Central elegida una de las grandes construcciones del Siglo XX  Branch campus Vi√±a del Mar, \\"Jos√© Miguel Carrera\\"  In the 1960s, the University formulated an expansion plan. With financial assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the support of the Ford Foundation, advice from Dunwoody Industrial Institute in the US, and a donation of land by Chile's Agricultural Development Institute INDAP (from the Spanish \\"Instituto de Desarrollo Agropecuario\\"), a fully furnished building was constructed in 1971 in Vi√±a del Mar, and it was named the \\"Jose Miguel Carrera\\" branch campus, following the testamentary vision of the University founder, the philanthropist Federico Santa Mar√≠a. This branch is located on the border between the communes of Vina del Mar and Quilpu√© in Chile.  Branch campus Concepci√≥n, \\"Rey Baduino de Belgica\\"  By the mid-1960s, the University planned to install six schools in different parts of the country. In October 1965, the Kings of Belgium, Baudouin I and Fabiola de Mora y Aragon visited the University headquarters in Valpara√≠so, were introduced to its educational project and as a result initiated conversations for the construction of a branch campus in the city of Concepci√≥n. Meanwhile, our country strengthens their contributions: the government facilitates the exchange of funds provided by Belgium; local businesses such as the San Pedro Sawmills, Cementos Bio Bio, Pacific Steel Company, Fanaloza, Inchalam, Pizarre√±o, Glasses Lirqu√©n, among others, also contributed in its construction. Additionally, a donation of Archbishop of Concepci√≥n provided the land needed for the building construction. Its construction began in 1969. Academic activities started on April 26, 1971, offering the careers of Electronics, Electrical, Structural Mechanics, Maintenance Mechanics, and Chemistry. On February 14, 1972, the campus branch was inaugurated solemnly in the presence of the President of Chile, Salvador Allende Gossens, and the University rector, Jaime Chiang Acosta.  Academic rankings and accreditation  For 10 consecutive years, UTFSM has been ranked among the three best Universities in Chile in terms of quality perception given by more than 1000 important national business executives.http://www.dgc.usm.cl/2010/12/03/usm-tercer-lugar-en-encuesta-de- percepcion-de-calidad-2010/http://www.quepasa.cl/articulo/ojos-de-la- llave/2014/12/17-15854-9-ranking-de-universidades-2014.shtml In 2012, the University was ranked 5 between 9,500 schools of engineering in the world according to their impact factor in the last 5 years (Microsoft Academics),http://academic.research.microsoft.com/RankList?entitytype=7&topdomainid;=8&subdomainid;=0&last;=5 as the latinoamerican university with the largest normalized impact factor, and as the first school of engineering in South America.http://www.scimagoir.com/ Ibero-American Ranking According to Times Higher Education Ranking 2014, UTFSM is among the first 300 best Universities in the World, 2nd in South America and 1st in Chile.http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2014/10/13/684815/ranking-times- higher-education-usm-es-la-unica-universidad-chilena-entre-las-mejores-del- mundo.htmlhttp://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university- rankings/2014-15/world-ranking/region/south-america The UTFSM has consistently been considered as one of the best engineering universities in Latin America, and appears regularly as a highly ranked university in many of the published world university rankings.

Some notable events: * Two rectors died at the time of having the role, i.e., Armando Quezada in 1936, and Commander Juan Naylor in 1977. They were replaced by Interim Rectors until a new rector was chosen through a vote. * One rector have had to resign due to protests within the University,i.e., Carlos Cerutti in 1968. * Three \\"delegate\\" rectors were designated by a military junta. During the Military regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990) the university rector was designated by the military junta instead of a normal voting process. Three \\"delegate rectors\\", retired military men, had this role during the period: Commander Juan Naylor (1973-1977), Vice-admiral Ismael Huerta (1977-1985) and Commander Arturo Ni√±o de Zepeda (1985-1989). * Two of the rectors were siblings, i.e., Jaime Chiang Acosta (1968-1972), and Gustavo Chiang Acosta (1989-1993). * Jaime Chiang Acosta (1969-1972) was the first rector chosen through a voting process in the university community. * Jaime Chiang Acosta (1969-1972) was the first rector that was also a UTFSM alumnus, a Civil Chemical Engineering graduate (1952) with a PhD from the University of Louisiana. *Darcy Fuenzalida, UTFSM Rector 2014-2022Gustavo Chiang Acosta (1989-1993), a UTFSM civil mechanical engineer graduated in 1949, was also the first rector chosen by popular vote of the university community after the end of the Pinochet military regime. {  ! !Rector Name !Period -  Darcy Fuenzalida O'Shee 2014-2022 -  Jose Rodriguez Perez 2006-2014 -  Jose Rodriguez Perez 2005-2006 -  Giovanni Pesce Santana 2001-2005 -  Adolfo Arata Andreani 1993-2001 -  Gustavo Chiang Acosta 1989-1993 -  Arturo Ni√±o de Zepeda Schele (delegate)Commander Ni√±o was named Interim delegate rector in 1984 after health problems in the current delegate rector, Vice admiral Huerta.

Originally, faculties had been considered in the University organization, with the founding of the first three faculties in 1944, Chemical, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Faculties were subsequently abolished under Adolfo Arata's period as rector. {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:90%; line-height:1.4em; width:280px;\\" - align=\\"center\\"  Academic Department  Year founded - align=\\"center\\"  Mechanical Engineering  1944 - align=\\"center\\"  Chemical Engineering  1944 - align=\\"center\\"  Electrical Engineering  1944 - align=\\"center\\"  Construction Engineering  1959 - align=\\"center\\"  Chemical and Environmental Engineering 19XX - align=\\"center\\"  Metallurgical Engineering 1965 - align=\\"center\\"  Computer Engineering / Informatics  1975 - align=\\"center\\"  Electronic Engineering  1982 - align=\\"center\\"  Industrial Engineering  1988 - align=\\"center\\"  Commercial Engineering 1996 - align=\\"center\\"  Architecture 1996 } Within the Chilean campus level, there are 17 different academic departments, though not all of them are in every campus location, and not all degree levels are offered at every location, as the following table shows: {  ! _Academic Department_ !Valparaiso Campus Main Campus !Concepci√≥n Campus \\"Rey Baduino de Belgica\\" !Vi√±a del Mar Campus \\"Jos√© Miguel Carrera\\" !Santiago Campus - Architecture Yes  -  -  - - Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Yes  -  -  - - Electrical Engineering Yes Yes  - Yes - Electronic Engineering Yes Yes  -  - - Physics Yes  -  - Yes - Industrial Engineering Yes  -  - Yes - Commercial Engineering Yes  -  - Yes - Computer Science Engineering Yes  - Yes Yes - Mathematics Yes  -  - Yes - Mechanical Engineering Yes Yes Yes Yes - Civil Engineering and Construction Yes Yes Yes Yes - Chemical and Environmental Engineering Yes  - Yes Yes - Chemistry Yes Yes  - Yes - Physical Education, sports and recreation Yes  -  - Yes - Humanist Studies Yes  -  - Yes - Product Design engineering Yes  - Yes  - - Aeronautic Science  -  -  - Yes } UTFSM is the only Chilean engineering school where sports is an obligatory course in the curriculum during the first three semesters of all its study lines at its Valparaiso and Santiago Campuses. The university offers careers of Commercial Pilot and Aeronautical Engineering in its Academia de Ciencias Aeron√°uticas in a joint venture with Chilean airline Lan Chile. Education alt= The university offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. The undergraduate degrees can be of 12 academic semesters (civil engineering), 10 semesters (engineering, pure sciences and architecture), 8 semesters (Applied Engineering) and 6 semesters (technical careers). The graduate degrees offered by this university are Masters (MSc.) and Doctorate (PhD). The Masters of Science degree requires 2 years of study, and the Doctorate degree requires 3 to 5 years of study. All graduate degrees require entrants to have a bachelor's degree. Engineering degrees The engineering degrees at UTFSM (and throughout Chile) are offered in different degrees of difficulty. *To differentiate it from the engineering studies of 10 semesters, the engineering degree has the suffix of Civil. For example, the degree for 12 academic semesters in chemical engineering has the title of Ingeniero Civil Qu√≠mico, while the degree of 10 semesters has the title of Ingeniero Qu√≠mico.The following Bachelor Engineering degrees are granted by this University: ** Engineering ** Civil ** Environmental ** Electrical ** Electronics ** Computer Science ** Industrial ** Mathematics ** Mechanical ** Metallurgical ** Chemical ** Telematics ** Mining ** Business management ** Product design engineering ** Aircraft business engineering ** Manufacturing and industrial drawing engineering ** Occupational Health and Safety Engineering ** Mechanical processes and maintenance engineering (4 years) *The following Masters of Science are granted by this University: ** Civil Engineering ** Electrical Engineering ** Electronics ** Computer Engineering ** Mechanical ** Chemical Engineering ** Industrial Engineering ** Telematics Engineering ** Metallurgical Engineering ** Physics ** Chemistry ** Mathematics *The following PhD Degrees are granted by this University: ** Biotechnology (Joint degree with the Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so) ** Physics (Joint degree with the Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so) ** Chemistry (2) ** Electronics Engineering ** Chemical Engineering ** Computer Science Engineering ** Mathematics (Joint degree with the Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so and the University of Valpara√≠so) ** Mechanical Engineering Chemical Engineering The Chemical Engineering School at UTFSM was founded together with the foundation of the School of Engineers in 1935, being one of the oldest degrees offered by the university. The first Chilean and Latin American doctorate degree in chemical engineering was given to Walter Gaete Castro in 1962, with a cooperation between UTFSM and University of Pittsburgh, USA. Nowadays, the chemical engineering department has the name of Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering (IQA, in Spanish), where Chemical Engineering and Environmental Engineering degrees are offered. The research topics at IQA are: * Design of industrial processes * Environmental Engineering * Food Science and Bioprocesses * Minerals Processing * Automation and process control The Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering has 12 associate professors, 11 with PhD degrees (92%). The department offers the graduate programs of Master of Science and PhD in Chemical Engineering.  Mechanical Engineering  The Mechanical Engineering School at UTFSM was founded together with the foundation of the School of Engineers in 1935, being one of the oldest degrees offered by the university. Its first four mechanical engineers graduated in 1939. The mechanical engineering department was also among the first to offer a PhD program in 1964 (along with Chemical and Electrical Engineering Departments). The mechanical engineering department has the following research areas: * Thermodynamics * Energy and Renewable energies * Process engineering The department has 20 full-time professors (2016 data), 17 with PhD degrees (85%). Additional to the Bachelor of Sciences in mechanical engineering (BSc.), the department offers the graduate programs of Master of Science (BSc.) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in mechanical engineering. The department has also made substantive efforts to connect with its alumni. A comprehensive list of the graduates of the department can be found online.  Graduate School  The UTFSM graduate school started its activities on the 1st of August, 1960, as a response to the increasing requirements for deeper and applied research in the country. The project was directed by Leroy Stutzman of the University of Pittsburgh, and doctors G.R. Fitterer and John F. Calver, who audited study programs and teaching methods for the project. The first director of the UTFSM graduate school was Herbert Appel, during the period 1960‚Äì1964. The school initially offered PhD study lines in chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. The first UTFSM PhD graduate was Walter Gaete Castro, with a PhD degree in chemical engineering, becoming the first PhD graduate in Latin America.  Doctor Honoris Causa  The \\"Doctor Honoris Causa\\" honorary degree is the highest distinction that UTFSM can bestow. Only seven people have been awarded this honor by UTFSM: * Georges Mikenberg in 2019, physicist, for his work in particle physics and support of the UTFSM participation in CERN research programs. *Raul Zurita in 2015, and first UTFSM alumnus to obtain it, for his successful career in literature * Wolfgang Riesenk√∂nig in 2014, for his achievements advancements in computer science in Chile * Michelle Bachelet in 2007, president of Chile at the time *Frederik Hayek in 1977, Austrian economistFrederick Hayek was invited to the Vi√±a del Mar School of Business, at present the Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez, which at the time was associated and under the tutelage of the UTFSM * Francisco Cereceda in 1964, for his contribution to society and to the university as its former Rector *(Missing Honoris causa recipient) Research Since 2010 UTFSM has been awarded with nearly US$8 million for 76 research projects.http://noticias.universia.cl/ciencia-nn- tt/noticia/2010/12/28/774859/universidad-santa-maria-adjudica-17-proyectos- fondecyt.html Universidad Santa Mar√≠a se adjudica 17 Proyectos Fondecythttp://www.dgc.usm.cl/2012/02/12/universidad-santa-maria-se- adjudica-23-proyectos-fondecyt/ Universidad Santa Mar√≠a se adjudica 23 Proyectos Fondecythttp://latercera.com/contenido/676_219429_9.shtml Many of these projects involve national and international collaborations with prestigious institutions in Latin America (ANDES Laboratory Project, RIABIN Biotechnology Network), Europe (CERN, Max Planck Institut, Politecnico di Milano), and USA (MIT, SLAC), among others.http://www-de.mpimp- golm.mpg.de/pdf/pm/PM-2010-05-17.pdfhttp://profesores.elo.utfsm.cl/~mzanartu/Documents/Mehta_2012_IEEE_TBME_VHM_accepted.pdfhttp://international- relations.web.cern.ch/International-Relations/nms/chile.htmlhttp://accordi- internazionali.cineca.it/accordi.php?continenti=AM&paesi;=%&univ;_stran=%&univ;_ita=16&anni;=%&durata;=&tipologia;=%&natura;=%&denominazione;=&btnSubmit;=Cerca&pag;=2http://andeslab.org/talk/andes- aspera.pdf  Cultural activities   University radio  The Federico Santa Maria University radio was created on the 7th of April, 1937, and it is the oldest university radio in Latin America. It can be heard on 1450 kHz in the AM spectrum, on 99.7 MHz in the FM spectrum, and online.  University Chamber Choir  The Chamber Choir of the Federico Santa Mar√≠a Technical University was founded on August 4, 1951 in its Valparaiso Campus. It is the second oldest choir in Chile with continuous activity. During the choir's over 60 years of existence, it has interpreted an extensive repertoire, including all manifestations of choral western music, from the Middle Ages to the present day. The choir's first performance was at the closing ceremony of the academic year in December 1951, in the Aula Magna, main hall of events in the \\"A\\" building of the University's Main Valpara√≠so campus. Demosthenes Penna, engineering student of this campus, was its founder and first director until 1954. From March 1955, the choir was directed by Silvio Olate Valenzuela for over 28 years until March 1983. From 1983 to 1987, it was directed by Mauricio Pergelier Hernandez. For the next 23 years, from 1987 to 2010, the choir was conducted by Eduardo Silva Cerda.

Norfolk, England. Designed by Charles Barry Jr. Bylaugh Hall, also known as Bylaugh Park, is a country house situated in the parish of Bylaugh in Norfolk, England. History The estate was acquired by Sir John Lombe Bt (c1731-1817) in 1796. His fortune coming from his family‚Äôs silk throwing mill in Derbyshire. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact nature of the transaction. The unsubstantiated traditional story is that he won it from the former owner, Richard Lloyd, in a card game, after Lloyd's butler drugged his wine, but a more prosaic explanation seems likely. Sir John did not marry and therefore had no legal immediate heirs. The terms of his will were complex. He left his estates to Edward Beevor (1771-1847) a barrister who was his half brother (the product of an affair with a married Norwich doctors wife) who assumed the name of Lombe on his inheritance.Carthew, George Alfred, ‚ÄúThe hundred of Launditch and deanery of Brisley‚Äù v.3. p. 400. Online reference Sir John ordered in his Will that a new mansion was to be built on his Bylaugh estate but Edward was reluctant to do this and the terms of this Will were not fulfilled until about 30 years later when his son, also called Edward Beevor, (1800-1852) inherited the property in 1847. The Beevor family Bylaugh Hall 1852 when it was built Edward Beevor (1800-1852) who built Bylaugh Hall assumed the name of Lombe. He was born in 1800 in Norwich. In 1826 he became a Member of Parliament representing the constituency of Arundel. In 1831 he married Marie Rozer de St. Julien who was French.History of Parliament website. Online reference The couple had no children and spent most of their lives travelling abroad. In 1849 after a long delay it was eventually necessary for the Court of Chancery to intervene and order the use of the trust funds for their appointed purpose, and the architects Charles Barry, Jr. and Robert Richardson Banks were at length commissioned to design a suitable house. William Andrews Nesfield advised on the position of the house, and was responsible for laying out the grounds and gardens. The clock tower and surrounding buildings are vaguely reminiscent of the new Houses of Parliament which were designed by Sir Charles Barry, Sr. Along with the Houses of Parliament, it was amongst the first buildings ever to employ steel girders in the supporting structure. The exterior stonework, including the balustrades and the terrace walling, are of magnesian limestone. At this time the estate was the third largest in Norfolk, containing over 19,000 acres (77 km¬≤). Bylaugh Hall was completed in 1852 but Edward died in the same year in Florence before its completion. It was inherited by his uncle Charles Beevor (1776-1860) who assumed the name of Lombe in accordance with Sir John Lombe's Will. He was the first resident of Bylaugh Hall.The Builder, 14 August 1852 (Vol 10), p. 517. Online reference Charles died in 1860 and was succeeded by Rev. Edward Evans (1791- 1861)Norwich Mercury - Wednesday 03 October 1860, p. 3. who was a legitimate descendant of the Lombe family.Carthew, George Alfred, ‚ÄúThe hundred of Launditch and deanery of Brisley‚Äù v.3. p. 402.

Edward Evans took the extra name Lombe making his surname Evans-Lombe, he however only lived for a year and his younger brother Rev. Henry Evans then inherited in turn. He also added Lombe to his name in 1862. Rev Henry Evans-Lombe (1792-1878) was born in 1792 in Kirby Bedon. His father was Thomas Browne Evans (1767-1827) and his mother was Mary Hase who was the niece of Sir John Lombe. He was educated at Cambridge University and became a clergyman. In 1818 he married Sophia Cubitt who was the daughter of Thomas Cubitt of Honing Hall, Norfolk. The 1871 Census shows Henry and Sophia living at Bylaugh Hall with some of their family. There are also fifteen servants living in the Hall ‚Äì a butler, two footmen, a housekeeper, a ladies maid, three housemaids, a scullery maid, a general domestic servant, a coachman, two grooms and two gardeners. He died in 1878 and his son Rev. Henry Evans-Lombe (1819-1897) inherited the Hall. He was born in 1819 in Norfolk. In 1849 he married his cousin Louisa Brown Evans. The couple had five children. He lived in the Hall with his family for almost twenty years and is listed in both the 1881 and 1891 Census with a very large number of servants. He died in 1897 and his son Major Edward Henry Evans-Lombe inherited the house. He did not live in the house but instead rented it to William Knox D‚ÄôArcy, a wealthy mining magnate, from 1899 until 1917 when D‚ÄôArcy died. Major Edward Henry Evans-Lombe (1861-1952) was born in 1861 in Suffolk. He was educated at Cambridge University and joined the military forces in the Prince of Wales Own Norfolk Artillery Militia.Visitation of England and Wales, Vol 19. 1917, p. 86. Online reference He also managed his father's estate at Great Melton Hall. In 1886 he married Albinia Harriet Leslie-Melville who was the daughter of Alexander Samuel Leslie-Melville of Branston Hall, Lincoln. The couple had two daughters who were frequently mentioned in the social pages. The eldest daughter Albinia Mary Evans-Lombe was married in 1911 and a photo is shown of the couple. In 1917 Major Edward Henry Evans-Lombe sold Bylaugh Hall and the 8,150 acre estate to speculators who promptly broke it up into lots and put it back on the market with estate agents John D Wood. The Hall and 736 acres of parkland were bought by the Marsh family. The Marsh family Mrs Agnes Marsh (centre) and two members of the Russian Royal Family, 1922 Bylaugh Hall, 1946 when it was owned by the Marsh family The Marsh family who were Americans owned Bylaugh Hall until 1947. Henry Wheelwright Marsh (1860-1943) seems to have bought the Hall in 1917. He was one of the founders of the insurance brokerage firm Marsh and McLennan with headquarters in Chicago and New York. In 1904 he married Agnes Elizabeth Power (1876-1947) who came from Boston Massachusetts. The couple had no children but they loved to entertain. They made their home in England, while Henry 'commuted' to the US by steamer and before settling for Bylaugh had leased many notable historical buildings. Some of these included Medmenham Abbey, Knebworth House and Warwick Castle.New York Times, 14 April 1943. While they still held the lease on Warwick Castle it seems that they decided to buy their own property and so purchased Bylaugh Hall. They continued to entertain at Warwick Castle after their purchase and a photo of Mrs Agnes Marsh with two members of Russian royalty at one of their house parties is shown. They were separated in 1926 and Agnes made her home at Bylaugh. Other members of Agnes's family also came to live at Bylaugh Hall for extended visits. In 1922 her mother Alice Anne Rice and her step father David Rice became residents.Warwick and Warwickshire Advertiser - Saturday 09 September 1922, p. 8. At the same time her sister Genevieve Power (1885-1964) who had married Sir Russell Wilkinson (1888-1969) moved into the Hall. A notice appeared in ‚ÄúThe Times‚Äù in 1923 advertising for a nursery governess for Mrs Russell Wilkinson's two young children at Bylaugh Hall.The Times, 24 December 1923, p. 1. Agnes's mother Alice died at the Hall in 1935. During the War the Hall was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force. Agnes Marsh moved into the 'Butler's cottage' for the duration.

By 1950, it was in disrepair and in June of that year a 350 lot demolition sale was held which stripped the house of its lead roof and interior fittings leaving it an abandoned ruin. In 1999 the house (and a lodge) was sold to a local sculptor who dreamt of fully restoring it to its former glory. By July 2009 the house and outbuildings were the subject of ongoing financial and legal problems that resulted in their complete repossession and the apparent loss of deposits by a number of people.Telegraph article Retrieved 2010-08-22 In February 2013 the banks by now in possession put the unfinished house up for sale. thecountryseat.org.uk Present use In March 2014 the house and outbuildings were purchased by Ben Budworth, owner of The Lady Magazine published in London.

Overview There was never an \\"official\\" expansion of WAITS, but a common variant was \\"West-coast Alternative to ITS\\"; another variant was \\"Worst Acronym Invented for a Timesharing System\\". The name was endorsed by the SAIL community in a public vote choosing among alternatives. Two of the other contenders were SAINTS (\\"Stanford AI New Timesharing System\\") and SINNERS (\\"Stanford Incompatible Non-New Extensively Rewritten System\\"), proposed by the systems programmers. Though WAITS was less visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted enormous indirect influence. WAITS alumni at Xerox PARC and elsewhere also played major roles in the developments that led to the Xerox Star, the Apple Macintosh, and the SUN workstation (later sold by Sun Microsystems). The early screen modes of Emacs, for example, were directly inspired by WAITS' \\"E\\" editor -- one of a family of editors that were the first to do real-time editing, in which the editing commands were invisible and where one typed text at the point of insertion/overwriting. The modern style of multi-region windowing is said to have originated there. The system also featured an unusual level of support for what is now called multimedia computing, allowing analog audio and video signals (including TV and radio) to be switched to programming terminals. This switching capability for terminal video even allowed users in separate offices to view and type on the same virtual terminal, or a single user to instantly switch among multiple full virtual terminals. Also invented there were \\"bucky bits\\" - thus, the \\"Alt\\" key on every IBM PC is a WAITS legacy. One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was a news-wire search engine called NS (for News Service) that allowed WAITS hackers to instantly find, store and be notified about selected AP and New York Times news-wire stories by doing searches using arbitrary combinations of words. News story retrieval by such search was instantaneous because each story was automatically indexed by all its words when it came in over the wire.

Described in The Herald as \\"one of Scotland's most prominent socialists\\", he is a founding member of the SSP and Scotland's longest-serving party leader or spokesperson, having been originally elected as the SSP's convener in February 2005. He was a member of the Yes Scotland Advisory Board. Personal life Fox was born in Motherwell. Both of his grandfathers were steelworkers, his mother was a nurse and his father an insurance salesman with the Co-operative Insurance Society. He attended Our Lady's High School before studying Mathematics at Strathclyde University and Accountancy at Bell's College, Hamilton (now part of the University of the West of Scotland). He graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Social Sciences from the Open University in 2013. Colin currently lives in Edinburgh, with his partner and children. Political career Fox joined the Labour Party in Motherwell and Wishaw as a teenager and established Labour Party Young Socialists (LPYS) branches throughout Lanarkshire. He has described Tony Benn as \\"one of my heroes\\", and says that it was after attending a talk given by Benn at the University of Glasgow, when Benn was running for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party, that he was inspired to get involved in politics full-time. As a prominent LPYS activist, he attracted the attention of the Militant tendency, and joined in 1981. He was elected as their Lanarkshire organiser in 1983 and has been heavily involved in socialist politics ever since. He was active in the 1984‚Äì85 miners' strike in Ayrshire and at the Ravenscraig picket line. The 103-day Caterpillar occupation of 1987‚Äì88 saw him involved in the key industrial battle of the time. In 1988, he went to London to work for Militant at its headquarters in Hackney Wick. He held a variety of posts in its industrial department, finance department, and as circulation manager of the Militant newspaper. Here, he was heavily involved in the leadership of the anti-poll tax struggle which brought down Margaret Thatcher. In 1995, he moved to Edinburgh to take up the role of Scottish Militant Labour's East of Scotland organiser. This was the time when Militant was discarding its entryist tactics and turning towards open mass work. As a member of SML's executive committee, he was heavily involved in the discussions with some smaller groups on the left that led to the formation of the Scottish Socialist Alliance (SSA) in 1995. The SSA aimed to build a left- wing alternative to New Labour and the SNP. It was built around the slogan \\"for an independent socialist Scotland\\". Fox was the SSA's East of Scotland organiser, a role he continued to play when the Alliance morphed into the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in 1998. An MSP in Holyrood He led the Scottish Socialist Party in the Lothians into the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999. This was the election where Tommy Sheridan, then an SML councillor, was elected as the SSP MSP for Glasgow region. Over the course of the next four years, Colin helped build the SSP as it trebled in size. The party in parliament succeeded in passing legislation to abolish poindings and warrant sales in 2002. Using Sheridan's popularity, the SSP made several interventions including supporting the Fire Brigades Union dispute of 2002. But above all, it was the role the party played in the huge movement against the Iraq War that cemented the SSP's place in Scottish politics. Against pundits' predictions, the SSP won six seats at Holyrood in 2003, including Colin Fox MSP in the Lothians region. Winning by just 68 votes out of 300,000, Fox was famously captured on TV hurtling across the floor of Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh when his result was finally declared. Like his SSP colleagues, Fox refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen and was ejected from the swearing-in ceremony for singing Robert Burns' anthem Is There for Honest Poverty (or A Man's a Man for A' That) in protest. He sat on the Scottish Parliament's justice committee for four years and visited many of Scotland's prisons, arguing for reform. He presented a Member's Bill, one of only six to get to the debating floor that session, to abolish NHS prescription charges in Scotland. The bill won the backing of the parliament's health committee, but was eventually voted down by Labour, Conservative, and Lib Dem MSPs. The Scottish Government of 2007‚Äì11 later picked up the bill and introduced it themselves. Sheridan's defamation action In November 2004, the party's then national convenor, Tommy Sheridan MSP, chose to sue a tabloid newspaper over stories it published about his private life. Sheridan's decision to sue the News of the World, against the advice of the SSP executive committee, led to it demanding his resignation as convenor. Sheridan lied throughout two high-profile trials and was eventually sentenced to three years in jail, convicted on five counts of perjury. On one occasion, Sheridan asked Fox to lie on his behalf by writing to his solicitor saying minutes of a party meeting where Sheridan admitted going to a swingers' club were false. Fox refused and told Sheridan his strategy was a \\"train wreck\\". Colin Fox later summarised Sheridan's conduct by saying he had \\"done more damage to the socialist cause than any good he ever did it\\". Fox was subsequently elected SSP national convener in Sheridan's place, defeating Alan McCombes by 252 votes to 154, but the damage done to the party by the Glasgow MSP was substantial. In response to Tony Blair's plans to bring in variable top-up fees at English universities, Fox commented that previous student politicians, such as Jack Straw and Charles Clarke, \\"were only able to be active in student politics because they didn't have ¬£10,000 of debt hanging round their neck and they didn't have to rush off to work in McDonald's\\". He added: \\"Now they are kicking the ladder away from the people below them.\\" In June 2005, Fox took part in a peaceful protest, interrupting Question Time in the Scottish Parliament, along with three other SSP MSPs, to highlight their claim that parliament had failed to secure the right to demonstrate outside the Gleneagles Hotel where the G8 were meeting. As a consequence, he was suspended from the Scottish Parliament for the whole of September and the salaries of the party's four MSPs and their staff were stoppedthe severest penalty meted out to any peaceful protest in British parliamentary history. Exit from parliament Fox lost his seat in the Scottish Parliament at the 2007 election, but continued to lead the party, campaigning on issues including Scottish independence, fuel poverty, bankers' bonuses, the occupation of Afghanistan, climate change, equal marriage, AIDS, and education cuts. He has contested a number of elections since 2007, standing as his party's top candidate in the 2009 European elections, in the Lothians region for the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007 and 2011, and against Alistair Darling in Edinburgh South West at the 2010 United Kingdom general election. In 2007, he supported Greenpeace on board their ship Arctic Sunrise in their campaign against the replacement of the UK's nuclear weapons. He had previously visited a nuclear power station on the grounds that \\"I am a convinced opponent of nuclear power but an opponent who wants to conduct the debate about new nuclear capacity and our energy needs on the basis of facts. My visit to Torness is at my own request.\\" In the same year he championed the cause of affordable access to housing with his support of Midlothian Council's investment in providing housing. In 2008, he wrote to the First Minister Alex Salmond seeking an assurance that any future meetings with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly would raise the issue of attitudes towards LGBT rights by its ministers. More recently he has also been involved in opposing community education cuts, and has marched against cuts to public services. In 2012, Fox was invited to join the Yes Scotland Advisory Board as a representative of the SSP when the campaign was launched. Independence referendum As a Yes Scotland Advisory Board member, Colin Fox was in great demand to speak at public meetings on the details of independence all across Scotland. He has shared platforms with Jim Sillars, John McAllion, John Finnie MSP, Jean Urquhart MSP, and Patrick Harvie MSP of the Scottish Green Party. He wrote the SSP's pamphlets The Case for an Independent Socialist Scotland and For a Modern Democratic Republic. Fox addressed independence rallies in Edinburgh in 2012 and 2013, and spoke at the Oxford Union in May 2014 debating the motion: \\"This House believes Scotland should be an independent country\\". His opponents in the debate included Lord Jim Wallace and the Labour MP for Stirling, Anne McGuire. In June 2014, Fox wrote in the Scotsman: \\"No country in the world is more engaged in the democratic debate over self-determination than Scotland today. September‚Äôs referendum has energised people to a remarkable extent with debates on the 'democratic deficit' at the heart of Scottish politics now taking place in households, schools, workplaces, village halls and urban community centres from one end of the country to the other.\\" After the referendum When the make-up of the Smith Commission was announced after the rejection of independence, Colin Fox protested the decision to \\"uniquely exclude\\" the SSP from proceedings. He wrote to the Smith Commission: \\"The argument some use to justify our exclusion on the grounds that we currently have no 'parliamentary representation' fails to appreciate that the referendum was not a parliamentary process but an unprecedented public debate that resulted in an extraordinary level of engagement from all sections of society. To exclude the SSP is to exclude an important constituency of opinion in Scottish society.\\" In January 2015, Fox travelled to Athens as a guest of Syriza before its victory in the January 2015 Greek legislative election. He met with Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias Turri√≥n, and said the election result was \\"something for socialists in Scotland to ponder deeply\\". Other activities Fox is the founder and current director of the Edinburgh People's Festival. In October 2008, Fox stood for Rector of the University of St Andrews. He came second, losing to Kevin Dunion. He was asked to run for the position by members of St Andrews-based student groups such as Stop The War, due to his previous experience with the pro-peace and social justice movements. After losing the rectorial election in 2008, he maintained his links with the University and visited a student sit-in protest in 2009. He was invited to stand for election as rector again in 2011.

Port of Albany Albany, 1874 by Sir Whately Eliot York Street in the centre of Albany Saint Joseph Catholic Church in Albany Albany () is a port city in the Great Southern region in the Australian state of Western Australia, southeast of Perth, the state capital. Albany is the oldest colonial settlement in Western Australia, predating Perth and Fremantle by over two years. The city centre is at the northern edge of Princess Royal Harbour, which is a part of King George Sound. The central business district is bounded by Mount Clarence to the east and Mount Melville to the west. The city is in the local government area of the City of Albany. The Albany settlement was founded on 26 December 1826, as a military outpost of New South Wales as part of a plan to forestall French ambitions in the region. To that end, on 21 January 1827, the commander of the outpost, Major Edmund Lockyer, formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown. During the last decade of the 19th century the town served as a gateway to the Eastern Goldfields. For many years, it was the colony's only deep-water port, having a place of eminence on shipping services between Britain and its Australian colonies. The opening of the Fremantle Inner Harbour in 1897,Hutchison, D., Fremantle Walks, Fremantle Arts Centre Press, Fremantle, 2006, pp. 51‚Äì55. however, saw its importance as a port decline, after which the town's industries turned primarily to agriculture, timber and later, whaling. Today as a city it is the southern terminus for tourism in the region, and the state's South West, which is known for its natural environment and preservation of heritage. The town has a role in the ANZAC legend, being the last port of call for troopships departing Australia in the First World War. On 1 November 2014 the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers opened the National Anzac Centre in Mount Clarence, Albany, to commemorate 100 years since the first ANZAC troops departed from King George Sound. Approximately 40,000 people attended the commemoration events held between 30 October and 2 November 2014. Also an auxiliary submarine base for the US Navy's 7th Fleet was developed during the Second World War in the event the submarine base at Fremantle was lost.

Etymology Upon its establishment in 1826, the Albany settlement was named Frederick Town in honour of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. In 1831, the settlement was transferred to the control of the Swan River Colony and renamed Albany by Lieutenant-Governor James Stirling.West, D.A.P., The Settlement on the Sound ‚Äì Discovery and settlement of the Albany Region 1791‚Äì1831, Western Australian Museum, Perth, 1976, reprinted 2004. pp. 55‚Äì115. The name of the area in the Nyungar language of the local indigenous Menang people is Kinjarling, which has been said to mean \\"place of plenty\\" and \\"place of rain\\". In 2020, the City of Albany began, as part of an official dual- naming project, to give prominence to Kinjarling as the city's indigenous name. Early history Kinjarling was home to Menang Noongar indigenous tribes during the summer season. The Menang people would sometimes camp near \\"Boondie Yokine\\" ‚Äì roughly translated as Dog Rock.The Amity Heritage Precinct www.museum.wa.gov.au. Retrieved 3 August 2007. Early European explorers discovered evidence of fish traps located on Emu Point and on the French, now the Kalgan, River. Vancouver made attempts to find the inhabitants of the area but only found bark dwellings that were unoccupied. Later explorers made contact and were told to leave, but were accepted when they did not. Most of the exploration was made to survey the land and sea and assess the resources for further exploitation. The explorers only occasionally noted the Noongars they encountered. Native treatment laws and programs have affected the tribes since settlement.

The species is endemic to the island Mauritius. It typically inhabits warm and humid places and dwells on different trees and bushes. Etymology The specific name, cepediana, is in honor of French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de.Beolens, Bo, Michael Watkins and Michael Grayson (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Phelsuma cepediana, p. 149). Description Specimen on tree in Mauritius P. cepediana belongs to the middle-sized day geckos. It can reach a total length (including tail) of about . There always is a dorso-lateral stripe present, which may be broken. A red stripe extends from the nostril to the shoulder. The male body colour is light green or bluish green. The backs of males have a bright blue colour and are covered with dark red spots and dashes. The males have deep blue tails. Females lack the brilliant blue colour of the males. They have a bright green back and rust-coloured spots. Distribution The blue-tailed day gecko inhabits the island Mauritius where it is widely distributed. P. cepediana may also have been introduced to Madagascar where it has been reported a few times, amongst others in the region of Iviloina. These observations have not been confirmed though. Habitat P. cepediana is mainly found on bushes and trees such as coconut palms, traveler's palms, banana trees and papayas. It also inhabits gardens and houses in suburban areas. It prefer a moist and warm climate. McKeown (1993) mentions that the original vegetation of Mauritius has been largely replaced with agricultural crops in which this day gecko cannot live. Diet The blue-tailed day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also licks soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar. The flowers of the now critically endangered liana Roussea simplex produce copious amounts of nectar and are pollinated only by the blue-tailed day gecko. The blue-tailed day gecko later on plays a role by licking up a gelatinous substance secreted by the fruit which contains the minute seeds. It disperses the seeds in its droppings. Regrettably, the 2 mm long ant Technomyrmex albipes that was introduced to Mauritius from the Indo-Pacific area seals the flowers of Roussea with clay to protect mealy bugs. These drink the sap and excrete a sugary urine that is collected by the ants. The ants attack animals that visit the plant, preventing the blue-tailed day gecko from pollinating the flowers and eating from the fruit, and in this way seriously hampering Roussea's reproduction. Behavior This Phelsuma species can be quite aggressive both toward its own and to other Phelsuma species. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female. In this case the male and female must be separated. Reproduction The females of P. cepediana lay eggs in a protected location, and glue the eggs. At a temperature of , the young will hatch after approximately 40-45 days. The juveniles measure . Care and maintenance in captivity P. cepediana should be housed in pairs and needs a large, well planted terrarium. It is important to provide the terrarium with sufficient air flow. The temperature should be between 28 and . The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100 per cent. In captivity, the blue-tailed day gecko can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruits flies, mealworms, and houseflies. References Further reading * *Henkel, F.-W., and W. Schmidt (1995).

In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design. Another related measure is the payload fraction, which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload. It can be applied to a vehicle, a stage of a vehicle or to a rocket propulsion system. Formulation The propellant mass fraction is given by: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\zeta &= \\\\frac{m_\\\\text{p}}{m_0} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] &= \\\\frac{m_0 - m_\\\\text{f}}{m_0} = \\\\frac{m_\\\\text{p}}{m_\\\\text{p} + m_\\\\text{f}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 1 - \\\\frac{m_\\\\text{f}}{m_0} \\\\end{align} Where: :\\\\zeta is the propellant mass fraction :m_0 = m_\\\\text{f} + m_\\\\text{p} is the initial mass of the vehicle :m_\\\\text{p} is the propellant mass :m_\\\\text{f} is the final mass of the vehicle Significance In rockets for a given target orbit, a rocket's mass fraction is the portion of the rocket's pre-launch mass (fully fueled) that does not reach orbit. The propellant mass fraction is the ratio of just the propellant to the entire mass of the vehicle at takeoff (propellant plus dry mass). In the cases of a single stage to orbit (SSTO) vehicle or suborbital vehicle, the mass fraction equals the propellant mass fraction; simply the fuel mass divided by the mass of the full spaceship. A rocket employing staging, which are the only designs to have reached orbit, has a mass fraction higher than the propellant mass fraction because parts of the rocket itself are dropped off en route. Propellant mass fractions are typically around 0.8 to 0.9. In aircraft, mass fraction is related to range, an aircraft with a higher mass fraction can go farther. Aircraft mass fractions are typically around 0.5. When applied to a rocket as a whole, a low mass fraction is desirable, since it indicates a greater capability for the rocket to deliver payload to orbit for a given amount of fuel. Conversely, when applied to a single stage, where the propellant mass fraction calculation doesn't include the payload, a higher propellant mass fraction corresponds to a more efficient design, since there is less non-propellant mass. Without the benefit of staging, SSTO designs are typically designed for mass fractions around 0.9. Staging increases the payload fraction, which is one of the reasons SSTOs appear difficult to build. For example, the complete Space Shuttle system has:Typical propellant mass fractions * fueled weight at liftoff: 1,708,500 kg * dry weight at liftoff: 342,100 kg Given these numbers, the propellant mass fraction is 1 - (342,100\\\\text{ kg}/1,708,500\\\\text{ kg}) = 0.7998. The mass fraction plays an important role in the rocket equation: :\\\\Delta v = -v_\\\\text{e} \\\\ln\\\\frac{m_\\\\text{f}}{m_0} Where m_\\\\text{f}/m_0 is the ratio of final mass to initial mass (i.e., one minus the mass fraction), \\\\Delta v is the change in the vehicle's velocity as a result of the fuel burn and v_\\\\text{e} is the effective exhaust velocity (see below). The term effective exhaust velocity is defined as: :v_\\\\text{e} = g_\\\\text{n} I_\\\\text{sp} where Isp is the fuel's specific impulse in seconds and gn is the standard acceleration of gravity (note that this is not the local acceleration of gravity). To make a powered landing from orbit on a celestial body without an atmosphere requires the same mass reduction as reaching orbit from its surface, if the speed at which the surface is reached is zero.

Jordan (April 1, 1923 ‚Äì September 10, 1965) was an American actor, most notable for being a member of the Dead End Kids, the East Side Kids, and The Bowery Boys. Biography Early life and career Born in Harrison, New York, Jordan was a talented toddler and could sing, tap dance, and play the saxophone by the time he was six years old. At the age of four, he was working in an early movie version of A Christmas Carol. His mother took him to talent shows in and around Harrison, New York. He also modeled for newspaper and magazine advertisements and appeared in short films and radio programs. In the late 1920s, his family moved to the upper west side of Manhattan. In 1929, he was cast as Charles Hildebrand in the 1929 Broadway play Street Scene. Dead End Kids and East Side Kids Though he was the youngest, Jordan was the first of the boys who made up the Dead End Kids to work in films with a role in a 1933 Universal short. In 1935, he became one of the original Dead End Kids by winning the role of Angel in Sydney Kingsley's Broadway drama Dead End about life in the slums of the east side of New York City. The play was performed at the Belasco Theatre and ran for three years with over 600 performances. He appeared for the first season and the beginning of the second but left in mid-November 1936. He returned in time to join the others in 1937 in Hollywood, California to make the movie version of the play, starring big names such as Humphrey Bogart, Joel McCrea, Sylvia Sidney, and Claire Trevor. Following the making of Dead End, Jordan found himself \\"released\\" from his contract at Goldwyn, and subsequently, he appeared at Warner Brothers with the rest of the Dead End Kids. After one year, Warners released most of them, but kept Leo Gorcey and Jordan as solo performers. Jordan appeared (as Douglas Fairbanks Rosenbloom) in Warner's Damon Runyon comedy A Slight Case of Murder (1938) and at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Young Tom Edison (1940). In 1940, Jordan appeared in the movie Military Academy and accepted an offer from producer Sam Katzman to star in a new tough-kid series titled \\"The East Side Kids.\\" Leo Gorcey soon joined him, then Huntz Hall, and the trio continued to lead the series until 1943 when Jordan entered the United States Army during World War II as a foot soldier in the 97th Infantry Division. He subsequently was involved in an elevator accident that forced him to have surgery to remove his right kneecap. Later career and personal life When Jordan returned to films in 1945, he found that his former gang-mates Gorcey and Hall were obtaining the lion's share of both the content and the salary for the new Bowery Boys film series. Dissatisfied with his background status, he left the series after eight entries, and made only a few films thereafter. On July 1, 1957, Jordan played Bob Ford, the assailant of Jesse James, in the television series Tales of Wells Fargo. The episode ends some two months before Ford assassinated James in the latter's residence in St. Joseph, Missouri. One of his later performances was in an episode of Bonanza titled \\"The Many Faces of Gideon Flinch\\", where he played one of Bullet Head Burke's men. In subsequent years, Jordan worked as a bartender, a bad choice for him considering his alcoholism. He worked to support his family as a door-to-door photograph salesman and as a roughneck for an oil driller. In 1957, Jordan and his wife divorced. Death On August 25, 1965, he entered the Veterans Hospital in Sawtelle, California for treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. He died on September 10, 1965 at the age of 42. His former Dead End Kid and East Side Kid co-star Leo Gorcey once observed \\"Bobby Jordan must not have had a guardian angel.

The population in 2011 was 1,206; the town has been shrinking in size since the 1950s when the town reached its peak of 3,000 inhabitants. The municipalities of √ìlafsfj√∂r√∞ur and Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, connected since 2010 by the H√©√∞insfj√∂r√∞ur Tunnels, merged in 2006 to form a municipality called Fjallabygg√∞, which literally means Mountain Settlement. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur is the site of The Herring Era Museum, a maritime museum which opened in 1994.\\"Around Iceland 2015: Fjallabygg√∞\\", Iceland Monitor, Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 9 September 2015.  History  The town grew up around the herring industry that was very strong in the 1940s and 1950s. Herring fishing is no longer productive in the region. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur was connected with a road for the first time in 1940, when the horse riding trail through was improved enabling cars to get through. Before that ships, seaplanes, horses and strong legs provided the transport.  Current  Today the town remains dependent on fishing industries. The government of Iceland is attempting to reverse the population shrinking in the area by improving land transportation. The dual H√©√∞insfj√∂r√∞ur Tunnels, with a total length of , were dug between Siglufj√∂r√∞ur and √ìlafsfj√∂r√∞ur to connect with the region of Eyjafj√∂r√∞ur in the east, and opened on 2 October 2010. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur was already connected by the 800 m Str√°kar Tunnel to the west; it used to be the town's only road connection open year- round. That tunnel was completed in 1967 and before then the only road to the town was a narrow mountain pass between Siglufj√∂r√∞ur and H√©√∞insfj√∂r√∞ur, open only during the summer. The new tunnel opened interesting mountain tracks and trout fishing opportunities to those without boats and unwilling to walk the old trail. The old road to Siglufj√∂r√∞ur is open during the summer. It is the highest mountain road in Iceland and is used today for hiking, horseriding and pleasure driving.  In popular culture  Baltasar Korm√°kur's 2015 TV series \\"√ìf√¶r√∞ (Trapped)\\" was filmed almost entirely in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur, with the exception of a few outdoor scenes shot in the Eastfjords and Reykjav√≠k. The town is also the setting of Ragnar J√≥nasson's detective series entitled \\"Dark Iceland\\".The new hotel at Siglufj√∂r√∞ur Air transport There have not been regular flights to Siglufj√∂r√∞ur for many years, but private small planes make frequent landings. The closest airport with scheduled flights is in Akureyri, an hour's drive from Siglufj√∂r√∞ur. Daylight hours Siglufj√∂r√∞ur experiences midnight sun from 9 June until 1 July. Siglufj√∂r√∞ur does not experience polar night at the December solstice; the shortest daylight hours in Siglufj√∂r√∞ur is 2 hours 39 minutes, from 11:54 UTC until 14:33 UTC on 21 December.

Formerly the capital of the Netherlands Antilles prior to its dissolution in 2010, it has an estimated population of 150,000. The historic centre of the city consists of four quarters: the Punda and Otrobanda, which are separated by the Sint Anna Bay, an inlet that leads into the large natural harbour called the Schottegat, as well as the Scharloo and Pietermaai Smal quarters, which are across from each other on the smaller Waaigat harbour. Willemstad is home to the Cura√ßao synagogue, the oldest surviving synagogue in the Americas. The city centre, with its unique architecture and harbour entry, has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Punda was established in 1634, when the Dutch captured the island from Spain. The original name of Punda was de punt in Dutch. Otrobanda, which was founded in 1707, is the newer section of the city and is considered to be the cultural centre of Willemstad. Its name originated from the Papiamentu otro banda, which means \\"the other side\\". The Cura√ßao synagogue was built by Sephardic Portuguese Jews from Amsterdam and Recife, Brazil.

What is of note is the fact that the fort has a strategic inner and outer wall and ditch. The remains today are still clearly visible despite the fact that the once twenty-feet-odd walls now stand at around five feet due to its use in the 19th century as a quarry for buildings in Penzance and Madron. The freehold of the land beneath part of the castle was put up for auction in April 1883 as part of freehold tenement of Little Bosullow. Included was large quantities of good building stone. The fort was excavated in 1895, 1925, 1927 and 1930. Much pottery was uncovered, the earliest dating to the 4th century BC due to its similarity to known Breton pottery of that age. However, it is possible that the fort was built upon a much older structure. Ch√ªn Quoit, around 800 feet to the west, is dated to around 2400BC. It is believed that the fort fell into disuse around the first century AD but was reoccupied and modified several centuries later, until the 6th century. However, occupation may also date to the later Roman period. The purpose of the fort is speculated to be for protection of tin and copper gathered in the tin-rich locality of what is now Pendeen, with its Geevor Tin Mine, and surrounding villages. Iron and tin slags were found within the castle, near the well. It overlooks many miles of ocean, the Celtic Sea, to the north, and overlooks the only land route to this peninsula (West Penwith) to the south. Therefore, not only its structure but its location suggest a much more actively militaristic function. The well, within the inner walls, is of note as it once had a stairway leading to the water, water which remains to this day even during dry spells. Locals used the well water until the 1940s for domestic purposes and some for superstitious reasons, viz. the endowment of perpetual youth. Neopagans still make pilgrimages to the site on religiously significant days.

Plant  Leaves and flower buds The shrubby plant is many-branched, with alternate leaves, thick and shiny, round to ovate. The flowers are complete, sweetly fragrant, and showy, with four sepals and four white to pinkish-white petals, and many long violet-colored stamens, and a single stigma usually rising well above the stamens.  Environmental requirements  Thorny caper flower in Nahal Neqarot, southern Israel Open ripe caper fruit The caper bush requires a semiarid or arid climate. The caper bush has developed a series of mechanisms that reduce the impact of high radiation levels, high daily temperature, and insufficient soil water during its growing period.Rhizopoulou, S. 1990. Physiological responses of Capparis spinosa L. to drought. Journal of Plant Physiology 136, 341‚Äì348Levizou, E; P Drilias; Kyparissis, A. (2004) Exceptional photosynthetic performance of Capparis spinosa L. under adverse conditions of Mediterranean summer. Photosynthetica 42, 229‚Äì235. The caper bush has a curious reaction to sudden increases in humidity; it forms wart- like pock marks across the leaf surface. This is apparently harmless, as the plant quickly adjusts to the new conditions and produces unaffected leaves. It also shows characteristics of a plant adapted to poor soils. This shrub has a high root/shoot ratio and the presence of mycorrhizae serves to maximize the uptake of minerals in poor soils. Different nitrogen-fixing bacterial strains have been isolated from the caper bush rhizosphere, playing a role in maintaining high reserves of that growth-limiting element.  Cultivation  The caper bush has been introduced as a specialized culture in some European countries in the last four decades. The economic importance of the caper plant led to a significant increase in both the area under cultivation and production levels during the late 1980s. The main production areas are in harsh environments found in Iraq, Morocco, the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, Turkey, the Greek island of Santorini and the Italian island of Pantelleria and the Aeolian Islands, especially Salina. Capers from Pantelleria and Aelian island are recognized as European PGI products. This species has developed special mechanisms to survive in the Mediterranean conditions, and introduction in semiarid lands may help to prevent the disruption of the equilibrium of those fragile ecosystems. A harvest duration of at least three months is necessary for profitability. Intense daylight and a long growing period are necessary to secure high yields. The caper bush can withstand temperatures over 40¬∞C in summer, but it is sensitive to frost during its vegetative period. A caper bush is able to survive low temperatures in the form of stump, as happens in the foothills of the Alps. Caper plants are found even 3,500 m above sea level in Ladakh, though they are usually grown at lower altitudes. Some Italian and Argentine plantings can withstand strong winds without problems, due to the plant's decumbent architecture and the coriaceous consistency of the leaves in some populations. The known distributions of each species can be used to identify the origin of commercially prepared capers. The caper bush is a rupicolous species.Sozzi, G O (2008). Capparis spinosa, caper bush, pp. 227-232. In: J Janick and RE Paull (Eds.), The Encyclopedia of Fruit and Nuts. CABI Publishing, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. It is widespread on rocky areas and is grown on different soil associations, including alfisols, regosols, and lithosols. In different Himalayan locations, C. spinosa tolerates both silty clay and sandy, rocky, or gravelly surface soils, with less than 1% organic matter. It grows on bare rocks, crevices, cracks, and sand dunes in Pakistan, in dry calcareous escarpments of the Adriatic region, in dry coastal ecosystems of Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, in transitional zones between the littoral salt marsh and the coastal deserts of the Asian Red Sea coast, in the rocky arid bottoms of the Jordan valley, in calcareous sandstone cliffs at Ramat Aviv, Israel, and in central west and northwest coastal dunes of Australia. It grows spontaneously in wall joints of antique Roman fortresses, on the Western Wall of Jerusalem's Temple Mount, and on the ramparts of the castle of Santa B√°rbara (Alicante, Spain). Clinging caper plants are dominant on the medieval limestone-made ramparts of Alcudia and the bastions of Palma (Majorca, Spain). This aggressive pioneering has brought about serious problems for the protection of monuments.  Propagation  Flowering caper plant, soon to yield caper berries Capers can be grown easily from fresh seeds gathered from ripe fruit and planted into well-drained seed-raising mix. Seedlings appear in two to four weeks. Old, stored seeds enter a state of dormancy and require cold stratification to germinate. The viable embryos germinate within three to four days after partial removal of the lignified seed coats. The seed coats and the mucilage surrounding the seeds may be ecological adaptations to avoid water loss and conserve seed viability during the dry season. Use of stem cuttings avoids high variability in terms of production and quality. Nevertheless, plants grown from cuttings are more susceptible to drought during the first years after planting. The caper bush is a difficult-to-root woody species, and successful propagation requires careful consideration of biotypes and seasonal and environmental parameters. Rootings up to 55% are possible when using one- year-old wood, depending on cutting harvest time and substrate used. Propagation from stem cuttings is the standard method for growing ‚ÄòMallorquina‚Äô and ‚ÄòItaliana‚Äô in Spain, and ‚ÄòNocella‚Äô in the Aolian Islands, esp. Salina. Hardwood cuttings vary in length from 15 to 50 cm and diameter of the cuttings may range from 1.0 to 2.5 cm. Another possibility is to collect stems during February through the beginning of March, treat them with captan or captafol and stratify them outdoors or in a chamber at 3‚Äì4 ¬∞C, covered with sand or plastic. Moisture content and drainage should be carefully monitored and maintained until planting. Using semihardwood cuttings, collected and planted during August and September, low survival rates (under 30%) have been achieved. Softwood cuttings are prepared in April from 25- to 30-day shoots. Each cutting should contain at least two nodes and be six to 10 cm long. Basal or subterminal cuttings are more successful than terminal ones. Then, cuttings are planted in a greenhouse under a mist system with bottom heat; 150 to 200 cuttings/m2 may be planted.  Orchard establishment  Mean annual temperatures in areas under cultivation are over 14 ¬∞C and rainfall varies from 200 mm/year in Spain to 460 mm/year in Pantelleria and 680 mm/year in Salina. In Pantelleria, it rains only 35 mm from May through August, and 84 mm in Salina, the Aeolian Islands. A rainy spring and a hot dry summer are considered advantageous.Barbera, B. (1991). Le c√¢prier (Capparis spp.). EUR 13617, S√©rie Agriculture, Programme de recherche Agrimed. Commission des Communaut√©s europ√©ennes, Luxembourg, 63 pp. This drought-tolerant perennial plant is used for landscaping and reducing erosion along highways, steep rocky slopes, sand dunes or fragile semiarid ecosystems. Caper plantings over 25 to 30 years old are still productive.Luna Lorente, F; M P√©rez Vicente (1985). La Tapenera o Alcaparra: Cultivo y Aprovechamiento. Publicaciones de Extensi√≥n Agraria, Colecci√≥n Agricultura Pr√°ctica 37. Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentaci√≥n, Madrid, Espa√±a, 125 pp. Thus, physical properties of the soil (texture and depth) are particularly important. Caper bushes can develop extensive root systems and grow best on deep, nonstratified, medium-textured, loamy soils. Mouldboard plowing and harrowing are usual practices prior to caper plant establishment. Soil-profile modification practices, such as deep plowing operating 0.6 to 1 m, can ameliorate some restrictions. In Pantelleria, digging backhoe pits for each shrub was found to be the most effective means of cultivating caper in rocky soils. Two planting designs are used, the square/rectangle and the hedgerow system. Spacing is determined by the vigour of the biotype, fertility of the soil, equipment used and the irrigation method, if any. Bush spacing of 2.5 √ó 2.5 m or 2.5 √ó 2 m is common in Pantelleria. In Salina, the Aeolian Islands, 3 √ó 3 m is satisfactory for ‚ÄòNocella‚Äô. In Spain, 4 √ó 4 m or 5 √ó 5 m is satisfactory for ‚ÄòMallorquina‚Äô. Spacing of 2.0 to 2.5 m is appropriate if C. spinosa is used to control soil erosion on slopes.  Harvest  Caper buds are usually picked in the morning. Because the youngest, smallest buds fetch the highest prices, daily picking is typical. Capers may be harvested from wild plants, in which case it is necessary to know that the plant is not one of the few poisonous Capparis species that look similar. The plant normally has curved thorns that may scratch the people who harvest the buds, although a few spineless varieties have been developed.  Culinary uses  Pickled capers in a jar The salted and pickled caper bud (called simply a caper) is used as an ingredient, seasoning or garnish. Capers are a common ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine, especially Cypriot, Italian, Aeolian Greek and Maltese food. The mature fruit of the caper shrub are prepared similarly and marketed as caper berries. The buds, when ready to pick, are a dark olive green and range in size from under 7mm to more than 14mm. They are picked, then pickled in salt, or a salt and vinegar solution, and drained. Intense flavor, sometimes described as being similar to black pepper or mustard, is developed as glucocapparin, a glycoside organosulfur molecule, is released from each caper bud. This enzymatic reaction leads to the formation of rutin, often seen as crystallized white spots on the surfaces of individual caper buds. Capers are a distinctive ingredient in Italian cuisine, especially in Sicilian, Aeolian and southern Italian cooking. They are commonly used in salads, pasta salads, meat dishes, and pasta sauces. Examples of uses in Italian cuisine are chicken piccata and spaghetti alla puttanesca. Capers are one of the ingredients of tartar sauce. They are often served with cold smoked salmon or cured salmon dishes (especially lox and cream cheese). Capers and caper berries are sometimes substituted for olives to garnish a martini. Capers are categorized and sold by their size, defined as follows, with the smallest sizes being the most desirable: non-pareil (up to 7 mm), surfines (7‚Äì8 mm), capucines (8‚Äì9 mm), capotes (9‚Äì11 mm), fines (11‚Äì13 mm), and grusas (14+ mm). If the caper bud is not picked, it flowers and produces a caper berry. The fruit can be pickled and then served as a Greek mezze. Caper leaves, which are hard to find outside of Greece or Cyprus, are used particularly in salads and fish dishes. They are pickled or boiled and preserved in jars with brine‚Äîlike caper buds. Dried caper leaves are also used as a substitute for rennet in the manufacturing of high-quality cheese.Mike, Tad, \\"Capers: The Flower Inside\\", Epikouria Magazine, Fall/Winter 2006 File:Taperots1.JPGPickled caperberries File:Salted capers.jpgSalted capers File:Kapernblaettersalat auf Rhodos.JPGCaper leaves, pickled or boiled, can be used as an addition to salads. File:Unami Tostada with Wasabi Kreme and Caper (4271100340).jpgToast with capers  Nutrition  Canned, pickled capers are 84% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). Preserved capers are particularly high in sodium. In a typical serving of 28 grams (one ounce), capers supply 6 calories and 35% of the Daily Value (DV) for sodium, with no other nutrients in significant content. In a 100 gram amount, the sodium content is 2960 mg or 197% DV, with vitamin K (23% DV), iron (13% DV), and riboflavin (12% DV) also having appreciable levels (table).  Other uses  Capers are sometimes used in cosmetics.  Polyphenols  Canned capers contain polyphenols, including the flavonoids quercetin (173 mg per 100 g) and kaempferol (131 mg per 100 g), as well as anthocyanins.  History  The caper was used in ancient Greece as a carminative. It is represented in archaeological levels in the form of carbonised seeds and rarely as flower buds and fruits from archaic and Classical antiquity contexts. Athenaeus in Deipnosophistae pays a lot of attention to the caper, as do Pliny (NH XIX, XLVIII.163) and Theophrastus.Fragiska, M. (2005). Wild and Cultivated Vegetables, Herbs and Spices in Greek Antiquity. Environmental Archaeology 10 (1): 73‚Äì82 Etymologically, the caper and its relatives in several European languages can be traced back to Classical Latin capparis, ‚Äúcaper‚Äù, in turn borrowed from the Greek Œ∫Œ¨œÄœÄŒ±œÅŒπœÇ, k√°pparis, whose origin (as that of the plant) is unknown but is probably Asian. Another theory links k√°pparis to the name of the island of Cyprus (ŒöœçœÄœÅŒøœÇ, K√Ωpros), where capers grow abundantly. A ripe caper fruit (caper berry) In Biblical times, the caper berry was apparently supposed to have aphrodisiac properties;Kaufmann Kohler and Henry Hyvernat, , from the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906) the Hebrew word aviyyonah (◊ê÷≤◊ë÷¥◊ô÷º◊ï÷π◊†÷∏◊î) for caperberry is closely linked to the Hebrew root ◊ê◊ë◊î (avah), meaning \\"desire\\".See e.g. Gesenius's lexicon, via Blue Letter Bible The word occurs once in the Bible, in the book of Ecclesiastes, at verse . The King James Version translates on the basis of the Hebrew root (and perhaps the metaphorical meaning):Though, as the Jewish Encyclopedia points out, the female form aviyyonah should strictly mean \\"the desiring thing\\", rather than \\"desire\\" itself. Kimhi suggested \\"soul\\". > ...the grasshopper shall be a burden, > and desire shall fail. ( KJV) The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi also gives a similar gloss ( JPR). However, ancient translations, including the Septuagint, Vulgate, Peshitta and Aquila, render the word more concretely as Œ∫Œ¨œÄœÄŒ±œÅŒπœÇ, \\"caper berry\\". Thus in the words of one modern idiomatic translation (2004), > ...the grasshopper loses its spring, > and the caper berry has no effect; ( HCSB) Of other modern versions, the New International Version (NIV) goes for \\"desire\\" ( NIV), while the New American Standard Bible (NASB) has \\"caper- berry\\" ( NASB), as did the 1917 Jewish Publication Society version ( JPS). The berries (abiyyonot) were eaten, as appears from their liability to tithes and to the restrictions of the 'Orlah. They are carefully distinguished in the Mishnah and the Talmud from the caper leaves, alin, shoots, temarot,Rashi Brachos 36a and the caper buds, capperisin (note the similarity \\"caper\\"isin to \\"caper\\");Kaf HaChaim 208 all of which were eaten as seen from the blessing requirement, and declared to be the fruit of the ·∫ìelaf or caper plant.Talmud Bavli, Brachot 36a The \\"capperisin\\" mentioned in the TalmudRashi Brachos 36a are actually referring to a shell that protected the \\"abiyyonot\\" as it grew. Talmud BavliGemara Berachot, page 36 A&B; discusses the eating of caper sepals versus caper berries, both inside the land of Israel, outside the land of Israel, and in Syria. Capers are mentioned as a spice in the Roman cookbook, Apicius. Because the youngest, smallest buds fetch the highest prices, daily picking is typical.  Alternatives  Nasturtium, marigold, and Cassia buds have sometimes been used as a substitute.

Sl√°ine () is a comic hero published for the first time in British magazine 2000 AD. Sl√°ine is a barbarian fantasy adventure series based on Celtic myths and stories which first appeared in 1983, written by Pat Mills and initially drawn by his then wife, Angela Kincaid. Most of the early stories were drawn by Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon. Other notable artists to have worked on the character include Glenn Fabry and Simon Bisley. The current artist is Simon Davis. Sl√°ine's favourite weapon is an axe called \\"Brainbiter\\". He has the power of the \\"warp spasm\\", based on the r√≠astrad or body-distorting battle frenzy of the Irish hero C√∫ Chulainn, in which earth power \\"warps\\" through his body, turning him into a terrifying, monstrously powerful figure. He is a devotee of the earth goddess Danu. Plot At the start of the series Sl√°ine was a wanderer, banished from his tribe, the Sessair. He explored the Land of the Young (Irish T√≠r na n√ìg) in the company of an unscrupulous dwarf called Ukko (Finnish for \\"old man\\", and the name of the Finnish Thunder god), fighting monsters and mercenaries in the fantasy tradition. In one early adventure he rescued a maiden, Medb from being sacrificed in a Wicker Man, only to earn her enmity ‚Äì she was a devotee of Crom Cruach, the god to whom she was to be sacrificed, and was looking forward to the experience. Her master and mentor, the ancient, rotting and insane Lord Weird Slough Feg, became the series' main villain. Following stories featured sky chariots (flying longships), dragons and prehistoric alien gods. As the series progressed, Sl√°ine returned to his tribe and became king (as had been foretold in the narrative of his first appearance), leading them against the Fomorians, a race of sea demons who were oppressing them. Then, in the landmark storyline The Horned God, Sl√°ine united the tribes of the earth goddess against Slough Feg and his allies, while his personal devotion to the goddess led to him becoming a new incarnation of the Horned God Carnun (based on the Gaulish deity Cernunnos). By the end of the story the Land of the Young is no more, and Sl√°ine is the first High King of Ireland. Sl√°ine in Simon Bisley's version. Subsequent stories saw Sl√°ine sent through time by the earth goddess to fight alongside Celtic, and other, heroes and heroines such as Boudica (with whom he fought against the Romans (and Elfric), and William Wallace), and more recently return to Ireland to defend his people against new enemies alongside his wife Niamh. These new enemies turned out to be a full Fomorian invasion led by Balor and the sadistic Moloch, murdering, raping and eating their way through Slaine's tribe until, wracked with warp-spasm, Slaine was able to take out Balor. The tribal council forced Slaine to let Moloch go, hoping he would fulfill his promise of keeping the Fomorians out of Ireland; instead, he deliberately returned to rape and murder Niamh. Wanting vengeance, Slaine abdicated the throne to go to Albion and kill Moloch, which he succeeded in doing. In his absence, his son Kai left the tribe to search for his father (eventually becoming a performer in an Albion carnival) and Ireland faced a second invasion ‚Äì \\"the dread of Europe\\", Atlanteans whose ancestors had lived in Ireland before the tribes of Danu and who had been forcibly turned into hosts ‚Äì Golamhs ‚Äì for the symbiotic Sea Demons under Lord Odacon (an offshoot of the Fomorians), who easily threw the tribes' Sky Chariots into the Otherworld. Upon Slaine's return, he found the new High King Sethor, former member of the council who had granted Moloch freedom, was willing to surrender half of Ireland to Odacon in return for the gifts of science and civilisation. Slaine was able to convince the tribal council that the demons could be killed and war was once more declared on the invaders, but it was clear that Ireland would be constantly attacked by wave after wave of Fomorian invasion. Slaine hit on the idea of having the Tribe of Danu escape to the Otherworld that their Sky Chariots had been sent to, thus freeing them from the demons and allowing the Atlanteans to settle peacefully in Ireland; both armies united against Odacon and his Sea Demons. Slaine was able to free the Atlantean leader Gael from being Odacon's Golamh by handing over Sethor to take Gael's place; and they led their armies to bolster the city of Tara. While the tribes fought a defensive battle, Slaine was sent to the Otherworld to secure the blessings of Danu for the Tribes of the Earth Goddess to settle there; this done, he returned with her power behind him and led a charge that decimated Odacon's forces. The Tribe was cast to the Otherworld in the aftermath, and Slaine assisted Gael in finally destroying Odacon and the parasitic spawn with which he had infested the outer-lying villages. With Gael as High King of Ireland and founder of the eventual Gaelic race, Slaine left to track down his son. He found Kai at a travelling funfair, and later embarked on a quest to track down Crom Dubh. Sources and influences Sl√°ine's most obvious sources are Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian and C√∫chulainn the hero of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. Mills derived much of the background to the series from Celtic mythology and European prehistory (as in part did Howard: the name Conan is Irish and is borne by a number of mythological figures).\\"Irish, Norman & Danish strains\\", \\"The Legendary Celts\\" : articles exploring Howard's use of Nordic and Celtic material; Sl√°ine himself is named after Sl√°ine mac Dela, the legendary first High King of Ireland, and his \\"warp-spasm\\" or body-distorting battle frenzy is derived from the r√≠astrad of C√∫chulainn. \\"Warp-spasm\\" is the term Thomas Kinsella used for r√≠astrad in his translation of The T√°in. His barbed spear, the gae bolga, is also borrowed from C√∫chulainn, although his favourite weapon, the axe, is more usually associated with the Vikings or Anglo-Saxons than the Celts. His patronymic, Mac Roth, is the name of the steward of Ailill and Medb, king and queen of Connacht, in the same cycle. The death of Sl√°ine's mother, Macha, while forced to run on foot in a chariot race because of her husband's boasting, is taken from the story of an Irish goddess called Macha, who was forced to run against the king's chariot while heavily pregnant for the same reason.The Debility of the Ulstermen Sl√°ine's seduction of Niamh, the king's chosen bride who was brought up in seclusion until she was of age, is reminiscent of the Irish story of Deirdre.The Exile of the Sons of Usnech Cathbad, the druid who foretells the evil consequences of Deirdre's birth and appears in several other tales of the Ulster Cycle, gives his name to Sl√°ine's chief druid. Sl√°ine's feat of crossing a raging river to visit her, weighed down by a heavy stone to prevent him from being swept away, is taken from an episode of the T√°in.\\"On the morrow a valiant hero called √öalu went and took a great flagstone on his back to go across the water. But the river turned him over and he lay with his stone on his belly. His grave and his headstone are on the road beside the stream. Lia √öalann is its name.\\" (from T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge Recension 1, ed. & trans. Cecile O'Rahilly, p. 153 Niamh is a popular Irish girl's name, and is also the name of a fairy queen from the Fenian Cycle. Her otherworld homeland, T√≠r na n√ìg (the Land of the Young), provides the name of the series' setting. Sl√°ine's goddess, Danu, and her tribes, the Tuatha D√© Danann, come from the Irish Mythological Cycle, although the worship of a universal mother goddess of the earth is not Celtic and comes from speculations about prehistoric European culture and religion by the likes of Marija Gimbutas and Robert Graves. The Horned God, Carnun, is adapted from the Gaulish antlered deity Cernunnos. Some of the religious ideas in the series are taken from Barddas, a possibly fraudulent compilation of \\"bardo-druidic\\" beliefs by the 18th century Welsh antiquarian Iolo Morganwg.\\"Gwynfyd cannot be obtained without seeing and knowing everything, but it is not possible to see or to know everything without suffering everything.\\" From Iolo Morganwg, Barddas, quoted in T. W. Rolleston, Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race Chapter 8. Compare with the quote of Cathbad in Horned God, vol 1, page 18: \\"That's all very well sire but we must look beyond this life to the higher realms... and they cannot be obtained without seing and knowing everything and, unfortunately,it's not possible to see and know everything without suffering everything\\". The origin of the name Cythrawl, given to the dimension of the \\"Dark Gods of Cythrawl\\", Sl√°ine's enemies, can be found in the same passage of Barddas. Mills divides the priests of Tir na n√ìg into two factions: the good Druids, the well known priestly class of Celtic Europe, and the evil Drunes, which name derives from the Galatian place-name Drunemeton (\\"oak- sanctuary\\"), used in the story \\"The Bride of Crom\\" as the name of the Drunes' capital.Strabo, Geography 12.5.1 Their leader, Slough Feg, is partly based on Cernunnos and partly on the paleolithic cave painting known as the Sorcerer in the Trois-Fr√®res cave in Ari√®ge, southern France.\\"...the famous 'Sorcerer of Trois Freres' is Slough Feg.\\" Pat Mills, \\"Sl√°ine: the Origins\\" (introduction), The Collected Sl√°ine, Titan Books, 1993. His acolyte, Medb, is named after the legendary queen of Connacht from the Ulster Cycle. The Drunes' god, Crom Cruach, is an Irish deity who was reputedly propitiated with human sacrifices. The practice of mass human sacrifice by burning in a Wicker Man is mentioned as a practice of the Celts of Gaul by Strabo and Julius Caesar. The enemies of the Tribes of the Earth Goddess, the Fomorians, and their leader Balor, are from the Irish mythological cycle. Other elements of the series are derived from non-Celtic mythological sources. Sl√°ine's dwarf companion is named Ukko, after the Finnish storm god. Odacon is identified in Theosophist circles \\"In a letter [Theosophist, Vol ‚àí2-, page 214] written by a learned Fellow of the Theosophical Society [F.T.S.], from the monastery of Soorb Ovaness (Armenia), the writer says that the Armenians, who, until the 4th and even the 7th centuries of the Christian era, were Parsees in religion, called themselves Haiks or descendants of King Haig. In the forgotten traditions of these people, we find that they claimed to have remained true to the teachings of Zoroaster. These they had accepted ever since Musarus Oannes or Annedotus ‚Äì the Heaven or Sun-sent (the first Odacon And Daphos, the man-fish) ‚Äî arising daily from the sea at sunrise to plunge back into it at sunset ‚Äì taught them the good doctrine, their arts and civilisation.

The novel traces the life of Bambi, a male roe deer, from his birth through childhood, the loss of his mother, the finding of a mate, the lessons he learns from his father, and the experience he gains about the dangers posed by human hunters in the forest. An English translation by Whittaker Chambers was published in North America by Simon & Schuster in 1928, and the novel has since been translated and published in over 30 languages around the world. Salten published a sequel, Bambi's Children, in 1939. The novel was well received by critics and is considered a classic, as well as one of the first environmental novels. It was adapted into a theatrical animated film, Bambi, by Walt Disney Productions in 1942, two Russian live-action adaptations in 1985 and 1986, a ballet in 1987, and a stage production in 1998. Another ballet adaptation was created by an Oregon troupe, but never premiered. Janet Schulman published a children's picture book adaptation in 2000 that featured realistic oil paintings and many of Salten's original words. Plot Bambi is a roe deer fawn born in a thicket in late spring one year. Over the course of the summer, his mother teaches him about the various inhabitants of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young. As Bambi grows older, his mother begins to leave him alone. While searching for her one day, Bambi has his first encounter with \\"He\\" - the animals' term for humans - which terrifies him. The man raises a firearm and aims at him; Bambi flees at top speed, joined by his mother. After he is scolded by a stag for crying for his mother, Bambi gets used to being alone at times. He later learns the stag is called the \\"Old Prince\\", the oldest and largest stag in the forest who is known for his cunning and aloof nature. During the winter, Bambi meets Marena, a young doe, Nettla, an old doe who no longer bears young, and two princes, Ronno and Karus. Mid-winter, hunters enter the forest, killing many animals including Bambi's mother. Gobo also disappears and is presumed dead. After this, the novel skips ahead a year, noting that Bambi, now a young adult, was cared for by Nettla and that when he got his first set of antlers he was abused and harassed by the other males. It is summer and Bambi is now sporting his second set of antlers. He is reunited with his cousin Faline. After he battles and defeats first Karus then Ronno, Bambi and Faline fall in love with each other. They spend a great deal of time together. During this time, the old Prince saves Bambi's life when he nearly runs towards a hunter imitating a doe's call. This teaches the young buck to be cautious about blindly rushing toward any deer's call. During the summer, Gobo returns to the forest having been raised by a man who found him collapsed in the snow during the hunt where Bambi's mother was killed. While his mother and Marena welcome him and celebrate him as a \\"friend\\" of man, the old Prince and Bambi pity him. Marena becomes his mate, but several weeks later Gobo is killed when he approaches a hunter in the meadow, falsely believing the halter he wore would keep him safe from all men. As Bambi continues to age, he begins spending most of his time alone, including avoiding Faline though he still loves her in a melancholic way. Several times he meets with the old Prince who teaches him about snares, shows him how to free another animal from one, and encourages him not to use trails, to avoid the traps of men. When Bambi is later shot by a hunter, the Prince shows him how to walk in circles to confuse the man and his dogs until the bleeding stops, then takes him to a safe place to recover. They remain together until Bambi is strong enough to leave the safe haven again. When Bambi has grown gray and is \\"old\\", the old Prince shows him that man is not all-powerful by showing him the dead body of a man who was shot and killed by another man. When Bambi confirms that he now understands that \\"He\\" is not all-powerful, and that there is \\"Another\\" over all creatures, the stag tells him that he has always loved him and calls him \\"my son\\" before leaving. At the end of the novel, Bambi meets with twin fawns who are calling for their mother and he scolds them for not being able to stay alone. After leaving them, he thinks to himself that the girl fawn reminded him of Faline, and that the male was promising and that Bambi hoped to meet him again when he was grown. Publication history Author Felix Salten wearing a traditional Austrian hunting outfit with a Janker jacket, hat and Gamsbart Felix Salten, himself an avid hunter, penned Bambi: Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde after World War I, targeting an adult audience. The novel was first published in Vienna in serialized form in the Neue Freie Presse newspaper from 15 August to 21 October 1922, and as a book in Germany by Ullstein Verlag in 1923, and republished in 1926 in Vienna. Translations Max Schuster, a co-founder of Simon & Schuster, became intrigued with the novel and contracted with the author to publish it in North America. Clifton Fadiman, an editor at the firm, engaged his Columbia University classmate Whittaker Chambers to translate it. Simon & Schuster published this first English edition in 1928, with illustrations by Kurt Wiese, under the title Bambi: A Life in the Woods. The New York Times praised the prose as \\"admirably translated\\". The New York Herald Tribune did not comment on the translation.Lohrke, Eugene (8 July 1928). \\"A Tone Poem.\\" New York Herald Tribune. Page K3. The scholar Sabine Str√ºmper-Krobb characterizes the translation as simplified, saying Chambers inscribed the book with cultural and ideological values of the American society, stressing family values and reducing transcendental ones. Chambers‚Äô translation has been reprinted repeatedly with different illustrations until the 2010s. A new English translation by Hannah Correll was published in 2019. Over 200 editions of the novel have been published, with almost 100 German and English editions alone, and numerous translations and reprintings in over 30 languages.Felix Salten: A Preliminary Bibliography of His Works in Translation. Retrieved 1 December 2016. It has also been published in a variety of formats, including printed medium, audiobook, Braille, and E-book formats. The original German edition was unillustrated, but since then, several illustrations have been created. Copyright dispute When Salten originally published Bambi in 1923, he did so under Germany's copyright laws, which required no statement that the novel was copyrighted. In the 1926 republication, he did include a United States copyright notice, so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1926. In 1936, Salten sold some film rights to the novel to MGM producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney for the creation of a film adaptation. After Salten's death in 1945, his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel's copyrighted status in 1954 (U.S. copyright law in effect at the time provided for an initial term of 28 years from the date of first publication in the U.S., which could be extended for an additional 28 years provided the copyright holder filed for renewal before the expiration of the initial copyright). In 1958, she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel's rights. Upon her death in 1977, the rights passed to her husband, Veit Wyler, and her children, who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house Twin Books. Twin Books and Disney disagreed on the terms and validity of Disney's original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney's continued use of the Bambi name. When the two companies were unable to reach a solution, Twin Books filed suit against Disney for copyright infringement. Disney argued that because Salten's original 1923 publication of the novel did not include a copyright notice, by American law it was immediately considered a public domain work. It also argued that as the novel was published in 1923, Anna Wyler's 1954 renewal occurred after the deadline and was invalid. The case was reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which ruled that the novel was copyrighted upon its publication in 1923, and not a public domain work then. However, in validating 1923 as the publication date, this confirmed Disney's claim that the copyright renewal was filed too late and the novel became a public domain work in 1951. Twin Books appealed the decision, and in March 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the original decision, stating that the novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was not in its home country's public domain when published, therefore the original publication date could not be used in arguing American copyright law. Instead, the 1926 publication date, the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States, is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America. Anna Wyler's renewal was therefore timely and valid, and Twin Books' ownership of the copyright was upheld. The Twin Books decision is still regarded as controversial by many copyright experts. David Nimmer, in a 1998 article, argued that the Twin Books ruling meant that an ancient Greek epic, if only published outside the U.S. without the required formalities, would be eligible for copyright protection. Although Nimmer concluded that Twin Books required this finding (within the Ninth Circuit), he characterized the result as \\"patently absurd.\\" The American copyright of the novel is currently set to expire on January 1, 2022, while in Austria and other countries of the European Union it entered the public domain on January 1, 2016. Sequel While living in exile in Switzerland, after being forced to flee Nazi-occupied Austria, Salten wrote a sequel to Bambi that follows the birth and lives of Bambi's twin offspring, Geno and Gurri. The young fawns interact with various deer, and are educated and watched over by Bambi and Faline as they grow. They also learn more about the ways of man, including both hunters and the gamekeeper seeking to protect the deer. Due to Salten's exiled status ‚Äî he had lost his Austrian publisher Paul Zsolnay Verlag ‚Äî the English translation of the novel was published first, in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill, but it would take a year before the sequel was published in the original German language in Switzerland by his new publisher. Reception Bambi was \\"hugely popular\\" after its publication, becoming a \\"book-of-the-month\\" selection and selling 650,000 copies in the United States by 1942. However, it was subsequently banned in Nazi Germany in 1936 as \\"political allegory on the treatment of Jews in Europe.\\" Many copies of the novel were burned, making original first editions rare and difficult to find. When Felix Salten visited the United States as a member of a European delegation of journalists in May‚ÄìJuly 1930, he was greeted warmly because of Bambi wherever the delegation went, as was testified by the Finnish member of the delegation, Urho Toivola. In his own travel book, Salten did not boast about this; only when describing his visit to a ‚ÄúNegro college‚Äù of Atlanta, he mentions passingly that the children praised his books. In his foreword of the novel, John Galsworthy called it a \\"delicious book - delicious not only for children but for those who are no longer so fortunate\\" and a \\"little masterpiece\\" that shows a \\"delicacy of perception and essential truth\\". He notes that while reading the galley proof of the novel while crossing the English Channel, he, his wife, and his nephew read each page in turn over the course of three hours in \\"silent absorption.\\" The New York Times reviewer John Chamberlain praised Salten's \\"tender, lucid style\\" that \\"takes you out of yourself\\". He felt that Salten captured the essence of each of the creatures as they talked, catching the \\"rhythm of the different beings who people his forest world\\" and showed particular \\"comprehension\\" in detailing the various stages of Bambi's life. He also considered the English translation \\"admirably\\" done. A reviewer for Catholic World praised the approach of the subject, noting that it was \\"marked by poetry and sympathy [with] charming reminders of German folklore and fairy tale\\". However, they disliked the \\"transference of certain human ideals to the animal mind\\" and the vague references to religious allegory. The Boston Transcript called it a \\"sensitive allegory of life\\". The Saturday Review considered it \\"beautiful and graceful\\" piece that showed a rare \\"individuality\\". The Times Literary Supplement stated that the novel is a \\"tale of exceptional charm, though untrustworthy of some of the facts of animal life.\\" Isabel Ely Lord, reviewing the novel for the American Journal of Nursing, called the novel a \\"delightful animal story\\" and Salten a \\"poet\\" whose \\"picture of the woods and its people is an unforgettable one.\\" In comparing Bambi to Salten's later work Perri‚Äîin which Bambi makes a brief cameo‚ÄîLouise Long of the Dallas Morning News considered both to be stories that \\"quietly and completely [captivate] the heart\\". Long felt the prose was \\"poised and mobile and beautiful as poetry\\" and praises Salten for his ability to give the animals seemingly human speech while not \\"[violating] their essential natures.\\" Vicky Smith of Horn Book Magazine felt the novel was gory compared to the later Disney adaptation and called it a \\"weeper\\". While criticizing it as one of the most notable anti-hunting novels available, she concedes the novel is not easily forgettable and praises the \\"linchpin scene\\" where Bambi's mother dies, stating \\"the understated conclusion of that scene, 'Bambi never saw his mother again,' masterfully evokes an uncomplicated emotional response\\". She questions Galsworthy's recommendation of the novel to sportsmen in the foreword, wondering \\"how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten's unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated.\\" In comparing the novel to the Disney film, Steve Chapple of Sports Afield felt that Salten viewed Bambi's forest as a \\"pretty scary place\\" and the novel as a whole had a \\"lot of dark adult undertones.\\" Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten's own life, Chapple felt Salten came across as \\"a little morbid, a bleeding heart of a European intellectual.\\" The Wall Street Journals James P. Sterba also considered it an \\"antifascist allegory\\" and sarcastically notes that \\"you'll find it in the children's section at the library, a perfect place for this 293-page volume, packed as it is with blood-and-guts action, sexual conquest and betrayal\\" and \\"a forest full of cutthroats and miscreants. I count at least six murderers (including three child-killers) among Bambi's associates.\\" Impact Liberal critics have argued Bambi to be one of the first environmental novels. Adaptations Film Walt Disney animated film With World War II looming, Max Schuster aided the Jewish Salten's flight from Nazi controlled Austria and Nazi Germany and helped introduce him, and Bambi, to Walt Disney Productions. Sidney Franklin, a producer and director at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, purchased the film rights in 1933, initially desiring to make a live-action adaptation of the work. Deciding such a film would be too difficult to make, he sold the rights to Walt Disney in April 1937 in hopes of it being adapted into an animated film instead. Disney began working on the film immediately, intending it to be the company's second feature-length animated film and his first to be based on a specific, recent work. The original novel, written for an adult audience, was considered too \\"grim\\" and \\"somber\\" for the young audience Disney was targeting, and with the work required to adapt the novel, Disney put production on hold while it worked on several other projects. In 1938, Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl Fallberg to develop the film's storyboards, but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on Fantasia. Finally, on 17 August 1939, production on Bambi began in earnest, although it progressed slowly due to changes in the studio personnel, location and the methodology of handling animation at the time. The writing was completed in July 1940, by which time the film's budget had swelled to $858,000. Disney was later forced to slash 12 minutes from the film before final animation, to save costs on production. Heavily modified from the original novel, Bambi was released to theaters in the United States on 8 August 1942. Disney's version severely downplays the naturalistic and environmental elements found in the novel, giving it a lighter, friendlier feeling. The addition of two new characters, Thumper the Rabbit and Flower the Skunk, two sweet and gentle forest creatures, contributed to giving the film the desired friendlier and lighter feeling. Considered a classic, the film has been called \\"the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's animation studio\\" and was named as the third best film in the animation genre of the AFI's 10 Top 10 \\"classic\\" American film genres. Russian live-action films In 1985, a Russian-language live-action adaptation, (Detstvo Bembi, lit. Bambi's Childhood), was produced and released in VHS format in the Soviet Union by Gorky Film Studios. It was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk, who also co-wrote the script with Yuri Nagibin, and featured music by Boris Petrov. Natalya 's son Ivan Burlyayev and her husband Nikolay Burlyaev starred as the young and adolescent Bambi, respectively, while Faline (renamed Falina) was portrayed by Yekaterina Lychyova as a child and Galina Belyayeva as an adult. In this adaptation, the film starts using animals, changes to using human actors, then returns to using animals for the ending. A sequel, (Yunost Bembi), lit. Bambi's Youth, followed in 1986 with Nikolay and Galina reprising their voice roles as Bambi and Falina. Featuring over 100 species of live animals and filmed in various locations in Crimea, Mount Elbrus, Latvia and Czechoslovakia, the film follows new lovers Bambi and Felina as they go on a journey in search of a life-giving flower. Both films were released to Region 2 DVD with Russian and English subtitle options by the Russian Cinema Council in 2000. The first film's DVD also included a French audio soundtrack, while the second contained French subtitles instead. Ballet The Estonian composer Lydia Auster composed the ballet Bambi in 1986 which was premi√®red in Tartu, Vanemuine theater, in 1987.Lydia Auster: Works for the Stage. Estonian Music Information Centre. The Oregon Ballet Theatre adapted Bambi into an evening-length ballet entitled Bambi: Lord of the Forest. It was slated to premiere in March 2000 as the main production for the company's 2000‚Äì2001 season. A collaboration between artistic director James Canfield and composer Thomas Lauderdale, the ballet's production was to be an interpretation of the novel rather than the Disney film. In discussing the adaptation, Canfield stated that he was given a copy of the novel as a Christmas present and found it to be a \\"classic story about coming of age and a life cycle.\\" He went on to note that the play was inspired solely by the novel and not the Disney film. After the initial announcements, the pair began calling the work The Collaboration, as Disney owns the licensing rights for the name Bambi and they did not wish to fight for usage rights. The local press began calling the ballet alternative titles, including Not-Bambi which Canfield noted to be his favorite, out of derision at Disney. Its premiere was delayed for unexplained reasons, and it has yet to be performed. Theater Playwright James DeVita, of the First Stage Children's Theater, created a stage adaptation of the novel. The script was published by Anchorage Press Plays on 1 June 1997. Crafted for young adults and teenagers and retaining the title Bambi‚ÄîA Life in the Woods, it has been produced around the United States at various venues. The script calls for an open-stage setup, and utilizes at least nine actors: five male and four female, to cover the thirteen roles. The American Alliance Theatre and Education awarded the work its \\"Distinguished Play Award\\" for an adaptation. Book In 1999, the novel was adapted into an illustrated hardback children's book by Janet Schulman, illustrated by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher, and published by Simon & Schuster as part of its \\"Atheneum Books for Young Readers\\" imprint. In the adaptation, Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel. She notes that rather than rewrite the novel, she \\"replicated Salten's language almost completely. I reread the novel a number of times and then I went through and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written.\\" Doing so retained much of the novel's original lyrical feel, though the book's brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the \\"majesty and mystery\\" found in the novel. The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible, using painted images rather than sketches. In 2002, the Schulman adaptation was released in audiobook format by Audio Bookshelf, with Frank Dolan as the reader.

Herem (, also Romanized chƒìrem, ·∏•ƒìrem) is the highest ecclesiastical censure in the Jewish community. It is the total exclusion of a person from the Jewish community. It is a form of shunning and is similar to vitandus \\"excommunication\\" in the Catholic Church. Cognate terms in other Semitic languages include the Arabic terms ·∏•arƒÅm \\"forbidden, taboo, off-limits, or immoral\\" and haram \\"set apart, sanctuary\\", and the Ge'ez word  øirm \\"accursed\\". Arguably the most famous case of a herem is that of Baruch Spinoza, the seventeenth-century philosopher. Another renowned case is the herem the Vilna Gaon ruled against the early Hassidic groups in 1777 and then again in 1781, under the charge of believing in panentheism. Other famous subjects of a herem were early Russian communists Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev. Sometime in 1918, while Ukraine was under German occupation, the rabbis of Odessa pronounced herem against Trotsky, Zinoviev, and other Jewish Bolshevik leaders.Zinoviev cynically referred to this in his eulogy of Uritsky (the chief of the Petrograd Cheka, assassinated on August 30, 1918):  Summary  Although developed from the Biblical ban, excommunication, as employed by the rabbis during Talmudic times and during the Middle Ages, became a rabbinic institution, the object of which was to preserve Jewish solidarity. A system of laws was gradually developed by rabbis, by means of which this power was limited, so that it became one of the modes of legal punishment by rabbinic courts. While it did not entirely lose its arbitrary character, since individuals were allowed to pronounce the ban of excommunication on particular occasions, it became chiefly a legal measure resorted to by a judicial court for certain prescribed offenses.  Etymology and cognate terms  The three terms herem \\"censure, excommunication\\", the devotion of enemies by annihilation\\" in the Tanakh, and the devotion of property to a kohen, are all three variant English transliterations of the same Hebrew noun. This noun comes from the semitic root ·∏§-R-M. There is also a homonym herem \\"fisherman's net\\", which appears nine times in the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh, that has no etymological connection to herem.Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew Lexicon, entries herem 1, herem 2 The Talmudic usage of herem for excommunication can be distinguished from the usage of herem described in the Tanakh in the time of Joshua and the early Hebrew monarchy, which was the practice of consecration by total annihilation at the command of God carried out against peoples such as the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the entire population of Jericho. The neglect of Saul to carry out such a command as delivered by Samuel resulted in the selection of David as his replacement.  Offenses  The Talmud speaks of twenty-four offenses that, in theory, were punishable by a form of niddui or temporary excommunication. Maimonides (as well as later authorities) enumerates the twenty-four as follows: # insulting a learned man, even after his death; # insulting a messenger of the court; # calling a fellow Jew a \\"slave\\"; # refusing to appear before the court at the appointed time; # dealing lightly with any of the rabbinic or Mosaic precepts; # refusing to abide by a decision of the court; # keeping in one's possession an animal or an object that may prove injurious to others, such as a savage dog or a broken ladder; # selling one's real estate to a non-Jew without assuming the responsibility for any injury that the non-Jew may cause his neighbors; # testifying against one's Jewish neighbor in a non-Jewish court, and thereby causing that neighbor to lose money which he would not have lost had the case been decided in a Jewish court; # a kohen shochet (butcher)Raaviah to Chullin chap. 1225, Meir of Rothenburg responsa 7 (mossad horav kook vol. 2 p. 11 who refuses to give the foreleg, cheeks and maw of kosher-slaughtered livestock to another kohen; # violating the second day of a holiday, even though its observance is only a custom; # performing work on the afternoon of the day preceding Passover; # taking the name of God in vain; # causing others to profane the name of God; # causing others to eat holy meat outside of Jerusalem; # making calculations for the calendar, and establishing festivals accordingly, outside of Israel; # putting a stumbling-block in the way of the blind, that is to say, tempting another to sin (Lifnei iver); # preventing the community from performing some religious act; # selling forbidden (\\"terefah\\") meat as permitted meat (\\"kosher\\"); # failure by a shochet to show his knife to the rabbi for examination; # purposely bringing oneself to erection; # engaging in business with one's divorced wife that will lead them to come into contact with each other; # being made the subject of scandal (in the case of a rabbi); # declaring an unjustified excommunication.  The niddui  The niddui () ban was usually imposed for a period of seven days (in Israel thirty days). If inflicted on account of money matters, the offender was first publicly warned (\\"hatra'ah\\") three times, on Monday, Thursday, and Monday successively, at the regular service in the synagogue. During the period of niddui, no one except the members of his immediate household was permitted to associate with the offender, or to sit within four cubits of him, or to eat in his company. He was expected to go into mourning and to refrain from bathing, cutting his hair, and wearing shoes, and he had to observe all the laws that pertained to a mourner. He could not be counted in the quorum for the performance of a public religious function. If he died, a stone was placed on his hearse, and the relatives were not obliged to observe the ceremonies customary at the death of a kinsman, such as the tearing of garments, etc.. It was in the power of the court to lessen or increase the severity of the niddui. The court might even reduce or increase the number of days, forbid all intercourse with the offender, and exclude his children from the schools and his wife from the synagogue, until he became humbled and willing to repent and obey the court's mandates. According to one opinion, the apprehension that the offender might leave the Jewish fold on account of the severity of the excommunication did not prevent the court from adding rigor to its punishments so as to maintain its dignity and authority (Shulkhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah, 334, 1, Rama's gloss, citing Sefer Agudah). This opinion is vehemently contested by the Taz (ibid.), who cites earlier authorities of the same opinion (Maharshal; Maharam; Mahari Mintz) and presents proof of his position from the Talmud. Additionally, the Taz notes that his edition of the Sefer Agudah does not contain the cited position.  The herem  If the offense was in reference to monetary matters, or if the punishment was inflicted by an individual, the laws were more lenient, the chief punishment being that men might not associate with the offender. At the expiration of the period the ban was raised by the court. If, however, the excommunicate showed no sign of penitence or remorse, the niddui might be renewed once and again, and finally the \\"herem,\\" the most rigorous form of excommunication, might be pronounced. This extended for an indefinite period, and no one was permitted to teach the offender or work for him, or benefit him in any way, except when he was in need of the bare necessities of life.  The nezifah  A milder form than either niddui or herem was the \\"nezifah\\" ban. (In modern Hebrew, \\"nezifah\\" generally means \\"a dressing-down\\" or \\"reading (someone) the riot act\\", i.e., a stern verbal rebuke.) This ban generally only lasted one day. During this time the offender dared not appear before him whom he had displeased. He had to retire to his house, speak little, refrain from business and pleasure, and manifest his regret and remorse. He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct on the day of nezifah was sufficient apology. But when a scholar or prominent man actually pronounced the formal niddui on one who had slighted him, all the laws of niddui applied. This procedure was, however, much discouraged by the sages, so that it was a matter of proper pride for a rabbi to be able to say that he had never pronounced the ban of excommunication. Maimonides concludes with these words the chapter on the laws of excommunication:(Mishneh Torah, Talmud Torah, vii. 13). : \\"Although the power is given to the scholar to excommunicate a man who has slighted him, it is not praiseworthy for him to employ this means too frequently. He should rather shut his ears to the words of the ignorant and pay no attention to them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said, 'Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken' (Eccl. vii. 21). This was the custom of the early pious men, who would not answer when they heard themselves insulted, but would forgive the insolent. . . . But this humility should be practised only when the insult occurs in private; when the scholar is publicly insulted, he dares not forgive; and if he forgive he should be punished, for then it is an insult to the Torah that he must revenge until the offender humbly apologizes\\"  Since the Jewish Enlightenment  Except in rare cases in the Haredi and Hasidic communities, herem stopped existing after the Haskalah, when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy, and Jews were integrated into the gentile nations in which they lived. * In 1918, the Rabbinical Council of Odessa, declared herem on Leon Trotsky and several other Jewish Bolsheviks. * In 1945, rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism (a Jewish religious movement that seeks to divorce Judaism from belief in a personal deity), was formally excommunicated by the Haredi Union of Orthodox Rabbis (Agudath HaRabonim). * In 2004, the High Court of South Africa upheld a herem against a Johannesburg businessman because he refused to pay his former wife alimony as ordered by a beth din. * A herem against members of Neturei Karta who attended the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust was declared by numerous Haredi religious leaders, including the leaders of the Satmar and Chabad Hassidic groups.

It is a colorless volatile liquid although commercial samples can be yellow due to impurities. It has a pungent odor of garlic or onions. In terms of its molecular structure, it consists of a vinyl group linked to a nitrile. It is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as polyacrylonitrile. It is reactive and toxic at low doses. Acrylonitrile was first synthesized by the French chemist Charles Moureu (1863‚Äì1929) in 1893. * See especially pp. 187‚Äì189 (\\"Nitrile acrylique ou cyanure de vinyle (Prop√®ne- nitrile)\\"). *  Occurrence  Acrylonitrile is not naturally formed in the atmosphere of Earth. However it can occur at levels up to 0.11 ppm at industrial sites. It persists in the air for up to a week. It decomposes by reacting with oxygen and hydroxyl radical to form formyl cyanide and formaldehyde. Acrylonitrile is harmful to aquatic life. Acrylonitrile has been detected in the atmosphere of Titan, a moon of Saturn. Computer simulations suggest that on Titan conditions exist such that the compound could form structures similar to cell membranes and vesicles on Earth. Production Acrylonitrile is produced by catalytic ammoxidation of propylene, also known as the SOHIO process. In 2002, world production capacity was estimated at 5 million tonnes per year. Acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide are significant byproducts that are recovered for sale. In fact, the 2008‚Äì2009 acetonitrile shortage was caused by a decrease in demand for acrylonitrile. :2CH3‚àíCH=CH2 \\\\+ 2 NH3 \\\\+ 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 CH2=CH‚ÄìC‚â°N + 6 H2O In the SOHIO process, propylene, ammonia, and air (oxidizer) are passed through a fluidized bed reactor containing the catalyst at 400‚Äì510 ¬∞C and 50‚Äì200 kPag. The reactants pass through the reactor only once, before being quenched in aqueous sulfuric acid. Excess propylene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and dinitrogen that do not dissolve are vented directly to the atmosphere, or are incinerated. The aqueous solution consists of acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, hydrocyanic acid, and ammonium sulfate (from excess ammonia). A recovery column removes bulk water, and acrylonitrile and acetonitrile are separated by distillation. Historically, one of the first successful catalysts was bismuth phosphomolybdate (Bi9PMo12O52) supported on silica as a heterogeneous catalyst. Further improvements have since been made. Emerging industrial routes Various green chemistry routes are being developed for the synthesis of acrylonitrile from renewable feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, glycerol (from biodiesel production), or glutamic acid (which can itself be produced from renewable feedstocks). The lignocellulosic route involves fermentation of the biomass to propionic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid which are then converted to acrylonitrile by dehydration and ammoxidation. The glycerol route begins with pyrolysis to acrolein, which undergoes ammoxidation to give acrylonitrile. The glutamic acid route employs oxidative decarboxylation to 3-cyanopropanoic acid, followed by a decarbonylation-elimination to acrylonitrile. Of these, the glycerol route is broadly considered to be the most viable, although current methods are still unable to compete with the SOHIO process in terms of cost. Uses Acrylonitrile is used principally as a monomer to prepare polyacrylonitrile, a homopolymer, or several important copolymers, such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), and other synthetic rubbers such as acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR). Hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile affords adiponitrile, used in the synthesis of certain nylons: :2CH2=CHCN + 2e‚àí \\\\+ 2H+ ‚Üí NCCH2CH2CH2CH2CN Small amounts are also used as a fumigant. Acrylonitrile and derivatives, such as 2-chloroacrylonitrile, are dienophiles in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions. Acrylonitrile is also a precursor in the industrial manufacture of acrylamide and acrylic acid. Health effects Acrylonitrile is highly flammable and toxic at low doses. It undergoes explosive polymerization. The burning material releases fumes of hydrogen cyanide and oxides of nitrogen. It is classified as a Class 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),\\"Re-evaluation of Some Organic Chemicals, Hydrazine and Hydrogen Peroxide\\". IARC Monographs, Volume 71 (1999) and workers exposed to high levels of airborne acrylonitrile are diagnosed more frequently with lung cancer than the rest of the population.Acrylonitrile Fact Sheet (CAS No. 107-13-1). epa.gov Acrylonitrile increases cancer in high dose tests in male and female rats and mice\\"Acrylonitrile: Carcinogenic Potency Database\\". and induces apoptosis in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. It evaporates quickly at room temperature (20 ¬∞C) to reach dangerous concentrations; skin irritation, respiratory irritation, and eye irritation are the immediate effects of this exposure. Pathways of exposure for humans include emissions, auto exhaust, and cigarette smoke that can expose the human subject directly if they inhale or smoke. Routes of exposure include inhalation, oral, and to a certain extent dermal uptake (tested with volunteer humans and in rat studies).Acrylonitrile Fact Sheet: Support Document (CAS No. 107-13-1). epa.gov Repeated exposure causes skin sensitization and may cause central nervous system and liver damage. There are two main excretion processes of acrylonitrile. The primary method is excretion in urine when acrylonitrile is metabolized by being directly conjugated to glutathione. The other method is when acrylonitrile is metabolized with 2-cyanoethylene oxide to produce cyanide end products that ultimately form thiocyanate, which is excreted via urine, and carbon dioxide and eliminated through the lungs. Metabolites can be detected in the blood and urine.

The \\"pancreine\\" was an extract of bovine pancreas in salted water, after which some impurites were removed with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Paulescu was also, with A. C. Cuza, co-founder of the National Christian Union and later, of the National-Christian Defense League in Romania. Early life and education Nicolae Paulescu in Paris in 1897 Born in Bucharest, he was the first of four children of Costache and Maria Paulescu. He displayed remarkable abilities as early as his first school years. He learned French, Latin and Ancient Greek at an early age, so that a few years later he became fluent in all these languages and was able to read classical works of Latin and Greek literature in the original. He also had a particular gift for drawing and music and special inclinations towards natural sciences, such as physics and chemistry. He graduated from the Mihai Viteazul High School in Bucharest in 1888. In the autumn of 1888, Paulescu left for Paris, where he enrolled in medical school. In 1897 he graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree. Career Upon receiving his M.D., Paulescu was immediately appointed as assistant surgeon at the Notre-Dame du Perp√©tuel- Secours Hospital in Paris. In 1900, Paulescu returned to Romania, where he remained until his death (1931) as Head of the Physiology Department of the University of Bucharest Medical School, as well as a Professor of Clinical Medicine at the St. Vincent de Paul Hospital in Bucharest. Work on insulin In 1916, he succeeded in developing an aqueous pancreatic extract which, when injected into a diabetic dog, proved to have a normalizing effect on blood sugar levels. Shortly after completing the experiments, he was called to service in the Romanian army. After World War I, he resumed his research. From 24 April to 23 June 1921, Paulescu published four papers at the Romanian Section of the Society of Biology in Paris: * The effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a diabetic animal by way of the blood. * The influence of the time elapsed from the intravenous pancreatic injection into a diabetic animal. * The effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a normal animal by way of the blood. An extensive paper on this subject ‚Äì \\"Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation\\" ‚Äì was submitted by Paulescu on 22 June to the Archives Internationales de Physiologie in Li√®ge, Belgium, and was published in the August 1921 issue of this journal. The method used by Paulescu to prepare his pancreatic extract was similar to a procedure described by the American researcher Israel S. Kleiner in an article published in 1919 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Using his procedure, Kleiner had been able to demonstrate significant reductions in the concentration of blood and urinary glucose after intravenous injections of his extract. Paulescu then secured the patent rights for his method of manufacturing pancreine on 10 April 1922 (patent no. 6254) from the Romanian Ministry of Industry and Trade. Nobel Prize controversy In February 1922, doctor Frederick Grant Banting and biochemist John James Rickard Macleod from the University of Toronto, Canada, published their paper on the successful use of a different, alcohol-based pancreatic extract for normalizing blood sugar (glucose) levels (glycemia) in a human patient. An unsuccessful attempt had been made on January 11, 1922, and a successful administration followed on January 25, 1922. The Toronto team felt confident in the purity of their insulin and injected it intravenously into the patient, clearing up his glycosuria and ketonuria and restoring normal blood sugar. Paulescu's 1921 papers mentioned that the extract caused toxic side effects on dogs, which made it unusable in humans (\\"qui la rendent inapplicable dans la pratique m√©dicale\\"). Therefore, when he tested his pancreatic extract on humans on February 25, 1922, he administered the extract rectally. The patients seemed to show some reduction in glycosuria. This apparent success emboldened him to inject his extract intravenously into a diabetic patient on March 24, after which the patient's blood sugar apparently fell to zero (\\".000\\", \\"v√©ritable AGLYC√âMIE\\"). A blood sugar level of zero should have placed the patient into a diabetic coma, but he made no mention of this effect in any of his papers. In contrast, the Toronto team had known for several months that dogs could be placed into a diabetic coma by an overdose of insulin, so they prepared orange juice and candy for the clinical trials. After Banting and Macleod were awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Nicolae Paulescu wrote to the Nobel Prize committee claiming that he had discovered insulin first. However, his claims to priority cannot be sustained. Paulescu prepared pancreatic extract in 1916 and tested it in dogs, but Israel Kleiner tested pancreatic extract in dogs in 1915, as did George Ludwig Zuelzer in 1906. Zuelzer also wrote to the Nobel Prize committee asserting priority. All of these earlier attempts had produced pancreatic extracts that caused side effects in dogs or humans. The Toronto team had noticed the same side effects with their earlier extracts, but they continued working on the problem until they had purified insulin. Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct \\"the historical wrong\\" against Paulescu. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, Scotland, the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the International Diabetes Federation. In an article for a 1971 issue of the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, Murray wrote: > \\"Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulesco, the distinguished > Roumanian scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing > their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone > of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in > diabetic dogs.\\" > \\"In a recent private communication Professor Tiselius, head of the Nobel > Institute, has expressed his personal opinion that Paulesco was equally > worthy of the award in 1923.\\" Antisemitism Paulescu has been criticized for his political activity centered on antisemitic views, which found their expression also in articles such as The Judeo-Masonic plot against the Romanian nation (expressed in his book, Philosophic Physiology: The Hospital, the Koran, the Talmud, the Kahal and FreemasonryNicolae Paulescu.

Nichifor Crainic, the principal ideologist of Orthodoxism, paid homage to Paulescu, by calling him \\"the founder of Christian nationalism\\" and \\"the most complete and most normative eminent doctrinaire of our nationalism.\\" He was an associate of ultranationalist, Professor A. C. Cuza, and wrote extensively for the latter's newspaper ApƒÉrarea Na»õionalƒÉ ('The National Defense'). Paulescu influenced Cuza to incorporate religion into his doctrine. He also heavily influenced the leader of the fascist Iron Guard organisation, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Codreanu extensively quoted Paulescu, and acknowledged the powerful impact that Paulescu's ideas had on his own development.Kevin P. Spicer, Antisemitism, Christian Ambivalence, and the Holocaust, Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 140 Paulescu was the first to link together Romanian antisemitism, Christianity and ultranationalism.Roland Clark, Cornell University Press, 2015, Holy Legionary Youth: Fascist Activism in Interwar Romania, p. 187 In 1922, Paulescu co-founded the \\"National Christian Union\\" (which evolved into the LANC in 1923), together with A. C. Cuza. That same year, the NCU adopted the swastika as its official symbol.Kevin P Spicer Indiana University Press, 2007, Antisemitism, Christian Ambivalence, and the Holocaust, p. 139 In \\"Degenerarea rasei jidƒÉne»ôti\\" (1928) (transl. 'Degeneration of the Jewish Race', using a racist slur), Paulescu states that Jews are degenerate because their brains weigh much less than \\"Arian\\" brains. He singles out for their low brain weight the Nobel Prize laureates Anatole France (non-Jewish), Albert Einstein and Henri Bergson. His starting point was a theory of passions and of social conflicts examined from the angle of a discipline he called \\"philosophical physiology\\". It was illustrated, in the main, by the behavior of Jews, who represented the extreme case of a race ruled by two essential passions: the instincts of domination and ownership. Following protests from several Jewish organizations, the inauguration of Professor Paulescu's bust at the H√¥tel-Dieu State Hospital in Paris, scheduled for 27 August 2003, had to be cancelled. A stamp in honour of Paulescu > \\"If the Nobel Committee in 1923 judged the entire persona of its laureate, > then H√¥tel Dieu in 2003 must do no less and conclude that Paulescu's brutal > inhumanity nullifies any scientific merit\\" (Simon Wiesenthal Center letter > to the French Minister of Health, Jean-Fran√ßois Matt√©i, and the Romanian > Ambassador in Paris). Nicolae Cajal, a Romanian Jewish member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences and the President of the Jewish Communities' Federation of Romania from 1994 to 2004, defended recognition of Paulescu's scientific work, saying there is a need to distinguish between individuals' private views and their scientific merit and that his father, Dr. Marcu Cajal, a student of Paulescu, had admired Paulescu for his scientific skills though he disagreed (as a Jew) with Paulescu's anti-Semitic views.Statement of Nicolae Cajal. ISRO-Press Newsletter Excerpts. Newsletter #287, 31 August 2003. Honours Paulescu died in 1931 in Bucharest. He is buried in Bellu cemetery. In 1990, he was elected posthumously as member of the Romanian Academy. In 1993, the Institute of Diabetes, Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases in Bucharest was named in his honour (Institutul de Diabet, Nutri≈£ie ≈üi Boli Metabolice \\"N. C. Paulescu\\"). The Institute was renamed on 3 March 1993, by the Ministry of Health Decree no. 273, at the initiative of Prof. Dr. Iulian Mincu. On 27 June 1993, in Cluj-Napoca, a postmark was dedicated in Paulescu's honour as part of celebrating the World Day Against Diabetes. Paulescu was also honoured on a postage stamp issued by Romania in 1994. The stamp is one in a set of seven stamps honouring famous Romanians.

From a logical standpoint, A ‚Üí B is by this definition the weakest proposition for which modus ponens, the inference rule A ‚Üí B, A ‚ä¢ B, is sound. Like Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras form a variety axiomatizable with finitely many equations. Heyting algebras were introduced by to formalize intuitionistic logic. As lattices, Heyting algebras are distributive. Every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra when a ‚Üí b is defined as usual as ¬¨a ‚à® b, as is every complete distributive lattice satisfying a one-sided infinite distributive law when a ‚Üí b is taken to be the supremum of the set of all c for which c ‚àß a ‚â§ b. In the finite case, every nonempty distributive lattice, in particular every nonempty finite chain, is automatically complete and completely distributive, and hence a Heyting algebra. It follows from the definition that 1 ‚â§ 0 ‚Üí a, corresponding to the intuition that any proposition a is implied by a contradiction 0. Although the negation operation ¬¨a is not part of the definition, it is definable as a ‚Üí 0. The intuitive content of ¬¨a is the proposition that to assume a would lead to a contradiction. The definition implies that a ‚àß ¬¨a = 0. It can further be shown that a ‚â§ ¬¨¬¨a, although the converse, ¬¨¬¨a ‚â§ a, is not true in general, that is, double negation elimination does not hold in general in a Heyting algebra. Heyting algebras generalize Boolean algebras in the sense that a Heyting algebra satisfying a ‚à® ¬¨a = 1 (excluded middle), equivalently ¬¨¬¨a = a (double negation elimination), is a Boolean algebra. Those elements of a Heyting algebra H of the form ¬¨a comprise a Boolean lattice, but in general this is not a subalgebra of H (see below). Heyting algebras serve as the algebraic models of propositional intuitionistic logic in the same way Boolean algebras model propositional classical logic. The internal logic of an elementary topos is based on the Heyting algebra of subobjects of the terminal object 1 ordered by inclusion, equivalently the morphisms from 1 to the subobject classifier Œ©. The open sets of any topological space form a complete Heyting algebra. Complete Heyting algebras thus become a central object of study in pointless topology. Every Heyting algebra whose set of non-greatest elements has a greatest element (and forms another Heyting algebra) is subdirectly irreducible, whence every Heyting algebra can be made subdirectly irreducible by adjoining a new greatest element. It follows that even among the finite Heyting algebras there exist infinitely many that are subdirectly irreducible, no two of which have the same equational theory. Hence no finite set of finite Heyting algebras can supply all the counterexamples to non-laws of Heyting algebra. This is in sharp contrast to Boolean algebras, whose only subdirectly irreducible one is the two-element one, which on its own therefore suffices for all counterexamples to non-laws of Boolean algebra, the basis for the simple truth table decision method. Nevertheless, it is decidable whether an equation holds of all Heyting algebras.Kripke, S. A.: 1965, ‚ÄòSemantical analysis of intuitionistic logic I‚Äô. In: J. N. Crossley and M. A. E. Dummett (eds.): Formal Systems and Recursive Functions. Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 92‚Äì130. Heyting algebras are less often called pseudo-Boolean algebras, or even Brouwer lattices, although the latter term may denote the dual definition, or have a slightly more general meaning.  Formal definition  A Heyting algebra H is a bounded lattice such that for all a and b in H there is a greatest element x of H such that : a \\\\wedge x \\\\le b. This element is the relative pseudo-complement of a with respect to b, and is denoted a‚Üíb. We write 1 and 0 for the largest and the smallest element of H, respectively. In any Heyting algebra, one defines the pseudo-complement ¬¨a of any element a by setting ¬¨a = (a‚Üí0). By definition, a\\\\wedge \\\\lnot a = 0, and ¬¨a is the largest element having this property. However, it is not in general true that a\\\\vee\\\\lnot a=1, thus ¬¨ is only a pseudo-complement, not a true complement, as would be the case in a Boolean algebra. A complete Heyting algebra is a Heyting algebra that is a complete lattice. A subalgebra of a Heyting algebra H is a subset H1 of H containing 0 and 1 and closed under the operations ‚àß, ‚à® and ‚Üí. It follows that it is also closed under ¬¨. A subalgebra is made into a Heyting algebra by the induced operations. Alternative definitions Category-theoretic definition A Heyting algebra H is a bounded lattice that has all exponential objects. The lattice H is regarded as a category where meet, \\\\wedge, is the product. The exponential condition means that for any objects Y and Z in H an exponential Z^Y uniquely exists as an object in H. A Heyting implication (often written using \\\\Rightarrow or \\\\multimap to avoid confusions such as the use of \\\\to to indicate a functor) is just an exponential: Y \\\\Rightarrow Z is an alternative notation for Z^Y. From the definition of exponentials we have that implication (\\\\Rightarrow : H \\\\times H \\\\to H) is right adjoint to meet (\\\\wedge : H \\\\times H \\\\to H). This adjunction can be written as (- \\\\wedge Y) \\\\dashv (Y \\\\Rightarrow -) or more fully as: (- \\\\wedge Y): H \\\\stackrel {\\\\longrightarrow} {\\\\underset {\\\\longleftarrow}{\\\\top}} H: (Y \\\\Rightarrow -) Lattice-theoretic definitions An equivalent definition of Heyting algebras can be given by considering the mappings: :\\\\begin{cases} f_a \\\\colon H \\\\to H \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_a(x)=a\\\\wedge x \\\\end{cases} for some fixed a in H. A bounded lattice H is a Heyting algebra if and only if every mapping fa is the lower adjoint of a monotone Galois connection. In this case the respective upper adjoint ga is given by ga(x) = a‚Üíx, where ‚Üí is defined as above. Yet another definition is as a residuated lattice whose monoid operation is ‚àß. The monoid unit must then be the top element 1. Commutativity of this monoid implies that the two residuals coincide as a‚Üíb. Bounded lattice with an implication operation Given a bounded lattice A with largest and smallest elements 1 and 0, and a binary operation ‚Üí, these together form a Heyting algebra if and only if the following hold: #a\\\\to a = 1 #a\\\\wedge(a\\\\to b)=a\\\\wedge b #b\\\\wedge(a\\\\to b)= b #a\\\\to (b\\\\wedge c)= (a\\\\to b)\\\\wedge (a\\\\to c) where 4 is the distributive law for ‚Üí. Characterization using the axioms of intuitionistic logic This characterization of Heyting algebras makes the proof of the basic facts concerning the relationship between intuitionist propositional calculus and Heyting algebras immediate. (For these facts, see the sections \\"Provable identities\\" and \\"Universal constructions\\".) One should think of the element \\\\top as meaning, intuitively, \\"provably true.\\" Compare with the axioms at Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization ). Given a set A with three binary operations ‚Üí, ‚àß and ‚à®, and two distinguished elements \\\\bot and \\\\top, then A is a Heyting algebra for these operations (and the relation ‚â§ defined by the condition that a \\\\le b when a‚Üíb = \\\\top) if and only if the following conditions hold for any elements x, y and z of A: #\\\\mbox{If } x \\\\le y \\\\mbox{ and } y \\\\le x \\\\mbox{ then } x = y , #\\\\mbox{If } \\\\top \\\\le y , \\\\mbox{ then } y = \\\\top , #x \\\\le y \\\\to x , # x \\\\to (y \\\\to z) \\\\le (x \\\\to y) \\\\to (x \\\\to z) , # x \\\\land y \\\\le x , # x \\\\land y \\\\le y , # x \\\\le y \\\\to (x \\\\land y) , # x \\\\le x \\\\lor y , # y \\\\le x \\\\lor y , # x \\\\to z \\\\le (y \\\\to z) \\\\to (x \\\\lor y \\\\to z) , # \\\\bot \\\\le x . Finally, we define ¬¨x to be x‚Üí \\\\bot. Condition 1 says that equivalent formulas should be identified. Condition 2 says that provably true formulas are closed under modus ponens. Conditions 3 and 4 are then conditions. Conditions 5, 6 and 7 are and conditions. Conditions 8, 9 and 10 are or conditions. Condition 11 is a false condition. Of course, if a different set of axioms were chosen for logic, we could modify ours accordingly.  Examples  free Heyting algebra over one generator (aka Rieger‚ÄìNishimura lattice) * Every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra, with p‚Üíq given by ¬¨p‚à®q. * Every totally ordered set that has a least element 0 and a greatest element 1 is a Heyting algebra (if viewed as a lattice). In this case p‚Üíq equals to 1 when p‚â§q, and q otherwise. * The simplest Heyting algebra that is not already a Boolean algebra is the totally ordered set {0, ¬Ω, 1} (viewed as a lattice), yielding the operations: { -style=\\"vertical-align:bottom\\"  {  + a \\\\land b - !  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  0  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  0 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  1 }  width=\\"30\\"   {  + a \\\\lor b - !  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  0  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  1 }  width=\\"30\\"   {  + - !  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  0  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  bgcolor=\\"white\\" width=\\"30\\" align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  1 }  width=\\"30\\"   {   width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"  a  width=\\"50\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬¨a -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  0  align=\\"center\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  ¬Ω  align=\\"center\\"  0 -  bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"center\\"  1  align=\\"center\\"  0 } } In this example, that falsifies the law of excluded middle. * Every topology provides a complete Heyting algebra in the form of its open set lattice. In this case, the element A‚ÜíB is the interior of the union of Ac and B, where Ac denotes the complement of the open set A. Not all complete Heyting algebras are of this form. These issues are studied in pointless topology, where complete Heyting algebras are also called frames or locales. * Every interior algebra provides a Heyting algebra in the form of its lattice of open elements. Every Heyting algebra is of this form as a Heyting algebra can be completed to a Boolean algebra by taking its free Boolean extension as a bounded distributive lattice and then treating it as a generalized topology in this Boolean algebra. * The Lindenbaum algebra of propositional intuitionistic logic is a Heyting algebra. * The global elements of the subobject classifier Œ© of an elementary topos form a Heyting algebra; it is the Heyting algebra of truth values of the intuitionistic higher-order logic induced by the topos. * ≈Åukasiewicz‚ÄìMoisil algebras (LMn) are also Heyting algebras for any n, Theorem 3.6 (but they are not MV-algebras for n ‚â• 5Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MVn-algebras and n-valued ≈Åukasiewicz‚ÄìMoisil algebras‚ÄîI. Discrete Math. 181, 155‚Äì177 (1998) ).  Properties  General properties The ordering \\\\le on a Heyting algebra H can be recovered from the operation ‚Üí as follows: for any elements a, b of H, a \\\\le b if and only if a‚Üíb = 1. In contrast to some many-valued logics, Heyting algebras share the following property with Boolean algebras: if negation has a fixed point (i.e. ¬¨a = a for some a), then the Heyting algebra is the trivial one-element Heyting algebra. Provable identities Given a formula F(A_1, A_2,\\\\ldots, A_n) of propositional calculus (using, in addition to the variables, the connectives \\\\land, \\\\lor, \\\\lnot, \\\\to, and the constants 0 and 1), it is a fact, proved early on in any study of Heyting algebras, that the following two conditions are equivalent: # The formula F is provably true in intuitionist propositional calculus. # The identity F(a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n) = 1 is true for any Heyting algebra H and any elements a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n \\\\in H. The metaimplication is extremely useful and is the principal practical method for proving identities in Heyting algebras. In practice, one frequently uses the deduction theorem in such proofs. Since for any a and b in a Heyting algebra H we have a \\\\le b if and only if a‚Üíb = 1, it follows from that whenever a formula F‚ÜíG is provably true, we have F(a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n) \\\\le G(a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n) for any Heyting algebra H, and any elements a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n \\\\in H. (It follows from the deduction theorem that F‚ÜíG is provable [from nothing] if and only if G is provable from F, that is, if G is a provable consequence of F.) In particular, if F and G are provably equivalent, then F(a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n) = G(a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n), since ‚â§ is an order relation. 1 ‚áí 2 can be proved by examining the logical axioms of the system of proof and verifying that their value is 1 in any Heyting algebra, and then verifying that the application of the rules of inference to expressions with value 1 in a Heyting algebra results in expressions with value 1. For example, let us choose the system of proof having modus ponens as its sole rule of inference, and whose axioms are the Hilbert-style ones given at Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization. Then the facts to be verified follow immediately from the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras given above. 1 ‚áí 2 also provides a method for proving that certain propositional formulas, though tautologies in classical logic, cannot be proved in intuitionist propositional logic. In order to prove that some formula F(A_1, A_2,\\\\ldots, A_n) is not provable, it is enough to exhibit a Heyting algebra H and elements a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n \\\\in H such that F(a_1, a_2,\\\\ldots, a_n) e 1. If one wishes to avoid mention of logic, then in practice it becomes necessary to prove as a lemma a version of the deduction theorem valid for Heyting algebras: for any elements a, b and c of a Heyting algebra H, we have (a \\\\land b) \\\\to c = a \\\\to (b \\\\to c). For more on the metaimplication 2 ‚áí 1, see the section \\"Universal constructions\\" below. Distributivity Heyting algebras are always distributive. Specifically, we always have the identities #a \\\\wedge (b \\\\vee c) = (a \\\\wedge b) \\\\vee (a \\\\wedge c) #a \\\\vee (b \\\\wedge c) = (a \\\\vee b) \\\\wedge (a \\\\vee c) The distributive law is sometimes stated as an axiom, but in fact it follows from the existence of relative pseudo-complements. The reason is that, being the lower adjoint of a Galois connection, \\\\wedge preserves all existing suprema. Distributivity in turn is just the preservation of binary suprema by \\\\wedge. By a similar argument, the following infinite distributive law holds in any complete Heyting algebra: :x\\\\wedge\\\\bigvee Y = \\\\bigvee \\\\\\\\{x\\\\wedge y \\\\mid y \\\\in Y\\\\\\\\} for any element x in H and any subset Y of H. Conversely, any complete lattice satisfying the above infinite distributive law is a complete Heyting algebra, with :a\\\\to b=\\\\bigvee\\\\\\\\{c\\\\mid a\\\\land c\\\\le b\\\\\\\\} being its relative pseudo- complement operation. Regular and complemented elements An element x of a Heyting algebra H is called regular if either of the following equivalent conditions hold: #x = ¬¨¬¨x. #x = ¬¨y for some y in H. The equivalence of these conditions can be restated simply as the identity ¬¨¬¨¬¨x = ¬¨x, valid for all x in H. Elements x and y of a Heyting algebra H are called complements to each other if x‚àßy = 0 and x‚à®y = 1. If it exists, any such y is unique and must in fact be equal to ¬¨x. We call an element x complemented if it admits a complement. It is true that if x is complemented, then so is ¬¨x, and then x and ¬¨x are complements to each other. However, confusingly, even if x is not complemented, ¬¨x may nonetheless have a complement (not equal to x). In any Heyting algebra, the elements 0 and 1 are complements to each other. For instance, it is possible that ¬¨x is 0 for every x different from 0, and 1 if x = 0, in which case 0 and 1 are the only regular elements. Any complemented element of a Heyting algebra is regular, though the converse is not true in general. In particular, 0 and 1 are always regular. For any Heyting algebra H, the following conditions are equivalent: # H is a Boolean algebra; # every x in H is regular;Rutherford (1965), Th.26.2 p.78. # every x in H is complemented.Rutherford (1965), Th.26.1 p.78. In this case, the element is equal to The regular (resp. complemented) elements of any Heyting algebra H constitute a Boolean algebra Hreg (resp. Hcomp), in which the operations ‚àß, ¬¨ and ‚Üí, as well as the constants 0 and 1, coincide with those of H. In the case of Hcomp, the operation ‚à® is also the same, hence Hcomp is a subalgebra of H. In general however, Hreg will not be a subalgebra of H, because its join operation ‚à®reg may be differ from ‚à®. For we have See below for necessary and sufficient conditions in order for ‚à®reg to coincide with ‚à®. The De Morgan laws in a Heyting algebra One of the two De Morgan laws is satisfied in every Heyting algebra, namely :\\\\forall x,y \\\\in H: \\\\qquad \\\\lnot(x \\\\vee y)=\\\\lnot x \\\\wedge \\\\lnot y. However, the other De Morgan law does not always hold. We have instead a weak de Morgan law: :\\\\forall x,y \\\\in H: \\\\qquad \\\\lnot(x \\\\wedge y)= \\\\lnot \\\\lnot (\\\\lnot x \\\\vee \\\\lnot y). The following statements are equivalent for all Heyting algebras H: #H satisfies both De Morgan laws, #\\\\lnot(x \\\\wedge y)=\\\\lnot x \\\\vee \\\\lnot y \\\\mbox{ for all } x, y \\\\in H, #\\\\lnot(x \\\\wedge y)=\\\\lnot x \\\\vee \\\\lnot y \\\\mbox{ for all regular } x, y \\\\in H, #\\\\lnot\\\\lnot (x \\\\vee y) = \\\\lnot\\\\lnot x \\\\vee \\\\lnot\\\\lnot y \\\\mbox{ for all } x, y \\\\in H, #\\\\lnot\\\\lnot (x \\\\vee y) = x \\\\vee y \\\\mbox{ for all regular } x, y \\\\in H, #\\\\lnot(\\\\lnot x \\\\wedge \\\\lnot y) = x \\\\vee y \\\\mbox{ for all regular } x, y \\\\in H, #\\\\lnot x \\\\vee \\\\lnot\\\\lnot x = 1 \\\\mbox{ for all } x \\\\in H. Condition 2 is the other De Morgan law. Condition 6 says that the join operation ‚à®reg on the Boolean algebra Hreg of regular elements of H coincides with the operation ‚à® of H. Condition 7 states that every regular element is complemented, i.e., Hreg = Hcomp. We prove the equivalence. Clearly the metaimplications and are trivial. Furthermore, and result simply from the first De Morgan law and the definition of regular elements. We show that by taking ¬¨x and ¬¨¬¨x in place of x and y in 6 and using the identity Notice that follows from the first De Morgan law, and results from the fact that the join operation ‚à® on the subalgebra Hcomp is just the restriction of ‚à® to Hcomp, taking into account the characterizations we have given of conditions 6 and 7. The metaimplication is a trivial consequence of the weak De Morgan law, taking ¬¨x and ¬¨y in place of x and y in 5. Heyting algebras satisfying the above properties are related to De Morgan logic in the same way Heyting algebras in general are related to intuitionist logic. Heyting algebra morphisms Definition Given two Heyting algebras H1 and H2 and a mapping we say that ∆í is a morphism of Heyting algebras if, for any elements x and y in H1, we have: #f(0) = 0, #f(x \\\\land y) = f(x) \\\\land f(y), #f(x \\\\lor y) = f(x) \\\\lor f(y), #f(x \\\\to y) = f(x) \\\\to f(y), It follows from any of the last three conditions (2, 3, or 4) that f is an increasing function, that is, that whenever . Assume H1 and H2 are structures with operations ‚Üí, ‚àß, ‚à® (and possibly ¬¨) and constants 0 and 1, and f is a surjective mapping from H1 to H2 with properties 1 through 4 above. Then if H1 is a Heyting algebra, so too is H2. This follows from the characterization of Heyting algebras as bounded lattices (thought of as algebraic structures rather than partially ordered sets) with an operation ‚Üí satisfying certain identities. Properties The identity map from any Heyting algebra to itself is a morphism, and the composite of any two morphisms f and g is a morphism. Hence Heyting algebras form a category. Examples Given a Heyting algebra H and any subalgebra H1, the inclusion mapping is a morphism. For any Heyting algebra H, the map defines a morphism from H onto the Boolean algebra of its regular elements Hreg. This is not in general a morphism from H to itself, since the join operation of Hreg may be different from that of H. Quotients Let H be a Heyting algebra, and let We call F a filter on H if it satisfies the following properties: #1 \\\\in F, # \\\\mbox{If } x,y \\\\in F \\\\mbox{ then } x \\\\land y \\\\in F, # \\\\mbox{If } x \\\\in F, \\\\ y \\\\in H, \\\\ \\\\mbox{and } x \\\\le y \\\\mbox{ then } y \\\\in F. The intersection of any set of filters on H is again a filter. Therefore, given any subset S of H there is a smallest filter containing S. We call it the filter generated by S. If S is empty, Otherwise, F is equal to the set of x in H such that there exist with If H is a Heyting algebra and F is a filter on H, we define a relation ‚àº on H as follows: we write whenever and both belong to F. Then ‚àº is an equivalence relation; we write for the quotient set. There is a unique Heyting algebra structure on such that the canonical surjection becomes a Heyting algebra morphism. We call the Heyting algebra the quotient of H by F. Let S be a subset of a Heyting algebra H and let F be the filter generated by S. Then H/F satisfies the following universal property: :Given any morphism of Heyting algebras satisfying for every f factors uniquely through the canonical surjection That is, there is a unique morphism satisfying The morphism f‚Ä≤ is said to be induced by f. Let be a morphism of Heyting algebras. The kernel of f, written ker f, is the set It is a filter on H1. (Care should be taken because this definition, if applied to a morphism of Boolean algebras, is dual to what would be called the kernel of the morphism viewed as a morphism of rings.) By the foregoing, f induces a morphism It is an isomorphism of onto the subalgebra f[H1] of H2. Universal constructions Heyting algebra of propositional formulas in n variables up to intuitionist equivalence The metaimplication in the section \\"Provable identities\\" is proved by showing that the result of the following construction is itself a Heyting algebra: #Consider the set L of propositional formulas in the variables A1, A2,..., An. # Endow L with a preorder ‚âº by defining F‚âºG if G is an (intuitionist) logical consequence of F, that is, if G is provable from F. It is immediate that ‚âº is a preorder. # Consider the equivalence relation F‚àºG induced by the preorder F‚âºG. (It is defined by F‚àºG if and only if F‚âºG and G‚âºF. In fact, ‚àº is the relation of (intuitionist) logical equivalence.) # Let H0 be the quotient set L/‚àº. This will be the desired Heyting algebra. # We write [F] for the equivalence class of a formula F. Operations ‚Üí, ‚àß, ‚à® and ¬¨ are defined in an obvious way on L. Verify that given formulas F and G, the equivalence classes [F‚ÜíG], [F‚àßG], [F‚à®G] and [¬¨F] depend only on [F] and [G]. This defines operations ‚Üí, ‚àß, ‚à® and ¬¨ on the quotient set H0=L/‚àº. Further define 1 to be the class of provably true statements, and set 0=[‚ä•]. # Verify that H0, together with these operations, is a Heyting algebra. We do this using the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras. H0 satisfies conditions THEN-1 through FALSE because all formulas of the given forms are axioms of intuitionist logic. MODUS-PONENS follows from the fact that if a formula ‚ä§‚ÜíF is provably true, where ‚ä§ is provably true, then F is provably true (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens). Finally, EQUIV results from the fact that if F‚ÜíG and G‚ÜíF are both provably true, then F and G are provable from each other (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens), hence [F]=[G]. As always under the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras, we define ‚â§ on H0 by the condition that x‚â§y if and only if x‚Üíy=1. Since, by the deduction theorem, a formula F‚ÜíG is provably true if and only if G is provable from F, it follows that [F]‚â§[G] if and only if F‚âºG. In other words, ‚â§ is the order relation on L/‚àº induced by the preorder ‚âº on L. Free Heyting algebra on an arbitrary set of generators In fact, the preceding construction can be carried out for any set of variables {Ai : i‚ààI} (possibly infinite). One obtains in this way the free Heyting algebra on the variables {Ai}, which we will again denote by H0. It is free in the sense that given any Heyting algebra H given together with a family of its elements „Äàai: i‚ààI „Äâ, there is a unique morphism f:H0‚ÜíH satisfying f([Ai])=ai. The uniqueness of f is not difficult to see, and its existence results essentially from the metaimplication of the section \\"Provable identities\\" above, in the form of its corollary that whenever F and G are provably equivalent formulas, F(„Äàai„Äâ)=G(„Äàai„Äâ) for any family of elements „Äàai„Äâin H. Heyting algebra of formulas equivalent with respect to a theory T Given a set of formulas T in the variables {Ai}, viewed as axioms, the same construction could have been carried out with respect to a relation F‚âºG defined on L to mean that G is a provable consequence of F and the set of axioms T. Let us denote by HT the Heyting algebra so obtained. Then HT satisfies the same universal property as H0 above, but with respect to Heyting algebras H and families of elements „Äàai„Äâ satisfying the property that J(„Äàai„Äâ)=1 for any axiom J(„ÄàAi„Äâ) in T. (Let us note that HT, taken with the family of its elements „Äà[Ai]„Äâ, itself satisfies this property.) The existence and uniqueness of the morphism is proved the same way as for H0, except that one must modify the metaimplication in \\"Provable identities\\" so that 1 reads \\"provably true from T,\\" and 2 reads \\"any elements a1, a2,..., an in H satisfying the formulas of T.\\" The Heyting algebra HT that we have just defined can be viewed as a quotient of the free Heyting algebra H0 on the same set of variables, by applying the universal property of H0 with respect to HT, and the family of its elements „Äà[Ai]„Äâ. Every Heyting algebra is isomorphic to one of the form HT. To see this, let H be any Heyting algebra, and let „Äàai: i‚ààI„Äâ be a family of elements generating H (for example, any surjective family). Now consider the set T of formulas J(„ÄàAi„Äâ) in the variables „ÄàAi: i‚ààI„Äâ such that J(„Äàai„Äâ)=1. Then we obtain a morphism f:HT‚ÜíH by the universal property of HT, which is clearly surjective. It is not difficult to show that f is injective. Comparison to Lindenbaum algebras The constructions we have just given play an entirely analogous role with respect to Heyting algebras to that of Lindenbaum algebras with respect to Boolean algebras. In fact, The Lindenbaum algebra BT in the variables {Ai} with respect to the axioms T is just our HT‚à™T1, where T1 is the set of all formulas of the form ¬¨¬¨F‚ÜíF, since the additional axioms of T1 are the only ones that need to be added in order to make all classical tautologies provable. Heyting algebras as applied to intuitionistic logic If one interprets the axioms of the intuitionistic propositional logic as terms of a Heyting algebra, then they will evaluate to the largest element, 1, in any Heyting algebra under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. For instance, (P‚àßQ)‚ÜíP is, by definition of the pseudo-complement, the largest element x such that P \\\\land Q \\\\land x \\\\le P. This inequation is satisfied for any x, so the largest such x is 1. Furthermore, the rule of modus ponens allows us to derive the formula Q from the formulas P and P‚ÜíQ. But in any Heyting algebra, if P has the value 1, and P‚ÜíQ has the value 1, then it means that P \\\\land 1 \\\\le Q, and so 1 \\\\land 1 \\\\le Q; it can only be that Q has the value 1. This means that if a formula is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms by way of the rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,¬Ω,1} as given above. If we assign ¬Ω to P and 0 to Q, then the value of Peirce's law ((P‚ÜíQ)‚ÜíP)‚ÜíP is ¬Ω. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See Curry-Howard isomorphism for the general context of what this implies in type theory. The converse can be proven as well: if a formula always has the value 1, then it is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, so the intuitionistically valid formulas are exactly those that always have a value of 1. This is similar to the notion that classically valid formulas are those formulas that have a value of 1 in the two-element Boolean algebra under any possible assignment of true and false to the formula's variables -- that is, they are formulas which are tautologies in the usual truth-table sense. A Heyting algebra, from the logical standpoint, is then a generalization of the usual system of truth values, and its largest element 1 is analogous to 'true'. The usual two-valued logic system is a special case of a Heyting algebra, and the smallest non-trivial one, in which the only elements of the algebra are 1 (true) and 0 (false). Decision problems The problem of whether a given equation holds in every Heyting algebra was shown to be decidable by S. Kripke in 1965. The precise computational complexity of the problem was established by R. Statman in 1979, who showed it was PSPACE-complete and hence at least as hard as deciding equations of Boolean algebra (shown coNP-complete in 1971 by S. Cook) and conjectured to be considerably harder. The elementary or first- order theory of Heyting algebras is undecidable. It remains open whether the universal Horn theory of Heyting algebras, or word problem, is decidable.Peter T. Johnstone, Stone Spaces, (1982) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, . (See paragraph 4.11) √Ä propos of the word problem it is known that Heyting algebras are not locally finite (no Heyting algebra generated by a finite nonempty set is finite), in contrast to Boolean algebras which are locally finite and whose word problem is decidable. It is unknown whether free complete Heyting algebras exist except in the case of a single generator where the free Heyting algebra on one generator is trivially completable by adjoining a new top.

Many Plain people have an Anabaptist background. These denominations are largely of German, Swiss German, Dutch or other European ancestry. Conservative Friends are traditional Quakers who are also considered plain people; they come from a variety of different ethnic backgrounds. Origins Anabaptists The Mennonite movement was a reform movement of Anabaptist origins begun by Swiss Brethren and soon thereafter finding greater cohesion based on the teachings of Menno Simons 1496‚Äì1561, and the 1632 Dordrecht Confession of Faith. The Amish movement was a reform movement within the Mennonite movement, based on the teachings of Jacob Ammann, who perceived a lack of discipline within the Mennonite movement by those trying to avoid persecution. Ammann argued that prohibited that. Quakers William Penn, having experienced religious persecution as a Quaker, offered asylum to others who were suffering religious persecution, an offer that many followers of Jacob Ammann accepted, starting with the Detweiler and Sieber families, who settled in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in 1736. Many of them settled near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which offered some of the most productive non-irrigated farmland in the world. By 1770, the Amish migration had largely ceased. Plain dress Notable Plain groups in the Anabaptist tradition are Old Order Amish, New Order Amish, Kauffman Amish Mennonites, Beachy Amish Mennonites, Para-Amish (Believers in Christ, Vernon Community, Caneyville Christian Community), Old Order Mennonites, Conservative Mennonites, Conservative Mennonite Conference, Reformed Mennonites, Orthodox Mennonites, Old Colony Mennonites, Holdeman Mennonites, Hutterites, Bruderhof, Old German Baptist Brethren, Old Brethren and Old Order River Brethren. The Cooperites (Gloriavale Christian Community) also wear plain dress. A small number of Quakers still practice plain dress as a part of their testimony of simplicity. The Shakers also dressed plain, but today there are almost no Shakers left. Many Apostolic Lutherans also wear plain dress. Historically, members of the Moravian Church wore plain dress. Early Methodists wore plain dress, with clergy condemning \\"high headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and 'costly apparel' in general\\". In his sermon On Dress, John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, expressed his desire for Methodists to wear plain clothing in the manner practiced by Quakers: \\"Let me see, before I die, a Methodist congregation, full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation.\\" Peter Cartwright, a Methodist revivalist, noted the gradual decline of wearing plain dress among Methodists; today, members of denominations in the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, continue to dress plainly, sometimes including abstention of wearing of jewelry, such as wedding rings. Traditional Adventists and Mormon Fundamentalists also wear plain dress. Plain customs Customs of Plain people include: * Plain clothes, usually in solid, normally dark colors. * Plain church buildings, or no church buildings whatsoever. * A utilitarian view of technology, similar to the precautionary principle of technology in that unknowns should be avoided, but the emphasis was on the results in the eyes of God. If they were unsure of how God would look upon a technology, the leaders of the church would determine whether it was to be avoided or not. The degree to which this principle was supported varied among the congregations, but in general, the Amish people believed that the Mennonites had not done enough to separate themselves from the rest of the world. Religious practices Anabaptist Plain groups typically have a bishop presiding over one congregation (Amish) or over a district (group of congregations) (Old Order Mennonites). Mennonites mostly meet in church buildings, but most Amish meet in members' homes. Services among Amish and Plain Mennonites are mostly held in Pennsylvania German, a language closely related to Palatinate German, with extra vocabulary. Bishops are commonly chosen by lot as a reflection of God's will. While the Bishop tends to be influential, he tends to rule by building consensus rather than by issuing edicts. Most Anabaptist Plain groups have an Ordnung that among other things regulates clothing. The Ordnung is a largely unwritten code of behavior, covering such items as clothing, vehicles, and the use of technology. The Ordnung varies slightly from congregation to congregation, though is in essence the same. Violations are not considered sins, although pride, selfishness and wilfulness are considered to be a serious violation of the faith. The congregation can change the Ordnung if there is a majority who desire to do so. Exemptions to the Ordnung can be provided. In one instance, one farmer was granted permission to buy a modern tractor since he had arthritis and no children to help him harness horses. In other very hot, dry areas such as the Southwest, some provision has been made for mechanical plowing and harvesting, in areas where horses may not be able to work hard in the field all day long. Trends Amish young women at the beach, Chincoteague, Virginia. The Old Order Amish are among the fastest-growing populations in the world. They have low infant mortality rates. The average Amish woman can expect to have at least seven live births. Other Plain sects with the same or similar doctrines can be expected to have similarly explosive growth. Despite this, the Pennsylvania Dutch, which includes Amish, Old Order Mennonite, and Conservative Mennonites are expected by some to become a smaller percentage of the population as the sects respond to high prices of farmland by spreading out all over the United States and internationally, and the \\"English\\" (the Amish exonym for non-Amish persons regardless of ancestry) population spreads out from Philadelphia into suburban and rural areas. Many Amish and plain Mennonites of the last 30 years have moved into non-farm work, such as construction, woodworking, harness making, shopkeeping, auctioneer services and other crafts. Donald Kraybill believes there are Plain church communities in 47 states. Among people at least five years old living in Lancaster County in 2000, *89% spoke English at home; *7% spoke Pennsylvania Dutch; *4% spoke Spanish. Most but not all Anabaptist Plain churches do not admit children to their church membership, requiring baptism first during the teen years, and so they impose no sanctions on those who do not join, but shun those who fall away from the church once becoming a member. Among some groups of Old Order Amish, teenagers who are not yet baptized are not bound by the rules and go through a period of rumspringa, often with a certain amount of misbehavior that would not otherwise be tolerated. Health The Amish generally do not proselytize and discourage intermarriage with outsiders, unless they have joined the Amish. Because of their historic tendency to move less in their lifetime, a high birthrate, high number of double cousins as compared with the general public and lower number of possible marriage partners, this has historically resulted in marriages of 3rd, 4th, 5th and other cousins who share ancestors. Similar to European royalty, this close degree of consanguinity has led to certain genetic problems occurring more frequently among the Amish. Dr. D. Holmes Morton has established the Clinic for Special Children to study and treat families with these problems.Kate Ruder, Genomics in Amish Country Genome News Network, July 23, 2004 Many of the Plain churches prohibit insurance, and instead they follow a system of Mutual Aid to assist each other charitably in case of sickness, accident, death or property damage. Internal Revenue Service Form 4029 allows one to claim exemption to Social Security taxes under certain restrictive conditions, and members of the Plain groups who do not pay these taxes also do not receive death, disability, or retirement benefits from social security.

Lale Andersen (23 March 1905 ‚Äì 29 August 1972) was a German chanson singer- songwriter and actress born in Lehe (now part of Bremerhaven). She is best known for her interpretation of the song Lili Marleen in 1939, which by 1941 transcended the conflict to become World War II's biggest international hit. Popular with both the Axis and the Allies, Andersen's original recording spawned versions, by the end of the War, in most of the major languages of Europe, and by some of the most popular artists in their respective countries. Biography Early life Andersen was born in Lehe and baptized Elisabeth Carlotta Helena Berta Bunnenberg,Lehrke, G.: Wie einst Lili Marleen‚ÄîDas Leben der Lale Andersen, Henschel Verlag, 2002; . In German. but known informally as ‚ÄòLiese-Lotte‚Äô‚Äîa diminutive of her first two names‚Äîto friends and family; this continued after her first marriage when she was known as ‚ÄòLiselotte Wilke‚Äô. In 1922, aged 17, she married German Impressionist painter (1894‚Äì1971). They had three children: Bj√∂rn, Carmen-Litta, and (1929‚Äì2017) the youngest of whom also enjoyed a career in the German music industry. Shortly after the birth of their last child, the marriage broke up. Leaving the children in the care of her siblings Thekla and Helmut, Andersen went to Berlin in October 1929, where she reportedly studied acting at the Schauspielschule at the Deutsches Theater. In 1931, her marriage ended in divorce. Around this time, she began appearing on stage in various cabarets in Berlin. From 1933 to 1937, she performed at the Schauspielhaus in Z√ºrich, where she also met Rolf Liebermann, who would remain a close friend for the rest of her life. In 1938, she was in Munich at the cabaret Simpl, and soon afterwards joined the prestigious Kabarett der Komiker (Comedians' Cabaret) in Berlin. \\"Lili Marleen\\" and the war years While at the Kabarett der Komiker, she met Norbert Schultze, who had composed the music for \\"Lili Marleen\\". Andersen recorded the song in 1939, but it would only become a hit when the Soldatensender Belgrad (Belgrade Soldier's Radio), the radio station of the German armed forces in occupied Yugoslavia, began broadcasting it in 1941. \\"Lili Marleen\\" quickly became immensely popular with German soldiers at the front. The transmitter of the radio station at Belgrade, was powerful enough to be received all over Europe and the Mediterranean, and the song soon became popular with the Allied troops as well. Andersen was awarded a gold disc for over one million sales of \\"Lili Marleen\\" [His Masters Voice ‚Äì EG 6993]. It is thought that she was awarded her copy after the end of World War II. A copy of this particular gold disc owned by the \\"His Masters Voice\\" record company was discarded during the renovation of their flagship store on Oxford Street, London, during the 1960s where, hitherto, it had been on display. However, the disc was recovered and is now in a private collection. Nazi officials did not approve of the song and Joseph Goebbels prohibited it from being played on the radio. Andersen was not allowed to perform in public for nine months, not just because of the song but because of her friendship with Rolf Liebermann and other Jewish artists she had met in Zurich. In desperation, she reportedly attempted suicide. Andersen was so popular, however, that the Nazi government allowed her to perform again, albeit subject to several conditions, one of which was she would not sing \\"Lili Marleen\\". Goebbels did order her to make a new \\"military\\" version of the song (with a significant drum) which was recorded in June 1942. In the remaining war years, Andersen had one minor appearance in a propaganda movie and was made to sing several propaganda songs in English. Shortly before the end of the war, Andersen retired to Langeoog, a small island off the North Sea coast of Germany. Career after World War II After the war, Andersen all but disappeared as a singer. In 1949, she married Swiss composer Artur Beul. In 1952 she made a comeback with the song \\"Die blaue Nacht am Hafen\\", which she had written the lyrics for herself. In 1959, she had another hit \\"Ein Schiff wird kommen...\\", a cover version of \\"Never on Sunday\\", the title song from the movie of the same name, originally sung in Greek by Melina Mercouri. Each song won her a gold album in Germany. In 1961, she participated as the representative of Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Einmal sehen wir uns wieder\\", which only reached 13th place with three points. Fifty- six years old at the time, for over 45 years, she held the record of the eldest participant at Eurovision ‚Äì surpassed only in 2008 by the 75-year-old Croatian entertainer 75 Cents. Throughout the 1960s, she toured Europe, the United States and Canada, until her farewell tour Goodbye memories in 1967. Two years later, she published a book Wie werde ich Haifisch? ‚Äì Ein heiterer Ratgeber f√ºr alle, die Schlager singen, texten oder komponieren wollen (How do I become a shark? ‚Äì A cheerful companion for all who want to sing hit songs, write lyrics, or compose music), and in 1972, shortly before her death, her autobiography Der Himmel hat viele Farben (The Sky Has Many Colours) appeared and topped the bestselling list of the German magazine Der Spiegel. Death Lale Andersen died of liver cancer in Vienna, aged 67, and was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering. Her ashes are buried in D√ºnenfriedhof (i.e. Sand Dunes Cemetery), on Langeoog Island. Footnotes *Note a: Lale Andersen often wrote her own lyrics, usually under the pseudonym Nicola Wilke. *Note b: Lehe at the time of her birth was an independent municipality. It is now part of Bremerhaven. In 1924 Lehe was amalgamated with the neighbouring Geestem√ºnde to become the city of Weserm√ºnde. Bremerhaven, which was founded in 1827, was merged into Weserm√ºnde in 1939. In 1947, Weserm√ºnde became part of the state of Bremen and was renamed as Bremerhaven. *Note c: Although some online resources give 1924 as the year of the marriage, Lehrke's book contains a copy of the wedding announcement that had appeared in the Nordwestdeutsche Zeitung on 1 April 1922. *Note d: In her early career, Lale Andersen was sometimes billed as Liselotte Wilke.

Typical climbing shoes have a close fit, little if any padding, and a smooth, sticky rubber sole with an extended rubber . Unsuited to walking and hiking, climbing shoes are typically donned at the base of a climb.  Construction  Modern climbing shoes use carefully crafted multi-piece patterns to conform very closely to the wearer's feet. Leather is the most common upper material, with other materials such as fabric and synthetic leather also employed. The climbing rubber used for soles was developed specifically for rock-climbing. Climbing shoes manufactured with a downward pointing toe box increase the ability to stand on small holds and pockets at the expense of both comfort and the ability to smear. Approach shoes are hybrids between light-weight hiking shoes and climbing shoes offering some of the qualities of each.  Shoe fit  Climbing shoes fit very closely to support the foot and allow the climber to use small footholds effectively. Most climbers forgo socks in order to achieve a more precise fit. As a result of their tightness, most climbing shoes, particularly the more aggressive or technical styles, are uncomfortable when properly fitted.  History  Early rock climbers used heavy-soled mountaineering boots studded with metal cleats and hobnails. An advance on this for dry rock, were boots with Vibram soles, with a pattern of rubber studs developed by Vitale Bramani in Italy in the 1930s. In postwar Britain, a new generation of climbers like Joe Brown began to climb harder routes wearing plimsolls (rubber-soled canvas sneakers), sometimes with woolen socks over them to improve grip.http://www.joe-brown.com/putting-joes-achievements-into- context.html Pierre Allain was an enthusiastic French rock climber who experimented with hard composite rubber-soled canvas boots; by the late 1950s his \\"PA\\" boots were being used by climbers worldwide.

It is the second busiest airport in Minnesota. It used to be \\"Rochester Municipal Airport\\", its name before adding customs and immigration facilities specifically for Mayo Clinic purposes in 1995. The airport covers and has two concrete runways: runway 13/31 and runway 2/20. Airline service is on American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines on commuter jets. Charter service is occasionally offered by Sun Country Airlines on Boeing 737s. The airport has a large FedEx Express terminal and a general aviation terminal. History The original Rochester airport was founded in 1928 by the Mayo Foundation to get patients from far- flung locations to the Mayo Clinic. It was in what is now southeast Rochester and occupied 285 acres (1.2 km¬≤). The following year 'Rochester Airport' was dedicated, and the Rochester Airport Company was founded as a subsidiary of the Mayo Foundation. Northwest Airlines began running Ford Trimotors to Rochester from St. Paul. Rochester was one of the first destinations from the Twin Cities in Northwest Airlines history, behind Chicago, Winnipeg, Green Bay, and Fargo. In 1940 the runways were paved and more land was acquired, bringing the airport's area to 370 acres (1.5 km¬≤). During World War II the Army Air Corps conducted training operations from the airport. In 1945 the Mayo Foundation gave the airport to the city of Rochester, but the Rochester Airport Company continued to operate the field under an agreement with the city. The airport was renamed Lobb Field in 1952. In 1960 it was decided to replace Lobb Field with a new airport southwest of town because it could not be expanded to allow larger airliners and was too close to the urban area of Rochester. The original Rochester Airport closed in 1961. In 1960 Rochester Municipal Airport opened at its current location south of downtown Rochester; in 1965 runway 13 was 6400 feet and runway 2 was 4000 feet. Northwest and Braniff moved to the new airport in 1960, but Ozark's DC-3s stayed at Lobb until 1961; North Central Airlines arrived in 1968 and Braniff left around the same time. The first jets were Northwest 727s in 1965. American Airlines began service to Chicago O'Hare in 1988. 1995 saw the addition of a US Customs post and it became the Rochester International Airport. TWA operated flights to St. Louis in early 2001, but these routes were dropped very soon due to the merger with American Airlines. On September 15, 2005, the primary runway was lengthened from 7,533' to 9,034' following a three-month closure for renovations; runway centerline and touchdown zone lighting were added. The change was made to allow large wide body aircraft, which had been weight- restricted upon departure. In 1970 Imperial Airways offered scheduled helicopter service to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. On December 4, 1970 Imperial Airways announced it was canceling its scheduled helicopter flights in Minnesota. Other routes that where cut its routes from Minneapolis- St Paul International Airport to Rochester, Minnesota and to downtown Minneapolis. In 2020 the airport received a $2,479,991 CARES Act award. 2009 tarmac stranding incident The Rochester International Airport was the site of the six-hour 2009 tarmac stranding incident that made international news and resulted in the first fines ever imposed on airline carriers by the U.S. Department of Transportation for stranding passengers on a tarmac. Future Plans for a new Terminal Building were recently updated to reflect continued use and investment into the existing Terminal including the addition of a US Customs Facility. In March 2019, plans for construction of an additional gate and jet bridge were announced. The proposal for the addition came after a large increase in passengers over the past year and recent congestion issues. In July 2019, the Rochester Airport Commission began accepting bids for the jet bridge project. The commission also discussed repaving parts of runway 02/20 as well as additional dining and shopping options in the terminal. At the end of July 2019 the airport received $3.3 million in federal grants to make improvements, such as the jet bridge project and runway reconstruction. In February 2020 the airport was awarded $750,000 in grant money by the US Department of Transportation for attracting new service, with the federal grant's stated purpose being \\"revenue guarantee and marketing program to attract new service to Denver, Co., on United Airlines.\\" https://www.postbulletin.com/news/business/federal-grant-funds-trial-route- from-rst-to-points-west/article_6e415362-533d-11ea-ba11-87b1a9ff1f62.html Airport directors noted that the grant does not guarantee the new destination yet and also does not exclude possible other destinations.

This effort led to the development of the programming language COBOL, the CODASYL Data Model, and other technical standards. CODASYL's members were individuals from industry and government involved in data processing activity. Its larger goal was to promote more effective data systems analysis, design, and implementation. The organization published specifications for various languages over the years, handing these over to official standards bodies (ISO, ANSI, or their predecessors) for formal standardization.  History  CODASYL is remembered almost entirely for two activities: its work on the development of the COBOL language and its activities in standardizing database interfaces. It also worked on a wide range of other topics, including end-user form interfaces and operating system control languages, but these projects had little lasting impact. The remainder of this section is concerned with CODASYL's database activities. In 1965 CODASYL formed a List Processing Task Force. This group was chartered to develop COBOL language extensions for processing collections of records; the name arose because Charles Bachman's IDS system (which was the main technical input to the project) managed relationships between records using chains of pointers. In 1967 the group renamed itself the Data Base Task Group (DBTG), and its first report in January 1968 was entitled COBOL extensions to handle data bases. The \\"set\\", the basic structure of the CODASYL database model. A set consists of one owner record and n member records (these are labeled as \\"parent\\" and \\"child\\" in the diagram, but the CODASYL terminology is \\"owner\\" and \\"member\\"). In the above example, we were looking at a basic set which embodies a 1:N (Owner:Member) relationship. In October 1969 the DBTG published its first language specifications for the network database model which became generally known as the CODASYL Data Model. This specification in fact defined several separate languages: a data definition language (DDL) to define the schema of the database, another DDL to create one or more subschemas defining application views of the database; and a data manipulation language (DML) defining verbs for embedding in the COBOL programming language to request and update data in the database. Although the work was focused on COBOL, the idea of a host-language independent database was starting to emerge, prompted by IBM's advocacy of PL/I as a COBOL replacement. In 1971, largely in response to the need for programming language independence, the work was reorganized: development of the Data Description Language was continued by the Data Description Language Committee, while the COBOL DML was taken over by the COBOL language committee. With hindsight, this split had unfortunate consequences. The two groups never quite managed to synchronize their specifications, leaving vendors to patch up the differences. The inevitable consequence was a lack of interoperability among implementations. A number of vendors implemented database products conforming (roughly) to the DBTG specifications: the best-known implementations were Honeywell's-- originally General Electric's-- Integrated Data Store (IDS/2), HP's IMAGE Cullinet's Integrated Database Management System IDMS, ICL's 2900 IDMS (derived from Cullinet's product), Univac's DMS-1100, and Digital Equipment Corporation's DBMS32. Cullinet, originally known as Cullinane Database Systems, obtained the technology from B.F. Goodrich. Cullinet was eventually sold to Computer Associates, which as of 2007 still sells and supports a version of IDMS. ANSI and ISO adopted the Codasyl database specifications under the name Network Database Language (NDL), with work taking place within the same working group (X3H2) as SQL standardization. An ISO standard for NDL was ratified as ISO 8907:1987,http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16434 but, as it never had any practical effect on implementations, it was formally withdrawn in 1998. Some of the CODASYL committees continue their work today, but CODASYL itself no longer exists. The records of CODASYL were donated to the Charles Babbage Institute.See a finding guide to Conference on Data Systems Languages Records, 1959-1987. Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota CBI also hold the archival records for American National Standards Institute X3H2 records.

Overview PL/C was developed with the specific goal of being used for teaching programming. It is based on IBM's PL/I language. Work on this project was based on a prior Cornell compiler for a language named CUPL (Cornell University Programming Language). One reason why PL/C was widely used in college-level programming courses was its avoidance of a known problem named \\"Cascading Diagnostics\\", wherein one error is \\"fixed\\" and results in a secondary, tertiary and onwards series of error messages. The two researchers and academic teachers who designed PL/C were Richard W. Conway and Thomas R. Wilcox. They submitted the famous article \\"Design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for PL/I\\" published in the Communications of ACM in March 1973, pages 169-179. PL/C. which is a subset of PL/I, eliminated some of the more complex features of PL/I, and added extensive debugging and error recovery facilities. A program that runs without error under the PL/C compiler should run under PL/I and produce the same results, unless certain incompatible diagnostic features, such as a macro section (begun by a $MACRO statement and finished by a $MEND statement), were used. The PL/C compiler had the unusual capability of never failing to compile any program, through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements.

The word \\"buildering\\", sometimes misspelled bildering, is a portmanteau, combining the word building with the climbing term bouldering. If done without ropes or protection far off the ground, buildering is extremely dangerous. It is often practiced outside legal bounds, and is thus mostly undertaken at night. Night climbing is a particular branch of buildering which has been practiced for many years in a variety of locations, especially at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, England. Night climbing, as distinct from buildering, is performed mainly by undergraduates under cover of darkness. The term \\"night climbing\\" has replaced the older term \\"roof climbing\\". The philosophy behind Night Climbing has undergone great change during the 21st Century, with urban disciplines such as Parkour having a heavy influence on the evolution of Night Climbing techniques and movements. Adepts of buildering who are seen climbing on buildings without authorization are regularly met by police forces upon completing their exploit. Spectacular acts of buildering, such as free soloing skyscrapers, are usually accomplished by lone, experienced climbers, sometimes attracting large crowds of passers-by and media attention. These remain relatively rare. Buildering can also take a form more akin to bouldering, which tends towards ascending or traversing shorter sections of buildings and structures. While still generally frowned upon by property owners, some, such as the University of Colorado at Boulder and Tufts University, turn a blind eye towards the practice in many locations. Although often practised as a solo sport, buildering has also become a popular group activity. As in more traditional rock climbing, routes are established and graded for difficulty. History \\"Struck with a rash impulse,\\" Han Qizhi, a 31-year-old shoe salesman, climbed the 88-story Jin Mao Building barehanded. In 1895, the great alpinist Geoffrey Winthrop Young, started to climb the roofs of Cambridge University, England. Students had been scrambling up the university architecture for years,Geoffrey Winthrop Young: Poet, educator, mountaineer (1995), by Alan Hankinson, published by Hodder & Stoughton, London but Young was the first to document this activity. He wrote and published a buildering guide to Trinity College.The Roof Climber's Guide to Trinity (1900), written by Geoffrey Winthrop Young, published anonymously, W P Spalding, Cambridge, England Then in 1905, while a master at Eton College, Young produced another small volume on buildering, spoofing mountaineering.Wall and Roof Climbing (1905), written by Geoffrey Winthrop Young, published anonymously, Spottiswoode & Co., Eton College, England In 1905, Harry H. Gardiner began buildering. He successfully climbed over 700 buildings in Europe and North America, usually wearing ordinary street clothes and using no special equipment. In 1910, George Polley started his climbing career when the owner of a clothing store promised him a suit if he would climb to the roof of the building. He succeeded, and went on to climb over 2,000 buildings. During the years from 1915 to 1920, buildering in New York City reached its peak. Before 1915, there were few skyscrapers in New York City, and after 1920, the city authorities had legislated to outlaw buildering. During this era, a number of daredevils climbed the tall buildings, but several of them fell to their deaths in the attempt. In 1921, a group of undergraduates from St John's College, Cambridge, published a buildering guide to that college.The Roof Climber's Guide to St Johns (1921), written by a group of students including Hartley, Grag and Darlington, under the pseudonym \\"A.

In 1930, John Hurst wrote the second edition of Geoffrey Winthrop Young's buildering guide to Trinity.The Roof Climber's Guide to Trinity, 2nd edition (1930), written by John Hurst, published anonymously, W P Spalding, Cambridge, England In 1937, a comprehensive and lighthearted account of Cambridge night climbing (undergraduate buildering) appeared in popular print,The Night Climbers of Cambridge (1937), written by No√´l Howard Symington under the pseudonym \\"Whipplesnaith\\", Chatto & Windus Ltd, London written by No√´l Howard Symington, under the pseudonym \\"Whipplesnaith\\".

In 1960, Richard Williams wrote the third edition of the Trinity buildering guide.The Night Climber's Guide to Trinity, 3rd edition (1960), written by Richard Williams, published anonymously, Weatherhead Ltd, Cambridge, England Night climbing remained popular in Cambridge during these post-war years. In 1970, a book entitled \\"Night Climbing in Cambridge\\" was published under the pseudonym \\"Hederatus\\".Cambridge nightclimbing (1970), written under the pseudonym \\"Hederatus\\", Chatto & Windus Ltd, London Buildering also featured prominently in a book by F A Reeve, published in 1977.Varsity Rags and Hoaxes (1977), written by F A Reeve, published by Oleander Press, Cambridge, England In 1977, George Willig climbed the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

In 2011, they published an omnibus edition of the three Trinity guides,The Roof-Climber's Guide to Trinity, Omnibus Edition (2011), Oleander Press, Cambridge, England. including an introduction by Richard Williams which reviewed the history of night climbing in Cambridge from the 18th century to the present day. This introduction removed the cloak of anonymity that had previously protected the identities of the first nocturnal explorers. From around 2008, buildering (also known as \\"roofing\\") became popular amongst teenagers and young adults in eastern European countries including Russia and the Ukraine. They shared footage of their achievements on video portals such as YouTube (Mustang Wanted). In August 2016, a young man going by the name Stephen Rogata attempted to scale New York City's 68-storey Trump Tower using climbing gear and giant suction cups; NYPD officers apprehended him at the 21st floor. The identification of the first recreational or professional builderer remains an open question, but at Cambridge, Geoffrey Winthrop Young is generally regarded as the original pioneer. Famous builderers Petronas Tower 2 in March 2007. On this occasion, he was arrested at the 60th floor. Alain Robert has achieved world-wide renown and is widely regarded as the greatest of all builderers. In 2011, he climbed the world's tallest building, the 830-meter Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. On that occasion, he used a harness in accordance with safety procedure, but most of his climbs have been free soloing. Other well-known structures that Robert has climbed include the Empire State Building in New York City, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, the Sears Tower in Chicago, the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, The Doha Torch in Doha, Taipei 101 in Taiwan, and each of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He has also climbed a number of famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and the Montparnasse Tower in France, and the Sydney Opera House in Australia. Robert has been arrested at the top of many of the major buildings he has climbed. He was born in France in 1962 as Robert Alain Phillipe, and is popularly known as \\"the French Spider-Man\\" and the \\"Human Spider\\". In the 1980s, Dan Goodwin, aka SpiderDan, aka Skyscraperman, in advocacy for high-rise firefighting and rescue, scaled many of the world's tallest buildings and structures including the Sears Tower, the John Hancock Center, the North Tower of the World Trade Center, the Parque Central Complex in Caracas, Venezuela, and the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada. In 2010, Goodwin, now a stage four cancer survivor, scaled San Francisco, California's sixty- storey Millennium Tower to call attention to the fire department's inability to conduct rescue operations in the upper floors of skyscrapers. At least six builderers became known as \\"The Human Fly\\", all from the United States, as follows: * George Willig, who climbed the South Tower of the World Trade Center in 1977. Like Alain Robert, he was also known as \\"Spider-Man\\", after the comic hero who was first published by Marvel in 1962. * John Ciampa, who climbed between 1942 and 1952. He was a stuntman and entertainer, and was also known as the \\"Flying Phantom\\" and the \\"Brooklyn Tarzan\\". * James A Dearing, who scaled the Rutherford County Courthouse in 1923, but fell to his death after completing the climb. His stage name was Roy Royce. * Harry F Young, who was hired in 1923 to climb the Hotel Martinique in New York City, to promote the silent movie Safety Last! He lost his grip on the ascent, and fell nine stories to his death. * George Polley, who climbed between 1910 and 1920. He died at the age of 29 from a brain tumour. * Harry Gardiner, who climbed over 700 buildings in the United States and Europe between 1905 and 1918, usually wearing street clothes and tennis shoes, with no climbing equipment. In the 1930s, Whipplesnaith (No√´l Symington) climbed many buildings in Cambridge, England.

Located at the southernmost end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is primarily known as one of the world's most popular destinations for windsports. Tarifa lies on the Costa de la Luz (\\"coast of light\\") and across the Strait of Gibraltar facing Morocco. At exactly 36 degrees latitude, the Punta de Tarifa is the southernmost point of continental Europe. (The only parts of Europe farther south are islands - including the Greek island of Gavdos, which is the southernmost point of Europe.) Across the Strait of Gibraltar, the African capitals of Tangier, Tunis and Algiers are to the south of Tarifa. There are several villages which depend economically on Tarifa in the municipality, including Tahivilla, Facinas, and Bolonia. History Ruins of Baelo Claudia near Bolonia Beach Castle of St Catalina. It was thought that Tarifa was once the site of the Roman settlement of Julia Transducta (also known as Julia Joza, or just Transducta). However, that settlement is now thought to have been where Algeciras now stands, while there is strong evidence that Casas de Porro, Valdevaqueros (Tarifa) was the site of the settlement of Mellaria. Tarifa was given its present name after the attack of Tarif ibn Malik in 710, a Berber military commander of Musa bin Nusayr.Naturalis Historia, 3,7 The village of Bolonia near Tarifa was also populated in Roman times (called Baelo Claudia). Roman ruins still exist near the village today. After the Islamic conquest of southern Spain, the city was fortified starting from the 10th century. Later Tarifa was held by the taifa of Algeciras (1031) and by that of Seville (1057), and subsequently by the Almoravids. After the latter's fall, it lived a short period under another taifa of Algeciras (1231), until becoming part of the Kingdom of Granada. In 1292 it was conquered by Sancho IV of Castile, and two years later it resisted a siege by North African Islamic troops. The town resisted another siege in 1340 from Marinid, eventually leading to the Battle of R√≠o Salado. In 1514 it became the seat of a marquisate (Marquiss of Tarifa), including also Bornos, Espera and Alcal√° de los Gazules. In the course of the Peninsular War, Tarifa was besieged by French troops on 20 December 1810, and again on 18 December 1811. In both of these cases the town was defended by British troops from Gibraltar as the Spanish and British were allies against the French. During the 1811‚Äì12 Siege of Tarifa there were 3,000 defending troops with 1,200 of those British, including Colonel Charles Holloway who as commanding Royal Engineer made improvements to Tarifa's defences. On 19 December the town was attacked again by General Laval, who bombarded the town over Christmas to the point where surrender was demanded on 30 December. Both the British and Spanish commanders refused to comply and their defiance was rewarded by rain that started the next day. By 5 January the attacking force realised that their powder was wet and their guns were bogged down in mud, and retreated. Name The name \\"Tarifa\\" is derived from the name of the Umayyad Caliphate military commander, Tarif ibn Malik. Main sights Los Lances Beach. Windsurfing in Tarifa Watching fin whales off Tarifa. Historical landmarks of the city include: *the well-preserved Guzman castle, near the port, built by order of caliph Abd-ar- Rahman III (960). Annexed are the Guzm√°n el Bueno Tower (13th century) and the church of St. Mary, on the site of a former mosque. *remains of the medieval walls. Of three gates once existing, today only the Puerta de Jerez (13th century) has survived. *Church of St. Matthew, built in the early 16th century in Gothic style, also over a former mosque. The fa√ßade was redesigned by Torcuato Cay√≥n de la Vega in 1774. *The ruins of the Roman city of Baelo Claudia, located nearby. *Tarifa has become a popular spot for northern Europeans to spend their summers. *Tarifa's unique wind conditions have made the beaches at Playa de Los Lances, Valdevaqueros and Punta Paloma the most popular in Europe with windsurfers and kitesurfers. The funnel created by the Strait of Gibraltar creates a Venturi effect when either the Levante (Easterly wind from Africa) or Poniente (Westerly wind from the Atlantic) is blowing. These two winds prevail in Tarifa for over 300 days most years, meaning Tarifa experiences exceptionally strong and consistent winds throughout the year. In addition, localised thermal winds at locations such as Valdevaqueros mean that even when the prevailing wind is not strong it is often possible to windsurf and kite surf in Tarifa These unique wind conditions are also the reason Tarifa is dotted with countless wind turbines. Tarifa is located within the Intercontinental Mediterranean Biosphere Reserve, a renowned place to watch migrating birds, in particular the storks which cross the Straits of Gibraltar in spring and autumn. Also whale and dolphin watching can be done as there are several species living on the 14 kilometre-wide Straits, for instance the Pilot whale . Cinema Tarifa is renowned for its African Film Festival, whose first edition took place in 2004. Transportation Bolonia Beach. There are regular ferry services connecting Tarifa with Tangier (40 minutes) and Ceuta (1 hour) from the ferry port. Bus services run from the bus station on Calle Batalla de Salado. There are regular services between Tarifa and Algeciras, about 20 km to the northeast, and Seville about 200 km to the north.tgcomes.es: \\"LA L√çNEA - SEVILLA\\" Direct buses also run to M√°laga and C√°diz. In high summer a special kitesurfing bus runs along the A7 between Tarifa bus station and Camping Jardin de las Dunas, stopping at popular hotels and campsites along the route. There is a taxi rank on the Avenida Andalucia. It is about 5 minutes walk from the bus station and is located just outside the Puerto de Jerez (the main entrance to the old town) at the junction of Avenida Andalucia and Calle Batalla de Salado. Climate Tarifa features a Mediterranean climate with Oceanic influences, with warm summers and very mild winters. Rain is concentrated in winter, with the summers being largely dry. Because of its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, precipitation in the wet period is quite high; monthly averages exceed 80mm in the two wettest months, December and January. The influence of the ocean has the additional effect of creating a very small annual variation in temperature. Winters are warmer than inland Spain - and summers are cooler than most of the country - the average daily high in the hottest month, August, is only 24 ¬∞C, more than 10 ¬∞C cooler than the temperatures experienced further inland in the Guadalquivir valley, and also significantly cooler than those felt further east along the Mediterranean coast in places such as M√°laga and Almer√≠a and even further west in Huelva and the Algarve coast of Portugal, as well as nearby Gibraltar and Tanger, which renders Tarifa to be an extreme microclimate. Surroundings The intentional community \\"Molino de Guadalmesi\\", which is part of the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN), is located about 13 km north-east from Tarifa. In literature *The city of Tarifa is depicted in the 1986 worldwide bestseller fiction novel, The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho. The lead protagonist, a shepherd boy, visits the city to meet an interpreter of dreams and ask him to interpret a recurrent dream he has had twice. His life takes a dramatic turn when he meets an old king of Salem named Melchizedek at a city marketplace.

Founding of agency Magnum was founded in Paris in 1947 by Robert Capa, David \\"Chim\\" Seymour, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger and William Vandivert (all photographers), Rita Vandivert and Maria Eisner, based on an idea of Capa's. (Seymour, Cartier-Bresson and Rodger were all absent from the meeting at which it was founded.Russell Miller, Magnum: Fifty Years at the Front Line of History (New York: Grove, 1998; ), pp. 49‚Äì50. In response to a letter telling him that he was a member, Rodger wrote that Magnum seemed a good idea but, \\"It all sounded too halcyon to be true,\\" when Capa had told him of it and, \\"I rather dismissed the whole thing from my mind\\".Miller, Magnum, p. 53) Rita Vandivert was the first President, and head of the New York office; Maria Eisner the head of the Paris office.Miller, Magnum, p.51. The plan was for Rodger to cover Africa and the Middle East; Cartier-Bresson to cover south and east Asia; Seymour and William Vandivert to cover Europe and the United States, respectively; and Capa to be free to follow his curiosity and events. Magnum is one of the first photographic cooperatives, owned and administered entirely by members. The staff serve a support role for the photographers, who retain all copyrights to their own work. The Magnum cooperative has included photojournalists from across the world, who have covered many historical events of the 20th century. The cooperative's archive includes photographs depicting family life, drugs, religion, war, poverty, famine, crime, government and celebrities. Although it has been asserted that the name \\"Magnum\\" was chosen because the founding members always drank a bottle of champagne during the first meetings,Die Leica-Geschichte, TV- Documentary, can be viewed here (YouTube). Russell Miller writes: > It was . . . presumably agreed by those present [at the first meeting] that > Magnum was a fine new name for such a bold new venture, indicative as it was > of greatness in its literal Latin translation, toughness in its gun > connotation and celebration in its champagne mode.Miller, Magnum, p.49. Boy destroying piano at Pant-y-Waen, South Wales, by Philip Jones Griffiths, 1961  Governance  Magnum is owned by its photographers, who act as shareholders. Each full member of Magnum has a vote in proposals made at a meeting held once a year, called the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Photographers with the status of contributor or correspondent are represented by Magnum but have no voting rights. Full members can choose to become contributors after 23 years of membership; this status gives them increased liberty to work outside Magnum, at the cost of their voting rights. Elections of new members Abbas about Magnum In the early years of Magnum, membership had generally come about by the personal invitation of Robert Capa. However, in 1955 a three-stage membership system was set up that continues to this dayMiller, Magnum, p.127. and is described below. Until 1953 there were also a large number of stringers who used Magnum but were not members.Miller, Magnum, pp. 70, 97, 106. Magnum's photographers meet once a year, during the last weekend in June, in New York, Paris or London, to discuss the cooperative's business. One day of the meeting is reserved to review potential new members' portfolios and vote on admitting individuals. An approved applicant is invited to become a 'Nominee Member' of Magnum, a category of membership that provides a chance for members and the individual to get to know each other, but that includes no binding commitments on either side. After two years of Nominee membership, a photographer may present another portfolio if wanting to apply for 'Associate Membership'. If successful, the photographer is bound by the rules of the agency, and enjoys its facilities and worldwide representation. The difference between an Associate Member and a full Member is that an Associate is not a Director of the Company and does not have voting rights in the corporate decision-making. After two more years, an Associate wanting to be considered for full membership presents another portfolio of work for consideration by the members. Once elected as a full member, the individual is a member of Magnum for life or for as long as the photographer chooses. No member photographer of Magnum has ever been asked to leave. Accusations of child protection issues with Magnum's digital archive Magnum Photos' digital archive constitutes more than 1 million images, that Magnum licenses through its website. In August 2020, the Magnum website was taken offline after issues were raised by theFstoppers photography website and amplified on social media by others including J√∂rg Colberg. Given the tags on the photos, there was concern that Magnum was making available photographs of children featuring nudity; that documented encounters that constituted a record of acts of child sexual abuse; and that were problematic in terms of the way they had been labelled for searching. \\"Much of the criticism [. . .] has focused on a series of photographs by the US photographer David Alan Harvey from his time documenting sex workers in Bangkok in 1989.\\" In a statement Magnum said it will re-examine the content of its archive, and has since made its website available again but without Harvey's Bangkok series. Photographic collection In February 2010, Magnum announced that Michael Dell's venture capital firm MSD Capital had acquired a collection of nearly 200,000 original press prints of images taken by Magnum photographers. It had formed a partnership with the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin to preserve, catalog, and make photographs available to the general public. In September 2013 it was announced MSD Capital donated the collection to the Ransom Center. A preliminary inventory is available for researchers who wish to use the collection.

In other words, it is a frame of reference to better understand how individuals interact with one another to create symbolic worlds, and in return, how these worlds shape individual behaviors. It is a framework that helps understand how society is preserved and created through repeated interactions between individuals. The interpretation process that occurs between interactions helps create and recreate meaning. It is the shared understanding and interpretations of meaning that affect the interaction between individuals. Individuals act on the premise of a shared understanding of meaning within their social context. Thus, interaction and behavior is framed through the shared meaning that objects and concepts have attached to them. From this view, people live in both natural and symbolic environments. Symbolic interactionism comes from a sociological perspective which developed around the middle of the twentieth century and that continues to be influential in some areas of the discipline. It is particularly important in microsociology and social psychology. It is derived from the American philosophy of pragmatism and particularly from the work of George Herbert Mead, as a pragmatic method to interpret social interactions. R. Collins views symbolic interactionism as studying the way the social world is created through interaction between individuals and their environment. History  George Herbert Mead  Symbolic interaction was conceived by George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley. Mead argued that people's selves are social products, but that these selves are also purposive and creative, and believed that the true test of any theory was that it was \\"useful in solving complex social problems\\". Mead's influence was said to be so powerful that sociologists regard him as the one \\"true founder\\" of the symbolic interactionism tradition. Although Mead taught in a philosophy department, he is best known by sociologists as the teacher who trained a generation of the best minds in their field. Strangely, he never set forth his wide-ranging ideas in a book or systematic treatise. After his death in 1931, his students pulled together class notes and conversations their mentor and published Mind, Self and Society in his name. It is a common misconception that John Dewey was the leader of this sociological theory; according to The Handbook of Symbolic Interactionism, Mead was undoubtedly the individual who \\"transformed the inner structure of the theory, moving it to a higher level of theoretical complexity.\\"Reynolds, Larry T., and Nancy J. Herman-Kinney. 1958(2003). Handbook of Symbolic Interactionism. Walnut Creek, Calif.: AltaMira Press. . OCLC 51059349. George Herbert Mead Mind, Self and Society is the book published by Mead's students based on his lectures and teaching, and the title of the book highlights the core concept of social interactionism. Mind refers to an individual's ability to use symbols to create meanings for the world around the individual ‚Äì individuals use language and thought to accomplish this goal. Self refers to an individual's ability to reflect on the way that the individual is perceived by others. Finally, society, according to Mead, is where all of these interactions are taking place. A general description of Mead's compositions portray how outside social structures, classes, and power and abuse affect the advancement of self, personality for gatherings verifiably denied of the ability to characterize themselves.  Herbert Blumer  Herbert Blumer, a student and interpreter of Mead, coined the term and put forward an influential summary: people act a certain way towards things based on the meaning those things already have, and these meanings are derived from social interaction and modified through interpretation. Blumer was a social constructionist, and was influenced by John Dewey; as such, this theory is very phenomenologically-based. Given that Blumer was the first to use symbolic interaction as a term, he is known as the founder of symbolic interaction. He believed that the \\"Most human and humanizing activity that people engage in is talking to each other.\\" According to Blumer, human groups are created by people and it is only actions between them that define a society. He argued that with interaction and through interaction individuals are able to \\"produce common symbols by approving, arranging, and redefining them.\\" Having said that, interaction is shaped by a mutual exchange of interpretation, the ground of socialization. Other theorists While having less influential work in the discipline, Charles Horton Cooley and William Isaac Thomas are considered to be influential representatives of the theory. Cooley's work on connecting society and the individuals influenced Mead's further workings. Cooley felt society and the individuals could only be understood in relationship to each other. Cooley's concept of the ‚Äúlooking- glass self,‚Äù influenced Mead‚Äôs theory of self and symbolic interactionism. W. I. Thomas is also known as a representative of symbolic interactionism. His main work was a theory of human motivation addressing interactions between individuals and the \\"social sources of behaviors.\\" He attempted to \\"explain the proper methodological approach to social life; develop a theory of human motivation; spell out a working conception of adult socialization; and provide the correct perspective on deviance and disorganization.\\" A majority of scholars agree with Thomas. Two other theorists who have influenced symbolic interaction theory are Yrj√∂ Engestr√∂m and David Middleton. Engestr√∂m and Middleton explained the usefulness of symbolic interactionism in the communication field in a variety of work settings, including \\"courts of law, health care, computer software design, scientific laboratory, telephone sales, control, repair, and maintenance of advanced manufacturing systems\\". Other scholars credited for their contribution to the theory are Thomas, Park, James, Horton Cooley, Znaniecki, Baldwin, Redfield, and Wirth. Unlike other social sciences, symbolic interactionism emphasizes greatly on the ideas of action instead of culture, class and power. According to behaviorism, Darwinism, pragmatism, as well as Max Weber, action theory contributed significantly to the formation of social interactionism as a theoretical perspective in communication studies. Assumptions, premises, and research methodology  Assumptions  Most symbolic interactionists believe a physical reality does indeed exist by an individual's social definitions, and that social definitions do develop in part or in relation to something \\"real\\". People thus do not respond to this reality directly, but rather to the social understanding of reality; i.e., they respond to this reality indirectly through a kind of filter which consists of individuals' different perspectives. This means that humans exist not in the physical space composed of realities, but in the \\"world\\" composed only of \\"objects\\". Three assumptions frame symbolic interactionism: # Individuals construct meaning via the communication process. # Self-concept is a motivation for behavior. # A unique relationship exists between the individual and society.  Premises  Having defined some of the underlying assumptions of symbolic interactionism, it is necessary to address the premises that each assumption supports. According to Blumer (1969), there are three premises that can be derived from the assumptions above. 1) \\"Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things.\\" The first premise includes everything that a human being may note in their world, including physical objects, actions and concepts. Essentially, individuals behave towards objects and others based on the personal meanings that the individual has already given these items. Blumer was trying to put emphasis on the meaning behind individual behaviors, specifically speaking, psychological and sociological explanations for those actions and behaviors. 2) \\"The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society.\\" The second premise explains the meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with other humans. Blumer, following Mead, claimed people interact with each other by interpreting or defining each other's actions instead of merely reacting to each other's actions. Their \\"response\\" is not made directly to the actions of one another but instead is based on the meaning which they attach to such actions. Thus, human interaction is mediated by the use of symbols and signification, by interpretation, or by ascertaining the meaning of one another's actions. Meaning is either taken for granted and pushed aside as an unimportant element which need not to be investigated, or it is regarded as a mere neutral link or one of the causal chains between the causes or factors responsible for human behavior and this behavior as the product of such factors. 3) \\"The Meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she encounters.\\" Symbolic interactionists describe thinking as an inner conversation. Mead called this inner dialogue minding, which is the delay in one's thought process that happens when one thinks about what they will do next. These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive processKuwabara T., and K. Yamaguchi. 2013. \\"An Introduction to the Sociological Perspective of Symbolic Interactionism.\\" The Joint Journal of the National Universities in Kyushu, Education and Humanities 1(1):1-11. used by the person in dealing with the things he or she encounters. We naturally talk to ourselves in order to sort out the meaning of a difficult situation. But first, we need language. Before we can think, we must be able to interact symbolically. The emphasis on symbols, negotiated meaning, and social construction of society brought attention to the roles people play. Role- taking is a key mechanism that permits people to see another person's perspective to understand what an action might mean to another person. Role- taking is a part of our lives at an early age, for instance, playing house and pretending to be someone else. There is an improvisational quality to roles; however, actors often take on a script that they follow. Because of the uncertainty of roles in social contexts, the burden of role-making is on the person in the situation. In this sense, we are proactive participants in our environment.  Research methodology  The majority of interactionist research uses qualitative research methods, like participant observation, to study aspects of social interaction, and/or individuals' selves. Participant observation allows researchers to access symbols and meanings, as in Howard Becker's Art Worlds and Arlie Hochschild's The Managed Heart. They argue that close contact and immersion in the everyday activities of the participants is necessary for understanding the meaning of actions, defining situations and the process that actors construct the situation through their interaction. Because of this close contact, interactions cannot remain completely liberated of value commitments. In most cases, they make use of their values in choosing what to study; however, they seek to be objective in how they conduct the research. Therefore, the symbolic-interaction approach is a micro-level orientation focusing on human interaction in specific situations. Five central ideas There are five central ideas to symbolic interactionism according to Joel M. Charon (2004): #\\"The human being must be understood as a social person. It is the constant search for social interaction that leads us to do what we do. Instead of focusing on the individual and his or her personality, or on how the society or social situation causes human behavior, symbolic interactionism focuses on the activities that take place between actors. Interaction is the basic unit of study. Individuals are created through interaction; society too is created through social interaction. What we do depends on interaction with others earlier in our lifetimes, and it depends on our interaction right now. Social interaction is central to what we do. If we want to understand cause, focus on social interaction. #The human being must be understood as a thinking being. Human action is not only interaction among individuals but also interaction within the individual. It is not our ideas or attitudes or values that are as important as the constant active ongoing process of thinking. We are not simply conditioned, we are not simply beings who are influenced by those around us, we are not simply products of society. We are, to our very core, thinking animals, always conversing with ourselves as we interact with others. If we want to understand cause, focus on human thinking. #Humans do not sense their environment directly, instead, humans define the situation they are in. An environment may actually exist, but it is our definition of it that is important. Definition does not simply randomly happen; instead, it results from ongoing social interaction and thinking. #The cause of human action is the result of what is occurring in our present situation. Cause unfolds in the present social interaction, present thinking, and present definition. It is not society's encounters with us in our past, that causes action nor is it our own past experience that does. It is, instead, social interaction, thinking, definition of the situation that takes place in the present. Our past enters into our actions primarily because we think about it and apply it to the definition of the present situation. #Human beings are described as active beings in relation to their environment. Words such as conditioning, responding, controlled, imprisoned, and formed are not used to describe the human being in symbolic interaction. In contrast to other social-scientific perspectives humans are not thought of as being passive in relation to their surroundings, but actively involved in what they do.\\" Central interactionist themes To Blumer's conceptual perspective, he put them in three core propositions: that people act toward things, including each other, on the basis of the meanings they have for them; that these meanings are derived through social interaction with others; and that these meanings are managed and transformed through an interpretive process that people use to make sense of and handle the objects that constitute their social worlds. This perspective can also be described as three core principles- Meaning, Language and Thinking- in which social constructs are formed. The principle of meaning is the center of human behavior. Language provides meaning by providing means to symbols. These symbols differentiate social relations of humans from that of animals. By humans giving meaning to symbols, they can express these things with language. In turn, symbols form the basis of communication. Symbols become imperative components for the formation of any kind of communicative act. Thinking then changes the interpretation of individuals as it pertains to symbols.  Snow's Four Principles  Keeping Blumer's earlier work in mind David A. Snow, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, suggests four broader and even more basic orienting principles: human agency, interactive determination, symbolization, and emergence. Snow uses these four principles as the thematic bases for identifying and discussing contributions to the study of social movements. # Human agency: emphasizes the active, willful, goal-seeking character of human actors. The emphasis on agency focuses attention on those actions, events, and moments in social life in which agentic action is especially palpable. # Interactive determination: specifies that understanding of focal objects of analysis, whether they are self-concepts, identities, roles, practices, or even social movements. Basically this means, neither individual, society, self, or others exist only in relation to each other and therefore can be fully understood only in terms of their interaction. # Symbolization: highlights the processes through which events and conditions, artifacts, people, and other environmental features that take on particular meanings, becoming nearly only objects of orientation. Human behavior is partly contingent on what the object of orientation symbolizes or means. # Emergence: focuses on attention on the processual and non-habituated side of social life, focusing not only on organization and texture of social life, but also associated meaning and feelings. The principle of emergence points us not only to the possibility of new forms of social life and system meaning but also to transformations in existing forms of social organization.  Applications  Symbolic interaction can be used to explain one's identity in terms of roles being \\"ideas and principles on 'what to do' in a given situation,\\" as noted by Hewitt. Symbolic Interactionist identity presents in 3 categories- situated, personal and social. Situated identity refers to the ability to view themselves as others do. This is often a snapshot view in that it is short, but can be very impactful. From this experience, one wishes to differentiate themselves from others and the personal identity comes to exist. This view is when one wishes to make themselves known for who they truly are, not the view of others. From the personal identity taking place, comes the social identity where connections and likeness are made with individuals sharing similar identities or identity traits. This viewpoint of symbolic interactionism can be applied to the use of social networking sites and how one's identity is presented on those sites. With social networking sites, one can boast (or post) their identity through their newsfeed. The personal identity presents itself in the need for individuals to post milestones that one has achieved, in efforts to differentiate themselves. The social identity presents itself when individuals \\"tag\\" others in their posts, pictures, etc. Situated identities may be present in the need to defend something on social media or arguments that occur in comments, where one feels it necessary to \\"prove\\" themselves. Coming from the viewpoint that we learn, or at least desire, how to expect other people's reactions/responses to things, Bruce Link and his colleagues studied how expectations of the reactions of others can affect the mental illness stigma. The participants of the study were individuals with psychosis who answered questions relating to discrimination, stigma, and rejection. The goal of the study was to determine whether others' expectations affect the participants' internalized stigmas, anticipated rejection, concerns with staying in, and other. Results found that high levels of internalized stigma were only present in the minority, however, anticipation of rejection, stigma consciousness, perceived devaluation discrimination and concerns with staying in were found to be more prevalent in participants. These perceptions were correlated with the outcomes of withdrawal, self-esteem and isolation from relatives. The study found that anticipation of rejection played the largest role in internalized stigmas.Link, Bruce, Jennifer Wells, Jo Phelan, Lawrence Yang. 2015. \\"Understanding the importance of 'symbolic interaction stigma': How expectations about the reactions of others adds to the burden of mental illness stigma.\\" Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal 38(2):117‚Äì24. doi:10.1037/prj0000142. New media thumb New media is a term used to define all that is related to the internet and the interplay between technology, images and sound. As studies of online community proliferate, the concept of online community has become a more accepted social construct. Studies encompassed discursive communities; identity; community as social reality; networking; the public sphere; and ease and anonymity in interactions.Dubois, Shelley. 30 June 2009. \\"Anthropologist Wows Personal Democracy Forum. Whatever.\\" Wired Magazine. Retrieved on 27 March 2020. These studies show that online community is an important social construct in terms of its cultural, structural, political and economic character. It has been demonstrated that people's ideas about community are formed, in part, through interactions both in online forums and face-to-face. As a result, people act in their communities according to the meanings they derive about their environment, whether online or offline, from those interactions. This perspective reveals that online communication may very well take on different meanings for different people depending on information, circumstance, relationships, power, and other systems that make up communities of practice. People enact community the way it is conceived and the meaning of community evolves as they come up with new ways to utilize it. Given this reality, scholars are continually challenged to research and understand how online communities are comprised, how they function, and how they are connected to offline social life. Symbolic interaction theory was discussed in The Cyberself: The Self-ing Project goes online, Symbolic Interaction in the Digital Age. Laura Robinson discusses how symbolic interaction theory explains the way individuals create a sense of self through their interactions with others. However, she believes advances in technology have changed this. The article investigates the manner in which individuals form their online identity. She uses symbolic interaction theory to examine the formation of the cyber \\"I\\" and a digital \\"generalized other\\". In the article, Robinson suggests individuals form new identities on the internet. She argues these cyber identities are not necessarily the way the individual would be perceived offline. Criticisms Symbolic interactionists are often criticized for being overly impressionistic in their research methods and somewhat unsystematic in their theories. It is argued that the theory is not one theory, but rather, the framework for many different theories. Additionally, some theorists have a problem with symbolic interaction theory due to its lack of testability. These objections, combined with the fairly narrow focus of interactionist research on small-group interactions and other social psychological issues, have relegated the interactionist camp to a minority position among sociologists (albeit a fairly substantial minority). Much of this criticism arose during the 1970s in the U.S. when quantitative approaches to sociology were dominant, and perhaps the best known of these is by Alvin Gouldner. Framework and theories Some critiques of symbolic interactionism are based on the assumption that it is a theory, and the critiques apply the criteria for a \\"good\\" theory to something that does not claim to be a theory. Some critics find the symbolic interactionist framework too broad and general when they are seeking specific theories. Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical framework rather than a theory and can be assessed on the basis of effective conceptualizations. The theoretical framework, as with any theoretical framework, is vague when it comes to analyzing empirical data or predicting outcomes in social life. As a framework rather than a theory, many scholars find it difficult to use. Interactionism being a framework rather than a theory makes it impossible to test interactionism in the manner that a specific theoretical claim about the relationship between specific variables in a given context allows. Unlike the symbolic interactionist framework, the many theories derived from symbolic interactionism, such as role theory and the versions of identity theory developed by Sheldon Stryker, as well as Peter Burke and colleagues, clearly define concepts and the relationships between them in a given context, thus allowing for the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses. Further, especially among Blumerian processual interactionists, a great number of very useful conceptualizations have been developed and applied in a very wide range of social contexts, types of populations, types of behaviors, and cultures and subcultures. Social structure Symbolic interactionism is often related and connected with social structure. This concept suggests that symbolic interactionism is a construction of people's social reality. It also implies that from a realistic point of view, the interpretations that are being made will not make much difference. When the reality of a situation is defined, the situation becomes a meaningful reality. This includes methodological criticisms, and critical sociological issues. A number of symbolic interactionists have addressed these topics, the best known being Stryker's structural symbolic interactionismStryker, Sheldon. 1980. Symbolic Interactionism: A Social Structural Version. Menlo Park, Calif.: Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co. . OCLC 5707030. and the formulations of interactionism heavily influenced by this approach (sometimes referred to as the \\"Indiana School\\" of symbolic interactionism), including the works of key scholars in sociology and psychology using different methods and theories applying a structural version of interactionism that are represented in a 2003 collection edited by Burke et al.Burke, Peter, Timothy J. Owens, Richard T. Serpe, and Peggy A. Thoits. 2003. Advances in Identity Theory and Research. Boston: Springer. . OCLC 853269009. Another well-known structural variation of symbolic interactionism that applies quantitative methods is Manford H. Kuhn's formulation which is often referred to in sociological literature as the \\"Iowa School.\\" Negotiated order theory also applies a structural approach.  Language  Language is viewed as the source of all meaning. Blumer illuminates several key features about social interactionism. Most people interpret things based on assignment and purpose. The interaction occurs once the meaning of something has become identified. This concept of meaning is what starts to construct the framework of social reality. By aligning social reality, Blumer suggests that language is the meaning of interaction. Communication, especially in the form of symbolic interactionism is connected with language. Language initiates all forms of communication, verbal and non- verbal. Blumer defines this source of meaning as a connection that arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.  Critical perspective  According to social theorist Patricia Burbank, the concepts of synergistic and diverging properties are what shape the viewpoints of humans as social beings. These two concepts are different in a sense because of their views of human freedom and their level of focus. According to Burbank, actions are based on the effects of situations that occur during the process of social interaction. Another important factor in meaningful situations is the environment in which the social interaction occurs. The environment influences interaction, which leads to a reference group and connects with perspective, and then concludes to a definition of the situation. This illustrates the proper steps to define a situation. An approval of the action occurs once the situation is defined. An interpretation is then made upon that action, which may ultimately influence the perspective, action, and definition. Stryker emphasizes that the sociology world at large is the most viable and vibrant intellectual framework. By being made up of our thoughts and self-belief, the social interactionism theory is the purpose of all human interaction, and is what causes society to exist. This fuels criticisms of the symbolic interactionist framework for failing to account for social structure, as well as criticisms that interactionist theories cannot be assessed via quantitative methods, and cannot be falsifiable or tested empirically. Framework is important for the symbolic interaction theory because for in order for the social structure to form, there are certain bonds of communication that need to be established to create the interaction. Much of the symbolic interactionist framework's basic tenets can be found in a very wide range of sociological and psychological work, without being explicitly cited as interactionist, making the influence of symbolic interactionism difficult to recognize given this general acceptance of its assumptions as \\"common knowledge.\\" Another problem with this model is two-fold, in that it 1) does not take into account human emotions very much, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely psychological; and 2) is interested in social structure to a limited extent, implying that symbolic interaction is not completely sociological. These incompetencies frame meaning as something that occurs naturally within an interaction under a certain condition, rather than taking into account the basic social context in which interaction is positioned. From this view, meaning has no source and does not perceive a social reality beyond what humans create with their own interpretations.Aksan, Nilgun, Buket Kisac, Mufit Aydin, and Sumeyra Demirbuken. 2009. \\"Symbolic Interaction Theory.\\" Procedia ‚Äì Social and Behavioral Sciences 1(1): 902‚Äì4. DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2009.01.160. Another criticism of symbolic interactionism is more so on the scholars themselves. They are noted to not take interest in the history of this sociological approach. This has the ability to produce shallow understanding and can make the subject \\"hard to teach\\" based on the lack of organization in its teachings to relate with other theories or studies. Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction The Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction (SSSI) is an international professional organization for scholars, who are interested in the study of symbolic interaction. SSSI holds a conference in conjunction with the meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA) and the Society for the Study of Social Problems. This conference typically occurs in August and sponsors the SSSI holds the Couch-Stone Symposium each spring. The Society provides travel scholarships for student members interested in attending the annual conference. At the annual conference, the SSSI sponsors yearly awards in different categories of symbolic interaction. Additionally, some of the awards are open to student members of the society. The Ellis-Bochner Autoethnography and Personal Narrative Research Award is given annually by the SSSI affiliate of the National Communication Association for the best article, essay, or book chapter in autoethnography and personal narrative research. The award is named after renowned autoethnographers Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner. The society also sponsors a quarterly journal, Symbolic Interaction, and releases a newsletter, SSSI Notes. SSSI also has a European branch, which organizes an annual conference that integrates European symbolic interactionists.

The Old Norse term is attested in both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, in the sagas of Icelanders, skaldic poetry, and with its Old English cognate in Beowulf. The word is also reflected in various place names (in English placenames as harrow), often in connection with Germanic deities. Etymology Old Norse h«´rgr means \\"altar, sanctuary\\"; Old English hearg \\"holy grove; temple, idol\\"Simek (2007:156).; and Old High German harug continues a Proto-Germanic *harugaz, possibly cognate with Insular Celtic carrac \\"cliff\\".Gerhard K√∂bler, Germanisches W√∂rterbuch, 5th ed.

In a stanza early in the poem V√∂lusp√°, the v√∂lva says that early in the mythological timeline, the gods met together at the location of I√∞av√∂llr and constructed a h√∂rgr and a hof (Henry Adams Bellows and Ursula Dronke here gloss h√∂rgr as \\"temples\\"): > {  :Old Norse: :Hittoz √¶sir √° I√∞avelli, :√æeir er h«´rg ok hof > h√°timbro√∞o.Dronke (1997:8).  :Henry Adams Bellows translation: :At Ithavoll > met the mighty gods; :Shrines and temples they timbered high;Bellows > (1936:5).  :Ursula Dronke translation: :√Üsir met on Eddying Plain :they who > built towering altars and temples.  } In the poem Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l Gagnr√°√∞r (the god Odin in disguise) engages in a game of wits with the j√∂tunn Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir. Gagnr√°√∞r asks Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir whence the Van god Nj√∂r√∞r came, for though he rules over many hofs and h√∂rgar, Nj√∂r√∞r was not raised among the √Üsir (Benjamin Thorpe here glosses h√∂rgr with \\"offer- steads\\" and Bellows glosses with \\"shrines\\"): > {  Benjamin Thorpe translation: :Tell me tenthly, since thou all the > origin :of the gods knowest, Vafthrudnir! :whence Ni√∂rd came among the > √Üsir's sons? :O'er fanes and offer-steads he rules by hundreds, :yet he was > not among the √Üsir born.Thorpe (1866:16).

Freyja details that the h√∂rgr is constructed of a heap of stones, and that √ìttar very commonly reddened these stones with sacrificial blood (Thorpe glosses h√∂rgr with \\"offer-stead\\", Bellows with \\"shrine\\", and Orchard with \\"altar\\"): > {  :Benjamin Thorpe translation: :An offer-stead to me he raised, :with > stones constructed; :now is the stone :as glass become. :With the blood of > oxen :he newly sprinkled it. :Ottar ever trusted the Asyniur.Thorpe > (1866:108).  :Henry Adams Bellows translation: :For me a shrine of stones > he made, :And now to glass the rock has grown; :Oft with the blood of beasts > was it red; :In the goddesses ever did Ottar trust.Bellows (1936:221).  > :Andy Orchard translation: :He made me a high altar :of heaped-up stones: > :the gathered rocks :have grown all bloody, :and he reddened them again > :with the fresh blood of cows; :Ottar has always :had faith in the > √°synjur.Orchard (1997:89).  } Epigraphic The place name Salh√∏gum, that is mentioned on a 9th-century Danish runestone known as the Snoldelev Stone, has a literal translation which combines Old Norse sal meaning \\"hall\\" with h√∂rgar \\"mounds,\\" to form \\"on the hall mounds,\\" suggesting a place with a room where official meetings took place.Sundqvist (2009:660-661) The inscription states that the man Gunnvaldr is the √æulaR of Salh√∏gum, which has been identified as referring to the modern town Sall√∏v, located in the vicinity of the original site of the runestone.Peterson (2002). Toponymy Many place names in Iceland and Scandinavia contain the word h√∂rgr or h√∂rgur, such as H√∂rg√° and H√∂rgsdalur in Iceland and Harg in Sweden. When Willibrord Christianized the Netherlands (~700 AD) the church of Vlaardingen had a dependency in Harago/Hargan, currently named Harga. This indicates that near those places there was some kind of religious building in medieval times.Kvaran (2006). Old English tradition In the interpretation of Wilson, Anglo-Saxon Paganism (1992), hearg refers to \\"a special type of religious site, one that occupied a prominent position on high land and was a communal place of worship for a specific group of people, a tribe or folk group, perhaps at particular times of the year\\", while a weoh, by contrast, was merely a small shrine by the wayside. Beowulf has the compound h√¶rgtrafum in the so-called \\"Christian excursus\\" (lines 175-178a), translated as \\"tabernacles of idols\\" by Hall (1950). Yasuharu Eto, \\"Hearg and weoh in Beowulf, ll. 175-8a\\" The Bulletin of the Japanese Association for Studies in the History of the English Language, 2007, 15-7. Following the regular evolution of English phonology, Old English hearg has become harrow in modern English placenames (unrelated to the homophone harrow \\"agricultural implement\\"). The London Borough of Harrow derives its name from a temple on Harrow Hill, where St. Mary's Church stands today. The name of Harrow on the Hill (Harewe atte Hulle) was adopted into Latin as Herga super montem; the Latinized form of the Old English name is preserved in the name of Herga Road in Harrow.Briggs, Keith \\"Harrow\\", Journal of the English Place-name Society, volume 42 (2010), 43-64Room, Adrian: ‚ÄúDictionary of Place-Names in the British Isles‚Äù, Bloomsbury, 1988.

He began his career in the mid-1980s as one half of the group Kool G Rap & DJ Polo and as a member of the Juice Crew. He is often cited as one of the most influential and skilled MCs of all time,Kool Moe Dee, 2003, There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, p.225, 228.Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 213-214.Reviews / Music : Top 5 Dead or Alive: Rah Digga Online excerpt from 2004's The New Rolling Stone Album Guide. and a pioneer of mafioso rap/street/hardcore contentCobb, William Jelani, 2007, To The Break of Dawn: A Freestyle On The Hip Hop Aesthetic, NYU Press, p. 59.Hess, Mickey, 2007, Icons Of Hip Hop, Greenwood Publishing Group, p.57.Kool Moe Dee, 2003, There's A God On The Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, p.228. and multisyllabic rhyming.Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 213. On his album The Giancana Story, he stated that the \\"G\\" in his name stands for \\"Giancana\\" (after the mobster Sam Giancana), but on other occasions he has stated that it stands for \\"Genius\\". He has also been cited as a major influence to some of hip-hop's most critically acclaimed figures such as The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Eminem and Jay-Z, as well as many underground rappers.Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. viii, 88, 324. Biography Early years Wilson grew up in the poverty-ridden streets of Corona, Queens, New York with legendary producer Eric B.Kool G Rap, Will C., 2008, Road to the Riches Remaster Liner Notes, p. 4. In an interview with The Source he stated; Around this time, Wilson was looking for a DJ, and through Eric B., he met DJ Polo, who was looking for an MC to collaborate with. Kool G Rap and DJ Polo Juice Crew producer Mr. Magic and DJ Marley Marl allowed Polo and Kool G Rap to go to their studio to record a demo, which resulted in the song \\"It's a Demo.\\" The song was written and recorded in one night, and had Marley so impressed, that he instantly embraced Kool G Rap and DJ Polo as Juice Crew members.Kool G Rap, Will C., 2008, Road to the Riches Remaster Liner Notes, p. 3. In 1986, the duo appeared on Mr. Magic's Rap Attack radio show on 107.5. They eventually released \\"It's a Demo\\" as a single with \\"I'm Fly\\", along with two more singles. Shortly after this, Kool G Rap appeared on the Juice Crew's classic posse cut \\"The Symphony\\" before they released their debut album, Road to the Riches in 1989.[ allmusic ((( Kool G Rap > Biography )))] This album and their two later albums, Wanted: Dead or Alive (1990) and Live and Let Die (1992), are highly regarded and considered hip-hop classics. Eventually, in 1993, Kool G Rap parted ways with DJ Polo to pursue a solo career. Solo career In 1995, Wilson started his solo career with the album 4, 5, 6, which featured production from Buckwild, and guest appearances from Nas, MF Grimm and B-1. It has been his most commercially successful record, reaching No. 24 on the US Billboard 200 album chart. This was followed by Roots of Evil in 1998. In 1997 G Rap was featured on Frankie Cutlass' \\"Politic & Bullsht\\" album track titled \\"Know Da Game\\" which also featured Mobb Deep. He then planned to release his next album, The Giancana Story, on Rawkus Records in 2000. Due to several complications with the record label, the album release date was pushed back several times, and the album was eventually released in 2002. \\"My Life\\", the single from the album, featuring Talk Box legend G-Wise, reached No. 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 Rap singles charts. Kool G Rap and his group 5 Family Click then released a joint album, Click of Respect, on Kool G Rap's own Igloo Ent. record label in 2003, to mild success. There were rumors of Kool G Rap's signing to both Rocafella and G-Unit Records, and at one point Maybach Music. In 2007, he released Half a Klip on Chinga Chang Records, featuring production from, among others, DJ Premier and Marley Marl. A full LP was released in 2011, Riches, Royalty, Respect showcasing his true to form style and lyricism. The promise and prospects of collaboration albums were announced later the next year on his own, newly formed label FullMettle. The first of these new projects came in 2018 with the album Son of G Rap with Rochester, New York based rapper 38 Spesh. In later years, Kool G Rap's interests extended outside hip-hop. He stated in further interviews his desire to begin writing movie scripts, an ambition taken in for a few years as he sought out various collaborators, and as well as his desire to work on a clothing line at one point. Legacy Kool G Rap is regarded as a hugely influential golden age rapper. Music journalist Peter Shapiro suggests that he \\"created the blueprint for Nas, Biggie and everyone who followed in their path\\".Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 214. Kool G is described by Kool Moe Dee as \\"the progenitor and prototype for Biggie, Jay-Z, Treach, N.O.R.E., Fat Joe, Big Pun, and about twenty-five more hard-core emcees\\", and Kool Moe Dee also claims Kool G Rap is \\"the most lyrical\\" out of all of the artists mentioned.Kool Moe Dee, 2003, There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, p.225. MTV describes Kool G Rap as a \\"hip-hop godfather\\", adding that he paved the way for a lot of MCs who we would not have heard of otherwise. Rolling Stone says, \\"G Rap excelled at the street narrative, a style that would come to define later Queens MCs like Nas (who was hugely influenced by G Rap on his early records) and Mobb Deep\\".

He is also often very highly rated in terms of his technical ability and is often ranked alongside other highly regarded golden age MCs, such as Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, and KRS-One. In Jay-Z's track 'Encore', Jay-Z raps, \\"hearing me rap is like hearing G Rap in his prime\\".Jay-Z, 2003, 'Encore', The Black Album, Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam. Allmusic calls him \\"one of the greatest rappers ever\\", \\"a master\\", and \\"a legend\\". A number of rappers, such as Ice Cube, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Lloyd Banks, and Nas have put him in their lists of favorite rappers. Kool Moe Dee ranked Kool G Rap at No. 14 in his book There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, and MTV gives him an 'Honorable Mention' in their Greatest MCs of All Time list. Rhyme technique Kool G Rap is known for using complex multisyllabic rhymes since his debut, and this remains a hallmark of his style, along with his rapid-fire delivery and \\"superhuman breath control\\". He is known for rapping with as many multisyllabic rhymes as possible,Kool Moe Dee, 2003, There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, p.225-228.Sway & King Tech, 1999, 'The Anthem', This Or That, Interscope Records. sometimes all in the same rhyme scheme for a whole verse, such as on Sway & King Tech's 'The Anthem'. He has also been cited as one of hip-hop's greatest storytellers, alongside Slick Rick and Notorious B.I.G.,Kool Moe Dee, 2003, There's A God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, p.225, 227. with \\"laser-like visual descriptions\\", and \\"vivid narratives\\".

Mafioso rap Kool G Rap is often credited as the first rapper to infuse his lyrics with mafioso and hardcore street content. This can be seen as early as 1989 in the song \\"Road to the Riches\\" where he makes a reference to Al Pacino ( who played Michael Corleone in The Godfather and mobster Tony Montana in the 1983 crime drama movie Scarface)Kool G Rap, 1989, 'Road to the Riches', Road to the Riches, Cold Chillin'. ‚Äì this was long before albums such as Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx‚Ä¶ (1995), and Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt (1996) made such references popular. Since his debut, he has used various references to mob movies in his lyrics, album covers, and titles. For example, the first line of 'Bad to the Bone' from Wanted: Dead or Alive (1990) is, I'm bad to the bone / with a style like Al Capone,Kool G Rap, 1990, 'Bad to the Bone', Wanted: Dead or Alive, Cold Chillin'. the album Live and Let Die (1992) uses samples from the 1987 crime film The Untouchables,Kool G Rap, 1992, Live and Let Die, Cold Chillin'. the album cover of Roots of Evil (1998) uses elements from The Godfather and Scarface theatrical posters, and The Giancana Story (2002) album title references Mafia boss Sam Giancana. Rolling Stone says, \\"before Kool G Rap, New York didn't really have the street rap that could hold its own against what artists such as L.A.'s Ice-T and N.W.A were churning out\\" and that \\"G Rap excelled at the street narrative\\". His take on crime, violence, and the mafioso lifestyle ranges from remorse and contemplation (e.g. 'Streets of New York',Kool G Rap, 1990, 'Streets of New York', Wanted: Dead or Alive, Cold Chillin'. described by Rolling Stone as \\"a vivid look inside the misery of the hood\\"), to glorification (e.g. 'Fast Life' featuring NasKool G Rap, 1995, 'Fast Life', 4, 5, 6, Cold Chillin'). Personal life Wilson dated Karrine Steffans from 1995-1999 and they have one son together. He is married to Ma Barker.

They are native to north eastern New South Wales and central and south eastern Queensland. Three species of the genus are commercially important for their fruit, the macadamia nut (or simply macadamia), with a total global production of in 2015. Other names include Queensland nut, bush nut, maroochi nut, bauple nut, and Hawaii nut. In Australian Aboriginal languages, the fruit is known by names such as bauple, gyndl, jindilli, and boombera. It was an important source of bushfood for the Aboriginal peoples who were the original inhabitants of the area. Fresh macadamia nut with husk or pericarp cut in half Macadamia nut in its shell and a roasted nut Macadamia nut with sawn nutshell, and special key used to pry open the nut The nut was first commercially produced on a wide scale in Hawaii, where it was introduced in the 1880s, and for some time they were the world's largest producer. South Africa has been the world's largest producer of the macadamia since the 2010s. Etymology The German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller gave the genus the name Macadamia in 1857 in honour of the Scottish-Australian chemist, medical teacher, and politician John Macadam.Mueller, F.J.H. von (1857) Account of some New Australian Plants.Transactions of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria 2: 72 Type: Macadamia ternifolia F.Muell. Description Macadamia is an evergreen genus that grows tall. The leaves are arranged in whorls of three to six, lanceolate to obovate or elliptic in shape, long and broad, with an entire or spiny- serrated margin. The flowers are produced in a long, slender, simple raceme long, the individual flowers long, white to pink or purple, with four tepals. The fruit is a hard, woody, globose follicle with a pointed apex, containing one or two seeds. The nutshell (\\"coat\\") is particularly tough and requires around 2000 N to crack. The shell material is 5 times harder than hazelnut shells and has mechanical properties similar to aluminum. It has a Vickers hardness of 35. History ;1828 :Allan Cunningham was the first European to encounter the macadamia plant. ;1857 :German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller gave the genus the scientific name Macadamia ‚Äì named after von Mueller‚Äôs friend Dr. John Macadam, a noted scientist and secretary of the Philosophical Institute of Australia. ;1858 :Walter Hill, superintendent of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens (Australia), observed a boy eating the kernel without ill effect, becoming the first nonindigenous person recorded to eat macadamia nuts. ;1860s :King Jacky, aboriginal elder of the Logan River clan, south of Brisbane, Queensland, was the first known macadamia entrepreneur, as his tribe and he regularly collected and traded the macadamias with settlers. ;1866 : Tom Petrie planted macadamias at Yebri Creek (near Petrie) from nuts obtained from Aboriginals at Buderim;(Nut Growing Experiments‚Äô The Queenslander Thursday 8 October 1931 p.13) ;1882 :William H. Purvis introduced macadamia nuts to Hawaii as a windbreak for sugar cane. ;1888 :The first commercial orchard of macadamias was planted at Rous Mill, 12 km from Lismore, New South Wales, by Charles Staff. ;1889 :Joseph Maiden, Australian botanist, wrote, \\"It is well worth extensive cultivation, for the nuts are always eagerly bought.\\"Maiden, J. H., The Useful Native Plants of Australia, 1889, p40 ;1910 :The Hawaiian Agricultural Experiment Station encouraged planting of macadamias on Hawaii's Kona District, as a crop to supplement coffee production in the region.Rieger, M., Introduction to Fruit Crops, 2006, p. 260. ;1916 :Tom Petrie begins trial macadamia plantations in Maryborough, Queensland, combining macadamias with pecans to shelter the trees. ;1922 :Ernest Van Tassel formed the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut Co in Hawaii. ;1925 :Tassel leased on Round Top in Honolulu and began Nutridge, Hawaii's first macadamia seed farm. ;1931 :Tassel established a macadamia-processing factory on Puhukaina Street in Kakaako, Hawaii, selling the nuts as Van's Macadamia Nuts. ;1937 :Winston Jones and J. H. Beaumont of the University of Hawaii's Agricultural Experiment Station reported the first successful grafting of macadamias, paving the way for mass production. ;1940s :Steve Angus, Murwillumbah, Australia, formed Macadamia Nuts Pty Ltd, doing small-scale nut processing. ;1946 :A large plantation was established in Hawaii.Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Packaging ;1953 :Castle & Cooke added a new brand of macadamia nuts called \\"Royal Hawaiian\\", which was credited with popularizing the nuts in the U.S. ;1997 :Australia surpassed the United States as the major producer of macadamias. ;2012‚Äì15 :South Africa surpassed Australia as the largest producer of macadamias. ;2014 :The way that macadamia nuts were served one day on Korean Air Flight 86 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City led to an infamous \\"nut rage incident\\", which gave the nuts high visibility in the South Korean economy and marked a sharp increase in consumption there. Species * Macadamia integrifolia * Macadamia jansenii * Macadamia ternifolia * Macadamia tetraphylla Nuts from M. jansenii contain toxic amounts of cyanogenic glycosides, the other three species are cultivated in the commercial production of macadamia nuts for human consumption. Previously, more species with disjunct distributions were named as members of this genus Macadamia. Genetics and morphological studies published in 2008 show they have separated from the genus Macadamia, correlating less closely than thought from earlier morphological studies. The species previously named in the genus Macadamia may still be referred to overall by the descriptive, non-scientific name of macadamia. ;Formerly included in the genus: ;Lasjia , formerly Macadamia until 2008 * Lasjia claudiensis ; synonym, base name: Macadamia claudiensis * Lasjia erecta ; synonym, base name: Macadamia erecta * Lasjia grandis ; synonym, base name: Macadamia grandis * Lasjia hildebrandii ; synonym, base name: Macadamia hildebrandii * Lasjia whelanii ; synonyms: base name: Helicia whelanii , Macadamia whelanii ;Catalepidia , formerly Macadamia until 1995 *Catalepidia heyana ; synonyms: base name: Helicia heyana , Macadamia heyana ;Virotia , formerly Macadamia until the first species renaming began in 1975 and comprehensive in 2008 *Virotia angustifolia ; synonym, base name: Macadamia angustifolia *Virotia francii ; synonym, base name: Roupala francii *Virotia leptophylla (1975 type species); synonym, base name: Kermadecia leptophylla *Virotia neurophylla ; synonyms: base name: Kermadecia neurophylla , Macadamia neurophylla *Virotia rousselii ; synonym, base name: Roupala rousselii *Virotia vieillardi ; synonym, base name: Roupala vieillardii Cultivation Macadamia integrifolia flowers Three of the four species‚ÄîMacadamia integrifolia, Macadamia ternifolia, and Macadamia tetraphylla‚Äîare of commercial importance. The other species, M. jansenii, produces poisonous nuts resulting from toxic amounts of cyanogenic glycosides. The macadamia tree is usually propagated by grafting, and does not begin to produce commercial quantities of seeds until it is 7‚Äì10 years old, but once established, may continue bearing for over 100 years. Macadamias prefer fertile, well-drained soils, a rainfall of , and temperatures not falling below (although once established, they can withstand light frosts), with an optimum temperature of . The roots are shallow and trees can be blown down in storms; like most Proteaceae, they are also susceptible to Phytophthora root disease. As of 2019, the macadamia nut is the most expensive nut in the world, which is attributed to the slow harvesting process. Macadamia 'Beaumont' in new growth Cultivars Beaumont A Macadamia integrifolia / M. tetraphylla hybrid commercial variety is widely planted in Australia and New Zealand; it was discovered by Dr. J. H. Beaumont. It is high in oil, but is not sweet. New leaves are reddish, and flowers are bright pink, borne on long racemes. It is one of the quickest varieties to come into bearing once planted in the garden, usually carrying a useful crop by the fourth year, and improving from then on. It crops prodigiously when well pollinated. The impressive, grape-like clusters are sometimes so heavy, they break the branchlets to which they are attached. In commercial orchards, it has reached per tree by eight years old. On the downside, the macadamias do not drop from the tree when ripe, and the leaves are a bit prickly when one reaches into the interior of the tree during harvest. Its shell is easier to open than that of most commercial varieties. Macadamia 'Maroochy' new growth Maroochy A pure M. tetraphylla variety from Australia, this strain is cultivated for its productive crop yield, flavor, and suitability for pollinating 'Beaumont'. Nelmac II A South African M. integrifolia / M. tetraphylla hybrid cultivar, it has a sweet seed, which means it has to be cooked carefully so that the sugars do not caramelise. The sweet seed is usually not fully processed, as it generally does not taste as good, but many people enjoy eating it uncooked. It has an open micropyle (hole in the shell) which may let in mould. The crack-out percentage (ratio of nut meat to whole nut, by weight) is high. Ten-year-old trees average per tree. It is a popular variety because of its pollination of 'Beaumont', and the yields are almost comparable. Renown A M. integrifolia / M. tetraphylla hybrid, this is a rather spreading tree. On the plus side, it is high yielding commercially, from a 9-year-old tree has been recorded, and the nuts drop to the ground. However, they are thick-shelled, with not much flavor. Production In 2018, South Africa was estimated to remain the world's leading producer of macadamia nuts with 54,000 tonnes out of global production of 211,000 tonnes. In 2015, South Africa produced compared to Australia's 40,000 tonnes and the total global production of . Macadamia is also commercially produced in Brazil, United States (California and Hawaii states), Costa Rica, Israel, Kenya, China, Bolivia, New Zealand, Colombia, Guatemala and Malawi. The first commercial orchard of macadamia trees was planted in the early 1880s by Rous Mill, southeast of Lismore, New South Wales, consisting of M. tetraphylla. Besides the development of a small boutique industry in Australia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, macadamia was extensively planted as a commercial crop in Hawaii from the 1920s. Macadamia seeds were first imported into Hawaii in 1882 by William H. Purvis, who planted seeds that year at Kapulena. The Hawaiian-produced macadamia established the well-known seed internationally, and in 2017 Hawaii produced over 22,000 tonnes. In 2019, researchers collected samples from hundreds of trees in Queensland, and compared the genetic profiles to samples from Hawaiian orchards. They determined that essentially all the Hawaiian trees must have descended from a small population of Australian trees from Gympie, possibly just a single tree. This lack of genetic diversity in the commercial crop puts it at risk of succumbing to pathogens (as has happened in the past to banana cultivars). Growers may seek to diversify the cultivated population, by hybridizing with wild specimens. Nuts food and nutrition The seeds (nuts) are a valuable food crop. In a 100-gram amount, macadamia nuts provide 740 Calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of numerous essential nutrients, including thiamine (104% DV), vitamin B6 (21% DV), manganese (195% DV), iron (28% DV), magnesium (37% DV), and phosphorus (27% DV) (table). Macadamia nuts are 76% fat, 14% carbohydrates, including 9% dietary fiber, and 8% protein (table). Compared with other common edible nuts, such as almonds and cashews, macadamias are high in total fat and relatively low in protein (table). They have a high amount of monounsaturated fats (59% of total content, table) and contain, as 17% of total fat, the monounsaturated fat, omega-7 palmitoleic acid. Toxicity in dogs Macadamias are toxic to dogs. Ingestion may result in macadamia toxicity marked by weakness and hind limb paralysis with the inability to stand, occurring within 12 hours of ingestion. Depending on the quantity ingested and size of the dog, symptoms may also include muscle tremors, joint pain, and severe abdominal pain. In high doses of toxin, opiate medication may be required for symptom relief until the toxic effects diminish, with full recovery usually within 24 to 48 hours. Other uses The trees are also grown as ornamental plants in subtropical regions for their glossy foliage and attractive flowers. The flowers produce a well regarded honey. The wood is used decoratively for small items. Macadamia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Batrachedra arenosella. Macadamia seeds are often fed to hyacinth macaws in captivity. These large parrots are one of the few animals, aside from humans, capable of cracking the shell and removing the seed.

Catsuits frequently close by means of a zipper at the front or back. A catsuit is regarded as outerwear, but not normally street wear. History and use Catsuits were occasionally worn as a fashion item at various times from the 1960s to the 1990s. During the 1970s and 1980s, they were worn for aerobics and disco dancing. Around 1980, disco dance catsuits briefly became a street fashion item in the United Kingdom. Athletes in sports such as speed skating, bobsled, winter triathlon, ski-racing, cycling, bodyflight and gymnastics wear garments similar to catsuits, called unitards, which are specifically geared to the needs of the sport involved. Also similar in appearance are wetsuits and drysuits used by scuba divers, and the speedsuits used by competitive swimmers before the more extreme forms of the suit were banned. Also, in tennis Serena Williams would sometimes wear catsuits, two examples are the 2002 US Open and the 2018 French Open. The name \\"catsuit\\" is attributed only since about 1955 or 1960. The origin of the name is unknown; it may refer to a slinky, catlike aspect given the wearer by some versions. In popular culture Actress Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in 1966 The catsuit is often worn in movies, television, music videos, and computer games. * In comics and their movie adaptations, catsuits are often worn by superheroes and supervillains, including the iconic Catwoman; other examples include Batgirl and Black Panther. * Scarlett Johansson wears a catsuit portraying Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in several films, beginning with Iron Man 2 (2010). * The lead female characters of the Underworld film series and The Matrix wore catsuits. * Female villains and heroines in spy films may wear catsuits, such as the Baroness and Scarlett in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. * An iconic use of catsuits in popular media was on the British television show The Avengers, where Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman) and Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) wore tight leather catsuits; leather was chosen because it lit well in studio lighting and did not split during action scenes. * Shirley Bassey wore a sleeveless chiffon catsuit for a gatefold album photograph, and in concert. * Cher has worn catsuits in concert. * In popular culture, catsuits have become the stereotypical costume of dominatrixes. * Lara Croft, heroine of the Tomb Raider franchise, has worn catsuits in specific segments in Tomb Raider 3 and Chronicles. * In the Star Trek: Enterprise TV series, the Vulcan commander T'Pol (portrayed by Jolene Blalock) wore a uniform sometimes described as a catsuit., \\"Without my Vulcan catsuit, Frankenstein wig and pointed ears, I don't get recognized.

It is part of Asimov's Robot series, which consists of many short stories (collected in I, Robot, The Rest of the Robots, The Complete Robot, Robot Dreams, Robot Visions, and Gold) and five novels (including The Positronic Man, The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, and The Robots of Dawn). Robots and Empire is part of Asimov's consolidation of his three major series of science fiction stories and novels: his Robot series, his Galactic Empire series and his Foundation series. (Asimov also carried out this unification in his novel Foundation's Edge, and its sequel, thus unifying the three series of fiction into a single future history). In the novel, Asimov depicts the transition from his earlier Milky Way Galaxy, inhabited by both human beings and positronic robots, to his Galactic Empire. The galaxy of his earlier trilogy of Robot novels is dominated by the blended human/robotic societies of the fifty \\"Spacer\\" planets, dispersed over a wide part of the Galaxy. While the Earth is much more populous than all of the Spacer planets combined, its people are looked down upon and treated almost as sub-human by the Spacers. For a long time, the Spacers have forbidden immigration of people from the Earth. But Asimov's later Galactic Empire is populated by many quadrillions of human beings on hundreds of thousands of habitable planets, and by very few robots (such as R. Daneel Olivaw). Even the technology to maintain and upgrade robots exists on only a few out-of-the-way planets. Therefore, Asimov's novel attempts to describe how his earlier Robot series ultimately connects to his Galactic Empire series. Plot summary The Earthman Elijah Baley (the detective hero of the previous Robot books) has died nearly two centuries earlier. During these two centuries, Earth-people have overcome their agoraphobia and resumed space colonization, using faster- than-light drive to reach distant planets beyond the earlier \\"Spacer\\" worlds. Their inhabitants, calling themselves \\"Settlers\\" rather than \\"Spacers\\", revere Earth as their mother-world. Baley's memory remains in the mind of his former lover, Gladia Delmarre, a long-lived \\"Spacer\\" who uncharacteristically relocated from the spacer world of Solaria to Aurora. Gladia's homeworld and the 50th-established of the Spacer planets, Solaria, has become empty of all human inhabitants, although millions of robot servants remain. A seventh- generation descendant of Baley's, Daneel Giskard ('D.G.') Baley, gains Gladia's help in visiting Solaria, to investigate the destruction of several \\"Settler\\" spaceships that made landings there, and to capture the presumably unsupervised robots. Gladia is accompanied by the positronic robots R. Daneel Olivaw and R. Giskard Reventlov, both the former property of their creator, Dr. Han Fastolfe, who bequeathed them to Gladia in his will. R. Giskard has secret telepathic powers of which only R. Daneel knows. At the same time, Daneel and Giskard are engaged in a struggle of wits with Fastolfe's rivals: The roboticists Kelden Amadiro and Vasilia Aliena, Fastolfe's estranged daughter. Frustrated by his series of failures, Amadiro accepts an ambitious and unscrupulous apprentice, Levular Mandamus, who plans to destroy the population of the Earth by a newly developed weapon, the \\"nuclear intensifier\\", with which to accelerate the natural radioactive decay in the upper crust of the Earth, thereby making the surface of the Earth radioactive. R. Daneel and R. Giskard discover the roboticists' plan, and attempt to stop Amadiro; but are hampered by the First Law of Robotics, which prevents them from a direct attack on Amadiro. Daneel and Giskard, meanwhile, have inferred an additional Zeroth Law of Robotics: which might enable them to overcome Amadiro, if they can use their telepathic perception of humanity to quell the inhibitions of the first law. When Vasilia accuses Giskard of telepathy (earlier created by herself) Giskard is compelled to manipulate her mind to make her forget about his telepathic powers. The two robots locate Amadiro and Mandamus on Earth, at the site of Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. After Amadiro admits their plans, Giskard alters Amadiro's brain (using the newly created Zeroth Law); but in so doing, threatens his own. Now alone with the robots, Mandamus claims that his intentions were to draw out the radioactive catastrophe over many decades, rather than the mere years that Amadiro wanted, and Giskard, believing it best for humanity to abandon the Earth, allows Mandamus to do this (resulting in the situation depicted by Pebble in the Sky), and deprives Mandamus of the memory of doing so. Giskard predicts, correctly, that by forcing humanity into leaving the Earth, vigor will be reintroduced into mankind and the new Settlers will populate space until all the governments of the interstellar colonies form a \\"Galactic Empire\\". Under the stress of changing the course of humanity (against First and Zeroth Laws), R. Giskard himself suffers a soon-fatal malfunction of his positronic brain and confers his telepathic ability upon R. Daneel. Novel In his memoir I. Asimov (1994), Asimov explained that following his commercial and critical success with The Robots of Dawn, he decided to write Robots and Empire with the intentions of making Daneel \\"the real hero of the series\\", the novel's protagonist; and that Robots and Empire would create a bridge to the later volumes of his future history. About this second aim, Asimov said that he was persuaded against it by Lester del Rey and Judy-Lynn del Rey, his long-time friends and the editors of Del Rey Books, who thought that the fans of Asimov's series of novels would rather that Asimov kept the Robot and Empire/Foundation universes separate. On the other hand, his editors at Doubleday Books - his hardcover book publisher - encouraged Asimov to do what deep-down he wanted to do. From then on, Asimov proceeded with his plans for unifying the two series. Asimov wrote Robots and Empire in a nonlinear fashion (other examples of nonlinear plot-structuring in Asimov's novels can be found in The Gods Themselves and Nemesis). Flashbacks by the major characters alternate with the present-time storyline. The story starts on the Spacer planet Aurora, where the heart of Amadiro's conspiracy against Settler civilization is developing. Meanwhile, aboard a starship, Gladia, Daneel, and Giskard visit the planets Solaria and Baleyworld before reaching the Earth, where this novel's climax takes place. Asimov used this planet-hopping itinerary most notably in most of the volumes of the Foundation series from Foundation and Empire onward. Unlike the detective fiction methods of the previous Robot novels where Baley assembles the clues to a crime that had been committed, in Robots and Empire, a murderous conspiracy developing against the Earth, and its discovery by the robots, keep pace with each other right up through the final confrontation with Amadiro on the Earth. Then, the robots have only moments to spare in terminating Amadiro's evil plan for a quick death to all Earthlings. As well as linking the two series into a single future history, the present book served to address a criticism levelled against the largely radioactive Earth as depicted in Pebble in the Sky and mentioned in several other books. Though not explicitly stated, there was the clear implication the world being mostly radioactive and humans precariously surviving in the uncontaminated areas in between was the result of a nuclear war hundreds or thousands of years before the time of the plot. This would have made Pebble in the Sky part of the post-nuclear war subgenre common in the 1950s. It was, however, pointed out by critics that such an extensive use of nuclear weapons as to leave persistent and widespread radiation even after centuries would have completely destroyed all life on Earth at the moment when it took place. Therefore, in the present book Asimov provided a different origin for the future Earth's radioactivity. Reception Dave Langford reviewed Robots and Empire for White Dwarf #85, and stated that \\"Asimov always perks up when chopping logic with the Three Laws of Robotics, and here his robots come up with a Fourth, or rather Zeroth, Law. This works out approximately as 'the end justifies the means'. For some reason the author doesn't even seem mildly worried by the implications...\\" References External links * * * Robots and Empire at Worlds Without End Category:1985 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Foundation universe books Category:Science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:Nonlinear narrative novels ","title":"Robots and Empire"},{"id":"309409","text":"Foundation is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is the first published in his Foundation Trilogy (later expanded into the Foundation Series). Foundation is a cycle of five interrelated short stories, first published as a single book by Gnome Press in 1951. Collectively they tell the early story of the Foundation, an institute founded by psychohistorian Hari Seldon to preserve the best of galactic civilization after the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Origin and early publication history Four of the five stories had been earlier published in Astounding Science Fiction between 1942 and 1944 under different titles. A fifth part, the first in terms of fictional chronology, was added for the 1951 Gnome Press edition. The original four stories also appeared in 1955 as part of Ace Double's novel series as D-110 under the title The 1,000-Year Plan. Two further books, each consisting of two novellas, were published shortly after and the three are considered a trilogy. Asimov would write two further sequel novels and two prequels. Later writers have written new additions authorized by Asimov's estate. The Foundation Series is often regarded as one of Isaac Asimov's best works, alongside his Robot series, which takes place in the same universe. Background On 1 August 1941 Isaac Asimov proposed to John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction that he write a short story set in a slowly declining Galactic Empire, based on the fall of the Roman Empire. Campbell liked the idea, and by the end of a two-hour meeting Asimov planned to write a series of stories depicting the fall of the first Galactic Empire and the rise of the second. Asimov submitted the first \\"Foundation\\" story on 8 September, Campbell purchased it on 15 September, and Astounding published it in May 1942. Asimov wrote seven more stories over eight years, and they were collected into The Foundation Trilogy. Published from 1951 to 1953, the three books became Asimov's most popular science fiction and won a Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966. Plot summary \\"The Psychohistorians\\" This part is original to the 1951 book version and takes place in 0 F.E. (\\"Foundation Era\\"). The story begins on Trantor, the capital of the 12,000-year-old Galactic Empire, a powerful but slowly decaying empire. Hari Seldon, a mathematician and psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that equates all possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing for the prediction of future events. By means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the declining nature of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Committee of Public Safety, the de facto rulers of the Empire. The Committee considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with young mathematician Gaal Dornick, who has arrived on Trantor to meet Seldon. Seldon is tried by the Committee and defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 300 years and enter a 30,000-year dark age. He informs the Committee that an alternative to this future is attainable, and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, would not avert the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium. The skeptical Committee, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus, with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia. He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \\"Encyclopedists\\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that despite the Empire believing they won by exiling Seldon the outcome was exactly what he had hoped would happen. Terminus would be the home of the first Foundation while a second would be established \\"at Star's End.\\" Seldon further announces he's dying and implores Dornick to become a leader in the new Foundation. \\"The Encyclopedists\\" \\"The Encyclopedists\\" was originally published in the May, 1942 issue of Astounding Science-Fiction under the title of \\"Foundation\\". The story begins in 50 F.E. on Terminus, which has almost no mineral resources. There is one region suitable for the development of a large city, named Terminus City. The colony of professionals, devoted to the creation of the Encyclopedia Galactica, is managed by the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Galactica Foundation, composed solely of scientists, called the Encyclopedists. The affairs of Terminus City itself are handled by the city's first Mayor, Salvor Hardin, who is a political figurehead and virtually powerless due to the influence of the Board of Trustees. However, Hardin refuses to accept the status quo, which he believes puts Terminus in danger of political exploitation by the four neighboring prefectures of the Empire, which have declared independence and severed contact with its capital, Trantor, and are now calling themselves \\"The Four Kingdoms.\\" Hardin manages to avoid an attempt by the Kingdom of Anacreon to establish military bases on Terminus and to take advantage of their nuclear power, which Terminus retains but which the Four Kingdoms do not. Hardin succeeds in diverting Anacreon from its initial goal and furthers his goal of the establishment of a stable political system on Terminus. Hardin's efforts are still resisted by the Board of Trustees and its chairman, Dr. Lewis Pirenne, who erroneously believe they are protected by imperial decree. To remove this obstacle, Hardin and his chief advisor, Yohan Lee, plan a \\"coup d'√©tat\\" designed to remove the Board of Trustees from its politically powerful position on the same day that, in the city's Time Vault, a holographic recording of Hari Seldon is programmed to play. The recording will contain psychohistoric proof of Hardin's success or failure; Hardin realizes that his coup is a great gamble due to the possible case that his beliefs are incompatible with Seldon's original goals. The next day in the Time Vault the holographic video of Hari Seldon in his wheelchair appears. He reveals that the Encyclopedia Galactica is actually a distraction intended to make the colony's creation possible. The true purpose of the Foundation is to form one nucleus of a Second Galactic Empire and shorten the predicted period of chaos to a mere thousand years, rather than thirty thousand years. After the video ends, the Encyclopedists admit, to Hardin, to having been wrong, and Pirenne schedules a meeting to discuss their next action. Hardin knew that this victory would give him the leverage he needed to gain significant power and thus \\"assume actual government\\" by removing the \\"figurehead\\" status from his Mayoral office. He also knew that Anacreon's forces would be arriving soon to forcibly take the Foundation. Salvor Hardin had guessed the solution, and as Hari Seldon said, \\"it was obvious.\\" \\"The Mayors\\" \\"The Mayors\\" was originally published in the June 1942 issue of Astounding Science-Fiction as \\"Bridle and Saddle\\" (referring to Aesop's fable \\"The Horse that Lost its Liberty\\", a variant of which is recited by Hardin during the climax of the story). By 80 F.E., the Foundation's scientific understanding has given it significant leverage over the Four Kingdoms, though it is still isolated from the Galactic Empire. Exercising its control over the region through an artificial religion, Scientism, the Foundation shares its technology with the Four Kingdoms while referring to it as religious truth. Maintenance technicians comprise Scientism's priesthood, trained on Terminus. A majority of the priests themselves are unaware of the true importance of their \\"religion,\\" referring to advanced technology as \\"holy\\" artifacts and tools. The religion is not suppressed by the secular elite of the Four Kingdoms, reminiscent of Western European rulers of the early medieval period, who use it to consolidate their power over the zealous populaces. Salvor Hardin, as Mayor of Terminus City, is the effective ruler of the Foundation, and has been reelected as mayor continuously since his political victory over the Encyclopedia Galactica Board of Trustees. However, his influence is suddenly checked by a new political movement led by city councillor Sef Sermak, which encourages direct action against the Four Kingdoms and a cessation of the scientific proselytizing encouraged by Hardin's administration. The movement, which calls itself \\"The Actionist Party\\" and whose followers refer to themselves as Actionists, is wildly popular, and Sermak and his fellow Actionist leaders refuse to respond to Hardin's efforts to appease them. The kingdom that is most concerning to the Actionists is that of Anacreon, ruled by Prince Regent Wienis and his nephew, the teenaged King Lepold I. Wienis plans to overthrow the Foundation's power by launching a direct military assault against Terminus, making use of an abandoned Imperial battlecruiser redesigned by Foundation experts to fit the needs of the elite Anacreonian navy. However, Hardin orders a few minor modifications to be incorporated into the ship's design prior to its completion. Wienis plans to launch his offensive on the night of his nephew's coronation as king and sole ruler of Anacreon. Hardin attends the coronation ceremony and is arrested, but he has already arranged with Anacreonian High Priest Poly Verisof, who is aware of the true nature of Scientism and is also Terminus's Ambassador to Anacreon, to foster a popular uprising against Wienis. Convincing the Anacreonian populace that an assault against the Foundation and Terminus is blasphemous, Verisof leads an infuriated mob to the royal palace and surrounds it, demanding Hardin's release. Meanwhile, one of Hardin's modifications to the battlecruiser shows itself; an ultrawave relay, a remote kill-switch to the ship's systems. The priest-attendant of the ship, Theo Aporat, presents the relay's activation as a divine curse, and the crew, convinced of the Foundation's god's power, mutinies against its commander, Admiral Prince Lefkin, Wienis's son. Lefkin confronts the mutineers and, captured, is forced to broadcast a message to Anacreon demanding Wienis's arrest and threatening a bombardment of the royal palace if that and other demands are not met. Wienis, maddened by his failure, orders Hardin's execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. Attempting and failing, due to a protective energy field, to kill Hardin personally, Wienis dies by suicide. Hardin is proven correct again upon his return to Terminus City by another Seldon recording, set to play at this date. Though Actionists continue to hold a significant amount of power, enough now to control the City Council, an attempt to impeach the Mayor has already failed, and his popularity is renewed among the city's residents. It is also confirmed by Hari Seldon that the Foundation's immediate neighbors, the Four Kingdoms, will now be virtually powerless and incapable of resisting Scientism's advance. However, the growing nationalism of the fractured Periphery makes it hard for religion to make further conquests. \\"The Traders\\" \\"The Traders\\" was originally published in the October 1944 issue of Astounding Science-Fiction as \\"The Wedge\\". Circa 135 F.E., the Foundation has expanded and has sent out officially sanctioned Traders to exchange technology with neighboring planets for what amounts to greater political and economic power. Master Trader Eskel Gorov, also an agent of the Foundation government, has travelled to the worlds of Askone, where he hopes to trade atomics. Gorov, however, is met with resistance by Askone's governing Elders due to traditional taboos that effectively ban advanced technology. Gorov is imprisoned and sentenced to death; the Elders refuse Foundation requests for clemency. Trader Linmar Ponyets is ordered by the Foundation to try to negotiate with the Elders, and travels to the central Askonian planet. Ponyets meets with the Elders' Grand Master and deduces that, though he is determined to have Gorov executed, he may be willing to exchange the captive for a suitable bribe, which Ponyets realizes would be a sum of gold. Ponyets clumsily fashions a transmuter that will convert iron into gold. The Grand Master informs Ponyets that others who have attempted this have failed and have been punished with execution for both their attempt and for their failure; Ponyets succeeds and convinces the Grand Master that the gold is appropriate for Askonian religious decoration, which pleases the Elders. Councilor Pherl, the Grand Master's prot√©g√©, appears to be wary of Ponyets. Meeting with the Councilor, Ponyets discovers that Pherl is instead quite willing to work with him, if only due to the chances of eventually attaining the Grand Mastership himself. Pherl, from a different ethnic background than traditional Grand Masters and a young man, believes that a stable supply of gold will be able to dramatically increase his power, and Ponyets sells him the transmuter. He also plants a video recorder inside, and, once Pherl tries to back out of paying the agreed price, blackmails him with a recording of the transmuter's use. Gorov is released quickly. According to a new agreement, he and Ponyets can take as much tin from Pherl's mines as they can carry. Ponyets discusses his success with Gorov, and explains that now, Pherl is going to become the new Grand Master - and one very much interested in selling Foundation goods, since Ponyets left all his cargo with him, and making people buy it is the only way for Pherl to salvage some of his pride. Gorov criticizes his techniques due to what he perceives as Ponyets's lack of morality. Ponyets replies by reminding Gorov of an alleged statement made by Salvor Hardin: \\"Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!\\" \\"The Merchant Princes\\" \\"The Merchant Princes\\" was first published in the August 1944 issue of Astounding Science-Fiction as \\"The Big and the Little\\") Circa 155 F.E., the powerful Foundation has subjugated the neighboring Four Kingdoms and tries expanding its religious empire. However, due to rumors of the subjugation of the Four Kingdoms and, later, Askone, further expansion faces heavy resistance. Recently, three Foundation vessels have vanished near the planets of the Republic of Korell, thus the nation is suspected of either independent technological development or buying smuggled Foundation goods. Master Trader Hober Mallow is assigned to deal with Korell and also to investigate their technological developments and find the missing ships. Those who have assigned this mission to Mallow, Foreign Secretary Publis Manlio and Mayoral Secretary Jorane Sutt, believe that a Seldon Crisis is underway; they fear that domestic tensions caused by the great autonomy given to Traders and shaky foreign relations may give rise to a nuclear conflict involving the Foundation. Sutt and Manlio, wanting to weaken the Traders and suspecting Mallow of being connected to the smugglers, plant an agent, Jaim Twer, who boasts of a lay education, aboard Mallow's ship, the Far Star. After the Far Star lands on Korell, the crew allows a Foundation missionary aboard the ship, in violation of orders Mallow has given that require his permission before anyone boards or leaves the Far Star. Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries to be on the planet under penalty of death. The crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been captured by the Korellians but escaped before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been let aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor (\\"First Citizen Of The State\\") Asper Argo (after several days of failure at securing such a meeting), indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Foundation missionaries on Korell, which turns out to coincide with Mallow's own interests. Mallow, among other things, offers the Commdor tools for heavy industry, believing that will allow him to visit a factory, where the advanced technology would be found if Korell has it. He sees no signs of it, but does manage to catch a glimpse of the ruler's guards' weapons - atomic handguns bearing the markings of the Galactic Empire, which the Foundation assumes has fallen by this time. Mallow's discoveries lead him to believe that the Empire may be attempting to expand into the Periphery again, and has been providing weapons to client states such as Korell. Leaving the Republic and his ship, he journeys alone to the planet Siwenna, which he believes may be the capital of an Imperial province. He finds Siwenna a desolate and sad place, and meets the now-impoverished former patrician Onum Barr in the latter's isolated mansion, which is slowly crumbling. Barr, a former provincial senator and a leading citizen, had served in the Imperial government on Siwenna during a fairly stable time several decades earlier, before a series of corrupt and ambitious viceroys who each harbored dreams of becoming Emperor. After the previous viceroy rebelled against the Emperor, Barr participated in a revolution that overthrew the viceroy. However, the Imperial fleet also sent to remove the viceroy wanted to conquer a rebellious province even if it was no longer in rebellion, and began a massacre that claimed the lives of all but one of Barr's children. The new viceroy also plans a rebellion, but keeps a backup plan; fleeing into the Periphery and carving out a sizable realm there. He had secured a political alliance with Korell by marrying his daughter to Asper. Mallow manages to tour a Siwennian power plant. He observes that the technicians can only maintain the plants, but cannot repair them. He also notes the nuclear generators are much bigger than those of Terminus. Both mean that the Empire cannot replace the goods Mallow sells to the Commdor. He also realizes that religion cannot make further conquests for the Foundation, but a commercial empire can. Mallow is tried for murder approximately one year after his return to Terminus, due to turning over the Foundation missionary to the mob. However, he is able to produce a recording revealing to the court that the \\"missionary\\" was in fact a Korellian secret policeman. Acquitted, Mallow is received with delight by the population of Terminus, which (along with the wealth obtained by trading with Korell) all but ensures him the Mayor's seat in the elections scheduled to take place in the following year. To prepare for the election, Mallow engineers the arrest of Sutt and Manlio, suspecting them (rightly) of intending to engineer a coup with the aid of the Four Kingdoms' religious elements, and eventually takes office. However, he is soon faced with tensions between the Foundation and Korell, which declares war on the Foundation, using its powerful Imperial flotilla to attack Foundation ships. But instead of counterattacking, Mallow takes no action, effectively imposing an embargo on Korell, and waiting until the lack of Foundation goods forces Korell to surrender, which it does. Due to Mallow's control over industry and trade, The Foundation starts to become a Plutocracy. When one of his allies, horrified, asks why Mallow is not building towards a future empire Mallow replies it was only his job to stop the current crisis and history would take care of the ones to come.

Created by writer-artist Jack Kirby, the character first made a cameo in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #134 in November 1970 before officially debuting in Forever People #1 in February 1971. He is the tyrannical ruler of the planet Apokolips whose ultimate goal is to conquer the universe by eliminating all hope and free will in sentient beings. A New God and one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, Darkseid serves as a staple Superman villain and the archenemy of the Justice League. The character was ranked as the 6th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time by IGN and as the 23rd Greatest Villain of All Time by Wizard magazine. Darkseid has been substantially adapted into various forms of media, most notably being voiced by Michael Ironside within the DC animated universe, by Andre Braugher in Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, by Tony Todd in the DC Animated Movie Universe, and as the main antagonist in the final season of Smallville. After being referenced multiple times in the DC Extended Universe, he made his feature film debut in Zack Snyder's Justice League portrayed by Ray Porter through voice and motion capture. Publication history Jack Kirby returned to DC Comics with Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #133 and immediately began establishing characters that would lay the foundation for his newly conceived Fourth World epic. The chief antagonist would be the villain Darkseid who had a cameo in Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #134 (November 1970) with a full first appearance in Forever People #1 (February 1971) . The character was originally designed to be the chief antagonist of the titles Forever People, Mister Miracle and New Gods, but after the cancellation of these titles, he continued to appear as a major villain in many DC Universe comic books, fighting both Superman and Batman. According to writer Mark Evanier, Kirby modelled Darkseid's face on actor Jack Palance, while the villain's personality was inspired by Adolf Hitler and Richard Nixon. Fictional character biography The son of King Yuga Khan and Queen Heggra, Prince Uxas, second in line to the throne of Apokolips, plotted to seize power over the planet. When his brother, Drax, attempted to claim the fabled Omega Force, Uxas murdered him, and took the power for himself. The power transformed him into a rock-like creature, upon which he took the name Darkseid. At some point in time, he fell in love with an Apokoliptian scientist and sorceress named Suli, with whom he had a son, Kalibak; however, Suli was poisoned by Desaad on Heggra's behalf, as she believed that Suli was corrupting her son. Following Suli's death, Darkseid's heart grew even colder, and he ordered Desaad to poison Heggra, and as soon as he did, Darkseid finally became the supreme monarch of Apokolips. Darkseid had briefly been forced by his mother to marry Tigra, with whom he also had a son. After murdering his mother, Darkseid ordered Tigra to eliminate their son, Orion, who was switched with the Highfather's son, Scott Free, so as to keep peace between New Genesis and Apokolips. The destructive war with the rival planet, New Genesis, was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of the sons of Highfather and Darkseid. Darkseid's second born son was surrendered to Highfather, while Darkseid received Scott Free. This eventually turned out to be a setback for Darkseid, with his biological son growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis as a powerful champion in opposition to his father. The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of his son in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips. Likewise, Darkseid and his training minion, Granny Goodness, were unable to break Scott Free's spirit after years of torturous upbringing and the New God was able to escape Apokolips, taking with him the mightiest of the Female Furies, Big Barda, as his wife and came to Earth to become the master escape artist and superhero foe of Darkseid, Mister Miracle. Regardless, Darkseid anticipated that Scott would make such a move and used its occurrence as a pretext to declare the treaty with New Genesis abrogated and resume armed conflict. Seeing other deities as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of Themyscira in order to discover the secret location of the Olympian deities, planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power. Refusing to aid Darkseid in his mad quest, the Amazons battled his Parademon troops, causing half of the Amazon population's death. Wonder Woman was able to gain her revenge against Darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid. This supposedly weakened the god's power as he lost a portion of his dark edge. Darkseid's goal was to eliminate all free will from the universe and reshape it into his own image. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious Anti-Life Equation, which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion Glorious Godfrey, who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in Earth, as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation. Darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many superheroes of the DC Universe, most notably the Kryptonian Superman. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through Intergang, a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of evil. The Great Darkness Saga One thousand years in the future, Darkseid has been absent for centuries and is almost completely forgotten. He returns and comes into conflict with that era's champions, the Legion of Super-Heroes. After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and Daxam‚Äîwhich places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants Kryptonian- like superpowers equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe. However, he is eventually defeated by the Legion and many of its allies.The Great Darkness Saga was removed from mainstream DC continuity in 1994, following the events of the Zero Hour limited series. However, the tale has been restored to continuity in recent years. In Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 6, #4 (October 2010), explicit reference is made to the events of \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\", mentioning (among other things) Darkseid's victory over Mordru on the planet Avalon. Similarly in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 7, #3 (January 2012), a Daxamite official remarked that the people of his world \\"still mourn how Darkseid used us for violence\\". The Seven Soldiers and \\"Boss Dark Side\\" In Grant Morrison's 2005 Mister Miracle limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the Anti-Life Equation, which he then used to destroy the Fourth World altogether. The New Gods fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. Metron used a wheelchair, the Black Racer was an old white man in a wheelchair, DeSaad was an evil psychiatrist, Granny Goodness was a pimp (or \\"madam\\") for the Female Furies and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as \\"Boss Dark Side\\". It is revealed that Darkseid actually gave the Sheeda North America in return for Aurakles, Earth's first superhero. This was, in turn, purely in order for Darkseid to get Shilo Norman, whom he considers the \\"Avatar of Freedom\\", in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the New Gods. Final Crisis As prophesied, Orion returns to Earth via boom tube for his final battle with Darkseid. During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, which created a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having \\"won\\" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as \\"Boss Dark Side\\", aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain Libra. Once again bound to the form of a human, \\"Boss Dark Side\\" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to Final Crisis. In Flash (vol. 2) #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the \\"spoken form\\" of the Anti-Life Equation, to kidnap the Tornado Twins. In Birds of Prey #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by Bernadeth. In Teen Titans #59, it was revealed that he had employed the Terror Titans to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights. In Final Crisis, Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the Multiverse with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and antichrist-like figure who soon converts much of the Secret Society of Super Villains to his cause with the aid of the Crime Bible and the Holy Lance. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as Mary Marvel. Darkseid also arranges for detective Dan Turpin to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's \\"final host\\", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest \\"rebirth\\", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment Shilo Norman, the \\"Embodiment of Freedom\\" is shot by S.H.A.D.E. operatives, thus signalling the \\"Victory of Evil\\". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his \\"fall\\" having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth. After escaping from captivity, Batman shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Beam, sending back in time and then \\"infecting\\" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into prehistoric times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death). Before Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, Barry Allen and Wally West lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and making contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid's control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid's minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid's spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the Miracle Machine Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan fails when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman (Dick Grayson), Red Robin (Tim Drake), Robin (Damian Wayne), and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time- stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with Mister Miracle, to escape the Omega Sanction. Doctor Impossible later manipulates the Crime Syndicate of America into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the Multiverse itself. The resurrection backfires, and instead creates a new being known as the Omega Man. The New 52 Darkseid on the cover of Justice League vol 2 #23.1 (November 2013). Art by Ivan Reis, and Joe Prado. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Darkseid's name is first invoked by a Parademon in Justice League #1. He is later mentioned again in Justice League #2, and in Justice League #3 Darkseid makes his first appearance in the series, seen in a vision by Victor Stone after he is injured by an exploding Mother Box. In the final pages of Justice League #4, Darkseid himself appears. In Justice League #5, the League confronts him but they are overpowered by him, when he severely hurts Superman with his Omega Beams and breaks Green Lantern's arm. Finally, in Justice League #6, Darkseid is driven out when Cyborg activates the invaders' Mother Boxes and Superman forces him through a boom tube. The incidents that occur in these issues make Darkseid the very first foe the newly formed League faces as a team. The issue also reveals DeSaad and Steppenwolf, referring to Darkseid's daughter and their ceaseless search for her across countless worlds. Darkseid's daughter escapes containment in Justice League of America's Vibe #7 after the dampeners on her cage are temporarily disabled. In the New 52 continuity, there is only one set of New Gods across the 52 Multiverse. So as Darkseid invades Prime Earth in Justice League, he sends his lieutenant Steppenwolf to do the same, with greater success, on Earth 2, resulting in the deaths of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and stranding Helena Wayne and Kara Zor-L on Prime Earth. Five years later, Darkseid once again invades Earth 2, which never fully recovered from his armies' earlier assault, and it is revealed that he and Highfather of New Genesis struck a deal allowing him the unchallenged right to invade Earth 2. In Darkseid #1, his background story was revealed. Formerly a farmer named Uxas, he hated the deities of his world. So he traveled up to their mountain while they slept and tricked them all into fighting each other. As they were all weakened from the war, he killed them one by one with his scythe (similar to Kronos of Greek mythology) and stole their power, before destroying his world and creating Apokolips. In Justice League: The Darkseid War (after the retirement of the \\"New 52\\" imprint), Darkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor. Darkseid's daughter Grail leads the Anti-Monitor, who is revealed to be a scientist named Mobius, to Darkseid for the former to kill the latter. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the Black Racer with Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Later, Lex Luthor would be merged with the Omega Sanction, becoming the new ruler of Apokolips. After killing the Anti-Monitor using an Anti-Life Equation-powered Steve Trevor, Grail would later resurrect Darkseid through the newborn child of Superwoman. The child has the same powers as his father Mazahs, with the ability to steal the powers of others. Stealing the new \\"God\\" abilities of the Justice League, Grail fuses them with the child and brings Darkseid back to life. However, he is under her complete control. Grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing Darkseid with the Anti-Life Equation. However, it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently. DC Rebirth Darkseid (as a baby) appears in DC Universe: Rebirth #1 where Grail tells him of Wonder Woman's long lost brother, Jason. Baby Darkseid reappears in Dark Nights: Metal where it is shown that Batman stole him from Grail and intends to use the Omega Beams to send himself back in time. This never comes to fruition and Darkseid is either returned to or retrieved by Grail. Sometime afterwards, Darkseid matured into a toddler, and using telepathy, demanded that he needed to feast on Old Gods to return to his former self. After killing A.R.G.U.S. agents that were hunting them down, Darkseid and Grail began hunting down and taking the life force of Zeus' demi- god children, killing several including Perseus and Hercules, and growing into the size of a child. After recruiting Jason and luring Wonder Woman to him, Darkseid ages once again into a young man. He fights Wonder Woman himself and as he starts to drain her life force, he is betrayed by Jason. When Zeus appears and transforms into his true form, Darkseid fights the Olympian God, destroying their surroundings in their brawl. When they take a Boom Tube to Manila, Philippines, Zeus grabs onto Darkseid and unleashes bolts of lightning on him. However, Darkseid reveals that he planned for this and that his true target was Zeus himself, and he begins to drain and kill him, restoring Darkseid back to his original self. When the rest of the Justice League arrive, Darkseid decides it is best not to fight them as he does not want to risk revealing his greater plans, and promptly leaves through a Boom Tube with Grail. Powers and abilities Darkseid disintegrates Desaad with his Omega Beams in New Gods (vol. 1) #11 (November 1972). Art by Jack Kirby. Darkseid is among the most powerful beings of the DC Universe from the race known as New Gods. His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that he fires from his eyes or hands as either a concussive force or a disintegrating energy which is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Some super-beings, such as Superman and Doomsday, have proven to be resistant to the beams, although in the case of Superman, with a great deal of pain. Also, Orion and Diana were able to deflect them, Firestorm once used his powers to redirect them and in a crossover story, Galactus was unaffected by them. These beams stem from a cosmic energy source called the \\"Omega Effect\\". The Omega Beams can also resurrect fallen beings previously killed by them. He will sometimes use this as punishment upon those who fail him but are too valuable to kill outright. Darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy, and his unerring aim allows the beam to travel in straight lines, bend, or curve around corners and even pass through matter or other forms of energy. He can also teleport himself or others through time and space. His Omega Sanction traps organisms in a series of alternate realities, each one worse than the previous. During the Final Crisis, Darkseid used his Omega Beams to grant power to Mary Marvel, and her powers afterwards were based on Anti-Life rather than magic. Darkseid's strength is depicted as immensely high, effortlessly breaking a Green Lantern Ring with his bare hands. He has easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and the entire Justice League. He can also move with great speed, as he has been able to catch Superman off guard, and he is known to be able to react in nanoseconds. Even without Darkseid's full power and strength, he is still able to hold out his own against an Olympian God such as Zeus. He can also increase his physical size. Darkseid also has additional powers of telepathy and telekinesis, and he can create psionic avatars. While Darkseid is a deity and immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years, he is not invincible and has been killed on several occasions.Doomsday: Year One Annual In \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\", Darkseid displayed a range of deity-like powers, such as transposing the positions of two planets in different solar systems, taking mental control of the entire population of a planet, instantly absorbing all the information from another being's mind, manifesting the worst fears of other beings as realities, easily defeating incredibly powerful beings such as Mon-El, Mordru, and the Time Trapper, and pronouncing a curse. Despite Darkseid's extraordinary physical powers, he rarely engages himself personally in confrontations, as he prefers to use his superhuman intellect to manipulate or control others to his ends. Darkseid has displayed his godly abilities by sensing the death of his son Orion and fluctuations of the energy of the \\"Godwave\\". As the ruler of Apokolips, Darkseid has access to all of its military and technological resources. Darkseid is able to drain the life force of other godly beings in order to rejuvenate himself and/or return to his full power. Demi-gods are capable of slowly rejuvenating Darkseid but a god (such as Zeus) can return Darkseid back to his original form by draining them. Other versions Darkseid makes his first official appearance in Chapter 22 of the Injustice: Gods Among Us comic on Apokolips. He is seen overseeing the torture of an unseen figure as his son Kalibak approaches him. Kalibak informs his father of Superman's worldwide ceasefire on Earth. Darkseid muses if Superman has begun to soften before Kalibak asks to take a war party to personally investigate. When Kalibak sees just who it is Darkseid is torturing, the lord of Apokolips confirms the man's identity before saying, \\"He made a mistake.\\" When Kalibak asks if he can be killed, Darkseid chides his son, \\"Of course not. Who would come for him?\\" He then allows Kalibak to go, bidding him to kill the Kryptonian and take the Earth. Darkseid grins to himself as he asks to be left alone with his prisoner: Black Racer, death himself, as Darkseid resumes his torture. In the Injustice Annual, Darkseid hires the bounty hunter Lobo to go to Earth and kill Superman in retaliation for the death of Kalibak at the Man of Steel's hands. However, Lobo returns some time later after a 'therapy' session with Harley Quinn, and brazenly challenges the Dread Lord to a battle. Later, under Darkseid's command, Ares manipulates the Justice League into battle with the Greek Gods. The attempt, while initially successful, is defused by Batman and Highfather's intervention. The Greek Gods depart with no further conflict and Superman brings Ares to Darkseid to torture in exchange for Darkseid, Ares and their underlings to \\"never step foot on Earth.\\" In other media Television Live-action * Darkseid appears in the tenth and final season of Smallville. The producers commented that the character would serve as a driving force throughout the season and eventually materialize as the episodes progressed. This incarnation primarily appears as a non-corporeal being. In the two-part series finale, Darkseid is seemingly destroyed by Clark while possessing the Earth-2's Lionel Luthor, having made a deal to resurrect Lex Luthor in exchange for Lionel's body. In the Season Eleven comic book continuation, however, it is revealed that Darkseid had managed to survive and restore his physical body. Animation * Darkseid appears in Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show (1984) and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians (1985), voiced by Frank Welker. * Darkseid appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley.

In the episode \\"Disordered\\", he is mentioned as Desaad's \\"unspeakable\\" master. During the season two finale \\"Endgame\\", Vandal Savage, Desaad and G. Gordon Godfrey meet with Darkseid on Apokolips. In season three, it is revealed that Darkseid invaded Earth in the 13th century and made a deal with the immortal Savage; the two would help each other in their respective conquests across the galaxy and when Earth and Apokolips are the only two worlds remaining, they would have a final battle to determine who controls the universe. In the present-day narrative, Granny Goodness informs Darkseid that the Anti-Life Equation is inside of Halo. * Darkseid was referenced multiple times in Teen Titans Go!, before finally making his debut in the two-part episode \\"Two-Parter\\", where he was voiced by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. After he captures the Justice League, the Teen Titans travel to Apokolips to rescue them and confront Darkseid. At first, the Titans are intimidated by his voice, until Starfire offers him a lozenge that clears his throat and gives him a friendlier tone. Following this, the Titans can no longer take him seriously, and note the similarity between his new voice and that of Yankovic. When Darkseid claims that Yankovic is far more evil than he could ever be, the Titans become enraged and attack him. Darkseid effortlessly defeats them, but is eventually disintegrated by Cyborg's laser cannon. Following this, Darkseid continues to make cameo appearances in several episodes. * Darkseid appears in Justice League Action, voiced by Jonathan Adams. * Darkseid is featured in DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by John DiMaggio. He first masquerades as the math teacher \\"Dr. Seid\\". In \\"My So Called Anti-Life\\", he tricks the Super Hero Girls into solving the Anti-Life Equation for him by putting it on a test.

In \\"Lovers' Quarrel\\", Darkseid finds that Psycho has been defeated by Harley and Poison Ivy, and offers the former a chance to conquer Earth. When Harley refuses, Darkseid returns to Apokolips. =DC Animated Universe= Darkseid as he appears in Superman: The Animated Series. * Darkseid is featured in various animated series set within the DC animated universe, voiced by Michael Ironside: ** The character is introduced in Superman: The Animated Series. He is first seen as the shadowy benefactor manipulating the Metropolis crime syndicate Intergang, supplying them with alien weaponry to prepare for his invasion of Earth only for Superman to foil his plans. Superman later learns that the planets Apokolips and New Genesis have been at war for aeons until a peace treaty was formed by trading their respective ruler's sons; Darkseid's son Orion with Highfather's son Mister Miracle. Despite this truce, Darkseid searches for the Anti-Life Equation to destroy New Genesis and remake the universe in his image. Following the repeated failures of his underlings, Darkseid personally defeats Superman and nearly succeeds in conquering Earth until New Genesis' forces declare the planet under their protection. In the series finale, Darkseid bypasses this deal by brainwashing Superman into thinking he is his adopted son and manipulating the Man of Steel into invading Earth for him. Superman ultimately breaks free of Darkseid's influence and confronts him on Apokolips. As Darkseid prepares to kill Superman with his Omega Beams, the latter covers the Lord of Apokolips' eyes and causes a massive explosion which results in Darkseid's defeat. To Superman's shock, Darkseid's slaves willingly come to their master's aid by carrying him away to recover with the tyrant explaining, \\"I am many things, Kal-El, but here, I am God.\\" ** Darkseid returns in Justice League. In the two-part episode \\"Twilight\\", he seeks the Justice League's help in preventing Brainiac from assimilating Apokolips' information before destroying it. It is later revealed that Darkseid and Brainiac are working together; in exchange for luring Superman to Brainiac, Darkseid's planet would be spared. However, Darkseid betrays Brainiac by overriding his circuitry to find the Anti-Life Equation. As Brainiac's base begins to self-destruct due to the League's interference, an enraged Superman defeats Darkseid but is prevented from killing him when Batman boom tubes them to safety. Buried under the rubble, Darkseid nonchalantly says \\"Loser\\" before the base explodes. ** Darkseid makes his final appearance in Justice League Unlimited. In the penultimate episode \\"Alive!\\", the Legion of Doom travels to Brainiac's destroyed base as Lex Luthor attempts to draw his essence from the debris to reconstitute him. However, Darkseid is resurrected instead and he returns to Apokolips to reunite his forces to seek revenge against Superman. In the series finale \\"Destroyer\\", the Justice League and the Legion work together to stop Darkseid's invasion of Earth. Darkseid defeats Superman and prepares to kill him but Luthor, having visited the Source Wall and found the Anti-Life Equation, intervenes.

He has spent periods detained in the Rampton, Broadmoor and Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospitals. First arrested as a petty criminal, he was convicted and sentenced in 1974 to seven years' imprisonment for armed robbery. Additional time was added due to attacks on prisoners and guards. Upon his release in 1987, he began a bare-knuckle boxing career in the East End of London. His promoter thought he needed a more suitable name and suggested he change it to Charles Bronson in 1987, after the American actor. He was returned to prison in 1988 after being convicted of planning another robbery. He is known as a violent inmate, and has taken numerous hostages in the course of confrontations with guards, resulting in his sentence later being changed to life imprisonment. He has been held at times in each of England's three prison psychiatric hospitals. Due to his record of violent anger and mental illness in prison, Bronson is one of the highest-profile criminals in Britain. He has been featured in books, interviews, and studies in prison reform and treatment. He has said: \\"I'm a nice guy, but sometimes I lose all my senses and become nasty. That doesn't make me evil, just confused.\\" He was the subject of the 2008 film Bronson starring Tom Hardy, a biopic based loosely on his life. Bronson has written many books about his experiences and famous prisoners he has met throughout his incarceration. A self-declared fitness fanatic who has spent many years in segregation (solitary confinement), Bronson dedicated a book to exercising in confined spaces. He is an outsider artist; Bronson's paintings and illustrations of prison and psychiatric hospital life have been publicly exhibited and won him multiple awards. In 2014, he changed his name again, this time to Charles Salvador, in a mark of respect to Salvador Dal√≠, one of his favourite artists. The Charles Salvador Art Foundation was founded to promote his artwork and \\"help those in positions even less fortunate than his own\\" to participate in art.  Life  Early life Luton, Bedfordshire, which Bronson considers his home town Born Michael Gordon Peterson in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was one of three sons of Eira and Joe Peterson. His father later ran the Conservative club in Aberystwyth. His uncle and aunt each served as mayor of Luton in the 1960s and 1970s. His aunt, Eileen Parry, is quoted as saying: \\"As a boy, he was a lovely lad. He was obviously bright and always good with children. He was gentle and mild-mannered, never a bully; he would defend the weak\\". Peterson lived in Luton from the age of four, but when he was a teenager, his family moved to Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, where he started getting into trouble. By the age of 13, he was part of a gang of four robbers and was reprimanded in juvenile court after he was caught stealing. He enjoyed fighting from an early age, and was often absent from school. Bronson later returned to Luton, which he refers to as his hometown. His first job was at Tesco, which lasted two weeks before he was dismissed for attacking his manager. He passed through a number of jobs, working as a hod carrier and in a number of factories. He was imprisoned for the first time at Risley, serving time on remand for criminal damage after he smashed some parked cars following an argument with his girlfriend's father. Following his trial, he was fined and given probation. Peterson worked as a furniture remover, while regularly fighting on his nights out. After being involved in petty crime, he was in serious trouble with the authorities for the first time after crashing a stolen lorry into a car. He was apprehended in his parents' home, from the scene of the incident. The driver of the car survived the collision, resulting in Bronson not facing serious penalty, receiving fines and probation. After his trial, he returned to petty crime and menial labour. Aged 19, Bronson was convicted for his part in a smash and grab raid. The judge gave him a suspended sentence. He met Irene Kelsey in 1971, when he was still called Michael Peterson. Kelsey said that he \\"was so different from any other boys I knew. He always wore tailored suits, had perfectly-groomed sideburns and a Cockney accent.\\" Eight months later in 1972, when Kelsey was four months pregnant, the couple married at Chester Register Office. Their son is Michael Jonathan Peterson. Five years later they divorced, and Kelsey later remarried.  1974‚Äì1989  Ashworth Hospital, where Bronson spent some time as a mental health patient Bronson was convicted of armed robbery in 1974, aged twenty-two, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. He was sent to Walton Gaol, and soon ended up on the punishment block after attacking two prisoners without being provoked. He was transferred to Hull in 1975. After refusing prison work, he smashed up a workshop after an altercation with a prison officer, and was sent to the punishment block. He was also injected with the sedative chlorpromazine (which made him violently ill), and six months were added to his sentence. After recovering he continued to prove a highly challenging inmate, and was repeatedly placed in solitary confinement (isolation) for several months. He attacked fellow prisoner John Henry Gallagher with a glass jug, and was charged with grievous bodily harm. (Charges were later dropped to unlawful wounding, and he was convicted. Nine months were added to his sentence.) He was transferred to Armley Gaol. Peterson found that his reputation as a violent and highly dangerous inmate preceded him. During 1975 to 1977, he was switched between Armley, Wakefield, Parkhurst, and Walton prisons; he was taken from Yorkshire to London chained to the floor of a prison van. Kept in solitary confinement, he began a fitness programme. He continued to attack other convicts and damage prison property. While recovering in solitary from a beating given to him for punching two prison officers, Bronson was handed the divorce papers filed by his wife. At Wandsworth, he attempted to poison the prisoner in the cell next to him. He was moved to Parkhurst Prison in 1976, where he befriended the Kray twins, whom he described as \\"the best two guys I've ever met\\". He was moved back to Wandsworth after threatening to kill a prison officer. He spent four months in isolation after he was caught trying to dig his way out of his cell. After being returned to the prison's general population, he caught up with the prisoner who had informed on his escape plan, and attacked him, scarring him for life. The governor at Wandsworth wanted to transfer Bronson out of his facility, and only the C Unit (Psychiatric Wing) at Parkhurst was willing to accept him. Bronson was returned to the Isle of Wight. There he attacked a prisoner with a jam jar, and was again charged with grievous bodily harm. He attempted suicide and attacked another prison officer, and was made subject to a transfer direction order under the Mental Health Act. In December 1978, Bronson arrived at Broadmoor, but was soon transferred to Rampton Secure Hospital. Unable to adapt to forced medication, and in the company of highly disturbed and highly dangerous patients, Bronson attempted to strangle child sex murderer John White. He was apprehended just as White was giving out his death rattle. He was returned to Broadmoor, where he reunited with Ronnie Kray. At Broadmoor, Bronson attempted to strangle Gordon Robinson to death, but was prevented from doing so by the tearing of the silk tie he was using. Following this failure, Bronson became depressed, but found his spirits lifted when Ronnie Kray arranged a visit from boxer Terry Downes. In 1982, he performed his first rooftop protest after escaping to the top of Broadmoor; he tore off roof tiles. Not long after the first incident, he again reached the roof of Broadmoor. He caused ¬£250,000 worth of damage in a three-day protest before he was talked down by his family. Following further treatment, he took up art. Eventually he received more prison awards than any other inmate for his poems, prose, and cartoons. He made a third rooftop protest, this time demanding a prison transfer, but was again talked down. He began an 18-day- long hunger strike, and was eventually granted a transfer to Ashworth Hospital (then known as Park Lane Hospital) in June 1984. Though Bronson was more settled in the more modern facilities and regime at Ashworth, he soon returned to his previous behaviour. He used a sauce bottle to stab Mervin Horley, a patient who made sexual advances towards him. He was returned to the general prison population at Risley Remand Centre in 1985, but was placed in isolation after punching a fellow inmate. In May 1985, Bronson pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm for the attack on Horley, and three years were added to his sentence. Later in the year he was returned to Walton, where he made another three-day rooftop protest, causing ¬£100,000 worth of damage. Authorities added another year to his sentence. He was moved to Albany, where he punched another convict on his first day in general prison population. He was quickly moved to Wormwood Scrubs, and two weeks later was returned to Wandsworth. In 1986 Bronson was transferred eight times, the only new location being Winchester. He strangled the governor of Wormwood Scrubs during one particularly violent episode. On 3 January 1987 he was transferred to Gartree, where he served the rest of his sentence in isolation, other than ten days spent in nearby Leicester Prison. 1987‚Äì1999 Upon his release from Gartree, Peterson was met by his family and stayed with his parents for a few days in Aberystwyth. He journeyed by train to London, bought a water pistol, modified it, and used it to intimidate a stranger into driving him to Luton. Bronson embarked on a short-lived career in illegal bare-knuckle boxing in the East End of London on the advice of long-time friend Reggie Kray. He changed his name from Michael Peterson to Charles Bronson in 1987 on the advice of his fight promoter, Paul Edmonds, although he had never seen a film starring the American actor Charles Bronson. He offered to fight Lenny McLean, but was refused. He also said that he killed a rottweiler with his bare hands in a ¬£10,000 underground fight. Later he said that this was \\"not something I'm proud of because I love animals.\\" To the surprise of his girlfriend Alison, on New Year's Day 1988 he robbed a jewellery shop, kept a ring for her, and sold the rest. On 7 January 1988, his 69th day of freedom, he was apprehended and arrested on his morning jog. The arresting officers charged him under his fighting name, Charles Bronson, and he decided at that moment to give up the name Michael Peterson. He was returned to Leicester Prison, as Bedford Prison refused to house him on account of his uncontrollable behaviour during his first stretch in prison. His defence had looked strong as eyewitnesses refused to testify due to fear of reprisals. Alison retracted her initial testimony and became the prosecution's main witness; this not only removed Bronson's alibi but gave the prosecution all the evidence needed to win the case. Bronson made a failed bid to reach the prison's roof, and was transferred to Brixton. Bronson was placed in a top-secure unit of 16 prisoners at Brixton. In June 1988, he pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced to seven years. Bronson was taken to Wandsworth, before being transferred to Full Sutton. There he spent time in isolation for punching a prisoner and a prison officer, and throwing water on the governor. He also spent a month at Durham, where he bonded with a family of rodents that crept into his cell. In 1989 he was moved to Long Lartin, and seemed to settle at the prison. However, he eventually \\"went over the edge\\" and ran riot in the nude, clutching onto a spear he fashioned out of a broken bottle and a broom handle. After another incident where Bronson began a one-man riot, he was put into isolation. He spent two months at Bristol, before being moved to Birmingham, Winchester, and back to Wandsworth in September 1989. He was regularly moved and regularly in trouble, particularly so when he punched two prison officers at Gartree and took the Deputy Governor hostage at Frankland. At Parkhurst he was on the receiving end of an attack, when at least two prisoners stabbed him in the back several times; Bronson refused to speak to the police about it. He recovered from the attack without further incidents, and was released from prison in November 1992. Bronson spent 53 days as a free man before being arrested once more, this time for conspiracy to rob. He was remanded at the newly opened Woodhill Prison, but insisted that his girlfriend Kelly-Anne, her friend Carol, and her lover were lying to the police in order to get him locked away. On 9 February 1993, the charges of robbery were dismissed; he was given a ¬£600 fine for breaking the nose of Kelly-Anne's lover. Sixteen days later he was arrested for conspiracy to rob and for possession of a sawn-off shotgun. On remand in Woodhill, he took a civilian librarian hostage, and demanded an inflatable doll, a helicopter, and a cup of tea from police negotiators. He released the hostage after being disgusted when the man broke wind in front of him. Bronson was taken from Belmarsh to Bullingdon Prison for his trial. For the trial he pleaded guilty to possessing the shotgun, but not guilty for the conspiracy charges. He told the jury he had intended to use the shotgun to blow his head off. On 14 September 1993, he was found guilty of 'intent to rob' and not guilty of conspiracy to rob, while his co-defendant was found innocent of all charges. He was given an eight-year sentence. Bronson was taken from Belmarsh to Wakefield, where he spent 40 days naked in isolation. He was transferred to Hull in November, where he spent a number of months without incident before he took deputy governor Adrian Wallace hostage on Easter Monday 1994. He was overpowered by guards, and was transferred to Leicester. He was returned to Wakefield, where he was confined to what was known as the \\"Hannibal Cage\\", previously occupied by Robert Maudsley. While there, prison officers Mick O'Hagan and Alan Jarvis encouraged Bronson to take up art, and he began to concentrate on cartooning. His father died in September 1994, during a period when Bronson was in constant solitary confinement and was moved almost weekly. He attacked the governor at High Down, who had felt safe enough to visit Bronson on his own, telling his prison officers that \\"he's okay with me\\". At Lincoln he was allowed to spend time with Down syndrome children, and was taken out of solitary and placed back on the prison wings after getting along well with the children. He was returned to isolation after returning from 30-minutes' exercise 30 minutes late. Belmarsh Prison, where Bronson took two Iraqi hijackers hostage In April 1996, he was sent back to Belmarsh after taking a doctor hostage at Birmingham. Five months later, an Iraqi hijacker bumped into him in the canteen and did not apologise. After a long period of brooding, Bronson took two other Iraqi hijackers, along with another inmate named Jason Greasley, hostage in a cell. By his own admission, he was \\"losing it badly\\" and ranted about his dead father, saying that any \\"funny business\\" would result in him \\"snapping necks\\". He sang and laughed and forced the Iraqis to tickle his feet and call him 'General'. He demanded a plane to take him to Libya, two Uzi sub- machine guns, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, and an axe. He released Greasley, but began chanting \\"I want ice cream\\". He felt guilty after hitting one of the hostages with a metal tray and therefore insisted the same hostage hit him over the head four times so as to call it 'quits'. He slashed himself four times with a safety razor, but agreed to release the hostages and walk back to the segregation unit. Another seven years were added to his sentence, though this was reduced to five on appeal. In October 1996, Bronson was unsettled as he had an unexpected visit from Robert Taylor, a doctor, instead of his regular lawyer. He took Taylor hostage, but released him 30 minutes later after coming to his senses; Taylor refused to assist a prosecution. In January 1999, he took Phil Danielson, a civilian education worker, hostage, as he had criticised one of Bronson's drawings. Bronson tore up the prison, throwing refrigeration units and furniture around. He was shocked and knocked unconscious for a few minutes when wrenching a washing machine out of the wall. The siege lasted for 44 hours before he released Danielson. Bronson was transferred to Whitemoor. For the incident Bronson received a discretionary life sentence to run a minimum of three years. Later in 1999 a special prison unit was set up at Woodhill for Bronson, Robert Maudsley and Reginald Wilson, to reduce the risk they posed to staff and other prisoners. Danielson received ¬£65,000 in compensation from the Home Office in an out-of-court settlement, although the prison service did not admit liability for its negligence in failing to protect a civilian employee. 2001 ‚Äì present In 2001, Bronson married again, this time in HMP Woodhill to Fatema Saira Rehman, a Bangladeshi-born divorcee. She had seen his picture and an article about him in a newspaper and began writing to him. Rehman had visited Bronson ten times before they married. She had worked at a women's shelter before they met, but lost her job when her employer found out about the relationship. For a short time, Bronson converted to his wife's faith of Islam, and wished to be known as Charles Ali Ahmed, but did not change his name legally. After four years he and Rehman divorced, and he renounced Islam. During this period, Bronson appealed against his life sentence, but three appeal court judges rejected the application in April 2004. In court with six prison guards surrounding him, Bronson said his wife and her daughter were helping to rehabilitate him, and references about his character, including reports from psychiatrists, were positive on this occasion. In 2007, two prison staff members at Full Sutton high security dispersal prison in the East Riding of Yorkshire were involved in a \\"control and restraint incident\\", in an attempt to prevent another hostage situation, during which Bronson had his glasses broken. Bronson received ¬£200 compensation for his broken glasses. Bronson remained a Category A prisoner when he was moved to Wakefield High-Security Prison. He was due for a parole hearing in September 2008, but this was postponed when his lawyer objected to a one-hour parole interview, requesting a full day to deal with Bronson's case. The parole hearing took place on 11 March 2009, and the board refused parole shortly afterwards. In August 2013 a petition with 10,000 signatures was presented to 10 Downing Street calling for his release. In an enclosed note, Bronson appealed to prime minister David Cameron for him to be able to \\"live what's left of my life and not be buried in the prison system\\". On 28 February 2014, Bronson violently attacked the prison governor in a television room in HMP Woodhill, over a dispute that his mail was being withheld, including two letters from his mother. The governor suffered serious bruising. In July 2014, Bronson was sentenced to two years. The prison had accepted that his mail may have been unacceptably processed. In August 2014, Bronson announced that he was changing his name via deed poll to Charles Salvador, in tribute to the artist Salvador Dali. In a hand-written statement on his website, Salvador stated that \\"The old me dried up... Bronson came alive in 1987. He died in 2014.\\" Under this new name, he began creating works of art described as \\"fantasy reality\\". A collection of these works was auctioned in October 2014. Salvador proposed to actress Paula Williamson, during a prison visit on 13 February 2017, and was accepted. She had been visiting him for five months. According to Williamson: \\"Charlie is a changed man. It is my hope that he will be released by my 40th birthday, in August 2020\\". Williamson, who had minor roles in Coronation Street and Emmerdale, married Salvador in the prison chapel on 14 November 2017. It became known in July 2018 that Bronson asked for divorce after photo evidence of a young British holidaygoer motorboating on her chest and inviting him and his friends to her apartment, whilst on holiday in Tenerife, was leaked to a newspaper. She claimed he requested his wife to wear a catsuit when she next visited him, a suggestion she rejected. On 29 July 2019, Williamson, aged 38, was found dead at her home in Stoke-on-Trent. Her death was not considered suspicious by the police. In November 2018, Bronson was found not guilty at Leeds Crown Court after being tried for attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. The incident the previous January had involved Mark Docherty, the governor at Wakefield prison. \\"For the first time in 44 years in prison I never intended to be violent. I never meant to hurt the governor\\", Bronson told the court (via Videolink) while defending himself. Shortly after his acquittal, he was moved to HM Prison Woodhill.  Occupations and projects  While in prison, Bronson developed a fitness regime and in 2008 claimed he could still do 172 press-ups in 60 seconds and 94 press-ups in 30 seconds. In 2002, he published the book Solitary Fitness, detailing an individual training process with minimal resources and space. ‚Äì Total pages: 215 Since 1999, Bronson has occupied himself by writing poetry and producing artworks; he has had eleven books published, including in 2008 his only self-penned book Loonyology: In My Own Words. He has won 11 Koestler Trust Awards for his poetry and art. On 28 April 2010, BBC News reported that artwork by Bronson was displayed on the London Underground at Angel tube station from 26 April 2010 for two weeks. The display was organised by Art Below, which is unrelated to the official Transport For London art programme. The National Victims' Association, which represents families affected by crime, queried the desirability of allowing Bronson \\"to engage with the British public in this way\\". His work was soon removed by an unknown party for unexplained reasons. The Guardian reported in 2014 that the sale of several of Bronson's artworks, which were formerly owned by Ronnie Kray, raised several thousand pounds for his mother to have a holiday. It followed her upset after Bronson's reported attack launched against 12 prison guards at HMP Woodhill. In 2016, he auctioned one of his artworks to raise money for the treatment of a child with cerebral palsy. Film of Bronson's life Tom Hardy Bronson, which loosely follows Bronson's life, was released in Britain on 13 March 2009. It stars Tom Hardy in the eponymous role, and is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Controversy was caused at the premi√®re when a recording of Bronson's voice was played with no prior permission granted by officers at HM Prison Service, who called for an inquiry into how the recording had been made.

The Code 39 specification defines 43 characters, consisting of uppercase letters (A through Z), numeric digits (0 through 9) and a number of special characters (-, ., $, /, +, %, and space). An additional character (denoted '*') is used for both start and stop delimiters. Each character is composed of nine elements: five bars and four spaces. Three of the nine elements in each character are wide (binary value 1), and six elements are narrow (binary value 0). The width ratio between narrow and wide is not critical, and may be chosen between 1:2 and 1:3. The barcode itself does not contain a check digit (in contrast to‚Äîfor instance‚ÄîCode 128), but it can be considered self-checking on the grounds that a single erroneously interpreted bar cannot generate another valid character. Possibly the most serious drawback of Code 39 is its low data density: It requires more space to encode data in Code 39 than, for example, in Code 128. This means that very small goods cannot be labeled with a Code 39 based barcode. However, Code 39 is still used by some postal services (although the Universal Postal Union recommends using Code 128 in all casesAs one example of an international standard, see ), and can be decoded with virtually any barcode reader. One advantage of Code 39 is that since there is no need to generate a check digit, it can easily be integrated into an existing printing system by adding a barcode font to the system or printer and then printing the raw data in that font. Code 39 was developed by Dr. David Allais and Ray Stevens of Intermec in 1974. Their original design included two wide bars and one wide space in each character, resulting in 40 possible characters. Setting aside one of these characters as a start and stop pattern left 39 characters, which was the origin of the name Code 39. Four punctuation characters were later added, using no wide bars and three wide spaces, expanding the character set to 43 characters. Code 39 was later standardised as ANSI MH 10.8 M-1983 and MIL-STD-1189. MIL-STD-1189 has been cancelled and replaced by ANSI/AIM BC1/1995, Uniform Symbology Specification ‚Äî Code 39.  Encoding  The * character presented below is not a true encodable character, but is the start and stop symbol for Code 39. The asymmetry of the symbol allows the reader to determine the direction of the barcode being scanned. This code is traditionally mapped to the * character in barcode fonts and will often appear with the human-readable representation alongside the barcode. Code 39 Characters As a generality, the location of the two wide bars can be considered to encode a number between 1 and 10, and the location of the wide space (which has four possible positions) can be considered to classify the character into one of four groups (from left to right): Letters(+30) (U‚ÄìZ), Digits(+0) (1‚Äì9,0), Letters(+10) (A‚ÄìJ), and Letters(+20) (K‚ÄìT). For example, the letter P (being the 16th letter of the alphabet) has its bars aligned to represent the number 6, and the space in the far right position to select the group Letters(+20). When represented as a digit, the number \\"10\\" is used to encode the number zero. Because there are only six letters in the Letters(+30) group (letters 30‚Äì35, or U‚ÄìZ), the other four positions in this group (36‚Äì39) are used to represent three symbols (dash, period, space) as well as the start/stop character. The two wide bars, out of five possible positions, encode a number between 1 and 10 using a two-out-of-five code with the following numeric equivalence: 1, 2, 4, 7, 0. The numbers are summed together. For example, the number 6 is encoded NWWNN, with wide bars occupying the positions for 2 and 4 (2+4=6). In the case of NNWWN which is it is assigned to 0 for digits (+0), and 10 for the letter columns (+10 ‚Äì +30).

Code 39 mod 43  Code 39 is sometimes used with an optional modulo 43 check digit. Using it requires this feature to be enabled in the barcode reader. The code with check digit is referred to as Code 39 mod 43. To compute this, each character is assigned a value. The assignments are listed in the table above, and almost, but not quite, systematic. Here is how to do the checksum calculation: * Take the value (0 through 42) of each character in the barcode excluding start and stop codes. * Sum the values. * Divide the result by 43. * The remainder is the value of the checksum character to be appended.

H√ºckel Superior Velour fedora from 1930's. A piece of velour fabric. Velour or velours is a plush, knitted fabric or textile similar to velvet or velveteen. It is usually made from cotton, but can also be made from synthetic materials such as polyester. Velour is used in a wide variety of applications, including clothing and upholstery. Velour can also refer to a rough natural leather sometimes called velour leather. Chrome tanned leather is ground from the inside, which forms a delicate, soft layer on the surface. It is used for footwear, clothing, and upholstery. This type of leather is often confused with velvet suede and chamois. Uses Velour can be a woven or a knitted fabric, allowing it to stretch. It combines the stretchy properties of knits with the rich appearance and feel of velvet. Velour is used in dance wear for the ease of movement it affords, and is also popular for warm, colorful, casual clothing. When used as upholstery, velour often is substituted for velvet. The velour widely used in the manufacture of theater drapes and stage curtains is manufactured using the same weaving process as velvet: two sets of warps and wefts woven at the same time, with additional threads that will become the nap in between, then cut apart to produce the two separate tufted fabrics. Cotton velours used for this range from 16oz per linear yard to 32oz per linear yard, synthetic versions typically run 13oz to 32oz per linear yard.

It is about in length and lives on the western coast of Madagascar, in the Comoros, and the coast of East Africa. It typically inhabits trees and can also be found near human dwellings. The Dull day gecko feeds on insects and nectar. Scientific synonyms *Pachydactylus dubius Boettger, 1881 *Phelsuma dubia - Kluge, 1993 *Phelsuma dubia - Glaw & Vences, 1994: 298 *Phelsuma dubia - Broadley & Howell, 1991: 10 *Phelsuma dubia - R√∂sler, 2000: 101 Description This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of approximately 15 cm. The body colour varies between grayish green, grayish brown and bluish green. The tail may be bright blue. A rust-coloured stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. There is a red v-shaped stripe on the snout. On the back there often are brownish or red-brick coloured dots. A gray lateral stripe extends from the eye to the hind leg. The ventral side is off-white coloured. Juveniles have a light brown dorsal surface with little light blue spots. The tail of neonates is yellow. Distribution This species inhabits the west coast of Madagascar in the general area of Majunga. It can also be found in the Comoros, in Zanzibar, and some coastal areas of mainland Tanzania. Habitat P. dubia can easily adapt to different biotopes. These day geckos are often found on different trees and other lowland vegetation. They also inhabit buildings as a human commensal. Diet These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, nectar and balsamic vinegar. Behaviour P. dubia often lives in small groups with one male and several females. Reproduction The females are egg gluers. They often lay their eggs in the same location as other females. Care and maintenance in captivity Phelsuma dubia is currently common and widespread. However, capture of these geckos is regulated, as it may have caused population declines and, as it is large- scale, might threaten the species in the future. These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28 ¬∞C. The humidity should be not too high. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth, fruit flies, meal worms and houseflies. References * Henkel, F.-W. and W.

RR Lyrae variables are periodic variable stars, commonly found in globular clusters. They are used as standard candles to measure (extra) galactic distances, assisting with the cosmic distance ladder. This class is named after the prototype and brightest example, RR Lyrae. They are pulsating horizontal branch stars of spectral class A or F, with a mass of around half the Sun's. They are thought to have shed mass during the red-giant branch phase, and were once stars of similar or slightly less mass than the Sun, around 0.8 solar masses. In contemporary astronomy, a period-luminosity relation makes them good standard candles for relatively nearby targets, especially within the Milky Way and Local Group. They are also frequent objects in the studies of globular clusters and the chemistry (and quantum mechanics) of older stars. Discovery and recognition H-R diagram for globular cluster M5, with the horizontal branch marked in yellow and known RR Lyrae stars in green In surveys of globular clusters, these \\"cluster-type\\" variables were being rapidly identified in the mid-1890s, especially by E. C. Pickering. Probably the first star of definitely RR Lyrae type found outside a cluster was U Leporis, discovered by J. Kapteyn in 1890. The prototype star RR Lyrae was discovered prior to 1899 by Williamina Fleming, and reported by Pickering in 1900 as \\"indistinguishable from cluster-type variables\\". From 1915 to the 1930s, the RR Lyraes became increasingly accepted as a class of star distinct from the classical Cepheids, due to their shorter periods, differing locations within the galaxy, and chemical differences. RR Lyrae variables are metal-poor, Population II stars. RR Lyraes have proven difficult to observe in external galaxies because of their intrinsic faintness. (In fact, Walter Baade's failure to find them in the Andromeda Galaxy led him to suspect that the galaxy was much farther away than predicted, to reconsider the calibration of Cepheid variables, and to propose the concept of stellar populations.) Using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in the 1980s, Pritchet & van den Bergh found RR Lyraes in Andromeda's galactic halo and, more recently, in its globular clusters. Classification The RR Lyrae stars are conventionally divided into three main types, following classification by S.I. Bailey based on the shape of the stars' brightness curves: * RRab variables are the most common, making up 91% of all observed RR Lyrae, and display the steep rises in brightness typical of RR Lyrae * RRc are less common, making up 9% of observed RR Lyrae, and have shorter periods and more sinusoidal variation * RRd are rare, making up between <1% and 30% of RR Lyrae in a system, and are double-mode pulsators, unlike RRab and RRc Distribution RR Lyrae-type variable stars close to the galactic center from the VVV ESO public survey RR Lyrae stars were formerly called \\"cluster variables\\" because of their strong (but not exclusive) association with globular clusters; conversely, over 80% of all variables known in globular clusters are RR Lyraes. RR Lyrae stars are found at all galactic latitudes, as opposed to classical Cepheids, which are strongly associated with the galactic plane. Because of their old age, RR Lyraes are commonly used to trace certain populations in the Milky Way, including the halo and thick disk. Several times as many RR Lyraes are known as all Cepheids combined; in the 1980s, about 1900 were known in globular clusters. Some estimates have about 85000 in the Milky Way. Though binary star systems are common for typical stars, RR Lyrae are very rarely observed in pairs. Properties RR Lyrae stars pulse in a manner similar to Cepheid variables, but the nature and histories of these stars is thought to be rather different. Like all variables on the Cepheid instability strip, pulsations are caused by the Œ∫-mechanism, when the opacity of ionised helium varies with its temperature. RR Lyraes are old, relatively low mass, Population II stars, in common with W Virginis and BL Herculis variables, the type II Cepheids. Classical Cepheid variables are higher mass population I stars. RR Lyrae variables are much more common than Cepheids, but also much less luminous. The average absolute magnitude of an RR Lyrae star is about +0.75, only 40 or 50 times brighter than our Sun. Their period is shorter, typically less than one day, sometimes ranging down to seven hours. Some RRab stars, including RR Lyrae itself, exhibit the Blazhko effect in which there is a conspicuous phase and amplitude modulation. Period-luminosity relationships Typical RR Lyrae light curve Unlike Cepheid variables, RR Lyrae variables do not follow a strict period-luminosity relationship at visual wavelengths, although they do in the infrared K band. They are normally analysed using a period-colour-relationship, for example using a Wesenheit function. In this way, they can be used as standard candles for distance measurements although there are difficulties with the effects of metallicity, faintness, and blending. The effect of blending can impact RR Lyrae variables sampled near the cores of globular clusters, which are so dense that in low- resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously too bright, given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined. Consequently, the computed distance is wrong, and certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder, and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant. Recent developments The Hubble Space Telescope has identified several RR Lyrae candidates in globular clusters of the Andromeda Galaxy and has measured the distance to the prototype star RR Lyrae. The Kepler space telescope provided extended coverage of a single field with accurate photometric data. RR Lyrae itself was in Kepler field of view. The Gaia mission mapped 140,784 RR Lyraes, of which 50,220 were previously not known to be variable, and for which 54,272 interstellar absorption estimates are available.

It is a foundation garment or an article of lingerie usually made from a sheer fabric similar to that used for stockings or pantyhose, or from fishnet, lace or an opaque material, or a variation of these materials. A bodystocking differs from a unitard, which is worn as an outfit or article of clothing, and a leotard, which is used as a practice garment or performance costume for acrobats, gymnasts and other similar performers. Designed to be revealed, but not to be too revealing, bodystockings may be worn as undergarments by performers such as belly dancers and exotic dancers. Description A woman wearing an open crotch fishnet bodystocking Oftentimes bodystockings are made of sheer fabric and are worn with or without undergarments such as a bra. Bodystockings normally come in only two sizes, especially when they use stretch material. A body stocking may be worn for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or a skirt. When worn as underwear, it is usually not worn with other underwear. It may be worn with panties for extra coverage or a bra for extra support. Sheer body stockings are too revealing to be worn alone. Opaque bodystockings can be worn in place of tights and a blouse. Bodystockings also come in fishnet, lace and satin, the latter which may just consist of the top portion of the bodystocking, allowing it to be worn underneath a suit jacket to serve as a blouse. These types of bodystockings are also made sheer, enabling the wearer to wear a more revealing outfit coupled with sheer coverage for line smoothing. Bodystockings are put on through the neck, in a similar technique to putting on a pair of tights: the body and arm sections are rolled down and then the legs are scrunched up like stockings; one would put one foot in and pull the stocking part up, and then the same on the other leg; from the waist, the bodystocking is pulled up over the torso to the chest, and then the arms are scrunched up and put on in same way as the legs; and the garment is then adjusted as required, and any ribbons and fasteners tied.How to Wear a Bodystocking Due to its design, and its close-fitting and one-piece aspect, the wearer may have to remove the bodystocking in order to urinate or defecate, but crotchless bodystockings are also available. If a bodystocking is a foundation garment, all the over clothing will also need to be removed. History It is unclear when the first bodystocking was made or when it was first worn. The first notable occasion was when American actress Adah Isaacs Menken wore one in 1861 in the play Mazeppa, based on Byron's \\"Mazeppa\\", in which she played a Ukrainian man who was tied nude to the back of a wild horse by his enemies. In the scene Menken wore a flesh coloured bodystocking to preserve her modesty while giving the illusion of nudity. The practice created controversy.Brooks, Daphne A. ‚ÄúLady Menken‚Äôs Secret: Adah Isaacs Menken, Actress Biographies and the Race for Sensation.‚Äù Legacy, Volume 15. Number 1. (1998): pages 68-77.

He is currently signed to Impact Wrestling. Gerin started his career in the Canadian independent circuit as Rhino Richards. He was signed by the American promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1999, where he shortened his name to Rhino. He would remain with ECW until the closure of the promotion in 2001, where he won the ECW World Heavyweight Championship and the ECW Television Championship, being the final champion of both titles. After ECW closed, he was signed by the World Wrestling Federation with several other ECW wrestlers and was involved in The Invasion storyline, where talent from ECW and WCW joined forces against WWF wrestlers. He worked as Rhyno for WWF until 2005, when he left the promotion. Then, he signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he defeated Jeff Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. However, he would lose the title two days after his title victory. During the following years, Rhino remained with TNA until his exit in 2010. In 2015, Gerin would make his return to WWE. He worked in NXT, the developmental territory of WWE as a veteran. However, he would be promoted to the main roster in December. During his time on the SmackDown brand, he teamed with Heath Slater, with whom he won a tournament to become the inaugural SmackDown Tag Team Champions. He left WWE again in 2019 and made his return to TNA, now called Impact Wrestling.  Early life  Gerin was born on October 7, 1975, in Detroit, Michigan. He is of Italian descent.  Professional wrestling career   Early career (1994‚Äì1998)  Gerin trained as a wrestler at the Can-Am Wrestling School located in Windsor, Ontario under Scott D'Amore, with whom he later reunited in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He began training on September 24, 1994, and had his first match on March 10, 1995. Gerin made four appearances in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as enhancement talent under the ring name Rhino Richards. Richards lost to \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan on the August 5, 1994 edition of WCW Saturday Night. WCW Television Champion The Renegade defeated Richards on the September 9 edition of WCW Pro. Richards and Johnny Swinger lost to the Nasty Boys on the September 16 edition of WCW Saturday Night. His final appearance was a loss to Road Warrior Hawk on the September 24, 1995 edition of WCW WorldWide. In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Gerin lost to Henry O. Godwinn on the November 6, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw. He was part of the losing team in a six-man tag team match against The Truth Commission at the June 23, 1997 WWF Shotgun Saturday Night taping (aired June 28).\\"WWF matches wrestled by Rhyno\\". The Internet Wrestling Database. Retrieved June 25, 2018. Gerin then adopted the ring name Rhino Richards and began wrestling in Canada, where he formed a stable known as \\"THUG Life\\" with Joe Legend, Zakk Wyld (Keith Assoun), Christian Cage, Bloody Bill Skullion, Brett Kimball, and Sexton Hardcastle (later named Edge). He wrestled a dark match at the June 29, 1998 WWF Shotgun Saturday Night taping, defeating Breyer Wellington.  Catch Wrestling Association (1997‚Äì1998)  In 1997, Gerin relocated to Hanover, Germany, where he began competing for the Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) under the ring name \\"Rhino Richards\\". On October 10, 1998, he teamed with XL Legend to win the vacant CWA World Tag Team Championship, defeating Rico de Cuba and August Smisl. The titles were vacated in October 1998 when Gerin left the promotion after signing with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).  Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2001)  Gerin debuted in ECW in 1999 as Rhino. Rhino quickly joined forces with Steve Corino and Jack Victory. Rhino and Corino challenged Tommy Dreamer and Raven for the ECW World Tag Team Championship at Anarchy Rulz, but were defeated. In late 1999, Rhino began feuding with The Sandman, and at November to Remember he teamed with the Impact Players to defeat Dreamer, Raven, and Sandman. On March 12, 2000, Rhino lost to Super Crazy in the finals of a tournament for the World Television Championship at Living Dangerously. He won the title on April 22, defeating Yoshihiro Tajiri at CyberSlam. He lost the title to Kid Kash on August 26, but regained it a little over two weeks later on September 9. Throughout mid-2000, Rhino continued to feud with The Sandman, defeating him in title matches at Hardcore Heaven and Heatwave. In the course of the match with The Sandman at Hardcore Heaven, Rhino performed a Rhino Driver to the Sandman's wife and valet, Lori. At Heatwave, Rhino attacked the couple before his match and attempted to force Lori's head into a toilet. Rhino won the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on January 7, 2001 at Guilty as Charged, defeating Sandman in a squash match immediately after The Sandman had won the title from Steve Corino in a three-way tables, ladders, chairs, and canes match. He defended the title twice afterwards, defeating The Sandman on January 12 and Spike Dudley on January 13, 2001 on the last two ECW shows before ultimately becoming both the final World Heavyweight Champion and World Television Champion due to the company folding in April.  World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment   The Alliance (2001‚àí2002)  Following the closure of ECW, Gerin signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He debuted on the March 19, 2001 episode of Raw, in Albany, New York at the Pepsi Arena, under the ring name Rhyno as a heel, aligning himself with Edge and Christian. Rhyno went on to help Edge and Christian defeat The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz for the WWF Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at WrestleMania X-Seven. On the April 19 edition of SmackDown!, Rhyno defeated Kane to win the WWF Hardcore Championship. At Backlash, he defeated Raven to retain the title. At Judgment Day, Rhyno, Edge, and Christian formed a stable with Kurt Angle known as Team RECK, with all four members reaching the semi-finals of the King of the Ring. Rhyno was eliminated from the event by the eventual winner, Edge. He won the Hardcore Championship a total of three times in mid-2001. On the July 9 episode of Raw, Rhyno \\"invaded\\" the WWF along with other ECW wrestlers. The group, led by former ECW owner Paul Heyman, went on to merge with rival organization WCW later that night, forming The Alliance. At Invasion, Rhyno competed in the main event the Inaugural Brawl match; five-on-five tag team match where Team WCW/ECW (Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, (WCW) Rhyno and the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) (ECW)) defeated Team WWF (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker and Kane). Rhyno feuded with Chris Jericho due to Jericho insulting Stephanie McMahon, the on-screen owner of ECW, on numerous occasions. One notable moment during the feud saw Rhyno Gore Jericho through the SmackDown! stage set on the August 9 episode of SmackDown!. At SummerSlam, Rhyno faced Jericho in a losing effort. On September 23 at Unforgiven, he defeated fellow ECW alumnus Tajiri for the WCW United States Championship. He held the title for just under a month before losing to Kurt Angle on the October 22 episode of Raw. As a result of his loss, Rhyno was \\"suspended\\" from The Alliance on the October 25 episode of SmackDown!. The suspension was an angle concocted to explain Rhyno's absence while he underwent cervical fusion surgery for two herniated discs in his neck. The surgery was successfully performed on November 12, 2001.  Brand switches (2003‚Äì2005)  Rhyno returned to WWE television sixteen months later on the February 27, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, aligning himself with Chris Benoit and thus becoming a face for the first time in his WWE career. Rhyno and Benoit went on to unsuccessfully challenge Team Angle for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a triple threat tag team match (also involving Los Guerreros) at WrestleMania XIX. At Judgment Day, Rhyno teamed with Spanky, and Chris Benoit in a losing effort against John Cena and The Full Blooded Italians (Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli). At Vengeance, Rhyno turned on Benoit during a United States Championship match against Eddie Guerrero, thus turning heel once again. Rhyno continued to wrestle on SmackDown! pursuing the United States Championship on several occasions. At SummerSlam, Rhyno competed in a Fatal four-way match for the WWE United States Championship but failed to win the title. At the Royal Rumble, Rhyno competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he entered at #6 but was eliminated by Chris Benoit. In March 2004, Rhyno was drafted to the Raw brand in the 2004 WWE Draft Lottery. Later that night, he faced Chris Benoit for the World Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort. The next week on Raw, he turned face again by first squashing then heel Lance Storm in a match and then forming a tag team with Tajiri. The duo challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on several occasions throughout 2004. In January 2005 on an episode of Raw, Rhyno lost a Royal Rumble qualifying match to Edge. Rhyno was released from his WWE contract on April 9, 2005 along with his friend Matt Hardy due to a public argument with his wife that took place at the WrestleMania 21 afterparty. He made his final appearance on WWE television at the WWE-produced ECW reunion pay-per-view One Night Stand on June 12, where he lost to Sabu.  Total Nonstop Action Wrestling   Debut and NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign (2005)  Rhino competing for TNA in Orlando, Florida After time on the independent circuit, Gerin made his debut in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on July 17, 2005 as Rhino, reverting to the ECW spelling of his wrestling name. He debuted by hitting then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Raven with the Gore following a match with Abyss at No Surrender, thus debuting as both a heel and a member of Planet Jarrett. These events led to a match being scheduled between the team of Rhino and Jeff Jarrett and the team of Raven and the returning Sabu at Sacrifice on August 14. During the Sacrifice preshow, Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko informed Jarrett, who had lobbied for a title shot for several weeks, that if he could pin Raven, he would receive a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Unbreakable. However, should Jarrett lose the match, he would be prohibited from receiving an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match for one year. Later that night, during the tag match, Jeff Hardy returned to TNA, attacking Jarrett and enabling Rhino to Gore and pin Raven. An irate Jarrett, furious at having lost his shot at the title, watched as Zbyszko announced Rhino to be the new number one contender immediately after the pay-per-view went off the air. Rhino faced Raven at Unbreakable in a match which saw him accidentally Gore a shopping cart in homage to his WWF Hardcore Championship bout with Raven at Backlash in the WWF. Despite interference from Jarrett, Raven retained his title after hitting Rhino with an Even Flow DDT. Rhino fought Jeff Hardy in the main event of the debut episode of Impact! on Spike TV on October 1. The match was declared a no-contest after both Abyss and Sabu interfered. At Bound for Glory, Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Hardy faced each other in a Monster's Ball match, which Rhino won after hitting a second rope Rhino Driver on Hardy. Later that night, Rhino won a 10-man Gauntlet match to determine who would face Jeff Jarrett for his NWA World Heavyweight Championship after Kevin Nash, Jarrett's scheduled opponent, was rushed to the hospital due to a legitimate injury. Rhino went on to defeat Jarrett and win the title. Rhino lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship back to Jarrett on a 2-hour prime time special episode of Impact! on November 3. Starting with the November 26 episode of Impact!, TNA started airing promos about Rhino's career and personal life in preparation for his title rematch at Turning Point. He lost the rematch to Jarrett after a guitar shot and interference from all of Team Canada.  Feuds with Abyss and Christian (2006)  Rhino making his entrance Rhino then wrapped up a brutal feud with Abyss, who (due to his alignment with Planet Jarrett) halted Rhino's war on Team Canada. The feud saw Abyss Black Hole Slam Rhino on to several chairs, and Rhino smash Abyss through a steel wall with the Gore. Their singles feud ended at Against All Odds when Rhino Gored Abyss off of a fifteen-foot ramp on to four tables. In April, Rhino became a member of Sting's four-man team of \\"Warriors\\", joining A.J. Styles and Ron Killings to fight Jeff Jarrett's \\"Army\\" in a Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown. On June 9, after Rhino defeated Jeff Jarrett at a TNA house show in the old ECW Arena in Philadelphia, he publicly acknowledged that he had been offered a contract to come back to WWE and wrestle for the new ECW. Rhino, however, decided to stay with TNA. On July 11, Rhino made an open challenge against WWE for their current incarnation of ECW. The shocking revelation was that he did not like the direction of the new ECW and threw the \\"real\\" ECW World Heavyweight Championship (hidden in a burlap sack as Rhino stated WWE threatened legal action if he showed it) into an oil drum and burned it (he later admitted that it was a replica, and he still has the original belt at his home). He then feuded with Monty Brown and Samoa Joe. This resulted in the three men competing at Hard Justice, which ended with Samoa Joe winning by pinning Monty Brown after slamming Brown through a table. Rhino then entered into a feud with Christian Cage, playing off their former history together in WWE, Japan, and Canada. The feud continued when Christian and Rhino faced off in an Eight Mile Street Fight at Bound for Glory, on October 22. Christian won after a con-chair-to with a ladder, a broken table, a street sign, and some chairs on top of Rhino. This feud culminated on the November 16 episode of Impact!, where he faced Cage in a six-sides of steel barbed wire match. Cage won the match after Rhino's Gore sent him through the door of the cage.  Feuds with A.J. Styles and James Storm (2006‚Äì2008)  Towards the end of 2006, Rhino entered into a program with A.J. Styles. This started with Rhino trying to help Styles with his situation with Christopher Daniels, only to have Styles pull away and accuse Rhino of getting into his business, thus turning him heel. Rhino would lose to Styles at Turning Point after Styles faked a knee injury and then pinned Rhino with a roll-up. The Rhino-Styles feud continued into 2007. At Final Resolution, Rhino defeated Styles in a Last Man Standing match. Rhino set up tables in anticipation of sending Styles through them with a Gore. Styles, however, saw what was happening and declined to get up, thus losing. After the match, Rhino swore he was not through with Styles and gave him a Rhino Driver on the entrance ramp. At Against All Odds, Styles defeated Rhino in a Motor City Chain match after dodging a Gore and rolling up Rhino for the pin. A.J. Styles then challenged any wrestler in TNA to wrestle him at Destination X in the debut of the Elevation X match and Rhino accepted the challenge. At Destination X, Rhino defeated A.J. Styles in the Elevation X match after a Gore, and stomping on Styles fingers. On March 22, Rhino was chosen as the third member of Kurt Angle's team for the Lockdown match, along with Samoa Joe and eventually Jeff Jarrett and Sting. Team Angle was successful at Lockdown after defeating Christian's Coalition in a Lethal Lockdown match. Rhino had a big spot in the match when he Gored Tomko through the cage door. Rhino competing at a TNA show Rhino went through short feuds with Christopher Daniels and The Latin American Xchange before moving on to his next big feud with James Storm. On the June 21 Impact!, Storm and Robert Roode defeated Rhino and Eric Young. Following the match, Storm poured beer on Rhino, causing him to snap. Two weeks later, Rhino had a sit-down interview with Mike Tenay and revealed that he was a recovering alcoholic, and that caused him to snap after being covered with beer. The feud between Rhino and Storm resulted in a match at Victory Road. Storm won the match after hitting Rhino with a beer bottle. After the match was over Storm and Jackie Moore attacked Rhino and poured beer into his mouth and left him bleeding in the ring. At Hard Justice, Rhino lost a Bar Room Brawl to Storm, after Storm smashed a beer bottle into the back of Rhino's head, but Rhino beat him at No Surrender. After the match, he Gored Moore. Rhino then feuded with Raven, resulting in a Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory between Rhino, Raven, Abyss, and Black Reign which Abyss won. At Turning Point, he was scheduled to participate in a match teaming with Abyss to take on Black Reign and Rellik, but he was replaced by Raven due to injury. After battling a kayfabe alcoholism relapse (brought on by the James Storm storyline), Rhino officially made his return at Against All Odds when he Gored Storm, which caused Eric Young to retain his World Drinking Championship. On March 9, Rhino defeated Storm at Destination X, in the second official Elevation X Match, making Rhino 2-0 in Elevation X.  Alliance with Christian and TNA Front Line (2008‚Äì2009)  The next week, Christian Cage had to find a tag partner to help him fight A.J. Styles and Tomko and asked Rhino to join him, but Rhino refused due to their past history (Cage had since turned face). Tomko, Styles, and Team 3D attacked Cage after his tag team match with Kevin Nash. The following week on Impact!, Cage managed to get Rhino on his side during an interview with Jeremy Borash. At Lockdown in the Lethal Lockdown match, Rhino pinned Storm to get the win for Cage's team. Rhino went on to form a tag team with Cage and they competed in the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament to crown new tag team champions by beating The Motor City Machine Guns (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley) to qualify. The tournament took place at Sacrifice where they beat the team of Robert Roode and Booker T, but lost in the second round to Team 3D after Brother Ray hit Rhino with a kendo stick. Rhino would beat James Storm to qualify for the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, where Samoa Joe retained the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Since then, Rhino formed a tag team with Christian Cage. At Hard Justice, Rhino and Christian Cage defeated Team 3D to end their feud. Rhino during his feud with the Godfather of the Main Event Mafia, Kurt Angle Rhyno and Christian quietly went their separate ways, with Cage going to main events and Rhino along with then TNA Women's Champion Taylor Wilde starting a feud with The Beautiful People and Cute Kip shortly after Hard Justice. At Bound for Glory IV, Rhino along with ODB and Rhaka Khan (who recently turned face) defeated The Beautiful People and Cute Kip in a Bimbo Brawl. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Rhino confronted Sheik Abdul Bashir over political views. He was later attacked by Bashir. The feud ended after Rhino got revenge and defeated Sheik at Turning Point. On the November 20 episode of Impact!, Rhino attacked The Main Event Mafia, but the Mafia fought back and placed him in a casket. The next week, Rhino officially joined A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe, naming the group the TNA Frontline. Rhino decided the Frontline had to have more members if they wanted to beat the Main Event Mafia, and, much to the surprise and questioning of the group, asked Team 3D to join the Frontline. Later in the night, Team 3D agreed to join the Frontline, helping Styles and Joe attack the Mafia. At Genesis, Rhino lost to Sting in a World Heavyweight Title match.  Heel turn (2009‚Äì2010)  At the Lockdown pre-show, Eric Young defeated Danny Bonaduce. After the bout, Bonaduce attacked Young, but Rhino came to the ring to aid Young and then Gored Bonaduce. Afterwards, Rhino began an angle that aired on television, where he would train and mentor Jesse Neal, a former member of the military, to become a pro wrestler. However, in training Jesse Neal, Rhino has become quite frustrated leading to a very short temper. This led to a tag match on August 13, 2009 where when Jesse lost the match making a \\"rookie mistake\\" by refusing a hot tag to Rhino. Rhino turned heel later by goring his former protege, Jesse Neal. Then his former mentors Team 3D had realized what a selfish man Rhino was, thus leading to a feud between them. Rhino appeared at No Surrender to face new superstar Bobby Lashley. Despite Goring Lashley twice, Rhino was defeated following a knockout punch. On the October 15 episode of Impact!, he lost a stretcher match to Bobby Lashley. The following week, Rhino would start an angle where he claimed that TNA was favoring the younger talent of the company, while trying to force veterans like himself out of the company. After weeks of persuasion, on the November 5 episode of Impact! Team 3D turned heel and joined Rhino in his cause. At Turning Point Rhino along with Team 3D defeated Matt Morgan, Hernandez and D'Angelo Dinero after a Gore by Rhino. On the November 19 episode of Impact! Jesse Neal turned heel and joined Rhino and Team 3D. Two weeks later, Suicide joined Morgan, Hernandez and Dinero to level the playing field. At Final Resolution, Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. When Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff took over TNA at the beginning of 2010, Rhino's angle was discontinued and Team 3D reverted to being faces and began feuding with The Nasty Boys.  ECW reunion and departure (2010)  Rhino performing his entrance After being absent from television for four months, Rhino returned on the July 1 episode of Impact!, appearing in the Impact! Zone crowd beside fellow ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer, Raven and Stevie Richards, thus seemingly turning back into a face. On the July 15 episode of Impact! Rhino, Dreamer, Raven, Richards, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Al Snow, led by Mick Foley, aligned themselves with the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam by attacking Abyss and the rest of the TNA locker room.

At the event Rhino defeated Al Snow and Brother Runt in a three-way match. On the following episode of Impact!, the ECW alumni, known collectively as EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair's stable, who thought they did not deserve to be in TNA. During the assault Abyss came out, fought Rob Van Dam backstage and caused him storyline injuries, which forced him to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and led to EV 2.0 looking for revenge. On the August 26 episode of Impact! Rhino called out Abyss for what he had done and then laid him out with a Gore. At No Surrender Abyss defeated Rhino in a Falls Count Anywhere match. At Bound for Glory Rhino, Dreamer, Raven, Richards and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match. Shortly afterwards Rhino's contract with TNA expired, but he remained with the promotion on a per night deal. At Turning Point EV 2.0 faced Fortune in a ten-man tag team match, where each member of EV 2.0 put their TNA careers on the line. In the end, EV 2.0 lost the match and Sabu was released from TNA. On the following episode of Impact!, Rhino revealed himself as the man within EV 2.0, who had been calling Eric Bischoff, trying to get to be a part of his Immortal stable, which had led to dissension between Rob Van Dam, who wanted to find out the traitor, and the rest of EV 2.0, by costing Van Dam his match against Kazarian and afterwards hitting Tommy Dreamer with a chair, turning heel again in the process. On the November 18 episode of Impact! Rhino explained that Bischoff had agreed to re‚Äìsign him as long as he turned on the rest of EV 2.0. The following week Dreamer defeated Rhino in a Street Fight. After the match Rhino attacked Dreamer, but was then chased away by Rob Van Dam, who challenged him to a First Blood match at Final Resolution, which Van Dam ended up winning.

Reports indicated that WWE did not have a significant issue with him doing this, and he would not be punished for it. Part of the reason for Rhyno's departure from the WWE, was the founding of his business, Big Daddy's Boat Yard.  Return to independent circuit (2019‚Äìpresent)  So far, Rhino's first match announced on the independent circuit is on July 26, for Sami Callihan's promotion The Wrestling Revolver. In the match he will team with Tommy Dreamer, Eddie Edwards and Jimmy Jacobs against Ohio Versus Everything (Sami Callihan, Jake Crist, Dave Crist and Madman Fulton) in an Extreme rules Tornado tag match. Second return to Impact Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent)  On July 7, 2019, (whilst still under contract with WWE) he returned to TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling at Slammiversary XVII under disguise in all black and a black mask. At the event, he would surprise attack the villainous Michael Elgin, who at the time was attacking Impact commentator and Executive Vice-President Don Callis. Following his release from WWE, he was then advertised for the August television tapings of Impact. On the July 26 episode of Impact, Rhino made his first Impact appearance since 2014, attacking Michael Elgin once again. On October 20, 2019, on Bound for Glory, he teamed with Rob Van Dam where they challenged for the Impact World Tag Team Championship. At the climax of the match, Van Dam turned heel by attacking Rhino, Willie Mack, and Rich Swann, losing the match in the process. In 2020, after the debut of his former WWE tag team partner Heath at Slammiversary, Rhino and Heath began a campaign to convince the company to sign Heath. At Victory Road, Rhino and Heath teamed for the first time in Impact where they defeated Reno Scum. After the match, Scott D'Amore offered Heath a contract.  Professional wrestling style and persona  Rhyno has been featured as an intimidating powerhouse with combined feats of strength and speed, known by various nicknames such as \\"The Rookie Monster\\", \\"The Big F'n Deal\\", \\"The Man Beast\\", \\"The War/Gore Machine\\" and \\"Dr. Kill\\". His finishing move during his early career was a spike piledriver called the Rhino Driver or the Rhino Spike, which he also used sometimes from the second rope or the ring apron. He later began using the Gore as his finishing move which has been associated with his career since then.  Other media  Rhyno made his film debut in the 2011 horror film Death from Above, alongside fellow wrestler Kurt Angle. Rhyno appears in ten wrestling video games. They are ECW Anarchy Rulz, ECW Hardcore Revolution, WWE SmackDown! Just Bring It, WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain, WWE Day of Reckoning, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw and TNA Impact!. He made his video game return 9 years later in WWE 2K18 and also appears in its sequel WWE 2K19.  Politics  Gerin announced on March 4, 2016, that he would run for the Michigan House of Representatives, angling for the 15th District seat, which encompasses his hometown of Dearborn. In subsequent interviews, Gerin confirmed he would run as a Republican and that he had the approval of WWE owner Vince McMahon, whose wife, former WWE CEO Linda McMahon, mounted two unsuccessful campaigns in Connecticut for a seat in the United States Senate. Incumbent George Darany, a Democratic state representative, cannot run for reelection due to term limits. On August 2, 2016, it was reported that Gerin had won the Republican Primary and would face Democratic Primary winner Abdullah Hammoud in November's general election. Gerin was defeated by Hammoud in the election, 21,739 to 13,452, a margin of 8,297 votes. On March 31, 2020, Gerin announced his run for Monroe Township Board of Trustee for Monroe Township, Michigan.  Electoral history   Personal life  Gerin in the 2000s Gerin is close friends with Adam Copeland and Jay Reso, best known by their ring names Edge and Christian. Following the SmackDown taping on September 16, 2011, Gerin made a one-night return to WWE as a part of an \\"Appreciation Night\\" to celebrate Edge's career. He also made an appearance at Edge's induction ceremony into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2012.

It was first published in 1953 by Gnome Press. Second Foundation consists of two previously published novellas originally published in Astounding Magazine (with different titles) between 1948 and 1950, making this the third volume in Asimov's Foundation series. Decades later, Asimov wrote two further sequel novels and two prequels. Later writers have added authorized tales to the series. The Foundation series is often regarded as one of Isaac Asimov's best works, along with his Robot series. The term also describes the organization by that name which is the focus of the book. The organization's existence (and nothing more) had been revealed in Foundation, searched for in Foundation and Empire, and makes brief appearances in this novel. It would not be described in detail until Foundation's Edge. Plot summary Part I: Search By the Mule Part I is about The Mule's search for the elusive Second Foundation, with the intent of destroying it. The executive council of the Second Foundation is aware of The Mule's intent and, in the words of the First Speaker, allows him to find it‚Äî\\"in a sense\\". The Mule sends two of his men on a search for the Second Foundation: Han Pritcher, who had once been a captain and a member of the underground opposition prior to being Converted to the Mule's service, and Bail Channis, an \\"Unconverted\\" man (one that hasn't been mind-manipulated by the Mule to join him) who has quickly risen through the ranks and impressed The Mule. Channis reveals his suspicions about the Second Foundation being located on the planet Tazenda, and takes the ship there. They first land on Rossem, a barren planet controlled by Tazenda, and meet with its governor, who appears ordinary. Once they return to the ship, Pritcher confronts Channis and believes him to have been too successful with the search. The Mule, who had placed a hyper-relay on their ship in order to trace them through hyper-space, appears, and reveals that Channis is a Second Foundationer. Pritcher's emotional bonds to the Mule are broken in the ensuing exchange between Channis and the Mule, and is made to fall into deep sleep. With only the two of them left, the Mule reveals that he has brought his ships to Tazenda and has already destroyed the planet, and yet senses that Channis's dismay is only pretense. He forces Channis to reveal that Rossem is actually the Second Foundation, and that Tazenda is only a figurehead. The First Speaker for the Second Foundation appears and reveals to the Mule that his rule is over; neither Tazenda nor Rossem is the Second Foundation, and Channis's knowledge had been falsely implanted to mislead the Mule. Second Foundation agents are headed to Kalgan and the Foundation worlds to undo the Conversions of the Mule, and his fleet is too far away to prevent it. When the Mule experiences a moment of despair, the First Speaker is able to seize control of and change his mind; he will return to Kalgan and live out the rest of his short life as a benevolent despot. Search by the Mule was originally published in the January 1948 issue of Astounding Science Fiction under the title \\"Now You See It...\\". Part II: Search By the Foundation Part II takes place 60 years after the first part, 55 years after the Mule's death by natural causes. Those of the (First) Foundation, which left the Mule's empire based on Kalgan after his death, are now aware of the Second Foundation's existence; although they, like the Mule, only know that it is located \\"at the other end of the galaxy\\", they know that it contributed to his defeat. Foundationists and many others believe that the Second Foundation's protection guarantees the success of the Seldon Plan despite crises, such as the Foundation's ongoing conflict with Kalgan. The ensuing war is won by the Foundation, and is listed in the Encyclopedia Galactica as the last major conflict before the rise of the Second Empire. Some Foundationists, however, distrust the Second Foundation and its members' Mule-like mental powers, and hope to find and destroy it. After inventing a device that can jam telepathic abilities and cause telepaths great pain, the Foundation finds and detains indefinitely about 50 telepaths on Terminus. The planet, the capital of the Foundation, is on the edge of the Milky Way. Since, as Arkady Darell puts it, \\"a circle has no end\\", then by tracing the disc of the galaxy around its edge, one would come back to Terminus. The Foundationists believe that, with the Second Foundation destroyed, the Seldon Plan will proceed without interference from telepaths. The telepaths were, however, nothing but martyrs taking part in a plot set by the Second Foundation to mislead the people of Terminus into thinking that the threat of the Second Foundation no longer existed, thus having the original Seldon Plan restored, while its location would remain a secret. The Second Foundation is actually located on Trantor‚Äîthe former capital of the Galactic Empire‚Äîin the center of the galaxy. It was called \\"Star's End\\" due to the ancient saying that \\"All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end\\". The location was also said to fit the \\"other end of the galaxy\\" location since the galaxy is not in fact a disc, but a spiral-- and from the edge, the other end of a spiral lies at the center. The book also noted that Hari Seldon was a social scientist, not a physical one. When the two Foundations were founded, they could be described as being at opposite social ends of the Galaxy, with Trantor at the very center of galactic power and prestige, and Terminus at the other extreme, something the First Foundation failed to realize because its members were inclined to analyze Seldon's statement in physical terms. Search by the Foundation was originally published in the November and December 1949 and January 1950 issues of Astounding Science Fiction under the title \\"...And Now You Don't\\". The Second Foundation would again be revisited in Foundation's Edge. White, Michael Asimov: The Unauthorised Life Reception On its initial publication, Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin described Second Foundation as \\"a thoroughly satisfying and adult play of the scientific imagination\\".Conklin, Groff (1953-11). \\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\". Galaxy Science Fiction, November 1953, p.79. Retrieved from https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1953-11/Galaxy_1953_11#page/n79/mode/2up. P. Schuyler Miller reported Second Foundation to be \\"good, sound, middle-of- the-road science fiction with a carefully hidden surprise\\".Miller, P. Schuyler (1954-06). \\"The Reference Library\\". Astounding Science Fiction, June 1954, p.141. The organization The Second Foundation was founded by Hari Seldon as a budding colony of psychologists and mentalics, people with telepathic abilities, located \\"at Star's End\\", an intentionally obscure term used by Seldon, which is later revealed to refer to the planet Trantor. In Forward the Foundation, the original Second Foundation is revealed to also include Hari's own granddaughter, Wanda Seldon, and his bodyguard Stettin Palver. The establishment, location and development of this Foundation was a secret, \\"drowned in silence\\" to increase its effectiveness and security. Whilst the First Foundation was strong in the physical sciences, the Second Foundation was strong in the mental sciences, including the continued development of psychohistory. Their function is to ensure that the Seldon plan comes to pass, both by refining the plan's contingencies to allow for even the most unlikely events, and to guard against unexpected developments, such as the Mule. Their eventual goal is to become the ruling class of the Second Empire in an effort to introduce mental sciences to humanity (whose benefits are, according to one Second Foundationer, less apparent, but longer lasting than physical sciences), while the First Foundation they manipulate forms the necessary political union. The Second Foundation are governed by a council of the strongest mentalics, called the Speakers. However, the name \\"Speaker\\" is a misnomer, because, being telepaths, the use of actual speech is quite unnecessary. The leader of the group is the First Speaker. The only formal power of the First Speaker was to speak first at meetings of the Speaker's Table, but in practice it conferred significantly more power. The structure of the Foundation is akin to both an intelligence network and a university. A complex of buildings on Trantor, the remnants of those saved from The Great Sack and those not demolished to provide metal for export, house a staff of technicians and analysts. Into these buildings flow reports from agents located in many parts of the Galaxy; these reports form the basis of any action that may be taken in furthering the aim of the Seldon Plan. The Second Foundation spreads a net over the galaxy to detect and recruit staff and agents. These are then specially trained over many years. Some become statistical technicians, but the best of the trainees are invited to commence an apprenticeship for Speakerhood.

The nobility of China was an important feature of the traditional social structure of Ancient China and Imperial China. While the concepts of hereditary sovereign and peerage titles and noble families were featured as early as the semi-mythical, early historical period, a settled system of nobility was established from the Zhou dynasty. In the subsequent millennia, this system was largely maintained in form, with some changes and additions, although the content constantly evolved. After the Song dynasty, most bureaucratic offices were filled though the imperial examination system, undermining the power of the hereditary aristocracy. The last, well-developed system of noble titles was established under the Qing dynasty. The Republican Revolution of 1911 ended the official imperial system. Though some noble families maintained their titles and dignity for a time, new political and economic circumstances forced their decline. Today, the nobility as a class has virtually disappeared. Sovereign and ruling family ranks Fuxi and Nuwa listed among the mythical earliest sovereigns of China Empress Dowager Cixi, Regent of China considered de facto sovereign of China for 47 years during AD 1861‚Äì1908 2 sisters concurrently spouses of the same the Guangxu Emperor (AD 1871‚Äì1908) are pictured in this image and the one immediately below: in this one Consort Zhen, popularly mislabelled with the lower-ranking title \\"Pearl Concubine\\" in English, his favorite, and her older sister... Consort Jin, on the left, older sister of Consort Zhen shown above, beside Empress Dowager Longyu on her right The apex of the nobility is the sovereign. The title of the sovereign has changed over time, together with the connotations of the respective titles. In Chinese history are generally 3 levels of supreme and fully independent sovereignty or high, significantly autonomous sovereignty above the next lower category of ranks, the aristocracy who usually recognized the overlordship of a higher sovereign or ruled a semi-independent, tributary, or independent realm of self-recognized insufficient importance in size, power, or influence to claim a sovereign title, such as a Duchy which in Western terms would be called a Duchy, Principality, or some level of Chiefdom. The broadest sovereign is what gets translated as the single term emperor in English. An emperor might appoint or confirm or tolerate subsovereigns or tributary rulers styled kings. As a title of nobility, Ba Wang, hegemon, recognized overlordship of several subordinate kings while refraining from claiming the title of emperor within the imperium of the Chinese subcontinent, such as its borders were considered from era to era. Sovereigns holding the title of king of an individual state within and without the shifting borders of the Chinese imperium might be fully independent heads of foreign nations, such as the King of Korea who might, in some cases, be subordinate to foreign emperors just as territorial or tribal sovereign Mongol khans might be subject to one of several Khagans or Great khans. Confusingly, some Chinese emperors styled many or all close male relatives of certain kinds such as brothers, uncles, or nephews as wang, a term for king, using it as a courtesy title. However, Chinese histories since ancient works such as Shiji were also fairly liberal in terming local tribal chiefs as \\"king\\" of a particular territory ranging from vast to tiny, using convenient terms of the form \\"(locality)\\" + \\"(king)\\" such as Changshawang, \\"King of Changsha\\" which was briefly recognized as a kingdom but was usually a smaller part of Chu state or just a county of the Sui dynasty state, or phrases such as Yiwang, \\"Yi (Eastern) Foreign ('barbarian') king(s),\\" while in other cases or by other authors other terms such as [tusi], \\"native chief\\" might be used for the same office. The downward extensibility of terms for \\"king\\" in more casual usage also influences other allusive uses of these terms. In modern colloquial Chinese the term \\"king\\" is sometimes also used, roughly as loosely as in English, for such non-literal terms as mien da wang, \\"great king of noodles\\" for a pasta-lover, where an English-speaker might use such terms as [King of the Road]. Family members of individual sovereigns were also born to titles or granted specific titles by the sovereign, largely according to family tree proximity, including blood relatives and in-laws and adoptees of predecessors and older generations of the sovereign. Frequently, the parents of a new dynasty-founding sovereign would become elevated with sovereign or ruling family ranks, even if this was already a posthumous act at the time of the dynasty-founding sovereign's accession. Titles translated in English as \\"prince\\" and \\"princess\\" were generally immediate or recent descendants of sovereigns, with increasing distance at birth from an ancestral sovereign in succeeding generations resulting in degradations of the particular grade of prince or princess and finally degradation of posterity's ranks as a whole below that of prince and princess. Sovereigns of smaller states are typically styled with lesser titles of aristocracy such as Duke of a Duchy or Marquis rather than as hereditary sovereign Princes who do not ascend to kingship as in the European case of the Principality of Monaco, and dynasties which gained or lost significant territory might change the titles of successive rulers from sovereign to aristocratic titles or vice versa, either by self-designation of the ruler or through imposed entitlement from a conquering state. For example, when Shu (state)'s kings were conquered by Qin (state), its Kaiming rulers became Marquises such as Marquis Hui of Shu who attempted a rebellion against Qin overlords in 301 BC. Imperium (emperor and ennobled family)  Emperor  Although formally Tianzi, \\"The Son of Heaven,\\" the power of the Chinese emperor varied between different emperors and different dynasties, with some emperors being absolute rulers and others being figureheads with actual power in the hands of court factions, eunuchs, the bureaucracy or noble families. * In the earliest, semi-mythical age, the sovereign was titled either huang (Chinese: Áöá hu√°ng) or di (Chinese: Â∏ù d√¨). Together, these rulers were called the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. For the lists of the earliest, mythological rulers, both titles are conventionally translated in English as \\"Sovereigns\\" though individual rulers entitled either huang or di from this period are translated in English with the title \\"Emperor\\" as these early mythological histories aim to feature the sovereigns of the evolving polity of the Chinese state, tracking those states which can best be claimed in a roughly continuous chain of imperial primacy interspersed with several periods of disunity such as the Spring and Autumn period, the Warring States Period, the Three Kingdoms Period, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period, the republican Chinese Civil War and so on. * The sovereigns during the Xia dynasty and Shang dynasty called themselves Di (Chinese: Â∏ù d√¨); rulers of these dynasties are conventionally translated with the title \\"king\\" and sometimes \\"emperor\\" in English even though the same term used in the mythologically previous dynasties is conventionally translated with the title \\"emperor\\" in English. * The sovereign during the Zhou dynasty called themselves Wang (Chinese: Áéã or ÂúãÁéã; w√°ng), before the Qin dynasty innovated the new term huangdi which would become the new standard term for \\"emperor.\\" The title \\"Wang\\" should not be confused with the common surname, which, at least by middle and later Chinese historical usage, has no definite royal implications. Rulers of these dynasties are conventionally translated with the title \\"king\\" and sometimes \\"emperor\\" in English. * Emperor or Huangdi (ÁöáÂ∏ù, pinyin: hu√°ng d√¨) was the title of the Chinese head of state of China from the Qin dynasty in 221 BC until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911. The first emperor of Qin (Qin Shi Huang) combined the two characters huang (Áöá \\"august, magnificent\\") and di (Â∏ù \\"God, Royal Ancestor\\") from the mythological tradition and the Xia and Shang dynasties to form the new, grander title \\"Huangdi\\". Since the Han dynasty, Huangdi began to be abbreviated to huang or di. The title of emperor was usually transmitted from father to son. Most often, the first-born son of the empress inherited the office, failing which the post was taken up by the first-born son of a concubine or consort of lower rank, but this rule was not universal and disputed succession was the cause of a number of civil wars. Unlike the case of Japan, the emperor's regime in traditional Chinese political theory allowed for a change in dynasty, and an emperor could be replaced by a rebel leader. This was because a successful rebel leader was believed to enjoy the Mandate of Heaven, while the deposed or defeated emperor had lost favour with the gods, and his mandate was over, a fact made apparent to all by his defeat.  Empress, consort, concubine and other imperial spouses  It was generally not accepted for a female to succeed to the throne as a sovereign regnant in her own right, rather than playing the role of a sovereign's consort or regent for a sovereign who was still a minor in age, so that in history of China there has only been one reigning empress, the Empress Wu, whose reign occurred during (and actually caused) an interregnum of the Tang dynasty. However, there have been numerous cases in Chinese history where a woman was the actual power behind the imperial throne (see √©minence grise). Hou, Empress, actually Empress Consort in English terms, was a title granted to an official primary spouse of the polygamous male Chinese Emperor, and for the mother of the Emperor, typically elevated to this rank of Empress Dowager, bearing a senior title such as Tai Hou, Grand Empress, regardless of which spousal ranking she bore prior to the emperor's accession. In practice, many Chinese Empress Dowagers, either as official regent for a sovereign who was still a minor in age or from the influence of position within family social ranks, wielded great power or is historically considered to have been the effective wielder of supreme power in China, as in the case of Empress Dowager Cixi, Regent of China considered de facto sovereign of China for 47 years during AD 1861‚Äì1908. Imperial Madams, ranking below Empress, aren't often distinguished in English from imperial Concubines, the next lower rank, but these were also titles of significance within the imperial household, and Imperial Madams might be translated as Consorts with the intention of distinguishing them from Empresses though all Empresses except the sole case of one Empress Regnant in Chinese history are technically Empress Consorts in English terms, primacy spouses of the Emperor Regnant who is actually invested with governmental rule. Zhou li, the Rites of Zhou, states that Emperors are entitled to the following simultaneous spouses: * 1 Empress (ÁöáÂêé) * 3 Madames or Consorts (Â§´‰∫∫) * 9 Imperial Concubines (Â¨™) * 27 Shifus (‰∏ñÂ©¶) * 81 Imperial Wives (Âæ°Â¶ª) Hegemony (hegemons and ennobled family) Sovereigns styled Ba Wang, hegemon, asserted official overlordship of several subordinate kings while refraining from claiming the title of emperor within the imperium of the Chinese subcontinent, such as its borders were considered from era to era, as in the case of Xiang Yu who styled himself Xƒ´ch«î B√†w√°ng, Western Chu Hegemon, appointing subordinate generals from his campaigns of conquest, including defeated ones, as Wang, kings of states within his hegemony. Royalty (kings and ennobled family) As noted above in the section discussing Emperors, the sovereigns during the Xia dynasty and Shang dynasty who called themselves Di (Chinese: Â∏ù d√¨) and during the Zhou dynasty who called themselves Wang (Chinese: Áéã or ÂúãÁéã; w√°ng), was the title of the Chinese head of state until the Qin dynasty. The title \\"Wang\\" should not be confused with the common surname, which, at least by middle and later Chinese historical usage, has no definite royal implications. Rulers of these dynasties are conventionally translated with the title \\"king\\" and sometimes \\"emperor\\" in English. Enfeoffing members of overthrown dynasties It was a custom in China for the new dynasty to ennoble and enfeoff a member of the dynasty which they overthrew with a title of nobility and a fief of land so that they could offer sacrifices to their ancestors, in addition to members of other preceding dynasties. This practice was referred to as \\"the two crownings and three respects.\\" When the Xia dynasty was overthrown by the Shang dynasty, Xia descendants were given a title and fiefs by the Shang King in the Qi (Henan), and Zeng (state). (The Kings of Yue (state) claimed to be a cadet branch of the Xia). When the Shang dynasty was overthrown by the Zhou dynasty, the Zhou King granted a Shang descendant the title of Duke and fief in the Song (state), and the Zhou King also reconfirmed the titles of the Xia descendants in the Qi and Zeng. Confucius was a descendant of the Shang Kings via the Song Dukes and Confucius' descendants held the hereditary title Duke Yansheng right to 1935. When the Yue (state) King Wujiang (ÁÑ°ÂΩä) was conquered by Chu (state), the Chu King enfeoffed Wujiang as Marquis of Ouyang Ting. When the Han dynasty Emperor Xian of Han was dethroned by the Cao Wei Emperor Cao Pi, Cao granted Emperor Xian the title Duke of Shanyang (Â±±ÈôΩÂÖ¨). His grandson Liu Kang (ÂäâÂ∫∑) inherited his dukedom, which lasted for 75 more years and two more dukes, Liu Jin (ÂäâÁëæ) and Liu Qiu (ÂäâÁßã), until the line was exterminated by invading Xiongnu tribes in about 309, during the Jin dynasty. The Emperors of Shu Han came from a cadet branch of the Han dynasty. When the Shu Han Emperor Liu Shan was defeated by Cao Wei, the Cao Wei enfeoffed Liu Shan as the \\"Duke of Anle\\" (ÂÆâÊ®ÇÂÖ¨; literally meaning \\"duke of peace and comfort\\") while his sons and grandsons became marquises. Liu Shan died in 271 in Luoyang, and was given the posthumous name \\"Duke Si of Anle\\" (ÂÆâÊ®ÇÊÄùÂÖ¨; literally \\"the deep-thinking duke of Anle\\"). His dukedom lasted several generations during Wei's successor state, the Jin Dynasty, before being extinguished in the turmoils caused by the Wu Hu. When the Eastern Wu was defeated by the Jin Dynasty, the Jin Emperor granted the Eastern Wu Emperor Sun Hao the title of \\"Marquis of Guiming\\". Sun Hao's sons were made junior officials in the Jin government. When the Jin Dynasty Emperor Gong of Jin was overthrown by the Liu Song Emperor Wu of Liu Song, Emperor Wu enfeoffed Emperor Gong as Prince of Lingling. However Emperor Gong was ordered killed. Sima Guang was a Jin Imperial family descendant who became a chancellor in the Song dynasty hundreds of years after the fall of the Jin. When the Liu Song Emperor Shun of Liu Song was overthrown by the Southern Qi Emperor Gao of Southern Qi, Emperor Gao enfeoffed Emperor Shun as Prince of Ruyin. However Emperor Shun was killed. When the Southern Qi Emperor He of Southern Qi was overthrown by the Liang dynasty Emperor Wu of Liang, Emperor Wu enfeoffed Emperor He as Prince of Baling. However Emperor He was killed. When the Liang dynasty Emperor Jing of Liang was overthrown by the Chen dynasty Emperor Wu of Chen, Emperor Wu enfeoffed Emperor Jing as Prince of Jiangyin. However Emperor Jing was killed. The Xianbei Tuoba royal family of Northern Wei started to arrange for Han Chinese elites to marry daughters of the royal family in the 480s. Some Han Chinese exiled royalty fled from southern China and defected to the Xianbei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei were married to Han Chinese elites, the Han Chinese Liu Song royal Liu Hui ÂàòËæâ, married Princess Lanling Ëò≠ÈôµÂÖ¨‰∏ª of the Northern Wei,. Princess Huayang ËèØÈôΩÂÖ¨‰∏ª to Sima Fei Âè∏È¶¨Êúè, a descendant of Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420) royalty, Princess Jinan ÊøüÂçóÂÖ¨‰∏ª to Lu Daoqian ÁõßÈÅìËôî, Princess Nanyang ÂçóÈò≥ÈïøÂÖ¨‰∏ª to Xiao Baoyin ËêßÂÆùÂ§§, a member of Southern Qi royalty. Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei's sister the Shouyang Princess was wedded to The Liang dynasty ruler Emperor Wu of Liang's son Xiao Zong Ëï≠Á∂ú. When the Eastern Jin dynasty ended Northern Wei received the Jin prince Sima Chuzhi Âè∏È¶¨Ê•ö‰πã as a refugee. A Northern Wei Princess married Sima Chuzhi, giving birth to Sima Jinlong Âè∏È¶¨ÈáëÈæç. Northern Liang King Juqu Mujian's daughter married Sima Jinlong. When the Northern Qi Emperor Gao Heng was overthrown by Northern Zhou Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou, Emperor Wu enfeoffed Emperor Gao Heng as Duke of Wen. However Gao Heng was killed. When the Northern Zhou Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou was overthrown by the Sui dynasty Emperor Wen of Sui, Emperor Wen enfeoffed Emperor Jing as Duke of Jie. However, he had all of close male clansmen of the duke‚Äîall grandsons of Emperor Jing's great-grandfather Yuwen Tai‚Äîput to death, as well as Emperor Jing's brothers Yuwen Kan (ÂÆáÊñáË°é) the Duke of Lai and Yuwen Shu (ÂÆáÊñáË°ì) the Duke of Yan. About three months later, Emperor Wen had the Duke of Jie secretly assassinated as well, but pretended to be shocked and declared a mourning period, and then buried him with honors due an emperor. The dukedom was passed to a distant relative, Yuwen Luo (ÂÆáÊñáÊ¥õ). When the Western Liang (Southern and Northern Dynasties) (Ë•øÊ¢Å) Emperor Jing of Western Liang was overthrown by the Sui dynasty Emperor Wen of Sui, Emperor Wen enfeoffed Emperor Jing as Duke of Ju (ËéíÂÖ¨) and then as Duke of Liang (Ê¢ÅÂÖ¨). His nephew Xiao Ju (Ëï≠ÈâÖ) inherited the title of Duke of Liang. When the Chen dynasty Emperor Chen Shubao was overthrown by the Sui dynasty Emperor Wen of Sui, Emperor Wen enfeoffed Chen Shubao as Duke Yang of Changcheng (Èï∑ÂüéÁÖ¨ÂÖ¨). The Tang dynasty Emperors claimed descent from the Dukes of Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms) (Ë•øÊ∂º) and posthumously gave them Imperial titles. When the Tang dynasty Emperor Ai of Tang was overthrown by the Later Liang Emperor Zhu Wen, Zhu Wen enfeoffed Emperor Ai as Prince of Jiyin. However Emperor Ai was killed. There were Dukedoms for the offspring of the royal families of the Zhou dynasty, Sui dynasty, and Tang dynasty in the Later Jin (Five Dynasties). When the Wuyue King Qian Chu surrendered to the Song dynasty the Song Emperor Taizong of Song raised the prefecture of Yangzhou to the nominal state of Huaihai, and installed Qian Chu as King of Huaihai. In 984, Qian Chu was made King of Hannan (a smaller nominal feoff) instead, and in 987 reduced again to King of Hanyang, with the right to take up residence in Hanyang, but then immediately additionally created Prince of Xu, with an enlarged fief. In 988, Qian Chu lost his title as king and was made Prince of Deng instead, with a larger nominal fief and actual income. When the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234) defeated the Liao dynasty and Northern Song Dynasty Emperor Tianzuo of Liao and Emperor Qinzong of Song were first enfeoffed with derogatory titles by the Jin, with Emperor Tianzuo becoming the Prince of Haibin Êµ∑Êª®Áéã (\\"Seashore Prince\\") and Emperor Qinzong becoming the Marquess of Chonghun (ÈáçÊòè, \\"Doubly muddled\\"); his father received a similarly derogatary-sounding title. In 1141, as the Jin relations with the Southern Song were about to normalized, Qinzong's captors granted him a neutrally-sounding title of the Duke (ÂÖ¨, gong) of Tianshui Jun, after a commandery in the upper reaches of the Wei River (now in Gansu), while his father (who had died in 1135) was posthumously styled the Prince of Tianshui Jun; a few months later he started receiving a stipend due to his rank.pp. 233‚Äì234. Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett. Alien Regimes and Border States, 907‚Äì1368 (Cambridge History of China, vol. 6). Cambridge University Press, 1994. . Liao royal family members who stayed in the Jin state like Yelu Lu and his son Yel√º Chucai served the Jin and then the Yuan dynasty as officials. Other members of the Khitan Liao royal family like Yel√º Dashi and Song Imperial family like Emperor Gaozong of Song both survived to rule the Kara-Khitan Khanate and Southern Song dynasty respectively. When the Kingdom of Dali was conquered by the Yuan dynasty, King Duan Xingzhi of Dali was then enfeoffed as Maharaja by the Yuan Emperor Kublai Khan. The Southern Song dynasty Emperor Gong of Song was enfeoffed as the Duke of Ying (ÁÄõÂúãÂÖ¨) by Kublai Khan, however, the Emperor Yingzong of Yuan ordered him to commit suicide. The Song Prince Zhao Yurui was enfeoffed with the title Duke of Pingyuan Canton (Âπ≥ÂéüÈÉ°ÂÖ¨) by Emperor Kublai Khan. Other Song Imperial family members like Zhao Mengfu and Zhao Yong were left alive by the Yuan. Zhao Yiguang was a Song Imperial family descendant who was a writer during the Ming dynasty. When the Ming dynasty fell and the Qing dynasty took over, the Qing Emperors granted a Ming descendant the title Marquis of Extended Grace and gave him a stipend to perform sacrifices to his ancestors, the Ming Emperors at the Ming Imperial Tombs. The Qing granted Zheng Keshuang of the Kingdom of Tungning the title of \\"Duke of Haicheng\\" (Êµ∑ÊæÑÂÖ¨) after he surrendered to the Qing. When the Northern Yuan Chahar Borjigin Mongol Khan Ejei Khan surrendered to the Qing, he was given the title of Prince of the first rank (Qin Wang, Ë¶™Áéã), a title he held until his death in 1661, and inherited by his younger brother Abunai (ÈòøÂ∏ÉÂ•à). Abunai openly showed his discontent toward the Manchu and he was put under house arrest in Shenyang by the Kangxi Emperor in 1669 and his imperial title / rank was given to his son Borni (Â∏ÉÂ∞îÂ∞º) in September of that same year. Borni (Â∏ÉÂ∞îÂ∞º) was careful to not show any sign of disrespecting the Qing Dynasty, but finally in 1675, he suddenly rebelled along with his younger brother Lubuzung (ÁΩóÂ∏ÉËóè), capitalizing on the Revolt of the Three Feudatories. However, they had made a serious miscalculation in wrongfully believing that other Mongols would join them, when in reality only three thousand Chahar (Mongols) joined the rebellion. It only took a single decisive battle on April 20, 1675 to defeat Abunai (ÈòøÂ∏ÉÂ•à) and his followers, who were all killed subsequently in their retreat. The Qing Dynasty's punishment of the rebellion was very harsh: all royal males of Chahar (Mongols) were executed, including infants born to Qing / Manchu princesses, and all royal females of Chahar (Mongols) were sold to slavery except these Qing / Manchu princesses. The Republic of China allowed the last Qing Emperor to stay in the Forbidden City and keep his title, treating him as a foreign monarch until 1924. The descendants of Confucius were maintained in the title of Duke Yansheng until 1935 when the title was changed to Sacrificial Official to Confucius (Â§ßÊàêËá≥ËÅñÂÖàÂ∏´Â•âÁ•ÄÂÆò), which remains as a position to this day, currently held by Kung Tsui-chang.

From Zhouli, later Confucian political philosophy and government publications, and from the surrounding historical literature of particular individuals, localities and events, the following social classifications have been attested. Honors and awards, and clan law, of the Zhou dynasty The social system of the Zhou dynasty is sometimes referred to as the Chinese proto-feudalism and was the combination of Fengjian (honors and awards) and Zongfa (clan law). Male subjects were classified into, in descending order of rank: *the nobles ‚Äì Zhuhou (Ë´∏‰æØ pinyin zh≈´ h√≥u), *the gentlemen ministers (of the royal court) ‚Äì Qing (Âçø qƒ´ng), *the gentlemen bureaucrats ‚Äì Daifu (Â§ßÂ§´ d√† f≈´) *the yeomen ‚Äì Shi (Â£´ sh√¨) *the commoners ‚Äì Shumin (Â∫∂Ê∞ë sh√π m√≠n). Zongfa (ÂÆóÊ≥ï, clan law), which applied to all social classes, governed the primogeniture of rank and succession of other siblings. The eldest son of the consort would inherit the title and retained the same rank within the system. Other sons from the consort, concubines and mistresses would be given titles one rank lower than their father. As time went by, all terms had lost their original meanings nonetheless. Qing (Âçø), Daifu (Â§ßÂ§´) and Shi (Â£´) became synonyms of court officials. Physicians were often called Daifu during the Late Imperial China. Referring to a male or self-reference of a male as Gongzi eventually became a way to raise one's mianzi (refer to Face (social concept)), and would indeed be considered flattery today. Peer ranks of the Zhou dynasty Under the Zhou dynasty were W«îdƒõngju√©w√®i (),http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?wdqr=%E4%BA%94%E7%AD%89%E7%88%B5%E4%BD%8D[wu3%20deng3%20jue2%20wei4]&wdrst;=0 five (aristocratic) peerage ranks (abbreviated W«îju√©) below the royal ranks in the following descending order from higher to lower rank:ChinaKnowledge.de encyclopedia, Male aristocracy * Duke (), which especially featured sovereign family members, though after changes of lines within an imperial or royal House or between dynasties, or through internal adoptions or coups, a duchy's current rulers might have been severed from current imperial or royal sovereigns and have become a distinct lineage of their own; high dukes might be styled, though not explicit \\"royal dukes\\" as in the English peerage. A Chinese royal duke might be a clan prince or (courtesy title) family \\"king\\" under the emperor while simultaneously holding a Duchy, whether enfoeffed with land or without portfolio. A character whose fundamental meaning is \\"public\\", g≈çng is also used in titles, ordinary names, and honorific names including deified stylings in ways other than indicating the peerage rank of duke. * Marquis (), usually with the same emphasis on being a national borderland march lord as with the European title marquess. * Count () * Viscount (), which is also extensively used in Chinese nicknames as the meaning of the character is \\"child,\\" as well as in courtesy names and honorific names in which context the character came to mean \\"master\\" as in Kongfuzi or Kongzi, Confucius, Master of surname Kung, or the Daoist patriarch Laozi, Old Master. * Baron (), which is also used outside of its use as a peerage term to indicate male gender in individual names and in classifications such as \\"men\\", as the character's fundamental meaning is \\"male\\". Female aristocracy Titles of female members of the aristocracies varied in different dynasties and eras, each having unique classifications for the spouses of the emperor. Any female member excluding a spouse of an emperor can be called a princess or g≈çngzh«î (ÂÖ¨‰∏ª), and incorporated her associated place into her title if she had one. Other titles and honorifics Besides the systematized ranks listed above, there were also other familial appellations used as titles, e.g. Shu (Âèî, paternal younger uncle) or Jiu (ËàÖ, maternal uncle). Sons of kings who did not receive other titles were generically called Wangzi (ÁéãÂ≠ê, king's son), and their children Wangsun (ÁéãÂ≠´, king's grandson). Similarly, sons and grandsons of dukes and lords are called Gongzi (ÂÖ¨Â≠ê, duke's son) and Gongsun (ÂÖ¨Â≠´, duke's grandson). These honorifics occasionally became heritable titles, no longer indicating relation with the reigning king. And some clans even took them as family names. Gongzi eventually evolved into the generic honorific for all young gentry. Today it is either used as a flattering way to address an interlocutor's son, or an pejorative term for a wealthy man. Wangzi, on the other hand, is used today as the generic translation for foreign princes (in the sense of a monarch's son, as opposed to a sui generis title). Chu nobility The southern state of Chu had a notably distinct culture from the central plain states, including the nobility system. The royal Xiong clan and its collateral branches of Qu, Jing and Zhao formed the main aristocracy of Chu. Besides the royal clans, Chu did not have a system of nobility early on.Á©ÄÊ¢Å‰º†¬∑ÂÉñÂÖ¨ÂõõÂπ¥ Chu's formal system of rank only appeared around the late Spring and Autumn period, with such titles as Tonghou (ÈÄö‰æØ, lit. marquis-peer), Zhigui (Âü∑Áè™, lit. jade scepter bearer), Zhibo (Âü∑Â∏õ, lit. silk bearer). Noble ranks come with a state stipend, and holders of the highest ranks also received fiefs and the honorific title Jun (Âêõ, lord), e.g. Lord Chunshen. Noble titles in Chu were bestowed primarily as reward for military and civil service, and were not heritable in principle. Prior to the systematization of ranks in early Han dynasty, Liu Bang, being of Chu origin, also awarded distinctly Chu titles. After Zhou dynasty  Qin and Han dynasty  Prior to the Qin dynasty, Wang (sovereign) was the title for the ruler of whole China. Under him were the vassals or Zhuhou (Ë´∏‰æØ), who held territories granted by a succession of Zhou dynasty kings. They had the duty to support the Zhou king during an emergency and were ranked according to the Five Orders of Nobility. In the Spring and Autumn period, the Zhou kings had lost most of their powers, and the most powerful vassals became the de facto ruler of China. Finally, in the Warring States period, most vassals declared themselves Wang or kings, and regarded themselves as equal to the Zhou king. After Zheng, king of the state of Qin, later known as Qin Shi Huang, defeated all the other vassals and unified China, he adopted the new title of Huangdi (emperor). Qin Shi Huang eliminated noble titles, as he sponsored legalism which believed in merit, not birth. He forced all nobles to the capital, seized their lands and turned them into administrative districts with the officials ruling them selected on merit. After the demise of Qin Er Shi, the last Qin ruler to use the title Huangdi (his successor Ziying used the title King of Qin rather than Emperor), Xiang Yu styled himself Hegemon King of Western Chu (Xichu B√†w√°ng Ë•øÊ•öÈú∏Áéã) rather than Emperor. Xiang Yu gave King Huai II of Chu the title of Emperor of Chu (Ê•öÁæ©Â∏ù) or The Righteous Emperor of Southern Chu (ÂçóÊ•öÁæ©Â∏ù) and awarded the rest of his allies, including Liu Bang, titles and a place to administer. Xiang Yu gave Liu Bang the Principality of Han, and he would soon replace him as the ruler of China. The founder of the Han dynasty, Liu Bang, continued to use the title Huangdi. In order to appease his wartime allies, he gave each of them a piece of land as their own \\"kingdom\\" (Wangguo) along with a title of Wang. He eventually killed all of them and replaced them with members of his family. These kingdoms remained effectively independent until the Rebellion of the Seven States. Since then, Wang became merely the highest hereditary title, which roughly corresponded to the title of prince, and, as such, was commonly given to relatives of the emperor. The title Gong also reverted purely to a peerage title, ranking below Wang. Those who bore such titles were entirely under the auspices of the emperor, and had no ruling power of their own. The two characters combined to form the rank, Wanggong, grew to become synonymous with all higher court officials. The title of Duke of Song and \\"Duke Who Continues and Honours the Yin\\" (ÊÆ∑Á¥πÂòâÂÖ¨) were bestowed upon Kong An Â≠îÂÆâ (Êù±Êº¢) by the Eastern Han dynasty because he was part of the Shang dynasty's legacy. This branch of the Confucius family is a separate branch from the line that held the title of Marquis of Fengsheng village and later Duke Yansheng. The Han dynasty bestowed the hereditary title Âë®Â≠êÂçóÂêõ upon the Zhou dynasty royal descendant Ji Jia Âß¨Âòâ and his descendants.„ÄäÊ±â‰π¶¬∑Êù®ËÉ°Êú±Ê¢Ö‰∫ë‰º†„ÄãÔºöÂàùÔºåÊ≠¶Â∏ùÊó∂ÔºåÂßãÂ∞ÅÂë®ÂêéÂß¨Âòâ‰∏∫Âë®Â≠êÂçóÂêõÔºåËá≥ÂÖÉÂ∏ùÊó∂ÔºåÂ∞äÂë®Â≠êÂçóÂêõ‰∏∫Âë®Êâø‰ºë‰æØÔºå‰ΩçÊ¨°ËØ∏‰æØÁéã„ÄÇ‰ΩøËØ∏Â§ßÂ§´ÂçöÂ£´Ê±ÇÊÆ∑ÂêéÔºåÂàÜÊï£‰∏∫ÂçÅ‰ΩôÂßìÔºåÈÉ°ÂõΩÂæÄÂæÄÂæóÂÖ∂Â§ßÂÆ∂ÔºåÊé®Ê±ÇÂ≠êÂ≠ôÔºåÁªù‰∏çËÉΩÁ∫™„ÄÇÊó∂ÔºåÂå°Ë°°ËÆÆÔºå‰ª•‰∏∫‚ÄúÁéãËÄÖÂ≠ò‰∫åÁéãÂêéÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•Â∞äÂÖ∂ÂÖàÁéãËÄåÈÄö‰∏âÁªü‰πü„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÁäØËØõÁªù‰πãÁΩ™ËÄÖÁªùÔºåËÄåÊõ¥Â∞Å‰ªñ‰∫≤‰∏∫ÂßãÂ∞ÅÂêõÔºå‰∏äÊâøÂÖ∂ÁéãËÄÖ‰πãÂßãÁ•ñ„ÄÇ„ÄäÊò•Áßã„Äã‰πã‰πâÔºåËØ∏‰æØ‰∏çËÉΩÂÆàÂÖ∂Á§æÁ®∑ËÄÖÁªù„ÄÇ‰ªäÂÆãÂõΩÂ∑≤‰∏çÂÆàÂÖ∂ÁªüËÄåÂ§±ÂõΩÁü£ÔºåÂàôÂÆúÊõ¥Á´ãÊÆ∑Âêé‰∏∫ÂßãÂ∞ÅÂêõÔºåËÄå‰∏äÊâøÊ±§ÁªüÔºåÈùûÂΩìÁªßÂÆã‰πãÁªù‰æØ‰πüÔºåÂÆúÊòéÂæóÊÆ∑ÂêéËÄåÂ∑≤„ÄÇ‰ªä‰πãÊïÖÂÆãÔºåÊé®Ê±ÇÂÖ∂Â´°Ôºå‰πÖËøú‰∏çÂèØÂæóÔºõËôΩÂæóÂÖ∂Â´°ÔºåÂ´°‰πãÂÖàÂ∑≤ÁªùÔºå‰∏çÂΩìÂæóÁ´ã„ÄÇ„ÄäÁ§ºËÆ∞„ÄãÂ≠îÂ≠êÊõ∞Ôºö‚Äò‰∏òÔºåÊÆ∑‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ‚ÄôÂÖàÂ∏àÊâÄÂÖ±‰º†ÔºåÂÆú‰ª•Â≠îÂ≠ê‰∏ñ‰∏∫Ê±§Âêé„ÄÇ‚Äù‰∏ä‰ª•ÂÖ∂ËØ≠‰∏çÁªèÔºåÈÅÇËßÅÂØù„ÄÇ Family tree of Chinese nobility from the Han dynasty to the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

Celestial Masters and the nobility of northern China subdued the nobility of southern China during the Eastern Jin and Western Jin in Jiangnan in particular. The most populous region of China was southern China after the depopulation of the north and the migration of northern Chinese to southern China. Different waves of migration of aristocratic Chinese from northern China to the south at different times resulted in distinct groups of lineages, with some lineages arriving in the 300s-400s and others in the 800s-900s. All ethnicities who were of the literati were possibly called Haner because ethnic Xianbei were referred to as \\"damned Chinese\\" by the Northern Qi. Appearing as culturally Xianbei and at the same time declaring Han Chinese ancestry was done by Gao Huan and the Han family. The Han Chinese Gao family of Bohai (Ê∏§Êµ∑È´òÊ∞è(The Eastern Han dynasty era Bohai prefecture)) was claimed by Gao Huan as his ancestors. Of Han Chinese background who was Xianbeified, he was raised in Huaishuozhen while his family came from Bohai prefecture in modern Hebei. He became Xianbeified since his clan was raised in Inner Mongolia after being relocated from what is modern Hebei (Bohai) where his Han Chinese ancestors lived. Honorary Bohai descent was bestowed upon Gao Longshi by Gao Huan. Bohai was asserted as the ancestral home of Gao Huan by Gao Huan. Huaibei was the source of the Zhou of Runan Ê±ùÂçóÂë®Ê∞è who were part of the Eastern Jin dynasty. The Linghu of Dunhuang Êï¶ÁÖå‰ª§ÁãêÊ∞è were descended from King Wen of Zhou through his son Duke Gao of Bi Áï¢ÂÖ¨È´ò. The Yan of Langye ÁêÖÈÇ™È°èÊ∞è spawned Yan Zhitui.

A fief of 100 households and the rank of Â¥áËÅñ‰æØ Marquis who worships the sage was bestowed upon a Confucius descendant, Yan Hui's lineage had 2 of its scions and Confucius's lineage had 4 of its scions who had ranks bestowed on them in Shandong in 495 and a fief of ten households and rank of Â¥áËÅñÂ§ßÂ§´ Grandee who venerates the sage was bestowed on Â≠î‰πò Kong Sheng who was Confucius's scion in the 28th generation in 472 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. Despite the massacre Cui Hao's clan, the Cui clan of Qinghe survived into the Tang dynasty. Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty Northwestern aristocracy The northwest military aristocracy was where the Sui dynasty Emperors originated from and they emphasized that their patrilineal ancestry was ethnic Han, claiming descent from the Han official Yang Zhen.'Book of Sui, vol. 1 and the New Book of Tang traced his patrilineal ancestry to the Zhou dynasty kings via the Dukes of Jin.New Book of Tang, :zh:s:Êñ∞ÂîêÊõ∏ The Sui Emperors had maternal Xianbei ancestry from a woman of the Xianbei Dugu family. The Guanzhong noble families of Han Chinese background married the Northern Zhou Xianbei Yuwen family.

The Tang Emperors had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother Duchess Dugu. Ancient Han ancestry was asserted by the Tang and Sui Emperors. The northeastern Chinese aristocracy during the Sui-Tang period was of pure Han blood, while they looked down upon the northwestern aristocracy which was of mixed Han and Xianbei blood.

The northwestern aristocracy was countered by the northeastern aristocracy who were supported by the Sui Yangdi Emperor. There was not necessarily unity on political positions within both the northeastern and northwestern aristocracies. During the Tang dynasty, nobles lost most of their power to the mandarins when imperial examination replaced the nine-rank system. The Anding origin noble Liang family produced Liang Su, a Confucian scholar. An anti-meritocratic pro-aristocratic faction was led by Li Linfu. Northeastern aristocracy Power was held in a large degree by Han Chinese noble families of the Central Plains-based Northern Qi and Eastern Wei in the northeastern area. A \\"marriage ban\\" was applied to the northeastern aristocracy.

Moriya Mitsuo wrote a history of the Later Han-Tang period of the Taiyuan Wang. Among the strongest families was the Taiyuan Wang. The prohibition on marriage between the clans issued in 659 by the Gaozong Emperor was flouted by the seven families since a woman of the Boling Cui married a member of the Taiyuan Wang, giving birth to the poet Wang Wei. He was the son of Wang Chulian who in turn was the son of Wang Zhou. The marriages between the families were performed clandestinely after the prohibition was implemented on the seven families by Gaozong. The Zhou dynasty King Ling's son Prince Jin is assumed by most to be the ancestor of the Taiyuan Wang. The Longmen Wang were a cadet line of the Zhou dynasty descended Taiyuan Wang, and Wang Yan and his grandson Wang Tong hailed from his cadet line. Both Buddhist monks and scholars hailed from the Wang family of Taiyuan such as the monk Tanqian. The Wang family of Taiyuan included Wang Huan. Their status as \\"Seven Great surnames\\" became known during Gaozong's rule. The Taiyuan Wang family produced Wang Jun who served under Emperor Huai of Jin. A Fuzhou-based section of the Taiyuan Wang produced the Buddhist monk Baizhang.

The Zheng family of Xingyang ÊªéÈôΩÈÑ≠Ê∞è claim descent from the Zhou dynasty Kings via the rulers of the State of Zheng. The Marquis of Xingyang rank was created for Zheng Xi. The Xingyang Zheng spawned Zheng Daozhao and Zheng Xi. Zheng Wanjun was a member of the Xingyang Zheng. The Xingyang Zheng spawned Zheng Yuzhong (Zheng Qiao). The Xingyang Zheng spawned Zheng Jiong. The Zheng of Xingyang may have been miswritten in the records as the Zheng of Rongyang. The bigger Longxi Li lineage outside of the Tang Imperial family has prominent members like Li Jiongxiu, Li Yiyan, Li Kui (chancellor), Li Wei (Tang dynasty), Li Fengji, Li Zhongyan, Li Jing (Tang dynasty), Li Zhaode, and Li Bai. Cui Qun was part of the Cui clan of Qinghe. The Tang Longxi lineage also included sub lineages like the Guzang Li (ÂßëËáßÊùé), from which Li Zhuanmei ÊùéÂ∞àÁæé came from. The Zhaojun Li were written about by David Johnson while the Cui of Boling were written about by Patricia Ebrey. The cadet Canhuang Li were part of the Li of Zhaojun.

The Song dynasty Emperors hailed from the Guandong Zhao while the Longxi Li produced the Tang Emperors. The seven clans were divided into a further 44 sub branches. The Li of Zhaojun and the Lu of Fanyang hailed from Shandong and were related to the Liu clan which was also linked to the Yang of Hongnong and other clans of Guanlong. The Li of Zhaojun, Lu of Fanyang, Zheng of Yingyang ÊªéÈôΩÈÑ≠Ê∞è were of Shandong origin like the Wang of Taiyuan. The Yang of Hongnong ÂºòËæ≤Ê•äÊ∞è were asserted as ancestors by the Sui Emperors like the Longxi Li's were asserted as ancestors of the Tang Emperors.

The Zhou of Runan Ê±ùÂçóÂë®Ê∞è lived on after the Tang dynasty's collapse. Meng Haoran and Meng Jiao were descendants of Mencius who lived during the Tang dynasty. After Tang dynasty Some Song dynasty families were descended from Tang era nobility. Some of the Tang dynasty Imperial family's cadet branches ended up in Fujian- one founded by Li Dan Êùé‰∏π which became prominent in the Song dynasty. another founded by Li Fu ÊùéÂØå also becoming prominent during the Song dynasty. The Tang Longxi lineage also included sub lineages like the Guzang Li ÂßëËáßÊùé, from which Li Zhuanmei ÊùéÂ∞àÁæé came from, who served the Later Jin. Descendants of the Tang Emperors live in Chengcun village near the Wuyi mountains in Fujian. Subsequent dynasties expanded the hereditary titles further. Not all titles of peerage are hereditary, and the right to continue the heredity passage of a very high title was seen as a very high honour; at the end of the Qing dynasty, there were five grades of princes, amongst a myriad of other titles. For details, see Qing dynasty nobility. A few Chinese families enjoyed hereditary titles in the full sense, the chief among them being the Holy Duke of Yen (the descendant of Confucius); others, such as the lineal descendants of Wen Tianxiang, ennobled the Duke of Xingguo, not choosing to use their hereditary title. When the Ming dynasty emerged Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's military officers who served under him were given noble titles which privileged the holder with a stipend but in all other aspects was merely symbolic. (ÂäüËá£‰∏ñË°®) Mu Ying's family was among them. Special rules against abuse of power were implemented on the nobles. Zengzi was a descendant of the Xia dynasty Kings through Shao Kang.„ÄäÂÆóËÅñÂøó„ÄãÔºåÔºàÊ∏ÖÔºâÊõæÂúãËçÉÁ∫å‰øÆÔºåÂÆóËÅñÂ•âÁ•ÄÂÆòÂ∫úÔºå1974Âπ¥„ÄäÊ≠¶ÂüéÊõæÊ∞èÈáç‰øÆÊóèË≠ú„ÄãÔºåÔºàÊ∏ÖÔºâÊõæÁπÅÂ¢´Á∫ÇÔºå1807Âπ¥ Duke Huan of Lu's son through Qingfu (ÊÖ∂Áà∂) was the ancestor of Mencius.

Zhang Zai's offspring received the appointment as wujing boshi along with Zhu Xi's, Cheng Hao's, Cheng Yi's, and Zhou Dunyi's offspring. Biographies of those who were awarded the title of Wujing Boshi in the Ming dynasty are found in Volume 284, Biographies 172 of the History of Ming (ÊòéÂè≤). The Imperial Clansmen consisted of those who trace their descent direct from the founder of the Qing dynasty, and were distinguished by the privilege of wearing a yellow girdle; collateral relatives of the imperial house wore a red girdle. Twelve degrees of nobility (in a descending scale as one generation succeeds another) were conferred on the descendants of every emperor; in the thirteenth generation the descendants of emperors were merged in the general population, save that they retain the yellow girdle. The heads of eight houses, the Iron-capped (or helmeted) princes, maintained their titles in perpetuity by rule of primogeniture in virtue of having helped the Manchu conquest of China. The title Wujing boshi ‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´ was created in the Han dynasty. Holders of the title were considered part of Hanlin Academy. Confucian sages (Disciples of Confucius and Neo Confucian scholars) offspring were granted the office of \\"Wujing Boshi\\" (‰∫îÁªèÂçöÂ£´; ‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´; W«îjƒ´ng B√≥sh√¨).

The descendants of the Four Sages ÂõõÊ∞è, Confucius, Mencius, Zengzi, and Yan Hui still use generation poems for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors. Â≠îÂßì (The Kong family, descendants of Confucius) Â≠üÂßì (The Meng family, descendants of Mencius) The Qing appointed the Ming imperial descendants to the title of Marquis of Extended Grace.

Êù±ÈáéÂÆ∂ÊóèÂ§ßÂÆó‰∏ñÁ≥ª Family Tree of the descendants of the Duke of Zhou in Chinese One of the Duke of Zhou's 72 generation descendants family tree was examined and commented on by Song Lian. The Zhikou (Chikow) Chiangs such as Chiang Kai-shek were descended from Chiang Shih-chieh who during the 1600s (17th century) moved there from Fenghua district, whose ancestors in turn came to southeastern China's Zhejiang (Chekiang) province after moving out of Northern China in the 13th century AD. The 12th century BC Duke of Zhou's (Duke of Chou) third son (ÁÆ°ÂèîÈÆÆ) was the ancestor of the Chiangs. The oldest held continuous noble title in Chinese history was that held by the descendants of Confucius, as Duke Yansheng, which was renamed as the Sacrificial Official to Confucius in 1935 by the Republic of China. The title is held by Kung Tsui-chang. Han defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were often given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General Li Yongfang ÊùéÊ∞∏Ëä≥ after he surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchu in 1618. http://www.lishiquwen.com/news/7356.html http://www.75800.com.cn/lx2/pAjRqK/9N6KahmKbgWLa1mRb1iyc_.html https://read01.com/aP055D.html The offspring of Li received the \\"Third Class Viscount\\" () title. Li Yongfang was the great great great grandfather of Li Shiyao Êùé‰æçÂ†Ø.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/LI_SHIH-YAO.html Upon the surrender of Zheng Keshuang he received the title of Duke Haicheng from the Qing and his follower Feng Xifan received the title of Count Zhongcheng. Shi Lang received the title of Marquis Jinghai from the Qing. Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang received the title of Marquis from the Qing. Zeng Guofan was a descendant of Zengzi through a cadet branch. Most titles of nobility were officially abolished when China became a republic in 1912, with the Republic maintaining some titles like Duke Yansheng. They were briefly expanded under Yuan Shikai's empire and after Zhang Xun's coup. The last emperor was allowed to keep his title but was treated as a foreign monarch until the 1924 coup. Manchukuo also had titles of nobility. The bestowal of titles was abolished upon the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The families of the descendants of the Four Sages ÂõõÊ∞è still hold hereditary offices in the Republic of China (Taiwan) such as the Sacrificial Official to Confucius, \\"Sacrificial Official to Mencius\\", \\"Sacrificial Official to Zengzi\\", and \\"Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui\\".http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-07/24/content_11764658.htmhttp://blog.xuite.net/ahhsiang/TYDA/20446373-„ÄêÊñáÂè≤ÈõúË®ò„ÄëÂ§ßÊàêËá≥ËÅñÂÖàÂ∏´Â•âÁ•ÄÂÆò The modern purported descendants of Cao Cao were authenticated with Y chromosome DNA testing, since the remains of Cao Cao's granduncle provided Y chromosome O2*-M268 which matched that of the claimed descendants. Han and Manchu clothing coexisted during Qing dynasty Han Chinese clothing in early Qing A common misconception among Han Chinese was that Manchu clothing was entirely separate from Hanfu. In fact, Manchu clothes were simply modified Ming Hanfu but the Manchus promoted the misconception that their clothing was of different origin. Manchus originally did not have their own cloth or textiles and the Manchus had to obtain Ming dragon robes and cloth when they paid tribute to the Ming dynasty or traded with the Ming. These Ming robes were modified, cut and tailored to be narrow at the sleeves and waist with slits in the skirt to make it suitable for falconry, horse riding and archery. The Ming robes were simply modified and changed by Manchus by cutting it at the sleeves and waist to make them narrow around the arms and waist instead of wide and added a new narrow cuff to the sleeves. The new cuff was made out of fur. The robe's jacket waist had a new strip of scrap cloth put on the waist while the waist was made snug by pleating the top of the skirt on the robe. The Manchus added sable fur skirts, cuffs and collars to Ming dragon robes and trimming sable fur all over them before wearing them. Han Chinese court costume was modified by Manchus by adding a ceremonial big collar (da-ling) or shawl collar (pijian-ling). It was mistakenly thought that the hunting ancestors of the Manchus skin clothes became Qing dynasty clothing, due to the contrast between Ming dynasty clothes unshaped cloth's straight length contrasting to the odd-shaped pieces of Qing dynasty long pao and chao fu. Scholars from the west wrongly thought they were purely Manchu. Chao fu robes from Ming dynasty tombs like the Wanli emperor's tomb were excavated and it was found that Qing chao fu was similar and derived from it. They had embroidered or woven dragons on them but are different from long pao dragon robes which are a separate clothing. Flaired skirt with right side fastenings and fitted bodices dragon robes have been found in Beijing, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Shandong tombs of Ming officials and Ming imperial family members. Integral upper sleeves of Ming chao fu had two pieces of cloth attached on Qing chao fu just like earlier Ming chao fu that had sleeve extensions with another piece of cloth attached to the bodice's integral upper sleeve. Another type of separate Qing clothing, the long pao resembles Yuan dynasty clothing like robes found in the Shandong tomb of Li Youan during the Yuan dynasty. The Qing dynasty chao fu appear in official formal portraits while Ming dynasty Chao fu that they derive from do not, perhaps indicating the Ming officials and imperial family wore chao fu under their formal robes since they appear in Ming tombs but not portraits. Qing long pao were similar unofficial clothing during the Qing dynasty. The Yuan robes had hems flared and around the arms and torso they were tight. Qing unofficial clothes, long pao, derived from Yuan dynasty clothing while Qing official clothing, chao fu, derived from unofficial Ming dynasty clothing, dragon robes. The Ming consciously modeled their clothing after that of earlier Han Chinese dynasties like the Song dynasty, Tang dynasty and Han dynasty. In Japan's Nara city, the Todaiji temple's Shosoin repository has 30 short coats (hanpi) from Tang dynasty China. Ming dragon robes derive from these Tang dynasty hanpi in construction. The hanpi skirt and bodice are made of different cloth with different patterns on them and this is where the Qing chao fu originated. Cross-over closures are present in both the hanpi and Ming garments. The eighth century Shosoin hanpi's variety show it was in vogue at the tine and most likely derived from much more ancient clothing. Han dynasty and Jin dynasty (266‚Äì420) era tombs in Yingban, to the Tianshan mountains south in Xinjiang have clothes resembling the Qing long pao and Tang dynasty hanpi. The evidence fron excavated tombs indicates that China had a long tradition of garments that led to the Qing chao fu and it was not invented or introduced by Manchus in the Qing dynasty or Mongols in the Yuan dynasty. The Ming robes that the Qing chao fu derived from were just not used in portraits and official paintings but were deemed as high status to be buried in tombs. In some cases the Qing went further than the Ming dynasty in imitating ancient China to display legitimacy with resurrecting ancient Chinese rituals to claim the Mandate of Heaven after studying Chinese classics. Qing sacrificial ritual vessels deliberately resemble ancient Chinese ones even more than Ming vessels. Tungusic people on the Amur river like Udeghe, Ulchi and Nanai adopted Chinese influences in their religion and clothing with Chinese dragons on ceremonial robes, scroll and spiral bird and monster mask designs, Chinese New Year, using silk and cotton, iron cooking pots, and heated house from China during the Ming dynasty. The Spencer Museum of Art has six long pao robes that belonged to Han Chinese nobility of the Qing dynasty. Ranked officials and Han Chinese nobles had two slits in the skirts while Manchu nobles and the Imperial family had 4 slits in skirts. All first, second and third rank officials as well as Han Chinese and Manchu nobles were entitled to wear 9 dragons by the Qing Illustrated Precedents. Qing sumptuary laws only allowed four clawed dragons for officials, Han Chinese nobles and Manchu nobles while the Qing Imperial family, emperor and princes up to the second degree and their female family members were entitled to wear five clawed dragons. However officials violated these laws all the time and wore 5 clawed dragons and the Spencer Museum's 6 long pao worn by Han Chinese nobles have 5 clawed dragons on them. Han Chinese general Zhang Zhiyuan wearing Qing military outfit. Traditional Ming dynasty Hanfu robes given by the Ming Emperors to the Chinese noble Dukes Yansheng descended from Confucius are still preserved in the Confucius Mansion after over five centuries. Robes from the Qing emperors are also preserved there. The Jurchens in the Jin dynasty and Mongols in the Yuan dynasty continued to patronize and support the Confucian Duke Yansheng. List of people granted peerage by Yuan Shikai as self-proclaimed emperor (1915‚Äì1916) After the fall of the Qing dynasty and its \\"Last Emperor\\" Puyi in the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, Chinese President Yuan Shikai attempted to resurrect the imperial system, proclaiming himself emperor in his brief Empire of China (1915‚Äì1916) which ended with his death 83 days after its inauguration. During this period, Yuan Shikai as sovereign declared the ennoblement of several people, in this case not so much his family and clan as allies and those he sought as supporters for the new Empire. Some declined the honors. Prince of the First Rank Wuyi (Ê≠¶Áæ©Ë¶™Áéã W«îy√¨ qƒ´n w√°ng) Feng Yuxiang, made Baron of the Third Rank by Yuan Shikai who proclaimed himself Emperor in 1915, just five years after Yuan Shikai had imprisoned him as a rebel and stripped his military rank; sent to fight for Yuan Shikai with his new noble title and a new military rank, Feng Yuxiang communicated with the enemy and was stripped of military rank a second time. *Li Yuanhong *Duke Yansheng Kong Lingyi Dukes of the First Rank (‰∏ÄÁ≠âÂÖ¨ Yƒ´ dƒõng g≈çng) *Long Jiguang (ÈæçÊøüÂÖâ) *Zhang Xun *Feng Guozhang *Jiang Guiti (ÂßúÊ°ÇÈ°å) *Duan Zhigui *Ni Sichong *Liu Guanxiong Marquesses of the First Rank (‰∏ÄÁ≠â‰æØ Yƒ´ dƒõng h√≥u) *Tang Xiangming (ÊπØËñåÈäò) *Li Chun (ÊùéÁ¥î) *Zhu Rui (Êú±Áëû) *Lu Rongting *Zhao Ti (Ë∂ôÂÄú) *Chen Yi *Tang Jiyao *Yan Xishan *Wang Zhanyuan (ÁéãÂç†ÂÖÉ) *Lui Kang Counts of the First Rank (‰∏ÄÁ≠â‰ºØ Yƒ´ dƒõng b√≥) *Zhang Xiluan (ÂºµÈå´Èëæ) *Zhu Jiabao (Êú±ÂÆ∂ÂØ∂) *Zhang Mingqi (ÂºµÈ≥¥Â≤ê) *Tian Wenlie (Áî∞ÊñáÁÉà) *Jin Yunpeng *Yang Zengxin (Ê•äÂ¢ûÊñ∞) *Lu Jianzhang (Èô∏Âª∫Á´†) *Meng Enyuan (Â≠üÊÅ©ÈÅ†) *Qu Yinguang (Â±àÊò†ÂÖâ) *Qi Yaolin (ÈΩäËÄÄÁê≥) *Cao Kun *Yang Shande (Ê•äÂñÑÂæ∑) Viscounts of the First Rank (‰∏ÄÁ≠âÂ≠ê Yƒ´ dƒõng z«ê) *Zhu Qinglan (Êú±ÊÖ∂ÁÄæ) *Zhang Guangjian (ÂºµÂª£Âª∫) *Li Houji (ÊùéÂéöÂü∫) *Liu Xianshi (ÂäâÈ°Ø‰∏ñ) Barons of the First Rank (‰∏ÄÁ≠âÁî∑ Yƒ´ dƒõng n√°n) *Ma Anliang (È¶¨ÂÆâËâØ) *Xu Shiying (Ë®±‰∏ñËã±) *Qi Yang (ÊàöÊèö) *Ren Kecheng (‰ªªÂèØÊæÑ) *Wang Yitang (ÁéãÊèñÂîê) *He Zonglian (‰ΩïÂÆóËìÆ) *Zhang Huaizhi (ÂºµÊá∑Ëäù) *Long Jinuang (ÈæçË¶≤ÂÖâ) *Chen Bingkun *Lu Yongxiang (ÁõßÊ∞∏Á••) *L√º Diaoyuan (ÂëÇË™øÂÖÉ) *Jin Yong (ÈáëÊ∞∏) *Cai Rukai (Ëî°ÂÑíÊ•∑) *Duan Shuyun (ÊÆµÊõ∏Èõ≤) *Long Jianzhang (ÈæçÂª∫Á´†) *Shen Jinjian (Ê≤àÈáëÈëë) *Pan Juying (ÊΩòÁü©Ê•π) Baron of the Third Rank (‰∏âÁ≠âÁî∑ SƒÅn dƒõng n√°n) *Feng Yuxiang Modern Chinese styles for foreign monarchs Traditional Chinese political theory held that \\"All lands under Heaven belong to the emperor, all people under Heaven belong, are subjects of the emperor.\\" (ÊôÆÂ§©‰πã‰∏ãÔºåËé´ÈùûÁéãÂúü;ÁéáÂúü‰πãÊø±,Ëé´ÈùûÁéãËá£). Thus, a foreign monarch would also be referred to as Wang, implying that one was inferior in rank and thus subject to the Chinese Emperor. In modern Chinese, a king is referred to as a Wang, while an emperor would be referred to as Huangdi. The king in those times were referred to as the mandate of heaven. Therefore, Victoria of the United Kingdom was styled N√º-Wang (Queen) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and N√º- Huang (Empress) of India. Other historical Chinese titles Other titles might be tailored down to a single individual being officially honored for a particular achievement, with or without executive portfolio following the granting of the title, and might truly be titles outside the executive government structure, even when words used in their phrasing would otherwise imply executive office, e.g., Protector General (ÈÉΩË≠∑; Duhu) ‚Äì for example, Ban Chao. On the other hand, victorious generals were often granted official praise-names or names implying particular old and new duties or some combination of these, which would be quasi-executive or fully executive titles honored as much like peerage as like actual military rank, as in the case of Liu Bei promoting Guan Yu to a rank phrased as General Who Exterminates Bandits (Ëï©ÂØáÂ∞áËªç) during the active course of Guan Yu's military career. In Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), the Dutch authorities appointed Chinese officers to the colonial administration to oversee the governance of the colony's Chinese subjects. These officials bore the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein or Luitenant der Chinezen, and had extensive political and legal jurisdiction over the local Chinese community. Their descendants bore the hereditary title of Sia, and constituted the Cabang Atas or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia.

According to the U.S. Constitution, only states may be represented in the Congress of the United States. The District of Columbia is not a U.S. state and therefore has no voting representation. Instead, constituents in the district elect a non- voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. Despite lacking full voting privileges on the floor of the House of Representatives, delegates are voting members in U.S. Congressional committees and they lobby their congressional colleagues regarding the District's interests. While the office was initially created during the Reconstruction Era by the Radical Republicans, Norton P. Chipman (R) briefly held the seat for less than two terms before the office was eliminated completely. The District of Columbia Delegate Act , of 1970 authorized voters in the District of Columbia to elect one non-voting delegate to represent them in the United States House of Representatives.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/STATUTE-84/STATUTE-84-Pg845-2/content- detail.html The act was approved by Congress on September 22, 1970 and subsequently signed into law by President Richard Nixon. Democrat Walter E. Fauntroy was elected as the district's delegate to Congress in a special election on March 23, 1971, receiving 58 percent of the 116,635 votes cast. Since 1993, when the House of Representatives has been under Democratic control, delegates, including the District of Columbia's delegate, have been allowed to cast non-binding floor votes when the House of Representatives was operating in the Committee of the Whole.The practice began with the 103rd Congress, but was revoked when the Republicans retook the House for the 104th Congress. Democrats reinstated the practice in the 110th Congress, but Republicans again revoked it in the 112th Congress. The district is currently represented by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton.

A standard example is the market for used cars with hidden flaws (\\"lemons\\"). The party without the information is worried about an unfair (\\"rigged\\") trade, which occurs when the party who has all the information uses it to their advantage. The fear of rigged trade can prompt the worried party to withdraw from the interaction, diminishing the volume of trade in the market. This can cause a knock-on effect and the unraveling of the market. An additional implication of this potential for market collapse is that it can work as an entry deterrence that leads to high margins without additional entry. Sometimes buyers know the value of a service better than sellers. For example, a restaurant offering \\"all you can eat\\" at a fixed price risks being preferred by those who know that they will eat a lot, so the seller may try to screen customers using plausible signals of appetite. These phenomena are signaling games and screening games.  Moral hazard  Adverse selection is related to moral hazard. Whereas in adverse selection, the attributes of the product are hidden from one party, in moral hazard, one party may take an action that results from the transaction. For example, moral hazard suggests that customers who have insurance may be more likely to behave recklessly than those who do not. Insurance The term \\"adverse selection\\" was originally used in insurance. It describes a situation where an individual's demand for insurance is positively correlated with the individual's risk of loss. This can be illustrated by the link between smoking status and mortality. Non-smokers typically live longer than smokers. If a life insurance company does not vary prices according to smoking status, its life insurance will be more valuable for smokers than for non-smokers. Smokers will have greater incentives to buy insurance from that company and will purchase insurance in larger amounts than non-smokers. As smokers are at higher risk of early death due to their smoking status, and more smokers than non smokers will purchase life insurance, the average mortality rate increases. This increase means the insurer will spend more on policy payments, leading to losses. In response, the company may increase premiums. However, higher prices cause rational non-smoking customers to cancel their insurance. The higher prices combined with their lower risk of mortality make life insurance uneconomic for non-smokers. This can exacerbate the adverse selection problem. As more smokers take out life insurance policies and increase the insurer's mortality rate, its prices will continue to rise, which in turn will mean fewer non-smokers will purchase insurance. Eventually, the higher prices will push out all non-smokers and the insurer will also be unwilling to sell to smokers. No more interactions will take place, and the life insurance market will collapse. To counter the effects of adverse selection, insurers may offer premiums that are proportional to a customer's risk. The insurer screens customers to distinguish high-risk individuals from low-risk individuals. For instance, medical insurance companies ask a range of questions and may request medical or other reports on individuals who apply to buy insurance. The premium can be varied accordingly and any unreasonably high-risk individuals are rejected. This risk selection process is one part of underwriting. In many countries, insurance law incorporates an \\"utmost good faith\\" or uberrima fides doctrine, which requires potential customers to answer any questions asked by the insurer fully and honestly. Dishonesty may be met with refusals to pay claims.  Evidence of adverse selection in insurance markets  Empirical evidence of adverse selection is mixed. Several studies investigating correlations between risk and insurance purchase have failed to show the predicted positive correlation for life insurance, auto insurance, and health insurance. On the other hand, \\"positive\\" test results for adverse selection have been reported in health insurance, long- term care insurance, and annuity markets. Weak evidence of adverse selection in certain markets suggests that the underwriting process is effective at screening high-risk individuals. Another possible reason is the negative correlation between risk aversion (such as the willingness to purchase insurance) and risk level (estimated beforehand based on hindsight observation of the occurrence rate for other observed claims) in the population. If risk aversion is higher among lower-risk customers, adverse selection can be reduced or even reversed, leading to \\"advantageous\\" selection. This occurs when a person is both less likely to engage in risk-increasing behavior are more likely to engage in risk-decreasing behavior, such as taking affirmative steps to reduce risk. For example, there is evidence that smokers are more willing to do risky jobs than non-smokers. This greater willingness to accept risk may reduce insurance policy purchases by smokers. From a public policy viewpoint, some adverse selection can also be advantageous. Adverse selection may lead to a higher fraction of total losses for the whole population being covered by insurance than if there were no adverse selection.  In capital markets  When raising capital, some types of securities are more prone to adverse selection than others. An equity offering for a company that reliably generates earnings at a good price will be bought up before an unknown company's offering, leaving the market filled with less desirable offerings that were unwanted by other investors. Assuming that managers have inside information about the firm, outsiders are most prone to adverse selection in equity offers. This is because managers may offer stock when they know the offer price exceeds their private assessments of the company's value. Outside investors therefore require a high rate of return on equity to compensate them for the risk of buying a \\"lemon\\". Adverse selection costs are lower for debt offerings. When debt is offered, outside investors infer that managers believe the current stock price is undervalued. Managers would otherwise be keen on offering equity. Thus the required returns on debt and equity are related to perceived adverse selection costs, implying that debt should be cheaper than equity as a source of external capital, forming a \\"pecking order\\" . This example assumes that the market does not know managers are selling stock. The market could possess this information, perhaps finding it in company reports. In this case, the market will capitalize on the information found in company reports. If the market has access to the company's information, there is no longer a state of adverse selection.  In contract theory  In modern contract theory, \\"adverse selection\\" characterizes principal-agent models in which an agent has private information before a contract is written. For example, a worker may know his effort costs (or a buyer may know his willingness-to-pay) before an employer (or a seller) makes a contract offer. In contrast, \\"moral hazard\\" characterizes principal-agent models where there is symmetric information at the time of contracting. The agent may become privately informed after the contract is written. According to Hart and Holmstr√∂m (1987), moral hazard models are further subdivided into hidden action and hidden information models, depending on whether the agent becomes privately informed due to an unobservable action that he himself chooses or due to a random move by nature. Hence, the difference between an adverse selection model and a hidden information (sometimes called hidden knowledge) model is simply the timing. In the former case, the agent is informed at the outset. In the latter case, he becomes privately informed after the contract has been signed. Adverse selection models can be further categorized in models with private values and models with interdependent or common values. In models with private values, the agent's type has a direct influence on his own preferences. For example, he has knowledge over his effort costs or his willingness-to-pay. Alternatively, models with interdependent or common values occur when the agent's type has a direct influence on the principal's preferences. For instance, the agent may be a seller who privately knows the quality of a car. Seminal contributions to private value models have been made by Roger Myerson and Eric Maskin, while interdependent or common value models have first been studied by George Akerlof. Adverse selection models with private values can also be further categorized by distinguishing between models with one-sided private information and two-sided private information. The most prominent result in the latter case is the Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem. More recently, contract-theoretic adverse selection models have been tested both in laboratory experiments and in the field.

Like a flatbed scanner, it consists of a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating for optical impulses into electrical signals. Additionally, nearly all barcode readers contain decoder circuitry that can analyze the barcode's image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode's content to the scanner's output port.  Types of barcode scanners   Technology  A handheld barcode scanner Barcode readers can be differentiated by technologies as follows:  Pen-type readers  Pen-type readers consist of a light source and photodiode that are placed next to each other in the tip of a pen. To read a barcode, the person holding the pen must move the tip of it across the bars at a relatively uniform speed. The photodiode measures the intensity of the light reflected back from the light source as the tip crosses each bar and space in the printed code. The photodiode generates a waveform that is used to measure the widths of the bars and spaces in the barcode. Dark bars in the barcode absorb light and white spaces reflect light so that the voltage waveform generated by the photodiode is a representation of the bar and space pattern in the barcode. This waveform is decoded by the scanner in a manner similar to the way Morse code dots and dashes are decoded.  Laser scanners  Laser scanners work the same way as pen-type readers except that they use a laser beam as the light source and typically employ either a reciprocating mirror or a rotating prism to scan the laser beam back and forth across the barcode. As with the pen-type reader, a photo-diode is used to measure the intensity of the light reflected back from the barcode. In both pen readers and laser scanners, the light emitted by the reader is rapidly varied in brightness with a data pattern and the photo-diode receive circuitry is designed to detect only signals with the same modulated pattern.  CCD readers (also known as LED scanners)  CCD readers use an array of hundreds of tiny light sensors lined up in a row in the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of sensors lined up in a row, a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a barcode is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the barcode whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself. LED scanners can also be made using CMOS sensors, and are replacing earlier Laser-based readers.  Camera-based readers  Two-dimensional imaging scanners are a newer type of barcode reader. They use a camera and image processing techniques to decode the barcode. Video camera readers use small video cameras with the same CCD technology as in a CCD barcode reader except that instead of having a single row of sensors, a video camera has hundreds of rows of sensors arranged in a two dimensional array so that they can generate an image. Large field-of-view readers use high resolution industrial cameras to capture multiple bar codes simultaneously. All the bar codes appearing in the photo are decoded instantly (ImageID patents and code creation tools) or by use of plugins (e.g. the Barcodepedia used a flash application and some web cam for querying a database), have been realized options for resolving the given tasks.  Omnidirectional barcode scanners  Omnidirectional scanning uses \\"series of straight or curved scanning lines of varying directions in the form of a starburst, a Lissajous curve, or other multiangle arrangement are projected at the symbol and one or more of them will be able to cross all of the symbol's bars and spaces, no matter what the orientation. Almost all of them use a laser. Unlike the simpler single-line laser scanners, they produce a pattern of beams in varying orientations allowing them to read barcodes presented to it at different angles. Most of them use a single rotating polygonal mirror and an arrangement of several fixed mirrors to generate their complex scan patterns. Omnidirectional scanners are most familiar through the horizontal scanners in supermarkets, where packages are slid over a glass or sapphire window. There are a range of different omnidirectional units available which can be used for differing scanning applications, ranging from retail type applications with the barcodes read only a few centimetres away from the scanner to industrial conveyor scanning where the unit can be a couple of metres away or more from the code. Omnidirectional scanners are also better at reading poorly printed,wrinkled,or even torn barcodes.  Cell phone cameras  While cell phone cameras without auto-focus are not ideal for reading some common barcode formats, there are 2D barcodes which are optimized for cell phones, as well as QR Codes (Quick Response) codes and Data Matrix codes which can be read quickly and accurately with or without auto-focus. Cell phone cameras open up a number of applications for consumers. For example: * Movies: DVD/VHS movie catalogs. * Music: CD catalogs ‚Äì playing an MP3 when scanned. * Book catalogs and device. * Groceries, nutrition information, making shopping lists when the last of an item is used, etc. * Personal Property inventory (for insurance and other purposes) code scanned into personal finance software when entering. Later, scanned receipt images can then be automatically associated with the appropriate entries. Later, the barcodes can be used to rapidly weed out paper copies not required to be retained for tax or asset inventory purposes. * If retailers put barcodes on receipts that allowed downloading an electronic copy or encoded the entire receipt in a 2D barcode, consumers could easily import data into personal finance, property inventory, and grocery management software. Receipts scanned on a scanner could be automatically identified and associated with the appropriate entries in finance and property inventory software. *Consumer tracking from the retailer perspective (for example, loyalty card programs that track consumers purchases at the point of sale by having them scan a QR code). A number of enterprise applications using cell phones are appearing: *Access control (for example, ticket validation at venues), inventory reporting (for example, tracking deliveries), asset tracking (for example, anti-counterfeiting).Barcode reading apps for enterprise, codeREADr.com, 2010.  Smartphones  * Smartphones can be used in Google's mobile Android operating system via both their own Google Goggles application. Nokia's Symbian operating system features a barcode scanner which can scan barcodes, while mbarcode is a barcode reader for the Maemo operating system. In the Apple iOS, a barcode reader is natively supported within the camera app. With BlackBerry devices, the App World application can natively scan barcodes. Windows Phone 8 is able to scan barcodes through the Bing search app.  Housing  A large multifunction barcode scanner being used to monitor the transportation of packages of radioactive pharmaceuticals Barcode readers can be distinguished based on housing design as follows: ;Handheld scanner: with a handle and typically a trigger button for switching on the light like this are used in factory and farm automation for quality management and shipping. ;PDA scanner (or Auto-ID PDA): a PDA with a built-in barcode reader or attached barcode scanner. ;Automatic reader: a back office equipment to read barcoded documents at high speed (50,000/hour). ;Cordless scanner (or Wireless scanner): a cordless barcode scanner is operated by a battery fit inside it and is not connected to the electricity mains and transfer data to the connected device like PC.  Methods of connection   Early serial interfaces  Early barcode scanners, of all formats, almost universally used the then-common RS-232 serial interface. This was an electrically simple means of connection and the software to access it is also relatively simple, although needing to be written for specific computers and their serial ports.  Proprietary interfaces  There are a few other less common interfaces. These were used in large EPOS systems with dedicated hardware, rather than attaching to existing commodity computers. In some of these interfaces, the scanning device returned a \\"raw\\" signal proportional to the intensities seen while scanning the barcode. This was then decoded by the host device. In some cases the scanning device would convert the symbology of the barcode to one that could be recognized by the host device, such as Code 39.  Keyboard wedge (USB, PS/2, etc)  PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports As the PC with its various standard interfaces evolved, it became ever easier to connect physical hardware to it. Also, there were commercial incentives to reduce the complexity of the associated software. The early \\"Keyboard wedge\\" hardware plugged in between the PS/2 port and the keyboard, with characters from the barcode scanner appearing exactly as if they had been typed at the keyboard. Today the term is used more broadly for any device which can be plugged in and contribute to the stream of data coming \\"from the keyboard\\". Keyboard wedges plugging in via the USB interface are readily available. The \\"keyboard wedge\\" approach makes adding things such as barcode readers to systems simple. The software may well need no changes. The concurrent presence of two \\"keyboards\\" does require some care on the part of the user. Also, barcodes often offer only a subset of the characters offered by a normal keyboard.  USB  Subsequent to the PS/2 era, barcode readers began to use USB ports rather than the keyboard port, this being more convenient. To retain the easy integration with existing programs, it was sometimes necessary to load a device driver called a \\"software wedge\\", which facilitated the keyboard-impersonating behavior of the old \\"keyboard wedge\\" hardware. Today, USB barcode readers are \\"plug and play\\", at least in Windows systems. Any necessary drivers are loaded when the device is plugged in. In many cases, a choice of USB interface types (HID, CDC) are provided. Some have PoweredUSB.  Wireless networking  Some modern handheld barcode readers can be operated in wireless networks according to IEEE 802.11g (WLAN) or IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth). Some barcode readers also support radio frequencies viz. 433 MHz or 910 MHz. Readers without external power sources require their batteries be recharged occasionally, which may make them unsuitable for some uses.  Resolution  The scanner resolution is measured by the size of the dot of light emitted by the reader. If this dot of light is wider than any bar or space in the bar code, then it will overlap two elements (two spaces or two bars) and it may produce wrong output. On the other hand, if a too small dot of light is used, then it can misinterpret any spot on the bar code making the final output wrong. The most commonly used dimension is 13 mil (0.013 in or 0.33 mm), although some scanners can read codes with dimensions as small as 3 mil (0.003 in or 0.075 mm). Smaller bar codes must be printed at high resolution to be read accurately.  See also  * Barcode for more details about barcode technology.

Kervran was born in Quimper, Finist√®re (Brittany), and received a degree as an engineer in 1925. In World War II he was part of the French Resistance.http://www.pansernature.org/Transmutations.htm Kervran proposed that nuclear transmutation occurs in living organisms, which he called \\"biological transmutation\\". He made this claim after doing an experiment with chickens where they were generating calcium in their egg shells while there was no calcium in their food or soil. He had no known scientific explanation for it. Such transmutations are not possible according to mainstream physics, chemistry and biology. Proponents of biological transmutations fall outside mainstream physics and are not part of the scientific discourse. Biological transmutation In the 1960s, Louis Kervran claimed to have conducted experiments and studies demonstrating violations of the law of conservation of mass by biological systems, according to which the amount of each chemical element is preserved in all chemical reactions. Specifically he claimed that organisms can transmute potassium into calcium by nuclear fusion in the course of making an egg shell: \\\\+ ‚Üí Since biological systems do not contain mechanisms to produce the speed, temperature and pressure necessary for such reactions, even for extremely short periods of time, this contradicts basic physical laws. Kervran said that his work was supported by prior studies and by reports of industrial accidents involving carbon monoxide.Louis C. Kervran Preuves en Biologie de Transmutations √† Faible √ânergie, Paris 1975, Maloine, .

The alleged transmutations resemble cold fusion. There is currently no accepted theoretical model which would predict cold fusion to occur. In 1993, Kervran was awarded a parodic Ig Nobel prize due to his \\"improbable research\\" in biological transmutation.

First serialized in Manga Erotopia from 1986 to 1989, Urotsukid≈çji marked a departure from Maeda's earlier works, with its focus on erotica, dark humor, and the supernatural. Starting in 1987, the manga was adapted into a series of original video animation (OVA) anime releases by director Hideki Takayama. The adaptations deviate significantly from the manga, adding elements of violence, sadomasochism, and rape not present in the source material. Urotsukid≈çji has been credited with popularizing the trope of tentacle rape, and The Erotic Anime Movie Guide calls it a formative work in the hentai genre.Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements, The Erotic Anime Movie Guide. Overlook Books, 1999. In 2005, it was voted as one of the 100 greatest cartoons in a poll by Channel 4.  Synopsis   Manga  Amano Jyaku, a mischievous, sociopathic demon/human hybrid, is banished to Earth and ordered by The Great Elder to find the Ch≈çjin: the unbeatable god of the demon world who is hiding within the body of a man. A group of reptilian/amphibian demons want to find the Ch≈çjin and use his power on behalf of the Queen of Demons. Under the leadership of Suikakuju, the Elder's rival and lover of his estranged wife, the Queen of Demons, they hatch a series of plots to try to capture the Ch≈çjin, most of which go horribly wrong. Amano is sent to protect the Ch≈çjin, but after his lecherous friend Koroko and then later his nymphomaniac sister Megumi come to find him, this proves to be more difficult.  Anime  Every 3,000 years the is united with the and the by the revival of the , known as the Overfiend in the English version. The saga follows Jyaku Amano‚Äîa man-beast‚Äîand his quest to find the Ch≈çjin and to ensure the safe future of all three worlds. However, he finds his beliefs put to the test when he encounters numerous demons, who plan to destroy the Ch≈çjin and prevent the three worlds from joining.  Characters  As the Urotsukid≈çji saga spans over a number of years it incorporates a wide variety of characters. Below is a list of the main characters, which are split into their races:  Ningen (\\"Humans\\")  ; : The human through which the Ch≈çjin would be reborn. He is shy and lecherous. Fated to mutate into the Demon of Destruction who decimates the world to pave the way for the birth of his \\"messianic\\" offspring. ; :In the anime, she is presented as a young, innocent, naive girl, and the idol at My≈çjin University. In the manga, she is sometimes shown as more sexually adventurous. She becomes Nagumo's girlfriend, and the mother of the Ch≈çjin. ; : An anime-only character; Nagumo's cousin, whom M√ºnchhausen II uses to resurrect the Ky≈ç-≈å. He commits a series of rapes and murders under the control of the German diabolist, who contorts his mind against those he loves. He falls for Megumi Amano, only to be killed by her in the battle against M√ºnchhausen II atop the Shinjuku skyscrapers. ; : A school nerd who loves Akemi and jealously hates Nagumo. He is later used by Suikakuj≈´ as a vessel to destroy the Ch≈çjin, with the aid of a demonic phallus which he promptly substitutes for his own. He meets his end at the hands of Nagumo, who tears out his organs. ; :The jock all the girls fall for in My≈çjin University. He is a major character in the manga, though is only seen in the first volume of the OVA series. Jyaku mistakes him for the Ch≈çjin, which ultimately leads to his demise. ; : A character who only appears in the manga, he is Niki's bodyguard and childhood friend. Although he appears to be morbidly obese, he is very strong and attacks anyone who bullies Niki. He later befriends Nagumo and Akemi after Niki ditches him.  J≈´jin (\\"Beast-men\\")  ; :The male protagonist of the saga, he has been searching for the Ch≈çjin for three hundred years. He holds to his belief in the Ch≈çjin and his Land of Eternity, until events play out in a way totally contrary to what he hoped for. ; : Jyaku's nymphomaniac sister, she believes Tatsuo to be the Ch≈çjin from the start. In the manga, she becomes Akemi's rival. She also falls in love with Takeaki in the anime. ; : One of the wisest elders in the Man-Beast realm. In the manga, he banishes Jyaku from the realm of demons for constantly fooling around with his daughter Mimi. In the anime, he helps Jyaku discover the truth behind the legend of the Ch≈çjin. According to his own words in the second episode of the first OVA, The Great Elder has lived in the Man-Beast world for 993 years. ; : The Elder's granddaughter and lover of Jyaku Amano. Her orgasm has the power to project visions of the future.  Majin (\\"Demons\\")  ; : Jyaku Amano's rival, and the Demon Queen's champion. His quest is to destroy the Ch≈çjin in order to keep Makai (the \\"Demon World\\") intact. ; : A demon who was banished to Hell for having an affair with Megumi, he later becomes M√ºnchhausen II's lackey. He is mortally wounded in battle with Amano and dies after rescuing Megumi. He is not featured in the manga. ; : In the manga, Ms. Togami is a nymphomaniac teacher who gets possessed by an iguanalike demon. The demon then tries to seduce Akemi, until Jyaku manages to drive the iguanalike demon out. He later tricks her into having sex, so that his magical sperm can protect her from the lizardlike demons. In the anime it is not explained whether or not she is possessed or a demon in disguise; a demon sent to Earth to hunt (and presumably destroy) the Ch≈çjin. Despite her mission, she still finds time to rape Akemi, but Amano Jyaku intervenes and destroys her. ; Yoenki: An anime-only character. She is Suikakuj≈´'s sister, who attacks Jyaku in Osaka. In the anime, she is manipulated into attacking Jyaku via M√ºnchhausen II's mind control powers. ; Goki, Yoki, and Sekki: Three demons searching for the Ch≈çjin, who are later killed by Tatsuo. They appear only in the manga.  Makemono (\\"Demon-Beasts\\") (anime only)  ; Buju: A key character in the post-apocalyptic chapters of the saga. Starts off as a raping, pillaging marauder, only to find some semblance of purpose and redemption in becoming the Ky≈ç-≈å's guardian on his long journey toward Osaka to confront the Ch≈çjin. ; Gashim: A kindhearted, elderly makemono who accompanies Buju, Himi, Jyaku et al. to Osaka, following his release from Caesar's captivity. ; Ruddle: Another makemono spared from the devastating effects of Ky≈ç-≈å's Light of Judgment at Caesar's palace. Joins Jyaku and the other makemono in their journey toward Osaka. ; Idaten: A pure-hearted makemono youth who takes the high road to Osaka with his fellows. He develops an unrequieted crush on Himi.  Other characters  ; : One of the Kuroko tribe. Holds deep respect for his boss, Amano Jyaku. ; : An anime-only character. A sorcerer following the footsteps of his father who died in the service of Adolf Hitler, he is the son of a mad Nazi German scientist, hell- bent on resurrecting the Ky≈ç-≈å and dominating the world. Having survived most of the saga, M√ºnchhausen II is finally killed by Himi when she unleashes her power. ; : An anime-only character. A supernatural being created by the Ch≈çjin as part of a new race to both replace and exterminate the humans, Man-Beasts and demons. It has the ability to change its own gender whenever it wants, and it can also create other living beings and control the minds of other living beings into doing what it pleases. It appears in Urotsukid≈çji: The Final Chapter. ; : The Super God. His legend reveals that every three thousand years he will be reborn into the human realm. In the anime it is to unite the different worlds into a world of peace. ; : The nemesis of the Ch≈çjin, in the anime he is born from the congealed blood of Takeaki at the Gokumon shrine. M√ºnchhausen II desperately wants to resurrect him to take over Earth. ; : The demon that Suikakuj≈´ summons from the sea to kill the Ch≈çjin. In the anime, Suikakuj≈´s summoning of the Sea Demon King in 1923 results in the Great Kant≈ç earthquake.  Anime cast  {  - ! Character Role !! Original Japanese version !!

The first three-volume series within the larger Penthouse series was named . These three episodes were adapted from the original manga but skip over much of the comedic sub-stories and subplots and instead shift the focus to the apocalypse and the battle between Suikakuju and Jyaku. The three OVAs were later edited into a theatrical film known as . The removal of certain explicit material resulted in the film being given a rating from Japan's Film Classification and Rating Organization. Shochiku-Fuji distributed the film to theaters while Shochiku Home Video distributed the film to VHS with the tagline . The theatrical film was released in North America on VHS on August 11, 1993 by Central Park Media under the \\"Anime 18\\" label - it was their first title to be released with the label. The film was also released in the UK and Australia, with additional cuts being made by the BBFC and OFLC. ; Plot Planet Earth is not all it seems. It is revealed that humans are not alone and that there are unseen realms running parallel to our own: the realms of the Demons (Makai) and the Man-Beasts (Jyujinkai). To further that, there is a 3000-year- old legend that foretells the coming of the Overfiend (Ch≈çjin)‚Äîa being of unimaginable power that will unite all three realms into a land of eternity. The story follows the exploits of the protagonists‚Äîman-beast Jyaku Amano, his nymphomaniac sister Megumi and their companion Kuroko‚Äîas their 300-year search for the Overfiend takes them to a high school in Osaka, Japan. Their discoveries led them to two students: shy, lecherous Tatsuo Nagumo and school idol Akemi Ito. But as the film plunges deeper into the dark and gruesome, Jyaku discovers that the Legend of the Overfiend is not what it seems and that the future of the three realms may be strikingly different from what he is led to believe.  DVD releases  # Perfect Collection (Anime 18)‚Äî2:26:06 # Special DVD Edition (Manga Entertainment)‚Äî1:42:55 # Movie Edition (Kitty Media)‚Äî1:45:20 The Perfect Collection from Anime 18 is the only English- friendly uncut version of the first OVA available outside Japan. Other versions such as the one on the \\"Hell on Earth\\" boxed set and the Australian Madman release with both Legend of the Overfiend and Legend of the Demon Womb have been cut for 45 minutes in total, which included a total of 24 minutes of sexually-oriented scenes. The U.S. DVD releases are now out-of-print. The Movie Edition, licensed by Kitty Media in 2010 and released in 2011, is the first time any of the anime has been released on Blu-ray, though it is reformatted for widescreen (the DVD version released alongside it retains the original aspect ratio).  Legend of the Demon Womb (1990‚Äì1991)  # \\"A Prayer for the Resurrection of the Lord of Chaos\\" (December 1, 1990) # \\"Battle at Shinjuku Skyscrapers\\" (April 10, 1991) The second OVA series was named . This series was not based on the manga, but elements from it were used, with Negumo's cousin Takeaki taking on a character similar to the character of Niki in the manga and M√ºnchhausen II taking after the character of Suikakuju. The second part of the saga created an ongoing controversy among Urotsukid≈çji fans as to where it fits into the saga as a whole. One main theory is that the two chapters happen between \\"Birth of the Overfiend\\" and \\"Curse of the Overfiend\\" of the first OVA. Another main theory is that since the characters and tone are fairly unfaithful to the first three OVAs, it ought not to be considered part of the canon in the first place. The two OVAs were again later recut into a theatrical version, known as Urotsukid≈çji: Legend of the Demon Womb; however, whereas the original two OVA episodes in this case censored sexual acts with blurring throughout, the movie edit was fully uncensored and even featured additional scenes with new animation and effects added to improve existing scenes. No material was taken out in the process‚Äîthe time difference arising due to redundant credits and recaps‚Äîso the movie is to be considered the most complete version. Unbeknownst to Jyaku and Megumi, in 1944, the Nazis attempted to summon the Overfiend's nemesis: the Lord of Chaos (Ky≈ç-≈å). Top scientist Dr. M√ºnchhausen and his son invented a perverse death-rape machine to summon the Lord of Chaos‚Äîbut the machine overloaded; and helped to destroy half of Berlin‚Äîleaving M√ºnchhausen II alive, but psychologically scarred. During his adolescence, M√ºnchhausen II discovers his father's journal and tries to uncover the secrets of the Jyujinkai and the Makai. He finally succeeds and reawakens Kohoki‚Äîa demon banished to hell for eternity‚Äîinto the human realm and the two form an infamous partnership. Cut to the present day and M√ºnchhausen II is trying to fulfill his father's work‚Äîto summon the Lord of Chaos‚Äîbut to make sure it will work this time, he needs a human sacrifice. And it just so happens Tatsuo's cousin Takeaki Kiryu is on the next plane to Osaka...

As mentioned above, this was rectified for the movie version which is uncensored and contains more original material than the OVAs. Anime 18's DVD release is uncut though others (such as Manga UK's) have again been censored with cuts made. Both Japanese and English-language tracks are included on Anime 18's DVD of the movie, but there are no subtitles. Like the Perfect Collection, it is not region-coded. Other versions such as the one on the \\"Hell on Earth\\" boxed set and the Australian Madman release with both Legend of the Overfiend and Legend of the Demon Womb have been cut for 14 minutes in total, which included a total of 7 minutes of sexually-oriented scenes. The U.S. releases are also now out-of-print.  Return of the Overfiend (1992‚Äì1993)  # \\"Birth of the True Overfiend\\" (October 1, 1992) # \\"The Mystery of Caesar's Palace\\" (January 21, 1993) # \\"The Collapse of Caesar's Palace\\" (May 21, 1993) # \\"Journey to an Unknown World\\" (August 21, 1993) The third OVA series was named . This is where the saga begins to focus less on the remaining central characters and introduces other secondary characters, none of whom are present in the manga. The four parts were edited for western audiences as Urotsukid≈çji: Return of the Overfiend, in some cases cut into a pair of films. At the end of \\"Final Inferno\\", it is discovered that the Ch≈çjin is the offspring of Tatsuo and Akemi and of Tatsuo's horrific metamorphosis into the Demon of Destruction‚Äîwho needs to \\"destroy the old to make way for the new\\". Twenty years have passed and the Chojin has been prematurely born. He summons Jyaku Amano to protect him and to help to discover what has happened, sending Jyaku forth to search for the evil born in the east. Unfortunately a new race called the Makemono (Demon-Beasts) have arisen following the apocalypse, ruled over by the fanatical cyborg Caesar and his mysterious comrade \\"Faust\\". It is apparent they are the cause behind these events and intend to resurrect the Ky≈ç-≈å. Jyaku, along with the Makemono Buju and Caesar's traitorous daughter Alector, need to stop the two dictators from ruling the land of eternity. The question is, who will succeed?  Inferno Road (1993‚Äì1995)  # \\"The Secret Garden\\" (December 21, 1993) # \\"The Long Road to God\\" (March 21, 1994) # \\"The End of the Journey\\" (May 20, 1995) The fourth OVA series was named . It was banned outright in many countries (including Britain), but was edited again for the west under the title Urotsukid≈çji: Inferno Road. Continuing straight after the climax of Return of the Overfiend, Jyaku and the survivors head for Osaka to help the Overfiend after his climatic battle. On the way they find a kingdom where children rule over adults (OVAs 1 and 2). Jyaku's problems are furthered when an old nemesis shows up at the wrong time (OVA 3). The third OVA in this series, \\"The End of the Journey\\", stands alone plot-wise (wrapping up the story arc from Urotsukidoji: Return of the Overfiend, on which the first two OVA have no bearing), and was originally intended to be a theatrical release. It is based on the final chapters of Maeda's New Urotsukidoji. NOTE: Inferno Road was originally intended to have another ending, which was fully completed but ultimately discarded. This ending was to have revealed that the apparent Ch≈çjin as seen at the start of Urotsukidoji: Return of the Overfiend was not in fact the real Ch≈çjin, but yet another Makai. This alternate ending was to have set up the abandoned The Final Chapter.  The Final Chapter (1996)  # \\"The Final\\" (December 28, 1996) The fifth OVA series was named , also known as Urotsukid≈çji: The Final Chapter in the west. Only one episode of this was partially completed, the released version containing numerous examples of animation that is missing in-between frames. The story, as such, concerned the arrival of the real Ch≈çjin who creates a new hermaphroditic race to wipe out all remaining life on Earth. After giving birth to the Ch≈çjin, Akemi reawakens in a hospital, along with Jyaku, who had barely survived a recent confrontation with the Ch≈çjin (whose form constantly mutates between male and female). Destroyer God Tatsuo also reappears (after supposedly being killed by Ky≈ç-≈å in Urotsukidoji: Return of the Overfiend) and continues his ravaging of Earth. Still in love with Tatsuo, Akemi runs out to find him. Meanwhile, Jyaku is confronted by some of the Ch≈çjin's new 'children', and engages them in battle. However, his efforts prove almost futile, as they are constantly regenerated by the Chojin. Akemi eventually finds Tatsuo, still in his God form, and pleads with him. He clutches her in his hand (similarly to the end of the first episode) and prepares to kill her. However, she is rescued at the last minute by Jyaku, although she condemns him for doing so.  New Urotsukid≈çji: New Saga (2002)  # \\"The Urotsuki: Part I\\" (May 3, 2002) # \\"The Urotsuki: Part II\\" (August 9, 2002) # \\"The Urotsuki: Part III\\" (November 19, 2002) This series was named , also known as New Urotsukid≈çji: New Saga in the west, and was released in North America on March 9, 2004. This three-disc collection is a retelling of the first episode in The Legend of the Overfiend. It has the same basic plot as Birth of the Overfiend.  New Urotsukidoji manga  After the popularity of the anime version of his work, Maeda sought to redo the Urotsukidoji series. Inspired by the post-apocalyptic story in the anime version, Maeda fleshed out the story and also took it into the realm of the post-apocalyptic. The Urotsuki video series and the Urotsukidoji horror film are the only anime works which have borrowed from this series.

He was the first Labour cabinet minister, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934 and, uniquely, served three separate terms as Leader of the Labour Party in three different decades. He was popular among his colleagues, who called him \\"Uncle Arthur\\" in acknowledgement of his integrity, his devotion to the cause and his imperturbability. He was a transitional figure whose policies were, at first, close to those of the Liberal Party. The trades unions rejected his emphasis on arbitration and conciliation, and thwarted his goal of unifying the Labour Party and the trade unions.  Early life  Arthur Henderson was born at 10 Paterson Street, Anderston, Glasgow, Scotland, in 1863, the son of Agnes, a domestic servant, and David Henderson, a textile worker who died when Arthur was ten years old. After his father's death, the Hendersons moved to Newcastle upon Tyne in the North-East of England, where Agnes later married Robert Heath. Henderson worked at Robert Stephenson and Sons' General Foundry Works from the age of twelve. After finishing his apprenticeship there aged seventeen, he moved to Southampton for a year and then returned to work as an iron moulder (a type of foundryman) in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Henderson became a Methodist in 1879 (having previously been a Congregationalist) and became a Local Preacher. After he lost his job in 1884, he concentrated on preaching.  Union leader  In 1892, Henderson entered the complex world of trade union politics when he was elected as a paid organiser for the Friendly Society of Iron Founders. He also became a representative on the North East Conciliation Board. Henderson believed that strikes caused more harm than they were worth and tried to avoid them whenever he could. For this reason, he opposed the formation of the General Federation of Trade Unions, as he was convinced that it would lead to more strikes.  The Labour Party  Henderson (on left) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party In 1900 Henderson was one of the 129 trade union and socialist delegates who passed Keir Hardie's motion to create the Labour Representation Committee (LRC). In 1903, Henderson was elected Treasurer of the LRC and was also elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnard Castle at a by-election. From 1903 to 1904, Henderson also served as mayor of Darlington, County Durham. In 1906, the LRC changed its name to the Labour Party and won 29 seats at the general election. In 1908, when Hardie resigned as Leader of the Labour Party, Henderson was elected to replace him. He remained Leader until his own resignation two years later, in 1910.  Cabinet Minister  In 1914 the First World War broke out and Ramsay MacDonald resigned from the Leadership of the Labour Party in protest. Henderson was elected to replace him. The two became enemies.Christopher Howard, \\"MacDonald, Henderson, and the Outbreak of War, 1914.\\" Historical Journal 20.4 (1977): 871-891. online In 1915, following Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's decision to create a coalition government, Henderson became the first member of the Labour Party to become a member of the Cabinet, as President of the Board of Education. In 1916, David Lloyd George forced Asquith to resign and replaced him as Prime Minister. Henderson became a member of the small War Cabinet with the post of Minister without Portfolio on December 9, 1916. (The other Labour representatives who joined Henderson in Lloyd George's coalition government were John Hodge, who became Minister of Labour, and George Barnes, who became Minister of Pensions.) Henderson resigned on August 11, 1917 after his proposal for an international conference on the war was rejected by the rest of the Cabinet.Eric Hopkins, 'A Social History of the English Working Classes, 1815‚Äì1945 (Hodder & Stoughton, 1979) p. 219. . Henderson turned his attention to building a strong constituency- based support network for the Labour Party. Previously, it had little national organisation, based largely on branches of unions and socialist societies. Working with Ramsay MacDonald and Sidney Webb, Henderson in 1918 established a national network of constituency organisations. They operated separately from trade unions and the National Executive Committee and were open to everyone sympathetic to the party's policies. Secondly, Henderson secured the adoption of a comprehensive statement of party policies, as drafted by Sidney Webb. Entitled \\"Labour and the New Social Order,\\" it remained the basic Labour platform until 1950. It proclaimed a socialist party whose principles included a guaranteed minimum standard of living for everyone, nationalisation of industry, and heavy taxation of large incomes and of wealth.Bentley B. Gilbert, Britain since 1918 (1980) p 49.  The \\"Coupon Election\\" and the 1920s  Henderson lost his seat in the \\"Coupon Election\\" of 14 December 1918, which had been announced within twenty-four hours of the end of hostilities and which resulted in a landslide victory for a coalition formed by Lloyd George.Katz, Liane (4 April 2005) \\"Women and the Welsh Wizard\\". Politics.guardian.co.uk. Retrieved on 12 September 2015. However, Henderson returned to Parliament in 1919 after winning a by-election in Widnes. He then became Labour's Chief Whip, only to lose his seat again, at the general election of 1922. Vladimir Lenin held Henderson in very low regard. In a letter to the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Georgy Chicherin, written on 10 February 1922 and referring to the Genoa Conference, Lenin wrote: \\"Henderson is as stupid as Kerensky, and for this reason he is helping us.\\"Handwritten note at the Russian Center for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, fond 2, opis 2, delo 1,1119, published as Document 88 in The Unknown Lenin, ed. Richard Pipes, Yale University Press, 1996. . Henderson returned to Parliament via another by-election, this time representing Newcastle East, but again, he was unseated at the general election of 1923. He returned to Parliament just two months later after winning another by-election in Burnley. In 1924, Henderson was appointed as Home Secretary in the first-ever Labour government, led by MacDonald. This government was defeated later the same year and lost the general election that followed. Having been re-elected in 1924, Henderson refused to challenge MacDonald for the party leadership. Worried about factionalism in the Labour Party, he published a pamphlet, Labour and the Nation, in which he attempted to clarify the party's goals.  Foreign Secretary  In 1929, Labour formed another minority government and MacDonald appointed Henderson as Foreign Secretary, a position Henderson used to try to reduce the tensions that had been building up in Europe since the end of the First World War. Diplomatic relations were re-established with the USSR and Henderson guaranteed Britain's full support to the League of Nations.  The MacDonald \\"betrayal\\"  The Great Depression plunged the government into a terminal crisis. The Cabinet agreed that it was essential to maintain the Gold Standard and that the Budget needed to be balanced, but were divided over reducing unemployment benefits by 10%. At first, Henderson gave strong support to Prime Minister MacDonald throughout the financial and political crisis of August. The financial crisis across Europe was worsening and Britain's gold reserves were at high risk. New York banks provided an emergency loan; but additional money was needed and to get it, the budget had to be balanced. MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden proposed cuts in unemployment benefits. Henderson rejected that solution and became the leader of nearly half the Cabinet. The Labour Cabinet decided to resign. The King implored MacDonald to remain and form an all-party National government that would make the budget cuts. MacDonald agreed on 24 August 1931 and formed an emergency National Government, with members from all parties. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called \\"National Labour Party\\") who stood with Macdonald, plus four Conservatives and two Liberals. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters from the party. Henderson cast the only vote against the expulsions. Against his inclinations, Henderson accepted the leadership of the main Labour Party and led it into the general election on 27 October against the cross-party National coalition. It was a disastrous result for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52. MacDonald won the largest landslide in British electoral history. Yet again Henderson lost his seat, at Burnley. The following year, he relinquished the party leadership.Andrew Thorpe, \\"Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931.\\" Historical Journal 31#1 (1988): 117-139. in JSTOR  Later career  Henderson returned to Parliament after winning a by-election at Clay Cross, achieving the unique feat of being elected a total of five times at by- elections in constituencies where he had not previously been the MP. He holds the record for the greatest number of comebacks from losing a previous seat. Henderson spent the rest of his life trying to halt the gathering storm of war. He worked with the World League of Peace and chaired the Geneva Disarmament Conference, and in 1934 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. (On 3 April 2013 his Nobel medal was stolen from the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Newcastle.)\\"Nobel Peace Prize Medal Stolen in Newcastle\\". BBC News. 3 April 2013. Henderson died in 1935, aged 72. All three of Henderson's sons saw military service during the Great War, the eldest, David, being killed in action in 1916 whilst serving as a Captain with the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own). His surviving sons also became Labour politicians: second son William was granted the title of Baron Henderson in 1945, while his third son, Arthur, was created Baron Rowley in 1966. The Labour History Archive and Study Centre at the People's History Museum in Manchester holds the papers of Arthur Henderson in their collection, spanning from 1915 to 1935.

Commissioners function in every respect as a member of Congress, including sponsoring legislation and serving on congressional committees, where they can vote on legislation, except that they are denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. They receive a salary of $174,000 per year and are identified as Member of Congress. The current commissioner is Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n of the New Progressive Party (PNP), the first woman to hold the post. She is also affiliated with the Republican Party (R) at the national level. Other U.S. territories have a similar representative position called a delegate.  History  The United States Congress had seated non-voting \\"delegates\\" from various territories since 1794 as the country expanded across North America; these territories were all eventually admitted as states. The position of delegate was a legislative position with a two-year term, just like a member of Congress. The United States acquired several overseas possessions as a result of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. While the House of Representatives voted in 1900 for Puerto Rico to select a delegate, Congress instead devised a new form of territorial representative in the Resident Commissioner. United States Senator John Coit Spooner argued that granting a territory a delegate implied that it was on the path to statehood, which he asserted was not guaranteed for the new possessions acquired in the war, such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines. In fact, more than a century later, neither has become a state. (Puerto Rico remains a U.S. territory, while The Philippines became an independent republic in 1946.) The original Resident Commissioner positions served a two-year term, though it was later extended to four years. The position also had executive responsibility in addition to legislative ones. The term had previously been used in the British Empire (see Resident Commissioner), but in an almost opposite sense; a British Resident Commissioner was sent as the Crown's representative to manage a territory, while an American Resident Commissioner was sent as the representative of a territory to the national government. This representation has evolved over time. At first, the resident commissioner could not even be present on the floor of the House of Representatives; floor privileges were granted in 1902. In 1904, the officeholder gained the right to speak during debate and serve on the Committee on Insular Affairs, which had responsibility for the territories gained in the Spanish-American War. In 1933, Resident Commissioner Santiago Iglesias was appointed to additional committees, and each of his successors has served on other committees also. But only in 1970 did the Resident Commissioner gain the right to vote in committees, gain seniority, or hold leadership positions. The present-day Resident Commissioner, like the delegates from other territories and the District of Columbia, have almost all of the rights of other House members, including being able to sponsor bills and offer amendments and motions. Territorial representatives remain unable to vote on matters before the full House. Summary of commissioners Puerto Rico's at-large congressional district Puerto Rico is represented by a non- voting resident commissioner in the United States House of Representatives.

ECN allows end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets. ECN is an optional feature that may be used between two ECN- enabled endpoints when the underlying network infrastructure also supports it. Conventionally, TCP/IP networks signal congestion by dropping packets. When ECN is successfully negotiated, an ECN-aware router may set a mark in the IP header instead of dropping a packet in order to signal impending congestion. The receiver of the packet echoes the congestion indication to the sender, which reduces its transmission rate as if it detected a dropped packet. Rather than responding properly or ignoring the bits, some outdated or faulty network equipment has historically dropped or mangled packets that have ECN bits set. , measurements suggested that the fraction of web servers on the public Internet for which setting ECN prevents network connections had been reduced to less than 1%. Passive support has existed in Ubuntu Linux since 12.04 and in Windows Server since 2012. Passive support in the most popular websites has increased from 8.5% in 2012 to over 70% in May 2017. Adoption across the Internet now requires clients to actively request ECN. In June 2015, Apple announced that ECN will be enabled by default on its supported and future products, to help drive the adoption of ECN signaling industry-wide. Operation ECN requires specific support at both the Internet layer and the transport layer for the following reasons: * In TCP/IP, routers operate within the Internet layer, while the transmission rate is handled by the endpoints at the transport layer. * Congestion may be handled only by the transmitter, but since it is known to have happened only after a packet was sent, there must be an echo of the congestion indication by the receiver to the transmitter. Without ECN, congestion indication echo is achieved indirectly by the detection of lost packets. With ECN, the congestion is indicated by setting the ECN field within an IP packet to CE and is echoed back by the receiver to the transmitter by setting proper bits in the header of the transport protocol. For example, when using TCP, the congestion indication is echoed back by setting the ECE bit. Operation of ECN with IP ECN uses the two least significant (right-most) bits of the Traffic Class field in the IPv4 or IPv6 header to encode four different code points: * \`00\` - Non ECN-Capable Transport, Non-ECT * \`10\` - ECN Capable Transport, ECT(0) * \`01\` - ECN Capable Transport, ECT(1) * \`11\` - Congestion Encountered, CE. When both endpoints support ECN they mark their packets with ECT(0) or ECT(1). Routers treat the ECT(0) and ECT(1) codepoints as equivalent. If the packet traverses an active queue management (AQM) queue (e.g., a queue that uses random early detection (RED)) that is experiencing congestion and the corresponding router supports ECN, it may change the code point to \`CE\` instead of dropping the packet. This act is referred to as ‚Äúmarking‚Äù and its purpose is to inform the receiving endpoint of impending congestion. At the receiving endpoint, this congestion indication is handled by the upper layer protocol (transport layer protocol) and needs to be echoed back to the transmitting node in order to signal it to reduce its transmission rate. Because the CE indication can only be handled effectively by an upper layer protocol that supports it, ECN is only used in conjunction with upper layer protocols, such as TCP, that support congestion control and have a method for echoing the CE indication to the transmitting endpoint. Operation of ECN with TCP TCP supports ECN using two flags in the TCP header. The first, ECN-Echo (ECE) is used to echo back the congestion indication (i.e. signal the sender to reduce the amount of information it sends). The second, Congestion Window Reduced (CWR), to acknowledge that the congestion-indication echoing was received. Use of ECN on a TCP connection is optional; for ECN to be used, it must be negotiated at connection establishment by including suitable options in the SYN and SYN-ACK segments. When ECN has been negotiated on a TCP connection, the sender indicates that IP packets that carry TCP segments of that connection are carrying traffic from an ECN Capable Transport by marking them with an ECT code point. This allows intermediate routers that support ECN to mark those IP packets with the CE code point instead of dropping them in order to signal impending congestion. Upon receiving an IP packet with the Congestion Experienced code point, the TCP receiver echoes back this congestion indication using the ECE flag in the TCP header. When an endpoint receives a TCP segment with the ECE bit it reduces its congestion window as for a packet drop. It then acknowledges the congestion indication by sending a segment with the CWR bit set. A node keeps transmitting TCP segments with the ECE bit set until it receives a segment with the CWR bit set. To see affected packets with tcpdump, use the filter predicate \`(tcp[13] & 0xc0 != 0)\`. ECN and TCP control packets Since the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) does not perform congestion control on control packets (pure ACKs, SYN, FIN segments), control packets are usually not marked as ECN-capable. A 2009 proposalRFC 5562 - Adding Explicit Congestion Notification Capability to TCP's SYN/ACK Packets. A. Kuzmanovic, A. Mondal, S. Floyd, K. Ramakrishnan suggests marking SYN-ACK packets as ECN- capable. This improvement, known as ECN+, has been shown to provide dramatic improvements to performance of short-lived TCP connections.Aleksandar Kuzmanovic. The power of explicit congestion notification. In Proceedings of the 2005 conference on Applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communications. 2005. Operation of ECN with other transport protocols ECN is also defined for other transport layer protocols that perform congestion control, notably DCCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The general principle is similar to TCP, although the details of the on-the-wire encoding differ. It is possible to use ECN with protocols layered above UDP. However, UDP requires that congestion control be performed by the application, and early UDP based protocols such as DNS did not use ECN. More recent UDP based protocols such as QUIC are using ECN for congestion control. Effects on performance Since ECN is only effective in combination with an Active Queue Management (AQM) policy, the benefits of ECN depend on the precise AQM being used. A few observations, however, appear to hold across different AQMs. As expected, ECN reduces the number of packets dropped by a TCP connection, which, by avoiding a retransmission, reduces latency and especially jitter. This effect is most drastic when the TCP connection has a single outstanding segment,Jamal Hadi Salim and Uvaiz Ahmed. Performance Evaluation of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in IP Networks. RFC 2884. July 2000 when it is able to avoid an RTO timeout; this is often the case for interactive connections, such as remote logins, and transactional protocols, such as HTTP requests, the conversational phase of SMTP, or SQL requests. Effects of ECN on bulk throughput are less clearMarek Malowidzki, Simulation- based Study of ECN Performance in RED Networks, In Proc. SPECTS'03. 2003. because modern TCP implementations are fairly good at resending dropped segments in a timely manner when the sender's window is large. Use of ECN has been found to be detrimental to performance on highly congested networks when using AQM algorithms that never drop packets. Modern AQM implementations avoid this pitfall by dropping rather than marking packets at very high load. Implementations Many modern implementations of the TCP/IP protocol suite have some support for ECN; however, they usually ship with ECN disabled. ECN support in TCP by hosts Microsoft Windows Windows versions since Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista support ECN for TCP. Since Windows Server 2012, it is enabled by default in Windows Server versions, because Data Center Transmission Control Protocol (DCTCP) is used. In previous Windows versions and non-server versions it is disabled by default. ECN support can be enabled using a shell command such as . BSD On FreeBSD, ECN for TCP can be configured using the sysctl. By default, it is enabled only for incoming connections that request it. It can also be enabled for all connections or disabled entirely. NetBSD 4.0 implements ECN support for TCP; it can be activated through the sysctl interface by setting 1 as value for the parameter. Likewise, the sysctl can be used in OpenBSD. Linux Since version 2.4.20 of the Linux kernel, released in November 2002, Linux supports three working modes of the ECN for TCP, as configured through the sysctl interface by setting parameter to one of the following values: * disable ECN and neither initiate nor accept it * enable ECN when requested by incoming connections, and also request ECN on outgoing connection attempts * (default) enable ECN when requested by incoming connections, but do not request ECN on outgoing connections Beginning with version 4.1 of the Linux kernel, released in June 2015, the mechanism, as specified in RFC 3168 section 6.1.1.1, is enabled by default when ECN is enabled (the value of 1). The fallback mechanism attempts ECN connectivity in the initial setup of outgoing connections, with a graceful fallback for transmissions without ECN capability, mitigating issues with ECN-intolerant hosts or firewalls. Mac OS X Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 implement ECN support for TCP. It is controlled using the boolean sysctl variables and . The first variable enables ECN on incoming connections that already have ECN flags set; the second one tries to initiate outgoing connections with ECN enabled. Both variables default to , but can be set to to enable the respective behavior. In June 2015, Apple Inc. announced that OS X 10.11 would have ECN turned on by default. That never happened, in macOS Sierra, ECN is enabled for 50 percent of TCP sessions iOS In June 2015, Apple Inc. announced that iOS 9, its next version of iOS, would support ECN and have it turned on by default. TCP ECN negotiation is enabled on 5% of randomly selected connections over Wi- Fi / Ethernet in iOS 9 and 50% of randomly selected connections over Wi-Fi / Ethernet and a few cellular carriers in iOS 10 and 100% for iOS 11 Solaris The Solaris kernel supports three states of ECN for TCP: * no ECN * use ECN * only advertise ECN support when asked for. The default behavior is . As of Solaris 11, full ECN usage can be activated via . ECN support in IP by routers Since ECN marking in routers is dependent on some form of active queue management, routers must be configured with a suitable queue discipline in order to perform ECN marking. Cisco IOS routers perform ECN marking if configured with the WRED queuing discipline since version 12.2(8)T. Linux routers perform ECN marking if configured with one of the RED or GRED queue disciplines with an explicit ecn parameter, by using the sfb discipline, by using the CoDel Fair Queuing (fq_codel) discipline, or the CAKE queuing discipline. Modern BSD implementations, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, have support for ECN marking in the ALTQ queueing implementation for a number of queuing disciplines, notably RED and Blue. FreeBSD 11 included CoDel, PIE, FQ-CoDel and FQ-PIE queuing disciplines implementation in ipfw/dummynet framework with ECN marking capability.  Data Center TCP  Data Center Transmission Control Protocol (Data Center TCP or DCTCP) utilizes ECN to enhance the Transmission Control Protocol congestion control algorithm. It is used in data center networks. Whereas the standard TCP congestion control algorithm is only able to detect the presence of congestion, DCTCP, using ECN, is able to gauge the extent of congestion. DCTCP modifies the TCP receiver to always relay the exact ECN marking of incoming packets at the cost of ignoring a function that is meant to preserve signalling reliability. This makes a DCTCP sender vulnerable to loss of ACKs from the receiver, which it has no mechanism to detect or cope with. , algorithms that provide equivalent or better receiver feedback in a more reliable approach are an active research topic.

The second practising Jew to be a member of the British cabinet (the first being Herbert Samuel,Although Samuel's religious views were generally considered to be atheist, he remained an observant Jew to please his wife: see Isaacs could be considered the first believing Jew to be a member of the Cabinet. who was also a member of H. H. Asquith's government), Isaacs was the first Jew to be Lord Chief Justice, and the first, and as yet only, British Jew to be raised to a marquessate. Early life Isaacs was born in London, the son of a Jewish fruit importer at Spitalfields. He was educated at University College School and then entered the family business at the age of 15. In 1876‚Äì77 he served as a ship's boy and later worked as a jobber on the stock-exchange from 1880‚Äì84.  Career at the bar  Spy for Vanity Fair, 1904 Isaacs was admitted as a student to the Middle Temple in 1885, and was called to the Bar in 1887.The Concise Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 1992. He set up his own chambers at 1 Garden Court, Temple, and was very successful; within five years he was able to repay his creditors, and after twenty years at the bar earned the enormous sum of ¬£30,000 per year. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1898, after only ten and half years at the junior bar. Isaacs mainly practised in the Commercial Court, with occasional appearance in the divorce court or at the Old Bailey. Among his famous cases were the defence of The Star against a charge of libel by Arthur Chamberlain (at the behest of his brother Joseph), the Taff Vale case (where he appeared for the union), the 1903 Bayliss v. Coleridge libel suit, the prosecution of the fraudster Whitaker Wright, the defence of Sir Edward Russell on a charge of criminal libel, and that of Robert Sievier on a charge on blackmail. As a barrister, Isaacs was a hard worker, rising early to prepare his cases, although he never worked after dinner. His advocacy was calm and forensic, and he was renowned for his style of cross-examination. Political career in the House of Commons Having earlier contested unsuccessfully North Kensington in 1900, Isaacs entered the House of Commons as the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Reading at a by-election on 6 August 1904, a seat he held for nine years until 1913. In 1910, he was appointed Solicitor General in the government of H. H. Asquith and received the customary knighthood. After six months, he was appointed Attorney General. On the resignation of Lord Loreburn as Lord Chancellor in 1912, Isaacs had expected to succeed him, but was passed over in favour of Lord Haldane. To apease him, Asquith invited Isaacs to join the Cabinet; he was the first Attorney General to sit in the Cabinet. As law officer, Isaacs handled many high-profile cases. As Solicitor General, he appeared for the Admiralty in the George Archer-Shee case. As Attorney General, he led the prosecutions of Edward Mylius for criminal libel against George V (and was appointed KCVO shortly after), of poisoner Frederick Seddon (the only murder trial Isaacs ever took part in), and of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. He also represented the Board of Trade at the inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic. In addition, he helped to pilot through the Commons several pieces of key legislation, including the Parliament Act 1911, the Official Secrets Act 1911, the National Insurance Act 1911, the Trade Union Act 1913, and the Government of Ireland Act 1914. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1911 Coronation Honours.  The Marconi scandal  Isaacs was one of several high-ranking members of the Liberal government accused of involvement in the Marconi scandal.Lady Frances Lonsdale Donaldson, \\"The Marconi scandal\\", Harcourt, Brace & World, 1962 An article published in Le Matin on 14 February 1913 alleged corruption in the award of a government contract to the Marconi Company and insider trading in Marconi's shares, implicating a number of sitting government ministers, including Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; Isaacs, then Attorney General; Herbert Samuel, Postmaster General; and the Treasurer of the Liberal Party, the Master of Elibank, Lord Murray. The allegations included the fact that Isaacs' brother, Godfrey Isaacs, was managing director of the Marconi company at the time that the cabinet, in which Isaacs sat, awarded Marconi the contract.Harford Montgomery Hyde, \\"Lord Reading; the life of Rufus Isaacs, First Marquess of Reading\\", Heinemann, 1968, pages 124,138‚Äì140Stanley Jackson, \\"Rufus Isaacs, first marquess of Reading\\", Cassell, 1936, pages 167‚Äì172 Isaacs and Samuels sued Le Matin for libel, and as a result, the journal apologised and printed a complete retraction in its 18 February 1913 issue.Ian D.

Chesterton: A biography, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1986, , pages 204‚Äì205 The factual matters were at least partly resolved by a parliamentary select committee investigation, which issued three reports: all found that Isaacs and others had purchased shares in the American Marconi company, but while the fellow- Liberal members of the committee cleared the ministers of all blame, the opposition members reported that Isaacs and others had acted with \\"grave impropriety\\".W.J. Baker, \\"The history of the Marconi company 1874‚Äì1965\\", Routledge, 1998 , pages 144‚Äì146 It was not made public during the trial that these shares had been made available through Isaacs's brother at a favourable price.^ a b Michael Finch, G.K.

Albert Thomas (far left) visiting the Front, France. (photo: Ernest Brooks) In October 1913 he was made Lord Chief Justice of England, in succession to the Viscount Alverstone. At the time the Attorney General had the right of first refusal for the appointment, but his involvement in the Marconi scandal complicated matters. Although reluctant to abandon his political career Isaacs felt he had little choice: to refuse would be to suggest that the Marconi scandal had tainted him. Consequently, he accepted the post, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Reading, of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, on 9 January 1914. His appointment caused some controversy, and led to Rudyard Kipling attacking him in the poem \\"Gehazi\\". As Lord Chief Justice Reading presided over the trial of Roger Casement for high treason. His attendance in court was, however, intermittent, as he was frequently called upon by the government to serve as an advisor. In August 1914 Reading was enlisted to deal with the financial crisis brought about by the outbreak of the First World War. In 1915 he led the Anglo-French Financial Commission to seek financial assistance for the Allies from the United States. During the December 1916 Cabinet crisis, he acted as intermediary between Asquith and David Lloyd George. In September 1917 Reading returned to the United States with the special appointment of high commissioner to the United States and Canada. In 1918 he was appointed British Ambassador to the United States, all the while remaining Lord Chief Justice. Returning to England for six months in 1918, he frequently attended the War Cabinet and was sent to France as Lloyd George's confidential emissary. He returned to the United States as Ambassador in 1919, relinquishing the post the same year. After the excitement of wartime diplomacy, he returned unwillingly to the bench in 1919, while seeking new appointments. For his wartime public service he was appointed GCB in 1915, made Viscount Reading, of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire in 1916, and Earl of Reading as well as Viscount Erleigh, of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, in 1917.  Viceroy of India  Statue of Isaacs as Viceroy of India, originally sited in New Delhi but now in Eldon Square Gardens in Reading In 1921, he resigned the chief justiceship to become Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Reading preferred a conciliatory policy: he was determined to implement the provisions of the Government of India Act 1919 and opposed racial discrimination. He personally received Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and visited Amritsar as a gesture of reconciliation. However, he ended up using force on several occasions: in 1921 he ordered the suppression of the Malabar rebellion, and in 1922 he put down Sikh unrest in the Punjab. The same year, he had Gandhi arrested for sedition. Reading cultivated good relations with the Indian princes, but forced two maharajas to abdicate. On his return from India in 1926, he was made Marquess of Reading, the first man to raise from commoner to a marquessate since the Duke of Wellington. The next year he was made Captain of Deal Castle in 1927, a position he held until 1934. As Viceroy Reading was appointed GCSI and GCIE ex officio in 1921, and in 1922 was promoted to GCVO. As a former Viceroy, Reading was critical of some of the policies of his successor Lord Irwin. On 5 November 1929 he attacked Irwin in the House of Lords for using the term \\"Dominion Status\\" with regard to India, prior to the report of the Simon Commission.Jago 2015, pp.65-7, 70  Later life and career  alt=On his return from India, Reading, who had no pension and was a heavy spender, sat on several corporate boards, and later became president of Imperial Chemical Industries. The Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords from 1931‚Äì35, he took part in the Round Table Conferences of 1930‚Äì32 on the future of British India as head of the Liberal delegates. He was also a member of the select committee charged with the drafting of the Government of India Act 1935. In MacDonald's National Government in August 1931, Reading briefly served as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House of Lords, but stood down after the first major reshuffle in November due to ill-health. He was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1934.  Death  Lord Reading died in London in December 1935 aged 75. After cremation at Golders Green Crematorium his ashes were buried at the nearby Jewish cemetery. The house where he died, No. 32 Curzon Street in Mayfair, has had a blue plaque on it since 1971.  Assessment  In his approach to politics, Isaacs was, according to Denis Judd, > \\"no blood-red Radical, and had 'little sympathy with the narrower aspects of > the Nonconformist outlook which constituted so powerful an element in > contemporary Liberalism.' Liberalism, nonetheless, was the natural party for > him to support. Within his own father‚Äôs lifetime Jews had been obliged to > struggle to obtain full civil rights.

In 1925 he was appointed Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold.Royal Decree of 1925/-M√©morial du centenaire de l'Ordre de L√©opold. 1832-1932. Bruxelles, J. Rozez, 1933. He was Captain of Deal Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, received the freedom of Reading and of London, and was a Bencher and Treasurer of the Middle Temple. He received honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Toronto, Calcutta, Cambridge and Oxford. Although he had no apparent link with Canada, his eminence was such that the Lord Reading Law Society (founded in 1948 to promote the interests of Jewish members of the Quebec Bar) was named in his honour. A founding chairman of the Palestine Electric Corporation (along with Alfred Mond (father of his daughter in-law) and Herbert Samuel), the Reading Power Station in Tel Aviv, Israel was named in his honour.  Family  In 1887 he married Alice Edith Cohen, who suffered from a chronic physical disability and died of cancer in 1930, after over 40 years of marriage. The Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar is named after her. He then married Stella Charnaud, the first Lady Reading's secretary. His second marriage lasted until his own death in 1935. After his death Stella Isaacs was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1941, promoted to Dame Grand Cross (GBE) in 1944, and then in 1958 made a life peeress as Baroness Swanborough, of Swanborough in the County of Sussex.

He is one of only three people to have served as Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer, the others being Rab Butler and James Callaghan. He also served as Lord Chancellor, the most senior position in the British legal system. Beginning his career as a Liberal (identified initially with the left wing but later with the right wing of the party), he joined the National Government in 1931, creating the Liberal National Party in the process. At the end of his career, he was essentially a Conservative. Background and education Simon was born in a terraced house on Moss Side, Manchester, the eldest child and only sonJenkins 1999, p. 369, states that he was an only child. of Edwin Simon (1843‚Äì1920) and Fanny Allsebrook (1846‚Äì1936). His father was a Congregationalist, minister like three of his five brothers, and was pastor of Zion Chapel in Hulme, Manchester. His mother was a farmer's daughter and a descendant of Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury. Congregational ministers were expected to move about the country.Jenkins 1999, p. 369. Simon was educated at King Edward's School, Bath, as his father was President of Somerset Congregational Union. He was then a scholar of Fettes College in Edinburgh, where he was Head of School and won many prizes.Jenkins 1999, p. 370. He failed to win a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, but won an open scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford. He arrived at Wadham in 1892.Dutton 1992, pp. 7‚Äì9. He achieved Seconds in Mathematics and Classical Moderations. He spoke in support of Herbert Samuel for South Oxfordshire in the 1895 election and, after two terms as Junior Treasurer, became President of the Oxford Union in Hilary Term 1896, Simon won the Barstow Law Scholarship and graduated with a first in Greats in 1896. Simon's attendance at Wadham overlapped with those of F. E. Smith, the cricketer C. B. Fry and the journalist Francis Hirst. Smith, Fry and Simon played in the Wadham Rugby XV together.Jenkins 1999, p. 371. Simon and Smith began a rivalry that lasted throughout their legal and political careers over the next 30 years. Simon was, in David Dutton's view, a finer scholar than Smith. Although Smith thought Simon pompous, Simon, in the words of a contemporary, thought that Smith excelled at \\"the cheap score\\". A famous (although clearly untrue) malicious story had it that Smith and Simon had tossed a coin to decide which party to join.Jenkins 1999, p. 370. Jenkins states that Smith and Simon both started at Wadham on the same day in 1891, which is not supported by Dutton's more detailed biography. Simon was briefly a trainee leader writer for the Manchester Guardian under C. P. Scott. Simon shared lodgings with Leo Amery while both were studying for the All Souls Fellowship (both were successful). He became a Fellow of All Souls in 1897. Simon left Oxford at the end of 1898 and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1899. He was a pupil of A. J. Ram and then of Sir Reginald Acland. Like many barristers, his career got off to a slow start: he earned a mere ¬£27 in his first year at the bar. At first, he earned some extra money by coaching candidates for the bar exams. As a barrister, he relied on logic and reason rather than oratory and histrionics, and he excelled at simplifying complex issues. He was a brilliant advocate of complex cases before judges although rather less so before juries.Jenkins 1999, p. 367. Some of his work was done on the Western Circuit at Bristol. He worked exceptionally hard, often preparing his cases through the night several times a week. His initial lack of connections made his eventual success at the Bar all the more impressive. Simon was widowed in 1902 and took solace in his work. He became a successful lawyer, and in 1903, he acted for the British government in the Alaska boundary dispute. Even three years after his wife's death, he spent Christmas Day 1905 alone by walking aimlessly in France. Early political career Simon entered the House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Walthamstow at the 1906 general election. In 1908, he became a KC (senior barrister) at the same time as F. E. Smith. Simon annoyed Smith by not telling his rival in advance that he was applying for silk. In 1909, Simon spoke out strongly in Parliament in support of David Lloyd George's progressive \\"People's Budget\\". He entered the government on 7 October 1910 as solicitor-general, succeeding Rufus Isaacs, and was knighted later that month, as was then usual for government law officers (Asquith brushed aside his objections).Jenkins 1999, p. 372. At 37, he was the youngest solicitor-general since the 1830s. In February 1911, he successfully prosecuted Edward Mylius for criminal libel for claiming that King George V was a bigamist. As was then required by the law, he fought a by-election after his appointment. He was honoured with the KCVO in 1911. Asquith referred to him as \\"the Impeccable\\" for his intellectual self-assurance, but after a series of social encounters, he wrote that \\"The Impeccable\\" was becoming \\"The Inevitable\\".Jenkins 1999, p. 366. Along with Isaacs, Simon represented the Board of Trade at the public inquiry into the sinking of the in 1912; their close questioning of witnesses helped to prepare the way for improved maritime safety measures.Dutton 1992, p. 17. Unusually for a government law officer, he was active in partisan political debate. When F. E. Smith first spoke from the Conservative front bench in 1912, Simon was put up next to oppose his old rival. He was promoted on 19 October 1913 to attorney-general, again succeeding Isaacs. Unusually for an attorney-general, he was made a full member of Cabinet, as Isaacs had been, rather than simply being invited to attend when he was required. He was already being tipped as a potential future Liberal prime minister. He was the leader of the (unsuccessful) cabinet rebels against Winston Churchill's 1914 naval estimates. Asquith thought that Simon had organised \\"a conclave of malcontents\\" (Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna, Samuel, Charles Hobhouse and Beauchamp). He wrote to Asquith that the \\"loss of WC, though regrettable, is not by any means the splitting of the party\\". Lloyd George referred to Simon as \\"a kind of Robespierre\\".Jenkins 1999, p. 373. Simon contemplated resigning in protest at the declaration of war in August 1914 but, in the end, changed his mind. He was accused of hypocrisy even though his position was not actually very different to that of Lloyd George. He remained in the Cabinet after Asquith reminded him of his public duty and hinted at promotion. He damaged himself in the eyes of Hobhouse (postmaster- general), Charles Masterman and the journalist C. P. Scott. Roy Jenkins believed that Simon was genuinely opposed to war.Jenkins 1999, p. 374. Early in 1915, Asquith rated Simon as \\"equal seventh\\" in his score list of the Cabinet, after his \\"malaise of last autumn\\". Simon circa 1916 First World War On 25 May 1915, Simon became Home Secretary in Asquith's new coalition government. He declined an offer of the job of Lord Chancellor, which would have meant going to the Lords and restricting his active political career thereafter. As home secretary, he satisfied nobody. He tried to defend the Union of Democratic Control against Edward Carson's attempt to prosecute it. However, he tried to ban The Times and the Daily Mail for criticising the government's conduct of the war but failed to obtain Cabinet support.Jenkins 1999, p. 375. He resigned in January 1916 in protest against the introduction of conscription of single men, which he thought a breach of Liberal principles. McKenna and Walter Runciman also opposed conscription but for different reasons: they thought that it would weaken British industry and wanted Britain to concentrate her war effort on the Royal Navy and supporting the other Allies with finance. In his memoirs, Simon would admit that his resignation from the Home Office had been a mistake.Jenkins 1999, p. 376. After Asquith's fall in December 1916, Simon remained in opposition as an Asquithian Liberal. Simon proved his patriotism by serving as an officer on Trenchard's staff in the Royal Flying Corps for about a year, starting in the summer of 1917. His duties included purchasing supplies in Paris, where he married his second wife towards the end of 1917.Dutton 1992, p. 45. Amidst questions as to whether it was appropriate for a serving officer to do so, Simon spoke in Trenchard's defence in Parliament when Trenchard resigned as Chief of Air Staff after Trenchard had fallen out with the President of the Air Council Lord Rothermere, who soon resigned. However, Simon was attacked in the Northcliffe Press (Northcliffe was Rothermere's brother).Dutton 1992, p. 46. Dutton states erroneously that Trenchard resigned as Commander of the Royal Flying Corps, the position which Trenchard had held on the Western Front in 1916 to 1917. Simon's Walthamstow constituency was split up at the \\"Coupon Election\\" in 1918 and he was defeated at the new Walthamstow East division by a margin of more than 4,000 votes. 1920s Out of Parliament In 1919, he attempted to return to Parliament at the Spen Valley by-election. Lloyd George put up a coalition Liberal candidate in Spen Valley to keep Simon out and was active behind the scenes trying to see him defeated.Jenkins 1999, p. 377. Although the Coalition Liberals, who had formerly held the seat, were pushed into third place, Simon came second; in the view of Maurice Cowling (The Impact of Labour 1920-4), his defeat by Labour marked the point at which Labour began to be seen as a serious threat by the older political parties. Deputy leader of Liberals In the early 1920s, he practised successfully at the bar before being elected for Spen Valley at the general election in 1922, and from 1922 to 1924, he served as deputy leader of the Liberal Party (under Asquith).\\"London Correspondence\\", Glasgow Herald, 24 November 1922, p. 9.Dutton 1992, p. 59. In the early 1920s, he spoke in the House of Commons about socialism, the League of Nations, unemployment and Ireland. He may well have hoped to succeed Asquith as Liberal leader. He retired temporarily from the Bar around then.Jenkins 1999, p. 378. In October 1924, Simon moved the amendment that brought down the first Labour government. At that year's general election, the Conservatives were returned to power, and the Liberals were reduced to a rump of just over 40 MPs. Although Asquith, who had lost his seat, remained leader of the party, Lloyd George was elected chairman of the Liberal MPs by 29 votes to 9. Simon abstained in the vote. By this time he was increasingly anti-socialist and quite friendly to the Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin and clashed increasingly with Lloyd George. He stood down as deputy leader and returned to the Bar. General strike and Simon Commission Unlike Lloyd George, Simon opposed the 1926 general strike. On 6 May, the fourth day of the strike, he declared in the House of Commons that the strike was illegal and argued that it was not entitled to the legal privileges of the Trade Disputes Act 1906 and that the union bosses would be \\"liable to the utmost farthing\\" in damages for the harm that they inflicted on businesses and for inciting the men to break their contracts of employment. Simon was highly respected as an authority on the law but was neither popular nor seen as a political leader.Jenkins 1999, p. 379. Simon was then one of the highest-paid barristers of his generation and was believed to earn between ¬£36,000 and ¬£70,000 per annum (around ¬£2m‚Äì¬£3.5m at 2016 prices). It seemed for a while that he might abandon politics altogether. Simon spoke for Newfoundland in the Labrador boundary dispute with Canada before he announced his permanent retirement from the Bar.Jenkins 1999, p. 380. From 1927 to 1931, he chaired the Indian Constitutional Development Committee, known as the Simon Commission, on the constitution of India.Jenkins 1999, p. 381. His personality was already something of an issue: Neville Chamberlain wrote of him to the Viceroy of India Lord Irwin (12 August 1928): \\"I am always trying to like him, and believing I shall succeed when something crops up to put me off\\".Jenkins, Roy The Chancellors (London: Macmillan, 1998), pp. 366‚Äì67. Dutton describes Simon's eventual report as a \\"lucid exposition of the problems of the subcontinent in all their complexity\\". However, Simon had been hampered by the inquiry's terms of reference (no Indians had been included on the committee), and his conclusions were overshadowed by the Irwin Declaration of October 1929, which Simon opposed, which promised India eventual dominion status. Simon was appointed GSCI 1930. Liberal National split and moving towards Conservatives Before serving on the committee, Simon had obtained a guarantee that he would not be opposed by a Conservative candidate at Spen Valley at the 1929 general election, and, indeed he was never again opposed by a Conservative.Jenkins 1999, pp. 377, 381. During the late 1920s and especially during the 1929-31 Parliament, in which Labour had no majority but continued in office with the help of the Liberals, Simon was seen as the leader of the minority of Liberal MPs who disliked Lloyd George's inclination to support Labour, rather than the Conservatives. Simon still supported free trade during the 1929-31 Parliament. In 1930, Simon headed the official inquiry into the R101 airship disaster. In June 1931, before the formation of the National Government, Simon resigned the Liberal whip. In September, Simon and his 30-or-so followers became the Liberal Nationals (later renamed the \\"National Liberals\\") and increasingly aligned themselves with the Conservatives for practical purposes. Simon was accused by Lloyd George of leaving \\"the slime of hypocrisy\\" as he crossed the floor (on another occasion, Lloyd George is said to have commented that he had \\"sat on the fence so long the iron has entered into his soul\\", but this quote is more difficult to verify). 1930s: National Government Foreign Secretary Simon was not initially included in Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, which was formed in August 1931. Simon offered to give up his seat at Spen Valley to MacDonald if the latter had trouble holding Seaham (MacDonald held the seat in 1931 but lost it in 1935).Jenkins 1999, p. 382. On 5 November 1931, Simon was appointed Foreign Secretary when the National Government was reconstituted. The appointment was at first greeted with acclaim. Simon's Liberal Nationals continued to support protectionism and Ramsay MacDonald's National Government after the departure of the mainstream Liberals, led by Herbert Samuel, who left the government in 1932 and formally went into Opposition in November 1933. Simon's tenure of office saw a number of important events in foreign policy, including the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, which had begun in September 1931, before he had taken office. Simon attracted particular opprobrium for his speech to the General Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva on 7 December 1932 in which he failed to denounce Japan unequivocally.Douglas Reed, All Our Tomorrows (1942), p. 62: Geneva, 1931, \\"Sir John Simon congratulated by the Japanese emissary for presentation of Japan's case against China\\". Thereafter, Simon was known as the \\"Man of Manchukuo\\" and was compared unfavourably to the young Anthony Eden, who was popular at Geneva.Jenkins 1999, p. 384. Also then was the coming to power of Adolf Hitler in Germany in January 1933. Hitler immediately withdrew Germany from the League of Nations and announced a programme of rearmament, initially to give Germany armed forces commensurate with France and other powers. Simon did not foresee the sheer scale of Hitler's ambitions, but Dutton pointed out, the same was then true for many others. Simon's term of office also saw the failure of the World Disarmament Conference (1932-1934). His contribution was not entirely in vain since he proposed qualitative (seeking to limit or ban certain types of weapon), rather than quantitative (simple numbers of weapons), disarmament. Simon does not appear to have been considered for the post of Chancellor of Oxford University in succession to Viscount Grey in 1933 since Simon was then at the depth of his unpopularity as Foreign Secretary. Lord Irwin was elected, and since he lived until 1959, the job did not fall vacant again in Simon's lifetime.Jenkins 1999, p. 392. There was talk of Neville Chamberlain, who dominated the government's domestic policy, becoming Foreign Secretary, but that would have been intolerable to MacDonald, who took a keen interest in foreign affairs and wanted a leading non-Conservative in that role. In 1933 and late 1934, Simon was being criticised by both Austen and Neville Chamberlain as well as by Eden, Lloyd George, Nancy Astor, David Margesson, Vincent Massey, Runciman, Jan Smuts and Churchill. Simon accompanied MacDonald to negotiate the Stresa Front with France and Italy in April 1935, but it was MacDonald who took the lead in the negotiations. Simon himself did not think that Stresa would stop German rearmament but thought that it might be a useful deterrent against territorial aggression by Hitler.Dutton 1992, p. 220. The first stirrings of Italian aggression towards Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) were also then seen. During Simon's tenure of the Foreign Office, British defence strength was at its lowest point of the interwar period, which severely limited his freedom of action. Even Simon's colleagues thought that he had been a disastrous Foreign Secretary, \\"the worst since √Üthelred the Unready\\", as one wag put it. He was better at analysing a problem than at concluding and acting. Jenkins commented that he was a bad Foreign Secretary in the view of his contemporaries and ever since and concurs that he was better at analysing than solving. Neville Chamberlain thought he always sounded as though he was speaking from a brief.Jenkins 1999, p. 383. Simon's officials despaired of him since he had few thoughts of his own, solutions were imposed on him by others and he defended them only weakly.Jenkins 1999, p. 368. Leo Amery was a rare defender of Simon's record: in 1937, he recorded that Simon ‚Äúreally had been a sound foreign minister ‚Äì and Stresa marked the nearest Europe has been to peace since 1914‚Äù.Dutton 1992, p. 207. Home Secretary Simon served as Home Secretary (in Stanley Baldwin's Third Government) from 7 June 1935 to 28 May 1937. That position was in Dutton's view better suited to his abilities than the Foreign Office. He also became Deputy Leader of the House of Commons on the understanding that the latter position would be given to Neville Chamberlain after the election (in the event, it was not).Jenkins 1999, p. 385. In 1935, Simon was the last Home Secretary to attend a royal birth (of the present Duke of Kent). He passed the Public Order Act 1936, restricting the activities of Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts. He also played a key role behind the scenes in the 1936 Abdication Crisis. He also introduced the Factories Act 1937. Simon was devoted to his mother and wrote a well-received Portrait of My Mother in 1936 after her death. Chancellor of the Exchequer Peace In 1937, Neville Chamberlain succeeded Baldwin as prime minister. Simon succeeded Chamberlain as Chancellor of the Exchequer and was raised to GCVO in 1937. As Chancellor, he tried to keep arms spending as low as possible in the belief that a strong economy was the \\"fourth arm of defence\\". In 1937, he presented a finance bill that was based on the budget that Chamberlain had drawn up before being promoted.Jenkins 1999, p. 388. In 1938, public expenditure passed the previously-unthinkable level of ¬£1,000m for the first time. In the spring 1938 budget, Simon raised the income tax from 5s to 5s 6d and increased duties on tea and petrol. Simon had become a close political ally of Chamberlain and flattered him a great deal. In the autumn of 1938, he led the Cabinet to Heston Airport to wish him God speed on his flight to meet Hitler, and he helped to persuade Chamberlain to make the \\"high\\" case for Munich: that he had achieved a lasting peace, rather than that he had only limited potential damage.Jenkins 1999, p. 386. He retained the support of Chamberlain until around the middle of 1939. In the spring 1939 budget, income tax was unchanged, and the surtax was increased, as were indirect taxes on cars, sugar and tobacco. It was not a war budget even though Hitler had already broken the Munich Accords by occupying Prague. War On 2 September 1939, Simon led a deputation of ministers to see Chamberlain to insist for Britain to honour her guarantee to Poland and go to war if Hitler did not withdraw. Simon became a member of the small War Cabinet. On the outbreak of war, sterling was devalued, with very little attention, from $4.89 to $4.03. At the emergency budget of September 1939, public expenditure had passed ¬£2,000m; income tax was increased from 5s 6d (27.5%) to 7s 6d (37.5%); duties on alcohol, petrol and sugar were hiked; and a 60% tax on excess profits was introduced. Simon's political position weakened as he came to be seen as a symbol of foot-dragging and the lack of commitment to total war. Along with Labour's dislike of Chamberlain, he was used as an excuse by the opposition parties for not joining the government on the outbreak of war. Archibald Sinclair, the leader of the \\"official\\" Liberal Party, said that for over seven years, Simon had been \\"the evil genius of British foreign policy\\". Hugh Dalton and Clement Attlee were very critical of Simon, as were many government backbenchers.Jenkins 1999, p. 389. Chamberlain privately told colleagues that he found Simon \\"very much deteriorated\\". Simon's position weakened after Churchill rejoined the Cabinet on the outbreak of war and got on surprisingly well with Chamberlain, who toyed with the idea of replacing Simon with former Chancellor Reginald McKenna (then aged 76) or Lord Stamp, the chairman of the LMS Railway who had a secret meeting at Downing Street about the position. Even Captain Margesson, the Chief Whip, fancied his chances for the position. Simon's last budget, in April 1940, saw public spending pass ¬£2,700m, 46% of which was paid for from taxation and the rest from borrowing. Simon's April 1940 budget kept income tax at 7s 6d; a Punch cartoon expressed a widely-held view that it should have been increased to 10s (50%). Tax allowances were increased. Postal charges were increased, as were charges on tobacco, matches and alcohol. The purchase tax, an ancestor of today's value-added tax (VAT), was introduced. In April 1940, he rejected John Maynard Keynes' idea of a forced loan, a tax disguised as a compulsory purchase of government securities. Keynes wrote a coruscating letter of rebuke to The Times. Simon found himself criticised, from opposite ends of the spectrum, by Leo Amery and Aneurin Bevan.Jenkins 1999, p. 390. Lord Chancellor In May 1940, after the Norway Debate, Simon urged Chamberlain to stand firm as Prime Minister although Simon offered to resign and take Samuel Hoare with him. By 1940, Simon, along with his successor as Foreign Secretary, Hoare, had come to be seen as one of the \\"Guilty Men\\" responsible for appeasement of the dictators, and like Hoare, Simon was not regarded as acceptable in the War Cabinet of Churchill's new coalition. Hugh Dalton thought Simon \\"the snakiest of the lot\\". Simon became Lord Chancellor in Churchill's government but without a place on the War Cabinet. Attlee commented that he ‚Äúwill be quite innocuous‚Äù in the role.At the time, besides being Minister in charge of the judiciary, the Lord Chancellor was also Speaker of the House of Lords and was himself the most senior judge. He sat as one of the Law Lords, the senior judges who carried out the judicial functions of the House of Lords. They were a predecessor to today's Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. On 13 May 1940, he was created Viscount Simon, of Stackpole Elidor in the County of Pembroke, a village from which his father traced descent. In Dutton's view, of all the senior positions which he held, that was the one for which he was most suited. As Lord Chancellor, he delivered important judgements on the damages due for death caused by negligence and on how the judge ought to direct the jury in a murder trial if a possible defence of manslaughter arose. In 1943 alone, he delivered 43 major judgements on complex cases. RVF Heuston (Lives of the Lord Chancellors) described him as a ‚Äúsuperb‚Äù Lord Chancellor. Jenkins comments that it is even more impressive in that many senior judges had over 20 years' experience at that level, whereas Simon had been retired from the law since 1928.Jenkins 1999, p. 391. Simon interrogated Rudolf Hess, who had flown to Scotland, and also chaired the Royal Commission on the Birthrate. In May 1945, after the end of the wartime coalition, Simon continued as Lord Chancellor but was not included in the Cabinet of the short-lived Churchill caretaker ministry. After Churchill's defeat in the 1945 general election, Simon never held office again. Later life Although he had won plaudits for his legal skills as Lord Chancellor, Clement Attlee declined to appoint him to the British delegation at the Nuremberg War Trials and told him bluntly in a letter that Simon's role in the prewar governments made it unwise. Simon remained active in the House of Lords and as a senior judge on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He wrote a well-regarded practitioners' text Simon on Income Tax in 1948. In 1948, Simon succeeded Lord Sankey as High Steward of Oxford University. The position is often held by a distinguished Oxonian lawyer. Relations with his nearly-alcoholic wife were somewhat strained, and he increasingly spent his weekends at All Souls, of which he was Senior Fellow. Simon was a vigorous campaigner against socialism, across the country in the general elections of 1945, 1950 and 1951. Churchill blocked Simon, who had stepped down as leader of the National Liberals in 1940, from joining the Conservative Party. Churchill was keen to lend Conservative support to the (official) Liberals, including his old friend Lady Violet Bonham Carter, but blocked a full merger between the Conservatives and the National Liberals although a constituency-level merger was negotiated with the Conservative Party chairman Lord Woolton in 1947 (thereafter, the National Liberals were increasingly absorbed into the Conservatives for practical purposes until they fully merged in 1968). Although Simon was still physically and mentally vigorous (aged 78) when the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, Churchill offered him neither a return to the Woolsack nor any other office. In 1952, Simon published his memoirs, Retrospect. The quote \\"I so very tire of politics. The early death of too many a great man is attributed to her touch\\" is from Simon's memoir. Harold Nicolson reviewed the book as describing the \\"nectarines and peaches of office\\" as if they were \\"a bag of prunes\\". Simon died from a stroke on 11 January 1954. He was an atheist and was cremated in his Oxford robes. His estate was valued for probate at ¬£93,006 12s (around ¬£2.3m at 2016 prices). Despite his huge earnings at the Bar, he was not particularly greedy for money and was generous to All Souls, to junior barristers and to the children of friends. His personal papers are preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Private life and personality Dame Kathleen Simon, Viscountess Simon (17 February 1920) Simon married Ethel Mary Venables, a niece of the historian J. R. Green, on 24 May 1899 in Headington, Oxfordshire. They had three children: Margaret (born 1900, who later married Geoffrey Edwards), Joan (born 1901, who later married John Bickford-Smith) and John Gilbert, 2nd Viscount Simon (1902‚Äì1993). Ethel died soon after the birth of their son Gilbert, in September 1902. There are some suggestions that his first wife's death may have been caused by misguided use of homeopathic medicines, which added to Simon's guilt. In Jenkins' view, widowerhood, although common for politicians of the era, may have affected Simon's cold personality. He later apparently tried to persuade Margaret Greville, the hostess of Polesden Lacey, to marry him. Greville later claimed that he had told her that he would marry the next woman he met.Dutton 1992, pp. 325‚Äì6. In 1917, in Paris, Simon married the abolition activist Kathleen Manning (1863/64‚Äì1955), a widow with one adult son, who had for a while been governess to his children. Her social gaucheness and inability to play the part of a great lady caused embarrassment on the Simon Commission in the late 1920s, and Neville Chamberlain found her \\"a sore trial\\". She had increasing health problems and \\"dr[ank] to excess\\" as she grew older. Jenkins wrote that she was tactless and, by the late 1930s, had become a virtual alcoholic but that Simon treated her with \\"tolerance and kindness\\". In 1938, Simon stepped down at Spen Valley and was selected as candidate for Great Yarmouth since he needed a seat nearer London for the sake of his wife's health (in the event, he never stood for his new seat but remained MP for Spen Valley until his elevation to the Lords in 1940). Simon bought De Lisle Manor in Fritwell, Oxfordshire, in 1911 and lived there until 1933. He was an avid chess player and frequently sought for as a dignitary to open major chess tournaments in England.https://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/simon.html Simon was neither liked nor trusted, and he was never seriously considered for prime ministerJenkins 1999, p. 365. (however, political realities would have made it all but impossible for anyone outside the Conservative Party to have led the National Government after MacDonald's retirement). He possessed an unfortunately chilly manner, and from at least 1914 onwards, he had difficulty in conveying an impression that he was acting from honourable motives. His awkward attempts to strike up friendships with his colleagues (asking his Cabinet colleagues to call him \\"Jack\\": only J. H. Thomas did so, and Neville Chamberlain settled on \\"John\\") often fell flat.Jenkins, Roy The Chancellors (London: Macmillan, 1998), p. 366. Jenkins likens him to the nursery rhyme character Dr Fell.Jenkins 1999, p. 369: \\"I do not like thee Dr Fell, the reason why I cannot tell, but this I know and know full well, I do not like thee Dr Fell\\". In the 1930s, his reputation sank particularly low. Although Simon's athletic build and good looks were remarked on even into his old age, the cartoonist David Low portrayed him with, in Low's own words, a \\"sinuous writhing body\\" to reflect his \\"disposition to subtle compromise\\". Harold Nicolson, after Simon had grabbed his arm from behind to talk to him (19 October 1944), wrote pithily \\"God what a toad and a worm Simon is!\\" Another anecdote, from the late 1940s, tells how the socialist intellectual G. D. H. Cole got into a third-class compartment on the train back from Oxford to London to break off conversation with Simon; to his dismay, Simon followed suit, only for both men to produce first-class tickets when the inspector did his rounds.

The country park is centred on the former hunting lodge, a folly designed to be seen from the now demolished Hamilton Palace at the end of a broad grass slope forming an avenue with lines of lime trees. The lodge was designed by William Adam and completed in 1734. It comprises two buildings, linked by a gateway, in the form of four pavilions above a garden wall. The north facade was visible from the palace and forms the front of the building. To the rear are formal parterre gardens. The buildings provided kennels, stables and accommodation for hunting parties returning from the woodlands to the south. Adam jokingly referred to his creation as 'The Dogg Kennel'. From 1591, Hamilton Palace became the main residence of the Dukes of Hamilton. Rebuilding as the largest country house in Scotland with an imposing Palladian south front began in 1684, then from 1822 Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton had the palace considerably enlarged as a setting for a major art collection, with the north front designed by David Hamilton. Due to debts the art collection was sold in 1882, and the family moved out. In 1889 the 12th Duke leased out coal mining under the Low Parks, and further leasing in 1915 extended the mines under the house itself, causing subsidence to the palace which was sold for demolition in 1921. The ground in front of the lodge was excavated for sand quarrying. The resulting subsidence has created a noticeably lopsided feel in the lodge: coins will roll across the floor, and many visitors report feeling unbalanced and ill. The quarrying was halted in the 1970s, following the death of the 14th Duke. The High and Low parks of Hamilton were given to the nation in lieu of death duties. Historic Scotland began renovating the lodge in the late 1970s, including the fine Georgian plasterwork, and a visitor centre was built to the rear. The lodge and park were opened to the public in 1987Chatelherault Country Park opened to the public 30 years ago today, Daily Record, 30 September 2017 and are now managed by South Lanarkshire Council. The ruins of Cadzow Castle lie above the gorge of the Avon Water, which runs to the west of the lodge. The bulk of the park lies along the Avon gorge, with woodland walks and cycle routes. A herd of Cadzow cattle live in the fields overlooked by the hunting lodge. This apparently unique breed have white coats and long horns. In December 2005, access to Chatelherault Country Park was improved with the opening of Chatelherault railway station near to the entrance of the park. This provides two trains from Glasgow (via Hamilton) per hour. From July 2017 a programme commenced to remove a large area of non-native conifers from the around the hunting lodge opening views onto the Duke‚Äôs Bridge, Cadzow Castle and the Avon Gorge.

Design work began in 1971. The rounded shape and large glass area were unusual compared with the three-box designs of the era. The Pacer's width is equal to full- sized domestic vehicles at the time, and this unique design feature was promoted by AMC as \\"the first wide small car.\\" The Pacer was the first modern, mass-produced, U.S. automobile design using the cab forward concept. The Pacer's rounded and aerodynamic \\"jellybean\\" styling has made it an icon of the 1970s. The body surface was 37% glass, and its surface area of was 16% more than the average passenger car at the time.Joe Ligo: The Unfortunate History of the AMC Pacer, 2013 The May 1976 issue of Car and Driver dubbed it \\"The Flying Fishbowl,\\" and it was also described as \\"the seventies answer to George Jetson's mode of transportation\\" at a time when \\"Detroit was still rolling out boat-sized gas guzzlers.\\" Design American Motors' chief stylist Dick Teague began work on the Pacer in 1971, anticipating an increase in demand for smaller vehicles through the decade. The new car was designed to offer the interior room and feel of a big car that drivers of traditional domestic automobiles were accustomed to, but in a much smaller, aerodynamic and purposefully distinctive exterior package. American Motors called it \\"Project Amigo\\" as a fresh design \\"featuring a body style not seen before, using the latest technology and exceeding upcoming safety regulations.\\" Car and Driver magazine noted that \\"AMC said it was the first car designed from the inside out. Four passengers were positioned with reasonable clearances and then the rest of the car was built around them as compactly as possible.\\" The shape was highly rounded with a huge glass area and was very unusual for its time. Road & Track magazine described it as \\"fresh, bold and functional-looking\\". Development was under Product Group Vice President Gerald C. Meyers, whose goal was to develop a car that was unique: \\"everything that we do must distinguish itself as being importantly different than what can be expected from the competition.\\" Even before its introduction, AMC's Board Chairman Roy D. Chapin, Jr. described \\"It will be a visibly different car, maybe even controversial. It's an idea that represents a transition between what has been and what's coming. Today versus tomorrow.\\" According to Popular Mechanics, \\"This is the first time in the history of the American automobile industry that a car manufacturer has said in advance of bringing out a new product that some people may not like it.\\" Pacer's design of dashboard for safety and ease of service instrument panel Isolated wishbone front suspension Hidden windshield wipers A number of futuristic ideas were explored by AMC, but the automaker lacked adequate resources to build components from scratch. Instead, they needed to use outside suppliers or adapt certain existing parts for use in their own production facilities. Unique for a comparatively small car, the Pacer was as wide as a full-size American car of the era. American Motors did not describe it as \\"cab forward,\\" but the Pacer's layout included wheels pushed to the corners (short overhangs), a relatively wide body, and A-pillars moved forward. The windshield was placed over part of the engine compartment, with the bottom edge of the glass forward of the firewall. Contrary to myth, the Pacer was not widened six inches (152.4 mm) to make room for the rear- wheel drive configuration. The editor of Road & Track asserted that front- wheel drive, as well as a transverse mid-engined configuration, were among \\"various mechanical layouts ... tossed around by the idea people at AMC,\\" adding that \\"it's unlikely they ever had much hope of being able to produce anything other than their traditional front engine and rear drive, using components already in production.\\" The introductory 1975 AMC advertising and literature proclaimed it as \\"the first wide small car.\\" The width was dictated partly by marketing strategy‚ÄîAmerican drivers were accustomed to large vehicles and the Pacer's occupants had the impression of being in a larger car‚Äîand partly by the fact that AMC's assembly lines were already set up for full-size cars. Teague's low-drag design, which predated the fuel crisis and the flood of small foreign imports into the American market, was highly innovative. Pacer's drag coefficient of 0.43 was relatively low for that time. Teague even eliminated rain gutters, smoothly blending the tops of the doors into the roof‚Äîan aerodynamic detail that, although criticized at the time for allowing rain onto the front seat, has become the norm in today's designs. Also unique was that the passenger door was four inches (101 mm) longer than the driver's. This made passenger loading easier, particularly from the rear seats; and they would also tend to use the safer curbside in countries that drive on the right. An entirely fresh approach was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It was the first U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm at the bottom and in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings in and out of the mounting brackets. Other aspects of the Pacer were designed for ease of service, including the dashboard and instrument panel‚Äîusing a minimum number of easily accessible screws and featuring removable cover/bezel without the need to disconnect the speedometer cable‚Äîand access to the light bulbs. The Pacer's design was ranked as equal with the new Aspen-Volare compacts as the most serviceable in the industry. The Pacer was the second American production car, after the Ford Pinto, to feature rack-and-pinion steering. The system was mounted low at the front of the crossmember. The body was designed with the aim that structural lines protected it from hit damage and AMC engineers claimed that they succeeded in more than 50% of the car surface. Roll bar roof bump, 1975 Pacer X Controversial styling with large glass area In the mid-1970s, the U.S. government mandated major safety improvements for vehicles starting with the 1980 model year. These included front-end crash testing, side crash testing, and rollover testing, as well as the installation of bumpers that would resist a impact at the front and at the rear. \\"Full-circle body protection was designed into the Pacer, starting with the energy- absorbing bumper mounts\\" through upper and lower box-section rails on each side extending back to the front pillars, as well as from the bases of the pillars behind the doors, the box-section members in the body floor curve up and back in past the rear wheel houses. The Pacer was designed from the start to meet the expected stringent safety specifications. The low beltline and window design afforded the driver with outstanding visibility. The Pacer had laminated safety glass in the windshield. The articulated front wipers were hidden when in their parked position, and a rear wiper and washer was optional. D/L coupe, before front end restyle Restyled 1979 D/L coupe General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler persuaded the government that it was not financially viable to modify existing production cars to comply with the new regulations, and that instead each company would be put to the enormous expense of producing new, safety-compliant vehicles. Accordingly, the government requirements were reduced, which led to the deletion of several safety features from the production Pacer‚Äîfor example the roll bar over the passenger compartment, and the bump in the roof that accommodated it. The design of the Pacer was strong for a small car, making it solid and heavy with protection features that included strong and massive bumpers, as well as wide B-pillars that factory information bulletins described their \\"roll bar like characteristics.\\" Even with the Pacer's large glass area, passengers are not near the windows because they all bow out from around the occupants. The Pacer's wide stance also makes it stable and provides a unique feeling when inside the car, giving credence to the marketing phrase used by AMC that \\"you only ride like a Pacer if you're wide like a Pacer.\\" The editors of The Motor opined the \\"more you study both the general layout and the detail features of the Pacer, the more convinced you become that the men who dreamed it up and decided to make it actually do drive around in crowded cities and consequently realise from their own experience that the traditional big barges are less and less easy to navigate through our streets.\\" Car and Driver road testers noted the Pacer's \\"smooth and quiet ride can probably be attributed to a front subframe that isolates the passenger capsule from engine, suspension and steering loads\\" making the car \\"eminently stable and controllable, with its rack-and-pinion steering and wide track.\\" The Pacer's remaining safety features were not strongly advertised, and seldom influenced a potential customer's purchasing decision. The car's extra weight‚Äîdue in part to the safety equipment and the abundance of heavy glass‚Äîhurt fuel economy: production models tested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave in the city, but or better on the highway (depending on driving habits and transmission), thanks to aerodynamic efficiency. Originally, the car was designed for a Wankel rotary engine. In 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with Curtiss-Wright to build Wankels for cars and Jeep-type vehicles. (The agreement also permitted Curtiss-Wright to sell rotaries elsewhere.) Later, AMC decided instead to purchase the engines from General Motors (GM), who were developing them for use in their own cars. However, GM canceled development in 1974 for reasons that included durability issues, the fuel crisis, tooling costs (for the engines and also for a new product line designed to take advantage of the rotary's ultra-compact dimensions) and the upcoming (late 1970s) U.S. emissions legislation. It was also thought that the high-revving Wankel would not suit Americans accustomed to low revs and high torque. General Motors's change of plans left the Pacer without an engine. American Motors took a calculated risk and introduced the new model. The company's over commitment to the project resulted in entrapment with so much money and effort in the car's design. Engineers hastily reconfigured it to accept their existing straight-six engine. This involved a complete redesign of drivetrain and firewall to keep the longer engine within the body dimensions designed for the Wankel, but allowed the Pacer to share many mechanical components with other AMC models. Newsweek noted the \\"Pacer's primary competitive drawback is gasoline mileage: AMC offers only six-cylinder engines and the car gets only 18 miles per gallon in city and suburban driving vs. 23 mpg or more for some four-cylinder competitors.\\" The \\"outside of the box\\" thinking incorporated by AMC in the Pacer as the first \\"wide, small car\\" attempted to capture a revolutionary change in marketplace, but a radical departure from what was accepted by consumers as \\"good styling\\" was a risky strategy. Only the largest firms can stick with a radical element until it \\"grows,\\" and the automaker's dominance in the marketplace may eventually establish it as a standard feature. However, by the late 1970s the styling research axiom no longer applied that if a car with some controversial styling was liked by at least half of the potential market segment; then chances were good that this feature was a differential advantage for the manufacturer. The AMC Pacer incorporated many controversial styling and design innovations that led to its market failure after five model years. American Motors created the Pacer by identifying emerging trends and design technologies, but it faced a small window of opportunity since a product that comes out either too early or too late can fail even if the opportunity was there initially. A further complication was the purchasing dynamics and the Pacer's design was focused on maximizing the internal sense of space, while the market focused on external dimensions. Many of the attributes the Pacer incorporated became the goal of all manufacturers in the two decades that followed. With an uncommonly wide and short body for a small car, the Pacer's design is still considered controversial while its powerplants did not contribute to fuel economy. Nevertheless, \\"the foresight by Teague and AMC was correct\\" with approaches to meet the evolving U.S. government regulations covering automobiles (such as the Highway Safety Act of 1970 and the new National Highway Traffic Safety Administration).The \\"1975 AMC Pacer\\" display tag at the Antique Auto Museum at Hershey, PA. viewed in March 2009. Production 1978 station wagon Wagon model Introduced in showrooms on 28 February 1975, the Pacer was designed to attract buyers of traditional large cars to a smaller package during a time when gasoline prices were projected to rise dramatically. In its first year of production, the Pacer sold well, with 145,528 units. There was little competition from other American manufacturers, most of whom had been blindsided by the oil crisis. The increased demand for compact, economy vehicles was growing rapidly. However, Pacer sales fell after the first two years, though the car continued to be built through the 1980 model year. Similar to its mid-year introduction, on 3 December 1979, production of the Pacer ended at the Kenosha, Wisconsin assembly plant where it had begun five years earlier. A total of 280,000 cars were built. Increasing competition from the Big Three U.S. automakers and the rapid consumer shift to imported cars during the late 1970s are cited as the reasons for this outcome. Automobile buyers in the U.S. became adjusted to smaller and lighter cars, particularly the imports that offered better gas mileage presented, the AMC Pacer could not match the German and Japanese cars. Also the large glass areas increased the car's weight. With 22 miles per gallon the Pacer was unattractive for customers in the 1979 energy crisis. AMCs partnership with Renault brought the Renault 5 named \\"Le Car\\" to the AMC dealers. The design of the Pacer gave a little touch to the restyling of the Renault 5 to meet wishes and requirements of the American Market. The Pacer's unconventional styling was commonly cited in its lack of success. Other concerns included a lack of cargo space when carrying a full load of passengers (because of its short wheelbase). Cargo space could be increased to by folding down the back of the rear seat to form a flat floor. Drivers also cited a lack of power. The Pacer was heavy; Car & Driver wrote, \\"American Motors had already quoted a curb weight of 2990 lb. for the basic Pacer when we first wrote about the car, and that already seemed quite heavy; but when we weighed the test car (whose air conditioning, automatic transmission, power steering and so forth would not account for the full difference) it registered an astounding 3425 lb.\\", and the standard I6, with a single-barrel carburetor and optimized for low emissions (all vehicles at the time carried emissions-reducing devices, including exhaust gas recirculation); was relatively low-powered (\\"The Pacer comes with either of two AMC inline six-cylinder engines, both producing 100 bhp, but the larger 258-cu-in. unit delivering better mid-range torque\\"). In 1976, a \\"High Output\\" version of the engine was offered, which helped performance at the cost of higher fuel consumption. By the time a V8 was offered in 1978, the company had introduced a successful line of \\"luxury-compact\\" models (the AMC Concord). Additionally, gasoline prices remained high, limiting demand for V8-powered vehicles. For increased cargo capacity, a station wagon body style was offered from 1977. The wagon version was only five inches longer (127 mm) and weighed only more than the coupe. It was also a less unusual-looking design with a squared-off back and straight, almost upright, rear side windows. Although front vent windows were optional on all Pacers, the wagon's rear side glass featured vent windows as standard. The broad and rear liftgate opened to a wide, flat cargo area with of space, significantly easing the task of loading cargo. The rear seat also folded flat to form a continuation of the cargo floor. Some wagon models featured simulated woodgrain trim on the lower body sides and the liftgate. Model designations 1979 D/L The Pacer started out as an economy car, and eventually became a small luxury car. The following information details some of the highlights. The \\"X\\" Package: Available as the Pacer X from 1975 to 1978 in coupe form, this version was renamed Sport in 1978 and subsequently eliminated. The trim package consisted of vinyl bucket seats, sports steering wheel and custom trim, as well as a floor-mounted gear shift and front sway bar. The model received exterior chrome features, styled road wheels, Pacer X decals on the doors, and other package identification. The \\"D/L\\" Package: A more upscale edition, the D/L was available for the entire run of the car and became the base model in 1978. The package originally included \\"Navajo design\\" seating fabric and a woodgrain instrument panel as well as some interior features that were otherwise optional. The exterior had additional chrome accents, different wheel covers, and identification badging. The \\"Limited\\": Available in 1979‚Äì1980, the Limited had leather seats, extra soundproofing, and deeper-pile carpet (18-oz. vs. the standard 12-oz) as standard, plus amenities that were otherwise options, including: AM radio, power door locks, power windows, and tilt steering wheel. The exterior had chrome accents, styled road wheels, and \\"Limited\\" badging. The \\"Sundowner\\": Available through AMC dealers in California for 1975 only, the Sundowner was a basic $3,599 (suggested retail price) Pacer with options that listed for $300 included at no extra cost. In addition to the mandatory California engine emissions controls and bumper guards, the package included \\"Basketry Weave\\" fabric upholstery with coordinated trim on the door panels, plus remote control exterior mirror, rear window washer and wiper, styled road wheels with whitewall tires, and a roof rack. The \\"Levi's\\" Package: Introduced for 1977 to capitalize on the popularity of the Levi's Gremlin and Hornet, the Levi's Pacer had blue denim-like upholstery and door-panel trim, with small Levi's tags on the front seats. The copper buttons in AMC's other Levi's models were omitted, and a Levi's logo sticker was added to each front fender. The version, which could be combined with the Pacer X package, did not sell in large numbers and it was dropped for the 1978 model year. Carl Green Enterprises (CGE) Pacers: these cars, modified by automobile designer Carl Green, had AMC V8 engines plus flares, air dams, and wings. The CGE Pacers appeared in Hot Rod, Popular Hot Rodding, and Car & Driver magazines. Green also built two Pacer pace cars for B.F. Goodrich to use in the International Motor Sports Association circuit, and provided body kits for Amos Johnson's Team Highball racecars. Revised two-tone paint scheme introduced in 1977 Pacers without the optional vinyl roof trim could be finished in several unique two-tone paint combinations, with front and rear scuff molding extensions on the body sides. The two-tone treatment was changed in 1977 to an \\"up and over the roof\\" accent paint scheme for the remainder of production. For 1979‚Äì1980 a hood ornament and center chrome hood strip were added. Moving toward more luxury features, power door locks became available in 1978, and in 1979 power windows joined the options list. Show cars 1976 AMC Pacer Stinger show car Pacer Stinger For the 1976 auto show circuit, AMC developed a customized Pacer Stinger. The exterior featured a matte black painted lower body panels and yellow pearl paint that faded to a pale yellow on the roof. The back half of the car had over-the-roof matte black \\"bumble bee stripes\\" that continued on the tailgate. The Stinger was fitted with oversize radial tires mounted on Jackman Star (brand) aluminum racing road wheels, a side-mounted exhaust, NACA duct on the hood, auxiliary Cibi√© (brand) driving lights, as well as a front spoiler and wheel well fender extensions. The Stinger's interior was in black with a floor-mounted shifter and front bucket seats with center console. Black and yellow stripes on the front and rear seats completed the \\"bumble bee\\" theme, while the black door panels had yellow side cushions. AM Van The 1977 AM Van is a custom van in three- quarter scale with Pacer lines. Designed by Richard Teague and based on an existing car platform, but without an interior and no mechanical components. Proposed features included four-wheel drive and it had a \\"turbo\\" decal on the double side-opening rear doors. Displayed as one of seven \\"Concept 80\\" auto show circuit tour, it was voted as being the most appealing, receiving 31% of the votes. It never moved past the concept stage, but \\"inadvertently foreshadowed the minivan craze that would sweep America in the mid-1980s\\" as well as the \\"small worker van\\" market segment. Crown Pacer American Motors was evaluating the Pacer as a compact personal luxury model with the Crown Pacer concept car that was first shown at the 1978 Chicago Auto Show. Finished in all white with a white interior, the Crown Pacer included numerous features such as a large inbuilt sun roof, real wire wheels, full rocker panel bright trim, as well as color-matched integrated flexible front and fear fascia and bumper covers with black rubber guards and impact (nerf) strips. Electric Pacers 1978 EVA Change of Pace front battery pack Some AMC Pacers were converted to plug-in electric vehicles. Electric Vehicle Associates (EVA) of Cleveland was best known for its Change of Pace model ‚Äì a built-to-order adaptation of the Pacer that was priced at $12,360 in 1978. The company converted over 100 units. First available in the sedan version, power came from eighteen 6-volt lead‚Äìacid batteries to a series DC motor with a stock three-speed automatic transmission. The EVA Change of Pace sedan weighed and reached with a range. Regenerative braking is used in conjunction with the standard hydraulic brake system which utilizes front-wheel discs and rear drums. Vehicle tests that focused on the electrical drive system including the batteries, controller, and motor \\"found that the Pacer performance is approximately equal to the majority of the vehicles tested in the 1977 assessment.\\" Later, a wagon version had twenty VARTA batteries housed in two- packs (front and rear), with a (at 3,000 rpm) motor, and the car was complete in every detail down to a gas heater. The electric Pacer wagon was one of the more expensive cars at $14,000. The Lead Industries Association (LIA) sponsored a tour for government and industry officials that featured an EVA Pacer wagon. Consolidated Edison in New York City purchased 40 modified AMC Pacers from EVA. The United States Army also included EVA Pacers in its inventory of special-purpose electric vehicles. A video documentary about the Electric Vehicle Association's electric Pacers is titled \\"A change of Pace.\\" A fully restored wagon has had its original silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) control replaced with a modern controller and the \\"hydraulically operated hybrid vehicle recharging system\\" removed because of its lack of efficiency to use compressed air from suspension travel to power a small generator to recharge the batteries. International markets Europe French dealer's advertisement, 1975 American Motors exported the Pacer to several European nations. Jean-Charles, the AMC distributor in Paris, France, compared the rounded body of the new Pacer to the buttocks of an attractive woman in magazine advertisements. Cars exported to Europe were available in higher trim levels. Sales were not spectacular, however: as late as 1983, Belgian shoppers could still buy a brand new Pacer from stock. United Kingdom American Motors vehicles were exported to the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s and sold by Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Ltd in London with dealers in London, Yorks, Kent, and Worcester. While earlier models such as the Rambler Classic, Rebel, Ambassador, and Matador had been exported as completed factory right- hand-drive vehicles, the Pacer was only available with left-hand drive. A U.K company called C.T. Wooler, in Andover, Hampshire had been in the business for a long time converting LHD cars to RHD and entered into an agreement with AMC to convert AMC vehicles. C.T Wooler converted the Pacer to right-hand drive by leaving the majority of the steering gear on the left-hand side of the car, and running a chain-drive behind the dashboard from the steering wheel (now on the right-hand side) to the top of the steering column. The car retained its unequal-length doors, designed for LHD markets, meaning that in the UK the longer door was on the driver's side, leaving the passengers to use the smaller door, which \\"in the typically confined British parking spot was virtually impossible\\". The Pacer was wider than a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow and slightly longer than the then-current Ford Cortina. The British motoring press adversely reviewed the car and AMC soon stopped exporting it. Mexico The Pacer was produced in Mexico by Veh√≠culos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) starting in 1976. The cars were marketed as a premium-priced luxury car. The VAM versions came with different engines, interiors, and other components because vehicles made in Mexico had to have at least 60% locally sourced parts. The engine was an AMC design, but modified and built by VAM. A unique to Mexico I6 engine was standard. It was designed to cope with low octane fuel and high altitudes. This engine featured dished pistons with a bore and stroke, as well as a unique head and exhaust porting design. The V8 engine, four-speed transmission, three-speed transmission with overdrive, and the wagon body style were not available in Mexico. 1976 The initial VAM Pacers were the equivalents to the U.S. AMC Pacer DL models except for a noticeably longer list of standard equipment and included some features of the U.S. Limited models of 1979 and 1980. The VAM Pacer had had no model or trim level, and U.S. derivatives such as the Pacer X, the base model, and the Levis Pacer were not available. The VAM Pacer's standard engine was the gross I6 with 7.7:1 compression ratio, 266-degree camshaft and a Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor coupled to a steel intake manifold, and featured a T-150 three- speed manual transmission with heavy-duty clutch and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. All VAM Pacers came with heavy-duty suspension (front sway bar with stiff springs and shock absorbers), power brakes with front disks, power steering (rack and pinion unit), larger radiator with coolant recovery tank, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, and electronic ignition. Standard convenience features included a custom luxury steering wheel, column-mounted manual shifter, woodgrain dashboard trim, inside hood release, individual reclining front seats with adjustable headrests, center folding armrest, fixed two-point seatbelts, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers integrated to the wiper arms, 140 km/h speedometer, courtesy lights, monaural AM radio with a single in-dash speaker, electric analog clock, heater with windshield defroster, lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, tinted windshield, plastic door panels with cloth insert and pull strap, dual rear ashtrays, folding down rear bench seat, trunk carpet, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner (U.S. base model type), and round dome light. The external appearance and equipment of the VAM Pacer consisted of a full bright molding package (wheel lips, top edges of the hood and fenders, window surrounds, rocker panels), bright rear panel between the taillights and the rear license plate housing, protective side moldings, front and rear bumper guards, bumper nerfing strips, five-mile- per-hour bumpers with recovering shocks (only VAM car with this characteristic along with the Matador-based Classic line), five-spoke in-house VAM wheels, trim rings and full cover volcano center caps on the wheels, ER78x14 radial tires, driver's side manual remote mirror, radio antenna on the passenger's side fender, squared VAM logo emblems on the fenders, Pacer emblems on the fenders and bright rear panel and a two-step hood latch. The concept of the VAM Pacer was entirely different compared to the AMC Pacer. The car was focused to be a high-end luxury car from its introduction to its end, while American Motors counterpart started as an economy car and import fighter. This was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission joined the standard equipment list, which by default created the addition of an \\"Autom√°tico\\" emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled to its level of luxury and price range practically made the car a flagship for the company, even though it was never officially considered as such. Probably the most unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer lies in its seat designs. VAM created a design based on AMC's Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974‚Äì1975 Matador coupe that used not just in the Pacer but in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer's seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer had a very short list of factory optional equipment. These included rear wiper and washer, rear defroster, reading dome light, trunk cover, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, luxury wheel covers, and heavy-duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible fan and fan shroud). A universal air conditioning system was available only as a dealership option among a few others not present in the factory list. 1977 The 1977 VAM Pacer was almost the same as in the previous year on the outside but even more luxurious on the inside. The largest difference between both models was in the seat designs. The Cassini pattern was replaced with more discreet luxury design with a \\"zigzag\\" placement of plain soft buttons on the upholstery forming diagonal lines. The AM monaural radio was replaced by an AM/FM monaural unit, three-point retractable seatbelts took the place of the hip-only units, the glovebox obtained its respective light free of extra charge. Mechanically, the engine obtained substantial engineering upgrades in the form of an all-new head design with an improved cooling system and Quench-type combustion chambers, a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio, and a new two-barrel aluminum intake manifold while the rear differential gear ratio changed from 3.31:1 to 3.07:1. This upgrade gave the VAM Pacer an estimated 12 net horsepower increase over the previous year, meaning improved fuel economy and an improved top speed without losing torque and towing capacity. The year of 1977 was the first in which a VAM car could be ordered with a factory air conditioning system, the Pacer being no exception. Units equipped with the A/C obtained the complete set of five dashboard air vents and also included a 55-amp alternator, a flexible seven-bladed cooling fan, a three-line radiator, and a fan shroud. The previously optional luxury wheel covers were moved onto the standard equipment list. 1978 The 1978 model year VAM Pacers gained new hood and grille designs, which in Mexico were just a facelift due to the lack of a V8 engine. The only technical difference of the year was the replacement of the Holley 2300 carburetor in favor of a Motorcraft 2150 unit with a built-in altitude compensator despite having a slightly lower flow. This took away a small amount of power but allowed easier passing of emission certification and was more reliable in changing altitudes. New standard features included a hood light, a speedometer in both kilometers and miles per hour, door panels including a vertical stripe pattern over their top edges, a different AM/FM radio model, a new flat-faced luxury steering wheel design with an AMC logo, and new seat designs. The heater was improved in the form of air vents appearing to the left of the instrument cluster, the center of the dashboard above the ashtray and over the top right corner of the glovebox door regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. The heater controls were revised, obtaining the VENT option in airflow selection, which was now a sliding lever instead of the five buttons used in the prior two years. The two remaining air vents, the passenger's side one over the top left corner of the glove box door and driver's side one integrated to the cover under the steering column, could only be obtained with the A/C system. 1979 The 1979 VAM Pacer was exactly as the 1978 model in terms of appearance, with the exceptions of the previously standard wheel covers and a new hood bright molding with front ornament. All VAM Pacers featured VAM's inhouse five-spoke wheels with trim rings and chrome volcano hubcaps with exposed lug nuts. New seat designs with a horizontally striped pattern and Barcelona crests on the headrests as a luxury touch (the same ones used in the AMC Matador Barcelona models), a new steering wheel design with a soft rectangular center button, all-new door panels designs in plastic and vinyl with a rigid top pull strap and sliding locks with woodgrain accents. The headliner was changed to a cloth-wrapped unit. VAM started using for the first time the net rating system for measuring the output of its engines. This meant that the 1979 VAM I6 engine was now rated at at 3900 rpm. The electrical system was revised with a new fuse box located under the dashboard on the driver's side firewall. A total of 369 VAM Pacers were sold. VAM Pacer X  VAM Pacer X  Rear VAM Pacer X A new model was introduced in 1979, the VAM Pacer X, with a serious high-performance focus. It featured a high-output version of the engine with a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio, semi-ported head, centrifugal advance-modified electronic distributor for higher acceleration, a set of headers with two final outlets divided between the first three and second three cylinders (even though a final single exhaust was used through a Y-shaped portion) and the return of the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. The output for this engine, code-named \\"4.6 SX\\" is estimated at net at 4000 revolutions per minute. This engine made the Pacer X the second-best performing VAM car of 1979, surpassing by a single tenth of a second the four-speed American Rally AMX (Concord AMX equivalent) with the standard 282 in VAM's own acceleration tests. The Pacer X was available in only three colors (black, white, and wine red), carried body- colored bumpers and had most bright items deleted, was applied with unique thin golden stripes surrounding the door and side glass areas extending through the roof from side to side, using VAM's eight-spoke sports steel wheels painted in gold with blacked-out volcano hubcaps, rear and side glass moldings were also blacked out and the lower front corners of the doors had \\"Pacer X\\" decals in place. In the interior, the Pacer X held its own design of reclining bucket seats, had a center console with a locking compartment and ashtray instead of the armrest, a set of Rallye gauges (water temperature, clock, ammeter and oil pressure) instead of the in-dashboard ashtray, a 6000 rpm tachometer in place of the electric clock, three-arm spoked sports steering wheel with a cylindrical horn button with a VAM logo, floor-mounted three-speed automatic transmission, remote-controlled driver's side door mirror, and reading dome light. Air conditioning was standard in this model and most units included a tinted glass pop-up sunroof. The rest of the equipment was the same as the standard model: power brakes, power steering, front sway bar, stiff shock absorbers and springs, 3.07:1 rear axle ratio, heavy-duty cooling system, AM FM monaural radio, tinted windshield, light group, inside hood release, and three-point retractable seatbelts. The VAM Pacer X was a limited edition model of only 250 units and is the most collectible Pacer model in Mexico. This makes a total of 619 VAM Pacers produced for 1979. Unlike the AMC Pacer, 1979 was the last year of the line for Mexico. Motorsports A 1976 Pacer was driven by Gordon Olsen and Bob Stone in the 1979 SCORE Baja 1000 Pro Class race and finished Class 6 (production cars) in second place, behind a Ford Ranchero truck. With a high rate of dropouts, \\"anyone that officially finishes a Baja race is a winner.\\" Although many questioned \\"What's a nice odd econo-car like you doing in an off-road race?\\", the car was doing very well with Olsen swapping the lead with the V8 powered truck. However, an impact resulted in the destruction of the Pacer's radiator giving the lead to the truck after 21 hours and 20 minutes of racing. Reviews A 2005 Hemmings Classic Car magazine article said that in 1975 the Pacer was \\"sleek\\" and \\"audacious\\"; \\"it looked like the car of the future\\" and \\"the automotive press loved it.\\" Motor Trend magazine, one of many that pictured the car on the cover, said it was \\"the most creative, most people oriented auto born in the U.S. in 15 years\\". Consumer Reports described that the Pacer \\"scored quite high in our tests. We would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants a fairly small car.\\" The report concluded that the Pacer did \\"at least as well as the Dodge Dart, the Plymouth Valiant, and the Chevrolet Nova, the U.S. compacts we like best,\\" and that \\"overall, the Pacer scored better than such domestic subcompacts like the Ford Pinto, the Chevrolet Vega, and AMC's own Gremlin.\\" Small Cars magazine noted that \\"admiration was an obvious reaction\\" at the press preview, and that \\"the knowledgeable product writers knew without being told that they were privileged to be there to see something new in automobile design.\\" Road & Track ran a cover story with design and engineering details. Michael Lamm, writing in Popular Mechanics, commented on many \\"thoughtful touches that distinguish AMC's strikingly futuristic new Pacer\\". He said the ride was \\"not choppy as in so many short-wheelbase cars\\", the rack-and-pinion steering gave \\"handling a feeling of precision ... sticking well in turns, with hard cornering generally solid and predictable\\", the \\"tight turning radius\\" made parking \\"easy\\", and the steering wheel was too big. Summing up, he said that with its \\"very modern styling, ample power and generous interior\\" the Pacer was \\"more car\\" than \\"the Mustang II or \\"GM's sporty compacts (Monza, Skyhawk/Starfire)\\", and that its performance felt \\"strong‚Äîcertainly on a par with most V8s.\\" Don Sherman wrote in the February 1975 issue of Car and Driver that it was \\"our first real urban transporter...There is, of course, the chance of monumental failure; it might be another Tucker ahead of its time or a pariah like the Marlin. But...with its high priority on comfortable and efficient travel and absence of Mach 2 styling, [it] at least seems right for the current state of duress. Consider this bold offering from AMC a test: Are we buying cars for transportation yet, or are they still social props?\\" The April 1975, Road & Track road test described the Pacer's appearance as \\"bold, clean and unique...even when it's going 60 mph it looks as if it's standing still...\\" but noted that, even with the test car's optional front disc brakes, \\"in the usual panic-stop tests...our driver had one of his most anxious moments ever as the Pacer screeched, skidded and demanded expert attention at the steering wheel to keep from going altogether out of control. The histrionics are reflected in long stopping distances from highway speeds... [The car's] engineering‚Äîold-fashioned and unimaginative in the extreme‚Äîdoes not match the perky design\\", which the magazine declared \\"most attractive to look at and pleasant to sit in.\\" 1975 Pacer X In a follow-up road test in August 1976, Motor Trend wrote: \\"Since its introduction in January 1975, we have been quite smitten with AMC's Pacer.\\" The magazine criticized the performance and the absence of a 4-speed transmission. A 2-barrel carburetor was offered on the larger six at the end of 1975, as well as a 4-speed manual, but the testers noted that although \\"the 2-bbl Pacer was faster than the 1-bbl car by a fair margin, it did not 'feel' faster\\" (author's emphasis). They commended the car's comfort: \\"Even with its compact exterior dimensions, the Pacer is one of the most comfortable 4-passenger cars around...The wide bucket seats were firm, but very comfortable...Front passenger leg room is extraordinary even with the seat racked well forward, and the rear seat leg room exceeds such full-sizers as the Buick Riviera and Continental Mark IV.\\" The British press was critical, and the cover of The Motor, a weekly automobile magazine, stated: \\"We test the Pacer ‚Äì and wish we hadn't.\\" Popular Mechanics described the newly added 1977 Station Wagon body style as a \\"Styling Coup\\", and said: \\"who needs the coupe!\\" By 1978 the luster had worn off the design, and as more sophisticated competitors were introduced the press began criticizing the lack of power and performance. Collectibility Collector of classic car publication Hemmings Motor News noted that small cars have always played a role in the U.S. automotive history, and that \\"among those produced during the late Seventies, the AMC Pacer was an economical giant, in a manner of speaking.\\" Now old enough to be a \\"classic car\\", the Pacer has come to be regarded in some quarters as a 1970s design icon. According to Business Week, the 1970s were \\"infamous for disco, Watergate and some of the ugliest cars ever.\\" Most cars in the U.S. from the early 1970s are noted more for their power than their styling, but they even lost their power by late 1970. Many automobiles began to lose their character and looked the same across brands and automakers, as well as focusing on \\"luxury\\" features such as vinyl roofs and non-functional opera windows. The \\"roly-poly\\" Pacer was one of the few of that era that had \\"real personalities\\" and it embodies a sense of \\"artful desperation\\" making it \\"stand out from the crowd and epitomize at once the best and worst of the seventies.\\" Nevertheless, in spite of their bad reputations, cars of the 1970s era such as the Pacer are becoming collectors' items. Business Week magazine reported that the rising values of so-called \\"nerd cars\\"‚Äîugly 1970s-era cars‚Äîprompted the CEO of a major collector-car insurance company to buy a Pacer which has \\"inexplicably appreciated substantially beyond the $2,300 that he paid for it in 2004.\\" In 2002 he said: \\"In what can sometimes be a sea of automotive sameness, the AMC Pacer continues to turn heads even today\\". A survey with 4,000 respondents chose the Ford Edsel, Pacer, Chevrolet Corvair, Nash Metropolitan, and the Volkswagen Beetle as models with poor ratings, but they are now sought after by collectors. The Pacer has been described as one of the formerly unloved cars from the 1970s that are enjoying a resurgence in both collectibility and auto restoration‚Äîespecially among fans of cars from that era. The Pacer is one of several 1970s cars that were always thought of as cheap vehicles; therefore they were poorly maintained, which reduced their life expectancy. Also the heavy engines used in the car put more load on the front suspension than intended, which caused the rack and pinion steering to fail on Pacers built in 1975. Although \\"more people collect Ford Mustangs than AMC Pacers, this does not make the Mustang more collectable than a Pacer\\" depending on the individual collector's likes, prices, and availability. Today the Pacer's originality, as well as its deficiencies, are appreciated, if not loved, by car hobbyists and serious collectors alike. Although \\"automotive oddity\\" is a recognition that the Pacer gets for its contribution to history, some owners appreciate them and have also upgraded them with the modern AMC 4.0 Jeep engine as a \\"low-buck, dare to be different\\" automobile. A few owners have further modified Pacers into drag cars. An owner that registered their car for movie work earned more that their initial purchase from its use two movies: Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and The Human Stain. Opinions about the car's collectability have changed as both the wagon and sedan versions have appreciated in value as well as the Pacer's unusualness has now become an advantage. Ownership support The classic vehicle publication Hemmings Motor News lists AMC clubs with over 50 national and regional AMC automobile clubs . Pacers share the drivetrain as well as other parts and components with other AMC models, while new old stock (NOS), used, and reproduction parts are available from vendors specializing in AMC vehicles. In popular culture Wayne's World Pacer A 1976 AMC Pacer Hatchback was used in the 1992 movie Wayne's World, and again in the 1993 movie Wayne's World 2. The Pacer used in both movies was painted bright blue with flame decals, with stock steel wheels and wheel covers in the front, and aftermarket chrome-plated steel wheels in the rear. It features a two-tone light blue-and-beige vinyl interior, as well as a licorice dispenser mounted in place of the overhead light in the headliner. Although the car appears throughout both movies, it is seen the most in the introductory scene of the first Wayne's World movie. Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) inserts a cassette tape into the stereo of the Pacer, and Wayne, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), and his friends enthusiastically enjoy listening to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" by Queen. Modifications to the movie car included interior camera mounts, tow hooks welded to the front subframe, and the removal of the climate control system. The rear wheel wells were modified to accommodate aftermarket speaker boxes, the aforementioned licorice dispenser was added, and an additional cup holder was added to the Pacer's dashboard. The car used an AMC six-cylinder engine and an automatic transmission. After sitting unused for over 20 years, the car was restored to the same specifications as in the movie. The body of the Pacer was stripped and repainted, the wheels were re-chromed, and the interior was re-covered, all to match the specifications of the screen car. A modern aftermarket head unit and speakers replaced the stereo equipment; these and the licorice dispenser are the only aftermarket parts installed on the car. OEM factory parts used to restore the car were all obtained NOS. The car was sold for $37,000 at the 2016 Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction in Las Vegas, Nevada. In the 2011 animated feature film Cars 2, Acer, Tubbs Pacer, Petey Pacer, and Fred Pacer are based on a 1975 AMC Pacer. In the 1995 animated film A Goofy Movie, Goofy's much-abused car is a thinly veiled, cartoonish version of a 1978 AMC Pacer station wagon. A 1977 Pacer D/L wagon was featured in the 1977 hit movie Oh, God! which stars John Denver and George Burns in the title role. John Denver's character Jerry drives the car in several scenes, including one in which God makes rainfall only inside the car. In the 1997 movie Good Burger a 1976 AMC Pacer was used for The Burger Mobile. The car was modified with a burger hood on the front of the car and on the back of the car added a crinkle-cut fry on the bumper. On the windshield, the wipers are replaced with crinkle-cut fries for the windshield wipers. On top of the car added a Good Burger Sign in the form of a tray of nachos and a drink on the back of the sign. Red Arrows were also put on both sides of the car. Pickle slices were also added on the wheel covers. In 2019 the car was sold to Mike Johnson owner of the Hi-Pointe Drive-In in St. Louis on April 8, 2019.

Background and education Born in London, Goulburn was the eldest son of Munbee Goulburn, of London, by his wife Susannah, eldest daughter of William Chetwynd, 4th Viscount Chetwynd. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. Goulburn lived in Betchworth, Dorking in Betchworth House for much of his life. Sugar plantation owner Goulburn's inheritance included a number of sugar estates in Jamaica, Amity Hall in the parish of Vere, now Clarendon Parish being the most important. Slave labour was still being used to work the sugar plantations when he inherited the estates. Goulburn never visited Jamaica himself due to his health and political work; he relied on attorneys to manage his estates on his behalf. One attorney, in particular, Thomas Samson, held the top job at the estate from 1802‚Äì1818 and earned a reputation for cruelty towards Goulburn's slaves. By 1818. the income from his Jamaican estates halved to less than ¬£3,000, \\"although he did console himself that the condition of his slaves had probably In 1818, Henry Goulburn‚Äôs brother was sent to inspect the Jamaican Sugar Plantation. Thomas Samson had already been dismissed over his treatment of slaves. Henry Goulburn wrote to Samson in June of 1818, ‚ÄúSince my brother‚Äôs return to England, I have had a great deal of conversation with him respecting the management of my Estate in Jamaica, the state of the Negroes and other particulars connected with it which from want of personal inspection of the property I have hitherto but imperfectly understood. The result had been a conviction upon my mind that as far as regards the negroes of the Estate, the system hitherto used by you had been founded altogether upon erroneous principles which (though I believe to be too commonly followed on the generality of estates in Jamaica) are such as I can never approve because I cannot consider them consistent with the duty which I owe to the negroes which belong to me... You have recently been possessed of a considerable property which makes the management of my Estate less if at all an object to you ... therefore your removal from Amity Hall cannot inconvenience you in a pecuniary point of view.‚Äù Political career In 1808, Goulburn became Member of Parliament for Horsham. In 1810, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs, and two and a half years later, he was made Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. It was in this capacity that James Meehan named Goulburn, New South Wales after him, a naming that was ratified by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Still retaining office in the Tory government, he became a Privy Counsellor in 1821, and shortly afterwards was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, a position which he held until April 1827. Here, although he was frequently denounced as he was considered an Orangeman, he had a successful period of office on the whole, and in 1823 he managed to pass the Composition for Tithes (Ireland) Act 1823. In January 1828, he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer under the Duke of Wellington; like his leader, he disliked Roman Catholic emancipation, which he voted against in 1828. In the finance domain, Goulburn's chief achievements were to reduce the interest rate on the part of the national debt and allow anyone to sell beer upon payment of a small annual fee, a complete change of policy about the drink traffic. Leaving office with Wellington in November 1830, Goulburn was Home Secretary under Sir Robert Peel for four months in 1835. When this statesman returned to office in September 1841, he became Chancellor of the Exchequer for the second time. Although Peel himself did some of the chancellor's work, Goulburn was responsible for a further reduction in the rate of interest on the national debt, and he aided his chief in the struggle, which ended in the repeal of the Corn Laws. With his colleagues, he left office in June 1846. After representing Horsham in the House of Commons for over four years, Goulburn was successively member for St Germans, for West Looe, and for the city of Armagh. In May 1831, he was elected for Cambridge University, and he retained this seat until his death. According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, Goulburn was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a ¬£15 million loan (worth ¬£ in ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015).

Neighboring districts were (from north-east clockwise) Chemnitzer Land, Stollberg, Aue-Schwarzenberg, Vogtlandkreis, and the districts Greiz and Altenburger Land in Thuringia. The district-free city of Zwickau was located in the center of the district and nearly completely surrounded by it.  History  In early days Zwickau was the starting point for the settlement of a whole region. The first official document of the ‚Äùterritorim zwickaw‚Äù dates from May 1, 1118. The settlement by German farmers took mainly place in the second half of the 12th century. At the same time castles were built. A special area was administered by a bailiff, as a representative of the governor. The Wettiners were the most powerful rulers in Saxony in the 13th century. In the region of Zwickau the sovereign of Sch√∂nburg and Wildenfels were given the rule over their comparatively small territories. With the division of the Saxon country the administrative structures became unclear in Leipzig in 1485. The borderline between albertinian and ernestinian possession was tangent to the Zwickauer city boundary. With the development of the Saxon state uniformed administrative structures began gradually to develop. In the Middle Ages the Saxon area was divided into governor‚Äôs residence, apart from the central administration. Out of this new jobs developed in the 15th century. The ‚Äúadministrators‚Äù (Amtsmann) practised the jurisdiction, and were responsible for the military quantity and public security. The administrators came from the rural aristocracy. The noble administrator was promoted to the ‚Äúchief administrator‚Äù (Amtshauptmann) during the following century, who usually supervised two to four offices. At the same time the ‚ÄúKursaxon‚Äù territory was divided into districts for a better administration. The district was headed by a ‚Äúcounty administrator‚Äù (Kreishauptmann or Oberhauptmann). During the whole Middle Ages and afterwards ‚Äì even until our century - the city Zwickau with their surrounding area was regarded as a unit, concerning administrative matters. Ongoing conflicts, for example the Thirty Years' War and the Seven Years' War, influenced the administration negatively. Zwickau was the seat of the chief administrator. Since 1828, additionally the county administrators ruled from there the Southwest and the middle ‚ÄúErzgebirge‚Äù and the suburbs. Only in 1835, became the regional administration a new structure. The county administrators were replaced by ‚Äúdistrict directions‚Äù (Kreisdirektion) in Dresden, Leipzig, Bautzen and Zwickau. The chief administrators in Zwickau, Chemnitz, Wolkenstein, Plauen and in the territory of the sovereign of Sch√∂nburg belonged to the district direction Zwickau. The following offices were headed by the chief administrator in Zwickau: Kirchberg, Werdau, Schwarzenberg, Eibenstock and of course Zwickau. Hartenstein, Lichtenstein, Stein, Waldenburg and Glauchau were controlled by the sovereign of Sch√∂nburg. In 1856 an important step toward modern administration was done with the establishment of new administration offices, the ‚Äúoffices of court‚Äù (Gerichtsamt). Thereby the old office organization could be overcome. In 1873 justice and administration were separated. Now the offices of court were only responsible for the law. The ‚Äúadministration crews‚Äù (Amtshauptmannschaft) were responsible for the administration. There were four ‚Äúcounty administration crews‚Äù (Kreishauptmannschaften), which were created as organs of the Saxon government. The county administration crew of Zwickau consisted of the administration crews in Annaberg, Auerbach, Chemnitz, Fl√∂ha, Marienberg, Oelsnitz, Plauen, Schwarzenberg and Zwickau. In 1919 a branch office of Zwickau was opened in Werdau. It became an independent office in 1920, but in 1933 it was affiliated to Zwickau again. The rural constitution of 1946 as well as the Saxon constitution of 1947 established democratic values in Saxony again, like they had existed before the beginning of the Third Reich. Now part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the federal state of Saxony was liquidated as part of the administration reforms implemented from July 23, 1952. At the same time the former district Zwickau was divided into the districts Werdau and Zwickau. The area of the district Zwickau received a strong reduction. A considerable part turned into the district Werdau; furthermore, parts of the Zwickauer area were added to the district of Reichenbach. On the other hand the \\"M√ºlsengrund\\" was extracted from the district Glauchau and was affiliated to the district Zwickau. With the dramatic events in autumn 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. The German Democratic Republic ceased to exist as Germany was re-united. With Saxon parliamentary elections on October 14, 1990, the federal state of Saxony was re-established. On May 6, 1990 local elections took place. At the constituent meeting of district assembly Christian Otto was elected head of the administration of the district Zwickau. In the district Werdau the citizens elected Georg Hamburg to head of the administration. With the district reform on August 1, 1994, the rural district ‚ÄúZwickauer Land‚Äù was created, seated in Werdau. With the termination of the municipality regional reorganization on January 1, 1999, the district changed its geographical face again. The places Cainsdorf, Mosel, Oberrothenbach and Schlunzig were affiliated to Zwickau against the will of the people living there. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Zwickauer Land, Chemnitzer Land and the urban district Zwickau were merged into the new district Zwickau.  Geography  The district is located in the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge), with the main river s being the Zwickauer Mulde and the Plei√üe.

Fuzzy-Felt is a simple fabric toy intended for young children, first sold in 1950. The toys consist of a flocked backing board onto which a number of felt shapes are placed to create different pictures. Felt pieces can be simple silhouettes or more detailed printed shapes. For a farmyard scene, for example, auxiliary pieces would typically be cows, sheep, chickens, horses, cats, dogs, a farmer, and a tractor. Other scenes might include hospital, pets, vehicles. Fuzzy-Felt is for children over the age of three years, as the pieces may present a choking hazard. History Fuzzy-Felt was invented by Lois Allan (d. Farnham Common 1989) during World War II, although similar products had exisited pre-war, for example Kiddicraft K100 'Pictures in Felt' of 1937. Born Lois Day, she was an American.Kathy Martin, Famous Brand Names and Their Origins (Barnsley: Pen & Sword History, 2016), p. 137; . She studied art and fashion in Paris in the 1920s.Susan Brewer, Collecting Classic Girls' Toys (Barnsley: Remember When, 2010), p. 257 . She married a Scotsman and Great War RAF Captain, Peter Allan, and moved to Vine Cottage in Farnham Common in Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom, where the couple ran a travel agency and other entrepreneurial pursuits including printing cruise ships on cigarette cases. During the Second World War, Peter‚Äôs son, Lois‚Äôs step-son, Anthony Murray Allan, also known as Jock or Peter, was captured by the Germans, escaping from a prison camp as part of the Laufen 6, but was recaptured and sent to Colditz, where he daringly escaped inside a mattress, only to be recaptured in Austria. During the Second World War, Peter and Lois Allan contributed to the war effort by manufacturing felt gaskets for sealing components in tanks in the outbuildings of her home. Other women were involved in this work, and the Allan‚Äôs ran a creche for their children. She was inspired to create the toy after observing how much enjoyment children had taking the discarded and misshaped pieces of felt and sticking them to the backs of table mats. Product development following the end of the War took a few years, but after gaining the interest of toy buyers at John Lewis and Heals, Allan was able to bring Fuzzy-Felt to market in 1950, later founding Allan Industries Ltd. Production continued at Allan's home, Vine Cottage, until 1972, when the business relocated to larger premises in the Cressex Estate in High Wycombe. In 1996 the business was bought by Mandolyn Ltd in a management buy-out, and production continued in High Wycombe until increasing manufacturing costs led to the licensing of the Fuzzy-Felt brand to a much larger UK toy manufacturer and wholesalers, Toy Brokers Ltd of Huntingdon. In 2001, via his holding company, Mr Douglas Ware a Buckinghamshire based businessman acquired a controlling interest in Mandolyn Ltd. This holding company became 100% owner of Mandolyn Ltd and Fuzzy-Felt Ltd in 2012. In 2011, Toy Brokers Ltd had in turn been bought by John Adams Leisure Ltd who then became the licensee of the Fuzzy-Felt brand for Toy products. As of 2016, an estimated 26.25 million sets of Fuzzy-felt had been sold internationally. Although Fuzzy-Felt reached its peak in popularity sometime in the mid-1970s, it remains an iconic children's toy, still enjoyed by children who play with it and parents who nostalgically purchase it. Popularity Fuzzy-Felt composition of a farmyard scene by a thirty-nine- year-old. Many reasons have been attributed to Fuzzy-Felt‚Äôs popularity. Though seemingly simple, the various available themed sets allow for hours of creativity. Though the sets started out strictly as a collection of various coloured shapes, countless themes Fuzzy-Felt sets became available through the years. ‚ÄúBallet, Farmyard, Circus, Hospital, and much later on Thomas the Tank Engine, Noddy, and My Little Pony were released to inspire [a child‚Äôs] picture-making‚Äù abilities. Fuzzy-Felt was also a favoured toy in Sunday schools because of its ‚ÄúBible Stories set, complete with camels and three kings.‚Äù The quiet toy was, and still is, fairly cheap, can be played almost anywhere leaving little mess, save a few stray pieces of shaped felt behind, making it a popular choice among parents. In popular culture Fashion In 2008, fashion designer Stella McCartney used a ‚Äú 7-meter high, 14-meter wide‚Äù Fuzzy-Felt backdrop, created by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, as a visual accent for the debut of her 2008 spring/summer collection in Paris. The backdrop was made up of ‚Äúrainbow-coloured rabbits, giraffes and a particularly anxious ladybird‚Äù, all reminiscent of the 1970s child‚Äôs toy. Literature In Jeanette Winterson's novel Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, the protagonist Jeanette uses Fuzzy-Felt to depict Bible scenes, one of which is a rewrite of Daniel in the lions' den. She depicts Daniel as getting eaten by the lions, and when confronted by the pastor tries to disguise this by saying that she 'wanted to do Jonah and the whale, but they don't do whales in Fuzzy-Felt'. The pastor then tells Jeanette that they should do the Astonishment at Dawn scene, and Jeanette remarks to herself that this is 'hopeless... Susan Green was sick on the tableau of the three Wise Men at Christmas, and you only get three kings to box'. Music Fuzzy-Felt Folk is a collection of ‚Äúrare, delightful folk oddities for strange adults and maybe their children too‚Ä¶ The front cover imagery of the album is from the original 1968 Fuzzy-Felt Fantasy set.‚Äù Current Fuzzy-Felt toy products are currently sold by John Adams Leisure Ltd of Huntingdon, under license from Fuzzy-Felt Ltd and Mandolyn Ltd. There is a UK registered trade mark (number 2461883) for \\"Fuzzy-Felt\\", registered to a non-trading UK company (number 03227732) \\"Fuzzy-Felt Ltd\\". In 2017 Fuzzy-Felt was commemorated with a special stamp from the Royal Mail, which was celebrating 10 of the most iconic and much-loved British toys from the last 100 years. Fuzzy-Felt was amongst the top ten classic toys chosen. Even after nearly 70 years, Fuzzy-Felt continues to evoke feelings of nostalgia across generations and is still hugely popular throughout the world today.

Its central theme charged car manufacturers of resistance to the introduction of safety features (such as seat belts), and their general reluctance to spend money on improving safety. This pioneering work contains substantial references and material from industry insiders. It was a best seller in non-fiction in 1966. Theme Unsafe at Any Speed is primarily known for its critique of the Chevrolet Corvair, although only one of the book's eight chapters covers the Corvair. It also deals with the use of tires and tire pressure being based on comfort rather than on safety, and the automobile industry disregarding technically-based criticism. A 1972 N.H.T.S.A. report disputed his allegations about abnormal handling in sharp turns and suggested the Corvair's rollover rate was comparable to similar cars. Organization and content Each of the book's chapters covers a different aspect of automotive safety:  \\"The Sporty Corvair\\"  1961-63 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension The subject for which the book is probably most widely known, the rear-engined Chevrolet Corvair, is covered in Chapter 1‚Äî\\"The Sporty Corvair-The One-Car Accident\\". This relates to the first models (1960‚Äì1964) that had a swing-axle suspension design which was prone to \\"tuck under\\" in certain circumstances. To make up for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar), Corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers' recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15psi front, 26psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was a dangerous oversteer. Despite proper tire pressures being more critical than for contemporaneous designs, Chevrolet salespeople and Corvair owners were not properly advised of the requirement and risk. According to the standards of the Tire and Rim Association, these recommended pressures caused the front tires to be overloaded, when there were two or more passengers in the car. An unadvertised at-cost option (#696) included upgraded springs and dampers, front anti-roll bars and rear-axle-rebound straps to prevent tuck- under. Aftermarket kits were also available, such as the EMPI Camber Compensator, for the knowledgeable owner. The suspension was modified for 1964 models, with inclusion of a standard front anti-roll bar and a transverse- mounted rear spring. In 1965, the totally redesigned four-link, fully independent rear suspension maintained a constant camber angle at the wheels. A redesign for the 1965 model eliminated the tuck-under crash tendency. George Caramagna, a mechanic working on the suspension system, suggested installing the anti-sway bar, but was overruled by management. A 1972 safety commission report conducted by Texas A&M; University concluded that the 1960‚Äì1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year. NHTSA had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars‚Äîa Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, and Renault Dauphine‚Äîalong with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling. NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that \\"the 1960‚Äì63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests [...] the handling and stability performance of the 1960‚Äì63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic.\\"  \\"Disaster deferred\\"  Brilliant chrome-finishing at the dashboard and A pillar of a 1957 Buick Roadmaster Chapter 2 levels criticism on auto design elements such as instrument panels and dashboards that were often brightly finished with chrome and glossy enamels which could reflect sunlight or the headlights of oncoming motor vehicles into the driver's eyes. This problem, according to Nader, was well known to persons in the industry, but little was done to correct it. Ralph Nader in 1975 Nader also offered advice about the gear shift quadrants on earlier cars fitted with automatic transmissions. Several examples are given of people being run over, or runaway-cars because drivers were not familiar with the shift pattern, causing them to shift into reverse when intending to shift to park. Nader made an appeal to the auto industry to standardize gearshift patterns as a safety issue. Early automatic transmissions, including GM's Hydra-Matic, Packard's Ultramatic, and Borg Warner's automatic used by a number of independent manufacturers (Rambler, Studebaker) used a pattern of \\"P N D L R\\", which put Reverse at the bottom of the quadrant, next to Low which was contrary to the pattern used by other manufacturers. Drivers used to moving the shift lever all the way down for \\"low gear\\" would accidentally select \\"R\\" and would unexpectedly move the car backwards. In addition, other manufacturers, such as Chrysler, used a push- button selector to choose gear ranges. Ford was the first to use the \\"P R N D L\\" pattern, which separated Reverse from forward ranges by Neutral. Eventually this pattern became the standard for all automatic-shift cars. Chevrolet's Powerglide, as used on the Corvair, used a \\"R N D L\\" pattern, which separated the Reverse from the Drive gears by neutral in the ideal way, but which had no \\"P\\" selection, only providing a parking brake. Chapter 2 also exposes problems in workmanship and the failure of companies to honor warranties. \\"The second collision\\" Chapter 3 documents the history of crash science focusing on the effect on the human body (the second collision) as it collides with the interior of the car as the car hits another object (the first collision). Nader says that much knowledge was available to designers by the early 1960s but it was largely ignored within the American automotive industry. There are in-depth discussions about the steering assembly, instrument panel, windshield, passenger restraint, and the passenger compartment (which included everything from door strength to roll-over bars). Due to this, the \\"Nader bolt\\" was installed to reinforce the door and suicide doors were discontinued because of a lack of door strength. \\"The power to pollute\\" Chapter 4 documents the automobile's impact on air pollution and its contribution to smog, with a particular focus on Los Angeles. \\"The engineers\\" Chapter 5 is about Detroit automotive engineers' general unwillingness to focus on road- safety improvements for fear of alienating the buyer or making cars too expensive. Nader counters by pointing out that, at the time, annual (and unnecessary) styling changes added, on average, about $700 to the consumer cost of a new car (). This compared to an average expenditure in safety by the automotive companies of about twenty-three cents per car ().Unsafe at Any Speed Grossman Publishers, New York (1965) Unsafe at Any Speed demonstrated that aggressive styling like that of the 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air was hazardous to pedestrians. \\"The stylists\\" Chapter 6 explores the excessive ornamentation that appeared on cars, particularly in the late 1950s, and the dominance of car design over good engineering. Of the 1950s designs, Nader notes \\"bumpers shaped like sled-runners and sloping grille work above the bumpers, which give the effect of 'leaning into the wind', increase ... the car's potential for exerting down-and-under pressures on the pedestrian.\\" See current practice at Pedestrian safety through vehicle design. \\"The traffic safety establishment\\" Subtitled \\"Damn the driver and spare the car,\\" Chapter 7 discusses the way the blame for vehicular crashes and harm was placed on the driver. The book says that the road safety mantra called the \\"Three E's\\" (\\"Engineering, Enforcement and Education\\") was created by the industry in the 1920s to distract attention from the real problems of vehicle safety, such as the fact that some were sold with tires that could not bear the weight of a fully loaded vehicle. To the industry, he said \\"Enforcement\\" and \\"Education\\" meant the driver, while \\"Engineering\\" was all about the road. As late as 1965, he noted that 320 million federal dollars were allocated to highway beautification, while just $500,000 was dedicated to highway safety. \\"The coming struggle for safety\\" Chapter 8, the concluding chapter, suggests that the automotive industry should be forced by government to pay greater attention to safety in the face of mounting evidence about preventable death and injury.  Reception  Unsafe at Any Speed was a bestseller in nonfiction from April through July 1966.Hawes Publishing historical listings of New York Times bestseller lists It also prompted the passage of seat-belt laws in 49 states (all but New Hampshire) and a number of other road-safety initiatives. Government response U.S Senate hearings prompted by the book led to the creation of the United States Department of Transportation and the predecessor agencies of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1966.G.M. & Ralph Nader Jack Doyle, PopHistoryDig.com, March 31, 2013 retrieved Feb 11, 2018 The book has continuing relevance: it addressed what Nader perceived as the political lobbying of the car industry to oppose new safety features, which was later seen in the 1990s with mandatory airbags in the United States, and industry efforts by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) to delay the introduction of crash tests in the European Union. Industry response In response to Nader's criticisms, GM attempted to sabotage Nader's reputation. It \\"(1) conducted a series of interviews with acquaintances of the plaintiff, 'questioning them about, and casting aspersions upon [his] political, social, racial and religious views; his integrity; his sexual proclivities and inclinations; and his personal habits'; (2) kept him under surveillance in public places for an unreasonable length of time; (3) caused him to be accosted by girls for the purpose of entrapping him into illicit relationships; (4) made threatening, harassing and obnoxious telephone calls to him; (5) tapped his telephone and eavesdropped, by means of mechanical and electronic equipment, on his private conversations with others; and (6) conducted a 'continuing' and harassing investigation of him.\\"Nader v. General Motors Corp. Court of Appeals of New York, 1970 On March 22, 1966, GM President James Roche was forced to appear before a United States Senate subcommittee and apologized to Nader for the company's campaign of harassment and intimidation. Nader sued GM in November 1966 for invasion of privacy. He won the case on appeal in January 1970 and was awarded $425,000, which he used to establish the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit advocacy group. He went on to lobby for consumer rights, helping drive the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the Clean Air Act, among others.An Unreasonable Man, 2006 documentary film Former GM executive and Chevrolet's general manager John DeLorean asserted in his book On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors (1979) that Nader's criticisms were valid. Criticisms of the book The U.S. Department of Transportation issued a press release dated August 12, 1972, setting out the findings of 1971 NHTSA testing‚Äîafter the Corvair had been out of production for more than three years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars, a Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, Volkswagen Beetle, Renault Dauphine‚Äîalong with a second generation Corvair with revised suspension design. The subsequent 143-page report (PB 211-015, available from NTIS) reviewed a series of actual handling tests designed to evaluate the handling and stability under extreme conditions; a review of national accident data compiled by insurance companies and traffic authorities for the cars in the test‚Äîand a review of related General Motors/Chevrolet internal letters, memos, tests, reports, etc. regarding the Corvair's handling. NHTSA went on to contract a three-person advisory panel of independent professional engineers to review the scope and competency of their tests. This review panel then issued its own 24-page report (PB 211-014, available from NTIS), which concluded that \\"the 1960‚Äì63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests...the handling and stability performance of the 1960‚Äì63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic.\\" Economist Thomas Sowell contended that Nader was dismissive of the trade-off between safety and affordability. According to Sowell, Nader also did not mention that motor vehicle death rates per 100 million passenger miles fell over the years from 17.9 in 1925 to 5.5 in 1965.Thomas Sowell: Vision of the Anointed. Basic Books, 1995, pp 70 et seq. Journalist David E. Davis, in a 2009 article in Automobile Magazine, criticized Nader for purportedly focusing on the Corvair while ignoring other contemporary vehicles with swing-axle rear suspensions, including cars from Porsche, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, notwithstanding the fact that Nader's Center for Auto Safety had published a book critical of the Beetle, Small - On Safety: The designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen. In 2005, the book received an honorable mention by conservative publication Human Events for its \\"Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries\\", meaning two or more out of fifteen conservative thinkers voted for it. Other award winners included authors Betty Friedan and John Maynard Keynes.

Bodysuits can be made from a number of fabrics, including cotton, lace, nylon, etc. In general, textile bodysuits include expandable fiber such as spandex for a better fit to the shape of the body. A bodysuit is normally worn with trousers or a skirt. The top, torso part may act as a top for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or skirt. They may also be worn generally by women as underwear, activewear, or foundation garments. Unlike a leotard, a bodysuit is not usually considered a form of athletic wear. Onesies (or snapsuits) are bodysuits for younger children, toddlers, and some adults that help keep diapers in place. The purpose of the opening at the crotch is to facilitate access to a baby's diaper or for a visit to the toilet. There are also bodyshirts, like the counterpart to the bodysuit, they are loose- fitting garments that cover the whole torso, with sleeves in short to long lengths and crotch snaps. The difference is that they look like a shirt on the top portion of the garment, and may have a different stretch fabric in the waist to the crotch area to make them fit better. History The bodysuit was a progression from the leotard. It was presented in the United States after 1950 by fashion designer Claire McCardell. It was worn as a blouse or T-shirt. The first recognized bodysuit was worn by Bettie Page in the 1950s, and was a trademark attire of the Playboy Bunnies from the 1960s, as well as of Wonder Woman in the animated series Super Friends as well as Lynda Carter's television series. Azzedine Alaia and Donna Karan helped make the bodysuit a fashion item for both men and women in the 1980s. After a slowdown, it was resurrected as shaping underwear or lingerie, and in the 2010s it reappeared as a blouse bodysuit and classic turtleneck bodysuit, as well as a part of evening wear.

He also was the father-in-law of former professional American football fullback Fui Vakapuna. Early life, education, and military service Faleomavaega was born in Vailoatai Village, American Samoa and grew up in Oahu, Hawaii. He graduated from Kahuku High School and initially attended Church College of Hawaii (now Brigham Young University‚ÄìHawaii), where he completed his associate's degree. He then transferred to Brigham Young University's main campus in Utah and earned a B.A. in political science and history in 1966. He received his J.D. from the University of Houston Law Center in 1972 and LL.M. from the UC Berkeley School of Law in 1973. He served as an enlistee in the United States Army from 1966 to 1969, and as an officer in the United States Army Reserve from 1982 to 1989.

He and his wife were active members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Legal career Faleomavaega served as the administrative assistant to American Samoa Delegate A.U. Fuimaono from 1973 to 1975 and as staff counsel for the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1975 to 1981. He served as the Deputy Attorney General of American Samoa from 1981 to 1984. Political career Faleomavaega entered elective politics when he ran alongside A. P. Lutali in the 1985 gubernatorial race. He served as Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa from 1985 to 1989. In 1987, he participated in an event that followed traditional Polynesian life experiences by sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii in a canoe.

Faleomavaega, a superdelegate, announces the distribution of American Samoa's delegate votes as part of the roll call of the states during the third day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Faleomavaega was elected as a Democrat to the House of Representatives in 1988, serving from January 3, 1989 until January 2015. As a delegate, he has worked to receive more federal funding for his home territory, particularly for health care and other essential services. He has opposed free trade deals involving meats and seafood, as nearly one-third of his territory's population is involved in the tuna industry. He proposed legislation that would allow residents of US territories to vote in presidential elections if they are active duty members of the military. Faleomavaega also participated in a boycott of Jacques Chirac, who made a speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress in 1996, due to French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Committee assignments Faleomavaega was a member of the following committees in the House of Representatives: *Committee on Foreign Affairs **Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment (Ranking Member) **Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere *Committee on Natural Resources **Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources **Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs Caucuses *Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Support for Sri Lanka's war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Faleomavaega has said that it is more opportune if the United States could refrain from interfering in internal affairs of Sri Lanka. He took the initiative of briefing members of the Sub Committee on Asia and the Pacific of the US House of Representatives in this respect. Support for American Samoa's independence In 2012, both Faleomavaega and Togiola Tulafono, American Samoa's Governor, called for the populace to consider a move towards autonomy if not independence, to a mixed response. Support for Bahrain's monarchy Faleomavaega was known for his vocal support of Bahrain's monarchy during the Bahraini uprising. One of Faleomavaega's top campaign donors, William Nixon, is a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist whose firm, Policy Impact Communications, founded the pro-monarchy Bahrain American Council.

DSD uses pulse-density modulation encoding - a technology to store audio signals on digital storage media which are used for the SACD. The signal is stored as delta-sigma modulated digital audio, a sequence of single-bit values at a sampling rate of 2.8224 MHz (64 times the CD audio sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, but only at 1‚ÅÑ32768 of its 16-bit resolution). Noise shaping occurs by use of the 64-times oversampled signal to reduce noise and distortion caused by the inaccuracy of quantization of the audio signal to a single bit. Therefore, it is a topic of discussion whether it is possible to eliminate distortion in one-bit delta-sigma conversion. Development DSD is a method of storing a delta-sigma signal before applying a decimation process that converts the signal to a PCM signal. Delta-sigma conversion was first described by C.C. Cutler in 1954, but was not named as such until a 1962 paper by Inose et al. Decimation did not initially exist and oversampled data was sent as-is. The proposal to decimate oversampled delta-sigma data before converting it into PCM audio was made by D. J. Goodman in 1969. DSD technology was later developed and commercialized by Sony and Philips, the designers of the audio CD. However, in 2005, Philips later sold its DSD tool division to Sonic Studio. ;Major label support DVD-Audio was endorsed by the Warner Music Group, while the SACD format was endorsed by Sony and Universal Music Group, with an especially high-profile by UMG imprint Virgin Records. Despite this, in 2011, The Warner Premium Sound series of albums was released by Warner Music Group, marking the first time the label released titles in a SACD format, with recording in DSD. The series grew to ten rock and pop albums, with Super Audio CD/CD hybrid discs containing both an SACD layer and a standard CD layer. Sony did not promote SACD actively in North America, with the result that DVD-Audio gained competitive traction in the market. Elsewhere, such as in Europe or Japan, SACD gained more of a foothold. Examples include the German Stockfisch Records, which releases vinyl editions of albums and DSD-recordings, released as hybrid SACDs. ;Independent label use Many music companies that specialize in Super Audio CD products therefore use DSD encoding. A number of independent record labels have also worked directly with Sony to focus on DSD products or the DSD recording process. DMP Digital Music Products was an early user of the SACD digital audio format. In 1997 their release Alto by Joe Beck & Ali Ryerson was the first commercial recording captured with Sony's Direct Stream Digital recording technology. The label's Just Jobim by Manfredo Fest in 1998 was the first project captured with the new Meitner DSD conversion technology. In 2000, DMP released the world's first multi-channel SACD‚ÄîSacred Feast by Gaudeamus. The majority of Telarc International Corporation's releases were on (generally hybrid) SACD, and are DSD recordings. Telarc often worked with early audiophile company Soundstream, and re-released many of its original Soundstream recordings in SACD format. Soundstream, which made the first digital recording in the United States, recorded in 16 bit PCM at a sample rate of 50 kHz via its own proprietary digital recorder. This 50 kHz PCM format was converted to DSD for release on Telarc SACD. The record label Mobile Fidelity had engineers who decided to adopt the Super Audio CD over the DVD-Audio disc as a high resolution digital format after listening tests and technical evaluations. On the label's Hybrid SACD releases, the SACD layer is a direct DSD recording of the analog master tape, while the CD layer is a digital down conversion of the DSD, with Super Bit Mapping applied. Post-2001, CD-only are sourced from DSD, but omit the SACD layer. In 2007, Blue Coast Records was founded in California for the purpose of recording and releasing music recorded with the DSD format, primarily focusing on jazz and acoustic artists. On August 28, 2013, the Acoustic Sounds label launched SuperHiRez.com, which sells mainstream albums from major record labels that were produced with Direct Stream Digital or PCM audio formats. On September 4, 2013, Acoustic Sounds announced an agreement with Sony Music Entertainment to provide the company's new digital download service with albums that have been produced or remastered in Direct Stream Digital format. The format is used on albums such as Pop, Songs & Death in 2009, and the remastered The Rolling Stones album Their Satanic Majesties Request in 2002. DSD technique Comparison with PCM SACD audio is stored in DSD, which differs from the conventional PCM used by the compact disc or conventional computer audio systems. A DSD recorder uses delta-sigma modulation. DSD is 1-bit with a 2.8224 MHz sampling rate. The output from a DSD recorder is a bitstream. The long-term average of this signal is proportional to the original signal. DSD uses noise shaping techniques to push quantization noise up to inaudible ultrasonic frequencies. In principle, the retention of the bitstream in DSD lets the SACD player use a basic (one-bit) DAC design with a low-order analog filter. The SACD format can deliver a dynamic range of 120 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and an extended frequency response up to 100 kHz‚Äîthough most current players list an upper limit of 80‚Äì90 kHz. Most professional audiologists accept that the upper limit of human adult hearing is 20 kHz and that high frequencies are the first to be affected by hearing loss. The process of creating a DSD signal is conceptually similar to taking a one-bit delta-sigma analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and removing the decimator, which converts the 1-bit bitstream into multi-bit PCM. Instead, the 1-bit signal is recorded directly and, in theory, only requires a lowpass filter to reconstruct the original analog waveform. In reality it is a little more complex, and the analogy is incomplete in that 1-bit sigma-delta converters are these days rather unusual, one reason being that a one-bit signal cannot be dithered properly: most modern sigma-delta converters are multi-bit. Because of the nature of sigma-delta converters, one cannot make a direct comparison between DSD and PCM. An approximation is possible, though, and would place DSD in some aspects comparable to a PCM format that has a bit depth of 24 bits and a sampling frequency of 88200 Hz. Because it has been extremely difficult to carry out DSP operations (for example performing EQ, balance, panning and other changes in the digital domain) in a one-bit environment, and because of the prevalence of solely PCM studio equipment such as Pro Tools, the vast majority of SACDs‚Äîespecially rock and contemporary music, which rely on multitrack techniques‚Äîare in fact mixed in PCM (or mixed analog and recorded on PCM recorders) and then converted to DSD for SACD mastering. To address some of these issues, a new studio format has been developed, usually referred to as DSD-wide, which retains the high sample rate of standard DSD, but uses an 8-bit, rather than single-bit digital word length, yet still relies heavily on the noise shaping principle. DSD-wide is PCM with noise shaping‚Äîand is sometimes disparagingly referred to as \\"PCM- narrow\\"‚Äîbut has the added benefit of making DSP operations in the studio a great deal more practical. The main difference is that \\"DSD-wide\\" still retains 2.8224 MHz (64Fs) sampling frequency while the highest frequency in which PCM is being edited is 384 kHz (8Fs). The \\"DSD-wide\\" signal is down- converted to regular DSD for SACD mastering. As a result of this technique and other developments there are now a few digital audio workstations (DAWs) that operate, or can operate, in the DSD domain, notably Pyramix and some SADiE systems. Another format for DSD editing is Digital eXtreme Definition (DXD), a PCM format with 24-bit resolution sampled at 352.8 kHz (or alternatively 384 kHz). DXD was initially developed for the Merging Pyramix workstation and introduced together with their Sphynx 2, AD/DA converter in 2004. This combination meant that it was possible to record and edit directly in DXD, and that the sample only converts to DSD once before publishing to SACD. This offers an advantage to the user as the noise created by converting DSD raises dramatically above 20 kHz, and more noise is added each time a signal is converted back to DSD during editing. Note that high-resolution PCM (DVD- Audio, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc) and DSD (SACD) may still technically differ at high frequencies. A reconstruction filter is typically used in PCM decoding systems, much the same way that bandwidth-limiting filters are normally used in PCM encoding systems. Any error or unwanted artifact introduced by such filters typically affects the end-result. A claimed advantage of DSD is that product designers commonly choose to have no filtering, or modest filtering. Instead DSD leads to constant high levels of noise at these frequencies. The dynamic range of DSD decreases quickly at frequencies over 20 kHz due to the use of strong noise shaping techniques that push the noise out of the audio band, resulting in a rising noise floor just above 20 kHz. The dynamic range of PCM, on the other hand, is the same at all frequencies. However, almost all present-day DAC chips employ some kind of sigma-delta conversion of PCM files that results in the same noise spectrum as DSD signals. All SACD players employ an optional low-pass filter set at 50 kHz for compatibility and safety reasons, suitable for situations where amplifiers or loudspeakers cannot deliver an undistorted output if noise above 50 kHz is present in the signal. Double-rate DSD (DSD128) Referred to as DSD128 because the sample rate is 128 times that of CD. Since its establishment content creators have started to make 5.6 MHz DSD128 recordings available, such as the audiophile label Opus3. Additionally a 44.1 kHz variant at 5.6448 MHz has been supported by multiple hardware devices such as the exaSound e20 Mk II DAC. The Korg MR-1000 1-bit digital recorder samples at 5.6448 MHz, twice the SACD rate. Quad- rate DSD (DSD256) Referred to as DSD256 because the sample rate is 256 times that of CD. The Pyramix Virtual Studio Digital Audio Workstation allows for recording, editing and mastering all DSD formats, being DSD64 (SACD resolution), DSD128 (Double-DSD) and DSD256 (Quad-DSD). A 44.1 kHz variant of 12.288 MHz has been established. The exaSound e20 DAC was the first commercially available device capable of DSD256 playback at sampling rates of 11.2896/12.288 MHz. The Merging Technologies Horus AD/DA Converter offers sample rates up to 11.2 MHz, or four times the SACD rate. Octuple-rate DSD (DSD512) Referred to as DSD512 because the sample rate is 512 times that of CD. It has a sample rate of 22.5792 MHz (512 times that of CD), or alternatively 24.576 MHz (512 times 48 kHz). Hardware such as the Amanero Combo384 DSD output adapter, and exaU2I USB to I¬≤S interface, and software such as JRiver Media Center, foobar2000 with SACD plugin (up to DSD256 only), Roon, HQPlayer and Neutron Music Player are all able to handle DSD files of this advanced sampling rate fully natively. DSD playback options Sony developed DSD for SACD, and many disk players support SACD. Since the format is digital, there are other ways to play back a DSD stream; the development of these alternatives has enabled companies to offer high-quality music downloads in DSD. DSD disc format Some professional audio recorders (from Korg, Tascam, and others) can record in DSD format. Transferring this signal to a recordable DVD with the appropriate tools, such as the AudioGate software bundled with Korg MR-1/2/1000/2000 recorders, renders a DSD Disc. Such discs can be played back in native DSD only on certain Sony VAIO laptops and PlayStation 3 systems. HQPlayer from February 16, 2011, version 2.6.0 beta includes support for direct/native playback from DSD Interchange File Format (DSDIFF) and DSD stream files (DSF) to ASIO devices with DSD support. Moreover, Sony produces two SACD players, the SCD-XA5400ES and the SCD-XE800, that fully support the DSD-disc format. Only the DSF format is supported. DSF is a stereo-only, simplified form of DFF, the format used for SACD mastering and 5.1-channel downloads. However, since most personal computers have only PCM audio hardware, DSD discs must be transcoded to PCM on the fly with the proper software plug-ins with questionable quality benefits compared to native high resolution PCM sources like DVD or Blu-ray Disc Audio. In June 2012, Pioneer launched a series of SACD players compatible with DSD-disc. The PD-30 and PD-50. In January 2013, TEAC announced a DSD-disc compatible player, the PD-501HR. DSD over USB An alternative to burning DSD files onto disks for eventual playback is to transfer the (non-encrypted) files from a computer to audio hardware over a digital link such as USB. The USB audio 2.0 specification defined several formats for the more common PCM approach to digital audio, but did not define a format for DSD. In 2012, representatives from many companies and others developed a standard to represent and detect DSD audio within PCM frames; the standard, commonly known as \\"DSD over PCM\\", or \\"DoP\\", is suitable for other digital links that use PCM. The 1.1 revision added protocol support for higher DSD sample rates without requiring an increase the underlying PCM sample rate. Many manufacturers now offer DACs that support DoP. DSD vs. PCM There has been much controversy between proponents of DSD and PCM over which encoding system is superior. In 2001, Lipshitz and Vanderkooy stated that one-bit converters, as employed by DSD, are unsuitable for high-end applications due to their high distortion.Audio Engineering Society Convention Paper 5395. In 2002, Philips published a paper arguing the contrary.Convention Paper 5616. Lipshitz and Vanderkooy's paper was further criticized by Angus.Audio Engineering Society presentation in Convention Paper 5619. Lipshitz and Vanderkooy later responded to the criticisms.Convention Paper 5620. Stuart also defined sigma delta modulation a \\"totally unsuitable choice\\" for high resolution digital audio. Conventional implementation of DSD has an intrinsic high distortion. Distortion can be alleviated to some degree by using multibit digital to analogue converter. Historically, state-of-the-art ADCs were based around sigma-delta modulation designs. Oversampling converters are frequently used in linear PCM formats, where the ADC output is subject to bandlimiting and dithering.(Hawksford 1995). Many modern converters use oversampling and a multi-bit design. Comparisons of DSD and PCM recordings with the same origin, number of channels and similar bandwidth and noise have yielded contradictory results. A study conducted at the Erich-Thienhaus Institute in Detmold, Germany found that in double-blind tests \\"hardly any of the subjects could make a reproducible distinction between the two encoding systems.\\" In contrast, a 2014 study conducted at the Tokyo University of the Arts found that listeners could distinguish PCM (192 kHz/24 bits) from either DSD (2.8 MHz) or DSD (5.6 MHz) (but not between the two DSD samplings), preferring the sound of DSD over PCM: \\"For example, Drums stimulus of DSD (5.6 MHz) has p = 0.001 when compared against PCM (192 kHz/24 bit) in overall preference. This suggests that DSD version was statistically significantly preferred over the PCM version.\\"Marui, A., Kamekawa, T., Endo, K. and Sato, E., 2014, April. Subjective evaluation of high resolution recordings in PCM and DSD audio formats. In Audio Engineering Society Convention 136. Audio Engineering Society. DSD met with relatively little success in the consumer market, even though the SACD was actually more successful than its direct competitor, the PCM-based DVD-Audio. Direct manipulation of recorded DSD data is difficult due to limited availability of appropriate software. The advent of new high-resolution PCM standards, such as DXD, further restricted its market niche. DSD, however, is still used as an archival format for studio applications, and it's seen as a possible replacement for analog tapes.

Life Armstrong was born in Milan, Erie County, Ohio. He attended the Huron Institute in Milan and Western Reserve College in Cleveland, Ohio, then moved to the Minnesota Territory in 1856. He was elected surveyor of Mower County, and was assigned to survey federal lands. When Minnesota was admitted to the Union, Armstrong moved to Yankton, Dakota Territory, then a small Native American village. He was a member of the first Territorial House of Representatives in 1861, was reelected in 1862 and 1863, and served as speaker in 1863. He became editor of the Dakota Union newspaper in 1864, and was appointed clerk of the territorial Supreme Court in 1865. He was elected to the territorial council in 1866 and in 1867, and served as the council's president. In 1867, Armstrong acted as secretary of the Indian peace commission in Dakota Territory. Continuing as a surveyor, he established the great meridian and standard lines for United States surveys in southern Dakota and in the northern Red River Valley. He was again elected to the Territorial council in 1869.

Str√•hle's 1743 article \\"Nytt P√•fund, at finna Temperaturen i st√§mningen\\" Str√§hle's construction is a geometric method for determining the lengths for a series of vibrating strings with uniform diameters and tensions to sound pitches in a specific rational tempered musical tuning. It was first published in the 1743 Proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences by Swedish master organ maker Daniel Str√•hle (1700‚Äì1746). The Academy's secretary Jacob Faggot appended a miscalculated set of pitches to the article, and these figures were reproduced by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg in Versuch √ºber die musikalische Temperatur in 1776. Several German textbooks published about 1800 reported that the mistake was first identified by Christlieb Benedikt Funk in 1779, but the construction itself appears to have received little notice until the middle of the twentieth century when tuning theorist J. Murray Barbour presented it as a good method for approximating equal temperament and similar exponentials of small roots, and generalized its underlying mathematical principles. It has become known as a device for building fretted musical instruments through articles by mathematicians Ian Stewart and Isaac Jacob Schoenberg, and is praised by them as a unique and remarkably elegant solution developed by an unschooled craftsman. The name \\"Str√§hle\\" used in recent English language works appears to be due to a transcription error in Marpurg's text, where the old-fashioned diacritic raised \\"e\\" was substituted for the raised ring.Wilhelm Friedrich Marpurg Versuch √ºber die musikalische Temperatur 1776 p.167-168  Background  Daniel P. Str√•hle was active as an organ builder in central Sweden in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. He had worked as a journeyman for the important Stockholm organ builder Johan Niclas Cahman, and in 1741, four years after Cahman's death, Str√•hle was granted his privilege for organ making. According to the system in force in Sweden at the time a privilege, a granted monopoly which was held by only a few of the most established makers of each type of musical instruments, gave him the legal right to build and repair organs, as well as to train and examine workers, and it also served as a guarantee of the quality of the work and education of the maker.Eva Helenius-√ñberg \\"Svensk Instrumentmakeri 1720-1800 - En Prelimin√§r √ñversikt\\" Svensk Tidskrift f√∂r Musikforskning, 1977 p.22 An organ by him from 1743 is preserved in its original condition at the chapel at Str√∂msholm Palace; History: Str√∂msholm Palace The Royal Palaces - The Royal Court (accessed October 14, 2009) he is also known to have made clavichords, and a notable example with an unusual string scale and construction signed by him and dated 1738 is owned by the Stockholm Music Museum.Edward L.

Snyder The Organ as a Mirror of its Time: North European Reflections, 1600-2000 Oxford University Press, 2002 p.8, 15) with Swedish Academy of Science founding member Christopher Polhem.Tobias Norlind Svensk Musikhistoria Helsingborgs Typografiska Anstalt, Helsingborg 1901. p. 132 He died in 1746 at L√∂vstabruk in northern Uppland. Str√•hle published his construction as a \\"new invention, to determine the Temperament in tuning, for the pitches of the clavichord and similar instruments\\" in an article that appeared in the fourth volume of the proceedings of the newly formed Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which included articles by prominent scholars and Academy members Polhem, Carl Linnaeus, Carl Fredrik Mennander, Augustin Ehrensv√§rd, and Samuel Klingenstierna. According to organologist Eva Helenius musical tuning was a subject of intense debate in the Academy during the 1740s,Eva Helenius-√ñberg \\"Cembalon i Sverige samt Fr√•gan om det Svenska Klavikordets Uppkomst\\" Svensk Tidskrift f√∂r Musikforskning 1979 p.31-42 and though Str√•hle himself was not a member his was the third article on practical musical topics published by the Academy‚Äîthe first two were by amateur musical instrument maker, minister, and Academy member Nils Brelin\\"Nils Brelin\\" Nordisk Familjebok fj√§rde bandet Nordisk Familjeboks f√∂rlags aktiebolag Stockholm 1905 p.86 which related inventions applicable to harpsichords and clavichords.Nils Brelin \\"Et P√•fund at Storligen √∂ka Claviers och Cymbalers godhet\\" Kongliga Swenska Wetenskaps Academiens Handlingar, f√∂r M√•naderne Julius, August och September 1739 vol. 1, p.81; Nils Brelin \\"Beskrifning √∂fver det nyt P√•fund af en upr√§t-st√•ende dubbel Clavesin, inr√§ttad met forte och Piano til 8. graders f√∂r√§ndring, som wid 1741. √•rs Riksdag f√∂r Riksens H√∂glofl. St√§nder blifwit upwist, af des inventor Nicol. Brelin Kongliga Swenska Wetenskaps Academiens Handlingar, f√∂r M√•naderne Julius, August och September vol.3 p.218 Str√•hle wrote in his article that he had developed the method with \\"some thought and a great number of attempts\\" for the purpose of creating a gauge for the lengths of the strings in the temperament which he described as that which made the tempering (\\"sv√§fningar\\") mildest for the ear, as well comprising as the most useful and even arrangement of the pitches. His instructions produce an irregular tuning with a range of tempered intervals similar to better known tunings published during the same period, but he provided no further comments or description about the tuning itself; today it is generally considered to be an approximation of equal temperament.Barbour (1951) p.65 He also did not elaborate upon any advantages of his construction, which can produce accurate and repeatable results without calculations or measurement with only a straightedge and dividers; he described the construction in only five steps, and it is less iterative than arithmetic methods described by Dom B√©dos de Celles method for determining organ pipe lengths in just intonation or Vincenzo Galilei for determining string fret positions in approximate equal temperament, and geometrical methods such as those described by Gioseffo Zarlino and Marin Mersenne‚Äîall of which are much better known than Str√•hle's. Str√•hle concluded by stating that he had applied the system to a clavichord, although the tuning as well as the method of determining a set of sounding lengths can be used for many other musical instruments, but there is little evidence showing whether it was put into more widespread practice other than the two examples described in the article, and whose whereabouts today are unknown.  Construction  rightStr√•hle instructed first to draw a line segment QR of a convenient length divided in twelve equal parts, with points labeled I through XIII. QR is then used as the base of an isosceles triangle with sides OQ and OR twice as long as QR, and rays drawn from vertex O through each of the numbered points on the base. Finally a line is drawn from vertex R at an angle through a point P on the opposite leg of the triangle seven units from Q to a point M, located at twice the distance from R as P. The length of MR gives the length of the lowest sounding pitch, and the length of MP the highest of the string lengths generated by the construction, and the sounding lengths between them are determined by the distances from M to the intersections of MR with lines O I through O XII, at points labeled 1 through 12. Str√•hle wrote that he had named the line PR \\"Linea Musica\\", which Helenius noted was a term Polhem had used in an undated but earlier manuscript now located at the Link√∂ping Stifts- och Landsbibliotek and which is accompanied by notes from composer and geometer Harald Vallerius (1646‚Äì1716) and Str√•hle's former employer J. N. Cahman. Str√•hle also showed line segments parallel to MR through points NHS, LYT, and KZV in order to illustrate how once created the construction could be scaled to accommodate different starting pitches. Str√•hle stated at the conclusion of the article that he had implemented the string scale in the highest three octaves of a clavichord, although it is unclear whether this section would have been strung all with the same gauge wire under equal tension like the monochord which he wrote it resembled, and whose construction he described in more detail. He only described an indirect method of setting its tuning, however, requiring that he first establish reference pitches by transferring the corresponding string lengths to the movable bridges on a keyed thirteen string monochord whose open strings had been previously tuned in unison.  Faggot's numerical representation  right The article following Str√•hle's was a mathematical treatment of it by Jacob Faggot (1699‚Äì1777), then secretary of the Academy of Sciences and future director of the Surveying Office, who in the same volume also contributed articles on a weight measure for lye and methods for calculating the volume of barrels. Faggot was one of the first members of the Academy, and had also been member of a special commission on weights and measures.\\"Jakob Faggot\\" Nordisk Familjebok Band 7, Nordisk familjeboks f√∂rlags aktiebolag, Stockholm 1907 p.1259 He apparently was not a musician, though Helenius described he was interested in musical topics from a mathematical perspective and documented that he periodically came in contact with musical instrument makers through the Academy.Eva Helenius-√ñberg \\"Kyrkoherden Nils Brelin‚ÄîMechanicus och Klaver√§lskare\\" Svensk Tidskrift f√∂r Musikforskning 1987 p.112 Helenius also presented a theory that Faggot had a more active, if indirect and posthumous influence on the construction of musical instruments in Sweden, claiming that he may have suggested the long tenor strings used in two experimental instruments built by Johan Broman in 1756 which she proposed influenced the type of clavichord built in Sweden in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.The instruments‚Äîa harpsichord and clavichord, both in the Stockholm Music Museum collection‚Äîare notable for their extreme large size and long tenor strings, where string length doubling extends down five octaves, and three octaves and a fourth respectively.

Georg Christian Grund, Hamburg; Adam Heinrich Holle, Leipzig 1751 p. 226-229, 230-234 and a table of Faggot's calculated string lengths was subsequently included by Marpurg on his 1776 Versuch √ºber die musikalische Temperatur, who wrote that he accepted their accuracy but that rather than accomplishing \\"Str√§hle\\"'s stated goal, the tuning represented an unequal temperament \\"not even of the tolerable type.\\" The sounding lengths calculated by Faggot are substantially different from what would be produced according to Str√•hle's instructions, a fact which appears to have been first published by Christlieb Benedict Funk in Dissertatio de Sono et Tono in 1779,reviewed in \\"Leipzig\\" G√∂ttingische Anzeigen von gelehrten Sachen unter der Aufsicht der K√∂nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften. 32 St√ºck (11 M√§rz, 1780) Erste Band. Johann Christian Dieterich, G√∂ttingen, 1780 The article reported that the actual tuning was nothing new since it did not differ significantly from the usual division of the octave. and the tuning he created includes intervals tuned outside of the range conventionally used in Western art music. Funk is credited the observation of this discrepancy in Gehler's Physikalisches W√∂rterbuch in 1791,Dissertatio de Sono et Tono. Leipzig. 1779. 4; cited by Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler \\"Ton\\" Physikalisches W√∂rterbuch oder Versuch einer Erkl√§rung der vornehmsten Begriffe und Kunstw√∂rter der Naturlehre Vierter Theil.

Heinrich Dieterich, G√∂ttingen 1804 p.26 and the error was pointed out by Ernst Chladni in Die Akustik in 1830.Ernest Florens Friedrich Chladni Die Akustik Breitkopf & H√§rtel, Leipzig 1830 p.39 No similar comments appear to have been published in Sweden during the same period. These works report Faggot's mistake as the result of having used a value from the tangent instead of the sine column from the logarithmic tables. The error itself consisted of making the angle of RP about seven degrees too great, which caused the effective length of QP to increase to 8.605. This greatly exaggerated the errors of the temperament compared to the tunings he presented alongside of it, although it is not clear whether Faggot observed these apparent defects as he made no further comments about Str√•hle's construction or temperament in the article. right  The tuning  The tuning produced following Str√•hle's instructions is a rational temperament with a range of fifths from 696 to 704 cents, which is from about one cent flatter than a meantone fifth to two cents sharp of just 3:2; the range of major thirds is from 396 cents to 404 cents, or ten cents sharp of just 5/4 to three cents flat of Pythagorean 81/64. These intervals fall within what is considered to have been acceptable but there is no distribution of better thirds to more frequently used keys that characterize what are today the most popular of the tunings published in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which are known as well temperaments. The best fifth is pure in the key of F‚ôØ‚Äîor the pitch given by MB‚Äîwhich has a 398 cent third, and the best third is in the key E, which has a 697 cent fifth; the best combination of the two intervals is in the key of F and the worst combination is in the key of B‚ô≠.  Barbour's algebraic representation and geometric construction J. Murray Barbour brought new attention to Str√•hle's construction along with Faggot's treatment of it in the 20th century. Introduced in the context of Marpurg, he included an overview of it alongside the more famous methods of determining string lengths in his 1951 book Tuning and Temperament where he characterized the tuning as an \\"approximation for equal temperament\\". He also demonstrated how close Str√•hle's construction was to the best approximation the method could provide, which reduces the maximum errors in major thirds and fifths by about half a cent and is accomplished by substituting 7.028 for the length of QP. Barbour presented a more complete analysis of the construction in \\"A Geometrical Approximation to the Roots of Numbers\\" published six years later in American Mathematical Monthly.J. Murray Barbour \\"A Geometrical approximation to the Roots of Numbers\\" American Mathematical Monthly vol. 64 (1957) p.1-9 He reviewed Faggot's error and its consequences, and then derived Str√•hle's construction algebraically using similar triangles. This takes the generalized form N^m \\\\doteq \\\\frac{OA + BA + (OA - 3BA) \\\\times{m}}{OA +BA - 2BA\\\\times{m}} Using the values from Str√•hle's instructions this becomes \\\\frac{24 + 10m}{24 - 7m} Letting \\\\scriptstyle OA-BA=1 so that \\\\scriptstyle OA+BA=\\\\sqrt{N} leads to a form of the first formula that is more useful for calculation N^m \\\\doteq \\\\frac{Nm+\\\\sqrt{N}(1-m)}{m+\\\\sqrt{N}(1-m)} Barbour then described a generalized construction using the easily obtained mean proportional for the length of MB that avoids most of the specific angles and lengths required in the original. For musical applications it is simpler and its results are slightly more uniform than Str√•hle's, and it has the advantage of producing the desired string lengths without additional scaling. He instructed to first draw the line MR corresponding to the larger of the two numbers with MP the smaller, and to construct their mean proportional at MB. The line that will carry the divisions is drawn from R at any acute angle to MR, and perpendicular to it a line is drawn through B, which intersects the line to be divided at A, and RA is extended to Q such that RA=AQ. A line is drawn from Q through P, intersecting the line through BA at O, and a line drawn from O to R. The construction is completed by dividing QR and drawing rays from O through each of the divisions. Barbour concluded with a discussion of the pattern and magnitude of the errors produced by the generalized construction when used to approximate exponentials of different roots, stating that his method \\"is simple and works exceedingly well for small numbers\\". For roots from 1 to 2 the error is less than 0.13%‚Äîabout 2 cents when N=2‚Äî with maxima around m=0.21 and m=0.79. The error curve appears roughly sinusoidal and for this range of N can be approximated by about 99% by fitting the curve obtained for N=1, f(m)=m(1-m)(1-2m). The error increases rapidly for larger roots, for which Barbour considered the method inappropriate; the error curve resembles the form \\\\scriptstyle f(x)=x(1-x^{2a}) with maxima moving closer to m= 0 and m=1 as N increases. Schoenberg's refinements of Barbour's methods The paper was published with two notes added by its referee, Isaac Jacob Schoenberg. He observed that the formula derived by Barbour was a fractional linear transformation and so called for a perspectivity, and that since three pairs of corresponding points on the two lines uniquely determined a projective correspondence Barbour's condition that OA be perpendicular to QR was irrelevant. The omission of this step allows a more convenient selection of length for QR, and reduces the number of operations. Schoenberg also noted that Barbour's equation could be viewed as an interpolation of the exponential curve through the three points m=0, m=1/2 and m=1, which he expanded upon in a short paper titled \\"On the Location of the Frets on the Guitar\\" published in American Mathematical Monthly in 1976.Isaac J. Schoenberg \\"On the Location of the Frets on a Guitar\\" American Mathematical Monthly vol. 83, 1976 p.550-2. This article concluded with a brief discussion of Str√•hle's fortuitous use of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac {41}{29} for the half-octave, which is one of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of the \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{2}, and the best rational approximation of it for the size of the denominator. Stewart and continued fractions The use of fractional approximations of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{2} in Str√•hle's construction was expanded upon by Ian Stewart, who wrote about the construction in \\"A Well Tempered Calculator\\" in his 1992 book Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into... Ian Stewart Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into... Courier Dover Publications, 2004 p.246-252 as well as \\"Faggot's Fretful Fiasco\\" included in Music and Mathematics published in 2006. Stewart considered the construction from the standpoint of projective geometry, and derived the same formulas as Barbour by treating it from the start as a fractional linear function, of the form \\\\scriptstyle y= \\\\frac{(ax+b)}{(cx+d)}, and he pointed out that the approximation for \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{2} implicit in the construction is \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac {17}{12}, which is the next lower convergent from the half octave it produces. This is the consequence of the function simplifying to \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{p+2q}{p+q} for m=0.5 where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{p}{q} is the generating approximation. Similar methods applied to musical instruments The geometric and arithmetic methods for dividing monochords as well as musical instrument fretboards compiled by Barbour were for the stated purpose of illustrating the different tunings each represents or implies, and Schoenberg's and Stewart's works retained similar focus and references. Three textbooks on piano building that are not included by them show similar constructions to Str√•hle's for designing new instruments but treat the tuning of their pitches independently; both constructions employ a non-perpendicular form as suggested by Schoenberg's observation in Barbour's \\"A Geometrical approximation to the Roots of Numbers\\", and one achieves optimal results while the other demonstrates an application with a root other than 2. K√ºtzing Carl K√ºtzing, an organ and piano maker in Bern during the middle of the 19th century wrote in his first book on piano design, Theoretisch-praktisches Handbuch der Fortepiano-Baukunst from 1833, that he devised a simple method of determining the sounding lengths in an octave after reading of the different geometric constructions described in an issue of Marpurg's Historisch- kritischen Beitragen zur Aufnahme der Musik; he stated that the divisions would be very accurate and that the construction could be used for fretting guitars. K√ºtzing introduced the construction following a description of a large sector to be made for the same purpose. He did not include either method in Das Wissenschaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst published eleven years later, where he calculated lengths using approximately 18:35 ratios between octave lengths and proposed a new method with a non-continuous curve adjusted for actual wire diameters in order to reduce tonal differences from jumps in tension.Carl K√ºtzing. Das Wissenschaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst. J. F. J. Dalp. Bern und Chur, 1844 K√ºtzing instructed to extend a line segment bc‚Äîrepresenting a known sounding length‚Äîat 45 degrees to the line ba, and from its octave at point d located midway between b and c, to extend a line perpendicular to ba intersecting it at e, then to divide de into 12 equal parts. The point a on ab is located by transferring the lengths of de, db, from e away from b, and rays extended from a through the points dividing de and intersecting bc to locate the different endpoints of the string lengths from c.Carl K√ºtzing. Theoretisch-praktisches Handbuch der Fortepiano-Baukunst. J. F. J. Dalp. Bern und Chur, 1833. p.20-21 This arrangement is equivalent to using the mean proportional to locate a. A re-labeled diagram with instructions was included in a pamphlet printed by England's largest piano manufacturers John Broadwood & Sons to accompany their display at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, where they described it as \\"a practical method of finding the lengths of Strings, for every note of the Octave on equal temperament; so that with wire of the same size the tension on each note shall be the same.\\"Alastair Laurence. The Evolution of the Broadwood Grand Piano 1785-1998 \\"fig. 6/6: Broadwood's scale design geometry, 1862\\" University of York Department of Music September 1998, p.151 It was also reproduced, alongside a sector, by Giacomo Sievers, a Russian-born piano maker working in Naples, in his 1868 book Il Pianoforte, where he claimed it was the best practical method for determining sounding lengths of strings in a piano. Like Broadwood, Sievers did not describe its source or extent of its use, and did not explain any theory behind it. He also did not suggest it had any use beyond designing pianos.Giacomo Sievers, Il Diagramma per lo spartimento delle corde. Il pianoforte; Guida Pratica per Costruttori, Accordatori, Dilettanti e Possessori di Pianoforti Stabilimento Tipografico Ghio, Napoli 1868. p.103-104 Wolfenden English piano maker Samuel Wolfenden presented a construction for determining all but the lowest sounding plain string lengths in a piano in A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction published in 1916; like Sievers, he did not explain whether this was an original procedure or one in common use, commenting only that it was \\"a very practical method of determining string lengths, and in past years I used it altogether\\". He added that at the time of writing he found calculating the lengths directly \\"somewhat easier\\" and had preceded the description with a table of computed lengths for the top five octaves of a piano.Samuel Wolfenden, String Lengths and Diameters. A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction 1916, reprinted by Unwin Brothers, London, 1975 p.23-33 He included frequencies in equal temperament, but only published aural tuning instructions in his 1927 supplement. Wolfenden explicitly advocated equalizing the tension of the plain strings which he proposed to accomplish in the upper range by combining a 9:17 ratio between octave lengths with a uniform change in string diameters (achieving slightly more consistent results over the otherwise similar system published by Siegfried Hansing in 1888Siegfried Hansing The Pianoforte and its Acoustic Properties second edition, translated by Emmy Hansing-Perzina. Siegfried Hansing, Schwerin i. M., 1904 p.84), in contrast to Sievers scale whose stringing schedule results in higher tension for the thicker, lower sounding pitches. Like Sievers, Wolfenden constructed all of the sounding lengths on a single segment at 45 degrees from the base lines for the rays, starting with points located for each C in the range designed at 54, 102, 192.5, 364 and 688mm from the upper point. The four vertices for the rays are then located by the intersections of the horizontal base lines extended from the lower C in each octave with a second line angled from the upper starting point for the string line, however, which he specified should both be at 51.5 degrees to the base lines and that the base lines have a 35:13 ratio with the difference between the two octave lengths.

Bennett, Dakota Territory Congressman. Granville Gaylord Bennett (October 9, 1833 ‚Äì June 28, 1910) was an American lawyer who served as a justice of the Supreme Court for the Dakota Territory and as a delegate to the United States House of Representatives. Biography Granville was born near Bloomingburg in Fayette County, Ohio. His family moved to Fulton County, Illinois in 1849, and then to Washington, Iowa in 1855. He attended Washington College, an academy in Washington, Iowa, and then studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1859, and practiced in Washington. In 1860, he married Mary Dawson. They were the parents of three children who survived to adulthood; Estelline, who was society editor of the Chicago Record-Herald; Helen, who was editor of the Hot Springs (South Dakota) Herald; and Gaylord, who was a clergyman in Nebraska. During the American Civil War he served in the Union Army, first as an officer in the 19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and later on the staff of Thomas J. McKean, commander of the Army of the Tennessee. Following the war, he was discharged as a first lieutenant and returned to Washington, Iowa. He served as a member of the Iowa House of Representatives (1865‚Äì1867) and Iowa State Senate (1867‚Äì1871). Bennett moved to the Dakota Territory in the early 1870s. He was appointed an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Territory in 1875, and he served until 1878. In 1878, he was elected as the Territory's Delegate to the U.S. Congress, and served as a Republican from March 4, 1879 to March 3, 1881. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1880. After his term in Congress, Bennett returned to Deadwood, South Dakota, where he continued to practice law. In 1902, he was elected judge of the Lawrence County Court, and he served three terms. He died in Hot Springs, Fall River County, South Dakota. He was interred in Mount Moriah Cemetery, in Deadwood. Bennett County, South Dakota is thought by some historians to be named in his honor, whereas others attribute the county name to John E. Bennett, and some claim it honors both men.

Trumbull and Nicholas Cooke of Rhode Island were the only men to serve as governor of both a British colony and an American state, and he was the only governor to take up the Patriot cause at the start of the Revolutionary War., Trumbull College at Yale University, the town of Trumbull, Connecticut, Trumbull County, Ohio (originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve), and Jonathan the Husky are all named for him. Early life Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, the son of Joseph Trumble (1678‚Äì1755) and his wife, Hannah Trumble (n√©e Higley), the daughter of John Higley and Hannah Drake. The patriarch of the Trumble family was the immigrant John Trumble (1612‚Äì1687), from Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, who was Joseph's grandfather. The original spelling of \\"Trumble\\" was later changed for an unknown reason. Jonathan graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in 1727; three years after graduation, during which time he studied theology under the Reverend Solomon Williams at Lebanon and was licensed to preach at Colchester, Connecticut, this became a Master of Arts degree. Career Trumbull became a merchant with his father in 1731, participating more fully in the business after the death of his brother at sea in 1732. From 1733 to 1740, he was a delegate to the general assembly, and, in 1739‚Äì1740, was Speaker of the House. He was appointed lieutenant colonel in Connecticut's militia in 1739, and was colonel of the 12th Connecticut Regiment during the French and Indian War. He served as deputy governor of the Colony of Connecticut from 1766‚Äì1769, and, on the death of Governor William Pitkin, became Governor of Connecticut in 1769, serving in that capacity until 1784, through Connecticut's transition from a colony to a U.S. state. Revolutionary War On May 13, 1774, British General Thomas Gage arrived in Boston, a city with a history of violent protests against British policies. Given the problems he was inheriting from Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson, within a week of arriving Gage contacted Trumbull and expressed a \\"readiness to cooperate\\" with him \\"for the good of his Majesty's service.\\"Phelps, Page 48. When Gage sent Trumbull a request for assistance after the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, Trumbull refused and made clear his choice to side with the Patriots. He replied that Gage's troops would \\"disgrace even barbarians\\", and he accused Gage of \\"a most unprovoked attack upon the lives and the property of his Majesty's subjects.\\"Eddlem, Thomas R. 25-AUG-03 The New American http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24329109_ITM On July 6, 1775, along with other officers, Trumbull commissioned Nathan Hale as a first lieutenant in the newly raised Seventh Regiment of the Continental Army.Rose, Page 8. Hale was later executed by the British for espionage. Trumbull was a friend and advisor of General George Washington throughout the Revolutionary period, dedicating the resources of Connecticut to the fight for independence. Washington declared him \\"the first of the patriots.\\"Phelps, Page 59. When Washington was desperate for men or food during the war, he could turn to \\"Brother Jonathan\\".Lefkowitz, Page 232. Trumbull also served as the Continental Army's Paymaster General (Northern Department) in the spring of 1778, until the untimely death of his mother forced him to resign his post. As part of his resignation, he requested that the remainder of his back pay be distributed to the soldiers of the Northern Department. Post-war Trumbull was one of only two colonial governors to continue in office after independence (the other was Rhode Island's Nicholas Cooke, who assumed office early in the war). Governor Trumbull was elected as an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati in 1784. In 1782, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received an honorary LL.D. from Yale University in 1775 and from the University of Edinburgh in 1787. Personal life Faith Robinson Trumbull, depicted donating her cloak for the revolutionary war effort In 1736, one year prior to his marriage, Jonathan Trumbull Sr. purchased Flora, a 'mulato girl and slave for life', from Eliphalet Adams of New London.http://www.yaleslavery.org/WhoYaleHonors/trumbull.html On December 9, 1735, he married Faith Robinson (1718‚Äì1780), daughter of Reverend John Robinson. They were the parents of six children, including: *Joseph Trumbull (1737‚Äì1778), first commissary general of the Continental Army and an early member of the Board of War. *Jonathan Trumbull Jr. (1740‚Äì1809), aide-de-camp to General George Washington from 1781 to the end of the war, and Governor of Connecticut from 1798 to 1809. *Faith Trumbull (1743‚Äì1775), who married General Jedidiah Huntington. *Mary Trumbull (1745‚Äì1831), who married William Williams, signer of the Declaration of Independence. *David Trumbull (1751‚Äì1822), commissary of the Colony of Connecticut and father of Joseph Trumbull, the 35th Governor of Connecticut. *John Trumbull (1756‚Äì1843), \\"Painter of the American Revolution\\" and aide-de-camp to General Washington for 19 days in 1775. Trumbull died in Lebanon, Connecticut, and is buried at the Old Cemetery there. His home in Lebanon, the Jonathan Trumbull House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. In historical fiction *In A Little Maid of Old Connecticut by Alice Turner Curtis, the main character, a little girl named Ellie Barlow, aided by a friend, delivers a secret message to Trumbull during his years as governor, after which he seeks her out, and helps her friend's father get a much-needed job.

It consists of six episodes of 24-minutes each. It was written by Ken Catran and directed by Chris Bailey, with the novelisation written by Marie Stuttard. Plot synopsis On holiday at her uncle's farm in New Zealand, Gretchen befriends Ronny, a MƒÅori boy with a troubled city past, and Bevis, the birdwatching son of a loathed developer. Tension is already high as the developer wants to buy and drain a local swamp for a housing estate, but Ronny's uncle is the guardian of a traditional MƒÅori tapu (taboo/curse) upon the swamp. The swamp must not be touched--something sleeps there that must not be awakened. Something unnatural. In the story, twelve-year-old Gretchen has a passion for science and a talent for all things mechanical, which is why the strange old brass \\"weathervane\\" (referred to as the \\"daisy rod\\") on her uncle's farm fascinates her. But the brass daisy rod has a complex and terrifying significance, and Gretchen and her new friend Ronny discover its links with the far distant Sirius, the Dog Star. Gradually, the children discover the pieces of an ancient alien space probe named Kolob. During the series they assemble the missing parts and strange things start to happen. The probe was one of three sent to earth to educate the human race in science. In the end a communication link is set up with the star Sirius B, from where the probe came, and the aliens tell them they should not have interfered. Episodes * The Brass Daisy * Power Stop * Swamp Light * Alien Summons * Kolob * Alien Contact Availability For a long time, Children of the Dog Star remained unavailable due to complex copyright issues. But TVNZ released the series on DVDTVNZ on DVD (as of 3 July 2009), and syndicated the show to certain North American PBS stations. The series was also broadcast in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Poland, Greece and the United Kingdom during the mid and late 1980s. Dubbings were made in Czech and Slovak. Since 2011 the series has been available on YouTube. Influences The main idea for the plot, that of space probes sent out from Sirius to educate primitive people, is lifted from the 1976 book The Sirius Mystery by Robert K. G. Temple. The name Kolob appears to be taken from the church of the Latter Day Saints cosmology, and may mean \\"dog\\". Stephen King's The Tommyknockers, which was released three years later, has similarities to the story. Awards It won the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1984, as well as the New Zealand Feltex 1984 best drama award.Ken Catran profile on the New Zealand Book Council site Adaptations Book A novelisation, written by Marie Stuttard, was released in 1985 (). Trivia The closing credits of each episode incorrectly shows MCMLXXIV in the copyright notice which translates to 1974. The videogame Ronny and Gretchen play in the grocery store is The Pit.

History The Dakota Territory consisted of the northernmost part of the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, as well as the southernmost part of Rupert's Land, which was acquired in 1818 when the boundary was changed to the 49th parallel. The name refers to the Dakota branch of the Sioux tribes which occupied the area at the time. Most of Dakota Territory was formerly part of the Minnesota and Nebraska territories. When Minnesota became a state in 1858, the leftover area between the Missouri River and Minnesota's western boundary fell unorganized. When the Yankton Treaty was signed later that year, ceding much of what had been Sioux Indian land to the U.S. Government, early settlers formed an unofficial provisional government and unsuccessfully lobbied for United States territory status. Three years later President-elect Abraham Lincoln's cousin-in-law J.B.S. Todd personally lobbied for territory status and the U.S. Congress formally created Dakota Territory. It became an organized territory on March 2, 1861. Upon creation, Dakota Territory included much of present-day Montana and Wyoming as well as all of present-day North Dakota and South Dakota and a small portion of present-day Nebraska. A small patch of land known as \\"Lost Dakota\\" existed as a remote exclave of Dakota Territory until it became part of Gallatin County, Montana Territory, in 1873. All land north of the Keya Paha River (which includes most of Boyd County, Nebraska, and a smaller portion of neighboring Keya Paha County) was originally part of Dakota Territory, but was transferred to Nebraska in 1882. American Civil War Dakota Territory was not directly involved in the American Civil War but did raise some troops to defend the settlements following the Dakota War of 1862 which triggered hostilities with the Sioux tribes of Dakota Territory. The Department of the Northwest sent expeditions into Dakota Territory in 1863, 1864 and 1865. It also established forts in Dakota Territory to protect the frontier settlements of the Territory, Iowa and Minnesota and the traffic along the Missouri River. Prior to statehood Historical coat of arms of the Dakota Territory (illustrated in 1876) Following the Civil War, hostilities continued with the Sioux until the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. By 1868, creation of new territories reduced Dakota Territory to the present boundaries of the Dakotas. Territorial counties were defined in 1872, including Bottineau County, Cass County and others. During the existence of the organized territory, the population first increased very slowly and then very rapidly with the \\"Dakota Boom\\" from 1870 to 1880.The New Encyclopedia of the American West. Ed. Howard R. Lamar. 1998 Yale University Press, New Haven. pp. 282 Because the Sioux were considered very hostile and a threat to early settlers, the white population grew slowly. Gradually, the settlers' population grew and the Sioux were not considered as severe a threat.Encyclopedia of the American West. Ed. Charles Philips and Alan Axelrod. 1996 Macmillan Reference USA, New York. pp.1200‚Äì1201 The population increase can largely be attributed to the growth of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Settlers who came to the Dakota Territory were from other western territories as well as many from northern and western Europe. These included large numbers of Norwegians, Germans, Swedes, and Canadians.John H. Hudson, \\"Migration to an American Frontier,\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers,(June 1976), 243‚Äì244 Commerce was originally organized around the fur trade. Furs were carried by steamboat along the rivers to the settlements. Gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874 and attracted more settlers, setting off the last Sioux War. The population surge increased the demand for meat spurring expanded cattle ranching on the territory's vast open ranges. With the advent of the railroad agriculture intensified: wheat became the territory's main cash crop. Economic hardship hit the territory in the 1880s due to lower wheat prices and a drought.The New Encyclopedia of the American West, 282 Map of the Dakota Territory, c. 1886 The territorial capital was Yankton from 1861 until 1883, when it was moved to Bismarck. The Dakota Territory was divided into the states of North Dakota and South Dakota on November 2, 1889. The admission of two states, as opposed to one, was done for a number of reasons. The two population centers in the territory were in the northeast and southeast corners of the territory, several hundred miles away from each other. On a national level, there was pressure from the Republican Party to admit two states to add to their political power in the Senate.Heather Cox Richardson, Wounded Knee: Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre, Basic Books, 2013 . Admission of new western states was a party political battleground with each party looking at how the proposed new states were likely to vote. At the beginning of 1888, the Democrats under president Grover Cleveland proposed that the four territories of Montana, New Mexico, Dakota and Washington should be admitted together. The first two were expected to vote Democratic and the latter two were expected to vote Republican so this was seen as a compromise acceptable to both parties. However, the Republicans won majorities in both the House and the Senate later that year. To head off the possibility that Congress might only admit Republican territories to statehood, the Democrats agreed to a less favorable deal in which Dakota was divided in two and New Mexico was left out altogether. Cleveland signed it into law on February 22, 1889, and the territories could become states in nine months time after that. However, incoming Republican president Benjamin Harrison had a problem with South Dakota; most of the territory was Sioux reservation land and the state would not be viable unless much of this land became available to settlers. There had been previous attempts to open up the territory, but these had foundered because the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) required that 75% of Sioux adult males on the reservation had to agree to any treaty change. Most recently, a commission headed by Richard Henry Pratt in 1888 had completely failed to get the necessary signatures in the face of opposition from Sioux leaders and even government worker Elaine Goodale, later Superintendent of Indian Education for the Dakotas. The government believed that the Dawes Act (1887), which attempted to move the Indians from hunting to farming, in theory, meant that they needed less land (but in reality was an economic disaster for them) and that at least half was available for sale. Congress approved an offer of $1.25 per acre for reservation land (a figure they had previously rejected as outrageously high) and $25,000 to induce the Indians to sign. A new commission was appointed in April 1889 that included veteran Indian fighter general George Crook. Crook pulled out all the stops to get the Indians to sign, using a number of underhand tactics. He threatened them that if they did not sign, the land would be taken anyway and they would get nothing. This would not have been seen as an idle threat; the treaty had been ignored in the past when the Black Hills were taken from the Sioux. Crook ignored leaders like Sitting Bull and Red Cloud who opposed the sale and kept them out of the negotiations, preferring instead to deal with moderate leaders like American Horse. American Horse, however, claimed immediately afterwards that he had been tricked into signing. Crook made many personal promises (such as on reservation rations) which he had no authority to make, or ability to keep. He claimed afterwards that he had only agreed to report the concerns back to Washington. Crook lied about how many signatures he already had, giving the impression that the signature he was currently asking for would make no difference. He said that those who did not sign would not get a share of the money for the land. Crook even allowed white men who had married Sioux to sign, a dubious action given that the blood quantum laws only counted full-blood Indians as members of the tribe. By August 6, 1889, Crook had the requisite number of signatures, half the reservation land was sold, and the remainder divided among six smaller reservations. North Dakota and South Dakota became states simultaneously on November 2, 1889. President Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.

He represented the Dakota Territory as a non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives. He is an American man. Biography Walter was born in Waterville, Maine on October 25, 1820. He served in the Aroostook War in 1839, studied medicine in Burlington, Vermont and Manhattan, New York City, and began his practice in Richmond, Maine. In 1852 he moved to Kittanning, Pennsylvania. Then, around 1861, he became an Indian agent at Greenwood, Dakota Territory (in what is now the Yankton Sioux Reservation in Charles Mix County, South Dakota). Some Yankton Sioux Indians complained bitterly of mistreatment by Burleigh. The testimony of Strike the Ree and Medicine Cow to a Special Joint Committee on the Condition of the Indian Tribes in 1865 suggests that Burleigh was self-serving and corrupt in his dealings with the Indians. Burleigh was elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives, serving from March 4, 1865 ‚Äì March 3, 1869. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1868. He was a member of the Dakota Territorial council in 1877, then worked as a contractor and in farming, and moved to Miles City, Montana 1879, where he practiced law. He served as a member of the special session of the Montana Territorial council in 1887 and as a delegate to the convention that framed the constitution of Montana in 1889. He was a member of the first State House of Representatives, and served as prosecuting attorney of Custer County. Burleigh returned to South Dakota in 1893, resumed the practice of law, and served in the State Senate. He died in Yankton, Yankton County, South Dakota, and is buried in the Yankton Cemetery. Burleigh County, North Dakota is named for him.

It occupies the center of the western half of the province, connecting with the towns (concellos) of Taboadela, Paderne, Sandi√°s, Vilar de Santos, Rairiz de Veiga, Xunqueira de Amb√≠a, A Merca and A Bola. The area of the municipality is 85,3 km¬≤ and there are 6.188 inhabitants in 16 parishes. The hydrographic system is made up of the River Arnoia, which crosses the municipality from east to west. The surrounding hills are covered with pine and native oak. The valley itself is very fertile and the river banks are lined with trees, making the setting one of special beauty. The climate can be defined as inland Atlantic with continental influences. Summers are warm with highs averaging 25 ¬∞C, while winter highs average 12 ¬∞C. Allariz is a town which relies on tourism and proximity to the provincial capital of Ourense, fifteen kilometers away. Because of its picturesque location on the banks of the Arnoia, it is a sought-after location for summer houses. The main highway crossing the south of Galicia, the Autovia das Rias Baixas, crosses the Arnoia on one of the longest highway bridges in Spain and provides easy access to the town. History Local life had its origin in the castro which dominates the Arnoia. Little is known about development of the town until the barbarian invasions of the seventh century. Legends attribute its foundation to the Suevian chieftain Alaric. All that is known is that its first name was Villa Alaricii. In the twelfth century a royal fortress of the Galaico-Leonese dynasty was built on the hill overlooking the modern town. Between the years 1132 and 1140 it was the key in the wars against the expansion of Portugal, and thanks to its defense the south of Galicia was not absorbed into Portugal. Alfonso VII of Castile gave it the title of town or foro. Everything indicates that the Castle of Allariz was always a residence of the royal families and place of education for the princes. At the end of the fourteenth century the opposition between the royal power, represented by Allariz, and the episcopal power of Ourense increased. In 1446 Juan II of Castile gave the town to the Count of Benavente, who wanted it for his designs of dominating Galicia. In 1471 the Irmandi√±os de Galicia besieged the castle, helped by the people in the town. This famous siege lasted nine months. Later powerful families built their houses and palaces. New churches were built and Allariz lived an era of prosperity, as it had before under royal protection. The French invasion during the Peninsular War destroyed many churches and caused great loss in the town, but the army of Soult, defeated in Porto, found refuge in the town. The period of desamortization (19th century) ruined the Monastery and was the cause of the destruction of the castle and the town walls, whose stones were used to build the road to Ourense. Vilanova Bridge, Allariz Allariz had a Jewish community ever since the 11th century. Upon a complaint of the prior of the monastery of Allariz in 1289, the Jewish congregation of the town was notified that they were no longer permitted to live outside the Jewish quarter. Christians were also prohibited from living in that quarter.http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1253-allariz Politics {  style=\\"margin:0 auto\\" + - ! colspan=\\"11\\" width=\\"600px\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" Municipal elections - bgcolor=\\"#D8D8D8\\"  Party/List  align=\\"right\\"  1979  align=\\"right\\"  1983  align=\\"right\\"  1987Direcci√≥n General de Pol√≠tica Interior  align=\\"right\\"  1991  align=\\"right\\"  1995  align=\\"right\\"  1999  align=\\"right\\"  2003  align=\\"right\\"  2007  align=\\"right\\"  2011Elecciones Locales 2011  align=\\"right\\"  2015Elecciones Locales 2015 -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  BNPG / BNG  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  5  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  2  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  4  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  10  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  10  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  10  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  8  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  9  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  9  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  9 -  bgcolor=\\"#1E90FF\\"  AP / PP  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  6  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  5  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  2  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  2  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  3  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  4  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  3  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  4  bgcolor=\\"#87CEFA\\" align=\\"right\\"  3 -  bgcolor=\\"#FF4500\\"  PSdeG-PSOE  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FF6347\\" align=\\"right\\"  2  bgcolor=\\"#FF6347\\" align=\\"right\\"  2  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FF6347\\" align=\\"right\\"  -  bgcolor=\\"#FF6347\\" align=\\"right\\"  1  bgcolor=\\"#FF6347\\" align=\\"right\\"  1  bgcolor=\\"#FF6347\\" align=\\"right\\"  -  bgcolor=\\"#FF6347\\" align=\\"right\\"  1 -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  CG / CPG  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  3  bgcolor=\\"\\" align=\\"right\\"  2  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"  -  bgcolor=\\"#32CD32\\"  EU  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#7CFC00\\" align=\\"right\\"  1  bgcolor=\\"#7CFC00\\" align=\\"right\\"  -  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"  -  bgcolor=\\"#FFA500\\"  UCD / CDS  bgcolor=\\"#FFC000\\" align=\\"right\\"  8  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFC000\\" align=\\"right\\"  1  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"   bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"right\\"  - - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\"  Total  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13  align=\\"right\\"  13 } Tourist sites The Arnoia river Allariz constitutes one of the most important historical-artistic sites of Galicia. In the town there are admirable examples of military, religious, and civil elements. Today it preserves its medieval character, reflected in its monuments and in its cobblestone streets. We must mention the chapel of San Bieito and the Real Mosteiro de Santa Clara, with one of the largest cloisters in Spain. A fundamental example of Galego popular romanesque architecture is the parish church of Santiago and the bridge of Vilanova. The highlight of the town is doubtlessly the area around the Arnoia River, which has been converted into a parkland with paths following the riverbanks under ancient oak trees. Abandoned leather factories have been restored and converted into restaurants and a museum. Festa do Boi (Festival of the Ox) According to this legend, with heavy anti-semitic overtones, the festival began in the Middle Ages. The Jewish community tried to ruin the procession of Corpus Christi when it was crossing their street on the way to the Church of Santo Estevo. Supposedly the Jews insulted the people, made fun of the religious symbols and provoked the priests and monks. This is when Xan de Arz√∫a appeared, a man of religious convictions, who decided to appear one year riding a bull pulled by his servants who carried sacks with ants and ashes to throw at the faces of the disrespectful Jews. In memory of this happening, every year during the festival of Corpus Christi, garlanded oxen run through the streets of the town. Flour with ants is also thrown at bystanders to remember the legendary Xan de Arz√∫a. A cloth figure representing Xan is carried in procession to the town hall where it is hung on the balcony. The original anti-semitic background to the festival has been forgotten by most modern viewers.

The tant≈ç dates to the Heian period, when it was mainly used as a weapon but evolved in design over the years to become more ornate. Tant≈ç were used in traditional martial arts (tantojutsu). The term has seen a resurgence in the West since the 1980s as a point style of modern tactical knives, designed for piercing or stabbing. Description The tant≈ç is a sword, but is used as a knife. The blade is single or double edged with a length between 15 and 30 cm (1 Japanese shaku). The tant≈ç was designed primarily as a stabbing weapon, but the edge can be used for slashing as well. Tant≈ç are generally forged in hira- zukuri style (without ridgeline),Styles in the Shape of Blades meaning that their sides have no ridge line and are nearly flat, unlike the shinogi-zukuri structure of a katana. Some tant≈ç have particularly thick cross-sections for armor-piercing duty, and are called yoroi toshi. Tant≈ç were mostly carried by samurai, as commoners did not generally wear them. Women sometimes carried a small tant≈ç called a kaikenKaiken in their obi primarily for self-defense. Tant≈ç were sometimes worn as the sh≈çt≈ç in place of a wakizashi in a daish≈ç,The Japanese sword, Kanzan Sat≈ç, Kodansha International, 1983 P.68Shotokan's Secret: The Hidden Truth Behind Karate's Fighting Origins, Bruce D. Clayton, Black Belt Communications, 2004 P106 especially on the battlefield. Before the advent of the wakizashi/tant≈ç combination, it was common for a samurai to carry a tachi and a tant≈ç as opposed to a katana and a wakizashi. It has been noted that the tachi would be paired with a tant≈ç and later the uchigatana would be paired with another shorter uchigatana. With the advent of the katana, the wakizashi eventually was chosen by samurai as the short sword over the tant≈ç. Kanzan Sat≈ç in his book The Japanese sword notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the wakizashi and suggests that the wakizashi may have become more popular than the tant≈ç due to the wakizashi being more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the wakizashi inside.The Japanese sword, Kanzan Sat≈ç, Kodansha International, 1983 P.68 History of tant≈ç in Japan The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods: * Jokoto (ancient swords, until around 900 A.D.) * Koto (old swords from around 900‚Äì1596) * Shinto (new swords 1596‚Äì1780) * Shinshinto (new new swords 1781‚Äì1876) * Gendaito (modern swords 1876‚Äì1945) * Shinsakuto (newly made swords 1953‚Äìpresent) Heian to Muromachi Tant≈ç by Hy≈´ga Masamune, 24.8cm, Unsigned Masamune, Formerly in the possession of Ishida Mitsunari, who gave it to his brother-in-law; the tant≈ç was stolen during the Battle of Sekigahara by Mizuno Katsushige, governor of Hy≈´ga Province, Kamakura period, Mitsui Memorial Museum, Tokyo. The tant≈ç was invented partway through the Heian period. With the beginning of the Kamakura period, tant≈ç were forged to be more aesthetically pleasing, and hira and uchi-sori tant≈ç becoming the most popular styles. Near the middle of the Kamakura period, more tant≈ç artisans were seen, increasing the abundance of the weapon, and the kanmuri-otoshi style became prevalent in the cities of Kyoto and Yamato. Because of the style introduced by the tachi in the late Kamakura period, tant≈ç began to be forged longer and wider. The introduction of the Hachiman faith became visible in the carvings in the hilts around this time. The hamon (line of temper) is similar to that of the tachi, except for the absence of choji-midare, which is nioi and utsuri. Gunomi-midare and suguha are found to have taken its place. During the era of the Northern and Southern Courts, the tant≈ç were forged to be up to forty centimeters as opposed to the normal one shaku (about thirty centimeters) length. The blades became thinner between the ura and the omote, and wider between the ha and mune. At this point in time, two styles of hamon were prevalent: the older style, which was subtle and artistic, and the newer, more popular style. With the beginning of the Muromachi period, constant fighting caused the mass production of blades, meaning that with higher demand, lower-quality blades were manufactured. Blades that were custom-forged still were of exceptional quality, but the average blade suffered greatly. As the end of the period neared, the average blade narrowed and the curvature shallowed. Momoyama to the early Edo period Antique Japanese tant≈ç shown dis-assembled, British Museum. Approximately two hundred and fifty years of peace accompanied the unification of Japan, in which there was little need for blades. In this period, both the katana and wakizashi were invented, taking the place of the tant≈ç and tachi as the most-used pair of weapons, and the number of tant≈ç forged was severely decreased. The only tant≈ç produced during this period of peace were copies of others from earlier eras.Sat≈ç (1983) p. 68 Late Edo period There were still a few tant≈ç being forged during this period, and the ones that were forged reflected the work of the Kamakura, Nambokucho, or Muromachi eras. Suishinshi Masahide was a main contributor towards the forging of tant≈ç during this age. There are now only prehistoric tant≈ç being used in combat. Meiji to present Many tant≈ç were forged before World War II, due to the restoration of the Emperor to power. Members of the Imperial Court began wearing the set of tachi and tant≈ç once more, and the number of tant≈ç in existence increased dramatically. After World War II, a restriction on sword forging caused tant≈ç manufacture to fall very low. American and European interest in Japanese martial arts since the war created a demand for the tant≈ç outside Japan from the 1960s through the present time. Types of tant≈ç Blade types The general blade shape is approximately 25 cm long, 17 mm wide (near the tang), 8.0 mm thick (near the tang) and approximately straight. Actual historical examples would vary in length, width, thickness and curvature. (The hira and kiriha sides of the katakiriha blade have been swapped to allow the tip to point consistently to the left while still showing the chisel-like side.) *Hira: A very common tant≈ç form with no shinogi, the edge bevels reaching all the way from the edge (ha) to the back (mune) with no separate flats in between, creating an almost triangular cross-section (the back is ridged, as on most other blade forms, so the cross-section is actually an extremely asymmetrical diamond shape; on shinogi zukuri blades it is hexagonal). It is extremely common due to the simplicity of its design. *Shinogi: This is the most common type of blade geometry for long swords, but tant≈ç made in this form are very rare, usually created from cut-down blades when a longer sword has been broken. Shinogi means the central ridge that runs along the length of the blade between the edge bevels and the body of the blade. *Osoraku: Osoraku zukuri features an extremely long o-kissaki type point, over half the blade's length. *Shobu: A common blade type that is very similar to the shinogi zukuri, except that it lacks a yokote, the distinct angle between the long cutting edge and the point section, and instead the edge curves smoothly and uninterrupted into the point. *Unokubi: An uncommon tant≈ç style akin to the kanmuri-otoshi, with a back that grows abruptly thinner around the middle of the blade, but in the unokubi zukuri it regains its thickness just before the point. There is normally a short, wide groove extending to the midway point on the blade. *Kanmuri-otoshi: These tant≈ç were shaped in hira or shobu style but from about half way to the tip the back edge was sharpened though this second edge was not particularly sharp. They had a groove running halfway up the blade and were similar to the unokubi style tant≈ç. *Kissaki-moroha: A rare blade type with a double-edged point. Unlike the later kanmuri-otoshi the tip had a distinct shape unlike any other tanto: the back edge would curve slightly downwards so that the point was lower than the back of the blade whereas other tanto had the point in line with the back of the blade. Often they had a wide groove in the base half. The most well known historical blade of this type is the tachi Kogarasu Maru, \\"Little Crow\\", one of the National Treasures of Japan. *Moroha: A rare, double-edged tant≈ç type that has a diamond-shaped cross-section. The blade tapers to a point and contains a shinogi that runs to the point. *Yoroi toshi or yoroi doshi: tant≈ç that have particularly thick cross-sections for armor-piercing duty. *Katakiriha: An asymmetric tant≈ç form, sharpened only on one side to create a chisel-shaped cross-section. *Kubikiri: A very rare type; the sharpened blade is on the inside curve rather than the outside. It has no sharpened point, making it difficult to use in battle and enshrouding the weapon in mystery. Kubikiri can be roughly translated to \\"head cutter\\". According to one myth, they were carried by attendants of samurai for cutting off the heads of fallen enemies. There are other speculations existing about the kubikiri's possible uses. Perhaps they were used by doctors or carried by high-ranking officials as a badge is worn today. They could also have been used for cutting charcoal or incense, or used as an artistic tool for pruning bonsai trees.Unusual tant≈ç *Hochogata: A tant≈ç form that is commonly described as a short, wide, hira. The hochogata was one of the blade type that the legendary swordsmith Masamune favored. Mountings (koshirae) *Aikuchi: The aikuchi is a tant≈ç koshirae where the fuchi is flush with the mouth of the sheath. There is no handguard. Aikuchi normally have plain wooden hilts, and many forms of aikuchi have kashira that are made from animal horns. *Hamidashi: The hamidashi is a tant≈ç koshirae that features a small handguard. Other tant≈ç *Kaiken tant≈ç: The kuaiken (also kwaiken or futokoro-gatana) is a generally short tant≈ç that is commonly carried in aikuchi or shirasaya mounts. It was useful for self-defense indoors where the long katana and intermediate wakizashi were inconvenient. Women carried them in the obi for self-defense and rarely for jigai (ritual suicide). A woman received a kaiken as part of her wedding gifts. *Fan Tant≈ç: The fan tant≈ç is a common tant≈ç with a blade entirely concealed within a fan-shaped scabbard. The blade was usually low quality, as this tant≈ç was not designed to be a display piece, but rather a concealed weapon for self-defense. *Yari Tant≈ç: Japanese spearheads were often altered so that it became possible to mount them as tant≈ç. Unlike most blades, yari tant≈ç had triangular cross-sections. *Ken tanto: This is also not truly a tant≈ç, though it is often used and thought of as one. Ken were straight, double-edged blades often used for Buddhist rituals, and could be made from spearheads that were broken or cut shorter. They were often given as offerings from sword smiths when they visited a temple. The hilt of the ken tant≈ç may be found made with a vajra (double thunderbolt related to Buddhism). *Modern tant≈ç: Modern tactical knives have been made by knife makers Bob Lum, Phill Hartsfield, Ernest Emerson, Allen Elishewitz, Bob Terzuola, Strider Knives, Harold J. \\"Kit\\" Carson, Benchmade, Camillus Cutlery Company, Spyderco, Severtech, Ka-Bar, SOG Knives, Columbia River Knife & Tool, and Cold Steel. These \\"American Tant≈ç\\" designs which are often folding knives, feature a thick spine on the blade that goes from the tang to the tip for increased tip strength. The handle shape may be altered slightly to provide better ergonomics. Use in martial arts Tant≈ç with blunt wooden or blunt plastic blades are used to practice martial arts. Versions with a blunt metal blade are used in more advanced training and in demonstrations. Martial arts that employ the tant≈ç include: * Aikido * Aikijutsu * Jujutsu * Koryu Bujutsu * Ninjutsu * Shorinji Kempo * Modern Arnis (taking place of dagger) Image:Yari tanto.JPGEdo period yari (spear) tant≈ç in koshirae.

Jayne then returned to Springfield and continued the practice of medicine. He was appointed U.S. Pension Agent in 1869 for four years and served three terms as mayor of Springfield beginning in 1876. He also served as Director and Vice President of the First National Bank of Springfield. He resumed the practice of medicine in 1873. Jayne married Julia Witherbee in 1850 and had six children with her. He died in Springfield and is interred in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield.

Life and career  Garrick was born Richard Thomas O'Brien in the townland of Portlaw, County Waterford, Ireland. His father, James E. O'Brien, was a master tailor in that town, counting among his clients Lord Waterford as well as other nobility and landed gentry. In 1882, James left Portlaw for the United States. He landed in North Adams, Massachusetts, where there were cotton mills and the need for a clothesmaker. Two years later, his wife Johanna and children followed. In 1898, Garrick enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served as a corporal in Company M, U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment stationed in Miagao, Iloilo, in the Philippines in 1900 during the Philippine-American War. When he returned to North Adams, he worked for a time in his father's tailor shop, then struck out on his own. The Doctor (Richard Garrick) and Nurse (Ann Were) subdue an hysterical Blanche (Jessica Tandy) in the original New York product of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. He ventured to New York City where he landed roles in stage productions, among them The Boys of Company B (1907), The Flag Lieutenant (1909), The Fourth Estate, (1909), and The Monkey's Paw. By 1912 Garrick was in Los Angeles and became a charter member of The Reel Club. Through the early 1910s, Garrick acted in, as well as directed, silent films, including Colonel Custard's Last Stand (1914). In 1915, he joined the Gaumont Company and was placed in charge of the second Rialto Star Feature Company. By 1916, Garrick was the director general of Gaumont's Jacksonville, Florida, studios. He left Gaumont to open Garrick Studios Company, offering a five-acre (20,000 m¬≤) facility in Jacksonville that would house enough equipment and space for 20 companies to work simultaneously. As the 1916‚Äì1917 season approached, however, the mood towards making films in Jacksonville shifted, and many residents opposed the industry's presence. Garrick went overseas in 1919 and directed films in London and Paris. In 1922, he was named production manager of a new film corporation in Italy. Overall, he directed 30 silent films during his career. When he returned to the United States, it was to pursue his first love ‚Äî stage acting.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30799491/tells-of-movies-of-30-years- ago/?xid=865 During World War II, he was among the cast of Ten Little Indians, a production of the U.S. Army Special Service/USO Camp Shows in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations. In 1947, Garrick was once again on stage in New York City, performing as the mental-health doctor or \\"stranger\\" in the original production of A Streetcar Named Desire, which co-starred Marlon Brando and Jessica Tandy. He reprised that role in the 1951 film version of the play. His appearances in both the play and film adaptation marked the start of a second film career for Garrick. During the 1950s, he played small supporting roles in numerous Hollywood movies. His television acting credits include the role of Benjamin Franklin in Night Strike on Calvacade of America (April 29, 1953 and October 19, 1954); and the role of Thaddeus Grimshaw in the episode Royal Carriage on My Friend Flicka (March 16, 1956). Throughout his career, Garrick performed along with some of the brightest actors and actresses in stage and film history, including James Arness, Ed Begley, Marlon Brando, Lee J. Cobb, James Dean, Julie Harris, Brian Keith, Charles Laughton, Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden, Victor Mature, Ethel Merman, Marilyn Monroe, Patricia Neal, Donald O'Connor, Maureen O'Sullivan, Anthony Quinn, Ronald Reagan, Ginger Rogers, Jean Simmons, Richard Todd, Spencer Tracy, Robert Wagner, John Wayne, Dennis Weaver and Richard Widmark. Garrick taught at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and in 1930 he opened the Richard Garrick studio in Santa Ana, California, to teach drama, English, public speaking, and other subjects to aspiring actors. Garrick died on August 21, 1962, in Los Angeles and is buried as a U.S. veteran at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California.

Its original purpose was to discuss the relationship between suicide rates and holiday seasons. However, it has since evolved into a broad discussion forum where suicidal people can openly share their thoughts. Some participants are not suicidal, but post to provide psychological support and other input to suicidal or depressed posters. The newsgroup is unmoderated and subject to a high level of trolling and a harsh and sometimes hostile atmosphere. According to its FAQ, its purpose is neither to encourage nor discourage suicide, maintaining the stance of pro-choice rather than pro-suicide. \\"Living as a suicidal, in defense of ASH\\" explains the ideologies and debate of ASH's 'voluntary life' concept. Since 2019, the website is no longer publicly accessible. Effects Recent research shows that suicide websites indeed could be more efficient in providing emotional help for people contemplating suicide than suicide hotlines. Primary reasons are asynchronous nature of discussion in newsgroups giving enough time for thoughtful response and group- based discussion that suicidal people find reassuring. High degree of anonymity is another advantage of newsgroups like a.s.h, allowing people to openly talk about their feelings without fear of consequences. UK Byron Review for 2008, analyzing effects of websites on children, says that \\"research looking at pro-suicide sites has had mixed results. Some studies report high degrees of emotional and social support by these sites, particularly on sites where the methods of suicide were not discussed. More studies like this are needed to begin to understand the impact of such sites on those who spontaneously choose to access them.\\" A point of view often expressed on a.s.h itself is that the existence of a.s.h actually prevented many deaths by allowing people considering suicide to connect with others who have the same feelings and giving them a place where they don't have to hide their true feelings. Suicide information A.s.h does not censor information on suicide methods and does not prohibit such discussion. Opponents see discussion of suicide methods as potentially endangering vulnerable people - people who would otherwise live through crisis, might commit suicide given information on lethal methods. Supporters of open discussion state that methods information is widely and legally available; that information might prevent number of permanent injuries resulting from lack of knowledge about methods, like paracetamol overdoses. Finally, there is no indication that making such information available changed suicide rates. For example, in 1991 Final Exit was published; it was the first book giving how-to advice on certain suicide methods. The book was the number one bestselling nonfiction book in America for 18 weeks, and has sold over a million copies. At the same time, there was no remarkable increase in suicide rates.Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences by Geo Stone. Carroll & Graf Pub (February 1999) Coverage in the news The newsgroup has been a target of news reports alleging a direct relationship between \\"avoidable\\" suicides and the suicide- facilitating nature of the newsgroup and web site. In 2003, a.s.h was the topic of a series of Wired articles under the pretext of examining the group's role in the deaths of several depressed individuals. The accuracy and integrity of the articles was widely disputed by ashers and internet media critics, e.g., Ken Hagler's Radio Weblog: No One Asked Why He Wanted to Die. A.s.h played some role in the death of Suzy Gonzales, who killed herself in 2003 after sharing her thoughts on a.s.h. In the US, the death of Suzy Gonzales led to an attempt to introduce a controversial H.R. 940: Suzanne Gonzales Suicide Prevention Act of 2007, which did not pass. The current version of the bill is HR 1183: Suzanne Gonzales Suicide Prevention Act of 2011. The community received further media attention due to the case of William Francis Melchert-Dinkel, who was charged with encouraging the suicides of a person in Britain in 2005 and another person in Canada in 2008 through a.s.h.

Painting by Luca Giordano Spiritual warfare is the Christian concept of fighting against the work of preternatural evil forces. It is based on the biblical belief in evil spirits, or demons, that are said to intervene in human affairs in various ways. Although spiritual warfare is a prominent feature of neo-charismatic churches, various Christian groups have adopted practices to repel such forces, as based on their doctrine of Christian demonology, too. Prayer is a common form of spiritual warfare among Christians. Other practices may include exorcism, the laying on of hands, fasting with prayer, praise and worship, and anointing with oil.  Doctrines of demonology  Jewish demonology escalated with the rise of Jewish pseudepigraphic writings of the 1st Century BCE, in particular with Enochic apocrypha. Jewish apocrypha initially influenced post-New Testament writings of the early fathers, which further defined Christian demonology. Thus followed literary works such as The Didache, The Shepherd of Hermas, Ignatius's epistle to the Ephesians, and Origen's Contra Celsum. Mainstream Christianity typically acknowledge a belief in the reality (or ontological existence) of demons, fallen angels, the Devil in Christianity and Satan. In Christian evangelism, doctrines of demonology are influenced by interpretations of the New Testament, namely with the Gospels, in that dealing with spirits became a customary activity of Jesus' ministry. Mark states that \\"he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons\\" (Mark 1:39).Arnold, 1997, p. 20 Exorcisms may be promoted by evangelists referring to Jesus comment, \\"If I drive out demons by the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is upon you\\" (Matt.12:28; Luke 11:20). Evangelical Christian traditions believe that Satan and his minions exercise significant influence over this world and its power structures. A hostile realm in conflict with the kingdom of God is recorded in the Bible by the Apostle John, \\"the whole world is under the control of the evil one\\" (1 John 5:19) and by Jesus who referred to Satan as \\"the prince of this world\\" (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11), which may point to the concept of Territorial Spirits. Paul elaborates on demonic hierarchy in Ephesians 6Eph. 6:12 KJV where he also mentions, by way of metaphor, those qualities needed for defense against them.Full Armor of God in Ephesians, KJV Two of those articles, the helmet of Salvation and the breastplate of Righteousness, are also mentioned in the book of Isaiah.Isa. 59:17 KJV It is also believed that Satan occupies a temporal existence when the Apostle Paul refers to him as \\"the god of this age\\" (2 Cor.4:4). Further, Paul's epistles focus on the Victory of Christ over principalities and powers. Evangelical interpretation has history divided into two eras: the present evil age and the age to come which supports the concept of the Second coming of Christ. Imagery of spiritual warfare is displayed in the Book of Revelation when after the War in Heaven (Rev.12:7), the beasts and kings of the earth wage war against God's people (Rev.19:19), and a final battle ensues with Satan and the nations of the earth against God himself (Rev.20:8).Arnold, 1997, p. 23 Practices in Christianity The Spiritual Warfare (c1623), a print by Martin Droeshout depicting the devil's army besieging a walled city held by a \\"Christian Soldier bold\\" guarded by figures representing the Christian virtues. It has been suggested that this print may have influenced John Bunyan to write The Holy War.Jones, Malcolm, \\"The English Print\\", in Hattaway, Michael, A Companion to English Renaissance Literature and Culture, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p.360.Zinck, Arlette, \\"Dating The Spiritual Warfare Broadsheet\\", The Recorder: Newsletter of the International John Bunyan Society, 2007, pp.3-4. Christian practices of spiritual warfare vary throughout Christianity. The development of specific spiritual warfare techniques has also generated many discussions in the Christian missions community. Critical exchanges of views may be found in periodicals like the Evangelical Missions Quarterly (such as in volume 31, number 2 published in 1995), and in conferences sponsored by the Evangelical Missions Society. In 2000, an international collaborative attempt was made by evangelicals and charismatics in the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization to reach some common agreement about spiritual warfare. The conference gathered in Nairobi, Kenya, and yielded a consultation document as well as many technical papers published as the book Deliver Us from Evil. Spiritual warfare has also been practiced by non-Christians and in non-Christian countries. According to the Christian Broadcasting Network commentator Carl Moeller, spiritual warfare is practiced even in North Korea, a country that has been described as the most dangerous place on earth to be Christian.\\"North Korea Spiritual Warfare: Insights from Carl Moeller\\", Christian Broadcasting Network, 12-3-2010, Non- Christian media reported on the African spiritual warrior Pastor Thomas Muthee visit to America who prayed over a 2008 presidential candidate. The Nigerian Tribune, the oldest surviving private newspaper in Nigeria, has published articles calling for the need for spiritual warfare.Casualties in the ministry, John Odejayi, Nigerian Tribune, Sunday, 12-12-2010, In the case of Haiti, American televangelist Pat Robertson and others blamed the earthquake of 2010 on demons, and called for Christians to increase spiritual warfare prayer. Expositors of spiritual warfare include Jessie Penn-Lewis, who published the Pentecostal 1903 book, War on the Saints,‚ÄúWar on the Saints‚Äù, Jessie Penn-Lewis, 1973 prolific author Pastor Win Worley started publishing his Hosts of Hell series in 1976, and Kurt E. Koch published Occult ABC,\\"Occult ABC\\", Kurt E. Koch, 1973 which all contain elements of the concept of spiritual warfare, if not explicitly using the expression. In 1991, C. Peter Wagner published Confronting the Powers: How the New Testament Church Experienced the Power of Strategic-Level Spiritual Warfare and edited Territorial Spirits.‚ÄùConfronting the Powers: How the New Testament Church Experienced the Power of Strategic-Level Spiritual Warfare‚Äù, C. Peter Wagner, 1991Territorial Spirits, C. Peter Wagner, ed., 1991 In 1992, Dr. Ed Murphy wrote a modern 600 page book on the subject, ‚ÄúThe Handbook of Spiritual Warfare‚Äú, from the point of view of deliverance ministry.‚ÄúThe Handbook of Spiritual Warfare‚Äú, Ed Murphy Laws of Deliverance, From Proverbs, 1980, 1983, 1995, 2000, 2003, written by Marilyn A. Ellsworth, is another important Biblical work of authority, as is her book ICBM Spiritual Warfare, God's Unbeatable Plan. Other notable expositions on spiritual warfare were written by Pastor Win Worley, Mark Bubeck, and Neil Anderson.  Catholicism  Pope John Paul II stated, ‚Äú‚ÄòSpiritual combat‚Äô... is a secret and interior art, an invisible struggle in which monks engage every day against the temptations‚Äù.ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER, 5-25-02, APOSTOLIC VISIT OF HIS HOLINESS POPE JOHN PAUL II TO AZERBAIJAN AND BULGARIA, In modern times the views of individual Roman Catholics have tended to divide into traditional and more modern understandings of the subject. An example of a more modern view of the demonic is found in the work of the Dominican scholar Richard Woods' The Devil. The traditional outlook is represented by Father Gabriele Amorth who has written three books on his personal experiences as an exorcist for the Vatican: An Exorcist Tells His Story, and An Exorcist: More Stories, and An Exorcist Explains the Demonic: The Antics of Satan and His Army of Fallen Angels. Francis MacNutt, who was a priest within the Roman Catholic Charismatic Movement, has also addressed the subject of the demonic in his writings about healing.  Reformation  The practice of exorcism was also known among the first generation of teachers and pastors in the Lutheran Reformation. Johannes Bugenhagen was the pastor of the Wittenberg town church and officiated at Martin Luther's wedding. In a letter addressed to Luther and Melanchthon dated November 1530, Pomeranus recounted his experience of dealing with a young girl who showed signs of demon possession. Pomeranus' method involved counseling the girl concerning her previous baptismal vows, he invoked the name of Christ and prayed with her. (Letter reproduced in Montgomery, Principalities and Powers). The Anglican-Puritan writer William Gurnall wrote a lengthy three-volume work The Christian in Complete Armour that was published between 1662 and 1665. In this work Gurnall stressed the place of reading Scripture, prayer and the name of Christ. Evangelicalism  In the American revival tradition among evangelicals, prominent preachers such as D. L. Moody, Billy Sunday, R. A. Torrey and Billy Graham have all affirmed their belief in the existence of the demonic and had occasions to recount some of their own spiritual warfare encounters. In the nineteenth century, one of the major evangelical authorities on demon possession was the missionary to China, John Livingstone Nevius. During the late twentieth century, evangelical writers such as Mark Bubeck and Merrill Unger presented their theological and pastoral response to demonic phenomena. The problem of demon possession and spiritual warfare became the subject of a Christian Medical Association symposium that was held in 1975. This symposium brought together a range of evangelical scholars in biblical studies, theology, psychology, anthropology, and missiology (see Montgomery, ). One of the very significant German writers is the Lutheran Kurt E. Koch whose work has influenced much of both evangelical and charismatic thought in the late twentieth century. The impact of his ideas has been recently examined by the folklore specialist Bill Ellis.  Pentecostalism  Spiritual warfare has become a prominent feature in Pentecostal traditions. The concept is well embedded in Pentecostal history, particularly through Jessie Penn-Lewis's book War on the Saints arising from the Welsh Revival in the early twentieth century. However, Jessie Penn-Lewis preaches a very different kind of spiritual warfare than that preached by the third-wave Charismatic movement of today‚Äînotably C. Peter Wagner and Cindy Jacobs. Other Pentecostal and charismatic pastors include Don Basham, Derek Prince, Win Worley, Bishop Larry Gaiters, Dr. Marcus Haggard, and Missionary Norman Parish, who have emphasized using the power of the blood of Christ in the deliverance ministry. Spiritual Mapping & the Charismatic movement Spiritual mapping refers to the 21st century Evangelical belief that all history is a battle between Satan and God. Neo-Evangelicals who follow the spiritual mapping movement perceive the world in terms of demonic activity and believe that they can use prayer and other Evangelical religious practices to counteract evil in the world. According to the Christian Science Monitor, \\"C. Peter Wagner, head of Global Harvest Ministries in Colorado Springs, Colo., is in the vanguard of the spiritual warfare movement.\\" In the version of spiritual warfare of Wagner and his associates and followers, \\"spiritual mapping\\" or \\"mapping\\" involves research and prayer, either to locate specific individuals who are then accused of witchcraft, or to locate individuals, groups, or locations that are thought to be victims of witchcraft or possessed by demons, against which spiritual warfare is then waged.‚ÄúBreaking Strongholds in Your City: How to Use \\"Spiritual Mapping\\" To make Your Prayers More Strategic, Effective and Targeted (Prayer Warriors)\\", Peter C. Wagner, June 1993 Peter Wagner claims that this type of spiritual warfare was \\"virtually unknown to the majority of Christians before the 1990s\\".\\"Confronting the Powers: How the New Testament Church Experienced the Power of Strategic-Level Spiritual Warfare\\", C. Peter Wagner, 1991, p21 According to Wagner, the basic methodology is to use spiritual mapping to locate areas, demon-possessed persons, occult practitioners such as witches and Freemasons, or occult idol objects like statues of Catholic saints,\\"War on the Saints\\", Jessie Penn-Lewis which are then named and fought, using methods ranging from intensive prayer to burning with fire. \\"[T]hey must burn the idols‚Ä¶ the kinds of material things that might be bringing honor to the spirits of darkness: pictures, statues, Catholic saints, Books of Mormon‚Ä¶ [T]he witches and warlocks had surrounded the area‚Ä¶ When the flames shot up, a woman right behind Doris [Wagner's wife] screamed and manifested a demon, which Doris immediately cast out!\\"\\"Hard-Core Idolatry, Facing the Facts\\", C.

Criticism  Outside of evangelicalism, many Christians explicitly reject the concept of Spiritual warfare. In Germany the Evangelic Lutheran Church and the evangelical German Evangelical Alliance consider it to be \\"unbiblical\\".,https://www.ead.de/nachrichten- ead/2001/september/04092001-deutsche-evangelische-allianz-steht-kritisch-zur- gebetsinitiative-gegen-die-koenigin-des-himmels Deutsche Evangelische Allianz steht kritisch zur Gebetsinitiative gegen die \\"K√∂nigin des Himmels.\\" Gegen territoriale Kampff√ºhrung im Gebet (in German) stating \\"The aggressive attitude and the presumption to fight against evil alongside or even instead of Christ, stands in opposition to the spirit of the gospel.\\" In evangelism and worldwide Christian missions, former missionaries such as Charles Kraft and C. Peter Wagner have emphasized problems with demonic influences on the world mission fields and the need to drive demons out. Robert Guelich of Fuller Theological Seminary has questioned the extent to which spiritual warfare has shifted from its basic moorings from being a metaphor for the Christian life. He underlines how spiritual warfare has evolved into \\"spiritual combat\\" techniques for Christians to seek power over demons. Guelich argues that Paul's writings in the Epistle to the Ephesians are focused on proclaiming the peace of God and nowhere specify any techniques for battling demons. He also finds that the novels of Frank Peretti are seriously at odds with both the gospel narratives on demons and Pauline teaching. Missions specialists such Scott Moreau and Paul Hiebert have detected traces of animist thought encroaching on both evangelical and charismatic discourses about the demonic and spiritual warfare. Hiebert indicates that a dualist cosmology now appears in some spiritual warfare texts and it is based on the Greco-Roman mystery religions and Zoroastrian myths. However, Hiebert also chastises other evangelicals who have absorbed the modern secular outlook and have tended to downplay or even ignore the demonic. Hiebert speaks of the flaw of the excluded middle in the thinking of some evangelicals who have a cosmology of God in heaven and humans on earth, but have ignored the \\"middle\\" realm of the angelic and demonic. Some critics have linked the rise in aggressive forms of prayer to the increasing militarization of everyday life that characterizes twentieth century cultural shifts towards the widespread normalization of highly militarized discourse. This rhetorical and ideological stance has crept into the practices and rituals of religious prayer and conversion, just as it has similarly expanded into sectors like technology, immigration, humanitarianism and education, just to name a few spheres that have also been influenced by Militarism. Despite the seeming opposition between the submissive and morally upstanding associations with prayer and dominating violence associated with militarism, these two spheres interact in a dialectical way‚Äîthey are entangled to produce one another. The association of spiritual warfare with a rise in militarization serves to contextualize some of the ways that prayer warriors create meanings around their own actions and tactics, as well as around those they are trying to criticize or change. \\"Spiritual battles\\" and \\"prayer strikes\\" on the \\"prayer battlefield\\" use highly politicized language to forcefully impose change onto another party or group, piggybacking on the power of militaristic rhetorical function to achieve this aim. Christian countercult movement The excesses of allegations made in the satanic ritual abuse phenomenon of the 1980s and 1990s have prompted critical reviews; however, these are due to the surreptitious nature of these cases. Some apologists in the Christian countercult movement have expressed concerns that spiritual warfare techniques seem at times to have been based on spurious stories and anecdotes without careful discernment and reflection. Some of these general concerns have been expressed by apologists like Elliot Miller (Christian Research Institute), and Bob and Gretchen Passantino in various articles published in the Christian Research Journal. Others, such as Mike Hertenstein and Jon Trott, have called into question the claims of alleged ex-Satanists like Mike Warnke and Lauren Stratford whose stories have subsequently influenced many popular books about spiritual warfare and the occult. Bill Ellis's work, Raising the Devil, has detected the presence of folkloric stories about the occult and demons circulating in evangelical and charismatic circles, which later become accepted as unquestioned facts. Cultural influence Popular fictional portrayals of spiritual warfare are found in novels by Frank E. Peretti, This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness, and Darrin J Mason, Ominous.

After playing college football with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, he was drafted by the Bills. Shaw was the prototypical \\"pulling guard\\" who despite his size held his own against much bigger defensive linemen like Ernie Ladd, Earl Faison and Buck Buchanan. He won three straight Eastern Division titles and two American Football League championships in 1964 and 1965 with Buffalo. Shaw was a first-team All- American Football League selection four times (1963‚Äì1966) and second team All- AFL in 1968 and 1969. He played in eight American Football League All-Star Games and was named to the All-Time All-AFL Team. He made the All-Decade All- pro football team of the 1960s. Shaw played his entire career in the American Football League, and retired after the 1969 AFL season. Shaw is the only player ever inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame without ever playing in the NFL. (The Bills, along with the rest of the AFL, merged with the NFL the season following his retirement.) He is also a member of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Bills' 50th Anniversary Team.  Early years Shaw participated in sports throughout his entire youth. He played end in high school football at a small school right outside of Vicksburg until the school decided to drop football. His father moved the family into town so Shaw could continue to play football at Carr Central. Weighing in at 188 pounds Shaw played offensive and defensive tackle at Carr his senior year.Horrigan, Joe. \\"An Aw Shucks Guy.\\" Coffin Corner. 21.4 (1999): 3. Web. September 21, 2011. .  College career  Shaw played offense while he was at Georgia Tech. By his senior year, Shaw weighed in at 220 pounds. His senior year, he earned All- American honors as a two-way tackle and was named to the Georgia Tech All-Time Team. ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Shaw once said, ‚Äúl thought I played defense much better than offense, and I still believe most of the honors I received were for my defensive play.‚ÄùHorrigan, Joe. \\"An Aw Shucks Guy.\\" Coffin Corner. 21.4 (1999): 3.

This is when Shaw bagan playing guard. The College All-Star Team that year played the Philadelphia Eagles. \\"I was scared to death,‚Äù Shaw recalled about playing the NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles in the annual All-Star contest. \\"I was up against Ed Khayat, a Mississippi boy who later finished his career with Boston (Patriots).

Shaw played an amazing game, actually knocking the wind out of Eagle linebacker Maxie Baughan. In the 1961 draft, Shaw was drafted in the second round by the Buffalo Bills, and in the 14th round by the, then rival team of the Buffalo Bills, the Dallas Cowboys. ‚ÄúI had been in contact with the Cowboys mostly prior to the Bills getting involved,‚Äù recalled Shaw. ‚ÄúThe Cowboys wanted to play me at linebacker. We had lengthy conversations at that point in time. The Bills wanted to play me at either defensive end or an offensive line position. I really wanted to play on the defensive side of the ball as a defensive end. So that triggered a real interest for me (in the Bills).‚ÄùBrown, Chris. \\"Bills All-Time draft memories: Billy Shaw.\\" Buffalo Bills. Buffalo Bills, March 16, 2010. Web. September 28, 2011. .

Shaw did well at both blocking for the pass and for the run. With Bills' running backs tending to be more durable than fast, Shaw was the perfect guard. He could stay in front of the runners far down field. Shaw was known as \\"the driving force of the offensive unit.\\"\\"Billy Shaw.\\" Professional Football Hall of Fame.

He represented the Dakota Territory in the U.S. Congress and, after the Dakotas were admitted as States, he was the first U.S. Senator from South Dakota. Early life and education Pettigrew was born to Andrew Jr. Pettigrew and Hannah B. Sawtelle on July 23, 1848 in Ludlow, Windsor County, Vermont, in the residences of his grandparents, parents, sevens siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins. He was the sixth child produced out of nine total. Pettigrew's siblings include: Hannah M., Alma Jane, Henrietta Adelaide, Luella Belle, Justin A., Frederick (Fred) Wallace, Elizabeth Medora (1855), Harlan Page (1862). In 1853 Andrew Jr. sold his store to the partnership of Emerson and Richards, and the family moved Wisconsin in 1854 while Pettigrew was 6 years old. Andrew Jr. moved the family because of his neighbors tough anti-slavery beliefs, the store was used for the circulation of anti-slavery literature. Unfortunately, the store was boycotted by angry, pro-slavers who threatened the Pettigrew family with violence. The family settled in Rock County, near Union, Wisconsin.Wayne Fanebust, Echoes of November, p. 6 Pettigrew attended Evansville Academy, in Evansville WI. In 1866, Pettigrew went to Beloit, WI enrolling in Beloit College. In 1868, he was enrolled in Beloit College again. Winter 1868, Pettigrew entered law school at the University of Wisconsin of Madison in Madison, WI. He moved to Dakota Territory in 1869 to work with a United States deputy surveyor. Career in the Dakotas Pettigrew settled in Sioux Falls, where he practiced law and engaged in surveying and real estate. He was a member of the territorial House of Representatives and served on the Territorial council. He was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House, serving from March 4, 1881 to March 3, 1883. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1882, but returned to the territorial council from 1885 to 1889. U.S. Senate When South Dakota was admitted as a state, Pettigrew was elected as South Dakota's first Senator to the United States Senate. He served from November 2, 1889 to March 3, 1901. He introduced a bill to fund the structure, recommending that native Sioux quartzite be used for construction of the state's first Federal building. He was re-elected in 1894, but left the Republican Party on June 17, 1896 to join the Silver Republicans, a faction of the Republican Party that opposed the party's position in support of the monetary gold standard. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1900. Pettigrew was a strong opponent of President William McKinley's attempt to annex the Republic of Hawaii against the wish of its many native residents. In a congressional speech, he stated: > The American flag went up on Hawaii in dishonor; it came down in honor, and > if it goes up again now it will go up in infamy and shame and this > Government will join the robber nations of the world. His speech about Hawaii and annexation were at odds with some of his other views, namely in Federal Indian policy. Pettigrew was a supporter of a bill that sought to unilaterally dissolve tribal governments so as to force them to agree to allotment of their lands. In 1897, he delivered a speech on the Senate floor saying: > \\"There is no question but that the Congress of the United States at one blow > should not only provide that laws passed by those councils, by those > governments, should be approved by the President before they go into force, > but, on the contrary, that the [tribal] governments themselves should be > destroyed; that their power to legislate should be taken away; that their > courts should be ousted and a proper judicial system furnished to those > people. It is our duty to do it.\\"Calling the Five Tribes of Oklahoma > \\"barbarous,\\" the bill was passed and Native self-rule was removed. US > Congressional Report, 1897, version 30, part 1, pg. 736. In the Presidential Election of 1900, while still in the Senate, he was a delegate and a major figure in the national political convention of the Populist Party held in Sioux Falls that convened on May 9, 1900 and lasted three days. The party endorsed William Jennings Bryan as its candidate.Wayne Fanebust, Echoes of November, pp. 332-334 Pettigrew's home in Sioux Falls as it appears today. After his time in the Senate, Pettigrew first practiced law in New York City, but soon returned to Sioux Falls and was active in politics and business until his death in that city. He was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in Sioux Falls. Pettigrew left his home to the city of Sioux Falls in his will. Pettigrew's home is maintained by the city of Sioux Falls to this day. The Pettigrew museum is designed to emulate how a person of Pettigrew's stature would have lived at the turn of the century. The house is filled with antiques from the early 1900s and Pettigrew's personal collection of artifacts. The latter because Pettigrew was an amateur archaeologist. Pettigrew was also instrumental in the founding of many local communities around Sioux Falls, by donating land. Pettigrew and his wife, Bessie, donated land in 1886 to the founding and development of Granite, Iowa in Lyon County. In 1888, he and S.L. Tate both donated more land and were responsible for the founding of South Sioux Falls. He wanted to build a suburb of Sioux Falls to the south and west. Announced January 12, 2009, Richard F. Pettigrew Elementary School will open fall of 2009 in southwest Sioux Falls. Pettigrew indictment In 1917, while being interviewed by a journalist from the Argus Leader, Pettigrew offered his opinion that the First World War was a capitalist scheme intended to further enrich the wealthy, and he urged young men to evade the draft. The local United States Attorney secured a felony indictment of Pettigrew for suspicion of violating the Espionage Act of 1917, the same charge for which Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs was then presently serving a ten-year Federal prison sentence. Pettigrew assembled a high-powered legal defense team headed up by his close personal friend, prominent attorney Clarence Darrow. The trial was repeatedly delayed, and eventually the charge against him was dropped. Pettigrew had the formal document of indictment framed, and prominently displayed in his home next to a framed copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, where it remains to this day as part of the exhibits of the Pettigrew House & Museum.South Dakota Magazine, \\"Pettigrew's Redemption: Might a Sculptor Vindicate Sioux Falls' Forgotten Father?,\\" by John Andrews (September/October 2010 - retrieved on November 13th, 2011).

Biography Early Years Born in Milford Center, Ohio, to Vermont- natives Norman and Sarah Wilson (Parker) Chipman, Norton Chipman's family moved to Iowa when he was young. He graduated from the Cincinnati Law School in 1859, prior to the school's merger with the University of Cincinnati in its present form. Military career Having enlisted in the Union Army's Second Iowa Infantry during the Civil War, Lieutenant Colonel Chipman fought courageously in battle and was nearly mortally wounded and carried off the battlefield, leading his commanders to report him as dead at the Battle of Fort Donelson. Chipman did, in fact, survive and, upon recovery, was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1862. Chipman and fellow Ohioan Ulysses S. Grant fought together in the Battle of Fort Donelson, which became Grant's first major victory. Chipman was later appointed as a member of General Henry W. Halleck's and then Samuel R. Curtis's staff. He later became a member of the Judge Advocate General's staff. Life in the District of Columbia By 1864, he had moved to Washington, D.C., to work at the War Department under Secretary Edwin M. Stanton. Chipman successfully prosecuted Captain Henry Wirz, the commander of the Confederacy's infamous Andersonville prison camp, where almost 13,000 Union soldiers lost their lives.Marvel, William. Andersonville The Last Depot, University of North Carolina Press, 1994. For his cruelties to prisoners of war and eleven homicides, Wirz was hanged in 1865. Chipman published his recollections of the famous Andersonville Trial in his 1911 book, The Tragedy of Andersonville.This was recently republished in a new edition titled The Andersonville Prison Trial: The Trial of Henry Wirz (Alabama Notable Trials Library/Gryphon, 1990), with an introduction by Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz. After the Civil War, Chipman was appointed Secretary of the District of Columbia by President Ulysses S. Grant, and was later elected to Congress as a delegate from the District of Columbia, serving two terms. While adjutant general of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), he received a note from a friend in Cincinnati. The note suggested that the United States mimic the European custom of decorating graves of people who died while serving in the military. Chipman loved the idea, and he decided the day should be late in the spring, in order to make sure mature flowers were available. Because May 31 fell on a Sunday that year, he declared May 30, 1868, to be Decoration Day, a day to decorate the graves of fallen soldiers from the Civil War. The Associated Press published the order around the country. Decoration Day later became Memorial Day. This myth that Chipman initiated the order creating Memorial Day appears to originate from the 1889 History of the Grand Army of the Republic by Robert Burns Beath, published three years after General John A. Logan‚Äôs death. It is one of many hoaxes deemed apocryphal by Bellware and Gardiner in The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America. In their book, Bellware and Gardiner note that Logan spoke to a group of veterans on July 4, 1866, mentioning the various Southern tributes that occurred that Spring. No one, including Mrs. Logan, Martha Kimball or Norton Chipman (who each claimed to have originated the idea) had to inform Logan about these tributes in 1868, as he became well aware of them two years earlier. Beath actually implies that this order was, instead, an adoption of a Southern custom as the holiday was ‚Äúgenerally observed ‚Ä¶ in the Southern states.‚Äù As Adjutant General, Chipman‚Äôs name appeared along with Logan, the GAR's Commander-in-Chief, on his famous 1868 Order No. 11 published in newspapers across the country. However, Logan never credited Chipman or any of the others with originating the idea. Bellware and Gardiner credit Mary Ann Williams and the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia as the true originators of the holiday as abundant contemporaneous evidence from across the nation exists to substantiate the claim. When Grant was elected president in 1868, Chipman was asked to be on the presidential inaugural committee. At the time, Chipman was living on the corner of First and B streets southeast. After Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, Chipman was appointed Secretary of the District of Columbia, effectively the second highest local official after the Governor of the District of Columbia. Chipman held this position for 50 days, until Edward L. Stanton was appointed to replace him. At the time, Chipman was living at 1725 G Street NW, and he had recently founded the law firm of Chipman, Hosmer & Co., located at Sixth and F streets NW. Chipman spoke at a Republican nominating convention on March 7, 1871, where he said, \\"If there was anybody here who didn't want his children placed in mixed schools he had better take them out of the District of Columbia.\\" The statement was drawn out of Chipman after persistent questioning from someone in the crowd, and it caused quite a stir, considering that Republicans generally avoided committing on the subject of school integration in order to not alienate moderate white Republicans. Due to his friendship with Grant, name recognition, longer residency in the District, and his connection to the District's government, the convention decided to nominate Chipman over Frederick Douglass to be the Republican nominee for the District of Columbia's first delegate to Congress. While campaigning, Republicans advocated for long-time District resident Chipman over Democratic candidate Richard T. Merrick, who they said owned no property in the District. This argument backfired when it was revealed that Chipman had sold his home and was living at a hotel, while Merrick actually did own real estate in the District. During the April general election, Chipman won, receiving 15,196 votes to Merrick's 11,104. Republicans won fifteen of the twenty-two members of the District's House of Delegates as well. Now living on B Street SE, Chipman spent much of his time in Congress advocating for the District's public works program. Among the bills he submitted to Congress was a bill to appropriate 2,500,000 acres of land to build schools, a bill to appropriate $200,000 to complete construction of the Washington Monument, and a bill to build a new bridge over the Anacostia River, a bill to improve the Washington harbor. When Congressman Robert Roosevelt sharply criticized the District's board of public works, calling it rife with fraud and corruption, Chipman fiercely defended the board, saying Roosevelt's charges were based on willful misinformation and false accounts. Running for reelection in 1873, he defeated Democrat L.G. Hine, formerly of the District's Board of Aldermen, receiving 12,443 votes to Hine's 7,042. In 1874, Chipman submitted a bill to annex Georgetown to the City of Washington and to rename its streets to conform to Washington's street-naming conventions. He also tried to require the federal government to pay the District government property tax for the federal buildings located in the District. In 1875, Congress disestablished the District's territorial government including Chipman's position of delegate. Later Years Chipman moved to Red Bluff, California in 1876, where he served as a member of the California State Board of Trade, eventually becoming its president. He served as a supreme court commissioner in California from 1897 to 1905. Finally, he was appointed by California's governor George Pardee as the first presiding justice of the newly created California Third District Court of Appeal, a position he held from 1906 until 1921, when he resigned due to failing health. He died on February 1, 1924, in San Francisco at the age of 89. He is interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. A small memorial remains in the library of the California Third District Court of Appeal in Sacramento. Chipman is the second longest-serving presiding justice of the court. In April 2006, the Federalist Society of Chipman's alma mater, the University of Cincinnati College of Law, officially honored Chipman, renaming its local chapter the \\"Norton Parker Chipman Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies at the University of Cincinnati College of Law.\\" Personal life Chipman married Mary Isabel Holmes (1846-1919) in 1865 while stationed in St. Louis, Missouri. They had two children: Robert Holmes (1865-1866) and Alice Helen. Quotes Popular culture The story of the Andersonville trial and Chipman's role in bringing Wirz to justice inspired the Emmy Award- winning film The Andersonville Trial (1970), directed by George C. Scott. In the film, William Shatner played the protagonist Chipman (Scott had played the role in the original Broadway production), Richard Basehart played Wirz, and Martin Sheen played a minor supporting role.

He is also a former delegate to the United States House of Representatives and was a candidate for the 1972 and 1976 Democratic presidential nominations as a favorite son, as well as a human rights activist. His stated life work is to advocate public policy that \\"declares Good News to the poor, that binds up the broken hearted and sets at liberty them that are bound\\" in the United States and around the world. Biography Early life and education The fourth of seven children, Walter Fauntroy was born and raised in Washington, D.C.. His mother, Ethel (Vines) Fauntroy, was a homemaker. His father, William Thomas Fauntroy, Sr., was a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office. Walter grew up in the Shaw community in Northwest Washington, and attended the New Bethel Baptist Church just a few blocks from his home. He graduated second in his class at Washington's all-black Dunbar High School in 1951, and the members of his church held fund-raising dinners to provide him with a college scholarship. When he graduated from Dunbar in 1952, his church gave him enough money to pay for his first year at Virginia Union University in Richmond. He pledged Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity while at Virginia Union, from where he graduated with honors in 1955, and then earned a degree in divinity from Yale in 1958. Civil rights leader During his stay at Virginia Union University, Fauntroy met the 22-year-old Martin Luther King Jr., himself an ordained Baptist minister. With much in common, the two men formed a friendship that began with an all-night discussion of theology. Fauntroy joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and upon his return to Washington, D.C., became an influential lobbyist for civil rights in Congress. Fauntroy also helped to coordinate the 1963 March on Washington at which King gave his famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. After completing his education, Fauntroy became pastor of the New Bethel Baptist Church. He returned home with an unorthodox view of Christian service that his parishioners immediately embraced. Believing that religion was something more than a Sunday morning pastime, Fauntroy took part in civil rights demonstrations, sit-ins, and marches ‚Äì both in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. As director of the Washington Bureau of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Fauntroy served as D.C. Coordinator of the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and a coordinator for the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches and the 1966 March Against Fear. President Lyndon Johnson appointed him Vice Chairman of the White House Conference on Civil Rights in 1966 and Vice Chairman of the D.C. City Council in 1967. Fauntroy also founded and led the Model Inner City Community Organization (MICCO). This organization, which Fauntroy headed until 1971, used federal grants to improve inner city neighborhoods using black architects, city planners, and construction engineers to design and build homes, schools, stores, and other projects in urban Washington. At one time the budget for MICCO was well over $30 million, a community planning and neighborhood development group in Washington, D.C., that established and began to implement the Shaw Urban Renewal Project. Fauntroy played a key role after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., meeting both with President Johnson and with activist Stokely Carmichael during the immediate aftermath. Fauntroy urged people, in person, on TV, and over radio, to adhere to King's policy of nonviolence. He also led a prayer at King's funeral. Because his religious beliefs placed a premium on community service, Fauntroy gravitated toward the political arena. In 1967, he was named vice-chairperson of the Washington City Council, a nine-member body appointed directly by the president of the United States. Fauntroy sat on the city council for two years, resigning when his commitments as director of MICCO began to take all of his time. In March 2010, Fauntroy asked the United States Supreme Court to stop gay marriage from taking place in the District of Columbia, pending a \\"vote by the people\\". Congressional career The District of Columbia had no formal representation in Congress before 1970. That year, President Nixon signed the District of Columbia Delegate Act that gave the District one non-voting delegate to Congress. Fauntroy wanted the job. With the support of his fellow pastors in the city ‚Äì and with appearances by his friend Coretta Scott King ‚Äî he defeated two primary opponents who had both spent twice as much money as he did. Having won the primary by a substantial margin, Fauntroy easily beat Republican John A. Nevius and other candidates, including future D.C. council members Julius Hobson of the D.C. Statehood Party and Douglas E. Moore, who ran as an independent. Fauntroy was sworn in March 23, 1971, becoming the first delegate to represent the citizens of the District of Columbia as a member of the United States House of Representatives in almost 100 years. Although Fauntroy's status in the Congress did not allow him to vote on the House floor, he was allowed a vote in committee and could introduce legislation on any issue. Fauntroy therefore became influential with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) as a liberal with an agenda that included the concerns of inner city residents, the poor, and minorities. Fauntroy's special quest was for home rule ‚Äì and eventually statehood ‚Äì for the District of Columbia. Using his considerable political clout, he oversaw legislation that provided for direct election of a mayor and a city council in Washington by 1973. Fauntroy briefly considered running for mayor of Washington himself but instead decided to stay in Congress. He was returned to his office five times over the ensuing years, sometimes with as much as 85 percent of the vote. In Congress, he was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He chaired the Caucus in 1981 and led the organization in presenting, for the first time, a budget to be debated by the House. The \\"Constructive Alternative Budget\\" was debated on the House floor for two days. He was a member of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, Congressman Fauntroy chaired for six years the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and for four years chaired the Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade and Monetary Policy. He also chaired, for fifteen years, the Bipartisan/Bicameral Task Force on Haiti. Fauntroy authored the Black Leadership Family Plan For the Unity, Survival and Progress of Black People in 1982. The booklet laid out a strategy for Black social, political, and economic development. On Thanksgiving Eve in 1984, Fauntroy along with Randall Robinson and Mary Francis Berry launched the Free South Africa Movement which included their arrest for a sit in at the South African Embassy in Washington, D.C. Presidential campaigns as favorite son During the 1972 Democratic presidential primaries, Fauntroy campaigned in the D.C. primary as a favorite son candidate and won the largely uncontested event with 21,217 (71.78%) votes against 8,343 (28.22%) for unpledged delegates. In the 1976 Democratic presidential primaries, he again participated in the D.C. primary, this time losing to eventual nominee Jimmy Carter; he placed second overall according to some measurements, but received zero delegates at the Democratic convention. Post-congressional career Fauntroy in 1996 Fauntroy stepped down from his seat in Congress in 1990 to run for mayor of Washington, D.C.. He was defeated by Sharon Pratt Kelly, finishing in fifth with 7%. He told the Washington Post: \\"I put together a very careful and thorough plan, but unfortunately that never got over. But I believe that all things work together for the good of those who love the Lord.\\" Indeed, Fauntroy returned to the New Bethel Baptist Church, where he resumed a full-time ministry and rededicated himself to community service. Fauntroy also founded Walter E. Fauntroy & Associates, a consulting firm that provides lobbying services for a variety of clients. The first and biggest client to sign on with Fauntroy was Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). Since 1992, Fauntroy has been lobbying Congress to pass legislation to create an \\"enterprise fund\\" for South Africa. He has been actively encouraging new private U.S. investment in South Africa as well. \\"I'm having a great time,\\" Fauntroy told the Washington Post from his new offices on Connecticut Avenue. \\"The chances are very slim that I would run for local office in the District.\\" He is president of the National Black Leadership Roundtable (NBLR), the national network vehicle of the Congressional Black Caucus that he founded in 1977. In that capacity, as a part of the NBLR's Seven Point Program, he is co-chair of the Sudan Campaign, chairman of the Business Enterprise Development, LLC and currently heads up a U.S.-based private sector effort to cure extreme poverty in Africa by the year 2025 in pursuit of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The drive is undertaken by the Roundtable in partnership with the Zimbabwe Progress Fund (ZPF) and is known as the Millennium Villages Project. Its focus is upon villages in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2005, along with fellow former African- American Democratic congressman, the Reverend Floyd Flake, he joined with U.S. Representative Walter Jones (R-NC) to support the Houses of Worship Freedom of Speech Restoration Act (H.R. 235), which would have allowed tax-exempt religious institutions to engage more directly in current politics.\\"Senators Brownback and Coburn to Join Jones Calling for Freedom of Speech for America's Houses of Worship.\\" Congressman Walter B. Jones. March 1, 2005. Retrieved January 3, 2009. Robust and athletic through most of his life, Fauntroy was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1993, treated, and cured. He took his condition public to demystify the illness and to assure those who might be afflicted by it that they could be cured. He and his wife, Dorothy, also adopted an abandoned baby whom they named Melissa Alice. According to an April 25, 2015 Washington Post story, Fauntroy had been out of the country since 2012, and his exact whereabouts were unknown, even to his wife and family. He occasionally phoned from a Dubai number to briefly check on people. But he gave no information on his location or exact details on his current life. On June 23, 2016, the Washington Post reported that U.S. officials had contacted Fauntroy in Ajman, United Arab Emirates and provided assistance in arranging his return to the United States, which was expected to occur in late June or early July 2016. He returned on June 27, 2016, and was arrested at Dulles International Airport on charges related to check fraud. He was released the next day. In September 2016, the bad check charge was dropped once Fauntroy paid back $20,000. In 2018, his financial problems placed him in danger of losing his home. Criticism Legal problems In 1995, Fauntroy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of filing a false disclosure statement in 1989. Fauntroy falsely reported making a $23,887 donation to a Washington church at the end of 1988. In 2012, Fauntroy disappeared and presumably fled the United States after a bench warrant was issued for his arrest in conjunction with allegations he had written a fraudulent check for $55,000. Fauntroy's wife was eventually forced to file for bankruptcy. While his whereabouts were initially unknown to even his family, it was assumed Fauntroy was living somewhere in the Persian Gulf. In 2016, Fauntroy returned to the United States and was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport. He had been hiding in Ajman, the capital of the Emirate of Ajman in the United Arab Emirates. Opposition to gay marriage Fauntroy had publicly opposed gay rights for some time. In 1983, he acted to bar LGBT inclusion in the program of Washington's 20th anniversary observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 March on Washington, although the chief organizer of that march, longtime civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, was an openly gay man. Fauntroy has been criticized by supporters of gay rightsGallagher, Maggie. \\"Hate Speech from Gay Marriage Advocates.\\" August 5, 2001. Retrieved January 3, 2009. for his support in 2001 of the Federal Marriage Amendment.Gallagher, Maggie. \\"Do We Need a Federal Marriage Amendment?.\\" July 16, 2001. Retrieved January 3, 2009. In January 2007, Fauntroy was asked to speak at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Eugene, Oregon. The city's human rights commission, knowing Fauntroy was against gay marriage, decided to withdraw from the event, which caused a firestorm of criticism. Ultimately, the commission rejoined the event. In 2009, Fauntroy, along with six other pastors from Maryland and Washington, D.C., filed suit in D.C. Superior Court attempting to force a referendum to keep the District from recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages.Same-sex marriage battle heads to court, The Washington Post, June 17, 2009. The D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics had blocked the referendum because it is illegal to put on the ballot a referendum on any issue covered by the Human Rights Act. Opposition to the Tea Party Movement Fauntroy views the grassroots conservative Tea Party movement as a racist political group. In an August 26, 2010 article by ABC, Fauntroy said, \\"We are going to take on the barbarism of war, the decadence of racism, and the scourge of poverty, that the Ku Klux ‚Äì I meant to say the Tea Party,\\" Fauntroy told a news conference today at the National Press Club. \\"You all forgive me, but I ‚Äì you have to use them interchangeably.\\" 2011 Libyan civil war Fauntroy visited Libya on a \\"peace mission\\" during the 2011 Libyan civil war. He remained there through the invasion of Tripoli, amongst the journalists holed up at the Rixos Al Nasr, where all Western media was based; this fact was confirmed by CNN reporter Matthew Chance on August 23, 2011, who noted on Twitter that Fauntroy was among the journalists being held within the hotel. He was released with the rest of the foreign nationals on August 25, 2011, and returned to Washington, where he took part in remembrances of the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. In an interview with The Afro in early September, Fauntroy claimed to have witnessed Danish and French special forces soldiers on the ground in Libya, beheading and maiming civilians and rebels alike and placing responsibility for the violence on the Libyans. He also said he believed \\"more than 90 percent of the Libyan people love [Muammar] Gaddafi\\", the Libyan strongman opposed by the rebel movement. He defended Gaddafi and condemned his opponents, including NATO, saying, \\"We believe the true mission of the attacks on Gaddafi is to prevent all efforts by African leaders to stop the recolonization of Africa.\\" The Afro noted that it was unable to confirm any aspects of Fauntroy's story, and there has been no independent corroboration of his claims. Personal life He is married to the former Dorothy Simms of Petersburg, Virginia. They have two children: Marvin Keith and Melissa Alice. Awards and honors In recognition of his distinguished record of humanitarian service, both his alma maters, Virginia Union University and Yale University, have conferred honorary Doctor of Law Degrees. He also holds honorary degrees from Howard University and Georgetown University Law Center. The National Urban Coalition granted Fauntroy the Hubert H. Humphrey Humanitarian Award from National Urban Coalition in 1984.

As a non-voting member, Norton may serve on committees, introduce legislation, as well as speak on the House floor; however, she is not permitted to vote on the final passage of any legislation. She is a member of the Democratic Party.  Early life and education  Eleanor K. Holmes in 1955Eleanor K. Holmes was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Vela (n√©e Lynch), a schoolteacher, and Coleman Holmes, a civil servant. While a student at Dunbar High School she was elected junior class president and was a member of the National Honor Society. She attended Antioch College (B.A. 1960), Yale University (M.A. in American Studies 1963) and Yale Law School (LL.B 1964). While in college and graduate school, she was active in the civil rights movement and an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. By the time she graduated from Antioch, she had already been arrested for organizing and participating in sit-ins in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Ohio. While in law school, she traveled to Mississippi for the Mississippi Freedom Summer and worked with civil rights stalwarts such as Medgar Evers. Her first encounter with a recently released but physically beaten Fannie Lou Hamer forced her to bear witness to the intensity of violence and Jim Crow repression in the South.Voices of the Civil Rights Movement Her time with the SNCC inspired her lifelong commitment to social activism and her budding sense of feminism. She contributed the piece \\"For Sadie and Maud\\" to the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan. Norton was on the founding advisory board of the Women's Rights Law Reporter (founded 1970), the first legal periodical in the United States to focus exclusively on the field of women's rights law. In the early 1970s, Norton was a signer of the Black Woman's Manifesto, a classic document of the Black feminist movement.  Career before Congress  Eleanor Holmes Norton as chair of the EEOC Upon graduation from law school, she worked as a law clerk to Federal District Court Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. In 1965, she became the assistant legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, a position she held until 1970. In 1970, Norton represented sixty female employees of Newsweek who had filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that Newsweek had a policy of only allowing men to be reporters. The women won, and Newsweek agreed to allow women to be reporters. Holmes Norton specialized in freedom of speech cases, and her work included winning a Supreme Court case on behalf of the National States' Rights Party, a victory she put into perspective in an interview with one of the District of Columbia Bar's website editors: \\"I defended the First Amendment, and you seldom get to defend the First Amendment by defending people you like ... You don't know whether the First Amendment is alive and well until it is tested by people with despicable ideas. And I loved the idea of looking a racist in the face‚Äîremember this was a time when racism was much more alive and well than it is today‚Äîand saying, 'I am your lawyer, sir, what are you going to do about that?'\\" She worked as an adjunct assistant professor at New York University Law School from 1970 to 1971. In 1970, Mayor John Lindsay appointed her as the head of the New York City Human Rights Commission, and she held the first hearings in the country on discrimination against women. Prominent feminists from throughout the country came to New York City to testify, while Norton used the platform as a means of raising public awareness about the application of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to women and sex discrimination. Appointed by President Jimmy Carter as the first female chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1977, Norton released the EEOC's first set of regulations outlining what constituted sexual harassment and declaring that sexual harassment was indeed a form of sexual discrimination that violated federal civil rights laws. She has also served as a senior fellow of the Urban Institute. Norton became a professor at Georgetown University Law Center in 1982. During this time, she was a vocal anti-apartheid activist in the U.S., and was a part of the Free South Africa Movement. In 1990, Norton, along with 15 other African American women and one man, formed African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom. She contributed the piece \\"Notes of a Feminist Long Distance Runner\\" to the 2003 anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium, edited by Robin Morgan. She received a Foremother Award for her lifetime of accomplishments from the National Research Center for Women & Families in 2011.  Delegate to Congress  Norton speaking at a 1998 rally against the impeachment of Bill Clinton Jack Kemp, Adrian Fenty, and Norton at D.C. Vote rally on Capitol Hill Norton was elected in 1990 as a Democratic delegate to the House of Representatives and uses the title \\"Congresswoman.\\" She defeated city council member Betty Ann Kane in the primary despite the last-minute revelation that Norton and her husband, both lawyers, had failed to file D.C. income tax returns between 1982 and 1989. The Nortons paid over $80,000 in back taxes and fines. Her campaign manager was Donna Brazile. The delegate position was open because Del. Walter Fauntroy was running for mayor rather than seeking reelection. Norton received 39 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary election, and 59 percent of the vote in the general election. Norton took office on January 3, 1991, and has been reelected every two years since. Delegates to Congress are entitled to sit in the House of Representatives and vote in committee, and to offer amendments in the Committee of the Whole, but are not allowed to take part in legislative floor votes. The district and four U.S. territories‚ÄîGuam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands‚Äîsend delegates to Congress; the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico has the same rights as delegates. William Thomas and the White House Peace Vigil inspired Norton to introduce the Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Conversion Act, which would require the United States to disable and dismantle its nuclear weapons at such time as all other nations possessing nuclear weapons do likewise. Norton has been introducing a version of the bill since 1994. Norton in 2006 Legislation strongly supported by Norton that would grant the District of Columbia a voting representative in the House, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009, was passed by the United States Senate on February 26, 2009. However the legislation stalled in the House and failed to pass prior to the end of the 111th Congress. The legislation proposed in 2009 did not grant Norton the right to vote in the 111th Congress, as she would have had to remain in her elected office of delegate for the duration of her two- year term. In September 2010, the national press criticized Norton after the release of a voice message in which she solicited campaign funds from a lobbyist representing a project that she oversaw. Norton countered that the message was typical of appeals made by all members of Congress, and that the call was made from campaign offices not paid for by taxpayers. In March 2012, the public radio series This American Life featured the voicemail message at the start of a program on lobbying titled \\"Take the Money and Run for Office\\". In May 2012, Norton was blocked from testifying on an anti-abortion bill in her district‚Äîthe second time she has been blocked from speaking about abortion. She insisted that it was a denial of a common courtesy. Representative Jerrold Nadler supported Norton's protest, saying \\"Never in my 20 years as a member of Congress have I seen a colleague treated so contemptuously.\\" In August 2014, after the D.C. Board of Elections voted to put a question about marijuana legalization on the ballot in November 2014, Norton vowed to defend against any congressional attempt to stop the district from voting on the issue and to, if approved, fight any attempt to prevent implementation. She is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus.

Norton said that the bill \\"will improve the quality of data that agencies make available about their spending.\\" *Norton supported the bill \\"To amend the Act entitled An Act to regulate the height of buildings in the District of Columbia to clarify the rules of the District of Columbia regarding human occupancy of penthouses above the top story of the building upon which the penthouse is placed\\" (). The bill would increase the height limit of penthouses in D.C. to 20 feet, allowing for human occupancy. Norton said that \\"this bill is not a mandate directing the city to make any changes to penthouses or to its existing comprehensive plan or local zoning laws more generally.\\"  Appearances  Norton with members of the Council of the District of Columbia in 2007. On July 27, 2006, Norton appeared on the \\"Better Know a District\\" segment of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, in which she spiritedly defended the District of Columbia's claim to being a part of the United States. She also appeared on the joint The Colbert Report/The Daily Show \\"Midterm Midtacular\\" special on November 7, 2006. Norton gave further interviews to Stephen Colbert on March 22, 2007, and April 24, 2007, on the subject of representation in the District of Columbia. On February 12, 2008, Colbert and Norton discussed her status as a superdelegate as well as her support of Barack Obama for president. She appeared once again on February 11, 2009, to discuss D.C. representation and promised Colbert that she would make him an honorary citizen of Washington, D.C., and give him a key to the city, if D.C. citizens were given representation. Colbert in turn gave Norton a \\"TV promise\\" that he would be there should that happen. Norton made a further appearance on Colbert's show on June 25, 2014, where she discussed the impact that African-American Democrats had on incumbent Thad Cochran's primary defeat of Chris McDaniel, a Tea Party candidate, as well as Colbert's final episode among a cadre of past guests. On June 27, 2008, Norton appeared on Democracy Now! to discuss the Supreme Court's ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, which she strongly opposed. On December 5, 2014, Norton appeared on Hannity to discuss the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on which she admitted she did not read the evidence of the case, but criticized the racial profiling of young African Americans. Legislation regarding NFL tax- exempt status On October 2, 2014, ABC News reported that Holmes Norton, discussing her co-sponsorship of a bill aimed at changing the National Football League's tax-exempt status, stated: \\"The NFL greed is so widespread that they've chosen to operate as a tax-exempt organization. So we want to take that choice away from them unless, and until, they decide not to profit from a name that has now officially been declared a racial slur.\\" In essence, Holmes Norton's position was that until the NFL forced the Washington Redskins owner (Daniel Marc Snyder) to change the team name she would support legislation that would change the NFL's tax status thereby costing the league money. In popular culture Eleanor Holmes Norton is portrayed by Joy Bryant in Amazon Video's original series Good Girls Revolt and by Donna Biscoe in the HBO original movie Confirmation. She is featured in the feminist history film She's Beautiful When She's Angry. Personal life Norton was married to Edward Norton, who died in 2014. She has two children, John, and Katherine, who has Down syndrome.

It is rendered in several ways depending on the language, for instance Old Church Slavonic (Old Bulgarian): –¶—£—Å–∞—Ä—å–≥—Ä–∞–¥—ä; Church Slavonic; –¶–∞—Ä—å–≥—Ä–∞ÃÄ–¥—ä, ; South Slavic languages: Tsarigrad or –¶–∞—Ä–∏–≥—Ä–∞–¥, depending on their alphabets (or Carigrad as an alternative Latin transliteration of Cyrillic); ; ; ; ; also Czargrad and Tzargrad; see: Tsar. Tsargrad is an Old Church Slavonic translation of the Greek ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒª·Ω∂œÇ Œ†œåŒªŒπœÇ. Combining the Slavonic words tsar for \\"Caesar / Emperor\\" and grad for \\"city\\", it stood for \\"the City of the Caesar\\". According to Per Thomsen, the Old Russian form influenced an Old Norse appellation of Constantinople, Miklagard (–úikligar√∞r). Bulgarians also applied the word to Tarnovgrad (Tsarevgrad Tarnov, \\"Imperial City of Tarnov\\"), one of the capitals of the tsars of the Bulgarian Empire, but after the Balkans fell under Ottoman rule, the Bulgarian word has been used exclusively as another name of Constantinople.–°–æ—Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–π –í—Ä–∞—á–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏. –ñ–∏—Ç–∏–µ –∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –≥—Ä–µ—à–Ω–∏—è –°–æ—Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–π. –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1987. –°—Ç—Ä. 55 (An explanatory endnote to Sophronius of Vratsa's autobiography)–ù–∞–π–¥–µ–Ω –ì–µ—Ä–æ–≤. 1895-1904. –†–µ—á–Ω–∏–∫ –Ω–∞ –±–ª—ä–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑–∏–∫.

This belief was the supported by the Russian Orthodox Church and given at least an air of legitimacy by the marriage of Ivan III to Sophia Palaiologina, a relative of the last Byzantine Emperor. It was allegedly an objective of the Tsars to recapture the city, but despite many southern advances and expansion by the empire, this was never realized owing to the Western interference in the Crimean War. As the zeitgeist which spawned the term has faded, the word Tsargrad is now an archaic term in Russian. It is however still used occasionally in Bulgarian, particularly in a historical context. A major traffic artery in Bulgaria's capital Sofia carries the name Tsarigradsko shose (\\"Tsarigrad Road\\"); the road begins as the Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard and continues into the main highway that leads southeast to Istanbul. The name Tsarigrad is also retained in word groups such as tsarigradsko grozde (\\"Tsarigrad grapes\\", meaning \\"gooseberry\\"), the dish tsarigradski kyuftentsa (\\"small Tsarigrad koftas\\") or sayings like \\"One can even get to Tsarigrad by asking\\". In Slovene it is still largely used and often preferred over the official name.Seznam tujih imen v slovenskem jeziku. Geodetska uprava Republike Slovenije. Ljubljana 2001. p. 18. People also understand and sometimes use the name Carigrad in Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. The Romance language Romanian borrowed the term as »öarigrad but it is an archaic usage now.

It was part of the Formula One World Championship from 1999 to 2017 and it was held during these years at the Sepang International Circuit. The first Malaysian Grand Prix was held in 1962 in what is now Singapore. History  Singapore and Shah Alam  The 1962 to 1965 seasons of the original Grand Prix held on the Thomson Road circuit in Singapore is regarded as an earlier precedence of the Malaysian Grand Prix, when Singapore was part of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965. After Singapore seceded from the federation in 1965, the Grand Prix continued until 1973. Between Singapore's departure from the Malaysian federation and the opening of Sepang Circuit, Malaysia hosted a range of other racing categories in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Shah Alam's own circuit between 1968 and 1995 including Formula Libre (1968), Tasman Formula, (1969-1972), Formula Atlantic (1973‚Äì1975), Formula Two (1977) Formula Pacific (1978‚Äì1982) and Formula Brabham (1995).  Sepang International Circuit  As part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. Similar to other of the country's circuits, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace hot days to tropical rain storms. The inaugural Grand Prix at Sepang was held in , and saw Michael Schumacher return to the sport after his absence due to a broken leg sustained at that year's British Grand Prix. Ferrari dominated the race, with Schumacher handing the victory to title-hopeful teammate Eddie Irvine, only for both Ferraris to be disqualified due to a technical irregularity, before later being reinstated. From 2001, the Malaysian Grand Prix moved from the end of the season to the beginning, which has seen some topsy-turvy results as teams and drivers got to grips with their new equipment, with many races heavily influenced by the winners and losers of the scramble for position into the tight double hairpin bend at the first corner. The 2001 event was hit by a heavy rainstorm in the middle of the race which made conditions very difficult. Conditions were so bad that the two Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello spun off almost simultaneously at the same corner. Remarkably, they both recovered to score a Ferrari 1‚Äì2, because for a long time they were nearly 5 seconds faster than anyone else on the field. Elsewhere, the race was even led by Jos Verstappen, surprisingly. However, as the track begun to dry, he fell back to seventh, but his efforts to keep positions were memorable. On 8 April 2007, shortly before the 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix, Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone was quoted as stating that the circuit was getting \\"shabby\\" and \\"a bit tired\\" from the lack of care, describing it as \\"an old house that needs a bit of redecorating\\". He noted that the circuit itself is not the issue, but rather the surrounding environment; rubbish is said to be littered all over the place, potentially damaging the circuit's good reputation when it was opened in 1999. The day before, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had met Ecclestone to discuss an extension of the Formula One contract beyond 2010. While the government had been given an additional extension to host the Grand Prix until 2015, the government was still mulling the offer, as of 23 April 2007. The circuit was given a renewed contract in 2006 to organise the Malaysian Grand Prix for another five years. On 13 February 2008, the management of the Sepang International Circuit announced its aim to become Formula One's second night race from after Singapore, following discussions about buying a floodlighting system. Mokhzani Mahathir, the chairman of the circuit, was quoted as saying that the lights \\"might be custom made for the circuit.\\" However, the organisers ended up settling for a late-afternoon start time. The 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix was held around sunset, starting at 17:00 local time (09:00 UTC). This proved disastrous due to heavy rainfall. The race was red- flagged and ultimately not restarted due to the low light level making it through the clouds. The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points. On 7 April 2017, it was announced that the 2017 race will be the swansong of the Malaysian Grand Prix. The race's contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales. Malaysia's youth and sports minister at the time Khairy Jamaluddin said on Twitter: \\"I think we should stop hosting the F1. At least for a while. Cost too high, returns limited. When we first hosted the F1 it was a big deal. First in Asia outside Japan. Now so many venues. No first mover advantage. Not a novelty.\\" The BBC reported that \\"Malaysia had struggled in recent years to attract a significant crowd, its appeal having been damaged by the more glamorous night-time event on a street track in Singapore.\\" Official names and sponsors *1999‚Äì2010: Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix *2011-2017: Petronas Malaysia Grand Prix Winners of the Malaysian Grand Prix Repeat winners (drivers) A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship. {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - !

She is the first woman ever to serve as Guam's Delegate, the first female Lieutenant Governor of Guam (from 1995 to 2003), the first female candidate for Governor of Guam (in 1990), and the first female Democrat elected to the Legislature of Guam. Her 1990 campaign also made her the first non-Chamorro gubernatorial candidate in Guam. As the wife of Ricardo Bordallo, she was also the First Lady of Guam from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1987. Biography Madeleine Mary Zeien was born on May 31, 1933 in Graceville, Minnesota, to a family of educators who moved to Guam after her father took a job with the Guam Department of Education. She attended St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana, and the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota, where she studied music. In the 1950s and 1960s, Bordallo was a television presenter for KUAM-TV, the NBC affiliate that was the first television station on Guam. Bordallo was married to Ricardo Bordallo, who served as Governor of Guam from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1987. While serving as first lady, she worked to emphasize the arts in the classroom and to increase awareness of the local Chamorro culture. Bordallo's husband, the former governor, committed suicide in 1990 when his appeals were unsuccessful and convictions of witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice would require incarceration in federal prison. Bordallo was the first woman Democrat to be elected to the Guam Legislature, and served five terms as a senator from 1981 to 1982 and again from 1986 to 1994. During the 1988 U.S. presidential election, Bordallo was a member of Guam's uncommitted delegation to the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Bordallo and Carl Gutierrez Bordallo was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Guam in 1990, following the death of her husband. Ping Duenas ran as Bordallo's running mate for lieutenant governor in the 1990 gubernatorial election. In 1994, she ran alongside Carl Gutierrez on the Democratic ticket and was elected Lieutenant Governor of Guam, serving from 1995 to 2002, the first woman in Guam's history to hold this position. In this role, she worked to promote tourism, environmentalism, and island beautification. In 2002, as Bordallo reached her term limit and as Delegate Robert Underwood vacated his seat and attempted to run for governor, she campaigned for and was elected as a Democrat to the House, serving from January 2003 to January 2019, and is the first woman to represent Guam in Congress. She was one of six non-voting delegates to the House of Representatives. While in Congress, she has devoted herself to economic issues and has helped to pass legislation that aids small businesses on Guam. She has also been involved in military and environmental issues. In April 2008, Bordallo apologized after an investigative report by the Pacific Daily News revealed that she and Senator Jesse Lujan both claimed to have degrees on their official biographies and resumes when they had not graduated from college. In August 2018 Bordallo lost her bid for renomination for another term as delegate in the Democratic primary to territorial senator Michael San Nicolas.

Originally, the bill would have included the provisions to create a fund in the U.S. treasury to pay reparation claims to \\"living Guam residents who were raped, injured, interned, or subjected to forced labor or marches, or internment resulting from, or incident to, such occupation and subsequent liberation; and (2) survivors of compensable residents who died in war.\\" This provision, however, was removed from the bill. Bordallo was \\"extremely disappointed\\" by this change and said that she was \\"committed to continuing our fight for war claims for our manamko despite all the obstacles the conservative Republicans continue to raise.\\" The changes were made so that the bill could pass by unanimous consent. Elections In January 2012, Republican Guam Senator Frank Blas Jr. announced he would challenge Bordallo in the upcoming November election for her delegate seat.Kelman, Brett, \\"Blas running for delegate seat,\\" Pacific Daily News, January 5, 2012, http://www.guampdn.com/article/20120105/NEWS01/201050301/Blas-running- delegate-seat?odyssey=tabtopnewstextFrontpage Bordallo defeated Blas in the November general election. She received 19,765 votes (58%) to his 12,995 votes (38%) In May 2012, Yale graduate and former White House intern Karlo Dizon, Democrat, also announced his bid as delegate to Congress. Bordallo defeated Dizon in the primary election, with 73% of the vote. In 2014 she ran for delegate alongside Matthew Pascual Artero in the Democratic primary election. Bordallo defeated Artero in the primary election on August 30, 2014. Republican candidate Margaret McDonald Metcalfe announced that she would challenge Bordallo in the 2014 November election for her delegate seat. In 2016 she was re-elected by the smallest margin, 53% to 47%, since she was first elected when she faced former Governor of Guam Felix Perez Camacho. In the 2018 elections, Bordallo lost the Democratic primary to territorial Senator Michael San Nicolas for the delegate seat in the U.S. House of Representatives by 3.4%.

He passed major legislation for Guam that resolved long standing land disputes with the federal government, brought recognition to Guam's World War II generation and their case for war claims and enhanced local autonomy. Additionally, he built a successful record of bringing in federal funds for military construction, assistance to the government of Guam due to in-migration from surrounding islands and for several education programs. Underwood ensured Guam's inclusion in major legislation such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that brought domestic telephone rates to Pacific territories, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and the bill that established the Department of Homeland Security. He brought recognition to Guam's unique people by lifting the ban on betel nut (pugua) importation into the US Customs Zone, inclusion in the National World War II Memorial, the creation of Chamorro Standard Time (CST) and participation in national commemorative events. As a member of the Hispanic and Asian Pacific American Caucuses, he spoke out for the protection of immigrant rights, educational opportunities and sensitivity to language issues. As chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in the 106th Congress, he led the effort to include Asian Pacific Americans in scholarship programs, was instrumental in the development of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, spoke out against racial profiling and for including Pacific Islanders as a demographic category in federal programs. 2002 gubernatorial campaign Underwood declared his candidacy for the 2002 gubernatorial election and was a candidate in the November 2002 General election.

Early life Ntaryamira was born in the Mageyo zone's commune of Mubimbi, Bujumbura Rural Province, in what was then the Belgian-administered United Nations Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi. He entered school in Bujumbura, but after an abortive Hutu rebellion in 1972, he and thousands of other ethnic Hutus fled the country. Ntaryamira eventually received a degree in agriculture from the National University of Rwanda in Butare in 1982. During this time, he became politically active in socialist movements. He returned to his native country in 1983 to work as an agricultural official. He was briefly a political prisoner of the regime of Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in 1985. Political career In August 1986, he became a founding member and economic policy director of the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in Burundi party (FRODEBU). His party gained power after Burundi's first democratic elections in 1993, ending a long history of rule by the Tutsi minority and the Union for National Progress (UPRONA). The new president, Melchior Ndadaye, appointed Ntaryamira Minister of Agriculture. In October 1993, however, Ndadaye and his two top officials were assassinated, sparking parliamentary deadlock and civil war. Ntaryamira was selected as president on 5 February 1994 as a compromise: He was Hutu but considered a moderate in Ndadaye's tradition; Anatole Kanyenkiko, a UPRONA figure, was made prime minister. Death The respite was brief, as the plane carrying Ntaryamira and Rwandan president Juv√©nal Habyarimana, a fellow Hutu, was shot down on April 6, 1994, by unidentified men while landing at the Rwandan capital of Kigali, killing both. The deaths set off the Rwandan genocide. Two days later, on 8 April, power was passed to Ntaryamira's longtime associate, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the president of the National Assembly.

He served the first Delegate from Guam to the United States House of Representatives from 1973 to 1985. Early life Won Pat was born in Sumay (now Santa Rita), Guam to his father Ignacio Won Pat, an immigrant from China, and his mother Maria Soriano Borja. He had two brothers and one sister, Francisco Won Pat, Vicente Won Pat and Eulalia Won Pat. Political career Won Pat completed his primary education at the Normal School in Hag√•t√±a. He then became a teacher and after teaching for eight years , Won Pat was nominated to the advisory Guam Congress in 1936. Prior to the signing of the Organic Act in 1950 which provided for US citizenship and limited self-government, Guam's citizens were under complete US Navy rule. The pre-Organic Act Guam Congress sat only as an advisory body to the naval governor. It consisted of two houses ‚Äì the House of Council and the House of Assembly. Its members were elected by the people of their districts. Following World War II, Won Pat began to attain influence on the island forming the Guam Commercial Corporation in 1946. Supported by the naval government, he prioritized economic self-sufficiency before achieving citizenship. GCC played a role in the post-war economic boom, but ultimately went bankrupt in 1954. By this time, Won Pat was entrenched in the House of Assembly beginning in 1948 becoming speaker of the Guam Legislature in 1951. After World War II, the drive for American citizenship gained momentum due to the Chamorro‚Äôs loyalty to the United States during the Japanese occupation of Guam. After attaining the role of speaker in the Guam Congress, Won Pat along with naval Governor Carlton Skinner and Francisco B. Leon Guerrero, began work on what would become the Guam Organic Act. Gaining approval in Washington D.C., the act gave the people of Guam American citizenship and the right to establish a civil government. Guam Delegate (1965‚Äì1985) Guam took another step toward self-representation under Won Pat in 1964 when I Mina‚Äô Siete na Liheslaturan Gu√•han/the 7th Guam Legislature created Guam's Washington Office as an elected position. Won Pat lobbied for the post and won it. While in office Won Pat spread awareness to the other state representatives about Guam and the political situation it was in, and increased federal support following his effective lobbying. In his post in Washington, D.C., Won Pat continued the battle to gain representation in Congress and in the process gained many allies. These allies included California Congressman Philip Burton, a member of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. Burton used his influence to gain the support of committee chairman Wayne Aspinall and twenty co- sponsors. Public Law 92-271 was passed on 10 April 1972. The groundbreaking bill gave Guam and the Virgin Islands representation in Congress for two-year terms. Elected officials could now speak on the House floor and introduce new legislation though they could not vote on the floor. On 3 January 1973, Won Pat became the first resident of Guam to take the oath of office as a member of the 93rd Congress. While Won Pat was Guam's delegate to the US Congress his efforts weren't limited to his constituents on Guam. During his tenure as delegate to the U.S. Congress, he was instrumental in helping what are now the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia, comprising the island states of Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, and Yap; the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau achieved more political self governance through the dismantling of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Shortly after World War II, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, not including Guam, was created and administered by the United States. In the 1970s work began to dissolve the Trust Territory as the districts voted to end their trustee status. The last district to gain political independence was Palau in 1994. The Northern Mariana Islands is now a US Commonwealth and its people US citizens. The Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau negotiated Compacts of Free Association with the United States. Consequently, Guam's northern neighbors, all much more recent members of the American family, have the right to determine issues on a local level, including issues such as minimum wage and immigration, whereas the residents of Guam do not. He served six terms, until he was defeated for re-election in 1984 by Republican Ben Blaz. Personal life Won Pat was married to Ana Salas Perez (1912‚Äì1995) in 1932 and they had eight children: Aveline Ploke, Marilyn (1934‚Äì1990), Jacqueline Won Pat, Ellen Chargualaf, Anthony Won Pat, Rosalind Fleet, Mark Won Pat, and Judith Won Pat, who is the former Speaker of the Legislature of Guam (2008‚Äì2017). He is the uncle of Anna May Baleto of Santa Rita, the mother of Christine Baleto. Retirement and death After his 1984 defeat for re- election, Won Pat retired to Sinajana, Guam. He died in Silver Spring, Maryland, on May 1, 1987, of a heart attack. He is interred in the Veterans Cemetery, Piti, Guam. Honors In January 1989, the Guam International Air Terminal was officially named as Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport in his honor.

It gives its name to the Borough of Fareham. It was historically an important manufacturer of bricks, used to build the Royal Albert Hall, and grower of strawberries and other seasonal fruits. Current employers include Fareham Shopping Centre, small-scale manufacturers, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.  History  Cams Hall North Front Archaeological excavations around the old High Street area and the church of St Peter & Paul on high ground over the Wallington Estuary have yielded evidence of settlement on the site contemporary with the Roman occupation. No extensive programme of investigation has been possible due to the historic nature of the buildings in this area. The town has a documented history dating back to the Norman era, when a part of William's army marched up from Fareham Creek before continuing to the Saxon capital of England, Winchester. Sept 2001 Portsmouth News article concerning the Norman Invasion, as reported by the Fareham Meon Rotary Club - \\"....and Fareham Creek was the landing site for 1,000 men whose mission it was to capture the ancient Saxon capital of Winchester.\\" Originally known as Ferneham (hence the name of the entertainment venue Ferneham Hallhttp://www.fareham.gov.uk/town/activities/fernehamhall/ fareham.gov.uk), it was listed in the Domesday Book as having 90 households. The ford of Fareham Creek (at the top of Portsmouth Harbour) was the location of the Bishop of Winchester's mills; the foundations were subsumed in the A27 near the railway viaduct. Commercial activity continued at the port until the 1970s, and continues on a smaller scale. By the beginning of the 20th century, Fareham had developed into a major market town. In the 1960s, Fareham experienced major residential development. By the 1970s, the town had expanded to almost encompass the surrounding villages of Funtley, Titchfield, Catisfield and Portchester. In the late 1990s, a settlement called Whiteley, straddling the boundaries of Fareham Borough and the City of Winchester, was developed to the north of Junction 9 of the M27 motorway. It is predominantly residential, but it includes the extensive Solent Business Park. In 1995 Cams Hall, a derelict Palladian mansion, was restored for office use, while the surrounding Cams Estate was developed as a golf course and modern technology park. Anvil Man at the Henry Cort Sculpture Park Since 1997 Fareham has been the home of the United Kingdom's Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC), based at the National Maritime Operations Centre (NMOC), and responsible for coordinating all Maritime & Coastguard Agency Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters. An urban renewal initiative began in 1999, renovating the town centre and historic buildings to include a new entertainment and shopping complex. It featured a major iron sculpture park installed in 2001 to celebrate the work of influential Lancastrian iron pioneer, Henry Cort, who lived in neighbouring Gosport but who had an iron rolling mill in Funtley (or Fontley), on the outskirts of Fareham. There is a sculpture park and a school named after him, Henry Cort Community College. Arts and culture Fareham is home to Ferneham Hall, a multi purpose venue with a capacity of over 700. The hall opened in 1982 and has hosted live music, theatre shows, comedy, pantomimes and conventions. The Ashcroft Arts Centre, on Osborn Road, has a 150-seat theatre, a gallery, a dance/music studio and a fully licensed bar. It offers a varied programme of events including films, theatre, comedy and workshops. The pedestrianised area of West Street, in the town centre, is home to a permanent exhibition of the work of 12 blacksmith artists celebrating the achievements of Henry Cort, the 18th century ‚Äòman of iron‚Äô who pioneered the iron refining process at Funtley near Fareham. The puddled wrought iron sculptures are themed on Fareham‚Äôs market town history and the exhibition is the largest of its type in Britain.  Education  In 2017 Fareham College was rated by OFSTED as \\"Outstanding\\". Sport and leisure Fareham has a hockey club, which play at Henry Cort Community College. They are currently in the Men's Conference West Division. Fareham enjoy close access to a thriving Tennis Club in nearby Wickham, many of the Club members are Farehamites, https://clubspark.lta.org.uk/WickhamCommunityTennisClub. Fareham has a Non- League football club, Fareham Town F.C., which plays at Cams Alders. It also has a cricket club, Fareham and Crofton, which plays at Bath Lane. The town also has a Rugby Union club, Fareham Heathens, which plays at Cams Alders. There is a competitive swimming club, Fareham Nomads Swimming Club (FNSC), that is affiliated to the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA), ASA South East Region and Hampshire County ASA (HCASA). The Club was formed in 1974 before there was a public swimming pool in Fareham. Due to the lack of a home pool the club took its name because in the early days it led a 'nomadic' existence, using various pools throughout the area for training until 1980 when Fareham Leisure Centre was opened. Since then, the Club has grown considerably and today has a membership of around 250 children, young adults and masters swimmers. Additionally, it also has a tchoukball club based at Fareham Academy called Fareham Rhinos.  Transport  Fareham is well served by road and rail networks. The M27 motorway passes around the northern edge, and is the main traffic artery into and out of the area. It provides easy access to both Portsmouth and Southampton, and from there to London via the M3 and A3(M). The A27 was the original route along the south coast before the building of the M27, and runs from Brighton to Southampton, passing through the centre of Fareham. The A32 passes through Fareham at the Quay Street roundabout, a notorious bottleneck, on its way from Gosport to Wickham and through the Meon Valley to Alton. Fareham was named the most car-dependent town in the UK by the Office for National Statistics in July 2014 with 538.7 cars registered to addresses in the town for every 1,000 residents. telegraph.co.uk Fareham Railway Station Fareham railway station is on the West Coastway Line, with regular services to Portsmouth, Southampton, Brighton, Cardiff and London.

It is a white, granular or crystalline solid, highly soluble in water, producing an alkaline solution. TSP is used as a cleaning agent, builder, lubricant, food additive, stain remover, and degreaser. The item of commerce is often partially hydrated and may range from anhydrous Na3PO4 to the dodecahydrate Na3PO4. Most often found in white powder form, it can also be called trisodium orthophosphate or simply sodium phosphate.  Production  Trisodium phosphate is produced by neutralization of phosphoric acid using sodium carbonate, which produces disodium hydrogen phosphate. The disodium hydrogen phosphate is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form trisodium phosphate and water. : Na2CO3 \\\\+ H3PO4 ‚Üí Na2HPO4 \\\\+ CO2 \\\\+ H2O : Na2HPO4 \\\\+ NaOH ‚Üí Na3PO4 \\\\+ H2O  Uses   Cleaning  Trisodium phosphate was at one time extensively used in formulations for a variety of consumer-grade soaps and detergents, and the most common use for trisodium phosphate has been in cleaning agents. The pH of a 1% solution is 12 (i.e., very basic), and the solution is sufficiently alkaline to saponify grease and oils. In combination with surfactants, TSP is an excellent agent for cleaning everything from laundry to concrete driveways. This versatility and low manufacturing price made TSP the basis for a plethora of cleaning products sold in the mid-20th century. TSP is still sold and used as a cleaning agent, but since the late 1960s, its use has diminished in the United States and many other parts of the world because, like many phosphate-based cleaners, it is known to cause extensive eutrophication of lakes and rivers once it enters a water system.Dishes Still Dirty? Blame Phosphate-Free Detergent, National Public Radio, 15 December 2010 Substitutes are generally not as effective. TSP is commonly used after cleaning a surface with mineral spirits to remove hydrocarbon residues and may be used with household chlorine bleach in the same solution without hazardous reactions. This mixture is particularly effective for removing mildew, but is less effective at removing mold. Although it is still the active ingredient in some toilet bowl-cleaning tablets, TSP is generally not recommended for cleaning bathrooms because it can stain metal fixtures and can damage grout.  Chlorinated trisodium phosphate  With the formula Na3PO4.1/4NaOCl.11H2O the material called chlorinated trisodium phosphate is used as a disinfectant and bleach, like sodium hypochlorite. It is prepared using NaOCl in place of some of the base to neutralize phosphoric acid.Klaus Schr√∂dter, Gerhard Bettermann, Thomas Staffel, Friedrich Wahl, Thomas Klein, Thomas Hofmann \\"Phosphoric Acid and Phosphates\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2008, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  Flux  In the U.S., trisodium phosphate is an approved flux for use in hard soldering joints in medical-grade copper plumbing. The flux is applied as a concentrated water solution and dissolves copper oxides at the temperature used in copper brazing. Residues are water-soluble and can be rinsed out before plumbing is put into service. TSP is used as an ingredient in fluxes designed to deoxygenate nonferrous metals for casting. It can be used in ceramic production to lower the flow point of glazes.  Painting enhancement  TSP is still in common use for the cleaning, degreasing, and deglossing of walls prior to painting. TSP breaks the gloss of oil-based paints and opens the pores of latex-based paint, providing a surface better suited for the adhesion of the subsequent layer.  Food additive  Sodium phosphates including monosodium phosphate, disodium phosphate, and trisodium phosphate are approved as food additives in the EU. They are commonly used as acidity regulators and have the collective E number E339.Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers, Food Standards Agency, 26 November 2010 The United States Food and Drug Administration lists sodium phosphates as generally recognized as safe.21CFR182.1778, Code of Federal Regulations21CFR182.1778, Electronic Code of Federal Regulations  Exercise performance enhancement  Trisodium phosphate has gained a following as a nutritional supplement that can improve certain parameters of exercise performance. The basis of this belief is the fact that phosphate is required for the energy-producing Krebs cycle central to aerobic metabolism. Phosphates are available from a number of other sources that are much milder than TSP. While TSP is not toxic per se, it is severely irritating to gastric mucosa unless used as part of a buffered solution.  Regulation  In the Western world, phosphate usage has declined owing to ecological problems with the damage to lakes and rivers through eutrophication.  TSP substitutes  By the end of the 20th century, many products that formerly contained TSP were manufactured with TSP substitutes, which consist mainly of sodium carbonate along with various admixtures of nonionic surfactants and a limited percentage of sodium phosphates. Products sold as TSP substitutes, containing soda ash and zeolites, are promoted as direct substitutes. However, sodium carbonate is not as strongly basic as trisodium phosphate, making it less effective in demanding applications. Zeolites, which are clay based, are added to laundry detergents as water softening agents and are essentially non-polluting; however, zeolites do not dissolve and can deposit a fine, powdery residue in the wash tub. Cleaning products labeled as TSP may contain other ingredients, with perhaps less than 50% trisodium phosphate.MSDS for Dap TSP cleaner  References  External links *Safety data from IPCS INCHEM *International Chemical Safety Card 1178 Category:Cleaning product components Category:Food additives Category:Phosphates Category:Sodium compounds Category:Photographic chemicals Category:Edible thickening agents Category:E-number additives ","title":"Trisodium phosphate"},{"id":"309621","text":"Harvey LeRoy \\"Lee\\" Atwater (February 27, 1951 ‚Äì March 29, 1991) was an American political consultant and strategist for the Republican Party.

At Newberry, Atwater served as the governor of the South Carolina Student Legislature. He earned a Master of Arts degree in communications from the University of South Carolina in 1977.  Political career  During the 1970s and the 1980 election, Atwater rose to prominence in the South Carolina Republican Party, actively participating in the campaigns of Governor Carroll Campbell and Senator Strom Thurmond. During his years in South Carolina, Atwater became well-known for managing hard-edged campaigns based on emotional wedge issues.  1980 and 1984 elections  President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office on February 24, 1983 Atwater's aggressive tactics were first demonstrated during the 1980 Congressional campaigns. He was a campaign consultant to Republican incumbent Floyd Spence in his campaign for Congress against Democratic nominee Tom Turnipseed. Atwater's tactics in that campaign included push polling in the form of fake surveys by so-called independent pollsters to inform white suburbanites that Turnipseed was a member of the NAACP. He also sent out last-minute letters from Senator Thurmond telling voters that Turnipseed would disarm the United States, and turn it over to liberals and Communists. At a press briefing, Atwater planted a fake reporter who rose and said, \\"We understand that Turnipseed has had psychiatric treatment\\".

Teenage depression and suicide are major problems in the United States, and I believe that my life story offers hope to young people who are suffering with a constant fear of the future\\". After the 1980 election, Atwater went to Washington and became an aide in the Ronald Reagan administration, working under political director Ed Rollins. In 1984, Rollins managed Reagan's re- election campaign, and Atwater became the campaign's deputy director and political director. Rollins mentions Atwater's work several times in his 1996 book Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms.Rollins, Ed (1997) Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms Broadway. . He states that Atwater ran a dirty tricks operation against Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro, including publicizing the fact that Ferraro's parents had been indicted on numbers running in the 1940s. Rollins also described Atwater as \\"ruthless\\", \\"Ollie North in civilian clothes\\", and someone who \\"just had to drive in one more stake\\". Atwater became a senior partner at the political consulting firm of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly the day after the 1984 presidential election.Partners in Political PR Firm Typify Republican New Breed, Thomas B. Edsall, April 7, 1985 During his years in Washington, Atwater became aligned with Vice President George H. W. Bush, who chose Atwater to manage his 1988 presidential campaign.  \\"Southern strategy\\"  As a member of the Reagan administration in 1981, Atwater gave an anonymous interview to political scientist Alexander P. Lamis. Part of the interview was printed in Lamis' book The Two-Party South, then reprinted in Southern Politics in the 1990s with Atwater's name revealed. Bob Herbert reported on the interview in the October 6, 2005, issue of The New York Times. On November 13, 2012, The Nation magazine released a 42-minute audio recording of the interview. James Carter IV, grandson of former president Jimmy Carter, had asked and been granted access to these tapes by Lamis' widow. Atwater talked about the Republican Southern strategy: https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/exclusive-lee-atwaters- infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/ Jeffery Robinson-The Truth About the Confederacy in the United States https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOPGpE- sXh0 Exclusive: Lee Atwater's Infamous 1981 Interview on the Southern Strategy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ Atwater also argued that Reagan did not need to make racial appeals, suggesting that Reagan's issues transcended the racial prism of the \\"Southern Strategy\\": > Atwater: But Reagan did not have to do a southern strategy for two reasons. > Number one, race was not a dominant issue.

W. Bush at Inaugural festivity on January 21, 1989 Atwater's most noteworthy campaign was the 1988 presidential election, when he served as the campaign manager for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush. Atwater performing at the inauguration of George H. W. Bush in 1989 Dukakis supported a felon furlough program originally begun under Republican Governor Francis Sargent in 1972. In 1976, the Massachusetts legislature passed a measure to ban furloughs for first-degree murderers. Governor Dukakis vetoed the bill. Soon afterward, Willie Horton, who was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder for stabbing a boy to death during a robbery, was released on weekend furlough, during which he kidnapped a young couple, tortured the man, and repeatedly raped the woman. Horton then became the centerpiece of Atwater's ad campaign against Dukakis. The issue of furlough for first-degree murderers was originally brought up by Democratic candidate Al Gore during a presidential primary debate. However, Gore never referred specifically to Horton. Dukakis had tried to portray himself as a moderate politician from the liberal state of Massachusetts. The Horton ad campaign only reinforced the public's general opinion that Dukakis was too liberal, which helped Bush overcome Dukakis' 17-percent lead in early public opinion polls, and win both the electoral and popular vote by landslide margins. Although Atwater clearly approved of the use of the Willie Horton issue, the Bush campaign never ran any commercial with Horton's picture; instead they ran a similar but generic ad. The original commercial was produced by Americans for Bush, an independent group managed by Larry McCarthy, and Republicans benefited from the coverage it attracted in the national media. Referring to Dukakis, Atwater declared that he would \\"strip the bark off the little bastard\\" and \\"make Willie Horton his running mate\\". Atwater's challenge was to counter the \\"where was George?\\" campaign slogan Democrats were using as a rallying cry in an effort to create an impression that Bush was a relatively inexperienced and unaccomplished candidate. Furthermore, Bush had critics in the Republican base, who remembered his pro- choice positions in the 1980 primary, and that the harder the campaign pursued Dukakis's liberal positions, the bigger his base turnout would be. During the election, a number of allegations were made in the media about Dukakis' personal life, including the unsubstantiated claim that his wife Kitty had burned a United States flag to protest the Vietnam War, and that Dukakis had been treated for a mental illness. In the film Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story, Robert Novak reveals for the first time that Atwater personally tried, but failed, to get him to spread these mental-health rumors. The 1988 Bush campaign overcame a 17-point deficit in midsummer polls to win 40 states. During that campaign, future President George W. Bush took an office across the hall from Atwater's, where his job was to serve as his father's eyes and ears. Bush wrote in his autobiography, \\"I was an allegiance enforcer and a listening ear.\\"\\"A Future President's Rebirth\\" by Janet Hook, Los Angeles Times July 11, 2004 In her memoir, Barbara Bush said the younger Bush (whom Atwater called \\"Junior\\") and Atwater became \\"great friends.\\"Barbara Bush: A Memoir (1994) p. 338 (paperback edition).  RNC Chairman  After the election, Atwater was named chairman of the Republican National Committee. Shortly after Atwater took over the RNC, Jim Wright, a Democrat, was forced to resign as Speaker of the House and was succeeded by Tom Foley. On the day that Foley officially became speaker, the RNC began circulating a memo to Republican congresspeople and state party chairpeople called \\"Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet\\". The memo compared Foley's voting record with that of openly gay Congressman Barney Frank, with a subtle implication that Foley, too, was gay. It had been crafted by RNC communications director Mark Goodin and by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich. In fact, Gingrich had been attempting to convince several reporters to print it. The memo was harshly condemned by both political parties. Republican Senate leader Bob Dole, for instance, said in a speech in the Senate chamber, \\"This is not politics. This is garbage\\". Atwater initially defended the memo, calling it \\"no big deal\\" and \\"factually accurate\\". However, some days later, he claimed that he had not approved the memo. Under pressure from Bush, Atwater fired Goodin, replacing him with B. Jay Cooper. Following Bush's victory, Atwater focused on organizing a public relations campaign against Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. Atwater viewed Clinton as a serious potential threat to Bush in the 1992 presidential election. At the time of Atwater's illness, he was supporting the bid of Representative Tommy Robinson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to oppose Clinton in the fall. Robinson lost the primary to former Arkla Gas CEO Sheffield Nelson. In 1989, Atwater became a member of the historically black Howard University Board of Trustees. The university gained national attention when students rose up in protest against Atwater's appointment. Student activists disrupted Howard's 122nd anniversary celebrations and eventually occupied the university's administration building. Within days, both Atwater and Howard President James E. Cheek resigned.\\"James E. Cheek, Forceful University President, Dies at 77\\" by Douglas Martin, The New York Times January 21, 2010 Also in 1989, Atwater strongly criticized the candidacy of David Duke for the Louisiana House of Representatives. He said: \\"David Duke is not a Republican as far as I am concerned...He is a pretender, a charlatan, and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he can find to legitimate his views of racial and religious bigotry and intolerance...We repudiate him and his views and we are taking steps to see that he is disenfranchised from our party.\\"  Musical career  In 1988, Atwater and several friends founded a restaurant named Red Hot & Blue in Arlington, Virginia. The restaurant, which has since grown into a chain, served Memphis BBQ and played Memphis blues music in the dining room. Atwater recorded a 1990 album with B.B. King and others on Curb Records, titled Red Hot & Blue. He also performed with Paul Shaffer and his band in an episode of Late Night with David Letterman.Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story transcript, Public Broadcasting Service, director: Stefan Forbes, 2008.  Personal life   Marriage and children  President Ronald Reagan and his wife, First Lady Nancy Reagan in 1984 President George H. W. Bush in 1990 Atwater married Sally Dunbar in 1978. They had three children, Sara Lee, Ashley Page, and Sally Theodosia. His widow ran for Superintendent of Education for South Carolina in 2014. She was endorsed by former President George H.W. Bush.  Illness  On March 5, 1990, Atwater suffered a seizure during a fundraising breakfast for Senator Phil Gramm. Doctors discovered a grade 3 astrocytoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in his right parietal lobe. He underwent interstitial implant radiationthen a new treatmentat Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, followed by conventional radiation therapy at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. The treatment left him paralyzed on his left side, disabled his tone discrimination, and swelled his face and body.Brady, John (December 1, 1996). \\"I'm Still Lee Atwater\\", The Washington Post, retrieved 2010-04-11.  Conversion to Roman Catholicism and repentance  In the months after the severity of his illness became apparent, Atwater said he had converted to Roman Catholicism, through the help of Father John HardonThomas Aquinas College. \\"In Memoriam: Fr. John Hardon, S.J.\\". Accessed 2008-05-23. \\"His converts were many, including Lee Atwater, the feisty chairman of the Republican National Committee, to whom Father Hardon gave last sacraments when he was on his death bed with brain cancer in 1990\\". and, in an act of repentance, Atwater issued a number of public and written letters to individuals to whom he had been opposed during his political career. In a June 28, 1990, letter to Tom Turnipseed, he stated, \\"It is very important to me that I let you know that out of everything that has happened in my career, one of the low points remains the so-called 'jumper cable' episode\\", adding, \\"My illness has taught me something about the nature of humanity, love, brotherhood, and relationships that I never understood, and probably never would have. So, from that standpoint, there is some truth and good in everything.\\" In a February 1991 article for Life, Atwater wrote: In the article Atwater apologized to Michael Dukakis for the \\"naked cruelty\\" of the 1988 presidential election campaign. Ed Rollins stated in the 2008 documentary Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story:  Death  Atwater died on March 29, 1991, from a brain tumor. Funeral services were held at the Trinity Cathedral Church in Atwater's final residence, Columbia, South Carolina. A memorial service was held at the Washington National Cathedral on April 4, 1991.  Legacy  Sidney Blumenthal has speculated that, had Atwater lived, he would have run a stronger re-election campaign for Bush than the President's unsuccessful 1992 effort against Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.Blumenthal, Sidney (October 19, 1992) \\"Atwater's Legacy\\" The New Yorker, \\"The Talk of the Town\\", p. 40.

Born in Sligo, Ireland, he was reportedly educated at Eton College in England. Clark emigrated to the United States in the early 1780s, living with family members in Germantown, Pennsylvania. In 1786, at the invitation of his merchant uncle, Daniel J. Clark, Sr. of Clarksville, Mississippi, he moved to New Orleans in Spanish Louisiana. The younger Clark streaked into the New Orleans economy, conducting at least 64 notarized transactions, mostly the sale of slaves, that year - double the number of transactions ever conducted in New Orleans in a single year before then. However, Clark's only appearance in the 1790s as a major businessman was reflected in his numerous formal protests for debts due him in 1793.New Orleans Notarial Archives, 1780-1799. Although he was a Spanish citizen until the late 1790s, Clark worked assiduously in the interests of the U.S. government, providing first-hand, detailed responses to President Thomas Jefferson's questions on Louisiana.The Territorial Papers of the United States: The Territory of Orleans, Vol. IX, pp. 28-47. Concerned about possible Spanish attempts to hold New Orleans despite the Louisiana Purchase, Clark sent vital military intelligence to Mississippi territorial governor Claiborne and American general Wilkinson, and offered to seize the city for American authorities.Carter, Clarence, ed. The Territorial Papers of the United States: The Territory of Orleans, Vol. IX, pp. 116-119. Washington, DC (1940): Government Printing Office. On the day of Louisiana's annexation, according to a news account, Clark was \\"everywhere and had an eye to everything.\\"National Intelligencer, 23 January 1804, in an article copied from the Louisiana Moniteur. Clark engaged in land speculation, planting, ship- owning, and banking, but delegated most of the day-to-day business of the firm to the prominent merchants Chew & Relf, who usually worked with him as partners. He was appointed a member of the first Legislative Council for the Territory of Orleans, but declined. Clark was elected as the territorial representative to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from December 1, 1806, to March 3, 1809. Clark may have believed Jefferson should have appointed him as territorial governor, rather than William Charles Cole Claiborne, then governor of the Mississippi Territory. However, although Clark may have been popular with some of the Spanish elite, the prominent New Orleans merchant Benjamin Morgan cautioned about Clark: \\"...he is not popular\\" and \\"deficient in dignity of character and sterling veracity...liked by few of the Americans here.\\",Territorial Papers, Vol. IX< p. 9. Claiborne took offense in 1807 at a speech Clark made on the floor of the House of Representatives,Alexander, Elizabeth Urban, Notorious Woman: The Celebrated Case of Myra Clark Gaines, pgs. 115ff, LSU Press, 2004 in which Clark maligned Claiborne's having allegedly favored the militia of free people of color over the white militia. When Clark would not apologize, the two men met in a June 8, 1807, duel on Clark's plantation (currently Houmas House, in Ascension Parish, Louisiana) in the \\"disputed territory\\" under Spanish rule.Territorial Papers of the United States, Vol. IX, The Territory of Orleans, Clarence Carter, ed., Washington (1940) Clark's pistol round struck Claiborne. Claiborne lamented in a June 17, 1807, letter to President Thomas Jefferson, ‚ÄúMy dear sir, I continue confined to my room, and experience considerable pain‚Äîbut the wound now suppurates profusely and my Surgeon gives me reason to believe that in 3 weeks I shall be enabled to walk---I fear however that the warmth of the weather will considerably retard my recovery.‚Äù pgs. 742-744 Perhaps, in part, because of his duel against Governor Claiborne, Clark was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination to Congress in 1808. A local newspaper opined of Clark, \\"...in his manners many complain that there is something forbidding; something that keeps at a distance even those who esteem him most.\\"Louisiana Gazette, 22 March 1808. In the following year, he published a long, well-documented diatribe against General Wilkinson, entitled \\"Proofs of the Corruption of Gen. James Wilkinson, and of his Connexion with Aaron Burr\\", accusing Wilkinson of being a paid Spanish agent while Wilkinson commanded the U.S. military. Subsequent historians have validated Clark's claims. Clark died unexpectedly in New Orleans on 13 August 1813, and is interred in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 His succession, contested by the child of a secret marriage, Myra Clark, became a legal struggle of titanic proportion fought over seventy years.15 Peters, Gaines v.

He was a catalyst in the promotion of Louisiana statehood and helped draft the state's first constitution. He served as the first President of the Louisiana State Senate. He was born in Rez√© (near Nantes), Pays-de-la-Loire, France. He served in the French Navy and was captured by the British in 1760 and taken to England. He escaped on board a West Indian merchantman to Saint-Domingue, from which he emigrated to Spanish Louisiana in 1768. Poydras was a pioneer businessman, trading first as an itinerant merchant before establishing stores in his domicile of Pointe Coupee Parish. He invested in real estate, buying and selling plantations and retaining some major properties for the cultivation of cotton and sugar cane. He built a number of structures during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, including North Bend plantation house, in 1835, on False River, and owned properties in New Orleans. Poydras wrote the first poetry ever published in Louisiana in 1779, in honor of Don Bernardo de G√°lvez's victory over British troops at the Battle of Baton Rouge, popularly said to have been the only battle of the American Revolutionary War fought outside of the Thirteen Colonies. Poydras' reputation was that of an especially indulgent slaveholder. Yet, while on business in Philadelphia in 1795, a major slave rebellion began on his Alma Plantation, spreading to several other area plantations. The conspirators, who evidence shows to have been urged on by white Jacobin-minded immigrants, were quickly apprehended and several were executed. Julien Poydras willed that his slaves and their offspring be freed 25 years after his death, and all were to be provided with annuities in the meantime. Though his heirs supported his wishes, the time of the anticipated manumission (1849) coincided with the growing abolitionist movement. Fearful of its consequences, the Louisiana State Legislature prohibited any manumissions, and Poydras' slaves remained in bondage until Union troops entered Pointe Coupee Parish in connection with the Siege of Port Hudson in 1863 -- an additional 14 years. Poydras served Louisiana as a U.S. Representative during the territorial period and subsequently in the Louisiana State Senate. He served in a number of community offices in Pointe Coupee, including the post of civil commandant (under Spanish rule), justice of the peace, and church warden.Costello, Brian J. The Life, Family and Legacy of Julien Poydras. Baton Rouge: Franklin Press, 2001. After a long and active life, Julien Poydras died on his home plantation near Point Coupee, Louisiana. He was originally interred in Old St. Francis Cemetery. In 1891, his remains were reinterred on the grounds of the Poydras School in New Roads, when the old cemetery caved into the Mississippi River. > OBITUARY of Julien Poydras 1824 , on the 25th of June, at Point Coupee, > Louisiana; JULIEN POYDRAS, esq.

Legacy Among the philanthropic works during his lifetime, Julien Poydras founded the Poydras Asylum in New Orleans, originally a home for elderly and indigent females but now accommodating persons of both genders. One of Julien Poydras's more unusual bequests was for dowries of indigent brides in Pointe Coupee and West Baton Rouge Parishes. Legend attributes Julien's lifelong single status to the inability of his fianc√©e's family to provide the usual dowry in order for them to marry. Although the dowry fund in Pointe Coupee Parish was combined with the educational fund, the dowries continued to be issued on an annual basis at least until 1982 in West Baton Rouge Parish, each year's brides receiving an equal share of the interest accrued on the principal during the year.Dowries Survive in Louisiana Town, 25 March 1982, The New York Times, retrieved 06 December 2015. One of the main streets of the New Orleans Central Business District has been named Poydras ever since Julien Poydras owned property there. There is an elegant residential thoroughfare in New Roads called Poydras. A succession of New Roads Schools were named for the philanthropist: Poydras College, Poydras School of New Roads, Poydras Academy, and Poydras High School. The latter, built in 1924, is now home to the Julien Poydras Museum and Cultural Center, a project of the Pointe Coupee Parish Historical Society.Costello, Brian J. The Life, Family and Legacy of Julien Poydras. Baton Rouge: Franklin Press, 2001. There is also a town in St. Bernard Parish called Poydras. As is often the case with well-known persons, much of what was printed concerning Julien Poydras for nearly two centuries has proven, upon scholarly examination, to be legendary at best. An exhaustive search of primary source materials by one of Louisiana's most prolific historians and authors, Brian J. Costello, resulted in the publication of The Life, Family and Legacy of Julien Poydras in 2001. It remains the principal scholarly work on Poydras. References External links * Eshelman-Lee, Julie.

While a young reporter for The Washington Post in 1972, Bernstein was teamed up with Bob Woodward; the two did much of the original news reporting on the Watergate scandal. These scandals led to numerous government investigations and the eventual resignation of President Richard Nixon. The work of Woodward and Bernstein was called \\"maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time\\" by longtime journalism figure Gene Roberts.Roy J. Harris, Jr., Pulitzer's Gold, 2007, p. 233, Columbia: University of Missouri Press, . Bernstein's career since Watergate has continued to focus on the theme of the use and abuse of power via books and magazine articles. He has also done reporting for television and opinion commentary. He is the author or co-author of six books: All the President's Men, The Final Days, and The Secret Man, with Bob Woodward; His Holiness: John Paul II and the History of Our Time, with ; Loyalties; and A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\\"Carl Bernstein\\". The Huffington Post. Retrieved February 6, 2014. Additionally, he is a regular political commentator on CNN. Early life and career Bernstein was born to a secular Jewish family in Washington, D.C., the son of Sylvia (n√©e Walker) and Alfred Bernstein. Both his parents were civil rights activists and members of the Communist party in the 1940s. He attended Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, where he worked as circulation and exchange manager for the school's newspaper Silver Chips. He began his journalism career at the age of 16 when he became a copyboy for The Washington Star and moved \\"quickly through the ranks.\\" The Star, however, unofficially required a college degree to write for the paper. Because he had dropped out from the University of Maryland (where he was a reporter for the school's independent daily, The Diamondback) and did not intend to finish, Bernstein left in 1965 to become a full-time reporter for the Elizabeth Daily Journal in New Jersey.Shepard, Alicia C. (May 2, 2008). Woodward and Bernstein. Chapter 1, \\"The Up and Comers\\", pp. 1‚Äì29. Wiley Publishing. Retrieved February 6, 2014. While there, he won first prize in New Jersey's press association for investigative reporting, feature writing, and news on a deadline. In 1966, Bernstein left New Jersey and began reporting for The Washington Post, where he covered every aspect of local news and became known as one of the paper's best writing stylists.\\"WATERGATE: Key Players: Carl Bernstein\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved February 6, 2014. Watergate On a Saturday in June 1972, Bernstein was assigned, along with Bob Woodward, to cover a break-in at the Watergate office complex that had occurred earlier the same morning. Five burglars had been caught red-handed in the complex, where the Democratic National Committee had its headquarters; one of them turned out to be an ex- CIA agent who did security work for the Republicans. In the series of stories that followed, Bernstein and Woodward eventually connected the burglars to a massive slush fund and a corrupt attorney general. Bernstein was the first to suspect that President Nixon was involved, and he found a laundered check that linked Nixon to the burglary. Bernstein and Woodward's discoveries led to further investigations of Nixon, and on August 9, 1974, amid hearings by the House Judiciary Committee, Nixon resigned in order to avoid facing impeachment. In 1974, two years after the Watergate burglary and two months before Nixon resigned, Bernstein and Woodward released the book All the President's Men. The book drew upon the notes and research accumulated while writing articles about the scandal for the Post and \\"remained on best-seller lists for six months.\\" In 1975 it was turned into a movie starring Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein and Robert Redford as Woodward which later went on to be nominated in multiple Oscar (including Best Picture nomination), Golden Globe and BAFTA categories. A second book, The Final Days, was published by Bernstein and Woodward in 1976 as a follow-up chronicling Nixon's last days in office.Google Books , accessed September 7, 2011 After Watergate Bernstein left The Washington Post in 1977 and began investigating a secret relationship between the CIA and American media during the Cold War. He spent a year researching the article, which was published as a 25,000-word piece in Rolling Stone magazine. He then began working for ABC News. Between 1980 and 1984, Bernstein was the network's Washington Bureau Chief and then a senior correspondent. In 1982, for ABC's Nightline, Bernstein was the first to report during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon that Ariel Sharon had \\"deceived the cabinet about the real intention of the operation‚Äîto drive the Palestinians out of Lebanon, not (as he had claimed) to merely establish a 25-kilometer security zone north from the border.\\" Two years after leaving ABC News, Bernstein released the book Loyalties: A Son's Memoir, in which he revealed that his parents had been members of the Communist Party of America. The assertion shocked some because even J. Edgar Hoover had tried and been unable to prove that Bernstein's parents had been party members. In 1992, also for Time, Bernstein wrote a cover story publicizing the alliance between Pope John Paul II and President Ronald Reagan. Later, along with Vatican expert Marco Politi, he published a papal biography entitled His Holiness. Bernstein wrote in the 1996 book that the Pope's role in supporting Solidarity in his native Poland, and his geopolitical dexterity combined with enormous spiritual influence, was a principal factor in the downfall of communism in Europe. In 1992, Bernstein wrote a cover story for The New Republic magazine indicting modern journalism for its sensationalism and celebration of gossip over real news. The article was entitled \\"The Idiot Culture\\". Bernstein's biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton, A Woman In Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton, was published by Alfred A. Knopf on June 5, 2007. Knopf had a first printing of 275,000 copies. It appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list for three weeks. A CBS News end-of-year survey of publishing \\"hits and misses\\" included A Woman in Charge in the \\"miss\\" category and implied that its total sales were somewhere in the range of perhaps 55,000‚Äì65,000 copies. Bernstein is a frequent guest and analyst on television news programs, and in 2011 wrote articles for Newsweek/The Daily Beast, comparing Rupert Murdoch's News of the World phone-hacking scandal to Watergate.Newsweek.com , published July 9, 2011 In 2012, Carl Bernstein spoke at a rally of People's Mujahedin of Iran, an opposition Iranian organization that had previously been listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States, reportedly receiving a payment for his speech. Personal life Bernstein has been married three times, first to a fellow reporter at The Washington Post, Carol Honsa; then to writer and director Nora Ephron from 1976 to 1980; and since 2003 to the former model Christine Kuehbeck. During his marriage to Ephron, Bernstein met Margaret Jay, daughter of British Prime Minister James Callaghan and wife of Peter Jay, then UK ambassador to the United States. They had a much-publicized extramarital relationship in 1979. Margaret later became a government minister in her own right. Bernstein and second wife Ephron already had an infant son, Jacob, and she was pregnant with their second son, Max, in 1979 when she learned of her husband's affair with Jay. Ephron delivered Max prematurely after finding out. Ephron was inspired by the events to write the 1983 novel Heartburn, which was made into a 1986 film starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. While single, in the 1980s, Bernstein became known for dating Bianca Jagger, Martha Stewart and Elizabeth Taylor, among others. Portrayals Bernstein was portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the film version of All the President's Men, and by Bruce McCulloch in the 1999 comedy film Dick. Differences between Bernstein and Woodward Although they worked together to report the Watergate scandal to the world, Bernstein and Woodward had very different personalities. Raised in a traditional Republican household, Woodward was very well-educated and has been described as gentle. After graduating from Yale University, he joined the Washington Post; nine months later, he was assigned the Watergate break-in story. On the other hand, Bernstein was born to a Communist Jewish family. He was rebellious, which led to him dropping out of college. He was ten months further along in his career than Woodward when the scandal broke out. They were also different in work styles. Woodward's strength was in investigation, so he focused on investigating the Watergate scandal. He met his Deep Throat source secretly to get as much information as possible. His writing was serious and matter-of-fact. However, Bernstein was the first of the pair to think that the Watergate case could be related to President Richard Nixon. Compared to Woodward, Bernstein was a strong writer, and therefore wrote articles based on Woodward's information from Deep Throat. Due to their different styles, other journalists described them as a perfect team. Alicia Shepard said \\"Carl was the big thinker, and Woodward was the one that [made] sure it got done...[T]hey knew that each of them had strengths that the other didn't, and they relied on one another.\\" After Watergate, they moved in separate directions. Woodward stayed with the Washington Post, and continued writing critical political pieces. From President Bush to President Obama, he investigated and wrote on political issues concerning presidents and their parties. In 2001, he wrote a significant series about 9/11 terror with other journalists, and received his second Pulitzer prize. He is now an associate editor at the Washington Post; his latest book is Rage. Bernstein left the Post and expanded into other areas due to his reputation from the Watergate reportage. He left the Washington Post and joined broadcast news in a high growth period. He worked at ABC, CNN, and CBS as a political commentator, and was a spokesman in various television commercials. Since parting as coworkers in 1976, they have reconnected in recent years to criticize Donald Trump.

History The company was formed in 1979 by Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor, who met as undergraduates at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1979, they discovered Iron Maiden in a London pub and went on to manage the group. They named the record company after the band's song \\"Sanctuary,\\" which was released as a single in 1980, and later included on American pressings as well as the reissued CD version of their 1980 eponymous debut album. Sanctuary Records has historically signed artists with long-term appeal that have had a long career and steady fan base. Between 1989 and 1991, Sanctuary was co-owned by the Zomba Group, whose music publishing arm still held the music of Iron Maiden in 2001.White, Adam. \\"The Untold Saga of the Zomba Group: Clive Calder's Empire is World's Largest Independent Music Firm\\" Billboard 113/18 (5 May 2001) In 1994, the company diversified. Amongst the new media interests included a joint venture with screenwriter and producer, Raymond Thompson, which evolved into the Cloud9 Screen Entertainment Group. Iron Maiden's back catalog was re- issued by Sanctuary in conjunction with Columbia/SME Records in the US in 2002. Kenny Rogers' 1980s back catalog (originally released on RCA Records) was re-issued by Sanctuary's Castle Music label in conjunction with Kenny Rogers' Dreamcatcher Records in the UK. The albums were only available as imports in the US. Rogers' 2003 release \\"Back To The Well\\" was released by Sanctuary in the UK. Mayan Records was an imprint of Sanctuary Records, under which Lordi's UK album The Monster Show was released. 2006 saw Sanctuary's notable twentieth anniversary release of CD86: 48 Tracks from the Birth of Indie Pop, a reissue of the pivotal UK independent compilation C86.Bob Stanley, sleevenotes to CD86 The company incurred significant losses in its 2004 and 2005 fiscal years.

The company partly blamed the loss increase on record release delays, while announcing, in early 2006, a ¬£110m rescue deal. These events, plus pressure from the UK financial and business leaders led to Smallwood becoming merely a general manager of the company, Taylor becoming Chief Executive and former British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling being installed as the new Chairman. On 26 May 2006, Ayling dismissed Taylor, following a review of accounting practices prompted by inquiries from the Financial Reporting Review Panel.BBC News, Sanctuary sacks boss over figures , 26 May 2006, accessed 29 December 2016. The board's publicly stated reason for the dismissal was \\"that certain of the prior year adjustments made in the 2005 accounts should have been presented as a correction of fundamental errors and not as changes in accounting policy\\". Taylor was replaced by Frank Presland, the chief executive of Sanctuary-owned Twenty-First Artists Management. In July 2006, it was reported that MAMA, the management group behind the Kaiser Chiefs and Franz Ferdinand and headed by Mean Fiddler chief Dean James, had bid for the group. This proved unsuccessful, further depressing the share value of the company. In late 2006, Rod Smallwood left the company, taking with him Iron Maiden's management interests. In April 2007 Billboard reported that Sanctuary Records would cease to exist as a new release label in the US that summer, though catalog, licensing, and new media operations would continue. On 15 June 2007 Universal Music Group announced it had reached an agreement to buy Sanctuary Records for ¬£44.5 million.Kate Holton and Chris Wills, \\"Universal agrees to buy struggling Sanctuary\\" , Reuters, 15 June 2007, accessed 16 June 2007 The agreement was completed in October 2007.

However, due to conditions imposed by the European Commission, UMG was required to sell Sanctuary. It was one of the three units of Universal Music, never fully owned by EMI, that were forced to be sold; other such units were Vivendi Entertainment and V2 Records. BMG Rights Management acquired Sanctuary for over ‚Ç¨46 million. In June 2013, BMG agreed to have INgrooves distribute the label's catalogue in North America, while the PIAS Group would handle international rights; however, Black Sabbath's catalogue remained at Universal until March 2014, when BMG took over the band's distribution.

Retrieved 09-10-2018 ; Sotho: Gauteng; Pedi: Gauteng; ; Tsonga: Gauteng/eXilungwini; Ndebele, ; ; ) is one of the nine provinces of South Africa. The name in Sotho-Tswana languages means \\"place of gold\\". Situated in the Highveld, Gauteng is the smallest province in South Africa, accounting for only 1.5% of the land area. Nevertheless, it is highly urbanised, containing the country's largest city, Johannesburg, its administrative capital, Pretoria, and other large areas such as Midrand and Vanderbijlpark. , Gauteng is the most populous province in South Africa with a population of approximately 15 million people according to estimates. Etymology The name Gauteng is derived from the Sotho-Tswana name, meaning \\"gold\\". There was a thriving gold industry in the province following the 1886 discovery of gold in Johannesburg. In Setswana, the name was used for Johannesburg and surrounding areas long before it was adopted in 1994 as the official name of a province. History A snippet of text showing the Sesotho word \\"Gaudeng\\" (modern Gauteng) in Jacottet's A practical method to learn Sesuto: with exercises and a short vocabulary, published in 1906 Gauteng was formed from part of the old Transvaal Province after South Africa's first multiracial elections on 27 April 1994. It was initially named Pretoria‚ÄìWitwatersrand‚ÄìVereeniging (PWV) and was renamed \\"Gauteng\\" in December 1994. The term \\"PWV\\", describing the region existed long before the establishment of the province, with the \\"V\\" sometimes standing for \\"Vaal Triangle\\" rather than Vereeniging. Gauteng's history has only been properly documented since the 19th century and as a result, not much information regarding its history predating the 19th century is available. At the Sterkfontein caves, some of the oldest fossils of hominids have been discovered, such as Mrs. Ples and Little Foot. The recorded history of the area that is now Gauteng can be traced back to the early 19th century when settlers originating from the Cape Colony defeated chief Mzilikazi and started establishing villages in the area. The city of Pretoria was founded in 1855 as capital of the South African Republic (ZAR - ). After the discovery of gold in 1886, the region became the single largest gold producer in the world and the city of Johannesburg was founded. The older city Pretoria was not subject to the same attention and development. Pretoria grew at a slower rate and was highly regarded due to its role in the Second Boer War. The Cullinan Diamond which is the largest diamond ever mined was mined near Pretoria in a nearby town called Cullinan in the year 1905. Many crucial events happened in present-day Gauteng with regards to the anti-apartheid struggle, such as the Freedom Charter of 1955, Women's March of 1956, Sharpeville massacre of 1960, the Rivonia Trial in 1963 and 1964 and the Soweto Uprising of 1976. Today, the Apartheid Museum stands testament to these struggles in Johannesburg. Law and government The Johannesburg City Hall, home of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature Gauteng is governed by the Gauteng Provincial Legislature, a 73-person unicameral legislature elected by party-list proportional representation. The legislature elects one of its members as Premier of Gauteng to lead the executive, and the Premier appoints an Executive Council of up to 10 members of the legislature to serve as heads of the various government departments. The provincial government is responsible for the topics allocated to it in the national constitution, including such fields as basic education, health, housing, social services, agriculture and environmental protection. The most recent election of the provincial legislature was held on 8 May 2019, and the African National Congress (ANC) won 50.19% of the vote and a 37-seat majority in the legislature. The official opposition is the Democratic Alliance, which won 27.45% of the vote and 20 seats. Other parties represented are the Economic Freedom Fighters with eleven seats and the Freedom Front Plus with three seats. The Inkatha Freedom Party and African Christian Democratic Party hold one seat each. Premier David Makhura of the ANC was re-elected as premier on 22 May 2019, at the first meeting of the legislature after the general election. The Gauteng Division of the High Court of South Africa, which has seats in Pretoria and Johannesburg, is a superior court with general jurisdiction over the province. Johannesburg is also home to the Constitutional Court, South Africa's highest court, and to a branch of the Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court.  Geography  The undulating hills that form part of the rural areas in the province just north of Johannesburg. Although Gauteng is a heavily urbanised province much of its area is extensively cultivated for agriculture. Gauteng's southern border is the Vaal River, which separates it from the Free State. It also borders on North West to the west, Limpopo to the north, and Mpumalanga to the east. Gauteng is the only landlocked province of South Africa without a foreign border. Most of Gauteng is on the Highveld, a high-altitude grassland (circa above sea level). Between Johannesburg and Pretoria there are low parallel ridges and undulating hills, some part of the Magaliesberg Mountains and the Witwatersrand. The north of the province is more subtropical, due to its lower altitude and is mostly dry savanna habitat. Witwatersrand area In the southern half of Gauteng, the Witwatersrand area is an older term describing a 120 km wide oblong-shaped conurbation from Randfontein in the West to Nigel in the East, named after the Witwatersrand, a geologically important series of low hills. This area is also often referred to simply as \\"Witwatersrand\\", \\"the Rand\\" or \\"the Reef\\" (archaic, after the gold reefs that precipitated the development of the area), and was the \\"W\\" in PWV, the initial name for Gauteng. It has traditionally been divided into the three areas of East Rand (governed by the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality), Central Rand (approximately today's Johannesburg Municipality) and West Rand. Climate The climate is mostly influenced by altitude. Even though the province is at a subtropical latitude, the climate is comparatively cooler, especially in Johannesburg, at above sea level (Pretoria is at ). Most precipitation occurs as brief afternoon thunderstorms; however, relative humidity never becomes uncomfortable. Winters are crisp and dry with frost occurring often in the southern areas. Snow is rare, but it has occurred on some occasions in the Johannesburg metropolitan area.

Urban conurbation, The Gauteng City Region (GCR) Previously described as the , the urban conurbation of Gauteng, referred to as the Gauteng City Region,http://www.gcro.ac.za/ contains the major urban populations of Johannesburg (7,860,781 ), Pretoria (1,763,336), Vereeniging (377,922), Evaton (605,504) and Soshanguve (728,063), coming to an urban population of over 11 million. Thomas Brinkhoff lists a \\"Consolidated Urban Area\\" in Gauteng as having a population of 13.1 million . The future governmental plans for the region indicate the gradual urbanisation and consolidation towards the creation of a megalopolis that connects these metros.  The Gauteng City Region Observatory (GCRO)  The GCRO is a collaboration between the Universities of Johannesburg and Witwatersrand, the city of Johannesburg, Gauteng Provincial Government, and SALGA-Gauteng. The GCRO's purpose is to collect information and create a database on the Gauteng City Region to provide to Government, Lawmakers and civil society an informed understanding of the fastest urbanizing region in Southern Africa.  Economy  Gauteng is considered the economic hub of South Africa and contributes heavily in the financial, manufacturing, transport, technology, and telecommunications sectors, among others. It also plays host to a large number of overseas companies requiring a commercial base in and gateway to Africa. Gauteng is home to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Africa. Some of the largest companies in Africa and abroad are based in Gauteng, or have offices and branches there, such as Vodacom, MTN, Neotel, Microsoft South Africa and the largest Porsche Centre in the world. Although Gauteng is the smallest of South Africa's nine provinces‚Äîit covers a mere 1.5% of the country's total land area, the province is responsible for a third of South Africa's gross domestic product (GDP). Gauteng generates about 10% of the total GDP of sub-Saharan Africa and about 7% of total African GDP.List of African countries by GDP (nominal) Transport Sandton Gautrain Station in August 2010 SANRAL, a parastatal, is responsible for the maintenance, development and management of all national road networks in South Africa. SANRAL is responsible for instituting the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, which was met with a lot of opposition due to the tolling of Gauteng motorists. Many important national routes run through Gauteng such as the N1, N3, N4, N12, N14 and the N17. Johannesburg is quite dependent on freeways for transport in and around the city. The R21, R24, R59, M1 and M2 all run through Johannesburg while the R80 connects Pretoria Central to Soshanguve. The Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project led to a large decrease in traffic congestion when construction finished 2011‚Äì2012. Cape Town, for the first time in decades, is now the most congested city in South Africa. PUTCO, the largest commuter bus operator in South Africa, services the Gauteng area extensively. The bus rapid transit system Rea Vaya also serves to transport people from Johannesburg's southern neighbourhoods into and around the CBD. In an interview, Parks Tau stated that by the year 2040, Johannesburg will be dominated by pedestrians and public transport as opposed to the use of private transport or informal transport, such as minibus taxis. Gautrain and Metrorail both service the province's public transport sector where trains are concerned and Gautrain offers a bus service that transports commuters to and from various train stations and predetermined bus stops. Metrorail trains are considered one of the most cost-effective methods of transportation in and around Gauteng. The OR Tambo International Airport, Rand Airport, Lanseria International Airport, Wonderboom Airport and Grand Central Airport are located in Gauteng. There is a large informal transport sector in Gauteng, consisting of thousands of minibus taxis, which many of the urban and rural population makes use of. However, it is noted that taxis are often unsafe as their drivers ignore the rules of the road and the vehicles are often not roadworthy. The City of Johannesburg stated that: \\"major initiatives are under way to completely reform the taxi industry and provide more comfort and safety to customers.\\"  Education  University of Pretoria's Old Arts Building Gauteng is a large center of learning in South Africa, and it has many universities and educational institutions of higher learning. In 2002, the Gauteng Department of Education founded an initiative called Gauteng Online in an attempt to get the entire province to utilize a wide assortment of electronic and telecommunications systems. In 2007, this initiative was handed over to the Gauteng Department of Finance. In the 2013 national budget speech, it was announced that the Gauteng Department of Education would be granted over R700 million to improve education and to alleviate issues concerning the overcrowding in schools, a shortage in teaching staff and transport for poor pupils. In 2017/2018, the Gauteng Provincial government spent R42.4 billion on education which accounted for 38% the province's total expenditure.  Conservation  Although Gauteng province is dominated by the urban areas of Johannesburg and Pretoria, it has several nature reserves. Gauteng is home to the Cradle of Humankind UNESCO World Heritage Site which includes the Sterkfontein caves and the Wonder Cave Kromdraai. Johannesburg is home to the largest man-made urban forest in the world.

Several teams from Gauteng play in the country's top-level association football (more commonly referred to as soccer) league, the Premier Soccer League (PSL), including Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. The national squad Bafana Bafana's home stadium is Soccer City in Johannesburg. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the first ever world cup held by an African nation, Gauteng's stadia hosted many games. The first ever FIFA world cup match on African soil took place at Soccer City on 11 June 2010. Along with Soccer City, Loftus Versfeld Stadium and Ellis Park Stadium hosted matches in Gauteng. Rugby, or more accurately rugby union, is a popular sport in South Africa, and in Gauteng in particular. Two rugby teams from Gauteng participate in the Southern Hemisphere Super Rugby championship: the Pretoria-based Bulls, and the Johannesburg-based Lions (previously the Cats). Three Gauteng-based teams play in the country's domestic competition, the Currie Cup: the Blue Bulls from Pretoria, the Golden Lions from Johannesburg and the Falcons from the East Rand. In 1995, South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup and proceeded to win the tournament at Ellis Park Stadium on 24 June 1995. The events surrounding the world cup formed the basis of the story for the movie Invictus. Many South African universities take part in the Varsity Rugby league. Of these, the Gauteng universities include the University of Pretoria, the University of Johannesburg and the University of the Witwatersrand. Cricket is also widely popular among all cultural groups in the country, and is the only sport to feature in the top two among all of South Africa's major ethnic/racial groups. The Highveld Lions represent both Gauteng and North West in the country's three domestic competitions‚Äîthe first-class SuperSport Series, the List A one-day MTN Domestic Championship and the Twenty20 Standard Bank Pro 20 Series. Many marathons take place in Gauteng, such as the Gauteng Marathon, the Arwyp Medical Centre 15 km Nite Race and the Trisport Joburg City Triathlon. Gauteng's favourable weather conditions throughout the year make it an ideal hub for sports and other out door activities. This makes golf, horse racing and swimming very popular. The Vaal River facilitates water sports in the forms of jet skiing, water skiing and motor boating. Adventure sports are also quite popular in Gauteng, particularly skydiving, paragliding and hang-gliding. The amusement park Gold Reef City is situated in Gauteng, as is the Johannesburg Zoo and the Pretoria Zoo. Botanical gardens in the province include the Pretoria and Walter Sisulu national botanical gardens maintained by the South African National Botanical Institute as well as the Johannesburg and Manie van der Schijff botanical gardens. The Ticketpro Dome and the Gallagher Convention Centre, which are both popular events and expos venues, are also located within Gauteng. The province has also got a F1 racetrack, the Kyalami Circuit. The last F1 race at the venue was in 1993, with a re-make in 2016.

Military forces try to reduce the fog of war through military intelligence and friendly force tracking systems. The term has become commonly used to define uncertainty mechanics in wargames.  Origin  The word \\"fog\\" (), but not the exact phrase, in reference to 'uncertainty in war' was introduced by the Prussian military analyst Carl von Clausewitz in his posthumously published book, Vom Kriege (1832), which appeared in English translation as On War (1873): It has been pointed out that von Clausewitz does not use the exact phrase \\"fog of war,\\" and also uses multiple similar metaphors, such as \\"twilight\\" and \\"moonlight\\", to describe a 'lack of clarity'. The first known use of the exact phrase in text dates to 1896 in a book titled The Fog of War by Sir Lonsdale Augustus Hale, where it is described as, \\"the state of ignorance in which commanders frequently find themselves as regards the real strength and position, not only of their foes, but also of their friends.\\"‚ÄúThe fog of war‚Äù, by Col. Lonsdale Hale, Royal Engineers (retired), Aldershot Military Academy, March 24, 1896.  Military  The fog of war is a reality in all military conflict. Precision and certainty are unattainable goals, but modern military doctrine suggests a trade off of precision and certainty for speed and agility. Militaries employ command and control (C2) systems and doctrine to partially alleviate the fog of war. The term also applies to the experience of individual soldiers in battle: often cited is the pure confusion of direction, location, and perspective on a battlefield. Officers and soldiers become separated, orders become confused and subject to revision with poor communication. Sounds and vision are limited from the perspective of the individual and may not be easily resolved, resulting in a continuing uncertainty, a perceptual \\"fog\\". The fog of war has been decreasing as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technology is improving. In 2016, Chief of Staff of the United States Army Gen. Mark A. Milley stated that \\"On the future battlefield, if you stay in one place longer than two or three hours, you will be dead... With enemy drones and sensors constantly on the hunt for targets, there won‚Äôt even be time for four hours' unbroken sleep.\\"https://breakingdefense.com/2016/10/miserable-disobedient-victorious- gen-milleys-future-us-soldier/  Simulations and games  A block wargame, Richard III by Columbia Games, showing the fog of war in play: the red player can see the identity of their own pieces, but not those of the white player Abstract and military board games sometimes try to capture the effect of the fog of war by hiding the identity of playing pieces, by keeping them face down or turned away from the opposing player (as in Stratego) or covered (as in Squad LeaderSquad Leader Rulebook, 4th Edition, section 25.0.). Other games, such as the Kriegspiel chess-variant, playing pieces could be hidden from the players by using a duplicate, hidden game board. Kriegspiel by Hans L. Bodlaender. Another version of fog of war emulation is used by block wargaming where, much like Stratego, the blocks face each player, hiding their value. However, this also allows for incremental damage, where the block is rotated up to four times to indicate battle damage before the unit is eliminated from the playing field. Solitaire games also by their nature attempt to recreate fog of war using random dice rolls or card draws to determine events. Complex double-blind miniature wargames, including military simulations, may make use of two identical maps or model landscapes, one or more referees providing limited intelligence to the opposing sides, participants in the roles of sub- unit leaders, and the use of radio sets or intercoms.  In video games  In the computer game Freeciv, completely unexplored areas are fully black, while currently unobserved areas are covered in a grey shroud. A computer's ability to effectively hide information from a player is seen as a distinct advantage over board games when simulating war. Fog of war in strategy video games refers to enemy units, and often terrain, being hidden from the player; this is lifted once the area is explored, but the information is often fully or partially re-hidden whenever the player does not have a unit in that area. The earliest use of fog of war was in the 1977 game Empire by Walter Bright. Another early use of fog of war was the 1978 game Tanktics designed by Chris Crawford, which was criticized for its unreliable and \\"confusing\\" fog of war system. Crawford in 1982 suggested \\"limit[ing] the amount of information available to the human player\\" to compensate for the computer's lack of intelligence. In a 1988 Computer Gaming World article Dave Arneson called fog of war \\"one of the biggest 'plus' factors in computer simulations\\", while Crawford concluded, using Tanktics as an example, that video game fog of war systems became less \\"fun\\" the more realistic they were, leading the medium to instead use simplified systems. Two large Blizzard franchises, Warcraft and StarCraft, use a fog of war which only reveals terrain features and enemy units through a player's reconnaissance. Without a unit actively observing, previously revealed areas of the map are subject to a shroud through which only terrain is visible, but changes in enemy units or bases are not. This is also common in both turn-based and real-time strategy games, such as the Close Combat series, Total War series, Age of Empires series, Red Alert series, Advance Wars series, Fire Emblem series and Sid Meier's Civilization series. Fog of war gives players an incentive to uncover a game's world. A compulsion to reveal obscured parts of a map has been described to give a sense of exploring the unknown. Crawford said that \\"reasonable\\" uses of fog of war, such as needing to send out scouts, \\"not only seem natural, but ... add to the realism and excitement of the game\\" Merchant Prince displays over unexplored territory what Computer Gaming World described as a \\"renaissance-style map of dubious accuracy\\". In some strategy games that make use of fog of war, enemy AI can get access to complete visibility of the map, which a player may associate with cheating when discovered. A designer may use fog of war to keep a game that has become impossible to win enjoyable, by hiding this fact from the player.

The Coral Sea extends down the Australian northeast coast. The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, and the United States and Australia. The sea contains numerous islands and reefs, as well as the world's largest reef system, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981. All previous oil exploration projects were terminated at the GBR in 1975, and fishing is restricted in many areas. The reefs and islands of the Coral Sea are particularly rich in birds and aquatic life and are a popular tourist destination, both nationally and internationally. Geography It is bounded in the west by the east coast of Queensland, thereby including the Great Barrier Reef, in the east by Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides) and by New Caledonia, and in the northeast approximately by the southern extremity of the Solomon Islands. In the northwest, it reaches to the south coast of eastern New Guinea, thereby including the Gulf of Papua. It merges with the Tasman Sea in the south, with the Solomon Sea in the north and with the Pacific Ocean in the east. On the west, it is bounded by the mainland coast of Queensland, and in the northwest, it connects with the Arafura Sea through the Torres Strait. The sea is characterised by its warm and stable climate, with frequent rains and tropical cyclones Extent A map of the Coral Sea Islands The Great Dividing Range consists of a complex of mountain ranges, plateaus, upland areas and escarpments. While the Great Barrier Reef with its islands and cays belong to Queensland, most reefs and islets east of it are part of the Coral Sea Islands Territory. In addition, some islands west of and belonging to New Caledonia are also part of the Coral Sea Islands in a geographical sense, such as the Chesterfield Islands and Bellona Reefs. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Coral Sea as follows: > On the North.

Geology The Coral Sea basin was formed between 58 million and 48 million years ago when the Queensland continental shelf was uplifted, forming the Great Dividing Range, and continental blocks subsided at the same time.Hopley, p. 19 The sea has been an important source of coral for the Great Barrier Reef, both during its formation and after sea level lowering.Hopley, p. 27 The geological formation processes are still proceeding, as partly evidenced by the seismic activity. Several hundred earthquakes with the magnitude between 2 and 6 were recorded in the period 1866‚Äì2000 along the Queensland coast and in the Coral Sea.Hopley, pp. 33‚Äì34 On 2 April 2007, the Solomon Islands were struck by a major earthquake followed by a several metres tall tsunami. The epicentre of this magnitude 8.1 earthquake was northwest of Honiara, at a depth of .\\"Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami\\", Breaking Legal News ‚Äì International, 4 March 2007 It was followed by more than 44 aftershocks of a magnitude 5.0 or greater. The resulting tsunami killed at least 52 people and destroyed more than 900 homes.\\"Aid reaches tsunami-hit Solomons\\", BBC News, 2007-04-03 The sea received its name because of its numerous coral formations. They include the GBR, which extends about along the northeast coast of Australia and includes approximately 2,900 individual reefsGreat Barrier Reef, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica on-line and 1000 islands.Hopley, pp. 1, 26 The Chesterfield Islands and Lihou Reef are the largest atolls of the Coral Sea. Hydrology Thermal profile of the East Australian Current Major Coral Sea currents form a counter-clockwise gyro which includes the East Australian Current. It brings warm nutrient-poor waters from the Coral Sea down the east coast of Australia to the cool waters of the Tasman Sea. This current is the strongest along the Australian coasts and transforms 30 million m3/s of water within a flow band of about 100 kilometres wide and 500 metres deep. The current is strongest around February and weakest around August.East Australian Current, NASA The major river flowing into the sea is the Burdekin River, which has its delta southeast of Townsville. Owing to the seasonal and annual variations in occurrence of cyclones and in precipitation (typically between 200 and 1600 mm/year), its annual discharge can vary more than 10 times between the two succeeding years. In particular, in the period 1920‚Äì1999, the average flow rate near the delta was below 1000 m3/s in 1923, 1931, 1939, 1969, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1993 and 1995; it was above 25,000 m3/s in 1927, 1940, 1946, 1950, 1951, 1959, 1968, 1972, 1974 and 1991, and reached about 40,000 m3/s in 1946.Susan B. Marriott, Jan Alexander Floodplains: interdisciplinary approaches, Geological Society, 1999 p. 31 This irregularity results in concomitant fluctuations of the sea water composition near the river delta. The surface water temperature varies on the south of the sea from 19 ¬∞C in August to 24 ¬∞C in February. It is rather warm and stable at 27‚Äì28 ¬∞–° in the north all through the year. Water salinity is 34.5‚Äì35.5‚Ä∞ (parts per thousand). The water is mostly very clear, with the visibility of about 30 metres (100 ft) near the reefs. Climate Tropical Cyclone Larry over the Great Barrier Reef, 19 March 2006 The sea has a subtropical climate and is frequently hit by tropical cyclones, especially between January and April. This range extends to November‚ÄìMay in the areas south to 10¬∞S. Between 1969 and 1997, the GBR experienced 80 cyclones, 90% which were of category 1 or 2 (winds 17‚Äì33 m/s, central pressure 970‚Äì1000 hPa) and only 10% of category 3 (winds >33 m/s, pressure <970 hPa). The cyclone frequency decreased between 1997 and 2005 to 1.5 per year (12 in total).Hopley, p. 96 Annual rainfall typically ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 mm depending on the area. Most rains fall between December and March, in bursts of 30‚Äì60 days. The number of clear days per year varies approximately between 80 and 125, and the typical temperature variation through the year are 18‚Äì27 ¬∞C.Climate Data Online, Australian Bureau of Meteorology Climate change made it 175 times more likely that the surface waters of the Coral Sea would reach the record-breaking temperatures March 2016 that bleached reefs, modeling analysis showed. Winds Winds in the Coral Sea can be classified by season, longitude and latitude. Southeasterly trade winds dominate through all sea areas and all seasons, especially between 20¬∞S and 25¬∞S, west of the meridian of 155¬∞E. However, between September and December they change to northerly and northwesterly winds in this region, and the direction is mostly southwestern in May‚ÄìAugust. West of 155¬∞E, gales are common between January and August and are less frequent in September‚ÄìDecember. In January, the northwest monsoon may occur between the parallels of 15¬∞S and 20¬∞S, west of the 150¬∞E meridian. Gales are rare in this region most of the year except for June‚ÄìAugust, when strong southeasterly winds occur a few days per month. The southeasterly trades are also strong north of 15¬∞S between March and November. They weaken and often change to westerly winds in December and to northerly and northwesterly winds in January and February.Australia‚ÄîCoral Sea‚ÄîIslands and Dangers, p. 131 Flora The Australian shore of the Coral Sea is mostly composed of sand. The GBR is too far away to provide significant coral deposits, but it effectively screens the coast from the ocean waves. As a result, most land vegetation spreads down to the sea,Jonathan D. Sauer Cayman Islands seashore vegetation: a study in comparative biogeography, University of California Press, 1982 pp. 47, 53 and the coastal waters are rich in underwater vegetation, such as green algae.Alan R. Longhurst Ecological Geography of the Sea, Academic Press, 1998 pp. 331‚Äì332 The most common genera of seagrasses are Halophila and Halodule. The islands of the GBR contain more than 2,000 plant species, and three of these are endemic. The northern islands have 300‚Äì350 plant species which tend to be woody, whereas the southern islands have 200 which are more herbaceous; the Whitsunday region is the most diverse, supporting 1,141 species. The plants are spread by birds. Fauna Corals on Flynn Reef near Cairns Crown-of- thorns starfish Christmas tree worm (Spirobranchus giganteus) in Porites coral. Admiralty, Osprey Reef sea krait Laticauda colubrina The sea hosts numerous species of anemones, sponges, worms (e.g. Spirobranchus giganteus shown in the photograph), gastropods, lobsters, crayfish, prawns and crabs. Red algae Lithothamnion and Porolithon colour many coral reefs purple-red and the green alga Halimeda is found throughout the sea. The coastal plants consisting of only about 30‚Äì40 species, and mangroves occur in the northern part of the sea. Four hundred coral species, both hard corals and soft corals inhabit the reefs. The majority of these spawn gametes, breeding in mass spawning events that are triggered by the rising sea temperatures of spring and summer, the lunar cycle, and the diurnal cycle. Reefs in the inner GBR spawn during the week after the full moon in October, while the outer reefs spawn in November and December. Its common soft corals belong to 36 genera. There are more than 1500 fish species in the reef systems.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Coral Sea. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef, including thirteen species of the genus Halimeda, which deposit calcareous mounds up to wide, creating mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover.Hopley, p. 185 Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is the major predator of the reefs, as it preys upon coral polyps by climbing onto them, extruding its stomach over them, and releasing digestive enzymes to absorb the liquefied tissue. An individual adult can eat up to 6 m2 of reef per year. In 2000, an outbreakThe CRC Reef Research Centre defines an outbreak as when there are more than 30 adult starfish in an area of one hectare. of crown-of-thorns starfish contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs. Changes in water quality and overfishing of natural predators, such as the giant Triton, may have contributed to an increase in the number of crown-of-thorns starfish. There are at least 30 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, including the dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, humpback whale and dugongs. Six species of sea turtles breed on the GBR ‚Äì the green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, flatback turtle and the olive ridley. More than 200 species of birds (including 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds) visit, nest or roost on the islands and reefs,Hopley, pp. 450‚Äì451 including the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern. Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the GBR, with 1.4‚Äì1.7 million birds using the sites to breed. Seventeen species of sea snake, including Laticauda colubrinaLaticauda colubrina (SCHNEIDER, 1799), The Reptile Database (pictured), live on the GBR in warm waters up to deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section; none of them are endemic or endangered. The venom of many of these snakes is highly toxic; for example, Aipysurus duboisii is regarded as the world's most venomous sea snake.P. Gopalakrishnakone Sea snake toxinology, NUS Press, 1994, p. 98Harold Heatwole Sea Snakes, UNSW Press, 1999, p. 115Steve Backshall Steve Backshall's venom: poisonous animals in the natural world, New Holland Publishers, 2007, p. 155 There are more than 1,500 fish species, including the clownfish (Amphiprioninae), red bass (Lutjanus bohar), red-throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus), coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and several species of snapper (Lutjanidae). Forty-nine species mass spawn and eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range. With a maximum total length of 0.84 cm (0.33 in), Schindleria brevipinguis, which is native to the GBR and Osprey Reef, is one of the smallest known fish and vertebrate.W. Watson and H.J. Walker Jr, The World‚Äôs Smallest Vertebrate, Schindleria brevipinguis, A New Paedomorphic Species in the Family Schindleriidae (Perciformes: Gobioidei) Records of the Australian Museum (2004) Vol. 56: 139‚Äì142. However, it was claimed later (2006) that Paedocypris progenetica is the smallest fish and vertebrate. There are at least 330 species of ascidians on the reef system with the diameter of . Between 300 and 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef. Saltwater crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast. Around 125 species of shark, stingray, skates or chimaera live on the GBR, in addition to about 5,000 species of mollusc. The latter include the giant clam and various nudibranchs and cone snails. One study of 443 individual sharks gives the following distribution of their species on the Australian side of the Coral Sea: grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, 69%), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus, 21%), silvertip shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus, 10%), tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier, <1%) and great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran, <1%). The interaction rate (free diving) at the Coral Sea reefs ranged from a few to 26 sharks per hour.Australian Underwater Federation. \\"Community monitoring of reef sharks in the Coral Sea and Great Barrier Reef, Australia\\" (2008) The rare Etmopterus dislineatus shark species is endemic to the central part of the Coral Sea. It has been observed at depths of 590‚Äì700 m on or near the continental slope.Deep Sea 2003: conference on the governance and management of deep-sea fisheries, Food & Agriculture Org., 2006 p. 374 Human activities The coastal areas of the Coral Sea were populated at least 40,000 years ago by prehistoric people descending through the northern islands. Those Aboriginal tribes have been dispersed and nowadays only about 70 groups live in the area around the GBR.Traditional Use, Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2009 The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, and the United States and Australia. An example is the wreckage of the USS Lexington found in 2018. Navigation has long been a traditional human activity on the Coral Sea and there are 10 major ports on the Queensland coast alone. More than 3,500 ships operated in this area in 2007, making over 9,700 voyages that transported coal, sugar, iron ore, timber, oil, chemicals, cattle and other goods.Ports and shipping, Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2009 The abundance of coral reefs hinders shipping traffic, and about 50‚Äì60 accidents per year were reported between 1990 and 2007 in the GBR alone. Other economic activities in the sea include fishing and exploration of petroleum deposits in the Gulf of Papua. The sea is also a popular tourism destination. In 2006‚Äì2007, tourism on the GBR contributed A$5.1 billion to the Australian economy.Tourism, Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2009 The tourism is mostly foreign or from remote parts of Australia, with a local contribution of about A$153 million. In particular, about 14.6 million visits were made to the Coral Sea reefs by the Queensland residents over 12 months in 2008.Recreation, Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2009 Growing concerns over the environmental effects of tourism resulted in establishment in 1975 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. There are also smaller state and national parks. In 1981, the Great Barrier Reef was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. From the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the GBR Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission. It was suggested in 1923 that the Great Barrier Reef contains a major oil reservoir. After the Commonwealth Petroleum Search Subsidies Act of 1957, hydrocarbon exploration increased in Queensland, including a well drilled at Wreck Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef in 1959. In the 1960s, drilling for oil and gas was investigated throughout the Great Barrier Reef, in the Torres Strait, along \\"the eastern seaboard of Cape York to Princess Charlotte Bay\\" and along the coast from Cooktown to Fraser Island. In the late 1960s, more exploratory oil wells were drilled near Wreck Island in the Capricorn Channel, and near Darnley Island in the Torres Strait, but with no results. In the 1970s, responding to concern about oil spills, the Australian government forbade petroleum drilling on the GBR. Yet oil spills due to shipping accidents are still a threat to environment, with a total of 282 spills between 1987 and 2002. Shen Neng 1 aground on the Great Barrier Reef on 5 April 2010 Queensland has several major urban centres on the coast including Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Sunshine Coast and the industrial city of Gladstone, which inevitably contaminate the sea. About thirty rivers and hundreds of small streams add continental water, which contains sediments, pesticides and industrial waste. Runoff is especially concerning in the region south of Cairns, as it may receive up to 4200 mm of rain per year. About 90% of sea contamination originates from land farming activities. The area is continuously urbanising, so that the population is expected to increase by 40% by 2026. As a result, 70‚Äì90% of the coastal wetlands has been lost over the past decades, and many remaining flora species are endangered.Coastal development, Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2009 On 3 April 2010, the Chinese ship Shen Neng 1 carrying 950 tonnes of oil, ran aground east of Rockhampton in Central Queensland, Australia, causing the 2010 Great Barrier Reef oil spill and inflicting the largest damage to the GBR and the Coral Sea so far. The scarred area was roughly long and wide, and some parts of it have become completely devoid of marine life. There are concerns that there could be considerable long-term damage and it will take 10 to 20 years for the reef to recover. By 13 April 2010, oil tar balls were washing up on the beaches of North West Island, a significant bird rookery and turtle nesting colony. Protection The Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve was proclaimed in December 2013, but it was not seen to offer enough protection for the environment. A group of 10 environmental NGOs came together as a coalition called the Protect our Coral Sea campaign, asking the government to create a very large highly protected Coral Sea Marine Park. In November 2011 the Australian government announced that a protected area was planned and pending approval. The Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve was renamed as the Coral Sea Marine Park in October 2017. It covers an area of and is assigned IUCN category IV. It is Australia's largest single marine park and is one of the world's largest protected areas. Research Before 2020, only shallow parts of Coral Sea reefs had been mapped. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, some of the deepest parts of the sea were mapped using an advanced multi-beam sonar system aboard a research ship owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, after it was diverted from a Papua New Guinea deployment because of the pandemic. A robotic submarine sent back the first ever high-resolution footage and seafloor mapping of the vital marine protected area connecting the Great Barrier Reef to the Pacific Ocean. An area of was mapped, during 14 dives by the submarine, which went down up to into the depths and spent almost 100 hours in the sea. Geoscientist Jody Webster of the University of Sydney, marine geologist Robin Beaman of James Cook University led the expedition, with colleagues controlling the diving and mapping remotely from their homes, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Rare marine life was identified after the images were shared with other scientists on social media, but researchers think that some of the species captured on film could be entirely new to science. Notable finds included a species of spikefish called Hollardia goslinei, previously only seen in Hawaii, and Tosanoides bennetti, first described in 2019 and never seen alive.

The company is among the three largest chemical producers in the world. Dow manufactures plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products. With a presence in about 160 countries, it employs about 54,000 people worldwide. Dow has been called the \\"chemical companies' chemical company\\" as its sales are to other industries rather than directly to end-use consumers. Dow is a member of the American Chemistry Council. The company tagline is \\"Seek Together\\".https://businesswomen/news/home/20190401005899/en/Dow-completes- separation-DowDuPont In 2017, the company merged into DowDuPont and in April 2019, the company's parent, Dow Inc. was separated into a public company via a corporate spin-off.  Products  Former Dow Chemical Corporate headquarters in Midland, Michigan. Dow is a large producer of plastics, including polystyrene, polyurethane, polyethylene, polypropylene, and synthetic rubber. It is also a major producer of ethylene oxide, various acrylates, surfactants, and cellulose resins. It produces agricultural chemicals including the pesticide Lorsban and consumer products including Styrofoam. Some Dow consumer products including Saran wrap, Ziploc bags and Scrubbing Bubbles were sold to S. C. Johnson & Son in 1997. Performance plastics Performance plastics make up 25% of Dow's sales,Chemical and Engineering News, Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10‚Äì15 with many products designed for the automotive and construction industries. The plastics include polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as polystyrene used to produce Styrofoam insulating material. Dow manufactures epoxy resin intermediates including bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin. Saran resins and films are based on polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) Performance chemicals The Performance Chemicals (17 percent of sales) segment produces chemicals and materials for water purification, pharmaceuticals, paper coatings, paints and advanced electronics. Major product lines include nitroparaffins, such as nitromethane, used in the pharmaceutical industry and manufactured by Angus Chemical Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Co. Important polymers include Dowex ion exchange resins, acrylic and polystyrene latex, as well as Carbowax polyethylene glycols. Specialty chemicals are used as starting materials for production of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Water purification Dow Water and Process Solutions (DW&PS;) is a business unit which manufactures Filmtec reverse osmosis membranes which are used to purify water for human use in the Middle East. The technology was used during the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics. The DW&PS; business unit remained with DowDuPont following the April 2019 spin-off. Agricultural sciences Agricultural Sciences, or (Dow AgroSciences), provides 7 percent of sales and is responsible for a range of insecticides (such as Lorsban), herbicides and fungicides. Seeds from genetically modified plants are also an important area of growth for the company. Dow AgroSciences sells seeds commercially under the following brands: Mycogen (grain corn, silage corn, sunflowers, alfalfa, and sorghum), Atlas (soybean), PhytoGen (cotton) and Hyland Seeds in Canada (corn, soybean, alfalfa, navy beans and wheat). The Dow AgroSciences business unit was spun off into Corteva Inc, on June 3, 2019. Basic plastics Basic plastics (26 percent of sales) end up in everything from diaper liners to beverage bottles and oil tanks. Products are based on the three major polyolefins ‚Äì polystyrene (such as Styron resins), polyethylene and polypropylene. Basic chemicals Basic chemicals (12 percent of sales) are used internally by Dow as raw materials and are also sold worldwide. Markets include dry cleaning, paints and coatings, snow and ice control and the food industry. Major products include ethylene glycol, caustic soda, chlorine, and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM, for making PVC). Ethylene oxide and propylene oxide and the derived alcohols ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are major feedstocks for the manufacture of plastics such as polyurethane and PET. Hydrocarbons and energy The Hydrocarbons and Energy operating segment (13 percent of sales) oversees energy management at Dow. Fuels and oil-based raw materials are also procured. Major feedstocks for Dow are provided by this group, including ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, benzene and styrene. Hand sanitizer In March 2020, during the Coronavirus outbreak, Dow expanded its European hand sanitizer production, providing the product free to hospitals.  History  Early history Founder Herbert Henry Dow Bromine Dow was founded in 1897 by chemist Herbert Henry Dow, who invented a new method of extracting the bromine that was trapped underground in brine at Midland, Michigan. Dow originally sold only bleach and potassium bromide, achieving a bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902. Early in the company's history, a group of British manufacturers tried to drive Dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices. Dow survived by also cutting its prices and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its product line. In 1905, German bromide producers began dumping bromides at low cost in the U.S. in an effort to prevent Dow from expanding its sales of bromides in Europe. Instead of competing directly for market share with the German producers, Dow bought the cheap German-made bromides and shipped them back to Europe. This undercut his German competitors. Even in its early history, Dow set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its product line. Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of agricultural chemicals, elemental chlorine, phenol and other dyestuffs, and magnesium metal. During World War I, Dow Chemical supplied many war materials the United States had previously imported from Germany. Dow produced magnesium for incendiary flares, monochlorobenzene and phenol for explosives, and bromine for medicines and tear gas. By 1918, 90 percent of Dow Chemical production was geared towards the war effort. At this time, Dow created the diamond logo that is still used by the company. After the war, Dow continued research in magnesium, and developed refined automobile pistons that produced more speed and better fuel efficiency. The Dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles, and the 1921 winner of the Indianapolis 500 used the Dowmetal pistons in his vehicle. In the 1930s, Dow began producing plastic resins, which would grow to become one of the corporation's major businesses. Its first plastic products were ethylcellulose, made in 1935, and polystyrene, made in 1937. Diversification and expansion From 1940 to 1941, Dow built its first plant in Freeport, Texas to produce magnesium extracted from seawater rather than underground brine. The Freeport plant is Dow's largest site ‚Äì and the largest integrated chemical manufacturing site in the country. The site grew quickly ‚Äì with power, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production. Growth of this business made Dow a strategic business during World War II, as magnesium became important to manufacture lightweight parts for aircraft.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 118, 219, 312, 324‚Äì5, Random House, New York, NY. . Based on 2002‚Äì2003 data, the Freeport plants produced 27 billion lbs of product ‚Äì or 21% of Dow's global production. In 1942, Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in Sarnia, Ontario to produce styrene for use in styrene-butadiene synthetic rubber. Also during the war, Dow and Corning began their joint venture, Dow Corning, to produce silicones for military and, later, civilian use. The \\"Ethyl-Dow Chemical Co.\\" plant at \\"Kure's Beach\\" NC, the only plant on the East Coast producing bromine from seawater, was attacked by a German U-boat in 1942. In the post-war era, Dow began expanding outside of North America, founding its first overseas subsidiary in Japan in 1952, and in several other nations soon thereafter. Based largely on its growing plastics business, Dow opened a consumer products division beginning with Saran wrap in 1953. Based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses, Dow's sales exceeded $1 billion in 1964, $2 billion in 1971. Nuclear weapons From 1951 to 1975, Dow managed the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, Colorado. Rocky Flats was a nuclear weapons production facility that produced plutonium triggers for hydrogen bombs. Contamination from fires and radioactive waste leakage plagued the facility under Dow's management. In 1957 a fire burned plutonium dust in the facility and sent radioactive particles into the atmosphere. The Department of Energy transferred management of the facility to Rockwell International in 1975. In 1990, nearby residents filed a class action lawsuit against Dow and Rockwell for environmental contamination of the area; the case was settled in 2017 for $375 million. According to the Appellate Court, the owners of the 12,000 properties in the class-action area had not proved that their properties were damaged or they had suffered bodily injury.Cook, et al. v. Rockwell International Corp., et al., Nos. 08‚Äì1224, 08‚Äì1226 and 08-1239 (U.S. Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit Sept. 3, 2010) Vietnam War: napalm and Agent Orange U.S. Army helicopter spraying Agent Orange over agricultural land during the Vietnam War The United States military dropped napalm bombs on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Dow was one of several manufacturers who began producing the napalm B compound under government contract from 1965. After experiencing protests and negative publicity, the other suppliers discontinued manufacturing the product, leaving Dow as the sole provider. The company said that it carefully considered its position, and decided, as a matter of principle, \\"its first obligation was to the government\\".\\"Napalm History\\" Virginia Center for Digital History Despite a boycott of its products by anti-war groups and harassment of recruiters on some college campuses, Dow continued to manufacture napalm B until 1969. The USA continued to drop napalm bombs on North Vietnam until 1973. Agent Orange, a chemical defoliant containing dioxin, was also manufactured by Dow in New Plymouth, New Zealand, and in the United States for use by the British military during the Malayan Emergency and the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. In 2005, a lawsuit was filed by Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange against Dow and Monsanto Co., which also supplied Agent Orange to the military. The lawsuit was dismissed. In 2012, Monsanto agreed to a $93 million settlement as a result of a case pursued by ex-Monsanto employees and citizens in the city of Nitro, WV. In 1949, a chemical plant in Nitro experienced an explosion that damaged a tank containing 2,4,5-T, one of the composites that is used in the production of Agent Orange. The settlement of the case included $9 million for the cleanup of affected homes in the area, and $84 million to cover the medical monitoring and treatment of people affected by the explosion, as well as legal costs for the claimants. Dow Corning breast implants A major manufacturer of silicone breast implants, Dow Corning (Dow Chemical's Joint Venture with Corning Inc.) was sued for personal damages caused by ruptured implants. On October 6, 2005, all such cases pending in the District Court against the company were dismissed. A number of large, independent reviews of the scientific literature, including the Institute of Medicine in the United States, have subsequently found that silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancers or any identifiable systemic disease. Bhopal disaster Dow Chemical banner in Bhopal, India, 2010 Union Carbide became a subsidiary of Dow Chemical in 2001. The Bhopal disaster of 1984 occurred at a pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide India Ltd., a subsidiary of Union Carbide, 17 years before Dow Chemical Co.'s acquisition. A gas cloud containing methyl isocyanate and other chemicals spread to the neighborhoods near the plant where more than half a million people were exposed to it. More than 27 years after the event, the actual number of fatalities is still unknown. The official immediate death toll was 2,259 and the government of Madhya Pradesh has confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. Others estimate 3,000 died within weeks and another 8,000 have since died from gas- related diseases. There are wide variations in the estimated number of individuals permanently disabled by the event. By one independent estimate, 40,000 individuals were left permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness as a result of the disaster. A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. In 2010 eight former executives of Union Carbide India Ltd. were found guilty of death by negligence. Activists sought to have Dow Chemical held responsible for the ongoing cleanup of the site, now under the control of the state government of Madhya Pradesh. DBCP Until the late 1970s, Dow produced DBCP (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), a soil fumigant, and nematicide, sold under the names the Nemagon and Fumazone. Plantation workers who alleged that they became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both Dow and Dole in Latin American courts. The cases were marred by extensive fraud, including the falsification of test results and the recruitment of plaintiffs who had never worked at Dole plantations. While Nicaraguan courts awarded the plaintiffs over $600 million in damages, they have been unable to collect any payment from the companies. A group of plaintiffs then sued in the United States, and, on November 5, 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded them $3.2 million. Dole and Dow vowed to appeal the decision.\\"Dole must pay farmworkers $3.2 million\\", John Spano, Los Angeles Times, November 6, 2007. On April 23, 2009 a Los Angeles judge threw out two cases against Dole and Dow due to fraud and extortion by lawyers in Nicaragua recruiting fraudulent plaintiffs to make claims against the company.Hallman, Ben. ‚Äì \\"Finding Plaintiffs Lawyers Committed Fraud, Judge Dismisses Tort Cases Against Dole and Dow Chemical\\". ‚Äì The American Lawyer. ‚Äì April 27, 2009. The ruling casts doubt on $2 billion in judgments in similar lawsuits.Keating, Gina. ‚Äì \\"Judge throws out Dole \\"bananeros\\" cases, citing fraud\\". ‚Äì Forbes. ‚Äì April 24, 2009. Tax evasion In February 2013 a federal court rejected two tax shelter transactions entered into by Dow that created approximately $1 billion in tax deductions between 1993‚Äì2003. In the stated opinion, the Court termed the transactions \\"schemes that were designed to exploit perceived weaknesses in the tax code and not designed for legitimate business reasons\\". The schemes were created by Goldman Sachs and the law firm of King & Spalding, and involved creating a partnership that Dow operated out of its European headquarters in Switzerland. Dow stated that it had paid all tax assessments with interest. The case was a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service seeking a refund of the taxes paid. The case was appealed to the 5th Circuit court, where Dow's claims were again rejected. Dow has petitioned for an en banc hearing by the 5th Circuit, arguing that the decision was contrary to established case law. Price fixing Dow Chemical was implicated in a price-fixing scheme that inflated the cost of polyurethane for customers. The U.S. Justice Department closed an investigation in 2007, but a class-action lawsuit won at a jury trial in 2013. Dow settled the suit in 2016 for $835 million. Recent mergers, acquisitions and reorganization 1990s ‚Äì transition from geographic alignment to global business units In the early 1990s, Dow embarked on a major structural reorganization. The former reporting hierarchy was geographically based, with the regional president reporting directly to the overall company president and CEO. The new organization combines the same businesses from different sites, irrespective of which region they belong (i.e. the vice president for Polystyrene is now in charge of these plants all over the world).Smith, Richard. \\"Creative destruction: capitalist development and China's environment.\\" New Left Review (1997): 3‚Äì42. Union Carbide merger At the beginning of August 1999, Dow agreed to purchase Union Carbide Corp. (UCC) for $9.3 billion in stock. At the time, the combined company was the second largest chemical company, behind DuPont. This led to protests from some stockholders, who feared that Dow did not disclose potential liabilities related to the Bhopal disaster. William S. Stavropoulos served as president and chief executive officer of Dow from 1995 to 2000, then again from 2002 to 2004. He relinquished his board seat on April 1, 2006, having been a director since 1990 and chairman since 2000. During his first tenure, he led the purchase of UCC which proved controversial, as it was blamed for poor results under his successor as CEO Mike Parker. Parker was dismissed and Stavropoulos returned from retirement to lead Dow.  2006‚Äì2008 restructuring  On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that it planned to close facilities at five locations: *Sarnia, Ontario was Dow's first manufacturing site in Canada, located in the Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a carcinogenic dry cleaning chemical) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as \\"The Blob\\", and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment. Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada's headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three- story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development. Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the Basic Chemicals including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected nearly half of the site's employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space. The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site's workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002. In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas). On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with ethylene through a pipeline from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive. The Low-Density Polyethylene and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the Propylene Oxide Derivatives Unit on April 2009. Dow afterward focused its efforts on the environmental remediation of the vacant site, which was sold to TransAlta. The former site has since been renamed the Bluewater Energy Park, with the River Centre remaining available for lease. *One plant at its site in Barry (South Wales), a triple string STR styrene polymer production unit. Integral in the company's development of the super high melt foam specific polymers & Styron A-Tech high gloss, high impact polymers. *One plant at its site in Porto Marghera (Venice), Italy. *Two plants at its site in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada. On November 2, 2006, Dow and Izolan, the leading Russian producer of polyurethane systems, formed the joint venture Dow-Izolan and built a manufacturing facility in the city of Vladimir. Also in 2006, Dow formed the Business Process Service Center (BPSC). In December 2007, Dow announced a series of moves to revamp the company. A December 4 announcement revealed that Dow planned to exit the automotive sealers business in 2008 or 2009. Within several weeks, Dow also announced the formation of a joint venture, later named K-Dow, with Petrochemical Industries Co. (PIC), a subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. In exchange for $9.5 billion, the agreement included Dow selling 50-percent of its interest in five global businesses: polyethylene, polypropylene and polycarbonate plastics, and ethylenamines and ethanolamines. The agreement was terminated by PIC on December 28, 2008. =Rohm & Haas Co. purchase= On July 10, 2008, Dow agreed to purchase all of the common equity interest of Rohm and Haas Co. for $15.4 billion, which equated to $78 per share. The buyout was financed with equity investments of $3 billion by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and $1 billion by the Kuwait Investment Authority. The purpose of the deal was to move Dow Chemical further into specialty chemicals, which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and are more difficult to enter for the competition. The purchase was criticized by many on Wall Street who believed Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75 percent premium on the previous day's market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from BASF. The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas was closed on April 1, 2009. =Accelerated implementation= On December 8, 2008, Dow announced that due to the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, it would accelerate job cuts resulting from its reorganization. The announced plan included closing 20 facilities, temporarily idling 180 plants, and eliminating 5,000 full-time jobs (about 11 percent of its work-force) and 6,000 contractor positions. =Strategy interruption= Citing the global recession that began in the latter half of 2008, the Kuwaiti government scuttled the K-Dow partnership on December 28, 2008. The collapse of the deal dealt a blow to Dow CEO Andrew Liveris' vision of restructuring the company to make it less cyclical. However, on January 6, 2009 Dow Chemical announced they were in talks with other parties who could be interested in a major joint venture with the company. Dow also announced they that it would be seeking to recover damages related to the failed joint venture from PIC. After the K-Dow deal collapsed, some speculated that the company would not complete the Rohm & Haas transaction, as the cash from the former transaction was expected to fund the latter. The deal was expected to be finalized in early 2009 and was to form one of the nation's largest specialty chemicals firms in the U.S.Dow Chemical to Buy Rohm and Haas, Wall Street Journal, July 11, 2008, p.B1 However, on January 26, 2009 the company informed Rohm and Haas that it would be unable to complete the transaction by the agreed upon deadline. Dow cited a deteriorated credit market and the collapse of the K-Dow Petrochemical deal as reasons for failing to timely close the merger. Around the same time, CEO Andrew Liveris said a first- time cut to the company's 97- year- old dividend policy was not \\"off the table\\". On February 12, 2009, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15/share, down from $0.42 the previous quarter. The cut represented the first time the company had diminished its investor payout in the dividend's 97-year history. The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas closed on April 1, 2009. After negotiating the sale of preferred stock with Rohm and Hass' two largest stockholders and extending their one-year bridge loan an additional year, the company purchased Rohm and Haas for $15 billion ($78 a share) on March 9, 2009. 2007 dismissal of senior executives On April 12, 2007, Dow dismissed two senior executives for \\"unauthorized discussions with third parties about the potential sale of the company\\". The two figures are executive vice president Romeo Kreinberg, and director and former CFO J. Pedro Reinhard. Dow claims they were secretly in contact with JPMorgan Chase; at the same time, a story surfaced in Britain's Sunday Express regarding a possible leveraged buyout of Dow. The two executives have since filed lawsuits claiming they were fired for being a threat to CEO Liveris, and that the allegations were concocted as a pretext. However, in June 2008 Dow Chemical and the litigants announced a settlement in which Kreinberg and Reinhard dropped their lawsuits and admitted taking part in discussions \\"which were not authorized by, nor disclosed to, Dow's board concerning a potential LBO\\" and acknowledged that it would have been appropriate to have informed the CEO and board of the talks. 2008 sale of zoxamide business In summer 2008, Dow sold its zoxamide business to Gowan Company. Included in the sale were the trademarks for a potato and grape fungicide called Gavel (fungicide). It is employed by potato growers to control early and late potato blight and to suppress tuber blight, and is also registered in Canada for control of downy mildew in grapes, except in British Columbia.grainews.ca: \\"Gowan buys Dow‚Äôs Gavel potato fungicide\\", 18 Jul 2008 2014 ‚Äì New operating segments In the fourth quarter of 2014, Dow announced new operating segments in response to its previously announced leadership changes. The company stated it would give further support to its end-market orientation and increase its alignment to Dow's key value chains ‚Äì ethylene and propylene. U.S. Gulf Coast investments Several plants on the Gulf Coast of the US have been in development since 2013, as part of Dow's transition away from naphtha. Dow estimates the facilities will employ about 3000 people, and 5000 people during construction. The plants will manufacture materials for several of its growing segments, including hygiene and medical, transportation, electrical and telecommunications, packaging, consumer durables and sports and leisure. Dow's new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) facility in Freeport, Texas, was expected to come online in 2015, with a first 750000 metric tonne per year unit, while other units would become available in the future. An ethylene production facility was expected to start up in the first half of 2017. Chlorine merger On March 27, 2015, Dow and Olin Corporation announced that the boards of directors of both companies unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which Dow will separate a significant portion of its chlorine business and merge that new entity with Olin in a transaction that will create an industry leader, with revenues approaching $7 billion. Olin, the new partnership, became the largest chlorine producer in the world. 2015 merger and 2019 separation with DuPont Andrew N. Liveris On December 11, 2015, Dow announced that it would merge with DuPont, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which was known as DowDuPont, had an estimated value of $130 billion, was equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintained their respective headquarters in Michigan and Delaware. Within two years of the merger's closure, DowDuPont was set to split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agriculture, chemical, and specialty product industries. Shareholders of each company held 50% of the combined company. Dow Chemical CEO Andrew N. Liveris became executive chairman of the new entity, while DuPont CEO Edward D. Breen became CEO. In January 2017, the merger was pushed back a second time pending regulatory approvals. The same day, Dow also announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Corning Incorporated's stake in their joint venture Dow Corning for $4.8 billion in cash and a roughly 40% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation. In 2019, DowDuPont de-merged, forming Dow Inc.. The spin-off was completed on April 1, 2019, at which time Dow Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company, and the direct parent company of The Dow Chemical Company.\\"Company Overview of Dow Inc.\\", Bloomberg, April 2, 2019. Focus on higher margin business Dow Chemical has begun to shed commodity chemical businesses, such as those making the basic ingredients for grocery bags and plastic pipes, because their profit margins only average 5‚Äì10%. Dow is, as of 2015, focusing its resources on specialty chemicals that earn profit margins of at least 20%.  Dioxin contamination  Watershed of the Tittabawassee River, including Midland, site of the Dow Chemical works. Areas along Michigan's Tittabawassee River, which runs within yards of Dow's main plant in Midland, were found to contain elevated levels of the cancer- causing chemical dioxin in November 2006. The dioxin was located in sediments two to ten feet below the surface of the river, and, according to The New York Times, \\"there is no indication that residents or workers in the area are directly exposed to the sites\\". However, people who often eat fish from the river had slightly elevated levels of dioxin in their blood. In July 2007, Dow reached an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency to remove of sediment from three areas of the riverbed and levees of the river that had been found to be contaminated. In November 2008, Dow Chemical along with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality agreed to establish a Superfund to address dioxin cleanup of the Tittabawassee River, Saginaw River and Saginaw Bay.  Sale of herbicide business  In December 2015, Dow Chemicals agreed to sell part of its global herbicide business, which had reported falling sales for nearly a year. A portfolio of weed killers known as dinitroanilines was sold to privately held Gowan Company, a family owned company located in Yuma, Arizona, which markets a variety of pesticides to the agricultural and horticultural industries.producer.com: \\"Dow sells popular herbicides Treflan and Edge to Gowan\\", 10 Dec 2015 The global trademarks for Treflan (pesticide)¬Æ, which can be sprayed on field corn, cotton and some fruit and vegetables, were included in the sale, as well as a formulation and packaging facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada. Edge (pesticide)¬Æ, Team (pesticide)¬Æ, Bonalan (pesticide)¬Æ and Sonalan (pesticide)¬Æ, intellectual property and labels for herbicides based on the molecules trifluralin, benfluralin and ethalfluralin were also included in the sale. Annual grasses and small seeded broadleaf weeds can be controlled with these products in a wide range of crops including cotton, beans, canola, cereals, crucifers, cucurbits, and vegetables. Dinitroanilines, are also known as \\"DNA herbicides\\", and have been commercialised at least since 1970.dowagro.com: \\"Gowan Company, L.L.C. Agrees to Acquire Global DNA Business from Dow AgroSciences LLC\\", 30 Nov 2015  2020 evacuation  In May 2020, Dow Chemical and many other areas in Midland County, Michigan were forced to evacuate due to high flooding which was caused by the breach of the Edenville and Sanford dams following two days of heavy rainfall in the area.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/19/michigan-flooding- midland-gretchen-whitmer-evacuations/5226587002/  Finance  For the fiscal year 2017, Dow Chemicals reported earnings of US$1.5 billion, with an annual revenue of US$62.5 billion, an increase of 29.8% over the previous fiscal cycle. Dow Chemicals shares traded at over $67 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$121.1 billion in September 2018. { class=\\" float-left\\"  right;\\" !Year !Revenue in mil.

The New York Attorney General's Office stated that Dow AgroSciences had violated a 1994 agreement with the State of New York to stop advertisements making safety claims about its pesticide products. Dow stated that it was not admitting to any wrongdoing, and that it was agreeing to the settlement to avoid a costly court battle. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Dow has some responsibility for 96 of the United States' Superfund toxic waste sites, placing it in 10th place by number of sites. One of these, a former UCC uranium and vanadium processing facility near Uravan, Colorado, is listed as the sole responsibility of Dow. The rest are shared with numerous other companies. Fifteen sites have been listed by the EPA as finalized (cleaned up) and 69 are listed as \\"construction complete\\", meaning that all required plans and equipment for cleanup are in place. In 2007, the chemical industry trade association ‚Äì the American Chemical Council ‚Äì gave Dow an award of 'Exceptional Merit' in recognition of longstanding energy efficiency and conservation efforts. Between 1995 and 2005, Dow reduced energy intensity (BTU per pound produced) by 22 percent. This is equivalent to saving enough electricity to power eight million US homes for a year. The same year, Dow subsidiary, Dow Agrosciences, won a United Nations Montreal Protocol Innovators Award for its efforts in helping replace methyl bromide ‚Äì a compound identified as contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. In addition, Dow Agrosciences won an EPA \\"Best of the Best\\" Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named Dow as a 2008 Energy Star Partner of the Year for excellence in energy management and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Major sponsorships In July 2010, Dow became a worldwide partner of the Olympic Games. The sponsorship extends to 2020. In September 2004, Dow obtained the naming rights to the Saginaw County Event Center in Saginaw, Michigan; the center is now called the Dow Event Center. The Saginaw Spirit (of the Ontario Hockey League) plays at the Center, which also hosts events such as professional wrestling, live theater, and concerts. In October 2006, Dow bought the naming rights to the stadium used by the Great Lakes Loons, a Single-A minor league baseball team located in its hometown of Midland, Michigan. The stadium is called Dow Diamond. The Dow Foundation played a key role in bringing the Loons to the city. In 2010, Dow signed a $100m (¬£63m) 10-year deal with the International Olympic Committee and agreed to sponsor the ¬£7m Olympic Stadium wrap. Since 2014 Dow also sponsors Austin Dillon's #3 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. Major collaborations Lab Safety Academy On May 20, 2013, Dow launched the Dow Lab Safety Academy, a website that includes a large collection of informational videos and resources that demonstrate best practices in laboratory safety. The goal of the website is to improve awareness of safety practices in academic research laboratories and to help the future chemical workforce develop a safety mindset. As such, the Dow Lab Safety Academy is primarily geared toward university students. However, Dow has made the content open to all, including those already employed in the chemical industry. The Dow Lab Safety Academy is also available through the Safety and Chemical Engineering Education program, an affiliate of American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE); and The Campbell Institute, an organization focusing on environment, health and safety practices. The Dow Lab Safety Academy is one component of Dow's larger laboratory safety initiative launched in early 2012, following a report from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board that highlighted the potential hazards associated with conducting research at chemical laboratories in academic institutions. Seeking to share industry best practices with academia, Dow partnered with several U.S. research universities to improve safety awareness and practices in the departments of chemistry, chemical engineering, engineering and materials. Through the pilot programs with U.C. Santa Barbara (UCSB), University of Minnesota, and Pennsylvania State University, Dow worked with graduate students and faculty to identify areas of improvement and develop a culture of laboratory safety. Nature conservancy In January 2011, The Nature Conservancy and The Dow Chemical Co. announced a collaboration to integrate the value of nature into business decision-making. Scientists, engineers, and economists from The Nature Conservancy and Dow are working together at three pilot sites (North America, Latin America, and TBD) to implement and refine models that support corporate decision-making related to the value and resources nature provides. Those ecosystem services include water, land, air, oceans and a variety of plant and animal life. These sites will serve as a ‚Äúliving laboratories‚Äù, to validate and test methods and models so they can be used to inform more sustainable business decisions at Dow and hopefully influence the decision-making and business practices of other companies.

The city is located around a 90 min drive south of Mexico City using the Federal Highway 95D. The name \\"Cuernavaca\\" is an euphonism derived from the Nahuatl toponym \\"CuauhnƒÅhuac\\" and means \\"surrounded by or close to trees\\". The name was Hispanicized to Cuernavaca; Hern√°n Cort√©s called it Coadnabaced in his letters to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Bernal D√≠az del Castillo used the name Cuautlavaca in his chronicles. The coat-of-arms of the municipality is based on the pre-Columbian pictograph emblem of the city which depicts a tree trunk (cuahuitl) with three branches, with foliage, and four roots colored red. There is a cut in the trunk in the form of a mouth, from which emerges a speech scroll, probably representing the language Nahuatl and by extension the locative suffix \\"-nƒÅhuac\\", meaning \\"near\\". Cuernavaca has long been a favorite escape for Mexico City and foreign visitors because of its warm, stable climate and abundant vegetation. The municipality was designated a Forest Protection Zone by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937 to protect the aquifers, the vegetation and the quality of life of residents both in Mexico City and locally.http://www.cuernavaca.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Proy-Acuerdo- Declarat-area-nat-BOSQUE-MIRADOR-1.pdf accessed Dec 30, 2018 The city was nicknamed the \\"City of Eternal Spring\\" by Alexander von Humboldt in the 19th century. Aztec emperors had summer residences there, and considering its location of just a 1¬Ω-hour drive from Mexico City, today many Mexico City residents maintain homes there. Cuernavaca is also host to a large foreign resident population, including large numbers of students who come to study the Spanish language. The city City of Eternal Spring Flora in the Jard√≠n Borda Cuernavaca was one of the cities of the world nicknamed \\"City of Eternal Spring\\". This appelative derived from Alexander von Humboldt's Researches concerning the institutions & monuments of the ancient inhabitants of America...: The city is located in a tropical region, but its temperature is fairly constant at . It is located on the southern slope of the Sierra de Chichinautzin mountains. In the morning, warm air flows up the mountains from the valley below and in the late afternoon, cooler air flows down from the higher elevations. One ubiquitous flowering plant in the city is the bougainvillea. This pleasant climate has attracted royalty and nobles since Aztec times. Foreign princes, archdukes, and other nobles have been attracted to this place because of its flowers, sun, fruits, fresh-water springs, and waterfalls. Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico set up a country residence in the city. Philanthropist Barbara Hutton, who held several royal titles through marriage, had a home on the outskirts of the city. Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy (b. 1943) lived there from 1971 to 1999, and the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, lived in exile in the city following the Iranian Revolution. Although a native of the U.S., Bauhaus designer Michael van Beuren established his residence in a family hacienda in Cuernavaca while fleeing the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany (where he studied and practiced his profession), and a colony of Bauhaus designers grew in the city during World War II.  Cuernavaca metropolitan area  Highway in the newer area of the city Cuernavaca always has been a popular place for people from Mexico City to escape the city. In the 20th century, the climate and flora began to attract many foreigners as well. Population increase in this urban area began in 1940, but the metro area was not created, nor recognized, until the 1960s. From this time the population and the extension of the metropolitan area have grown. From 1960 to 1980, the population had grown from 85,620 to 368,166. From the 1980s to the present, the municipalities of Emiliano Zapata, Jiutepec, Temixco, Tepoztl√°n, and Xochitepec have been added to the metropolitan area. These municipalities have seen the highest rates of growth, however; population and economic activity remain concentrated in the city of Cuernavaca proper. The metropolitan area has a population of 912,024 and the municipality has 366,321 inhabitants, as of 2015. Over the decades since 1970, this metropolitan area has become more economically and socially integrated with the Mexico City metropolitan area. Many people from Mexico City own second homes there for weekend retreats, both for the climate and for the well- developed infrastructure. Starting in the 1980s permanent migration of Mexico City residents began, spurred by pollution and crime problems in the capital. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake also pushed many well-to-do families there, fearful of the next catastrophe. In many of these cases, the main breadwinner commutes each day to work in Mexico City. This has produced a considerable increase in housing developments on the outskirts of the city, especially in the late 1990s and 2000s. This influx has had a positive economic benefit for the city but has put pressure on the infrastructure as well. 85% of the city of Cuernavaca is dedicated to housing, and much of this is in middle-class housing developments such as Rancho Cort√©s, Rancho Tetela, and Colonia del Bosque, which are located on the outskirts of the city. Lower-income housing is concentrated in the city proper. History Indigenous peoples Ruins at Teopanzolco, Cuernavaca Burials dated to c. 1000 BCE have been found in Gualupita, Morelos, in the north of the city. The first major culture to inhabit this area was the Tlahuica, whose main settlement was where the city of Cuernavaca is today. The Tlahuicas have inhabited this area at least since the 12th century. The first incursions south into the area by peoples of the Valley of Mexico occurred in the 12th century, when a lord named Xolotl (ruler of Tetzcoco) conquered most of the Valley of Mexico. An allied Chichimeca tribe also moved south into what is now northern Morelos state, making Techintecuitla lord of the Cuahnahuac (as they called the city) area, with the Tlahuicas concentrated in the nearby towns of Yecapixtla and Yautecatle. According to the Tlatelolco Annals, in 1365, the lord of Cuahnahuac, Macuilxochitl, tried to conquer lands as far as the Valley of Mexico, but was met by the lord of Chalco, Tzalcualtitlan, with similar ambitions. The first Aztec emperor, Acamapichtli, began to expand his empire to the south of the Valley of Mexico and beyond in the 1370s. His successor, Huitzilihuitl, was eager to press on into what is now Morelos state because of the cotton grown there, it was called Tlalnahuatl at that time. He asked to marry the daughter of the ruler of Tlalnahuatl but was rejected. That rejection started a war that ended with an Aztec victory in 1396. Huitziliuitl then married the princess and Moctezuma I was born of the union. Credit for the conquest of Cuernavaca is given to Acamapichtli in the Mendocino Codex, but later writings cite Itzc√≥atl, or even Moctezuma I, as the conqueror. The conquered dominion, Tlalnahuac, was roughly the size of the modern state of Morelos, and subsequently was renamed as Cuauhnahuac by the Aztecs. From 1403 to 1426, this province grew in strength, subduing neighboring peoples such as the Coauixcas. Eventually, the province, then ruled by Miquiuix, rebelled against the Aztec Empire. This rebellion was put down by Totoquihuatzin and Netzahualcoyotl in 1433. This area then joined in the conquests of what now are known as Taxco, Tepecuacuilco, and Ocuil√°n. For tribute purposes, the dominion was divided into two zones, one headed by Cuauhnahuac and the other by Huaxtepec. Spanish Conquest and colonization Palace of Cort√©s, the oldest conserved colonial era civil structure on the continental Americas At the time of the Spanish Conquest, Itzohuatzin was governing Cuahnanhauc. It was a rich city and densely populated, with large farms and its characteristic ravines bridged over. The Spanish marched on Cuernavaca even before taking the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, They were led by Gonzalo de Sandoval and he was joined later by the conquistador, Hern√°n Cort√©s. The bridges were destroyed to prevent the Spanish from entering the city, but they were able to cross on a fallen tree. The Spanish troops pillaged and burned the city before retiring to nearby Acapantzingo, where they celebrated the first mass in Morelos on Sunday, April 14, 1521, before continuing their march on the capital. The Spanish had difficulty pronouncing the Nahua name of the city and changed it to Cuernavaca. Cort√©s returned to Cuernavaca in 1523, stopping in Tlaltenango, where he founded the Church of San Jos√© and constructed the first sugar plantation. The fertility of these lands compelled the conquistador to found his favorite residence here. Juana de Z√∫√±iga, Cortes's wife, lived in Cuernavaca in the palace that was constructed in 1526. Cortes then moved the hacienda in Tlaltenango to Amatitlan. The Franciscans arrived in Cuernavaca in 1529 and founded their 5th monastery in New Spain there. This first group included Mart√≠n de Lua, Francisco Mart√≠nez, Luis Ortiz, Juan de Cervo, Francisco de Soto, Andr√©s de C√≥rdova, Mart√≠n de Jes√∫s, Juan Ju√°rez, Juan de Motolin√≠a, and Juan Garc√≠a de Cervo. Originally they lived at the San Francisquito hermitage, but later they constructed the open-air chapel, Capilla Abierta, at what was to become a monastery and eventually the Cuernavaca Cathedral. They extended their presence into the neighboring communities of Tetecala, Jiutepec, and Tlaquiltenango, among others, eventually forming the province of Santo Evangelio, which would be part of the province of Mexico in 1543. In 1646, this province was reorganized several times. Cuernavaca and Cuautla became high mayorships which answered directly to the viceregal authorities in Mexico City. In 1786, New Spain was divided into twelve provinces and in 1824, Cuernavaca was initially a district of Mexico City. Independence to Revolution During the Mexican War of Independence, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos was imprisoned at the Palacio de Cort√©s in November 1815. Agust√≠n de Iturbide's army passed through Cuernavaca to fight Vicente Guerrero in 1820 and came through again in 1821, as the head of the Ej√©rcito Trigarante. After Independence and with the Constitution of 1824, the territory now known as the State of Morelos became part of the State of Mexico. Between 1827 and 1829, Cuernavaca was a district of this state. From 1829 to 1833, it was called a prefecture. In 1833, the State of Mexico declared the Atlacomulco Hacienda, which contains the Palacio de Cort√©s and Cort√©s's houses in Coyoac√°n, to be public property. Main altar of the Chapel of The Third Order of Saint Francis In 1834, Ignacio Echevarr√≠a and Jos√© Mar√≠a Tornel drafted the Plan of Cuernavaca, which permitted Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to disregard the laws protecting church property, exile Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, reopen the university, and dissolve the tribunal that was set to convict Anastasio Bustamante for the assassination of Vicente Guerrero. In the same year, the State of Mexico declared Cuernavaca to be a city. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846-1847), Cuernavaca was captured by the Cadwalader Brigade and was forced to pay retributions to the U.S. Army after the Cuernavaca Infantry under Francisco Modesto Olabuibel fell. During the Ayutla Rebellion in 1854, Santa Anna was forced out of the capital of Mexico City in 1855. He moved his government to Cuernavaca, reorganized it, and named a junta to elect an interim president. This junta consisted of Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, Melchor Ocampo, Benito Ju√°rez, Francisco de P. Zendejas, Diego √Ålvarez, and Joaqu√≠n Moreno. They then voted for Alvarez as president. This new president swore to uphold the Plan of Ayutla and his inauguration was celebrated with much pomp in the city. Ministers from Guatemala, the United States, and Great Britain, as well as the Apostolic Delegate and the Consuls of Belgium, Chile, and some Asian countries, moved to Cuernavaca and recognized the government √Ålvarez. In 1853, the District of Cuernavaca and the District of Mexico were declared separate. During the Reform War (1857‚Äì1860) when conservatives rejected the liberal constitution of 1857, Juan Vicario voiced the cry of \\"Religi√≥n y Fueros\\" (Religion and Immunity) in Cuernavaca on 13 January 1858. In 1861, the Government of the State of Mexico created the districts of Cuernavaca, Jonacatepec, Tautepec, and Tetecala. In order to facilitate operations against the French during the French Intervention, President Juarez divided the State of Mexico into three military districts. The third consisted of the territories of Cuernavaca, Yautepec, and Tetecala, with its capital in the city of Cuernavaca. Soon thereafter, this district fell into French hands. Maximilian I converted the Borda Garden into his summer residence and bought land in nearby Acapantzingo to construct a chalet. This prompted the construction of the Mexico-Cuernavaca highway. When the French-installed monarch fell in 1867, Republican forces under Francisco Leyva, Ignacio Figueroa, and Ignacio Manuel Altamirano laid siege to Cuernavaca, which was defended by General Joaqu√≠n Ayestar√°n. The attackers cut off water supplies to the city and attacked on 3 January, but were met with a long series of street battles throughout the city. During the fighting, the general was killed and the Republican forces withdrew, victorious, to Mexico City, but only after burning a large portion of the city. Emiliano Zapata in Cuernavaca The State of Morelos was created in April 1869, with General Francisco Leyva as its first governor. Cuernavaca was declared the capital of the new state in November of the same year. In 1877, under Governor Carlos Pacheco, the Toluca- Cuernavaca highway was built and a rail connection created between Cuernavaca and Mexico City. The Porfirio D√≠az Theater was opened in February 1882, and the first Public Health Board in the city was established the same year. In 1891, the Diocese of Cuernavaca was established by Pope Leo XII, comprising the entire state of Morelos, with Hipolito Vera as the first bishop of Cuernavaca. The first locomotive arrived on December 1, 1897, and a bridge was constructed to connect the center of the city with the train station. The Bank of Morelos was founded in 1903. Mexican Revolution & 20th century In 1909, the anti-reelection movement was established in Cuernavaca, and by the end of this same year guerilla operations against the Diaz government were headed by Genovevo de la O in Santa Mar√≠a Ahuacatitl√°n. Emiliano Zapata took over the movement in the south and named De la O in charge of the Cuernavaca area. On May 21, 1911, Cuernavaca was evacuated by government troops, leaving the entire state in rebel hands. Professor Brunk, describing Zapata's triumph, writes \\"On the twenty-sixth, at 4 o'clock on a bright Friday afternoon, Zapata rode triumphantly into that city at the head of four thousand troops. Waving images of the Virgin of Guadalupe overhead, these revolutionaries were a ragged lot in the eyes of the urbane. But to the throngs who greeted them - the common people of Morelos, the young girls with armfuls of bougainvillea - they were conquering heroes.\\" President Francisco I. Madero visited the city on June 12, 1911, and he attended a banquet in the Borda Garden. The city later fell to the forces of Huerta, and Zapata began to lay siege to Cuernavaca in May 1914 with 3,600 men, falling by August. Later, on January 26, 1915, the Revolutionary government was moved to the city, in defiance of Carranza and the Constitutionalists. However, Zapata lost control of Cuernavaca on May 2, 1916 and was forced to return to guerilla warfare. The Spanish flu came to Cuernavaca in 1918, leaving only 3,000 survivors, although by May 1920 it had a population of 12,799. The Head Government Building of Cuernavaca Wealthy North Americans and Europeans established secondary residences in Cuernavaca and took long vacations there or frequently traveled back and forth, while servants maintained the haciendas in their absence. Sometimes, their offspring have made Cuernavaca their permanent residence, creating an enclave of natives with international roots bearing the influence of their cultures. For example, when the American designer, Michael van Beuren fled Germany with members of Bauhaus, where he was practicing his profession, he took up residence at the vacation hacienda of his parents in Cuernavaca, and stayed permanently, establishing his factory nearby and raising his family there. Others in his family began to reside there year 'round. Their children were natives of Mexico. After his installation as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico in 1927, American businessman Dwight Morrow established a weekend home in Cuernavaca on the street that today bears his name. It was here that his daughter Anne met famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, whom Morrow had invited to Mexico. In celebration of his daughter's engagement to Lindbergh and to thank the people of Cuernavaca, in 1929 Morrow commissioned Diego Rivera to paint the mural \\"History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution\\" at the Palacio de Cortes.https://memoriapoliticademexico.org/Biografias/MDW73.html During the 1920s and 1930s, Cuernavaca became a place to vacation and gamble when the Hotel de la Selva was converted into the Casino de la Selva, which attracted people such as Rita Hayworth, Bugsy Siegel, and Al Capone to Cuernavaca, however, gambling was shut down by L√°zaro C√°rdenas in 1934. He is the same president who declared the area a ZPG (Forest Protection Zone). The casino hosted very important artistic works, including murals of Alvarez Icaza, Messeguer, and the architecture of Candela. The main vault was considered to be the \\"Mexican Sistine Chapel\\" by Nobel Prize author, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. 1936 was the year that Malcolm Lowry wrote his short story, \\"Under The Volcano\\", which inspired his 1947 novel of the same name. It has never gone out of print and was made into a movie in 1984. Cuernavaca, or Quaunahuac, as it is called in the novel, and the surrounding area, figure prominently in this great historical novel, where extensive details on Mexican history, culture, topography, and especially, politics and religion figure prominently. The recurrent artifacts are the twin volcanos, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, and the barranca, symbols of division, death, and rebirth in the city of eternal spring. Dr. Sergio M√©ndez Arceo became bishop of Cuernavaca in 1952. Mendez was known as a leading voice of Liberation Theology and he was a human rights activist. In 1956, Erich Fromm founded the Sociedad Mexicana de Psicoan√°lisis and from his house in Cuernavaca promoted new ideas in the field of psychiatry, incorporating Zen Buddhism and \\"communal psychoanalytic studies\\" (estudios psicoanal√≠ticos comunitarios). This attracted many artists, composers, architects, and counterculture types here. In the 1960s, the city was one of the centers of the psychedelic movement. Timothy Leary tried psilocybin mushrooms there in the summer of 1960 and came back regularly to repeat the experience. There was a riot in Cuernavaca in February 1957 after a police officer shot and killed Jorge Garrig√≥s. In 1966, Austrian priest Ivan Illich founded the Centro Intercultural de Documentaci√≥n (CIDOC) to teach Spanish language and culture to North American missionaries. This center was closed by order of the Vatican in 1969, but several of the teachers continued elsewhere in the city, making Cuernavaca a leading center of Spanish-language teaching for foreigners. More recently the city has seen a very active society dedicated to the preservation of its environment and cultural heritage. The Frente Civico which is now influential throughout the country, along with some 150 other organizations has promoted a boycott against Costco for having destroyed the Casino de la Selva to build a couple of warehouses. One of its members, Professor Jaime Lagunez, lobbied a general agreement in the national congress for the purpose of protecting its sixty archeological sites, its vegetation, historic center, and neighboring forests, among other important cultural aspects of the city. (see https://es.scribd.com/document/322348956/Punto-de-Acuerdo). The Frente Civico received the 2004 National Mendez Arceo Human Rights Award for having protected the world cultural heritage found in the city. 21st century The September 19, 2017 earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 killed four people and damaged or destroyed 180 homes, 11 churches, and 10 other Cuernavaca buildings, including the Cort√©s Palace, the cathedral, and the landmark Torre Latinoamericana, according to Fernando Manrique Rivas, general director of Protecci√≥n Civil de Cuernavaca. Cuernavaca instituted a curfew and possible arrest for 36 hours for violators during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Open-air restaurants and bars were closed. Mayor Antonio Villalobos Adan commented on May 1 that the city needs a new cemetery with capacity for 15,000 people, since the city's seven cemeteries are all saturated. It is already estimated that 40% of the population in the Antonio Barona neighborhood has been contaminated by COVID-19. On June 2, Cuernavaca reported 393 confirmed cases and 83 deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Cuernavaca reported 1,322 cases, 1,015 recuperations, and 223 deaths on August 31. Points of interest Palace of Cort√©s Palacio de Cort√©s seen from the zocalo of Cuernavaca The Palacio de Cort√©s is east of the Morelos Garden and is considered to be the most representative building of Cuernavaca. Built by Hern√°n Cort√©s, it was finished in 1535. It is one of the oldest European-style, civil constructions in the Americas, but is executed in Renaissance style. The series of arches of the central terrace, the battlements, and the thick walls are the most representative aspects of the original construction. It is said that this residence looks much like the mansion built in Santo Domingo by Diego Col√≥n, the son of Christopher Columbus. Just outside the front of the building is an old pyramid base over which Cort√©s had the structure built, on a hill that dominated the old city. Petroglyphs recovered from the site and from throughout the city are on display. From right to left the petroglyphs are named Lagarto de San Ant√≥n, Aguila de Chapultepec, Piedra Chimalli, or Piedra de los Encantos. After having been the residence of Cort√©s and his descendants for several centuries, the building became a warehouse, a jail, a military barracks, and then the State Government Palace (until 1969). From 1971 to 1973, the building was restored extensively and today houses the Museo Regional Cuauhn√°huac, dedicated to the history of Morelos State. It often is referred to as \\"the Palacio of Cortes.\\" It has ten exhibit halls with maps, illustrations, photographs, works of art, and everyday items from various epochs representing the first human settlements in the state to the present day. It has murals created by Diego Rivera that reflect both Morelos and Mexican history. Adjacent to the Palacio a permanent local handicraft market in which one may purchase silver jewelry, T-shirts, beaded bracelets, pottery, hammocks, blankets, and much more. Morelos and Ju√°rez Gardens Ju√°rez Garden The Ju√°rez and Morelos Gardens are in the center of the city, both of which are plazas lined with trees. Between the two is the State Government Palace, a three-story building with a tezontle fa√ßade built between 1955 and 1969. The Morelos Garden dates from 1908 and is easily recognizable by the large stone statue of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, which is known colloquially as \\"Morelotes\\". The Ju√°rez Garden is located to the north of the State Government Palace and is the oldest public square in Cuernavaca. The Garden contains a kiosk sometimes said to be designed by Gustave Eiffel and brought from Britain toward the end of the 19th century. Unlike most main squares in Mexico, neither of these open up the way to the main cathedral. The main cathedral in Cuernavaca is located a few blocks west of the square. These two gardens or plazas are known colloquially as the \\"z√≥calo\\". Spectacles are often to be seen here and can include people dancing the \\"danz√≥n\\" or other popular dances and \\"estudiantinas\\" dressed in colonial-era Spanish garb, playing instruments and dancing, and any number of free concerts. Often clowns perform on the zocalo as well, with balloons and tricks for the children and tell double-entendre jokes for the adults. Locals use the plazas to sell products such as honey, yogurt, traditional candies, and crafts. Street food such as corn on the cob, snow cones, candies, fruit smoothies, and more generally are available. Cathedral Cathedral Cuernavaca Cathedral is the main church of what was the monastery of the Third Order of the Franciscans, called La Asunci√≥n, that dates back to the 16th century. It sits on the southeast corner of a large atrium, which also contains a number of other chapels that were built at different times and with different architectural styles. This complex is located at the intersection of Hidalgo and Morelos streets, a few blocks west of the town center. The cathedral was built by Cort√©s to double as a fortress, with cannons mounted above the buttresses. Over time, this church underwent a number of transformations, updating its interior. This was undone in the mid-20th century, when restoration work removed all the Neoclassical altars and images. These now are stored in the cathedral's pinacotheca and not available to the public. Restoration work uncovered al fresco murals on the lateral walls, relating to the martyrdom of Philip of Jesus, the first Mexican canonized as a saint. The only other decoration inside this church now is a modern-style crucifix and an image of the Assumption of Mary. This restoration work was carried out by Bishop Sergio M√©ndez Arceo. After the Reform Laws in the 1860s, most of the monastery property passed into state, then private hands, leaving only what is now the cathedral and several smaller chapels on a very large atrium. The Revolution Garden was the orchard of the Cathedral, and the cloister with its observatory, is now the Robert Brady Museum. The church became the Cathedral of Cuernavaca in 1891. Cathedral's side-chapel at sunset Next to the cathedral is the \\"open chapel\\" (capilla abierta) of San Jos√©, which is an original structure built in the 16th century. It also was rescued and restored by Bishop M√©ndez Arceo and is one of the oldest constructions on the site. The building consists of a vault with three arches that face the atrium. These arches are supported by a pair of flying buttresses. Inside the arches is an altarpiece dating from the 17th century. The main entrance is on Hidalgo Street, where one passes between two large chapels called the Chapel of Santa Cruz and the Chapel of the Tercera Orden. The Tercera Orden is considered to be the more valuable artistically of the two, with its highly sculpted early Baroque main and side portals painted in various colors. Inside, there is a later Churrigueresque main altar. A third chapel, called the Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora de los Dolores is farther into the atrium and near the Open Chapel of San Jos√©. The bell tower was added in 1713. The cathedral was damaged during the September, 2017 earthquake, but it has since been restored. Other churches of interest *Parish of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe (El Sagrario) was built as a family chapel by Manuel de la Borda in the 18th century.

It is located off Guerrero Street in the old district of Tecoac, which was one of the five neighborhoods that made up the center of the City of Cuernavaca. For years it was the symbol of the city due to its picturesque fa√ßade flanked by two cypresses. This temple is designed in neoclassic style, dedicated to Jesus of Nazareth. The church a small atrium, an open chapel, and a nave in addition to two bells that date from 1791. Fr. William Wasson founded the orphanage Nuestros Peque√±os Hermanos here in 1954.

The chapel is round and is used for Catholic retreats. There are a number of non-Catholic churches in Cuernavaca also, notably the Episcopal Cathedral of San Miguel Arc√°ngel located at the corner of Calles Guerrero and Santos, Centro Historico. Teopanzolco Teopanzolco is an archeological site located just east of the historic downtown of Cuernavaca. Until recently its construction was dated to the year 1427, but new evidence revealed by the September 19, 2017 earthquake suggests the original structure was built between 1150 and 1200 CE.http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/patrimonio/sismo-revela-estructura- en-piramide-de-teopanzolco Retrieved Dec 16, 2018. Teopanzolco was an important ceremonial center during the 15th and 16th centuries when the native Tlahuicas were dominated by the Aztecs. The site shows significant Aztec influence. It has a large pyramidal base, called the Gran Basamento, topped by two shrines, much like the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan. In fact, the new finds indicate that Teopanzolco predates the Templo Mayor and served as a model for the latter.https://www.excelsior.com.mx/expresiones/sismo-devela- huellas-prehispanicas-en-teopanzolco/1251823 Retrieved Dec 16, 2018. Only the stone columns of these shrines remain today. The teocalli, (sacred plaza) contains fourteen monuments including a circular altar dedicated to the wind deity Eh√©catl. There are also two concentric structures separated by a moat or ditch. Both might have been dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, the feathered-serpent deity, or to TlƒÅloc, god or rain. The ruins were discovered during the Siege of Cuernavaca in 1914 as the Zapatistas used the heights to place their cannons.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earthquake-reveals-12th- century-temple-hidden-within-aztec-pyramid-180969619/ (Dec 16, 2018) Centro Cultural Teopanzolco The Cultural Center next to the pyramids has recently been remodeled and now includes several first-class concert halls.

Originally, this was a house bought by Jos√© de la Borda, the mining magnate of Taxco in the mid-18th century. Later, his son, Manuel de Borda y Verdugo, transformed the grounds of the house into gardens filled with flower and fruit trees to satisfy his passion for botany. These gardens also contain a number of fountains and an artificial lake that were completed in 1783. Today the complex contains an art gallery, offices, a restaurant, and an open-air theater. In 1865, this was the summer home of Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Carlota Amalia. Some sources say the emperor met his mistress, \\"La India Bonita,\\" there, (although other sources say they met at his home called \\"El Olindo\\" in Acapantzingo.) In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Borda Garden sponsored soirees, such as those sponsored by Porfirio D√≠az and Emiliano Zapata. Today the area is a public park where the gardens have been maintained and it is possible to take a short boat ride on the lake. The house has been converted into a museum. Six of its halls are dedicated to temporary exhibits while the other seven are devoted to recreating the characteristics of the 18th and 19th centuries. The Church of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe is located next to the Borda Garden, and was constructed by Manuel de la Borda in 1784. It has a Baroque fa√ßade and what is considered to be the best cupola in the city. It was the royal chapel of Emperor Maximilian. The cupola was badly damaged in the earthquake of 2017. Robert Brady Museum Exterior of the Museum Museum Courtyard The Robert Brady Museum is on Nezahualcoyotl Street and occupies the building known as the Casa de la Torre, originally part of the monastery of La Asunci√≥n. In 1960, it was purchased by the U.S. artist, Robert Brady, who transformed it into his home and a private art and collectible museum. It contains a collection of art and crafts from around the world as well as the original Self-Portrait with Monkey painted by Frida Kahlo. Other works are by artists such as Miguel Cobarruvias, Pelegr√≠ Clav√©, Mar√≠a Izquierdo, and Rufino Tamayo. Non-Mexican paintings include those from North America and Europe. Other objects in the collection include antique furniture, African and Indian crafts, and archeological pieces. The collection occupies fourteen rooms of the old house, which has been kept mostly the way it was when Brady died in 1986 and bequeathed the house and its contents to the city. Tlaltenango Atrium and fa√ßade of the Nuestra Se√±ora de los Milagros Church interior of the Church of San Jose Tlaltenango used to be a separate town, but now is a neighborhood of Cuernavaca city. The main attraction there is the church compound containing the Church of San Jos√© and the Church of Nuestra Se√±ora de los Milagros de Tlaltenango. San Jos√© is one of the oldest churches in Mexico, built between 1521 and 1523. Two centuries later an image of the Virgin appeared to members of this village, prompting the building of the second church. This is the Sanctuary of Nuestra Se√±ora de los Milagros, which was built in 1730, with its bell towers built at the end of the 19th century. Hacienda Atlacomulco The Hacienda de San Antonio Atlacomulco is located south of the Cuernavaca and was established by Hern√°n Cort√©s as one of the first sugar plantations in Mexico. Descendants of the Conquistador held the property until the 19th century, when it became the property of Lucas Alam√°n, who modernized the facility. The hacienda lost its surrounding properties during the Mexican Revolution and all that remains is the main house. After a long period of restoration and modification, the hacienda today houses an exclusive hotel, which can accommodate conventions and banquets. Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine and the Ethnicbotanical garden South of the city center is Acapantzingo, which had been a separate town, but now is part of the city. A large farm owned by Emperor Maximilian I existed there in the 1860s. It was named Olindo, referring to a character in the poem by Torquato Tasso. The emperor used this property as one of his residences in Cuernavaca, and according to rumor, to enjoy the company of a certain beautiful Indian woman. On this farm and in what was the Pavilion, is now the Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine (Museo de Medicina Tradicional). The museum sponsors workshops and classes on the use of plants to make soap, cremes, dyes, decorative objects and more. Outside is the ethnicbotanical garden with exhibits including 800 species of plants organized by uses, such as the making of textiles, animal feed, condiments, ritual, and others. Children's \\"Kite\\" Museum Located on Avenida Vicente Guerrero 205, Colonia Lomas de Selva is the Papalote Children's Museum an interactive children's museum with up to thirty exhibitions and artistic experiences for children, such as a bed of nails, Vincent van Gogh room, Lego, garden, sandbox, bubble factory, and others. Some exhibits are even for children under 3. Chapultepec Ecological Park The Chapultepec Ecological Park is located about four km southeast of the Cuernavaca city center. It contains fresh-water springs, which form the beginning of a river, and is surrounded by large trees called Chapultepec. It is a public park administered by the State Commission of Water and Environment. In addition to playgrounds, the park has constructed habitats for monkeys, birds, butterflies, crocodiles, reptiles, aquatic plants, and orchids. It also has a petting zoo, environmental museum, planetarium, house of terror, theater, and tour train. Beginning December 2018, Diana R√≠os, a Mexican designer and artist working with the company Veneno R√≠os is in charge of creating a new fa√ßade called ‚ÄúMetamorphosis‚Äù inspired in evolution and species changes as well as the love of nature in Morelos. Featured species are the cangrejito barranque√±o (a crab), the carpita morelense (carp), and the amate amarillo (yellow fig tree)./ Chapitel del Calvario Interior of the Chapitel del Calvario The Chapitel del Calvario The Chapitel del Calvario is a church located at the corner of Morelos and Matamoros Streets, which was constructed in 1532. The word \\"chapitel\\" means \\"spire\\" as the church is named after two spires that define its appearance. It also has a fourteen-meter-high dome. It was constructed in the 16th century and was the last building encountered within Cuernavaca, as one left the city on the road to Mexico City. In 1772, this church was dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe. El Castillito The Museo de Fotograf√≠a Antigua, also known as El Castillito (the little castle), is located one block from the Chapitel del Calvario. It is a very small, brick building that dates from the early 20th century when it was built as a home for the caretaker of the park that is next to the bridge built by Porfirio Diaz. It was later abandoned until Governor Vicente Estrada Cajigal remodeled it as his residence. Since 1986 it has been a small museum dedicated to antique photographs of the city of Cuernavaca. Salto de San Ant√≥n / St. Anthony Waterfall Inside the Salto de San Ant√≥n ravine The Salto de San Anton is a large ravine with a small waterfall located in the neighborhood of San Anton Analco on the west side of Cuernavaca. The waterfall is high, with its water coming from a small tributary of the Zempoala River. The vertical walls of the ravine are of basalt and broad-leafed vegetation grows in nooks and crannies of the stone. A series of stairs and platforms have been built to enable access to the waterfall area from the park above. The area is a popular place to purchase potted plants. Museo Morelense de Arte Contempor√°neo Juan Soriano The Juan Soriano Museum of Contemporary Art is located east of downtown near the Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos Market in Colonia Amatitlan. The museum opened amidst controversy on June 8, 2018, and includes a collection of 1,200 paintings, sculptures, drawings, and photographs, including a permanent collection of works by the artist Juan Soriano. The museum was designed by the architect Javier Sanchez and it cost 300 million pesos (US$15 million) to build. Ravine of Amanalco Park / Barranca de Amanalco The ravines of Cuernavaca play a major role in regulating the climate of the city. One of the most important is the Ravine of Amanalco, which served as a natural defensive line for the city of Cuauhuanauc during the Spanish conquest of 1520, until Hernan Cortes managed to cross it where the modern \\"Puente del Diablo\\" is located.

Panic may occur singularly in individuals or manifest suddenly in large groups as mass panic (closely related to herd behavior).  Etymology  The word derives from antiquity and is a tribute to the ancient god Pan. One of the many gods in the mythology of ancient Greece, Pan was the god of shepherds and of woods and pastures. The Greeks believed that he often wandered peacefully through the woods, playing a pipe, but when accidentally awakened from his noontime nap he could give a great shout that would cause flocks to stampede. From this aspect of Pan's nature Greek authors derived the word panikos, ‚Äúsudden fear,‚Äù the ultimate source of the English word: \\"panic\\". The Greek term indicates the feeling of total fear that is also sudden and often attributed to the presence of a god.  Psychology  In psychology, panic is identified as a disorder and is related strongly to biological and psychological factors and their interactions. A view described one of its incidences as a specific psychological vulnerability of people to interpret normal physical sensations in a catastrophic way. Leonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner describe panic as ‚Äúthat terrible, profound emotion that stretches us beyond our ability to imagine any experience more horrible‚Äù adding that ‚Äúphysicians like to compare painful clinical conditions on some imagined ‚ÄòRichter scale‚Äô of vicious, mean hurt ‚Ä¶ to the psychiatrist there is no more vicious, mean hurt than an exploding and personally disintegrating panic attack.‚ÄùLeonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner (eds), Panic: Origins, Insight, and Treatment (Berkeley CA: North Atlantic Books, 2002), xiii Bank run on the Seamen's Savings' Bank during the Panic of 1857. Panic in social psychology is considered infectious since it can spread to a multitude of people and those affected are expected to act irrationally as a consequence. Psychologists identify different types of this panic event with slightly varying descriptions and these include mass hysteria, mass psychosis, mass panic, and social contagion. An influential theoretical treatment of panic is found in Neil J. Smelser's Theory of Collective Behavior. The science of panic management has found important practical applications in the armed forces and emergency services of the world.  Effects  Prehistoric humans used mass panic as a technique when hunting animals, especially ruminants. Herds reacting to unusually strong sounds or unfamiliar visual effects were directed towards cliffs, where they eventually jumped to their deaths when cornered. Humans are also vulnerable to panic and it is often considered infectious, in the sense one person's panic may easily spread to other people nearby and soon the entire group acts irrationally, but people also have the ability to prevent and/or control their own and others' panic by disciplined thinking or training (such as disaster drills). Architects and city planners try to accommodate for the symptoms of panic, such as herd behavior, during design and planning, often using simulations to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit and prevent congestion (stampedes). The most effective methods are often non-intuitive. A tall column or columns, placed in front of the door exit at a precisely calculated distance, may speed up the evacuation of a large room, as the obstacle divides the congestion well ahead of the choke point. Many highly publicized cases of deadly panic occurred during massive public events. The layout of Mecca was extensively redesigned by Saudi authorities in an attempt to eliminate frequent stampedes, which kill an average of 250 pilgrims every year. Football stadiums have seen deadly crowd rushes and stampedes, such as at Heysel stadium in Belgium in 1985 with more than 600 casualties, including 39 deaths, and at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, England, in 1989 when 96 people were killed in a crush.

One Israeli Jew was killed by a stone dropped from a bridge onto her vehicle near one such demonstration; however, it is not clear that the incident was linked. The commission released its findings on \\"the clashes between security forces and Israeli civilians\\" on September 2, 2003. The chief investigator was Theodor Or, an Israeli Supreme Court Justice.Or, Theodor on the website of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law Main conclusions of the Or Commission Police responsibility The governmental body of inquiry criticised the Israeli police for being unprepared for the riots and using excessive force to disperse the protesting and rioting citizens. Eight policemen were reprimanded by the commission, most of them after they had retired from the police force. Two police officers were released from the force due to the conclusions. Official responsibility As the Commission's mandate was one of inquiry, no action was taken against most of those warned by it, but rather recommendations were made. Most Jewish politicians were determined to be largely not responsible, with the exception being the Internal Security Ministry, Prof. Shlomo Ben-Ami. The commission recommended that he be removed from his post, and he would later become foreign minister. Also, three Arab figures (two Arab members of the Knesset and the head of the northern branch of the Islamic movement in Israel) were found to be partially responsible by incitement that preceded the riots. Background to the demonstrations The Or Commission found that Arab citizens suffer discrimination in Israel and leveled criticism at the government for failing to give fair and equal attention to the needs of Arab citizens of Israel. The commission found that frustration with discrimination led to the outpourings of frustration in October 2000. Reception The commission's report was highly controversial on all sides, both gravely disappointing the families of the victims and angering those who blamed Arab citizens for the unrest of October 2000. Arab advocacy organizations such as Adalah,Adalah reports on the Or Commission findings the Arab Association for Human Rights, and Mossawa argued that the report exonerated Jewish Israeli political figures who played a central role in mishandling the crisis around October 2000, and gave slap-on-the-wrist treatment to those who fired the shots, while severely censuring Arab political figures for incendiary speech. Some commentators believed this amounted to virtual circumvention of due process for Arab citizens. At the same time, the Or Commission's statements were perhaps the first public official acknowledgment of discrimination faced by the Arab citizenry of Israel; Adalah and Mossawa commended the Or Commission for this admission. One year after the release of the commission report, Theodore Or publicly attacked the government for failing to implement its recommendations. James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal wrote: > Yet even acknowledging that Israeli democracy is flawed, its political > system is still vastly superior to those of its adversaries. Israeli Arabs > enjoy more political and civil liberties than citizens of just about any > Arab country; and the only Arab lands that come anywhere close to being > democracies are Lebanon, Iraq and the disputed Palestinian territories‚Äîthe > last two only because of American intervention.

Approximately 300,000 attended the concert, and some anticipated that it would be a \\"Woodstock West\\".\\"Altamont Rock Festival: '60s Abruptly End\\" , Livermore Heritage Guild Journal, March/April 2010 Woodstock was held in Bethel, New York, in mid-August, less than four months earlier. The event is best known for considerable violence, including the stabbing death of Meredith Hunter and three accidental deaths: two caused by a hit-and- run car accident, and one by LSD-induced drowning in an irrigation canal. Scores were injured, numerous cars were stolen and then abandoned, and there was extensive property damage.\\"Altamont Rock Festival of 1969: The Aftermath\\" , Livermore Heritage Guild Journal, January/February 2011 The concert featured (in order of appearance): Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, with the Rolling Stones taking the stage as the final act. The Grateful Dead were also scheduled to perform following CSNY, but declined to play shortly before their scheduled appearance due to the increasing violence at the venue. \\"That's the way things went at Altamont‚Äîso badly that the Grateful Dead, prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn't even get to play,\\" staff at Rolling Stone magazine wrote in a detailed narrative on the event, terming it in an additional follow-up piece \\"rock and roll's all-time worst day, December 6th, a day when everything went perfectly wrong.\\" Filmmakers Albert and David Maysles shot footage of the event and incorporated it into the 1970 documentary film titled Gimme Shelter. Jefferson Airplane/Grateful Dead-centered background narrative According to Jefferson Airplane's Spencer Dryden, the idea for \\"a kind of Woodstock West\\" began when he and bandmate Jorma Kaukonen discussed the staging of a free concert with the Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones in Golden Gate Park. Referring to the Stones, Dryden said, \\"Next to the Beatles they were the biggest rock and roll band in the world, and we wanted them to experience what we were experiencing in San Francisco.\\" As plans were being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida, believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in Paul Kantner's account, because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of Haight-Ashbury and the police was manifested in obstructiveness. Sears Point Raceway was suggested, but its owners wanted $100,000 in escrow from the Rolling Stones. At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in Alameda County for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of Miami on December 5. Kantner said the location was taken in a spirit of desperation: \\"There was no way to control it, no supervision or order.\\" According to Grace Slick, \\"The vibes were bad. Something was very peculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. It was that kind of hazy, abrasive and unsure day. I had expected the loving vibes of Woodstock but that wasn't coming at me. This was a whole different thing.\\"Grace Slick, Biography, Barbara Rowes, pp. 155-157 Rolling Stones/Grateful Dead-centered background narrative During the Rolling Stones' 1969 U.S. tour, many (including journalists) felt that the ticket prices were far too high. In answer to this criticism, the Rolling Stones decided to end their tour with a free concert in San Francisco. The concert was originally scheduled to be held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was not in the mood for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears‚ÄìSan Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4. In making preparations, Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully and concert organizer Michael Lang helicoptered over the site before making the selection, much as Lang had done when the Woodstock Festival was moved at the last moment from Wallkill, New York, to Bethel, New York.Inside History of the Grateful Dead by Dennis McNally - Broadway (August 12, 2003) The hasty move resulted in numerous logistical problems, including a lack of facilities such as portable toilets and medical tents. The move also created a problem for the stage design; instead of being on top of a rise, which characterized the geography at Sears Point, at Altamont the stage would now be at the bottom of a slope. The Rolling Stones' stage manager on the 1969 tour, Chip Monck, explained that \\"the stage was one metre high ‚Äì 39 inches for us ‚Äì and [at Sears Point] it was on the top of a hill, so all the audience pressure was back upon them\\".Curry, David. 'Deadly Day for the Rolling Stones'. The Canberra Times. December 5, 2009. Because of the short notice for the change of location, the stage couldn't be changed. \\"We weren‚Äôt working with scaffolding, we were working in an older fashion with parallels. You could probably have put another stage below it...but nobody had one,\\" Monck said. Because the stage was so low, members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, led by Oakland chapter head Ralph \\"Sonny\\" Barger, were asked to surround the stage to provide security. Security By some accounts, the Hells Angels were hired as security by the management of the Rolling Stones, on the recommendation of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane (who both had previously used the Angels for security at performances without incident),Miller, James.Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947‚Äì1977. Simon & Schuster (1999), pp. 275‚Äì277. . for $500 worth of beer. This story has been denied by some parties who were directly involved. According to the road manager of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US Tour, Sam Cutler, \\"the only agreement there ever was ... the Angels would make sure nobody tampered with the generators, but that was the extent of it. But there was no way 'They're going to be the police force' or anything like that. That's all bollocks.\\"McNally, p. 344 The deal was made at a meeting including Cutler, Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully, and Pete Knell, a member of the Hells Angels' San Francisco chapter. According to Cutler, the arrangement was that all the bands were supposed to share the $500 beer cost, \\"[but] the person who paid it was me, and I never got it back, to this day.\\" Hells Angels member Bill \\"Sweet William\\" Fritsch recalled this exchange he had with Cutler at a meeting prior to the concert, in which Cutler had asked them to provide security: > We don't police things. We're not a security force. We go to concerts to > enjoy ourselves and have fun. Well, what about helping people out‚Äîyou know, > giving directions and things? Sure, we can do that. When Cutler asked how they would like to be paid, William replied, \\"We like beer.\\" In the documentary Gimme Shelter, Sonny Barger states that the Hells Angels were not interested in policing the event, and that organizers had told him that the Angels would be required to do little more than sit on the edge of the stage, drink beer, and make sure there were not any murders or rapes occurring. In 2009, Cutler explained his decision to use the Angels. > I was talking with them, because I was interested in the security of my > band‚Äîeveryone's security, for that matter. In the country of the blind, the > one-eyed man is king. They were the only people who were strong and > together. [They had to protect the stage] because it was descending into > absolute chaos. Who was going to stop it? Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully said that if the Angels hadn't been on the stage, > that whole crowd could have easily passed out, and rolled down onto the > stage. There was no barrier. Stefan Ponek, who hosted a December 7, 1969 KSAN-FM radio broadcast of a four- hour, \\"day after\\" post-concert telephone call-in forum (and who also helped organize the event), provided the following for the 2000 release of the Gimme Shelter DVD: > What we learned in the broadcast was pretty much startling: These guys‚Äîthe > Angels‚Äîhad been hired and paid with $500 of beer, on a truck with ice, to > essentially bring in the Stones and keep people off the stage. That was the > understanding, that was the deal. And it seemed like there was not a lot of > disagreement over that; that seemed to emerge as a fact, because it became > rather apparent that the Stones didn't know what kind of people they were > dealing with. The Gimme Shelter DVD contains extensive excerpts from that broadcast. A Hells Angels member who identified himself as \\"Pete, from Hells Angels San Francisco\\" (most likely Pete Knell, president of the San Francisco chapter), says \\"they offered us $500 worth of beer [to] go there and take care of the stage ... we took this $500 worth of beer to do it.\\" Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: \\"We were told by one of the [other Hells Angels] clubs if we showed up down there [and] sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us.\\" In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: > I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't > go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of > the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show > was over. And that's what I went there to do. A woman who called in to the program revealed that she had seen at least five fist fights from her vantage point near the stage and that the Angels were involved in all of them. She also described a general uncaring attitude toward people who clearly needed help; a girl who was dragged across the stage by her hair, another who was on a bad acid trip and bystanders kicked and walked on her. She said she felt having the Angels as \\"security\\" was an irresponsible move because \\"we were all in terror of them\\". When she tried to speak about this at the concert, she was warned to be quiet by the people around her, for fear of being beaten. At this point, KSAN's Scoop Nisker mentioned the bystander effect and the murder of Kitty Genovese.KSAN post-Altamont broadcast, December 7, 1969. 90-minute excerpt from the original four-hour broadcast, taken from the Gimme Shelter DVD, found on YouTube 2017/01/01. Emmett Grogan (founder of the radical community-action group the Diggers), who was intimately involved in the organization of the event (especially at the two earlier-planned venues), confirmed the $500 beer arrangement on that same KSAN forum with Ponek. \\"Pete\\" also tells host Ponek that the Angels were hired by Cutler because of some rowdy, anxious on-stage incidents during the Stones' Oakland and Miami concerts weeks earlier. As security guards, Pete said \\"we ain't into that security\\", but that they agreed after the beer offer. He also claimed that, other than being told to \\"just keep people off the stage,\\" Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: \\"They didn't say nothing to us about any of that.\\" And although the Angels are not security guards, \\"If we say we're going to do something, we do it. If we decide to do it, it's done. No matter what, how far we have to go to do it.\\" The similar lack of detailed security instructions by the concert's management was also mentioned by Barger during his telephone call-in. Altamont Speedway owner Dick Carter had hired hundreds of professional, plainclothes security guards, ostensibly more for the purpose of protecting his property rather than for the safety and well-being of the concertgoers. Barger mentions these guards, as identified by their wearing of \\"little white buttons\\". Political scientist and cultural critic James Miller believes that since Ken Kesey had invited the Hells Angels to one of his outdoor Acid Tests, the hippies had viewed the bikers unrealistically, idealizing them as \\"noble savages\\" and thus \\"outlaw brothers of the counterculture\\".\\"Ever since Ken Kesey had invited the motorcycle gang to one of his outdoor LSD bashes, the bikers had been widely regarded as noble savages, barbarians, perhaps, but the best imaginable guardians for the gates of Eden. And at Monterey, a splendid time was guaranteed for all,\\" James Miller, Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947‚Äì1977 (1999), 275‚Äì76. Miller also maintains that the Rolling Stones may have been misled by their experience with a British contingent of self-described \\"Hells Angels\\", a non-outlaw group of admirers of American biker gear who had provided nonviolent security at a free Stones concert earlier that year in Hyde Park, London. Cutler, however, denies ever having had any illusions about the true nature of Californian Hells Angels. \\"That's another canard foisted on the world by the press\\", he said, but Rock Scully remembers explaining to the Stones what the \\"real\\" Angels were like after watching the Hyde Park concert. Situation deteriorates The first act on the stage, Santana, gave a performance that generally went smoothly; however, over the course of the day, the mood of both the crowd and the Angels became progressively agitated and violent. The Angels had been drinking their free beer all day in front of the stage, and most were very drunk. The crowd had also become antagonistic and unpredictable, attacking each other, the Angels, and the performers. A Mick Jagger biographer, Anthony Scaduto, in Mick Jagger: Everybody's Lucifer, wrote that the only time the crowd seemed to calm down to any degree was during a set by the country-rocking Flying Burrito Brothers. By the time the Rolling Stones took the stage in the early evening, the mood had taken a decidedly ugly turn as numerous fights had erupted between Angels and crowd members and within the crowd itself. Denise Jewkes, lead singer of the local San Francisco rock band the Ace of Cups, six months pregnant, was hit in the head by an empty beer bottle thrown from the crowd and suffered a skull fracture. The Stones later paid all of Jewkes' ambulance and medical services. The Angels proceeded to arm themselves with sawed-off pool cues and motorcycle chains to drive the crowd further back from the stage. After the crowd (perhaps accidentally) toppled one of the Angels' motorcycles, the Angels became even more aggressive, including toward the performers. Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane jumped off the stage to try to sort out the problem, only to be punched in the head and knocked unconscious by an Angel during the band's set. When Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner sarcastically thanked the Angels for knocking the singer out, Angel Bill Fritsch took hold of a microphone and argued with him about it. The Grateful Dead had been scheduled to play between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and the Rolling Stones, but after hearing about the Balin incident from Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, they refused to play and left the venue, citing the quickly degenerating security situation. During Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's set, Stephen Stills was reported to be repeatedly stabbed in the leg by a \\"stoned-out\\" Hells Angel, with a sharpened bicycle spoke. The Rolling Stones waited until sundown to perform. Stanley Booth stated that part of the reason for the delay was that Bill Wyman had missed the helicopter ride to the venue. When the Stones began their set, a tightly-packed group of between 4,000 and 5,000 people were jammed to the very edge of the stage, and many attempted to climb onto it.The Capital, April 20, 1970 Death of Meredith Hunter Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger, who had already been punched in the head by a concertgoer within seconds of emerging from his helicopter, was visibly intimidated by the unruly situation and urged everyone to, \\"Just be cool down in the front there, don't push around.\\" During the third song, \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", a fight erupted in the front of the crowd at the foot of the stage, prompting the Stones to pause their set while the Angels restored order. After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of \\"Under My Thumb\\". Some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with Meredith Hunter, age 18, when he attempted to get onstage with other fans. One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter's head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd. After a minute's pause, Hunter returned to the stage where, according to Gimme Shelter producer Porter Bibb, Hunter's girlfriend Patty Bredehoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her; but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and \\"so high he could barely walk\\". Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, \\"I saw what he was looking at, that he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent. There was no doubt in my mind that he intended to do terrible harm to Mick or somebody in the Rolling Stones, or somebody on that stage.\\" Following his initial scuffle with the Angels as he tried to climb onstage, Hunter (as seen in concert footage wearing a bright lime-green suit) returned to the front of the crowd and drew a long-barreled .22 caliber revolver from inside his jacket. Hells Angel Alan Passaro, seeing Hunter drawing the revolver, drew a knife from his belt and charged Hunter from the side, parrying Hunter's pistol with his left hand and stabbing him twice with his right hand, killing him. The footage was shot by Eric Saarinen, who was on stage taking pictures of the crowd, and Baird Bryant, who climbed atop a bus. Saarinen was unaware of having caught the killing on film. This was discovered more than a week later when raw footage was screened in the New York offices of the Maysles Brothers. In the film sequence, lasting about two seconds, a two-meter (six foot) opening in the crowd appears, leaving Bredehoft in the center. Hunter enters the opening from the left. His hand rises toward the stage, and the silhouette of a revolver is clearly seen against Bredehoft's light-colored dress. Passaro is seen entering from the right and delivering two stabs with his knife as he parries Hunter's revolver and pushes him off-screen; the opening then closes around Bredehoft. Passaro was reported to have stabbed Hunter five times in the upper back, although only two stabs are visible in the footage. Witnesses also reported Hunter was stomped on by several Hells Angels while he was on the ground. The gun was recovered and turned over to police. Hunter's autopsy confirmed he was high on methamphetamine when he died. Passaro was arrested and tried for murder in the summer of 1971, but was acquitted after a jury viewed concert footage showing Hunter brandishing the revolver and concluded that Passaro had acted in self-defense. The Rolling Stones were aware of the skirmish, but not the stabbing (\\"You couldn't see anything, it was just another scuffle\\", Jagger tells David Maysles during film editing). But it soon became apparent they could see something of what had happened because the band stopped playing mid-song and Jagger was heard calling into his microphone, \\"We've really got someone hurt here... is there a doctor?\\". After a few minutes the band began playing again and eventually completed their set. Jagger told Maysles they all agreed that if they abandoned the show at that point, the crowd would have become even more unruly, perhaps degenerating into a full-scale riot. In 2003, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office initiated a two-year investigation into the possibility of a second Hells Angel having taken part in the stabbing. Finding insufficient support for this hypothesis, and reaffirming that Passaro acted alone, the office closed the case for good on May 25, 2005. Reactions The Altamont concert is often contrasted with the Woodstock festival that took place less than four months earlier. While Woodstock represented \\"peace and love\\", Altamont came to be viewed as the end of the hippie era and the de facto conclusion of late-1960s American youth culture: \\"Altamont became, whether fairly or not, a symbol for the death of the Woodstock Nation.\\" Rock music critic Robert Christgau wrote in 1972 that \\"Writers focus on Altamont not because it brought on the end of an era but because it provided such a complex metaphor for the way an era ended.\\" Writing for The New Yorker in 2015, Richard Brody argued that what Altamont ended was \\"the idea that, left to their own inclinations and stripped of the trappings of the wider social order, the young people of the new generation will somehow spontaneously create a higher, gentler, more loving grassroots order. What died at Altamont is the Rousseauian dream itself.\\"Richard Brody, \\"What Died at Altamont\\", New Yorker, March 11, 2015. The music magazine Rolling Stone, in a 14-page 11-author article on the event entitled \\"The Rolling Stones Disaster at Altamont: Let It Bleed\\" published in their January 21, 1970, issue, stated that \\"Altamont was the product of diabolical egotism, hype, ineptitude, money manipulation, and, at base, a fundamental lack of concern for humanity\\". The article covered the many issues with the event's organization and was very critical of the organizers and the Rolling Stones; one writer stated: \\"what an enormous thrill it would have been for an Angel to kick Mick Jagger's teeth down his throat.\\" Another follow-up piece in Rolling Stone called the Altamont event \\"rock and roll's all-time worst day\\". In Esquire magazine, Ralph J. Gleason observed, \\"The day The Rolling Stones played there, the name [Altamont] became etched in the minds of millions of people who love pop music and who hate it as well. If the name 'Woodstock' has come to denote the flowering of one phase of the youth culture, 'Altamont' has come to mean the end of it.\\" The film Gimme Shelter was criticized by Pauline Kael, Vincent Canby and other reviewers for portraying the Stones too sympathetically, and for staging a concert for the sole reason that it could be filmed, despite all the problems leading up to it. Salon's Michael Sragow, writing in 2000, said many of the critics took their cues from the Rolling Stone review, which heavily blamed the filmmakers for being part of a \\"staged event\\" so that the Rolling Stones could profit from making a \\"concert\\" film. Sragow pointed out numerous errors in the Rolling Stone coverage and added that the Maysles did not make \\"major motion pictures\\" in the traditional way; instead, a variety of factors contributed to the tragedy.\\"[The Maysles] relied for their effects on molding found material, not spending time and money -- which they didn‚Äôt have much of at Altamont anyway -- devising a reality 'spectacular'.\\" Michael Sragow, \\"\\"Gimme Shelter\\": The true story\\". Salon, August 10, 2000. The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards was relatively sanguine about the show, calling it \\"basically well-handled, but lots of people were tired and a few tempers got frayed\\" and \\"on the whole, a good concert.\\" The Grateful Dead wrote several songs about, or in response to, what lyricist Robert Hunter called \\"the Altamont affair\\", including \\"New Speedway Boogie\\" (featuring the line \\"One way or another, this darkness got to give\\") and \\"Mason's Children\\". Both songs were written and recorded during sessions for the early 1970 album Workingman's Dead, but \\"Mason's Children\\" was not included on the album. Altamont also inspired the Blue √ñyster Cult song \\"Transmaniacon MC\\" (\\"MC\\" means \\"motorcycle club\\"), the opening track of their first album. The incident is mentioned in the 1996 film The Cable Guy, in a scene where Jim Carrey's character Chip Douglas performs \\"Somebody to Love\\" on karaoke: \\"You might recognize this song as performed by Jefferson Airplane, in a little rockumentary called Gimme Shelter, about the Rolling Stones and their nightmare at Altamont. That night the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels had their way. Tonight, it's my turn.\\" In 2004 Australian electronic psych group Black Cab released their debut LP Altamont Diary, a concept album based on the concert and its cultural fallout. The LP featured a cover of \\"New Speedway Boogie\\". Altamont is also referenced by Don McLean in the song \\"American Pie\\" in the song's fifth verse, the majority of which contains symbols related to Altamont: \\"Jack Flash,\\" a reference to San Francisco (\\"Candlestick,\\" though that venue had nothing to do with the actual concert), (Sympathy for) \\"the Devil,\\" an enraged spectator watching something on a stage, and an \\"angel born in Hell.\\" McLean officially refused to confirm or deny the song's ties to Altamont until he sold his songwriting notes in 2015. Within the context of the song, Altamont served as the culmination of a ten-year period that had begun with the plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper in February 1959, during which \\"things (were) heading in the wrong direction\\" and life was \\"becoming less idyllic.\\" In 2008, a former FBI agent asserted that some members of the Hells Angels had conspired to murder Mick Jagger in retribution for the Rolling Stones' lack of support following the concert, and for the negative portrayal of the Angels in the Gimme Shelter film. The conspirators reportedly used a boat to approach a residence where Jagger was staying on Long Island, New York, the plot failing when the boat was nearly sunk by a storm. Jagger's spokesperson has refused to comment on the matter.

They continued appearing on Radio Free Oz, which later moved to KRLA 1110 AM and then KMET FM, through February 1969. They produced fifteen record albums and a 45 rpm single under contract to Columbia Records from 1967 through 1976,This total includes one release on Columbia's subsidiary label, Epic Records. and had three nationally syndicated radio programs: The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour [sic] in 1970 on KPPC-FM; and Dear Friends (1970‚Äì1971) and Let's Eat! (1971‚Äì1972) on KPFK. They also appeared in front of live audiences, and continued to write, perform, and record on other labels, occasionally taking sabbaticals during which they wrote or performed solo or in smaller groups. The Firesign Theatre was the brainchild of Peter Bergman, and all of its material was conceived, written, and performed by its members Bergman, Philip Proctor, Phil Austin, and David Ossman. The group's name stems from astrology, because all four were born under the three \\"fire signs\\": Aries (Austin), Leo (Proctor), and Sagittarius (Bergman and Ossman). Their popularity peaked in the early 1970s and ebbed in the Reagan Era. They experienced a revival and second wave of popularity in the 1990s and continued to write, record and perform until Bergman's death in 2012. In 1997, Entertainment Weekly ranked the Firesign Theatre among the \\"Thirty Greatest Comedy Acts of All Time\\". Their 1970 album Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers was nominated in 1971 for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation by the World Science Fiction Society, and their next album I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus received the same nomination in 1972. Later, they received nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for three of their albums: The Three Faces of Al (1984), Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death (1998), and Bride of Firesign (2001). In 2005, the US Library of Congress added Don't Crush That Dwarf to the National Recording Registry and called the group \\"the Beatles of comedy.\\" Before Firesign Peter Bergman and Philip Proctor met while attending Yale University in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with Austin Pendleton in 1958 on two Yale Dramat musicals in which Proctor starred: Tom Jones, and Booth Is Back In Town. In 1965, Bergman spent a year working in England on the BBC television program Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life and went to see surrealist comedian Spike Milligan in a play. Bergman went backstage and struck up a friendship with Milligan. Also that year, he saw the Beatles in concert, which gave him the inspiration to form a four-man comedy group. On returning to the US, Bergman started a late-night listener-participation talk show, Radio Free Oz, on July 24, 1966, on listener-sponsored KPFK FM in Los Angeles, working with producers Phil Austin and David Ossman. According to Austin, the show \\"featured everybody who was anybody in the artistic world who passed through LA.\\" Guests included the band Buffalo Springfield and Andy Warhol. In November, Proctor was in Los Angeles looking for acting work and watching the Sunset Strip curfew riots. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for his comedy group. Bergman originally named the group the \\"Oz Firesign Theatre\\" because all four were born under the three astrological fire signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius), and the group debuted on his November 17, 1966 show. Bergman had to drop \\"Oz\\" from the name after legal threats from Disney and MGM, who owned movie rights to The Wizard of Oz and other associated works. Radio Free Oz The Firesigns initially chose an improvisational style and carried it to a level which revolutionized radio comedy. According to Proctor: On nights when he had no guests, Bergman would have the Firesigns come on the air and pretend (including himself) to be outrageously interesting guests. On their November 17, 1966 debut, they pretended to be the panel of an imaginary \\"Oz Film Festival\\": Bergman was film critic Peter Volta, \\"writing a history of world cinema one frame at a time\\"; Ossman was Raul Saez, maker of ‚Äúthrown camera‚Äù films, who had just won a grant to roll a 70 mm film camera down the Andes mountains; Austin was Jack Love, making \\"Living Room Theatre\\" porn films like The Nun and Blondie Pays the Rent; and Proctor was Jean-Claude Jean-Claude, creator of the \\"Nouvelle Nouvelle Vague Vague movement\\" and director of a documentary Two Weeks With Fred, which lasts a full two weeks. By 1967, Bergman had the Firesign Theatre appear regularly on Radio Free Oz. The Firesigns were strongly influenced by the British Goon Show; Proctor, Austin, and Ossman were big fans since the NBC program Monitor broadcast Goon Show episodes in the late 1950s, and Bergman became a fan after forming the Firesigns. According to Ossman: In the fall of 1967, the Firesign Theatre was broadcasting Sunday nights from The Magic Mushroom, in Studio City, formerly a Bob Eubanks' Cinnamon Cinder. In September 1967, they performed an adaptation of Jorge Luis Borges' short story \\"La Muerte y La Brujula\\" (\\"Death and the Compass\\") on Radio Free Oz. In 1969, they created a number of improvised television commercials for Jack Poet Volkswagen in Highland Park, California, with the characters of Christian Cyborg (Bergman), Coco Lewis (Proctor), Bob Chicken (Austin), and Tony Gomez (Ossman). Golden age Early recording career Bergman coined the term \\"love-in\\" in 1967, and he promoted the first Los Angeles Love-In, attended by 40,000 in Elysian Park, on his program. The Firesigns performed there, which led to Radio Free Oz moving to KRLA 1110 AM, which had a much wider audience than KPFK FM. This event also caught the attention of Columbia Records staff producer Gary Usher, who sensed commercial potential for the Firesign Theatre and proposed to Bergman they make a \\"love- In album\\" for Columbia. Bergman countered with a proposal for a Firesign Theatre album, and this led to a five-yearAccording to Ossman's Martian Space Party Diary, Columbia signed the Firesigns to a second five-year contract on March 9, 1972. recording contract with the label. Usher also used the Firesigns' audio collages on songs by The Byrds (\\"Draft Morning\\") and Sagittarius (the 45 RPM version of \\"Hotel Indiscreet\\") in 1967 and 1968. The album was given the non sequitur title Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him, from Bergman's undeveloped 1965 idea for a comic film. The Firesigns changed their improvisational style, producing tightly scripted and memorized material. According to Bergman: \\"There was no leader.\\" The Firesigns always billed themselves alphabetically on their album jackets and other printed materials. \\"Everything was communally written, and if one person didn't agree about something, no matter how strongly the other three felt about it, it didn't go in.\\" The resulting synergy created the feeling of a fifth Firesign; according to Austin: \\"It's like, suddenly there is this fifth guy that actually does the writing. We all vaguely sort of know him, and a lot of the time take credit for him.\\" This resulted in the group inventing the name \\"4 or 5 Krazy Guys Publishing\\" to copyright their work. Their contract with Columbia, in exchange for a low royalty rate, gave them unlimited studio time, allowing them to perfect their writing and recording. Electrician revolutionized the concept of the comedy album: it consists of four radio plays. Side one is a trilogy of pieces: starting with \\"Temporarily Humboldt County\\", a satire of the Europeans' displacement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas; followed by \\"W. C. Fields Forever\\", a satire of the 1960s hippie culture; leading into \\"Trente-Huit Cunegonde (Returned for Regrooving)\\", a projected future in which the roles of the hippie counterculture and the Establishment culture are reversed. Side two, the title track, is a stream-of- consciousness play about an American tourist to an Eastern Bloc country (Proctor), who ends up in prison and is rescued by the CIA. It was recorded in CBS's Los Angeles radio studio from which The Jack Benny Program and others had been broadcast; the original RCA microphones and sound effects devices were used. It was released in January 1968, selling a modest 12,000 copies in its first year. The Firesigns continued to work on the radio and began performing in folk clubs such as the Ash Grove. Radio Free Oz moved again to KMET FM until February 1969. The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour aired for two hours on Sunday nights on KPPC-FM in 1970. They concentrated their writing on the folk-club material and produced improvisational skit material for the Radio Hour and its successors. The Firesigns almost lost their recording contract after their first album. According to Bergman: \\"Columbia was going to kick us off the label, so we scripted the next record and the old guard at Columbia took a look at the script and said 'This isn't funny‚Äîthis is dirty!' And to our rescue came James William Guercio [producer of the Buckinghams] and John Hammond.\\" Austin says, \\"With Hammond backing us up, CBS came around.\\" They went on to produce three more Columbia studio albums from 1969 to 1971. Each grew technically more sophisticated, taking advantage of up to 16 tape tracks and Dolby noise reduction by 1970. How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All, released in 1969, consists of a stream-of- consciousness play on side one about a man named Babe (Bergman) who buys a car and goes on a road trip that turns into a parody of Norman Corwin's 1941 patriotic radio pageant We Hold These Truths.CD Liner Notes by David Ossman Side two, The Further Adventures of Nick Danger, is a parody of 1940s radio, about a hard-boiled detective (Austin) who became possibly the Firesigns' most famous character. Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers (1970) is a single play centered around an actor named George Tirebiter (Ossman), who gradually ages into an old man while watching his old movies on television: a Henry Aldrich parody High School Madness (in which he is named Porgie Tirebiter), and the Korean War film Parallel Hell. Dwarf marked a high point in the Firesign's use of blue comedy: Porgie has explicit sex with the Negro housemaid as creaking bedsprings are heard. This album was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1971 by the World Science Fiction Society, Dwarf brought a level of success to the Firesigns that started to spoil them. Bergman said, \\"We toured after Dwarf and we began to realize the extent we were influencing people. We realized that FM radio was playing our albums whole, and that people were memorizing them.\\" Austin said of this period, \\"At that point we began not to get along with each other that well, and the being taken so seriously ‚Äî- Rolling Stone did a long article on us, and we were being compared to James Joyce ‚Äî- there was a prideful attitude that took over. But we weren't making money; we might as well have been teaching school somewhere and worrying about making tenure for all the money we were making. So in some sense we didn't really understand what we were doing, which is why we were never able to make a second Dwarf, which to me is a real disappointment.\\" Their fourth album, I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus (1971), also a single play, centers on a young, early-technology computer hacker (Proctor) and an older \\"bozo\\" with a large nose that honks like a clown's (Austin), who attend a Disneyesque Future Fair. The blue comedy was dialed back from explicit to suggestive, as a scientist invents a machine that mimics sexual intercourse. This album also received a Hugo nomination in 1972. Meanwhile, from September 9, 1970 to February 17, 1971, they were performing a one-hour weekly live series on KPFK, Dear Friends. These programs were recorded and then edited into slightly shorter shows and syndicated to radio stations across the country on 12\\" LP albums. Their fifth album, Dear Friends, was a double-record compilation of what they considered the best segments from the series, released in January 1972. Dear Friends was followed with the KPFK show Let's Eat! in 1971 and 1972. Both titles came from lines uttered by televangelist Pastor Rod Flash (Proctor) on his \\"Hour of Reckoning\\" program in Don't Crush That Dwarf. In 1970, the group had performed a live stage show, the Shakespeare parody The Count of Monte Cristo, at Columbia University. In January 1972 they decided to expand this and retitle it Anything You Want To for their next album. On March 9, Columbia signed them to a second five-year contract. On March 30, they ended Let's Eat! with a live broadcast titled Martian Space Party, which was also recorded on 16-track tape and filmed. The Firesigns combined parts of the two shows with some new studio material to produce their sixth album Not Insane or Anything You Want To. But before releasing the album in October 1972, they had discarded their original story line idea and some newly written scenes. 1973 split Proctor and Bergman started working as a duo in 1973 on TV or Not TV. The Not Insane album performed poorly, and the Firesigns later claimed to be disappointed with it. In the liner notes to the group‚Äôs 1993 greatest hits album, Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre, Bergman criticized Not Insane, saying it \\"was when the Firesign was splitting apart; it was a fractious, fragmented album.\\" Ossman called it \\"a serious mistake\\" and said it ‚Äúwas incomprehensible, basically‚Äù, and ‚Äúit was not the album it should have been and I think that caused us to slope off rapidly in sales.\\" The four decided to take a break from the group in 1973 to work in separate directions. Proctor and Bergman decided to perform as a duo, and made a separate record deal with Columbia, producing TV or Not TV: A Video Vaudeville in Two Acts. The record predicts the rise of pay cable TV, and it depicts an amateur station run by two men who must constantly block a group of teenage hijackers. They turned this into a vaudeville-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey Wolfman Jack. Meanwhile, Ossman wrote a solo album How Time Flys, based on the Mark Time astronaut character he created for a Dear Friends skit, used on I Think We're All Bozos and cut from Not Insane. He co-directed the album with Columbia producer Steve Gillmor, and the other three Firesigns starred on it, along with several guest personalities including Wolfman Jack, Harry Shearer of The Credibility Gap, and broadcast journalist Lew Irwin. Mark returns on New Year's Eve, 1999, from a twenty-year round trip to Planet X, only to find the space program has been dismantled, and no one cares about him except for an eccentric impresario (Bergman) who kidnaps him for his video recordings of encounters with alien life. Austin wrote the solo album Roller Maidens From Outer Space, based on a hardboiled detective in the same vein as his Nick Danger character introduced on the B side of How Can You Be In Two Places.... Roller Maidens, released in March 1974 on Columbia's Epic label, also featured all four Firesigns and included actors Richard Paul and Michael C. Gwynne. The album satirizes series television, televangelists, the 1973 oil crisis, and the Presidency of Richard Nixon. Comedy style The Firesigns made use of inside humor. They peppered Waiting for the Electrician and How Can You Be in Two Places At Once with Beatles references not found on the band's top 40 material. Firesign characters quoted lyrics from songs such as \\"The Word\\" and \\"I'm So Tired\\". The name of Danger's criminal nemesis Rocky Rococo was a parody of the Beatles' \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", and Danger's girlfriend has multiple names but \\"everyone knew her as Nancy\\" just like Rocky Raccoon's girlfriend. Later the Firesigns created their own inside jokes by referring to their own previously released material. A famous example is when a confused caller tries to order a pizza from Nick Danger; the other side of this phone conversation is portrayed in Dwarf, where George Tirebiter is the frustrated, hungry caller trying to get food delivered from \\"Nick's\\". \\"He's no fun, he fell right over\\" became a famous catchphrase delivered by Austin in \\"How Can You Be In Two Places at Once\\" and repeated on side two in \\"The Further Adventures of Nick Danger\\". This line was repeated on the albums Not Insane and How Time Flys. Reunion The group reunited in late August 1973 to produce the Sherlock Holmes parody The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra, based on one of the plays from their 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, By the Light of the Silvery. This was released on vinyl in January 1974. The Firesigns sold this script to science fiction writer Harlan Ellison for Book Three of Ellison's anthology The Last Dangerous Visions, which Ellison never completed. In October 1974, the Firesigns released their seventh album Everything You Know Is Wrong, which satirized the developing New Age movement. Ossman said this record \\"grew out of our basic interest in those parapsychological things ... from Castaneda to the hollow Earth theory to the guy who bends spoons. Originally, when we started writing it, it was going to be a much more complicated and 'cinematic' record; we were trying to write a radio movie.\\" The Firesigns produced a film made by Allen Daviau (who later filmed E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) using the album as the soundtrack. The film was shown in a live appearance at Stanford University and released on VHS video tape in 1993. In 1975, they released the black comedy album In the Next World, You're on Your Own, written by Austin and Ossman. The story centers on an alcoholic dirty cop (Proctor), whose son (Bergman) is a by-the-book cop, whose daughter (Proctor) is a porn actress, and whose wife (Ossman) lives in a soap opera. In a parody of Marlon Brando's 1973 Academy Awards protest, the brother and sister stage a terrorist attack on an Oscar awards ceremony. This album, like Not Insane, also sold poorly, and Columbia declined to offer them a third contract in 1976. This time, the Firesigns didn't protest. Bergman said, \\"The group had really split apart; we had just burned out. I mean it was five years non-stop work. We would stop one album and start writing the next. Frankly, we didn't have five more albums in us at that point.\\" Second split As Austin looked back on this period from September 1993, he wrote that he saw Proctor and Bergman wanting to take the Firesign Theatre in a different direction than he did, moving away from intensely written albums released one per year, to more live performances with lighter material. Proctor and Bergman turned their attention in 1975 to producing a live show recorded on the Columbia album What This Country Needs, based in part on material from TV or Not TV and named for a song added to the show. The Firesign Theatre closed out their Columbia Records contract with a greatest-hits compilation Forward Into the Past in 1976. Meanwhile, Austin and Ossman toured the west coast, billing themselves as \\"Dr. Firesign's Theatre of Mystery\\". They produced a live stage show Radio Laffs of 1940, which included a second episode of the private eye character Nick Danger, \\"School For Actors\\"; and a soap opera \\"Over the Edge\\". This was performed at the Los Feliz Theatre in Los Angeles in May 1976 and at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco in June. Austin wrote in 1993 that this tour \\"was meant to be an antidote to confusion but ... had not turned out to be much fun at all\\". The Firesigns took it easy for the rest of the 1970s, producing a 1977 album Just Folks... A Firesign Chat based largely on unreleased Dear Friends and Let's Eat radio material. Proctor and Bergman appeared as regulars on a 1977 summer replacement TV series hosted by the Starland Vocal Band. Proctor and Bergman gave up their road performances after witnessing the September 4, 1977 Golden Dragon Massacre, and in 1978 released another studio album Give Us a Break, which lampooned radio and television. The Starland Vocal Band also performed short comic radio breaks on this album. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin's Tandem Productions bought the rights to Nick Danger for a TV series to star George Hamilton; and in 1978, New Line Cinema began negotiations to make a movie starring Chevy Chase. Both projects ended in development hell, and rights to the character reverted to the Firesigns. In December 1978, they began writing five short (2:24) episodes of Nick Danger: The Case of the Missing Shoe for a possible syndicated daily radio series. When the syndication went unsold, Austin approached Rhino Records and secured a deal to release the five episodes in 1979 on a 12-minute extended play (EP) record. Meanwhile, Proctor and Bergman produced a film, J-Men Forever, using clips from old Republic Pictures movie serials with dubbed dialogue, combined with new footage of them as FBI agents tracking down a villain known as \\"the Lightning Bug\\" voiced by disk jockey M. G. Kelly. This became popular on the 1980s late-night TV series Night Flight. Austin called Bergman in late 1979 to make peace and reunite the Firesigns. This resulted in a series of shows performed at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles: \\"The Owl and the Octopus Show\\"; \\"The Joey Demographico Show\\"; \\"Nick Danger: Men in Hats\\"; and \\"Welcome to Billville\\". These included songs with music written by Austin, and were recorded; the live recordings were used to produce their last album of the decade, the 1980 Fighting Clowns. They also produced a show, \\"Presidents in Hell\\" (FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, and Nixon), which was not recorded. Reagan Era The popularity of the group cooled off after 1980 as the social and political climate of the United States changed with the election of President Ronald Reagan. In 1982, they produced the album Lawyer's Hospital from a collection of live appearances, National Public Radio (NPR) performances, and the Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials from Radio Free Oz. They also expanded their 1972 Shakespeare parody into a road show, Shakespeare's Lost Comedie and released it on a 1982 vinyl LP, which required editing down; it was re-released uncut on CD in 2001, retitled Anythynge You Want To. Ossman left the group in early 1982 to take a producer's job for NPR in Washington DC. The remaining three Firesigns produced a new album in 1984, The Three Faces of Al, with the further adventures of Nick Danger. This received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, and was followed in 1985 with the album Eat or Be Eaten, about a character trapped in an interactive video game. In 1988, Austin was signed by John Dryden to produce over 50 short Nick Danger pieces for his radio satire show The Daily Feed. These were published on cassette tape as The Daily Feed Tapes, and later formed the basis for a 1995 book authored by Austin, Tales of the Old Detective and Other Big Fat Lies. In the summer of 1990, NPR producer Ted Bonnitt called Proctor and asked him if he wanted to contribute some comedy material to Bonnitt's nightly program HEAT with John Hockenberry. Proctor called Bergman, and the duo agreed to write and perform a serial consisting of 13 five-minute episodes, Power: Life on the Edge in L.A. 1990s revival Following the 1992 United States presidential election, and with Ossman back in the group, the Firesign Theatre reunited in 1993 for a 25th anniversary reunion tour around the US, Back From the Shadows, starting on April 24 in Seattle with an audience of 2,900. The title was taken from a parody of the Gene Autry song \\"Back in the Saddle Again\\", which they wrote for I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus. The tour, consisting of live performances of material adapted from their first four Golden Age albums (Electrician, Two Places At Once, Dwarf, and Bozos), was recorded on CD and a DVD video released in 1994. They also released a 1993 greatest hits album, Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre containing original material from the first nine albums, TV or Not TV, and Roller Maidens From Outer Space. In 1996, Bergman revived Radio Free Oz as an Internet-based radio station, www.rfo.net, calling it \\"the Internet's funny bone.\\"PeterBergman; Filmkauai.com The Firesigns followed this with the 1998 album Pink Hotel Burns Down, a collection of material from two 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, Exorcism In Your Daily Life and their early Sherlock Holmes parody \\"By the Light of the Silvery\\"; two cuts, \\"The Pink Hotel\\" and \\"The Sand Bar\\" from their video game record that eventually became Eat or Be Eaten; the soap opera \\"Over the Edge\\" from Austin and Ossman's 1976 Dr. Firesign's Theatre of Mystery tour, and several clips from their radio work, including the earliest recorded appearance on Radio Free Oz. The Firesigns satirized the turn-of-the-millennium Y2K scare with the 1998 album Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death, in which they revived some of their classic characters such as used car salesman Ralph Spoilsport (Proctor) from How Can You Be In Two Places At Once, news reporters Harold Hiphugger (Ossman) and Ray Hamberger (Proctor) from Everything You Know Is Wrong, and game-show contestant Caroline Presskey (Proctor) from Don't Crush That Dwarf. This earned them their second Grammy nomination, and they developed it into a \\"millennium trilogy\\" with the 1999 Boom Dot Bust and 2001 Bride of Firesign, which received a third Grammy nomination. Boom Dot Bust used material from their 1979 Roxy show \\"Welcome to Billville\\". They created a live show, Radio Now Live in 2001 using characters from Give Me Immortality and released it on a live album, which also includes updated cuts from Anythynge You Want To. In December 2001, the Firesigns appeared in a 90-minute PBS television show Weirdly Cool. This contained live, updated performance material based on Waiting for the Electrician, How Can You Be in Two Places..., and Don't Crush That Dwarf; and included interviews and two Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials. From November 2002 through early 2003, Bergman produced a political satire series True Confessions of the Real World, three times weekly on Pasadena non- commercial KPCC FM. He scripted fake interviews with imaginary \\"newsmakers\\". The Firesigns appeared on the NPR show All Things Considered on US holidays from July 4 to December 31, 2002; these were compiled on a CD, All Things Firesign. They also appeared for President's Day on February 17, 2003, and Saint Patrick's Day on March 17, 2003. Austin, Ossman, and Proctor pay tribute to Peter Bergman on April 21, 2012 In 2008, they released a four-CD boxed set The Firesign Theatre's Box of Danger, compiling most material which featured their most famous character, Nick Danger, including a bootleg recording of a 1976 live performance. Their final album was the 2010 Duke of Madness Motors: The Complete \\"Dear Friends\\" Radio Era, a combination book and data DVD comprising a complete compilation, totaling over 80 hours, of their 1970s radio shows Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour, Dear Friends, and Let's Eat (the last two in both original broadcast, and syndication-edited form). Their last live performance as a quartet was on December 10, 2011 in Portland, Oregon. They could claim to be the longest surviving group from the \\"classic rock\\" era to still be intact with the original members (45 years). Bergman died in a Santa Monica hospital on March 9, 2012, from complications involving leukemia. According to Austin, the remaining three Firesigns' April 21, 2012 memorial for Bergman was their last live performance. Austin died in Fox Island, Washington, on June 18, 2015, from complications of cancer. Firesign members upright=0.35 Peter Bergman (born under the fire sign Sagittarius in Cleveland, Ohio on November 29, 1939; died March 9, 2012) started his radio career on his high school radio system during the Korean War; he got kicked off the air by the principal when, as a prank, he announced a Communist takeover of the school. He studied economics at Yale (class of 1961) and was managing editor of the university's comedy magazine. In his second graduate year he became a fellow in playwriting. As a member of the Yale Dramatic Association, he co-wrote two musical comedies with Austin Pendleton. Later, he considered attending medical school and helped produce a machine for viewing angio cardiograms and measuring blockage of the arteries of the heart. He had a deep voice and frequently took African American roles in Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works. upright=0.35 Philip Proctor (born under the fire sign Leo in Goshen, Indiana on July 28, 1940) was a boy soprano in a children's choir and studied acting at Yale. There, he met his future partner Bergman in the Yale Dramatic Association, where he starred in the two musical comedies written by Bergman and Pendleton. He became a professional actor, with a role on the soap opera The Edge of Night, before contacting Bergman and joining him on Radio Free Oz in 1966. Proctor's adult tenor voice enables him to do a convincing female voice without using falsetto; therefore he usually did most of the female roles in the Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works, though the other three Firesigns occasionally did female voices. He also has done celebrity voice impersonations on Firesign material, including W.C. Fields (Waiting For the Electrician and How Can You Be In Two Places...), Robert F. Kennedy (Waiting For the Electrician), and a Peter Lorre-like voice for the Nick Danger character Rocky Rococo (Box of Danger). Proctor has also acted and appeared as a voice actor on many television shows and several feature films. upright=0.6 Phil Austin (born under the fire sign Aries in Denver, Colorado on April 6, 1941; died June 18, 2015), was the youngest Firesign. He attended college but never graduated. He was an accomplished lead guitarist, and he was responsible for adding much of the music to Firesign works. He also appeared as an actor and voice actor on television. He used his natural, sonorous baritone voice for Nick Danger, but affected a phony Japanese accent for his \\"Young Guy, Motor Detective\\" self-parody of Danger in Not Insane and a stereotypical, tough-guy voice and accent for the similar hardboiled detective Dick Private in Roller Maidens From Outer Space. He also could do an old-man voice as Doc Technical in the Dear Friends radio \\"Mark Time\\" episode, and he applied his impersonation of Richard Nixon as presidents in several Firesign and solo works (Bozos, How Time Flys, Roller Maidens, and Everything You Know Is Wrong). He also did an Elvis Presley impersonation singing the news in the Roller Maidens track \\"The Bad News\\". upright=0.6 David Ossman (born under the fire sign Sagittarius in Santa Monica, California on December 6, 1936), the oldest Firesign, is known as the intellectual of the group, and he is known for doing an old-man voice (most famously as Catherwood the butler in the original Nick Danger story, George Tirebiter on Don't Crush That Dwarf and In the Next World You're On Your Own, and as the elder ant Cornelius in Disney Pixar's 1998 A Bug's Life.) He used his natural voice as astronaut Mark Time and newsman Harold Hiphugger. Outside of the Firesign Theatre, he has performed several voices on The Tick animated TV series and worked extensively as a producer and on-air narrator on National Public Radio and several affiliated stations. Associate Firesigns Several people have been accorded unofficial \\"associate Firesign\\" status over the years, by virtue of performing on several records with the group. Austin's first wife Annalee performed in support of the group on several golden age albums. She is credited as a member of \\"the St. Louis Aquarium Choraleers\\" (singing the hymn \\"Marching to Shibboleth\\") and as \\"the Wake-Up Lady\\" and for birdsong on Don't Crush That Dwarf; as \\"Mickey\\" and with keyboard stylings on I Think We're All Bozos; with film footage on the Dear Friends album; and organ, piano, and vocals on Not Insane. Ossman's first wife Tiny (Tinika) performed as a St. Louis Aquarium Choraleer and as part of the \\"Ambient's Noyes Choral\\" (singing the Peorgie and Mudhead theme song) on Don't Crush That Dwarf; as \\"Ann\\" on I Think We're All Bozos; as Nurse Angela and news reporter Chiquita Bandana on How Time Flys; and vocals and percussion on Not Insane. She and Ossman co- hosted a Sunday night radio program of pre‚ÄìWorld War II music on KTYD. Austin married his second wife Oona in 1971. She is credited as an anonymous extra in I Think We're All Bozos; was photographed as one of the Roller Maidens From Outer Space and sang backup vocals for the Austin solo album; and appeared as a Reebus Caneebus groupie in the film version of Everything You Know Is Wrong. She is the model for the blonde femme fatale on the cover art of the Box of Danger CD set, and is credited with performing support functions such as photography and catering on several of the later albums. Proctor's third wife, actress Melinda Peterson, appeared with Proctor and Bergman on their 1990 NPR serial Power: Life on the Edge in L.A.. She also performed on the Give Me Immortality ..., Boom Dot Bust, and Bride of Firesign albums and supported the group in the Radio Now Live show.

In 2005, the US Library of Congress added Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers to the National Recording Registry, and called the group \\"the Beatles of comedy.\\" Comedians George Carlin, Robin Williams, and John Goodman enjoyed the Firesigns' comedy and lent their comments to the 2001 PBS television special Weirdly Cool. Williams referred to Firesign albums as \\"the audio equivalent of a Hieronymus Bosch painting.\\" Beatle John Lennon was photographed wearing the Firesign's \\"Not Insane ‚Äì Papoon for President\\" campaign button they had made for Martian Space Party (Not Insane album). Musical satirist \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic paid homage to the Firesigns by giving the title \\"Everything You Know Is Wrong\\" to an original song on his 1996 album Bad Hair Day. Steve Jobs paid homage to the Firesigns' I Think We're All Bozos album by programming an \\"Easter egg\\" in Apple's Siri intelligent personal assistant. Siri responds to the prompt \\"This is worker speaking. Hello\\" with \\"Hello Ah-Clem. What function can I perform for you? LOL\\". On several occurrences of the Association for Consciousness Exploration (ACE)'s Starwood Festival, director Jeff Rosenbaum has organized performances of Firesign Theatre radio plays performed by organizers and guest speakers of the event under the name \\"Firesign Clones\\". Copyright infringement In Madison, Wisconsin in 1974, a pair of University of Illinois students opened the first of a regional chain of pizza restaurants they named \\"Rocky Rococo\\" after the Nick Danger character, without any mention of connection to the Firesign Theatre. They hired an artist to design, as their logo, a moustachioed Italian with a white hat and sunglasses, suggested by the White Spy from Mad Magazine, and hired comic actor Jim Pederson to portray this \\"Rocky Rococo\\" wearing a white suit. The Firesigns visited the first Rocky Rococo Pizza when on tour in Madison in 1975 and reacted with good humor, joking around with the owners and giving them pictures that said, \\"To Rocky, from Rocky\\" which were hung on the wall. But in 1985, by which time the chain had grown to 62 restaurants and the Firesigns had passed their \\"golden age\\", they sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. The pizza chain's lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan's ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian. Since the creator of the Conan the Barbarian comic had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, so the Firesigns settled out of court. Mark Time awards Ossman and his second wife Judith Walcutt formed Otherworld Media Productions in 1985 to produce audio theatre. They created an annual \\"Mark Time award\\" for best radio science fiction, named after Ossman's astronaut character. In 2015, they added three new awards named after Firesign Theatre characters: *Nick Danger prize for best mystery/detective fiction *The Bradshaw prize (after Bergman's cop character) for \\"service to the field\\" *The Betty Jo (But Everyone Knew Her as Nancy) prize, judged by Phil Proctor and his wife, for best \\"multi-gender\\" vocal performance Media Radio *Radio Free Oz (1966‚Äì1969) *The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour (1970) *Dear Friends (1970‚Äì1971) Syndicated *Let's Eat (1971‚Äì1972) Syndicated *A Firesign Chat with Papoon (1972 Columbia) *The Proctor-Bergman Report (1977‚Äì1978) *The Cassette Chronicles (1980 Rhino Entertainment) A six-cassette collection of the Firesign Theatre's presidential and campaign commentaries which aired on NPR during the 1980 election season. *Daily Feed 1988 Newsreel ‚Äî The Daily Feed (1988, DC Audio) A solo cassette by Austin *A Capital Decade Daily Feed 1989 Newsreel ‚Äî The Daily Feed (1989 DC Audio) A solo cassette by Austin *Power: Life on the Edge in L.A.

Enoshima Shrine Iwaya Caves is a small offshore island, about in circumference, at the mouth of the Katase River which flows into the Sagami Bay of Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Administratively, Enoshima is part of the mainland city of Fujisawa, and is linked to the Katase section of that city by a bridge. Home to some of the closest sandy beaches to Tokyo and Yokohama, the island and adjacent coastline are the hub of a local resort area. History Classical era Benzaiten, the goddess of music and entertainment, is enshrined on the island. The island in its entirety is dedicated to the goddess, who is said to have caused it to rise from the bottom of the sea in the sixth century.Papinot (1972:82) The island is the scene of the Enoshima Engi, a history of shrines on Enoshima written by the Japanese Buddhist monk K≈çkei in 1047 AD. Modern era In 1880, after the Shinto and Buddhism separation order of the new Meiji government had made the land available, much of the uplands was purchased by Samuel Cocking, a British merchant, in his Japanese wife's name. He developed a power plant and extensive botanical gardens including a very large greenhouse. Although the original greenhouse was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, the botanical garden (now the Samuel Cocking Garden) remains an attraction with over half a million visitors a year.

It is part of the City University of New York system. Its 80-acre campus is located in the Kew Gardens Hills section of Queens with a student body that represents over 170 countries. Queens College was established in 1937 and offers undergraduate degrees in over 70 majors, graduate studies in over 100 degree programs and certificates, over 40 accelerated master's options, 20 doctoral degrees through the CUNY Graduate Center, and a number of advanced certificate programs. Alumni and faculty of the school, such as Arturo O'Farrill and Jerry Seinfeld, have received over 100 Grammy Award nominations. The college is organized into seven schools: Aaron Copland School of Music, Graduate School of Library and Information Studies, School of Arts & Humanities, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, School of Education, School of Math and Natural Sciences, and School of Social Sciences. Queens College competes in Division II of the NCAA and sponsors 15 men's and women's championship-eligible varsity teams. History Before 1937 The steps of Jefferson Hall, which was the site of the New York Parental School before it closed in 1934. Before Queens College was established in 1937, the site of the campus was home to the Jamaica Academy, a one-room schoolhouse built in the early 19th century, where Walt Whitman once worked as teacher. The building was located on Flushing-Jamaica Road (later renamed Kissena Boulevard). Jamaica Academy became public in 1844. In 1909, the New York Parental School, a home for troubled boys, opened on the land surrounding the future site of Queens College and incorporated Jamaica Academy on its campus. Buildings such as Jefferson Hall (named after Thomas Jefferson) were used as both dormitories and classrooms. In 1934, the New York Parental School was investigated amid rumors of abuse. The school was shut down and students were transferred to local public schools. A few months later, the grounds were turned over to the city. The city planned to house 500 mental patients from Randall's Island Hospital, who were temporarily displaced by the construction of the Triborough Bridge. Founding This marker, just outside the Student Union building, marks the original location of the one-room schoolhouse. Meanwhile, County Judge Charles S. Colden appointed and chaired a committee to assess the feasibility of opening a free college in Queens. In September 1935, the committee recommended the establishment of such a college. Mayor La Guardia backed the recommendation and pushed for the free college's creation. In March 1937, the Board of Education designated the site of the former Parental School to be the future location of Queens College. Paul Klapper, former dean of the School of Education at City College of New York, was appointed the new college's president. The college opened in October 1937‚Äîlater than anticipated due to a painters' strike‚Äîwith 21 members on its teaching staff and 400 students in its inaugural freshmen class. The school's colors of blue and silver were selected by a \\"Color Committee\\" drawn from the entering class of students, and were announced at the first school dance, which was held on Wednesday, November 24, 1937. Around 1,200 students enlisted in the American military during World War II; fifty-nine would be killed in action.  Late 20th century  The college campus grew as buildings were constructed and enrollment increased. But changes beyond growth were in store for Queens College: in 1970, CUNY adopted the controversial policy of Open Admissions, which guaranteed a place at CUNY for any high school graduate in New York, regardless of traditional criteria like grades or test scores. The program was intended to offer college education to more New York City residents, in particular those of color. But Open Admissions did not seem to affect Queens College as much as it did other schools ‚Äî a year after its implementation, only 10% of its student body was black or Puerto Rican, according to the newly appointed college president, Dr. Joseph S. Murphy. In 1973 enrollment at Queens reached an all-time high of 31,413 students. By 1976 new concerns overtook the college as New York City faced a crippling financial crisis. CUNY's policy of free tuition was revoked; the overall CUNY budget was cut by $135 million; and CUNY Chancellor Robert Kibbee demanded that Queens College slash its budget by 15%. Some faculty members resigned in protest. The New York Times reported in December 1976 that \\"Queens College, considered the jewel in the university's crown, has been particularly hard hit by the cuts, which have gone to the heart of the faculty.\\" All hiring and building on campus was halted. By 1984 student enrollment had declined to 15,000. But with a $175 million building program in place by 1986 for the college's 50th anniversary, enrollments were expected to rise and the college was beginning to recover from the financial crisis of the 1970s. In addition, the student body, in accordance with the mission of the short-lived Open Admissions program, had grown much more diverse, and college faculty were trained to understand Latin American culture and how to teach American literature to non- native students. By that time, former Queens College president Dr. Joseph S. Murphy was CUNY Chancellor. In the 1990s, the college attracted high-profile researchers to its faculty, including the virologist Luc Montagnier. Under President Allen Lee Sessoms, the college underwent some growth but also some missteps, including the highly publicized inability to fund the planned AIDS research center that Dr. Montagnier had been hired to lead. Involvement in the Civil Rights Movement Queens College students were active participants in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. The most well-known student activist was Andrew Goodman, who was slain in Mississippi in 1964 with two other young men, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner; all three were trying to register African Americans to vote in the South. Schwerner and Chaney were on the organizing staff of CORE; Goodman was a Freedom Summer volunteer. The three activists were stopped and arrested for allegedly driving over the speed limit on a Mississippi road. After being brought into the sheriff's department and released, the three young men were stopped by two carloads of Ku Klux Klan members on a remote rural road. The men approached their car, then shot and killed all three young men. The murders received national attention, and six conspirators were brought to trial and convicted by federal prosecutors for civil rights violations. The Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower of Rosenthal Library, a highly visible borough landmark, is named in their honor. In February 2011, Queens College inherited the personal collection of the late James Forman. The collection, along with other civil rights leaders' collections, is available online at the Queens College Civil Rights Archive. A special program on February 17, 2011 included a presentation by the Honorable Julian Bond for Black History Month, as well as a formal announcement of the acquisition. 21st century The college campus continued improving its facilities. Under a $1 billion CUNY-wide improvement program, Queens College's Powdermaker Hall was given a $57 million renovation, begun in 2000. By 2014 enrollment was 20,000 students, half of whom come from minority backgrounds. Dr. Felix V. Matos Rodriguez was appointed president of Queens College by the CUNY Board of Trustees in 2014. On May 1, 2019, Dr. Matos Rodriguez became the new Chancellor of the City University of New York as the first Latino and first minority educator to head the University in its 172-year history. William Tramontano served as QC's interim president from 2019 until July 1, 2020 when Frank H. Wu succeeded him as the new college president. Campus and facilities The Queens College quad The 80-acre campus, located off Kissena Boulevard, is on the highest point in Queens. Six of the original Spanish- style buildings dating back to the early 20th century still stand, such as Jefferson Hall, which was built in 1907. The college has since expanded to over 40 buildings, including the main classroom building, Powdermaker Hall, rebuilt in 2003 and named after the college's distinguished anthropologist Hortense Powdermaker. Queens College is one of two CUNY colleges that participates in Division II sports (the other is The College of Staten Island). A Child Development Center, staffed by professionals, offers inexpensive child care services to students with children. The college is also home to the Godwin-Ternbach Museum, which houses more than 6,000 works of art. The college holds courses at several off-campus locations, including the 43rd Street Extension Center in Manhattan and the CUNY Center for Higher Education in downtown Flushing, which opened in late 2003. The college has a low-rise 506-bed residence hall on campus called the Summit Apartments, which opened in late 2009. This makes Queens College one of only three CUNY campuses with dorm facilities (the other two being Hunter College and City College). The college is home to the Aaron Copland School of Music (named for Aaron Copland), which is located in the Music Building. The Music Building also houses the music library and the 490-seat LeFrak Concert Hall. CUNY School of Law was previously located to the west of the campus of Queens College; while it was always a separate administrative unit of CUNY, the building itself read \\"CUNY School of Law at Queens College,\\" and was once a building for the Department of Education. The CUNY Board of Trustees approved plans for the Law School to be relocated to 2 Court Square in Long Island City, with the first semester of classes held in 2012. Queens College has since taken over the former Law School building, now named Queens Hall and home to the college's language departments. Townsend Harris High School and John Bowne High School are located at the edge of the Queens College campus.

The Kupferberg Center for the Arts  The Kupferberg Center for the Arts is home to Colden Auditorium, Goldstein Theatre, and the Ethel & Samuel Lefrak Concert Hall. Trevor Noah, Jerry Seinfeld, David Bowie, Patti LaBelle and Johnny Mathis, Victor Manuelle, Cesar Millan, and El Gran Combo have performed at Colden. Benjamin Rosenthal Library alt= The campus maintains the Benjamin Rosenthal Library. The library's Chaney-Schwerner-Goodman Clocktower was named after the three civil rights workers who were murdered in 1964, including Andrew Goodman, a Queens College student. Built in 1988, the library contains over 800,000 books, 32,600 print and electronic materials, the electronic archives, a collection of multimedia materials in its Media Center and an art center. The library is also home to the papers of Robert Morris and the Louis Armstrong archives. The Art Library and the Queens College Art Center are on the sixth floor of Rosenthal. The Art Library has over 70,000 books; 5,000 bound periodicals; and 110,000 slides, pictures, and exhibition catalogs and pamphlets. The collection includes resources for the study of all aspects of the visual arts and material culture, including art and architectural history, theory, criticism, materials, techniques, and practice. Nurtured by both the Aaron Copland School of Music and the Queens College Libraries, the Music Library has evolved into a first-class research facility and is the largest music collection in the CUNY system. The Music Library is located on two levels in the School of Music building and contains over 35,000 scores, 30,000 books, and 20,000 sound recordings, including the David S. Walker Music Education Collection and the Ursula Springer Choral Music Collection. Godwin-Ternbach Museum Since 1957 Queens College has been collecting works of art, these collections were initially used for teaching purposes and were meant to serve the college community. The collections were eventually brought together with the establishment of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum in 1980. The museum is now a part of the Kupferberg Center for the Arts, which has joined together all the works of art on campus in collaborations of visual, performance, dance, and theater arts. In the early 1990s, the museum was downsized due to budget cuts. Over the next few years, the college kept it open but on a reduced budget and staff. In 2001, however, the college hired Amy Winter as director of the museum. To address the concerns of the museum Winter turned to MAP (The Museum Assessment Program); as a result not only did the museum improve its facilities but increased its collections-related staff as well. Today the museum is an integral part of Queens College that serves not only the faculty and staff but the community at large. The museum, located in Klapper Hall, maintains a fine collection of 6,000 pieces of art, as well as artifacts from all cultures dating from ancient times to the modern day. These include works by Rembrandt Van Rijn, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Georges Braque. The museum also hosts a series of exhibitions each year. These exhibitions and events are free and open to the public. Residence The Summit is Queens College's first residence hall, it opened in the fall of 2009. Queens College's first residence hall, the Summit Apartments, opened in 2009. This low-rise, 506-bed facility is located in the middle of the campus. Queens College is still primarily a commuter school, as only 500 of its over 19,000 students live on campus. The building has a gold certificate from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an organization that certifies buildings to have met environmentally sustainable construction standards. Queens College's residence hall offers study lounges on each floor, wireless internet, laundry services, and a state of the art fitness center. The Summit Apartments also includes kitchens with full-size appliances, as well as dining areas, microwaves, couches, entertainment stands, and music practice rooms. In addition to the Summit, many students rent apartments off campus in the surrounding neighborhoods. Transportation Queens College operates a free shuttle service for students from campus (next to the Student Union building) to major transportation hubs in Flushing and Jamaica. The shuttle service also transports students from the Kissena end of campus to the Main Street end. The shuttle operates seven days a week.

QC is the only CUNY school to participate in NCAA Division II sports. The Queens College Athletics and Recreation sponsors 15 men's and women's championship-eligible varsity teams. The longest running among these programs are the men's basketball and baseball teams. The men's basketball team has put a team on the court in every season since its inception in 1938. On February 14, 2004 the team played its 1500th game and, in those 1500 games, has produced twenty 1,000-point scorers. Of these twenty players, twelve have achieved this after the college began play in NCAA Division II in 1983 and three of these players: Alan Hevesi (#5), Norman Roberts (#15) & Geoff Maloney (#22) have had their numbers retired. Although the program has a long-running record of achievement, its biggest successes have come in the 21st century. In 2001 the Knights earned their first NCAA Division II Northeast Regional bid. A year later the team earned its second consecutive bid along with the program's first NYCAC championship. In 2005 the team once again was crowned NYCAC Champions and received an automatic bid to the NCAAs.Queens College Athletics Baseball With the exception of three years during World War II, the baseball program, like men's basketball, has fielded a team since 1938. In both 1967 and 1976 the team captured the Knickerbocker Conference championship, and in 1981 it won the CUNY championship. Their championships in 1976 and 1981 also earned them NCAA Division III tournament bids. More recently, the squad captured the NYCAC regular season championships in 1997 and 1998, the NYCAC tournament championship in 1998 and a bid to the NCAA Division II Northeast Regional. Seven players have been drafted and nine players have gone on to play professionally with organizations including the New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago White Sox and Kansas City Royals. The latest of these draftees is 1998 All-American Justin Davies who, after playing in the Toronto Blue Jays organization for two seasons, has spent four years (2000‚Äì2004) as on outfielder for the Long Island Ducks of the Independent League. Women's basketball The women's basketball team has also experienced success. On March 24, 1973, the Knights, who were ranked #2 in the country, took the FitzGerald Gymnasium court with the AIAW (Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) National Championship at stake. On February 22, 1975 they played in the first women's basketball game ever played in Madison Square Garden. Three players from this era (Debbie Mason (#15), Gail Marquis (#25) and Althea Gwyn (#31)) have had their numbers retired. On January 4, 2015, the two teams played in the Maggie Dixon Classic as a commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the original event. In the 2000s, the team has rebounded from a short down period to make a return to the NYCAC playoffs while producing several top-flight players, including Honorable Mention All-American in Carolyn Burke. In 2014 and 2015, under the Leadership of Bet Naumovski, the women's team won East Coast Conference Championships and advanced to the second round of NCAA postseason play in 2015. Softball In the period from 1997 to 2003, the softball team posted a .640 winning percentage and won 30 or more games in a season three times. One of those 30 win seasons came in 1999 when the team won their first NYCAC tournament championship and earned their first NCAA bid. Two season later, third team All-American Cheryl Cosenzo helped lead the Lady Knights to their second NYCAC championship as well as an NCAA bid and in 2002 the team earned their third Northeast Regional bid in five years.

The \\"Song\\" act is Tell Me on a Sunday, with lyrics by Don Black and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, about a young British woman's romantic misadventures in New York City and Hollywood. The \\"Dance\\" act is a ballet choreographed to Variations, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber for his cellist brother Julian, which is based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by Paganini. Background The Song portion was written specifically for Marti Webb, and presented at the Sydmonton Festival in the summer of 1979. It was subsequently recorded and aired as a one-hour television special by the BBC the following January. The Dance portion was recorded in 1978, and nearly became incorporated into Cats. The opening sequence was utilized as the theme music for London Weekend Television's South Bank Show. Producer Cameron Mackintosh proposed that the two pieces be combined under the umbrella title Song and Dance to acknowledge the primary aspect of each act, billing the piece as \\"a concert for the theatre\\". Black altered some of the songs from the original album and worked with Lloyd Webber on new material: \\"The Last Man in My Life\\", \\"I Love New York\\" and \\"Married Man\\", the latter set to the same tune as \\"Sheldon Bloom\\". A new orchestration of the Variations for a sixteen-piece theatre orchestra was produced from the original symphonic version played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra but Harry Rabinowitz retained the baton for the stage production. \\"When You Want to Fall in Love\\", with a tune previously released by Marti Webb and Justin Hayward as \\"Unexpected Song\\" which itself was later added to the score, was used at the climax of the dance section to meld the two halves. Productions 1982 London The musical had its world premiere on March 26, 1982 at the Palace Theatre, where it ran for 781 performances, with direction by Tom Gutteridge Marti Webb performed the Song half; she subsequently was succeeded by Gemma Craven, Lulu, and Liz Robertson. Carol Nielsson, Webb's original understudy took over the role with two hour notice when Lulu damaged her voice after a foldback monitor failed during a performance. The Dance portion was choreographed by Anthony Van Laast and featured Wayne Sleep and Jane Darling. The original recording of the London production was made live on the opening night using a recording studio then built into the Palace Theatre. The album was produced by Martin Levan, who also designed the sound system for the show. Soon after the production closed, the show was filmed for a television broadcast, with Sarah Brightman and Wayne Sleep in the lead roles. 1983 Australia The Australian production of the musical opened at the Theatre Royal in Sydney on 4 August 1983. It featured Gaye MacFarlane and John Meehan in the leading roles.https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/109597 1985 Broadway In anticipation of a Broadway run, director and lyricist Richard Maltby, Jr. was approached to adapt the first act for an American audience. The Broadway production, choreographed by Peter Martins, opened on September 18, 1985 at the Royale Theatre conducted by John Mauceri, and closed on November 8, 1986, after 474 performances and seventeen previews. Bernadette Peters starred in Song for nearly thirteen months; she was succeeded by Betty Buckley for the final four weeks. Dance featured Christopher d'Amboise and Gregg Burge. Amongst the many changes to the show, the characters were all given names, with 'the girl' now known as Emma. Singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester starred in a subsequent 6-month US national tour of the show in 1987, starting in Dallas, Texas and ending in Tampa, Florida.Harrison, Thomas B. \\"Melissa Manchester: Pop music pro enters a new stage with 'Song and Dance'\\", St. Petersburg Times (Florida), December 8, 1987, p. 1DListing, see Pittsburgh, Civic Light Opera CompanyThe New York Times, August 9, 1987, p.

A one-woman show, it has been performed by a number of female singers/actors, most notably Marti Webb and Bernadette Peters. A one-act song cycle, it tells the story of an ordinary English girl from Muswell Hill, who journeys to the United States in search of love. Her romantic misadventures begin in New York City, lead her to Hollywood, and eventually take her back to Manhattan. Background The musical is based on an idea originally conceived by Tim Rice, who intended to develop it as a cycle of television shows with songwriting partner Andrew Lloyd Webber. The two relished working on a small- scale project following Evita. Shortly after they began working, however, Lloyd Webber realized Rice was writing specifically for Elaine Paige, with whom the married father of two young children was having a blatant affair. Lloyd Webber felt that allowing Paige to appear in the series would suggest he approved of the relationship, so he decided to look for a new lyricist. He opted for Don Black who, following a successful stint in Hollywood (including an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"Born Free\\"), had begun writing for the theatre. Although it had proven to be unsuccessful, his Bar Mitzvah Boy had impressed Lloyd Webber, who thought Black would be a good match.Citron, Stephen. Sondheim & Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical. New York, New York: Oxford University Press 2001. pp. 262‚Äì63 Rice's original concept had kept 'the girl' in the UK. It was Black who suggested she emigrate to the States. He quickly began writing lyrics for several tunes Lloyd Webber already had composed. It was their intent to present as complete a work as possible at the Sydmonton Festival in September 1979. The two decided to cast Marti Webb, who was portraying Eva Per√≥n at the matinee performances of Evita, as their heroine,Citron, p. 264 and the show was first presented at the Sydmonton Festival in 1979. Productions Original album and broadcast The positive reception at Sydmonton led to the show being recorded as an album. Following this, a special performance was filmed at the Royalty Theatre in London on 28 January 1980, and later broadcast on the BBC on 12 February. The broadcast was a critical success and garnered high ratings, leading it to be repeated the following month.Citron, p. 266 Following its transmission, the album reached #2 on the UK charts, and the single release of \\"Take That Look Off Your Face\\" reached #3. This success propelled Marti Webb into a household name, despite being in the theatrical business for twenty years. She followed this with a number of her own albums and two further top 20 singles. Song and Dance Lloyd Webber decided the piece could work well on the stage if paired with another one-act piece. He previously had considered writing a brief operatic piece about the friendship between Giacomo Puccini and Ruggiero Leoncavallo, going so far as to compose a melody that would later become \\"Memory\\", but decided it would not fit well with 'the girl's' saga. He tried adapting the Charles Dickens work The Signal-Man, but decided it was too gloomy and rejected it as well. Eventually he and Black set aside Tell Me on a Sunday and turned to other projects.Citron, pp. 266‚Äì67 In 1982, the creative team decided to combine Tell Me on a Sunday with a ballet choreographed to Lloyd Webber's Variations, a classical piece based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by Paganini that had debuted at Sydmonton in 1977. Following some revisions, including a new song \\"The Last Man in My Life\\" and several changes to the lyrics, Tell Me on a Sunday became Act I of Song and Dance, which was staged at the West End with Marti Webb again starring as 'the girl'. Over the course of its run, she was succeeded by Lulu, Gemma Craven, Liz Robertson, and Sarah Brightman. Three years later, lyricist Richard Maltby, Jr. was brought in to help adapt the show for an American audience, in anticipation of a Broadway run. Bernadette Peters was chosen for the role of 'the girl', who was now renamed Emma. It opened on 18 September 1985 to mixed reviews. Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes thought it was \\"the best thing that Lloyd Webber has written for the theater,\\" but Frank Rich of the New York Times was not impressed, observing that \\"empty material remains empty, no matter how talented those who perform it. Emma is a completely synthetic, not to mention insulting, creation whom no performer could redeem.\\"Citron, p. 309 Peters went on to win the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical, but the show failed to win Best Musical or Best Original Score. Black, unimpressed that Peters had insisted on gathering background information about the character, later said he preferred the original London production and Webb's performance.Inverne, James, Wrestling With Elephants: The Authorised Biography of Don Black. London: Sanctuary Publishing Ltd. 2003. , p. 137 Subsequent productions as a stand-alone piece Reverting to its one-act format, Tell Me on a Sunday was substantially rewritten, with five new songs and additional material by Jackie Clune, for a 2003 London production at the Gielgud Theatre. The BBC critic observed, \\"this may be the smallest show Lloyd Webber's ever written, but the score (to appropriately conversational lyrics by Don Black) contains several of his very best songs.\\" Directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring Denise Van Outen, it ran for ten months. Marti Webb succeeded Van Outen and subsequently toured the UK with the show, alternating with former Steps vocalist, Faye Tozer, and actress Patsy Palmer. In 2008, the Alloy Theater Company staged the original one-act version with Irish actress, Maxine Linehan, at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City. That same year, Bailiwick Repertory produced the Chicago premiere starring Harmony France to rave reviews and the Kookaburra Theatre presented the Australian premiere starring Jolene Anderson, with Noni Hazlehurst and John Waters providing the voices of \\"Mum\\" and \\"Married Man\\" respectively. Despite mixed reviews, it had sellout performances in both Sydney and Melbourne. The show toured the United Kingdom, beginning on 30 August 2010 at Northampton's Royal Theatre and continuing until autumn 2011. The tour starred Claire Sweeney as 'the girl' and was directed by Tamara Harvey. The script was again updated for the 21st century, and 'the girl' was rewritten as originating from Liverpool, like Claire Sweeney herself. The song list stayed closer to the original, although a new finale was added, \\"Dreams Never Run on Time\\", itself a rewrite of the song \\"Somewhere, Someplace, Sometime\\" from the 2003 version. In late 2013, Marti Webb performed the songs \\"Tell Me on a Sunday\\" and \\"Take That Look Off Your Face\\" at a tribute show to Don Black, where she met Lewis Carnie, the Head of Programmes for BBC Radio 2, who asked if she would consider performing the entire piece again for broadcast on the station. Producer Robert Mackintosh then suggested the show could be staged for a week at the St James Theatre, London in January, the popularity of which saw it being restaged for three weeks at the Duchess Theatre in February and early March, with musical direction by Simon Lee. The latest production in Mandarin, will premier in Shanghai, China in early June 2018 with musical supervision by Fiz Shapur, who also supervised the Mandarin language production of CATS. Synopsis 'The girl' arrives in New York City, and tells her friend that she does not want to become a hard-bitten career woman or a user of men. Shortly after, she discovers her beau has been cheating on her with numerous other women and she walks out. She meets Hollywood producer Sheldon Bloom, who takes her to Los Angeles. Sheldon's career ambitions preclude his spending much time on a personal relationship and, after realizing life in the film capital is uneventful and Sheldon has been using her as a trophy girlfriend, 'the girl' returns to Manhattan. Back in Greenwich Village, 'the girl' meets a salesman, and once again faces disappointment when she learns he frequently has been in town with other women when he supposedly was away on business. The two split up and she meets a married man. Intent on succeeding in her career and acquiring a green card, she is content with the noon-to-two relationship they share, until he announces he plans to leave his wife and marry her instead. She is horrified because not only does she not love him, but she realizes she's been using him, something she had vowed never to do. She sends him away and promises herself she will return to being the idealistic and ethical woman she was when she first arrived in the States. 'The girl' is the only person who appears on stage, despite having conversations with her friends and writing letters to her mum.

It is the hottest desert in Mexico. It has an area of . The western portion of the United States‚ÄìMexico border passes through the Sonoran Desert. In phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran Floristic Province of the Madrean Region in southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic Kingdom of the northern Western Hemisphere. The desert contains a variety of unique and endemic plants and animals, such as the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi). Location The Sonoran desert wraps around the northern end of the Gulf of California, from Baja California Sur (El Vizca√≠no Biosphere Reserve in central and Pacific west coast, Central Gulf Coast subregion on east to southern tip), north through much of Baja California, excluding the central northwest mountains and Pacific west coast, through southeastern California and southwestern and southern Arizona to western and central parts of Sonora. It is bounded on the west by the Peninsular Ranges, which separate it from the California chaparral and woodlands (northwest) and Baja California Desert (Vizcaino subregion, central and southeast) ecoregions of the Pacific slope. To the north in California and northwest Arizona, the Sonoran Desert transitions to the colder-winter, higher-elevation Mojave, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau deserts. To the east and southeast, the deserts transition to the coniferous Arizona Mountains forests and Sierra Madre and Sierra Madre Occidental pine‚Äìoak forests at higher elevations. To the south the Sonoran‚ÄìSinaloan transition subtropical dry forest is the transition zone from the Sonoran Desert to the tropical dry forests of the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Sub-region deserts The desert's sub-regions include the Colorado Desert of southeastern California; and the Yuma Desert east of the north-to-south section of the Colorado River in southwest Arizona. In the 1957 publication Vegetation of the Sonoran Desert, Forrest Shreve divided the Sonoran Desert into seven regions according to characteristic vegetation: Lower Colorado Valley, Arizona Upland, Plains of Sonora, Foothills of Sonora, Central Gulf Coast, Vizca√≠no Region, and Magdalena Region. Many ecologists consider Shreve's Vizca√≠no and Magdalena regions, which lie on the western side of the Baja California Peninsula, to be a separate ecoregion, the Baja California Desert. Within the southern Sonoran Desert in Mexico is found the Gran Desierto de Altar, with the Reserva de la Biosfera el Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar ('Pinacate National Park' in Mexico), extending of desert and mountainous regions. The Pinacate National Park includes the only active erg dune region in North America. The nearest city to the Reserva de la Biosfera el Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar is Puerto Pe√±asco ('Rocky Point') in the state of Sonora, Mexico. ;Sub-regions Sonoran Desert sub- regions include: *Colorado Desert *Gran Desierto de Altar *Lechuguilla Desert *Tonopah Desert *Yuha Desert *Yuma Desert Fauna 350 bird species, 20 amphibian species, over 100 reptile species, 30 native fish species, over 1000 native bee species, and more than 2,000 native plant species can be found in the desert area.Surviving the Sonoran The Sonoran Desert area southeast of Tucson and near the Mexican border is vital habitat for the only population of jaguars living within the United States.The Jaguar in the Borderlands of Arizona, New Mexico and Northern Mexico: Conservation ‚Äì Threats & Strategies The Colorado River Delta was once an ecological hotspot within the Sonoran desert due to the Colorado river in this otherwise dry area, but the delta has been greatly reduced in extent due to the damming and use of the river upstream. Species that have higher heat tolerance are able to thrive in the conditions of the Sonoran Desert. One such insect species that has evolved a means to thrive in this environment is Drosophila mettleri, a Sonoran Desert fly. This fly contains a specialized P450 detoxification system that enables it to nest in the cool region of exudate moistened soil. Thus, the fly is one of few that can tolerate the high desert temperatures and successfully reproduce. Flora The Sonoran Desert near Tucson, Arizona during winter. Many plants not only survive, but thrive in the harsh conditions of the Sonoran Desert. Many have evolved to have specialized adaptations to the desert climate. The Sonoran Desert's biseasonal rainfall pattern results in more plant species than any other desert in the world. The Sonoran Desert includes plant genera and species from the agave family, palm family, cactus family, legume family, and numerous others. The Sonoran is the only place in the world where the famous saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) grows in the wild. Cholla (Cylindropuntia spp.), beavertail (Opuntia basilaris), hedgehog (Echinocereus spp.), fishhook (Ferocactus wislizeni), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), nightblooming cereus (Peniocereus spp.), and organ pipe (Stenocereus thurberi) are other taxa of cacti found here. Cactus provides food and homes to many desert mammals and birds, with showy flowers in reds, pinks, yellows, and whites, blooming most commonly from late March through June, depending on the species and seasonal temperatures.

Extremely little is known about him. An East-Saxon genealogy preserved as British Library Add. MS 23211, possibly of the late 9th century, makes him a son and successor of King √Üscwine. The post-Conquest historians Henry of Huntingdon (Historia Anglorum), Roger of Wendover (Flores Historiarum) and Matthew Paris (Chronica Majora) substitute the name Eorcenwine (Erkenwine, Erchenwine) as his father. Though their testimony is centuries removed from Sledd's floruit, it is thought that they drew on alternative pre-Conquest material. Although √Üscwine or Eorcenwine is sometimes credited with the foundation of the kingdom, genealogies included in the works of William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester (Chronicon B) make Sledd the first king of Essex, while the genealogies in Add. MS 23211 use Sledd as their point of convergence. This suggests that Sledd may have been regarded as the founder of the East Saxon house. On no known authority, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris state that Sledd directly succeeded his father on his death in 587. Sledd married Ricula, sister of King √Üthelberht of Kent. He was father of S√¶berht, whose rule began in c. 604, and of another son, Seaxa, whose descendants supplanted those of S√¶berht in the mid-8th century.

It was directed by Tensai Okamura and featured character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto with a soundtrack produced and arranged by Yoko Kanno. It focuses on the journey of four lone wolves who cross paths while following the scent of the Lunar Flower and seeking Paradise. Wolf's Rain spans twenty-six television episodes and four original video animation (OVA) episodes, with each episode running approximately twenty-five minutes. The series was originally broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV and the anime CS television network, Animax. The complete thirty episode series is licensed for North American release by Funimation, in Europe by Beez Entertainment and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The series was adapted into a short two-volume manga series written by Keiko Nobumoto and illustrated by Toshitsugu Iida. The manga, which was released while the series was airing, is a retelling of the story rather than a straight adaptation. It was originally serialized in Magazine Z and has been released in North America by Viz Media. The anime series was well-received in Japan, being the third-ranked anime series in its timeslot while airing on Fuji TV. The Bandai Entertainment English-language release sold well in North America. It helped Bandai gain the 2004 Anime Company of the Year award from industry news company ICv2 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga. The manga adaptation was selected as one of their top ten anime products of 2005 and sold well in North America. Reviewers of the series gave it high marks for characterization, visual presentation, narrative and its soundtrack, while disparaging the existence of four recapitulation episodes in the middle of the series. The manga adaptation also sold well in North America and received good reviews, though reviewers felt its short length resulted in a rushed plot and neglected supporting characters. Plot According to an old legend, when the end of the world comes, a place known as Paradise will appear. However, only wolves will know how to find it. Although wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction nearly two hundred years ago, they still exist, surviving by casting illusions over themselves to make them appear human. Freeze City is a northern human city in a world where the majority of people live in poverty and hardship. Kiba, an injured lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City following the scent of the Lunar Flower, which is the key to opening Paradise. There he encounters Tsume, Hige and Toboe, three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by the scent of the Lunar Flower and are now living in the city. The wolves encounter Quent Yaiden, a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog Blue. Cheza, the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of Cher Degr√©. She is awakened by the smell of wolf's blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by Lord Darcia the Third, whose people created Cheza. With the Flower Maiden gone, the wolves have no reason to stay in the city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to stay together and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city's army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher's ex-husband Hubb Lebowski searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless pursuit of the wolves. When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and take on her own human form. She joins the wolves and travels with them for a while, developing an intense and close romantic relationship with Hige, and meanwhile Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now searching for Blue as well as the wolves. Hubb eventually finds Cher and from there they continue their pursuit of the wolves to find Cheza. Together the wolves reach Darcia's keep after Kiba goes off on his own. Hubb, Cher and Quent arrive in the keep, and Tsume, Toboe, and Hige find Kiba, Cheza and Darcia during a sword fight between Darcia and Kiba. The reunion is short- lived however because Jaguara's troops attack, destroying the keep in the process. The Noble's troops capture Cheza, Hubb, Cher and Blue during the raid, and the wolves get separated from Kiba. After finding Kiba, the wolves continue their journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, while Cher rescues Blue and manages to find Cheza with help from Hubb, but Jaguara's troops instantly recapture Cheza, taking Hubb with them and forcing Cher and Blue to find Cheza on their own. The wolves and the humans eventually come together in Jaguara's city, where the captured Cheza is being held. In attempting to rescue the abducted Cheza, Kiba, Tsume and Toboe are captured. Tsume and Toboe are thrown into a dungeon with Hubb while Jaguara attempts to use Kiba's blood to force Paradise to open. Meanwhile, Hige and Blue are reunited outside the Keep, where Hige remembers that he had once worked for Jaguara and decides to go rescue his friends, but not before telling Blue to stay outside and promising her that he will return to her no matter what. While waiting for Hige, Blue is reunited with her master Quent and meanwhile Darcia, having survived the attack on his keep, interrupts Jaguara's ceremony as Kiba and the other wolves break free and rush to free the Flower Maiden. Hige is wounded during the fight against Jaguara and Kiba arrives after Darcia is poisoned by the Noble. Darcia battles Jaguara along with Kiba and finally slays her as the keep begins to collapse, ending the anime's original 26-episode run. As the original video animation (OVA) episodes begin, the wolves and the humans escape Jaguara's city, which has fallen into chaos. Quent is gravely wounded saving Blue from an oncoming vehicle, but he and Blue are found by Hubb and Cher, and subsequently by the wolves and Cheza. Together, they all continue making their way to Paradise, pursued by the now insane Darcia. As the Earth begins to fall into destruction, Cher dies when the car falls off a cliff. And soon after, Toboe is accidentally shot by Quent when he tries to shoot Darcia who in turn kills Quent. Hubb tries to keep up with the remaining wolves climbing up a mountain, but falls to his death. Darcia attacks the remaining wolves killing Hige, Blue, and Tsume, leaving only Kiba, Cheza and Darcia alive at the place where Paradise can be opened. Darcia and Kiba battle over who will open Paradise, in which Kiba is fatally wounded. Darcia dies when he attempts to enter Paradise due to not being a true wolf. Kiba finds Cheza as she dies and disintegrates into seeds. Dying, Kiba concludes that his quest has failed, but rain begins to fall and Cheza's seeds grow into thousands of lunar flowers. As he dies, Kiba falls into the water's depths but sees the blood red moon turning back to its normal color. Cheza's death causes Paradise, as well as the world, to be reborn. However, Darcia's corruption can be seen taking root in this new Paradise. The final scenes take place in what appears to be a 21st-century Japanese city. Kiba, apparently reincarnated as a human, passes other humans who resemble Tsume, Hige and Toboe; a lunar flower is seen blooming in an alleyway. Changes in the manga adaptation The two-volume manga adaptation includes some of the core events of the anime series with few changes, but as a whole the manga veers greatly from its anime inspiration. Many events from the anime do not occur in the manga, and some of the events from the anime that are presented in the manga are completely different in terms of dialogue, chronological sequence, and final outcomes. In particular, the second volume tells an almost completely different story, with Darcia recruiting Blue to help him open the door to Paradise with her blood. The wolves must go to Darcia's keep, rather than Jaguara's, in order to free Cheza, with Kiba missing but appearing at the end to make the final rescue effort. At the end of the manga, the four wolves and Cheza are sitting on a rock as the clouds break and sunlight streams through for the first time. The world rejoices the end of the Ice Age and rumors that Paradise has been found abound. In the manga most of the characters are similar in appearance and personality to their anime counterparts, but some characters seen in the anime do not appear in the manga, including the Noble Lord Orkham. Principal characters * is a white wolf who is dedicated solely to finding the Lunar Flower and opening the way to Paradise. He will protect Cheza with his life. Kiba primarily acts on his instincts, which sometimes lead him to behave rashly, this shows the dogmatic changes through a wolf's position in a human mindset or a wolf mindset, and this causes the other characters to call him idealistic. Full of wolf pride, Kiba initially expresses disgust at wolves who use human disguises, but eventually realizes that it is necessary to survive. Voiced by: Mamoru Miyano (Japanese); Johnny Yong Bosch (English, Bandai Visual dub), Darren Pleavin (English, Animax Asia dub) * is a gray wolf with a large X-shaped scar across his chest, not counting many others. Rough and self- reliant, Tsume is a strong fighter who keeps his true feelings to himself. He joins the others after his human gang in Freeze City betrays him. He does not initially believe in Paradise, but eventually starts to believe in their goal after seeing the great sacrifices his new pack was doing in order to open Paradise. Though he frequently quarrels with Kiba over their journey, he eventually accepts his leadership and comes to trust in him, also growing protective of Toboe and eventually forming a brotherly relationship with him. Voiced by: Kenta Miyake (Japanese); Crispin Freeman (English, Bandai Visual dub), Victor Lee (English, Animax Asia dub) * is a brown wolf with a carefree attitude, who seems quite comfortable living in human society. Hige likes to converse with girls and to eat, and due to the former he is quite chubby. After meeting Kiba, he goes along with the idea of searching for Paradise without much argument. Hige wears a collar around his neck, that seems to attract soldiers of a Noble, Lady Jaguara, leading him to put his wolf crew in danger and himself in pain. Voiced by: Akio Suyama (Japanese); Joshua Seth (English, Bandai Visual dub) * is a red/brown wolf and the youngest of the group. He is considered the pup or the runt by the others, but after he desperately fights a huge walrus during the journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, the other wolves change their mind about him. He was raised by an old woman who found him outside the city, and still wears the bracelets she gave him. Due to his upbringing, Toboe is friendly and protective towards most humans. He forms a brotherly relationship with Tsume. Voiced by: Hiroki Shimowada (Japanese); Mona Marshall (English, Bandai Visual dub), Candice Moore (English, Animax Asia dub) * is also called the \\"Flower Maiden\\". The wolves need Cheza to find and open the gateway to Paradise. She was created via alchemy from a Lunar Flower, and as such needs water and sunlight to survive. Originally asleep and under study in a lab in Freeze City, Cheza is eventually able to join the wolves, whom she loves, and travels with them. She refers to herself in the third person, usually adapted to \\"this one\\". The spilling of wolf blood makes Cheza scream, and she has the ability to heal them or put them to sleep through her song and touch. Voiced by: Arisa Ogasawara (Japanese); Sherry Lynn (English, Bandai Visual dub), Andrea Kwan (English, Animax Asia dub) * is a blue wolf/dog hybrid. At first, she travels along with Quent Yaiden, hunting wolves. But after Blue finds out that she is actually half-wolf, and unwilling to hunt her own kind, Blue leaves Quent to join the wolves, eventually falling in love with Hige. She is strong, fearless and independent. Voiced by: Mayumi Asano (Japanese); Jessica Strauss (English, Bandai Visual dub), Sarah Hauser (English, Animax Asia dub) Media Anime The Wolf's Rain anime series was produced by BONES and directed by Tensai Okamura. Keiko Nobumoto was the writer and story editor, while Toshihiro Kawamoto created the character designs. The series premiered in Japan on Fuji TV on January 6, 2003 and ran for a full season of twenty-six episodes, with the final episode airing on July 29, 2003. A four-episode original video animation (OVA) was later created and released to DVD to provide a fuller conclusion to the story than the original television run did, and to make up for the four recapitulation episodes that were originally broadcast in the middle of the series. The first two OVA episodes were released on January 23, 2004, with the final two released a month later on February 25, 2004. Animax also aired the series on its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Latin America, Europe, and other regions. Except for the four recap episodes, the entire Wolf's Rain anime series aired in the United States as part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup in 2004. It was broadcast on Europe's digital specialty station Rapture TV from November 14, 2005 to July 6, 2006. It also aired in the UK on Anime Central starting November 4, 2007, with only the first 26 episodes airing. Wolf's Rain was licensed for Region 1 DVD release by Bandai Entertainment. The entire series, including the four OVAs, were released in seven individual volumes that contained four episodes, except for the first two volumes, which had five episodes. With the first volume, Bandai offered a stand-alone version and a limited edition version, which included an art box, Kiba plushie, and the first CD soundtrack. Bandai also released the thirty episodes in a complete series box set and in a two-part \\"Anime Legends\\" collection. Funimation has since licensed the series following the closure of Bandai Entertainment and released the series on a Blu-ray and DVD combo pack on February 7, 2017. In Region 2 (Europe) the series is licensed by Beez Entertainment, which also released the entire series, including the OVAs, in seven individual volumes, and later as a box set which also included the first soundtrack CD (see below). In Region 4, Madman Entertainment owns the series license and released all twenty-six episodes and four OVA episodes in the form of a complete series box set. CDs All of the music for the Wolf's Rain soundtrack was composed and arranged by Yoko Kanno. The vocal songs are performed by various artists, including Maaya Sakamoto, Raj Ramayya, Ilaria Graziano, Steve Conte and Joyce, and they were recorded around the world, including Japan, Poland, Brazil, the United States, and Italy to offer a diverse range of music and give the soundtrack an international flavor. Two CD soundtracks, produced by Yoko Kanno, Toshiaki Ota, and Shiro Sasaki, were released in Japan by Victor Entertainment. \\"Gravity\\", the series' ending theme, is a song performed by Maaya Sakamoto. It was released as a single on February 21, 2003. Wolf's Rain Original Soundtrack, Volume 1 was released March 29, 2003.

It is composed by Yoko Kanno, with vocals by Steve Conte, Gabriela Robin, Maaya Sakamoto, Ben Del Maestro, Ryouko Kinomiya, Ripped and edited by Chad Franklin. Chad Franklin is a novice audio engineer and a fan who took the time and effort to make this soundtrack into a format which others could enjoy without overhearing special effects or character voicing. https://chadfranklin47.bandcamp.com/album/wolfs- rain-unofficial-ost-3-unreleased Manga The two-volume manga series was originally serialized in Magazine Z, a monthly seinen magazine, with the first chapter premiering in April 2003. The manga, which was written by Nobumoto and illustrated by Toshitsugu Iida, is an almost complete retelling of the anime story. Each chapter of the manga series is called a \\"grope\\", which is a reference to a Japanese phrase for arriving somewhere after enduring hardships. The two volumes were released in North America by VIZ Media as individual volumes in 2004 and 2005. An exclusive edition of the first volume was released on November 5, 2004 in Borders and Waldenbooks stores that included a collectible box to hold both volumes and a 3D lenticular card. The Viz English release is adapted by David Ury, who also acted as translator and Egan Loo. The series has also been released in German by Heyne, in Italian by Shin Vision and in Polish by Japonica Polonica Fantastica. Reception In Japan, Wolf's Rain ranked third among anime series airing in the same time slot behind Air Master and Dear Boys. The series was considered \\"a big hit in 2004\\" for the North American market, selling well in mass markets as well as in online markets and at independent retailers. ICv2 notes that it has \\"a strong appeal to the growing teen and older anime audience.\\" The series was selected as one of the top ten anime properties of 2005 for the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga. Its release was also a central reason Bandai Entertainment earned the ICv2 Anime Company of the Year award for 2004. Tasha Robinson of SciFi Weekly praised the series for its unusual focus on non-human characters and the interesting dynamic of wolves behaving like wolves as they interact with the human characters and environments in the series. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised the visuals of the series, noting that they \\"showcase Studio BONES at their most imaginative, with beautiful backgrounds that depict settings from high-tech mysticism to urban decay to open wilderness. The character designs are equally striking: in their human form, the wolves wear contemporary outfits, making them the most accessible of all characters.\\" Both Santos and Chris Beveridge of Mania.com noted that the Region 1 DVD volume containing the four recapitulation episodes should be left unbought and skipped as a waste of money; however, they praised Bandai's release of the episodes for putting the episodes on a single volume, unlike in the Japanese release where they were spread over two DVDs requiring them to be bought to get the new episodes on the same volumes. Other critics have complained that while the show had an original and innovative storyline with beautiful visuals and appealing characters, the episodes themselves were poorly paced, undeveloped, and plagued with plot holes. In The Anime Encyclopedia, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy criticized the production delays and the hiatuses that led to the creation of the four recap episodes, stating that \\"if the makers had spent less time recounting the story so far, they might have had more than enough space to finish the entire run within the requisite 26 episodes\\". They praised the series' soundtrack, feeling it supported \\"the atmosphere and character development\\", and felt the \\"moody, dark, and understated\\" art was attractive. Yoko Kanno's soundtrack for the series has also been hailed for its beauty and the way it adds to the series' emotional impact. The instrumental tracks were found to mirror the show's tone perfectly, evoking feelings of sorrow and loss. According to one reviewer, the soundtrack \\"...shows [Kanno's] skills as both composer and pianist...\\" and is \\"...a treat to hear.\\" Kanno's work in the series was nominated for an Annie Award in the \\"Music in an Animated Television Production\\" category in 2006. The Wolf's Rain manga adaptation has also enjoyed success in the North American market, with the second volume being the ninth best-selling graphic novel on the Nielsen BookScan list for February 13, 2007. It was considered a \\"major manga hit\\" among manga series adapted from an anime series. Anime News Network's Liann Cooper praised its artwork, but also felt its short length and rushed storyline made it hard to connect to the characters.

It is subdivided into 100 cents. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the governmental currency board and also the de facto central bank for Hong Kong and the Hong Kong dollar. Under the licence from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, three commercial banks are licensed to issue their own banknotes for general circulation in Hong Kong. The three commercial banks, HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered issue their own designs of banknotes in denominations of HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000, with all designs being similar to one another in the same denomination of banknote. However, the HK$10 banknote and all coins are issued by the Government of Hong Kong. As of April 2019, the Hong Kong dollar is the ninth most traded currency in the world. Apart from its use in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong dollar is also used in neighbouring Macau, where the Hong Kong dollar circulates alongside the Macanese pataca. History When Hong Kong was established as a free trading port in 1841, there was no local currency in everyday circulation. Foreign currencies such as Indian rupees, Spanish and Mexican 8 reales, and Chinese cash coins circulated. Since 1825, it had been the policy of the British government to introduce sterling silver coinage to all of its colonies, and to this end, in 1845 the Spanish and Mexican 8 reales coins were set at a legal tender value of 4 shillings, 2 pence sterling (50 pence). But just as in the case of the British North American colonies, the attempts to introduce the sterling coinage failed to overcome the strong local adherence to the silver Spanish dollar system. By 1858, the British government gave up all attempts to influence the currency situation in Canada, and by the 1860s it came to the same realisation in Hong Kong: that there was no point in trying to displace an already existing currency system. In 1863, the Royal Mint in London began issuing special subsidiary coinage for use in Hong Kong within the dollar system, though other national currencies circulated unofficially for years afterwards. In 1866, a local mint was established at Cleveland Street in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island for the purpose of minting Hong Kong silver dollar and half dollar coins of the same value and similar likeness to their Mexican counterparts. The Chinese did not however receive these new Hong Kong dollars well, and in 1868 the Hong Kong Mint was closed down with a loss of $440,000. The machinery at the Hong Kong mint was sold first to Jardine Matheson and in turn to the Japanese and used to make the first Yen coins in 1870. In the 1860s, banknotes of the new British colonial banks, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, denominated in dollars, also began to circulate in both Hong Kong and the wider region. In 1873, the international silver crisis resulted in a devaluation of silver against gold-based currencies. Since the silver dollars in the US and Canada were attached to a gold exchange standard, this meant that the silver dollars circulating along the China coast dropped in value as compared to the US dollar and the Canadian dollar. Early 20th Century By 1895, the circumstances had changed to the extent that there was now a dearth of Mexican dollars and the authorities in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements were putting pressure on the authorities in London to take measures to have a regular supply of silver dollar coins. London eventually acquiesced and legislation was enacted in attempts to regulate the coinage. New British trade dollars were coined at the mints in Calcutta and Bombay for use in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. In 1906, the Straits Settlements issued their own silver dollar coin and attached it to a gold sterling exchange standard at a fixed value of 2 shillings and 4 pence. This was the point of departure as between the Hong Kong unit and the Straits unit. By 1935, only Hong Kong and China remained on the silver standard. In that year, Hong Kong, shortly after China, abandoned silver and introduced a crawling peg to sterling of ¬£1 = HK$15.36 to HK$16.45. It was from this point in time that the concept of a Hong Kong dollar as a distinct unit of currency came into existence. The One-Dollar Currency Note Ordinance of that year led to the introduction of one-dollar notes by the government and the government acknowledged the Hong Kong dollar as the local monetary unit. It was not until 1937 that the legal tender of Hong Kong was finally unified. In 1939, the Hong Kong dollar was put on a fixed peg of HK$16 = ¬£1 ($1 = 1s 3d). The discussion about switching from the silver standard to the gold standard began as early as 1930. A commission report was released in May 1931. It concluded that it was important for Hong Kong to facilitate free flow of capital with China and the same monetary standard was thus preferred. The report also recommended the Hong Kong Government only to take over the burden of note issuance when the banks failed to do so. Actually, the Hong Kong Government was not willing to take up the logistics of note issuance, and some officials even thought that the public had greater degree of confidence in the notes issued by those long- established banks than that by the government. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese military yen were the only means of everyday exchange in Hong Kong. When the yen was first introduced on 26 December 1941, the exchange rate was ¬•1 yen = HK$2. However, in August 1942, the rate was changed to HK$4 to ¬•1 yen. The yen became the only legal tender on 1 June 1943. The issue of local currency was resumed by the Hong Kong government and the authorised local banks after liberation, with the pre-war rate of HK$16 = ¬£1 being restored. The yen was exchanged at a rate of ¬•100 = HK$1. On 6 September 1945, all military yen notes used in Japanese colonies were declared void by the Japanese Ministry of Finance. Post-WWII Period The Hong Kong dollar in the sterling area After the end of the Second World War, the United Kingdom made efforts in maintaining the sterling area with countries of the British Commonwealth as well as its colonies. It imposed exchange controls on non-sterling area countries, barring them from freely converting British pounds into US dollars, but no such restriction was placed on sterling area countries. As a colony of the British Empire, Hong Kong was obliged to observe the sterling area regulations. Nevertheless, its unique position afforded Hong Kong the ability to defy exchange controls by operating a dual system with the sterling area and a free exchange market, which was technically illegal from 1949 to 1967. Hong Kong economy specialist Leo Goodstadt argues that ministers and officials in London were bound to tolerate Hong Kong's situation, given Hong Kong's extensive trade with China, and the long collusion between officials in Hong Kong and bankers and local business communities .  The impacts of the devaluation of the pound on the Hong Kong dollar in 1967 In the 1960s, the UK found it difficult to keep the value of sterling as it was, with its role as official reserve currency even within the sterling area. In 1964, sterling was 83% of the official reserves of overseas sterling area countries, but this share had decreased to 75% in 1966 and to 65% in 1967. When sterling was devalued by the UK in 1967, and Hong Kong dollar's peg to the pound resulted in a re-valuation of Hong Kong dollar from $16 to $14.5, a 10% re-valuation against the pound and 5.7% devaluation against the US dollar. The unilateral devaluation sparked a circle of grievances among local business communities as well as colonial officials in Hong Kong because the official reserves and private savings in sterling were substantial from Hong Kong. In the 1950-60s, Hong Kong accumulated significant reserves in sterling with its economic growth, money supply was exponentially expanded from ¬£140-¬£160 million in the late 1950s to ¬£363 million in October 1967, equivalent to 10% of the UK's total sterling liabilities to the overseas sterling area before the devaluation. Subsequently, Hong Kong and London engaged in talks about compensation and protection against further losses. Considering the potential diversification of official reserves from sterling to the US dollars by the Hong Kong government officials, London agreed to offer exchange guarantees to protect Hong Kong against potential devaluation of sterling in the future, which was the first to receive such guarantees among the sterling area countries. Floating currency system 1974-1983 After the US's cessation of the convertibility between gold and the US dollar in October 1971, Britain abandoned the fixed exchange rate with the US dollar and extended the exchange controls also to the Sterling Area countries, which put an effective end to the Sterling Area in 1972. In the same year, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of HK$5.65 = US$1. This was revised to HK$5.085 = US$1 in 1973. Since 1974, the Hong Kong dollar was no longer anchored in another currency, which officially changed the monetary regime from currency board system to a floating currency system. Linked Exchange Rate System since 1983 On 17 October 1983, Hong Kong dollar was officially pegged to the US dollar at a rate of HK$7.8 = US$1, officially switching back to the currency board system. The peg of Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar in 1983 actually took place in the context of Sino-British negotiation regarding the future of Hong Kong after 1997. Due to the lack of public confidence in the talks, on 24 September 1983, Hong Kong dollar was devalued by 15% over 2 days to a historical low at HK$9.6 to US$1. Public panic set in and there were runs on foodstuff on this Black Saturday (1983). Amidst the monetary crisis, John Greenwood, an economist who was later dubbed the \\"architect of the Linked Exchange Rate System\\" in Hong Kong, advocated the proposal to peg the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar with a return to the former currency board system. The proposal received support from two government officials within the Monetary Affairs Branch of the Hong Kong Government, namely, the Deputy Secretary for Monetary Affairs Tony Latter and the Government Economist Alan McLean as a practical way to restore confidence in the Hong Kong dollar. After discussions between London and Hong Kong, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong Government John Bremridge announced to peg the Hong Kong dollar with the US dollar at a rate of HK$7.8 to US$1 in a currency board fashion on 17 October 1983. When recalling the choice of rate, Tony Latter notes that a rate of HK$7.25 to HK$7.50 was considered a reasonable range in macroeconomic terms, given the rate against the US dollar around HK$6.60 before the crisis and the rate around HK$8.30 to HK$8.80 when the government's intention to change monetary regime was revealed in early October. In political terms, the government did not want to set the rate too weak so as to warrant international allegations of currency manipulation for competitive advantages, or too strong a rate that would result in high interest rates and the eventual abandonment of the rate. HK$7.8 was finally selected, as the government hoped to demonstrate that the situation has been properly stabilized and it was felt that the rate below HK$8.0 can achieve this purpose psychologically. John Bremridge was once quoted saying that the rate was somewhat \\"a number off the air\\", but the most important thing was the restoration of public confidence in Hong Kong dollar with the peg amidst the crisis. The solution in its current form was favored by government officials for reasons beyond monetary considerations. Financially, the currency peg was designed not to require the Bank of England to lend its reserves to maintain Hong Kong's currency peg. Politically, the currency board system well demonstrated the autonomy London has given to Hong Kong in economic policymaking amidst British negotiation with China to grant Hong Kong's higher autonomy after 1997. As envisioned, the currency board monetary regime continues to function with the same pegged rate beyond the handover of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Post-1997 Period The Basic Law of Hong Kong and the Sino-British Joint Declaration provides that Hong Kong retains full autonomy with respect to currency issuance. Currency in Hong Kong is issued by the government and three local banks (HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered) under the supervision of the territory's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Banknotes are printed by Hong Kong Note Printing Limited. A bank can issue a Hong Kong dollar only if it has the equivalent exchange in US dollars on deposit. The currency board system ensures that Hong Kong's entire monetary base is backed with US dollars at the linked exchange rate. The resources for the backing are kept in Hong Kong's exchange fund, which is among the largest official reserves in the world. Hong Kong also has huge deposits of US dollars, with official foreign currency reserves of US$361 billion as of March 2016.Hong Kong‚Äôs Latest Foreign Currency Reserve Assets Figures Released , Hong Kong Monetary Authority, April 2016 In a speech addressing the issue of who determines the monetary policy in Hong Kong on 13 May 2002, Tony Latter, in the position of the Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), contended that the Financial Secretary together with the HKMA in the Hong Kong SAR Government were responsible for that. He acknowledged the heavy and direct influence of the Federal Reserve of the United States on Hong Kong's monetary policy under the currency peg, but argued that \\"It was Hong Kong's choice, and we do not require any permission from Washington or New York to continue or discontinue it\\". As of 18 May 2005, in addition to the lower guaranteed limit, a new upper guaranteed limit was set for the Hong Kong dollar at HK$7.75 to the US dollar. The lower limit has been lowered from 7.80 to 7.85 (by 100 pips per week from 23 May to 20 June 2005). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority indicated this move is to narrow the gap between the interest rates in Hong Kong and those of the United States. A further aim of allowing the Hong Kong dollar to trade in a range is to avoid the HK dollar being used as a proxy for speculative bets on a renminbi revaluation.

A slang term in English sometimes used for the Hong Kong dollar is \\"Honkie\\".A Telling Move for the Hong Kong Dollar? , The Wall Street Journal, 30 December 2009 Coins Images of the coins of the Hong Kong dollar (Bauhinia series). In 1863, 1-mil (-cent), 1-cent and 10-cent coins were introduced, followed in 1866 by 5- and 20- cents, half-dollar and 1-dollar. The 1-mil and 1-cent were struck in bronze, with the 1 mil a holed coin. The remaining coins were struck in silver. Production of the 1-mil ended in 1866, whilst that of the half-dollar and 1-dollar ceased in 1868, with only the half-dollar (now with the denomination given as 50 cents) resuming production in 1890. Production of all silver coins was suspended in 1905, only briefly resumed in 1932 and 1933 for the production of 5-cent coins. In 1934, the last 1-cent coins were issued, but the last minting was 1941. These were not issued because the Japanese sank a ship carrying 1-cent coins bound for Hong Kong in the Second World War. The following year (1935), cupro-nickel 5 and 10 cents were introduced, replaced by nickel in 1937 and nickel-brass between 1948 and 1949. Copper-nickel 50 cents were issued in 1951 and first bore the name \\"fifty cents\\" in both Chinese and English, but these were changed to nickel-brass in 1977. In 1960, cupro-nickel 1-dollar coins were introduced, these were then reduced in size in 1978. They were followed in 1975 by nickel-brass 20 cents and cupro-nickel 2-dollar (both scallop shaped), and in 1976 by decagonal, cupro-nickel 5-dollar coin, changed to a round thicker shape in 1980. The 5-cent coin was last issued in 1979, but last struck in 1988. In 1994, a bimetallic 10-dollar coin was introduced. Starting in 1993, prior to the establishment of the HKSAR, coins with Queen Elizabeth II's portrait were gradually withdrawn from circulation. Most of the notes and coins in circulations feature Hong Kong's Bauhinia flower or other symbols. Coins with the Queen's portrait are still legal tender and can be seen, but these are slowly being phased out. However, most still remain in legal tender and are in circulation. Because the redesign was highly sensitive with regard to political and economic reasons, the designing process of the new coins could not be entrusted to an artist but was undertaken by Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, himself who found in the bauhinia the requested \\"politically neutral design\\" and did a secret \\"scissors and paste job\\".Joseph Yam's Viewpoint article, 18 November 1999, Joseph Yam's coin designs In 1997, to commemorate Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty from Britain to the PRC, the government issued a new commemorative coin set which depicted Chinese cultural themes and Hong Kong's landmarks and 19 and 97, marking the year 1997, on each side of the designs. As of today, coins in denominations of HK$10, HK$5, HK$2, HK$1, 50 cents, 20 cents and 10 cents are issued by Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government of Hong Kong. Banknotes The issue of Hong Kong dollar notes is governed today by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the governmental currency board of Hong Kong. Under licence from the HKMA, three commercial banks issue their own banknotes for general circulation in the region. They are Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited; the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited; and the Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited. Notes are also issued by the HKMA itself. In most countries of the world the issue of banknotes is handled exclusively by a single central bank or government. The arrangements in Hong Kong are unusual but not unique; a comparable system is used in the United Kingdom, where seven banks issue banknotes. As of today, the three commercial banks, HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered issue their own designs of banknotes in denominations of HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000, with all designs being similar to the other in the same denomination of banknote. While only the HK$10 banknote is issued solely by Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government of Hong Kong, which in total makes up the banknote circulation arrangement to four different note issuers. In 1845, the first private bank, the Oriental Bank, was founded. However, banknotes were not produced until the 1860s, when the Oriental Bank, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Company began issuing notes. Denominations issued in the 1860s and 1870s included 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 dollars. These notes were not accepted by the Treasury for payment of government dues and taxes, although they were accepted for use by merchants. 25 dollar notes did not survive beyond the end of the 19th century, whilst the 1-dollar notes (only produced by the HSBC) were issued until 1935. Under the Currency Ordinance of 1935, banknotes in denominations of 5 dollars and above issued by the three authorised local banks, the Mercantile Bank of India Limited, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, were all declared legal tender. The government took over production of 1 dollar notes. In 1941, the government introduced notes for 1, 5 and 10 cents due to the difficulty of transporting coins to Hong Kong caused by the Second World War (a ship carrying 1941 1-cent coins was sunk, making this unissued coin very rare). Just before the Japanese occupation, an emergency issue of 1 dollar notes was made consisting of overprinted Bank of China 5 yuan notes. In 1945, paper money production resumed essentially unaltered from before the war, with the government issuing 1, 5 and 10 cents, and 1-dollar notes, and the three banks issuing 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500-dollar notes. 1-dollar notes were replaced by coins in 1960, with only the 1-cent note issued by the government after 1965. In 1975, the 5-dollar notes were replaced by a coin, whilst 1,000-dollar notes were introduced in 1977. The Mercantile Bank was absorbed by the HSBC in 1978 and ceased issuing notes. In 1985, 20-dollar notes were introduced, whilst, in 1993, a 10-dollar coin was introduced and the banks stopped issuing 10 dollar notes. In 1994 the HKMA gave authority to the Bank of China to issue notes. After a less-than- successful trial from 1994 to 2002 to move the 10-dollar denomination from the banknote format (issued by the banks) to the coin format (Government-issued), 10 dollar banknotes are currently the only denomination issued by the HKMA, having acquired the note printing plant at Tai Po from the De La Rue Group of the UK on behalf of the Government. The older 10-dollar banknotes are, although rare and being phased out, still circulating. A commemorative polymer ten dollar note was issued in July 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. The new notes will circulate along with other issues for a trial period of two years, though the initial batch released was largely snapped up by collectors. A new series of banknotes was issued starting in 2010. In 2015, HSBC issued 150-dollar notes in celebration for its 150th anniversary. Economics Linked exchange rate system HKD/USD exchange rate since 1990 Since 1983, the linked exchange rate system is a unique type of exchange rate regime used for the Hong Kong dollar to be pegged with the United States dollar at a fixed rate of HK$7.80 = US$1. In this unique linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) authorises the three note-issuing banks (HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered) to issue new banknotes provided that they deposit an equivalent value of United States dollars with the HKMA. In practice, in the unique linked exchange rate system, the exchange rate of HK$7.80 = US$1, is strictly controlled by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in the foreign exchange market by controlling supply and demand of Hong Kong dollars in order to influence the exchange rate being fixed. By this arrangement the HKMA guarantees to exchange United States dollar into Hong Kong dollars and vice versa, at the rate of 7.80. When the market rate is below 7.80, the banks will convert United States dollar for Hong Kong dollars from the HKMA, Hong Kong dollars supply will increase, and the market rate will climb back to 7.80. The same mechanism also works when the market rate is above 7.80, and the banks will convert Hong Kong dollars for United States dollars. By this arrangement, the Hong Kong dollar is backed by one of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, which is over 7 times the amount of money supplied in circulation or about 48% of Hong Kong dollar M3 at the end of April 2016. Renminbi peg debate Following the Internationalization of the renminbi and the inclusion of the Renminbi in the special drawing rights, there has been debates to peg the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi, instead of the United States dollar. Studies shows that, if the Hong Kong dollar were to be re-pegged to the Renminbi, it would need over 2 trillion Renminbi worth of assets to replace the HKMA's US$340 billion in foreign reserves as of 2015, which exceeds the amount of existing Renminbi assets in Hong Kong's offshore market. Moreover, according to figures from the HKMA as of the end of 2014, Renminbi deposits and certificates of deposits stood at 1.158 trillion Renminbi, while outstanding Renminbi bonds amounted to 381 billion and Renminbi-denominated loans stood at 188 billion. Other studies shows, while the Hong Kong's financial and economic links are increasingly dominated by mainland China, and previous concerns about the openness of China's capital account are slowly receding, if China continues to open its capital account, the peg could shift from United States dollar to renminbi. However, in January 2016, the volatility in the Renminbi and China's financial markets expanded to Hong Kong's markets and its currency. Renminbi offshore overnight borrowing rate, CNH HIBOR, soared to 66.8% on 12 January after People's Bank of China ‚Äì China's central bank (PBOC) intervened in the effort of squeezing out Renminbi short speculations by tightening liquidity at Hong Kong commercial banks. The PBOC's move at the offshore market, coupled with another plunge in Chinese stocks, has led to investors‚Äô fears that the Hong Kong Dollar may be de-pegged from the US Dollar in the foreseeable future. In response to the market speculation, Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on 27 January that the regulator will protect Hong Kong dollar's linked exchange rate regime. Yet, many investors no longer consider Hong Kong as a safe haven as they once had given increasing financial influence by mainland China. As Hong Kong's financial markets are highly impacted by mainland China, the Renminbi exchange rate as well as China's equity market remain in a state of high volatility and continues to weigh on Hong Kong markets and the Hong Kong dollar.

Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forl√¨, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region). The region has been recently formally expanded with the transfer of seven comuni (Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant'Agata Feltria, Talamello) from the Marche region, which are a small number of comuni where Romagnolo dialect is spoken. Etymology The name Romagna originates from the Latin name Romania, which originally was the generic name for \\"land inhabited by Romans\\", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century. It later took on the more specific meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (Romani in Latin; , Rhoma√Æoi in Greek). Thus the term Romania came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named Langobardia or Lombardy. History The Caveja, the symbol of Romagna Prehistory A number of archaeological sites in the region, such as Monte Poggiolo, show that Romagna has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age. Umbri and Gauls The Umbri, speaking an extinct Italic language called Umbrian, are the first traceable inhabitants of the region. The Etruscans also dwelt in some portions of Romagna. In the 5th Century BC, various Gaulish tribes, most notably the Lingones, Senoni and Boii, moved south into Italy, and sacked Rome in 390 BC. The Senoni utterly subjugated the Umbri and settled in Romagna. The Senoni extended further south to Ancona, with their capital Sena Gallica (Senigallia). The lands formerly inhabited by the Senoni were known as ager Gallicus (Gallic plain) to the Romans. According to the Italian linguist Giacomo Devoto, there are still a number of Celtic substrata in the Romagnolo dialect. Roman Republic Gallic predominance in the region was consistently challenged by the Romans. In the battle of Telamon, the Romans defeated the joint forces of the Celtic tribes, thus achieving a hegemony over the new Roman Province of Cisalpine Gaul centred at Mutina (modern Modena). After the Second Punic War, the pro-Carthaginian Lingones and Senoni were expelled. To consolidate the Roman rule in the region, the Via Aemilia was built from Ariminium (Rimini) to Piacentia (Piacenza), and a series of Roman colonies were founded. The most significant ones are Forum Livii (Forl√¨), Forum Cornelii (Imola) and Forum Popili (Forlimpopoli). After the Social War, the Lex Julia was introduced in 90 BC, and Roman citizenship was granted to all municipia south of the River Po. In the first Roman civil war, between Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla, most cities in the regions supported Marius. As a result, Forum Livii and Caesena were razed to ground, and the region was looted by Sulla's army. During the first triumvirate, the Roman Republic was divided along the infamous Rubicon. Most of modern Romagna was ruled by Julius Caesar, the notable exception of Ariminium, which is south of the river. In 49 BC, Caesar, who was residing in Ravenna then, led the Legio XIII across the Rubicon and ignited Caesar's civil war. Roman Empire After the decisive battle of Actium, Augustus started a century-long era of Pax Romana. All of Cisalpine Gaul had been incorporated into the Roman province of Italia. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided all of Italy into eleven regiones, and most of Romagna (except Rimini) was in the eighth, Aemilia. By the beginning of the 3rd Century, Diocletian re-divided the Empire into four prefectures, each divided into dioceses, and into provinces. Under the new system, Italy was demoted to a mere Imperial province. Modern Romagna was organized into the Roman province of Flaminia et Picenum in the diocese of Italia Annonaria. Steadily Ravenna, which was surrounded by swamps and marshes, prospered and rose in importance, and a Roman fleet was based at the city. It had developed into a major port on the Adriatic. However, in 330, the capital of the Empire was transferred to Constantinople, so with the fleet that stationed at Ravenna, thus weakened the coastal defence in the Adriatic. Germanic migrations and Exarchate of Ravenna Stepping into the 5th Century, the Germanic migrations into the Empire further intensified. In 402, Emperor Honorius even moved the Western Roman Empire's capital from Mediolanum to Ravenna, mainly because of the region's defensive terrain. 8 years later, Alaric I of the Visigoths looted Rome. In 476, Odoacer deposed Romulus in Ravenna, thus marking an end to the Western Empire. Encouraged by Emperor Zeno, Theodoric the Great led the Ostrogoths into Italy. He entered Ravenna and murdered Odoacer in 493, establishing a twofold kingdom of the Romans and Goths. Under the Ostrogoths Italy was partly restored to its former prosperity. In 535 Justinian I initiated the Gothic War. It was fought for 20 years, and the Ostrogoths were finally subjugated. The peninsula, depopulated and devastated, was ruled by an exarch from Ravenna. However, Imperial authority was maintained for barely more than a decade. In 568 new Germanic tribes, the Lombards, entered Italy, and established their capital at Pavia. The Empire could barely defend the region around Ravenna and Rome, connected by a narrow strip of land passing through Perugia, as well as a series of coastal cities. The Imperial frontier retreated to Bologna. In 727 the Lombard King Liutprand renewed war against the Byzantines, taking most of Romagna and besieging Ravenna itself. These territories were returned to the Byzantines in 730. In 737 the king entered Romagna once more and took Ravenna. The exarch, Eutychius, retook the region in 740, with Venetian assistance. Eventually another Lombard king, Aistulf, conquered Romagna once more, and brought an end to the exarchate in 751. Abbazia di San Mercuriale, Forl√¨, built in 1180 Papal rule King Rudolf I of Germany officially ceded Romagna to the Papal States in 1278. However, Papal control over the area long remained only nominal. The region was divided among a series of regional lords, such as the Ordelaffi of Forl√¨ or the Malatesta of Rimini, many of them adhering to the Ghibelline party in opposition to the pro-papal Guelphs. This situation started to change in the late-15th century, when after their return to Rome from Avignon in 1378, stronger popes progressively reasserted their authority in the fragmented region. Parts of Romagna were also seized by other powers, including Venice, and most notably the Republic of Florence, which took land up to Forl√¨ and Cervia, building the famous city-fortress of Terra del Sole. The Florentine Romagna remained part of Tuscany until the 1920s. Paolo da Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini surprised by Gianciotto Malatesta (1805), depicting a historical event from around 1280 Romagna in the 17th century In 1500 Cesare Borgia, illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI, carved out for himself an ephemeral Duchy of Romagna, but his lands were reabsorbed into the Papal States after his fall. In 1559 the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis divided Romagna between the Farnese family of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, the House of Este of the Ferrara, and the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, and the Papal States. The Duchy of Ferrara was later annexed by the Papal States on the extinction of the main d'Este line in 1597, with the cadet branch retaining the Imperial fiefs of Modena and Reggio. This situation lasted until the French invasion of 1796, which brought bloodshed (the massacre of Lugo, looting, heavy taxation, the destruction of Cesena University) but also innovative ideas in social and political fields. Under Napoleonic rule Romagna received recognition as an entity for the first time, with the creation of the provinces of the Pino (Ravenna) and Rubicone (Forl√¨). When in 1815 the Congress of Vienna restored the pre-war situation, secret anti-Papal societies were formed, and riots broke out in 1820, 1830‚Äì31 and 1848. This opposition was fuelled by the Mazzinian propaganda and the direct action of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Men like Felice Orsini, Piero Maroncelli and Aurelio Saffi were among the protagonists of the Italian Risorgimento. Piazza del Popolo in Cesena In a re-united Italy However, after joining the unification of Italy in 1860, Romagna was not awarded separate status by the Savoy monarchs, who were afraid of dangerous destabilizing tendencies in the wake of the popular figures cited above. In the early 20th century the autonomy of Romagna was advocated by Aldo Spallicci, Giuseppe Fuschini, Emilio Lussu and others. A movement proposing separation from Emilia-Romagna was created in the 1990s.

In Greek it is a plural form. The largest islands are Paxos and Antipaxos.

In Greek mythology, Poseidon created the island by striking Corfu with his trident, so that he and his wife Amphitrite could have some peace and quiet. History Although it was possibly inhabited from prehistoric times, the Phoenicians are traditionally held to have been the first settlers on Paxos. The name is believed to be derived from Pax, which meant trapezoidal in their language. This island is noted for the Battle of Paxos, fought between the ancient Greek and Illyrian fleets during the First Illyrian War in 229 BC. The battle is recorded by the ancient historian Polybius (The Histories, book 2, chapter 2). The Romans ruled the island from the 2nd century BC, and during the Byzantine period and Middle Ages it was constantly attacked by pirates. After various rulers and Crusaders had passed through, the island was taken by the Venetians at the end of the 14th century. During the Napoleonic wars, the Ionian Islands were taken by the French and the Russo-Turkish alliance. On 13 February 1814, the island of Paxos surrendered to the Royal Navy frigate HMS Apollo and 160 troops from the 2nd Greek Light Infantry from Cephalonia and the 35th Regiment of the Royal Corsican Rangers. In 1815, the United Kingdom established the Ionian Union. In 1864, together with the rest of the Heptanese, Paxos was ceded to Greece. Geography The island is approximately in length and tipped up towards the west. The west coast is dominated by steep white, chalky cliffs that are greatly eroded at sea level, and harbour many 'blue caves', which can be explored on launches departing from Gaios. Much of the attractive landscape is still covered in olive groves. These stretch from Lakka, the harbour community in the north, through Magazia to Gaios, the capital. Olive oil making, soap manufacture and fishing were supplanted by tourism as the main industry in the mid sixties, resulting in a construction boom, which has greatly altered the coastline around Gaios, the capital of the Paxiot demos (community). There are ferry and jetfoil connections daily with Kerkyra (Corfu) and with the mainland at Igoumenitsa. Excursions via Corfu to Albania (the resort of Saranda and the magnificent Greco-Roman settlement of Butrint) can also be arranged with the local jetfoil operators. left Province The province of Paxoi () was one of the provinces of the Corfu Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Paxoi. It was abolished in 2006. Foreign residents Among well known semi-permanent British inhabitants were Audrey Good, former commander of the UN refugee bases in Epirus following the Greek Civil War, the late actor Peter Bull (author of It Isn't All Greek to Me) and actress Susannah York. Some members of the Agnelli family (of FIAT fame) have built a palatial holiday home‚Äîcomplete with faux medieval tower‚Äîon a small island (Kaltonisi) situated near the southernmost tip ('the heel') of Paxos, close to the beach of Mongonissi. The presence of such residents, and the development of the coastal area (mostly by Italian nationals) explains why Paxos has now become one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Greece. Paxos is part of a European network called Cultural Village of Europe. The annual Paxos Festival was founded by John Gough, and is now organised by the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, and attracts some of Europe's finest young performers. This festival events usually take place between June to September and are usually held in the disused school of Longos. Transport The island is serviced by ferry boats from the mainland Greece port of Igoumenitsa (1.5 hours), hydrofoils and ferry boats from Corfu (1-2 hours) and from Bari and Brindisi (4 hours). There is no airport but there was a privately owned seaplane service (7 minutes from Corfu town) operated by AirSea Lines. As of late 2009, this service is no-longer operational. Dialect A dialect is spoken resembling that of Corfu and having a similar prosody. It is heavily influenced by Italian.

Formally, one dollar () is divided into ten dimes (), and to 100 cents (), although cents are never used in practice. The New Taiwan dollar has been the currency of Taiwan since 1949, when it replaced the Old Taiwan dollar, at a rate of 40,000 old dollars per one new dollar. There are a variety of alternative names to the units in Taiwan. The unit of dollar is typically informally written with the simpler equivalent character as , except when writing it for legal transactions such as at the bank, when it has to be written as . Colloquially, the currency unit is called (ku√†i, literally \\"piece\\") in Mandarin, (khoÕò, literally \\"hoop\\") in Taiwanese Hokkien, and (ngi√πn, literally \\"silver\\") in Hakka. The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), which has been the central bank of Taiwan since 2000, issues the New Taiwan dollar. While the Bank of Taiwan issued banknotes prior to 2000, it was also the de facto central bank between 1949 and 1961.

These contexts include banking, contracts, or foreign exchange. The currency unit name can be written in or , which are interchangeable. They are both pronounced yu√°n in Mandarin. But they have different pronunciations in Taiwanese Hokkien (√Æ‚Åø, go√¢n) and Hakka (y√®n, ngi√®n). The name in Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka for cent is likely from the hundredth unit (sen) of Japanese era Taiwanese yen or from English. In English usage, the New Taiwan dollar is often abbreviated as NT, NT$, or NT dollar, while the abbreviation TWD is typically used in the context of foreign exchange rates. Subdivisions of a New Taiwan dollar are rarely used, since practically all products on the consumer market are sold in whole dollars. Nevertheless, banks do record cents (hundredth of dollar). History The New Taiwan dollar was first issued by the Bank of Taiwan on 15 June 1949, to replace the Old Taiwan dollar at a ratio of 40,000 to one. The first goal of the New Taiwan dollar was to end the hyperinflation that had plagued Nationalist China due to the Chinese Civil War. After the communists captured Beijing in January 1949, the Nationalists began to retreat to Taiwan. China's gold reserve was moved to Taiwan in February 1949. The government then declared in the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion that dollars issued by the Bank of Taiwan would become the new currency in circulation. Even though the New Taiwan dollar was the de facto currency of Taiwan, for years the silver yuan remained the legal currency. The value of the silver yuan was decoupled from the value of silver during World War II. Many older statutes have fines and fees given in this currency. According to statute, one silver yuan is worth three New Taiwan dollars.s:Regulation of exchange rate between new Taiwan dollars and the fiat currency in the ROC laws Despite decades of inflation, this ratio has not been adjusted. This made the silver yuan a purely notational currency long ago, nearly impossible to buy, sell, or use. When the Temporary Provisions were made ineffective in 1991, the ROC lacked a legal national currency until the year 2000, when the Central Bank of China (CBC) replaced the Bank of Taiwan in issuing NT bills. In July 2000, the New Taiwan dollar became Taiwan's legal currency. It is no longer secondary to the silver yuan. At this time, the central bank began issuing New Taiwan dollar banknotes, and the notes issued earlier by the Bank of Taiwan were taken out of circulation. The exchange rate compared to the United States dollar has varied from less than ten to one in the mid-1950s, more than forty to one in the 1960s, and about twenty-five to one in 1992. The exchange rate as of December 2019 is NT$30.37 per US$.

Both are run by the Central Bank. The NT$ coin is rare because of its low value, while the NT$20 coin is rare because of the government's lack of willingness to promote it. As of 2010, the cost of the raw materials in a NT$ coin was more than the face value of the coin. Banknotes The current series of banknotes for the New Taiwan dollar began circulation in July 2000. This set was introduced when the New Taiwan dollar succeeded the silver yuan as the official currency within Taiwan. The current set includes banknotes for NT$100, NT$200, NT$500, NT$1000, and NT$2000. Note that the NT$200 and NT$2000 banknotes are not commonly used by consumers. This may be due to the tendencies of consumers to simply use multiple NT$100 or NT$500 bills to cover the range of the NT$200, as well as using NT$1000 bills or credit/debit cards instead of the NT$2000 bill. Lack of government promotion may also be a contributing factor to the general lack of usage. It is relatively easy for the government to disseminate these denominations through various government bodies that do official business with the citizens, such as the post office, the tax authority, or state owned banks. There is also a conspiracy theory against the Democratic Progressive Party, the ruling party at the time the two denominations were issued.

An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report. Practitioners sometimes use the terms \\"watchdog reporting\\" or \\"accountability reporting\\". Most investigative journalism has traditionally been conducted by newspapers, wire services, and freelance journalists. With the decline in income through advertising, many traditional news services have struggled to fund investigative journalism, which is time-consuming and therefore expensive. Journalistic investigations are increasingly carried out by news organizations working together, even internationally (as in the case of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers), or by organizations such as ProPublica, which have not operated previously as news publishers and which rely on the support of the public and benefactors to fund their work. The growth of media conglomerates in the U.S. since the 1980s has been accompanied by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded \\"that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves\\"., citing The empirical evidence for this is consistent with the conflicts of interest between the revenue sources for the media conglomerates and the mythology of an unbiased, dispassionate media: advertisers have reduced their spending with media that reported too many unfavorable details. The major media conglomerates have found ways to retain their audience without the risks of offending advertisers inherent in investigative journalism.  Professional definitions  University of Missouri journalism professor Steve Weinberg defined investigative journalism as: \\"Reporting, through one's own initiative and work product, matters of importance to readers, viewers, or listeners.\\" In many cases, the subjects of the reporting wish the matters under scrutiny to remain undisclosed. There are currently university departments for teaching investigative journalism. Conferences are conducted presenting peer reviewed research into investigative British media theorist Hugo de Burgh (2000) states that: \\"An investigative journalist is a man or woman whose profession is to discover the truth and to identify lapses from it in whatever media may be available. The act of doing this generally is called investigative journalism and is distinct from apparently similar work done by police, lawyers, auditors, and regulatory bodies in that it is not limited as to target, not legally founded and closely connected to publicity.\\" Terminology American journalism textbooks point out that muckraking standards promoted by McClure's Magazine around 1902, \\"Have become integral to the character of modern investigative journalism.\\" Furthermore, the successes of the early muckrakers continued to inspire journalists.  Tools  An investigative reporter may make use of one or more of these tools, among others, on a single story: * Analysis of documents, such as lawsuits and other legal documents, tax records, government reports, regulatory reports, and corporate financial filings. * Databases of public records. * Investigation of technical issues, including scrutiny of government and business practices and their effects. * Research into social and legal issues. * Subscription research sources such as LexisNexis. * Numerous interviews with on-the-record sources as well as, in some instances, interviews with anonymous sources (for example whistleblowers). * Federal or state Freedom of Information Acts to obtain documents and data from government agencies. Examples * Julius Chambers of the New-York Tribune had himself committed to the Bloomingdale Asylum in 1872, and his account led to the release of twelve patients who were not mentally ill, a reorganization of the staff and administration, and eventually to a change in the lunacy laws; this later led to the publication of the book A Mad World and Its Inhabitants (1876). *Ida B. Wells-Barnett's 1892 Southern Horrors documented lynching in the United States, exposing in the pages of black-owned newspapers as a campaign of oppression and intimidation against African Americans. A white mob destroyed her newspaper press and office in retaliation for her reporting. *Nellie Bly, a pseudonym used by Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman in the late 19th century, famously feigned insanity as part of her 1887 undercover investigation into and subsequent expos√© regarding the inner-workings of the Women's Lunatic Asylum in New York City. Published to wide acclaim as a series of articles in the New York World which were later compiled and further detailed in her book Ten Days in a Mad- House, Bly's revelations led to both a grand jury investigation of the asylum and increased funding for the Department of Public Charities and Corrections. *Bill Dedman's 1988 investigation, The Color of Money, for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on racial discrimination by mortgage lenders in middle- income neighborhoods, received the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting and was an influential early example of computer-assisted reporting or database journalism. *Brian Deer's British press award-winning investigation for The Sunday Times of London into the worldwide MMR vaccine controversy which revealed that research, published by The Lancet, associating the children's vaccine with autism was fraudulent. *The Daily Telegraph investigated claims that various British Members of Parliament had been filing dubious and frivolous expenses claims, and had done for many years in secret. The House of Commons Authority initially tried to block the release of the information, but the expenses were leaked to the Telegraph. The newspaper then released pieces of information which dominated the news for weeks and caused considerable anger in the UK. *John M. Crewdson of the Chicago Tribune wrote a 1996 article proposing the installment of defibrillators on American airliners. Crewdson argued that based on his research and analysis, \\"Medical kits and defibrillators would be economically justified if they saved just 3 lives each year.\\" Soon after the article's publication, airlines began installing defibrillators on planes, and the devices began to show up in airports and other public spaces. Ten years after installing defibrillators, American Airlines reported that 80 lives had been saved by the machines. *Trappalachia investigative journalist Davin Eldridgehttp://trappalachia.com/index.php/about/ has taken on an entire region's worth of political corruption now for several years, without any open support from fellow journalists due to the implications their news outlets would face. Eldridge's work helped one of North Carolina's poorest communities to recoup some of the monies stolen from it by a former official.http://trappalachia.com/index.php/2019/07/27/robbing-from-the-poor- given-impunity-by-the-rich/ The reporter has also been unapologetic in his coverage of local media and its shortcomings, biases and possible complicities in corruption or injustice throughout the region.http://trappalachia.com/index.php/2020/04/08/judges-unanimously-rule- on-da-threats/ *One of the largest teams of investigative journalists is the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) launched in 1997 by the Center for Public Integrity which includes 165 investigative reporters in over 65 countries working collaboratively on crime, corruption, and abuse of power at a global level, under Gerard Ryle as Director. Working with major media outlets globally, they have exposed organised crime, international tobacco companies, private military cartels, asbestos companies, climate change lobbyists, details of Iraq and Afghanistan war contracts, and most recently the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers. * Hopewell Chin'ono, the award winning Zimbabwean journalist who investigated and exposed the Covid-gate scandal in Zimbabwe in June 2020.

Like the Empire of Trebizond and the Empire of Thessalonica, it claimed to be the continuation of the Roman Empire. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. History Foundation In 1204, Byzantine emperor Alexios V Ducas Murtzouphlos fled Constantinople after crusaders invaded the city. Soon after, Theodore I Lascaris, the son-in-law of Emperor Alexios III Angelos, was proclaimed emperor but he too, realizing the situation in Constantinople was hopeless, fled to the city of Nicaea in Bithynia. The Latin Empire, established by the Crusaders in Constantinople, had poor control over former Byzantine territory, and Greek successor states of the Byzantine Empire sprang up in Epirus, Trebizond, and Nicaea. Trebizond had broken away as an independent state a few weeks before the fall of Constantinople.Michael Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 1. Greek text in Original-Fragmente, Chroniken, Inschiften und anderes Materiale zur Geschichte des Kaiserthums Trapezunt, part 2; in Abhandlungen der historischen Classe der k√∂niglich bayerischen Akademie 4 (1844), abth. 1, pp. 11; German translation, p. 41 Nicaea, however, was the closest to the Latin Empire and was in the best position to attempt to re-establish the Byzantine Empire. Theodore Lascaris was not immediately successful, as Henry of Flanders defeated him at Poimanenon and Prusa (now Bursa) in 1204, but Theodore was able to capture much of northwestern Anatolia after the defeat of Latin Emperor Baldwin I in the Battle of Adrianople, Henry was recalled to Europe to defend against invasions from Kaloyan of Bulgaria.Alice Gardiner, The Lascarids of Nicaea: The Story of an Empire in Exile, 1912, (Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert, 1964), pp. 75‚Äì78 Theodore also defeated an army from Trebizond, as well as other minor rivals, leaving him in charge of the most powerful of the successor states. In 1206, Theodore proclaimed himself emperor at Nicaea. Numerous truces and alliances were formed and broken over the next few years, as the Byzantine successor states, the Latin Empire, the Bulgarians, and the Seljuks of Iconium (whose territory also bordered Nicaea) fought each other. In 1211, at Antioch on the Meander, Theodore defeated a major invasion by the Seljuks, who were backing a bid by Alexios III Angelos to return to power. The losses suffered at Antioch, however, led to a defeat at the hands of the Latin Empire at the Rhyndacus River and the loss of most of Mysia and the Marmara Sea coast in the subsequent Treaty of Nymphaeum. The Nicaeans were compensated for this territorial loss when, in 1212, the death of David Komnenos allowed their annexation of his lands in Paphlagonia. Theodore consolidated his claim to the imperial throne by naming a new Patriarch of Constantinople in Nicaea. In 1219, he married the daughter of Latin Empress Yolanda of Flanders, but he died in 1222 and was succeeded by his son-in-law John III Ducas Vatatzes. Expansion Nicaea city wall, Lefke gate; Iznik, Turkey The accession of Vatatzes was initially challenged by the Laskarids, with the sebastokratores Isaac and Alexios, brothers of Theodore I, seeking the aid of the Latin Empire. Vatatzes prevailed over their combined forces, however, in the Battle of Poimanenon, securing his throne and regaining almost all of the Asian territories held by the Latin Empire in the process. In 1224, the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica was captured by the Despot of Epirus Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who crowned himself emperor in rivalry to Vatatzes and established the Empire of Thessalonica. It proved short-lived, as it came under Bulgarian control after the Battle of Klokotnitsa in 1230. With Trebizond lacking any real power, Nicaea was the only Byzantine state left, and John III expanded his territory across the Aegean Sea. In 1235, he allied with Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, allowing him to extend his influence over Thessalonica and Epirus. In 1242, the Mongols invaded Seljuk territory to the east of Nicaea, and although John III was worried they might attack him next, they ended up eliminating the Seljuk threat to Nicaea. In 1245, John allied with the Holy Roman Empire by marrying Constance II of Hohenstaufen, daughter of Frederick II. In 1246, John attacked Bulgaria and recovered most of Thrace and Macedonia, and proceeded to incorporate Thessalonica into his realm. By 1248, John had defeated the Bulgarians and surrounded the Latin Empire. He continued to take land from the Latins until his death in 1254. Theodore II Lascaris, John III's son, faced invasions from the Bulgarians in Thrace, but successfully defended the territory. A conflict between Nicaea and Epirus broke out in 1257. Epirus allied with Manfred of Sicily when Theodore II died in 1258. John IV Lascaris succeeded him, but as he was still a child he was under the regency of the general Michael Palaeologus. Michael proclaimed himself co-emperor (as Michael VIII) in 1259, and soon defeated a combined invasion by Manfred, the Despot of Epirus, and the Latin Prince of Achaea at the Battle of Pelagonia. Recapture of Constantinople Coin issued by Michael VIII Palaeologus to celebrate the liberation of Constantinople from the Latin army, and the restoration of the Roman/Byzantine Empire. In 1260, Michael began the assault on Constantinople itself, which his predecessors had been unable to do. He allied with Genoa, and his general Alexios Strategopoulos spent months observing Constantinople in order to plan his attack. In July 1261, as most of the Latin army was fighting elsewhere, Alexius was able to convince the guards to open the gates of the city. Once inside he burned the Venetian quarter (as Venice was an enemy of Genoa, and had been largely responsible for the capture of the city in 1204). Michael was recognized as emperor a few weeks later, restoring the Byzantine Empire. Achaea was soon recaptured, but Trebizond and Epirus remained independent Byzantine Greek states. The restored empire also faced a new threat from the Ottomans, when they arose to replace the Seljuks. Aftermath After 1261, Constantinople once more became the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The territories of the former Empire of Nicaea were stripped of their wealth, which was used to rebuild Constantinople and to fund numerous wars in Europe against the Latin states and Epirus. Soldiers were transferred from Asia Minor to Europe, leaving the old frontier relatively undefended. Raids by Turkish ghazis were left unchecked, and the frontier was increasingly overrun. The usurpation of the legitimate Laskarid ruler John IV Laskaris by Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261 alienated much of the populace against the restored Byzantine Empire at Constantinople. John IV was left behind at Nicaea, and was later blinded on Michael's orders on his eleventh birthday, December 25, 1261. This made him ineligible for the throne, and he was exiled and imprisoned in a fortress in Bithynia. This action led to the excommunication of Michael VIII Palaiologos by the Patriarch Arsenius Autoreianus, and a later revolt led by a Pseudo-John IV near Nicaea. The subsequent history of the former territory of the Empire of Nicaea is one of gradual conquest by the Turks. After the death of Michael VIII in 1282, Turkish raids turned into permanent settlement and the establishment of Turkish beyliks on former Byzantine territory. While the emperor Andronikos II made some efforts to retrieve the situation, these were unsuccessful. By c. 1300, nearly the whole of the former Empire of Nicaea had been conquered by the Turks, with only a tiny strip of territory directly opposite Constantinople clinging on. The final end of Byzantine Asia Minor came with the fall of Bursa in 1326, Nicaea in 1331 and Nicomedia in 1337. Military The Nicaean Empire consisted of Byzantium's most highly populated Greek region, with the exception of Thrace which was under Latin/Bulgar control. As such, the Empire was able to raise a reasonably numerous military force of around 20,000 soldiers at its height ‚Äì numbers recorded as participating in its numerous wars against the Crusader states. The Nicaeans continued some aspects of the Komnenian army, but without the resources available to the Komnenian emperors the Nicaean Byzantines could not match the numbers, nor the quality, of the armies that the emperor Manuel and his predecessors had fielded. Western Asia Minor had access to the sea, making it wealthier than most of the splinter states around and in time became the most powerful state in the region, if only for a short period. Ideology and Hellenism The court of the Nicaean state widely used the term \\"Hellenes\\" instead of the earlier \\"Romans\\" to describe its Greek population. Contemporaries preferred the use of \\"Hellas\\" or the adjective \\"Hellenikon\\" for the Empire of Nicaea. As such, Emperor Theodore Laskaris replaces the terms Romaioi (Romans) and Graikoi by Hellenes. Emperor Theodore II describes his realm as the new Hellas. Partiarch Germanos II used in official correspondence with the western world the term: \\"Graikoi\\" to describe the local population and \\"Empire of the Greeks\\" () as the name of the state. During that time there was a concerted ethnic Greek self-identification initiative. Some scholars see the Nicene empire period as an indication of rising ethnic Hellenic consciousness and Greek nationalism. However, these scholars caution that a rise in ethnic consciousness did not affect the official imperial ideology.Angelov, Dimiter. Imperial ideology and political thought in Byzantium (1204‚Äì1330). Cambridge: University Press, 2007. p. 95 Also Kaldellis, Anthony. Hellenism in Byzantium : the transformations of Greek identity and the reception of the classical tradition. Cambridge: University Press, 2007. In the official ideology, the traditional view of Byzantium as the Roman Empire was not overturned, as the usage of the word Rhomaioi for subjects of the Nicene emperors demonstrates. The official ideology of the Nicene Empire was one of reconquest and militarism, which was not to be seen in later 14th-century Palaiologan rhetoric.Angelov, pp. 99‚Äì101 The ideology of 13th-century Nicaea was characterized by belief in the continued significance of Constantinople and the hope to recapture the city, drawing less on claims of political universalism or Hellenic nationalism than on Old Testament ideas of Jewish providence. The emperor in this period is frequently compared to MosesAngold, Michael. A Byzantine government in exile : government and society under the Laskarids of Nicaea, 1204‚Äì1261. London: Oxford University Press, 1975. p. 13 or Zorobabel, or even as the ‚ÄúPillar of Fire‚Äù that guides God‚Äôs people to the Promised Land, e.g. in a speech delivered by Theodore I Laskaris, written by Niketas Choniates.Angelov, p. 99 The rhetoric of this period also glorified war and the reconquest of Constantinople using images not drawn from the Old Testament. For example, in his panegyric of Theodore I Laskarsis, Choniates describes a battle with a Seljuk sultan as a battle between Christianity and Islam, rhetorically comparing the wounds of Theodore, who had himself slain an enemy commander, to those of Christ on the cross.Angelov, p. 100 Dimiter Angelov suggests that western crusading ideology may have influenced the development of this view on reconquest, and during this period there is mention that Patriarch Michael IV Autoreianos offered full remission of sins to Nicene troops about to enter battle, a practice almost identical to a western plenary indulgence. However, the granting of such indulgences was short lived, and many of the possible crusader influences seem to have dropped off after 1211. The Byzantines of the 13th century also drew parallels between the situation of the empire after 1204 and that of Classical Greeks. This evidence has helped to strengthen the view of some scholars, such as A. E. Vacalopoulos, who see these references, combined with a re-evaluation of Byzantium's classical past, to be the genesis of Greek nationalism.Angold, Michael. \\"Byzantine ‚ÄòNationalism‚Äô and the Nicaean Empire.\\" Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, 1 (1975) pp. 51‚Äì52 With the loss of Constantinople, this comparison played on the idea of \\"Hellenes\\" surrounded by barbarians; Choniates equated the Seljuk sultan killed by Theodore I with Xerxes, and patriarch Germanos II recalled the victory of John III Vatatzes as another battle of Marathon or Salamis.Angold, p. 29 In much the same way, Theodore II Laskaris compared his father's victories to those of Alexander the Great and proceeded to extol the martial values of contemporary \\"Hellenes\\".Angelov, p. 97 In addition, during this period there seems to have been a shift in how the word \\"Hellene\\" was used in Byzantine parlance. Up to this point, \\"Hellene\\" had borne a negative connotation and was in particular associated with the remnants of paganism. In this period, however, both the terms \\"Graikoi\\" and \\"Hellenes\\" appear to enter into the diplomatic usage of the empire as a form of religious and ethnic self-identification, spurred by a desire to differentiate the empire and its citizens from the Latins.Angelov, pp. 96‚Äì97 Patriarch Germanus II of Constantinople in particular exemplifies this new vision of ethnic and religious identity. His letters equate good birth with the purity of his Hellenistic ancestry, placing more value in his Hellenistic linguistic and ethnic background than in any association with Constantinople, and showing his contempt for the Latins who prided themselves on possessing the city. There is a debate among scholars regarding the exact timing of the shift in meaning of the word Hellene. Roderick Beaton, considering the evidence of the usage of the term \\"Hellenes\\" in the 12th century, sees the re-evaluation of the term as occurring before the loss of Constantinople in 1204.

It is the third largest of the Ionian Islands. Zakynthos is a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region, and its only municipality. It covers an area of and its coastline is roughly in length. The name, like all similar names ending in , is pre-Mycenaean or Pelasgian in origin. In Greek mythology the island was said to be named after Zakynthos, the son of the legendary Arcadian chief Dardanus. Zakynthos is a tourist destination, with an international airport served by charter flights from northern Europe. The island's nickname is \\"the Flower of the Levant\\", bestowed upon it by the Venetians who were in possession of Zakynthos from 1484 to 1797. History Flag of Zakynthos, displaying an ancient depiction of the founding hero Z√°kynthos. The quote underneath reads: \\"Freedom requires virtue and bravery\\", a famous verse by 19th century Zakynthian poet Andreas Kalvos. Statue of Dionysios Solomos with the Byzantine museum in the background Ancient history The ancient Greek poet Homer mentioned Zakynthos in the Iliad and the Odyssey, stating that its first inhabitants were the son of King Dardanos of Arcadia, called Zakynthos, and his men. Before being renamed Zakynthos, the island was said to have been called Hyrie. Zakynthos was then conquered by King Arkesios of Kefalonia, and then by Odysseus from Ithaca. Zakynthos participated in the Trojan War and is listed in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships which, if accurate, describes the geopolitical situation in early Greece at some time between the Late Bronze Age and the eighth century BCE. In the Odyssey, Homer mentions 20 nobles from Zakynthos among a total of 108 of Penelope's suitors. The Athenian military commander Tolmides concluded an alliance with Zakynthos during the First Peloponnesian War sometime between 459 and 446 BC. In 430 BC, the Lacedaemonians made an unsuccessful attack upon Zakynthos. The Zakynthians are then enumerated among the autonomous allies of Athens in the disastrous Sicilian expedition. After the Peloponnesian War, Zakynthos seems to have passed under the supremacy of Sparta because in 374 BC, Timotheus, an Athenian commander, on his return from Kerkyra, landed some Zakynthian exiles on the island and assisted them in establishing a fortified post. These exiles must have belonged to the anti-Spartan party as the Zakynthian rulers applied for help to the Spartans who sent a fleet of 25 to the island. The importance of this alliance for Athens was that it provided them with a source of tar. Tar is a more effective protector of ship planking than pitch (which is made from pine trees). The Athenian trireme fleet needed protection from rot, decay and the teredo, so this new source of tar was valuable to them. The tar was dredged up from the bottom of a lake (now known as Lake Keri) using leafy myrtle branches tied to the ends of poles. It was then collected in pots and could be carried to the beach and swabbed directly onto ship hulls. Alternatively, the tar could be shipped to the Athenian naval yard at the Piraeus for storage. Philip V of Macedon seized Zakynthos in the early 3rd century BC when it was a member of the Aetolian League. In 211 BC, the Roman praetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus took the city of Zakynthos with the exception of the citadel. It was afterwards restored to Philip V of Macedon. The Roman general Marcus Fulvius Nobilior finally conquered Zakynthos in 191 BC for Rome. In the Mithridatic War, it was attacked by Archelaus, the general of Mithridates, but he was repulsed. Medieval and modern age After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, it was held by the Kingdom of Naples, the Ottoman Turks, the Republic of Venice, the French, Russians, British, Italians and Germans. World War II During the Nazi occupation of Greece, Mayor Karrer and Bishop Chrysostomos refused Nazi orders to turn in a list of the members of the town's Jewish community for deportation to the death camps. Instead they hid all (or most) of the town's Jewish people in rural villages. According to some sources, all 275 Jews of Zakynthos survived the war. Both were later recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. In contrast, over 80% of Greek Jews were deported to death camps and perished in the Holocaust.History of the Jewish Communities of Greece, American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece , afjmg.org; accessed 7 December 2014. Earthquakes Zakynthos was hit by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake on 12 August 1953, destroying most of the buildings on the island. Subsequently, all buildings have been fortified to protect against further tremors. On 26 October 2018, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake south of the island caused no injuries, but damaged the local pier and a 13th Century monastery. Geography Three-dimensional view of Zakynthos relief Zakynthos lies in the eastern part of the Ionian sea, around west of the Greek (Peloponnese) mainland. The island of Kefalonia lies to the north. It is the southernmost of the main group of the Ionian islands (not counting distant Kythira). Zakynthos is about long and wide, and covers an area of . Its coastline is approximately long. According to the 2011 census, the island has a population of 40,759. The highest point is Vrachionas, at . Zakynthos has the shape of an arrowhead, with the \\"tip\\" (Cape Skinari) pointing northwest. The western half of the island is a mountainous plateau and the southwest coast consists mostly of steep cliffs. The eastern half is a densely populated fertile plain with long sandy beaches, interrupted with several isolated hills, notably Bochali which overlooks the city and the peninsula of Vasilikos in the northeast. The peninsulas of Vassilikos to the north and Marathia to the south enclose the wide and shallow bay of Laganas on the southeast part of the island. The capital, which has the same name as the prefecture, is the town of Zakynthos. It lies on the eastern part of the northern coast. Apart from the official name, it is also called Chora (i.e. the Town, a common denomination in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town). The port of Zakynthos has a ferry connecting to the port of Kyllini on the mainland. Another ferry connects the village of Agios Nikolaos to Argostoli on Kefalonia. Minor uninhabited islands around Zakynthos included in the municipality and regional unit are: Marathonisi, Pelouzo, Agios Sostis in the Laganas bay; Agios Nikolaos, near the eponymous harbor on the northern tip; and Agios Ioannis near Porto Vromi on the western coast. Flora and fauna The mild Mediterranean climate and plentiful winter rainfall endow the island with dense vegetation. The principal agricultural products are olive oil, currants, grapes and citrus fruit. The Zante currant is a small sweet seedless grape that is native to the island. The Bay of Laganas is the site of the first National Marine Park and the prime nesting area for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean. Climate Sights Navagio (shipwreck) bay Famous landmarks include the Navagio beach, a cove on the northwest shore isolated by high cliffs and accessible only by boat. Numerous natural \\"blue caves\\" are cut into cliffs around Cape Skinari, and accessible only by small boats. Keri, on the south of the island, is a mountain village with a lighthouse. The whole western shore from Keri to Skinari contains rock formations including arches. Cliffs and stone arches at Cape Marathia Northern and eastern shores feature numerous wide sandy beaches, some of which attract tourists in summer months. The largest resort is Laganas. Marathonissi islet (also known as \\"Turtle Island\\") near Limni Keriou has tropical vegetation, turquoise waters, beaches, and sea caves. Bochali hill above the Zakynthos town contains a small Venetian castle. Administration Zakynthos is a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region, and the only municipality of the regional unit. The seat of administration is Zakynthos, the main town of the island. Regional unit As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Zakynthos was created out of the former prefecture Zakynthos (). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. In the same reform, the current municipality Zakynthos was created out of the six former municipalities: *Zakynthos (city) *Alykes *Arkadioi *Artemisia *Elatia *Laganas Population and demographics Church and monastery ruins of Panag√≠a Skopi√≥tissa on Mount Skop√≥s *1889: 44,070 (island), 18,906 (city) *1896: 45,032 (island), 17,478 (city) *1900: 42,000 *1907: 42,502 *1920: 37.482 *1940: 42,148 *1981: 30,011 *1991: 32,556 (island), 13,000 (city) *2001: 38,596 *2011: 40,759 In 2006, there were 507 births and 407 deaths. Zakynthos is one of the regions with the highest population growth in Greece. It is also one of the only three prefectures (out of 54) in which the rural population has a positive growth rate. In fact, the rural population's growth rate is higher than that of the urban population in Zakynthos. Out of the 507 births, 141 were in urban areas and 366 were in rural areas. Out of the 407 deaths, 124 were in urban areas and 283 were in rural areas. The population of Zakynthos suffers from an exceptionally high rate of declared blindness of about 1.8%. That rate is about nine times the average in Europe, according to the WHO and in April 2012 the Greek Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity launched an investigation into disability benefits as out of the 650 receiving them at least 600 were falsely declared blind. Culture Nikolaos Koutouzis, self-portrait Literature Faneromeni church, Zakynthos town Since Zakynthos was under the rule of the Venetian Republic, it had closer contact with Western literary trends than other areas inhabited by Greek people. An early literary work from the island is the Rimada, a 16th-century romance in verse about Alexander the Great. Notable early writers include Tzanes Koroneos, author of Andragathemata of Bouas, a work of historical fiction; Nikolaos Loukanis, a 16th-century Renaissance humanist; Markos Defaranas (1503‚Äì1575), possibly the author of the Rimada; Pachomios Roussanos (1508‚Äì1553), a scholar and theologian; and Antonio Catiforo (1685‚Äì1763), a grammarian and satirist. Towards the end of the 18th century, the so-called Heptanese School of Literature developed, consisting mainly of lyrical and satirical poetry in the vein of Romanticism prevalent throughout Europe at the time. It also contributed to the development of modern Greek theatre. An important poet of this school was Zakynthian Dionysios Solomos; another was Nikolaos Koutouzis, who also figures prominently in the Heptanese School of Painting. Others include Georgios Tertsetis (1800‚Äì1873), politician, poet, and historian. Transport Zakynthos Airport The island is covered by a network of roads, particularly the flat eastern part, with main routes linking the capital with Volimes in the north, Keri in the south, and the Vassiliki peninsula in the west. The road between Volimes and Lithakia is the spine of the western half of the island. The island has one airport, Zakynthos International Airport, on former GR-35, offering connecting flights with other Greek airports and numerous tourist charters. Opened in 1972, it is located from Zakynthos. Zakynthos also features two ports, namely the main port, located in the capital, and another in the village of Agios Nikolaos. From the main port there is a connection to the port of Kyllini, which is the usual place of arrival to the island by sea from the mainland. From the port of Agios Nikolaos there is a connection to the island of Kefalonia. Science One academic departments belonging to the Ionio university former to Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands have been located on Zakynthos since 2003. The department of Environment has developed laboratory and field station infrastructures along Zakynthos and the Strofades islets.culture.teiion.gr Technological Educational Institute of Ionian Islands, teiion.gr; accessed 18 June 2015. Freshwater resources on Zakynthos are limited, and as a result a Greek-Norwegian educational collaboration is being established on the island. The Science Park Zakynthos is a collaboration between the Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands (TEI), the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB), and the Therianos Villas and Therianos Family Farm on Zakynthos. Notable people Bust of Pavlos Carrer Among the most famous Zakynthians is the 19th-century poet Dionysios Solomos, whose statue adorns the main town square. The Italian poet Ugo Foscolo was born in Zakynthos. The famous Renaissance surgeon and anatomist Andreas Vesalius died on Zakynthos after being shipwrecked while making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. His body is thought to have been buried on the island but the site has been lost. Early 19th-century poet and playwright Elizabeth Moutzan-Martinegou was also born there. Tourism Since the mid 1980s, Zakynthos (known as Zante) has become a hub for 18-to-30-year-old tourists, leading to Alykanas and Laganas (formerly quiet villages) becoming hometowns of clubbing hotels,https://www.thisiszante.com/zantehotelguide nightclubs, bars and restaurants.

It is traditionally listed as one of the seven main Ionian Islands, although it is distant from the main group. Administratively, it belongs to the Islands regional unit, which is part of the Attica region, despite its distance from the Saronic Islands, around which the rest of Attica is centered. The island is strategically located between the Greek mainland and Crete, and from ancient times until the mid 19th century was a crossroads of merchants, sailors, and conquerors. As such, it has had a long and varied history and has been influenced by many civilisations and cultures. This is reflected in its architecture (a blend of traditional, Aegean and Venetian elements), as well as the traditions and customs, influenced by centuries of coexistence of the Greek, and Venetian cultures. Administration Kythira and the nearby island of Antikythira were separate municipalities until they were merged at the 2011 local government reform; the two islands are now municipal units of Kythira municipality.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The municipality has an area of 300.023 km2, the municipal unit 279.593 km2. The province of Kythira () was one of the provinces of Lakonia, then of Argolis and Korinthia, then of Attica Prefecture from 1929 to 1964. Then from 1964 to 1972 Kythira became part of newly establishment Piraeus Prefecture and after dissolution of Piraeus prefecture returned to Attica Prefecture as part of Piraeus prefecture (ŒùŒøŒºŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±). It was abolished in 2006. From 2011 it is part of the Islands regional unit of Attica region. History Pre-classical and ancient Antikythera mechanism, National Archaeological Museum, Athens There are archaeological remains from the Helladic period, contemporary with the Minoans. There is archaeological evidence of Kythiran trade as far as Egypt and Mesopotamia. Kythira had a Phoenician colony in the early archaic age; the sea-snail which produces Tyrian purple is native to the island.Xenophon refers to a Phoenician Bay in Kythira (Hellenica 4.8.7, probably Avlemonas Bay on the eastern side of the island). The archaic Greek city of Kythira was at Scandea on Avlemonas; its ruins have been excavated. Its acropolis, now Palicastro (Palaeocastron, \\"Old Fort\\"), has the temple of Aphrodite Ourania, who may well represent a Phoenician cult of Astarte. In classical times, Kythira was part of the territory of several larger city-states. Sparta took the island from Argos early in the sixth century, and ruled it under a kytherod√≠kes (kœÖŒ∏Œ∑œÅŒøŒ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ∑œÇ, \\"judge on Kythira\\"), in Thucydides' time [4,53,3]; Athens occupied it three times when at war with Sparta (in 456 during her first war with Sparta and the Peloponnesians; from 426 to 410, through most of the great Peloponnesian War; and from 393 to 387/386, during the Corinthian War against Spartan dominance) and used it both to support her trade and to raid Laconia. Kythira was independent, and issued her own coins in 195 after the Achaean defeat of Sparta. In Augustus' time, it was again subject to Sparta, being the property of Gaius Julius Eurycles, who was both a Spartan magnate and a Roman citizen. By this time, the Greek cities were in practice subject to the Roman Empire. Kythira continued to exist under the Roman Empire and its Byzantine successor state for centuries. Christianity is attested from the fourth century AD, the time of Constantine; according to her legend, Saint Elessa came from Laconia to convert the island.Brill's New Pauly, article on \\"Cythera\\" (for entire section), citing Paus. 1,27,5; Thuc. 4,53,1ff.; 57,4; 5,14,3; 18,7; 7,26,2; 57,6; Xen. Hell. 4,8,7; Isoc. Or. 4,119, and Cassius Dio 54,7,2). Medieval and modern Ruins of Paliochora View of Kythira Castle Katouni bridge (19th century) The castle of Kithira, copper engraving by Coronelli. Kythira is not mentioned in the literary sources for centuries after its conversion; in the period of Byzantine weakness at the end of the seventh century, it might have been exposed to attacks from both the Slavic tribes who raided the mainland and from Arab pirates from the sea. Archaeological evidence suggests the island was abandoned about 700 AD. When Saint Theodore of Cythera led a resettlement after the Byzantine reconquest of Crete in 962, he found the island occupied only by wandering bands of hunters. He established a great monastery at Paliochora; a town grew up around it, largely populated from Laconia. When the Byzantine Empire was divided among the conquerors of the Fourth Crusade, the Republic of Venice took her share, three eighths of the whole, as the Greek islands, Kythira among them. She established a coast patrol on Kythira and Antikythera to protect her trade route to Constantinople; Kythira was one of the islands Venice continued to hold despite the Greek reconquest of Constantinople and the Turkish presence all over the Near East.Fernand Braudel, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II, trans. Reynolds. In the 1995 ed. Vol II, p.877. During the Venetian domination the island was known as Cerigo. Kythirans still talk about the destruction and looting of Paliochora by Barbarossa; it has become an intrinsic part of the Kytherian folklore. One can easily accept the stories of locals by noticing the number of monasteries embedded in the rocky hillsides to avoid destruction by the pirates. Barbary pirates ranged across the Mediterranean waters, raiding ships, coasts and islands, taking booty and slaves for the Barbary slave trade. Kythira was at the mercy of Barbary pirates due to its strategic location in the Mediterrean. In order to intercept merchant vessels, islands along the trade routes were of course more interesting for pirates. In the 17th century the small islands like Sapientza (Kalamatas) south of Messinia (district in south-western part of the Peloponnese), Cergio (Kythira) south of the south-eastern tip of the Peloponnese, and along the coast of Asia minor, the then deserted islands of Fourni southwest of Samos, and the island of Psara, west of Chios, all functioned as pirates nests. When Napoleon put an end to the Venetian Republic in 1797, Kythira was among the islands incorporated in that most distant d√©partment of France, called Mer-√âg√©e. Kythira shared a common destiny with the other Ionian islands during the turbulent Napoleonic era, and is still regarded as one of them; it was counted as one of the Cyclades in antiquity. In 1799, the Ionian islands became the Septinsular Republic, nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but in practice dominated by Russia. In 1807, France took them back only to have the British seize the islands in 1809 and set up one of their first protectorates, the United States of the Ionian Islands. The British held them for nearly half a century; under the British, they were governed by a High Commissioner who could act with both legislative and executive powers. After a long history of turbulence, never settled even by such eminent Commissioners as William Ewart Gladstone for three weeks in the winter of 1859, the British discussion whether they were a waste of money or a vital Imperial possession ended with the cession of the Ionian Islands, including Kythira, to the new King George I of Greece, who was brother-in-law to the Prince of Wales. Under the British, Kythira was known as Carigo or Cerigo, as was its chief town, the name it had under the Venetian Republic. The chief town of the island, Kythira (or Chora, \\"village\\") has the Historical Archives of Kythira, the second largest in the Ionian islands, after Corfu. Geography Satellite image of Kythira Kythira has a land area of ; it is located at the southwestern exit from the Aegean Sea, behind Cape Malea.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Aegean Sea. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC The rugged terrain is a result of prevailing winds from the surrounding seas which have shaped its shores into steep rocky cliffs with deep bays. The island has many beaches, of various composition and size; only half of them can be reached by road through the mountainous terrain of the island. The Kythirian Straits are nearby. Kythira is close to the Hellenic arc plate boundary zone, and thus highly prone to earthquakes. Many earthquakes in recorded history have had their epicentres near or on the island. Probably the largest in recent times is the 1903 earthquake near at the village of Mitata, that caused significant damage as well as limited loss of life. It has had two major earthquakes in the 21st century: that of November 5, 2004, measuring between 5.6 and 5.8 on the Richter scale and the earthquake of January 8, 2006, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale. The epicenter of the latter was in the sea about to the east of Kythira, with a focus at a depth of approximately . Many buildings were damaged, particularly old ones, mostly in the village of Mitata, but with no loss of life. It was felt as far as Italy, Egypt, Malta and Jordan. Climate Kythira has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa) with mild, rainy winters and warm to hot dry summers. Mythology In Ancient Greek mythology, Kythira was considered to be the island of celestial Aphrodite, the Goddess of love (cf. Cyprus, another island devoted to the Goddess of Love). Demographics Like many of the smaller Aegean islands, Kythira's population is decreasing. While the island had reached a peak population of about 14,500 in 1864, that has steadily declined mostly due to emigration, both internal (to major urban centres of Greece) and external (to Australia, the United States, Germany) in the first half of the 20th century. Today its population hovers around 3,354 people (2001 census). Villages of Kythira View of Avlemonas The largest villages (2001 Greek census) are Potam√≥s (pop. 396), Ag√≠a Pelag√≠a (281), Ch√≥ra/K√Ωthira (267), √Åno Liv√°di (175), K√°lamos (157), and Liv√°di (126). * Agia Pelagia Kythira, Port * Agios Ilias * Alexandrades * Ano Livadi * Aroniadika * Avlemonas * Chora, (also Kythira) Kytherian Capital * Christoforianika * Diakofti, Port * Fratsia * Friligianika * Gerakaria * Kalamos * Kapsali * Karavas * Karvounades * Kastrisianika * Keramoto * Kontolianika * Livadi, which is becoming the business center of the island * Katouni * Logothetianika * Louriantianika * Mitata * Mylopotamos * Pitsinianika * Platia Amos * Potamos, largest village * Stathianika * Viaradika * Vouno Economy Fonisa Waterfall at Mylopotamos, Cythera Since the late 20th century, the Kythirean economy has largely focused and, in the process, has become dependent on tourism, which provides the majority of the island's income, despite the fact that Kythira is not one of the most popular tourist destinations in Greece. The popular season usually begins with the Greek holiday of Pentecost at the end of May, and lasts until the middle of September. During this time, primarily during August, the island's population will often triple due to the tourists and natives returning for vacation. Dependence on tourism has resulted in increased building activity in many of the island's villages, mostly for commercial purposes (hotels and hospitality facilities, shops etc.), but also secondary homes; prominent examples are Agia Pelagia and Livadi, both of which having witnessed significant growth in their size since the early 1990s. Minor sources of revenue are thyme honey, famous within Greece for its rich flavor, as well as some small-scale cultivation of vegetables and fruit and animal husbandry that is, nevertheless, increasingly restricted to local consumption. Only five of the island's villages are on the coast (Platia Amos, Agia Pelagia, Diakofti, Avlemonas, & Kapsali). During July and August, several traditional dances will be held in various villages. These dances usually attract the majority of the island's population, the biggest of which are the festival of 'Panagia' in Potamos on 15 August, and the wine festival in Mitata on the first Friday and Saturday of August. Kythira (town) View of the capital, Chora Street of Chora The capital, Chora, is located on the southern part of the island having no ports connected to the southern Peloponnese or Vatika. Kythira's port for Vatika was previously situated at Agia Pelagia, although in recent years this port has been decommissioned and has been replaced by a new port at the coastal town of Diakofti, Kythira. Most of the over 60 village names end with \\"-anika\\" and a few end with -athika, -iana and -ades. This is due to the villages being named after influential families that settled first in that region. For Example, 'Logothetianika' is derived from the Greek last name of 'Logothetis'. Officially, Greek is Kythira's main language. Despite popular belief, most places such as public services and local administrations, will be able to oblige to an individual's needs in English as well. In specific areas, some of Kythira's population is fluent in Italian. Transportation The island in the past has been plagued by a poor infrastructure, exacerbated by the effect of weather on transportation during the winter months. However the construction of the new port in Diakofti along with the renovation of the island's airport have significantly reduced these effects. A new road from the island's most populated town of Potamos in the north to the island's capital of Chora in the south is currently in the planning and development stage. Port Despite the fact that the island has been a trade route for centuries, construction of a modern port was postponed several times until the latter half of the 20th century. In 1933, efforts were made to construct a port in the village of Agia Pelagia, yet financial and governmental problems meant that it was only decades later that one was built. That small port of Agia Pelagia (currently being renovated from a ferry dock to a tourist/recreational boat dock) was the island's main port until the mid-1990s. Around that time the new port of Diakofti, the site originally chosen by the island's British rulers in the 19th century, was constructed along with a modern wider road, aiming to support larger cargo and passenger vessels. The port of Diakofti currently serves scheduled routes to/from Gythion, Kalamata, Antikythera, Piraeus'Athens port, Crete & Neapolis - Vatika. Proposals have been made to attach a Marina to the south side of the port, however no plans or timetables have been produced. Additionally, the harbour of Agia Patrikia (north of Agia Pelagia) is the primary fishing boat harbour, housing two wide boatramps and a boat repair facility. Airport The island's primary airport is the Alexander S. Onassis Airport also known as Kithira Island National Airport, located in the region between the village of Friligiannika and Diakofti, about from the capital. The airport was revamped and extended at the turn of the 21st century, largely by private funds provided by the local population. The island is served by Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines flights.

Its purpose is to analyze radio signals, searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, and as such is one of many activities undertaken as part of the worldwide SETI effort. SETI@home was released to the public on May 17, 1999,https://web.archive.org/web/20000815053637/http://www.nettalklive.com/seti/ making it the third large-scale use of distributed computing over the Internet for research purposes, after Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) was launched in 1996 and distributed.net in 1997. Along with MilkyWay@home and Einstein@home, it is the third major computing project of this type that has the investigation of phenomena in interstellar space as its primary purpose. On March 31 2020, the project stopped sending out new work to SETI@home users, bringing this particular SETI effort to an indefinite hiatus. The SETI team has stated that new ways for the public to contribute to SETI will become available. Scientific research The two original goals of SETI@home were: * to do useful scientific work by supporting an observational analysis to detect intelligent life outside Earth * to prove the viability and practicality of the \\"volunteer computing\\" concept The second of these goals is considered to have succeeded completely. The current BOINC environment, a development of the original SETI@home, is providing support for many computationally intensive projects in a wide range of disciplines. The first of these goals has to date yielded no conclusive results: no evidence for ETI signals has been shown via SETI@home. However, the ongoing continuation is predicated on the assumption that the observational analysis is not \\"ill-posed.\\" The remainder of this article deals specifically with the original SETI@home observations/analysis. The vast majority of the sky (over 98%) has yet to be surveyed, and each point in the sky must be surveyed many times to exclude even a subset of possibilities. Procedure details SETI@home searches for possible evidence of radio transmissions from extraterrestrial intelligence using observational data from the Arecibo radio telescope and the Green Bank Telescope. The data is taken \\"piggyback\\" or \\"passively\\" while the telescope is used for other scientific programs. The data is digitized, stored, and sent to the SETI@home facility. The data are then parsed into small chunks in frequency and time, and analyzed, using software, to search for any signals‚Äîthat is, variations which cannot be ascribed to noise, and hence contain information. Using distributed computing, SETI@home sends the millions of chunks of data to be analyzed off-site by home computers, and then have those computers report the results. Thus what appears a difficult problem in data analysis is reduced to a reasonable one by aid from a large, Internet-based community of borrowed computer resources. The software searches for five types of signals that distinguish them from noise: * Spikes in power spectra * Gaussian rises and falls in transmission power, possibly representing the telescope beam's main lobe passing over a radio source * Triplets ‚Äì three power spikes in a row * Pulsing signals that possibly represent a narrowband digital-style transmission * Autocorrelation detects signal waveforms. There are many variations on how an ETI signal may be affected by the interstellar medium, and by the relative motion of its origin compared to Earth. The potential \\"signal\\" is thus processed in many ways (although not testing all detection methods nor scenarios) to ensure the highest likelihood of distinguishing it from the scintillating noise already present in all directions of outer space. For instance, another planet is very likely to be moving at a speed and acceleration with respect to Earth, and that will shift the frequency, over time, of the potential \\"signal.\\" Checking for this through processing is done, to an extent, in the SETI@home software. The process is somewhat like tuning a radio to various channels, and looking at the signal strength meter. If the strength of the signal goes up, that gets attention. More technically, it involves a lot of digital signal processing, mostly discrete Fourier transforms at various chirp rates and durations. Results To date, the project has not confirmed the detection of any ETI signals. However, it has identified several candidate targets (sky positions), where the spike in intensity is not easily explained as noisespots, for further analysis. The most significant candidate signal to date was announced on September 1, 2004, named Radio source SHGb02+14a. While the project has not reached the stated primary goal of finding extraterrestrial intelligence, it has proved to the scientific community that distributed computing projects using Internet- connected computers can succeed as a viable analysis tool, and even beat the largest supercomputers. However, it has not been demonstrated that the order of magnitude excess in computers used, many outside the home (the original intent was to use 50,000‚Äì100,000 \\"home\\" computers), has benefited the project scientifically. (For more on this, see below.) Astronomer Seth Shostak stated in 2004 that he expects to get a conclusive signal and proof of alien contact between 2020 and 2025, based on the Drake equation. This implies that a prolonged effort may benefit SETI@home, despite its (present) twenty-year run without success in ETI detection. Technology Anybody with an at least intermittently Internet-connected computer can participate in SETI@home by running a free program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data. Observational data are recorded on 2-terabyte SATA hard disk drives at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, each holding about 2.5 days of observations, which are then sent to Berkeley. Arecibo does not have a broadband Internet connection, so data must go by postal mail to Berkeley. Once there, it is divided in both time and frequency domains work units of 107 seconds of data, or approximately 0.35 megabytes (350 kilobytes or 350,000 bytes), which overlap in time but not in frequency. These work units are then sent from the SETI@home server over the Internet to personal computers around the world to analyze. The analysis software can search for signals with about one-tenth the strength of those sought in previous surveys, because it makes use of a computationally-intensive algorithm called coherent integration that no one else has had the computing power to implement. Data is merged into a database using SETI@home computers in Berkeley. Interference is rejected, and various pattern-detection algorithms are applied to search for the most interesting signals. The project uses CUDA for GPU processing since 2015.https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/apps.php Since 2016, the project has also been helping to process data from the Breakthrough Listen project which has been recorded at Green Bank Telescope. Software The BOINC Manager working on the SETI@home project (v 7.6.22) Screenshot of SETI@home Enhanced BOINC Screensaver (v6.03) Screenshot of SETI@home Classic Screensaver (v3.07) The SETI@home distributed computing software runs either as a screensaver or continuously while a user works, making use of processor time that would otherwise be unused. The initial software platform, now referred to as \\"SETI@home Classic,\\" ran from May 17, 1999, to December 15, 2005. This program was only capable of running SETI@home; it was replaced by Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), which also allows users to contribute to other distributed computing projects at the same time as running SETI@home. The BOINC platform will also allow testing for more types of signals. The discontinuation of the SETI@home Classic platform has rendered older Macintosh computers running the classic Mac OS unsuitable for participating in the project. SETI@home is available for the Sony PlayStation 3 console. On May 3, 2006, new work units for a new version of SETI@home called \\"SETI@home Enhanced\\" started distribution. Since computers now have the power for more computationally intensive work than when the project began, this new version is more sensitive by a factor of two concerning Gaussian signals and to some kinds of pulsed signals than the original SETI@home (BOINC) software. This new application has been optimized to the point where it will run faster on some work units than earlier versions. However, some work units (the best work units, scientifically speaking) will take significantly longer. In addition, some distributions of the SETI@home applications have been optimized for a particular type of CPU. They are referred to as \\"optimized executables\\" and have been found to run faster on systems specific for that CPU. , most of these applications were optimized for Intel processors and their corresponding instruction sets. The results of the data processing are normally automatically transmitted when the computer is next connected to the Internet; it can also be instructed to connect to the Internet as needed. Statistics With over 5.2 million participants worldwide, the project is the distributed computing project with the most participants to date. The original intent of SETI@home was to utilize 50,000‚Äì100,000 home computers. Since its launch on May 17, 1999, the project has logged over two million years of aggregate computing time. On September 26, 2001, SETI@home had performed a total of 1021 floating point operations. It was acknowledged by the 2008 edition of the Guinness World Records as the largest computation in history. With over 145,000 active computers in the system (1.4 million total) in 233 countries, , SETI@home had the ability to compute over 668 teraFLOPS. For comparison, the Tianhe-2 computer, which was the world's fastest supercomputer, was able to compute 33.86 petaFLOPS (approximately 50 times greater). Project future There were plans to get data from the Parkes Observatory in Australia to analyze the southern hemisphere. However, , these plans were not mentioned in the project's website. Other plans include a Multi-Beam Data Recorder, a Near Time Persistency Checker and Astropulse (an application that uses coherent dedispersion to search for pulsed signals). Astropulse will team with the original SETI@home to detect other sources, such as rapidly rotating pulsars, exploding primordial black holes, or as-yet unknown astrophysical phenomena. Beta testing of the final public release version of Astropulse was completed in July 2008, and the distribution of work units to higher spec machines capable of processing the more CPU intensive work units started in mid-July 2008. UC Berkeley announced that it will stop sending out new data for SETI@Home clients to process after March 31, 2020, ending the effort for the time being. The program stated they were at a point of \\"diminishing returns\\" with the distributed processing and needed to put the effort into hibernation while they processed the results. Competitive aspect SETI@home users quickly started to compete with one another to process the maximum number of work units. Teams were formed to combine the efforts of individual users. The competition continued and grew larger with the introduction of BOINC. As with any competition, attempts have been made to \\"cheat\\" the system and claim credit for work that has not been performed. To combat cheats, the SETI@home system sends every work unit to multiple computers, a value known as \\"initial replication\\" (currently 2). Credit is only granted for each returned work unit once a minimum number of results have been returned and the results agree, a value known as \\"minimum quorum\\" (currently 2). If, due to computation errors or cheating by submitting false data, not enough results agree, more identical work units are sent out until the minimum quorum can be reached. The final credit granted to all machines which returned the correct result is the same and is the lowest of the values claimed by each machine. Some users have installed and run SETI@home on computers at their workplaces ‚Äì an act known as \\"Borging\\", after the assimilation-driven Borg of Star Trek. In some cases, SETI@home users have misused company resources to gain work-unit results ‚Äì with at least two individuals getting fired for running SETI@home on an enterprise production system. There is a thread in the newsgroup alt.sci.seti which bears the title \\"Anyone fired for SETI screensaver\\" and ran starting as early as September 14, 1999. Other users collect large quantities of equipment together at home to create \\"SETI farms\\", which typically consist of a number of computers consisting of only a motherboard, CPU, RAM and power supply that are arranged on shelves as diskless workstations running either Linux or old versions of Microsoft Windows \\"headless\\" (without a monitor). Challenges to the project There are other challenges to the project's future viability. As in any project of prolonged duration, various factors may result in its termination. Some of these are detailed below: Potential closure of Arecibo Observatory At present, SETI@home procures its data from the Arecibo Observatory facility operated by the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and administered by SRI International. The decreasing operating budget for the observatory has created a shortfall of funds which has not been made up from other sources such as private donors, NASA, other foreign research institutions, nor private non-profit organizations such as SETI@home. However, in the overall longterm views held by many involved with the SETI project, any usable radio telescope could take over from Arecibo, as all the SETI systems are portable and relocatable. Alternative distributed computing projects When the project launched, there were few alternative ways of donating computer time to research projects. However, there are now many other projects that are competing for such time. More restrictive computer use policies in businesses In one documented case, an individual was fired for explicitly importing and using the SETI@home software on computers used for the U.S. state of Ohio. In another incident a school IT director resigned after his installation allegedly cost his school district $1 million in removal costs; however, other reasons for this firing included lack of communication with his superiors, not installing firewall software and alleged theft of computer equipment, leading a ZDNet editor to comment that \\"the distributed computing nonsense was simply the best and most obvious excuse the district had to terminate his contract with cause\\". , approximately one-third of the processing for the non-BOINC version of the software was performed on work or school based machines. As many of these computers will give reduced privileges to ordinary users, it is possible that much of this has been done by network administrators. To some extent, this may be offset by better connectivity to home machines and increasing performance of home computers, especially those with GPUs, which have also benefited other distributed computing projects such as Folding@Home. The spread of mobile computing devices provides another large resource for distributed computing. For example, in 2012, Piotr Luszczek (a former doctoral student of Jack Dongarra), presented results showing that an iPad 2 matched the historical performance of a Cray-2 (the fastest computer in the world in 1985) on an embedded LINPACK benchmark. Funding There is currently no government funding for SETI research, and private funding is always limited. Berkeley Space Science Lab has found ways of working with small budgets, and the project has received donations allowing it to go well beyond its original planned duration, but it still has to compete for limited funds with other SETI projects and other space sciences projects. In a December 16, 2007 plea for donations, SETI@home stated its present modest state and urged donations of $476,000 needed for continuation into 2008. Unofficial clients A number of individuals and companies made unofficial changes to the distributed part of the software to try to produce faster results, but this compromised the integrity of all the results. As a result, the software had to be updated to make it easier to detect such changes, and discover unreliable clients. BOINC will run on unofficial clients; however, clients that return different and therefore incorrect data are not allowed, so corrupting the result database is avoided. BOINC relies on cross-checking to validate data but unreliable clients need to be identified, to avoid situations when two of these report the same invalid data and therefore corrupt the database. A very popular unofficial client (lunatic) allows users to take advantage of the special features provided by their processor(s) such as SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, and AVX to allow for faster processing. Hardware and database failures SETI@home is a test bed for further development not only of BOINC but of other hardware and software (database) technology. Under SETI@home processing loads, these experimental technologies can be more challenging than expected, as SETI databases do not have typical accounting and business data or relational structures. The non-traditional database uses often do incur greater processing overheads and risk of database corruption and outright database failure. Hardware, software and database failures can (and do) cause dips in project participation. The project has had to shut down several times to change over to new databases capable of handling more massive datasets. Hardware failure has proven to be a substantial source of project shutdowns, as hardware failure is often coupled with database corruption.
