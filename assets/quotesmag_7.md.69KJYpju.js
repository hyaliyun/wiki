The application has a customizable feed which displays relevant and personalized information for the user, such as a news feed, to-do lists, calendar events, recent activity, and more. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen reveals application shortcuts, and the application tray includes a search bar and recently installed apps at the top. Design elements are highly personalizable with a wide range of options, such as having the Bing daily wallpaper as a background image on the lock screen and/or home screen. The launcher integrates with Microsoft's other Android applications by enabling features such as \\"Continue on PC\\", which allows a user to work seamlessly between their phone and a Windows PC. For example, they are able to open a web page in Edge and then open exactly the same page on their PC, not unlike Apple's Handoff feature.

The highest summit is over . The mountains are geologically related to the Ochoco Mountains and are named after members of Joseph Powell's family.  Geology  The Powell Buttes are five rhyolitic buttes in western Crook County in Central Oregon. One of the buttes is considerably larger than the rest. Hat Rock is one of the named summits. In addition to the rhyolite, tuff and diatomite also comprise the buttes. Welded tuff has been found, showing it once comprised the Crooked River caldera. The buttes are morphologically related to the Ochoco Mountains. Low grade uranium was found in very small amounts along the western side of one of the smaller buttes.  Environment and ecology  In the summer, the environment around the Powell Buttes is dry and warm during the day and cool at night. In the winter, the weather is cold with snow occurring from October through April. Western juniper is the dominate tree species on the mountain. Big sagebrush, gray rabbitbrush, and antelope bitterbrush are the predominant understory vegetation. Low ground cover includes arrowleaf balsamroot, spiny phlox, common yarrow, longleaf hawksbeard, ragged robin, bitterroot, and nineleaf biscuitroot. Native grass species include wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, and giant-heads clover.Kriegh, LeeAnn, The Nature of Bend, Tempo Press, Bend, Oregon, 2016, pp. 106, 115, 116, 117. Numerous bird species are found on the Powell Buttes. California quail and mountain quail live on the mountain slopes. Other small bird species include black-capped chickadees, mountain chickadee, pine siskins, lesser goldfinches, American goldfinches, canyon wrens, rock wrens, cliff swallows, barn swallows, western meadowlark, mountain bluebirds, sage thrashers, American robins, mourning doves, and Brewers blackbirds. Larger birds include western scrub-jays, Steller’s jays, pinyon jays, Northern flickers, black-billed magpies, and American crows. Birds of prey found on or near Powell Buttes include American kestrel, Cooper’s hawk, northern goshawk, northern harrier, peregrine falcon, prairie falcon, red-tailed hawk, golden eagle, and bald eagle. Burrowing owls, barn owls, great horned owl, and turkey vultures are also common in the area around the mountain.Kriegh, LeeAnn, The Nature of Bend, Tempo Press, Bend, Oregon, 2016, pp. 151, 188. Small mammals found on the Powell Buttes include American badger, striped skunks, western spotted skunks, common raccoons, black-tailed jackrabbits, mountain cottontails, California ground squirrels, Belding's ground squirrels, Ord's kangaroo rat, and deer mice. Larger mammals include black-tailed deer, coyotes, bobcats, and mountain lions. Reptiles found on Powell Buttes include common garter snakes, gopher snakes, and western rattlesnakes. Common lizards include short-horned lizards, western fence lizards, sagebrush lizards, and western skinks.Kriegh, LeeAnn, The Nature of Bend, Tempo Press, Bend, Oregon, 2016, p. 269.

McArthur, \\"Powell Buttes\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 781. In 1989, the Bureau of Land Management established a Research Natural Area along the south side of the mountain including the southwest and southeast slopes. The area's status was confirmed by a second study in 2005. A large destination resort by Pahlisch Homes, called the Hidden Canyon, was planned for development on the buttes but never saw completion because of land impact issues related to wildlife, among other reasons. From 1986 to 2018, Powell Butte was the site of one of two facilities of Oregon State University's Central Oregon Agricultural Research Center. The Powell Butte agricultural research farm acted as a center for potato variety development and hay production. The site encompassed , most of which were dedicated to potato seed development. In 2010, an outbreak of the potato cyst nematode Globodera ellingtonae caused the farm to shut down, with major research activity moving to a different site in the city of Klamath Falls. In June 2018, the land was sold to an industrial hemp producer.

It has a single thin, tube-shaped leaf and up to ten greenish and whitish flowers with reddish or purplish stripes. It differs from other leek orchids in having a very thin leaf and prominently streaked flowers. Description Prasophyllum striatum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf long and about in diameter. The free part of the leaf is long. Up to ten flowers are arranged on a flowering spike high. The flowers are long and wide on a short, thin ovary, and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is triangular, greenish with reddish or purplish stripes and is long and about wide. The lateral sepals are a similar size and colour to the dorsal sepal, fused to each other and curve backwards. The petals are whitish with reddish or purplish stripes and are about long and wide. The labellum is white, about long and wide. It curves gently upwards and has wavy edges. There is a raised, creamy-white callus with two parallel ridges in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from March to June. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum striatum was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (striatum) is a Latin word meaning \\"furrowed\\", \\"channelled\\" or \\"striped\\". In 2004 David Jones and Mark Clements proposed changing the name to Mecopodum striatum but the name has not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Distribution and habitat The striated leek orchid grows in shallow soil on sandstone and near swamps mainly near the coast from Bulahdelah to Nowra but also in the Blue Mountains.

It is contested by teams at level 7 of the English rugby union system. While the competition is a national one, it is however split into regions until the semi-finals with the final being held at Twickenham Stadium in London. It was first contested in 1997. Presently, the RFU Intermediate Cup is the third most important club cup competition in England, behind the Premiership Rugby Cup and RFU Championship Cup.  History  The RFU Intermediate Cup was first contested in 1997 for clubs at Level 7 of English rugby. The competition was initially unsponsored but later gained sponsorship from NPI, Powergen and EDF Energy before becoming known as the \\"RFU Intermediate Cup\\" solely un-sponsored by 2008. The largest crowd for a final was set in 2016 for the match between Kent based Tunbridge Wells RFC and Cumbria's St. Benedict's where 9,000 Tunbridge Wells fans attended the final. A number of future RFU Championship clubs have played in the RFU Intermediate Cup prior to promotion to the second tier with Jersey Reds, Hartpury College, Doncaster Knights and Richmond all taking part in the past. Current format The rounds are contested on a regional basis between the four regional unions until the semi-finals, where the winner of each region enters the national competition. Each region decides their representative separately. For example, London and South East use a direct knockout competition of all teams in the region while South West split their region into Southern Counties and South Western Counties with the winners playing each other to be the region's representative. Each regional champion plays another set champion with the ground being one of the semi-finalist's home. The semi-finals pairings are London & South East against South West and Midlands against North. The winners of the semis play each other in the final at Twickenham Stadium. North The format for northern teams involved in the RFU Intermediate Cup is a league-cup hybrid with each county union in the region selecting one representative each. The first stage features a mini league with clubs from Cheshire, Cumbria and Lancashire meeting in one pool and clubs from Durham County, Northumberland and Yorkshire, meeting in the other, each side playing 2 games each. The winners of each group then meet in the north final to determine who goes forward to the national semi-finals. The competition involves representative teams from the following level 7 leagues: *Cumbria 1 *Durham/Northumberland 1 *Lancs/Cheshire 1 *Yorkshire 1 Midlands The format for Midlands teams involved in the RFU Senior Vase is a direct knockout cup with a 1st round, 2nd round, 3rd round, semi-finals and final. The winner of the final goes forward to the Senior Vase national semi-finals. The competition involves all teams from the following level 7 leagues: *Midlands 2 West (North) *Midlands 2 West (South) *Midlands 2 East (North) *Midlands 2 East (South) London and South East As with the Midlands the format for London and South East teams involved in the RFU Senior Vase is a direct knockout cup with a 1st round, 2nd round, 3rd round, semi-finals and final. The winner of the final goes forward to the Senior Vase national semi-finals. The competition involves all teams from the following level 7 leagues: *London 2 North East *London 2 North West *London 2 South East *London 2 South West South West The format for the south-west teams is more complex with different methods of qualification decided on by the county unions that they represent. Clubs that are affiliated with Dorset & Wilts and Gloucestershire play in county based knock-out competitions first. The winners of the Dorset & Wilts competition then plays in the Southern Counties semi-finals against representatives from Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, while the Gloucestershire winners play in the South West Counties semi-finals against representative from Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, with the winners then meeting in a regional final. Finally, the Southern Counties and South West Counties winners meet to determine qualification for the national semi-finals.

Kennedy International Airport on February 28, 1984. The flight, operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, originated at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, Sweden, before a stopover at Oslo Airport, Fornebu. All 177 passengers and crew members on board survived, although 12 were injured. The cause was a runway overshoot due to the crew's failure to monitor their airspeed and overreliance on the aircraft's autothrottle. Aircraft LN-RKB in a previous livery, 1983 Flight 901 was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, registered as LN-RKB, named the Haakon Viking, and first flown in testing in 1975. Its McDonnell Douglas construction number was 46871/219. The aircraft was equipped with three General Electric CF6-50C engines. It entered into commercial flight service with Scandinavian Airlines in January 1976. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident. Investigators first thought a probable cause of the crash could be hydroplaning since there was bad weather on arrival, but this was later ruled out when investigators inspected the runway and found that the grooves on the runway were in good condition and there were no recent reports of hydroplaning on that runway. The NTSB discovered from eyewitnesses that the airport's control tower could not see the flight arriving due to low visibility. However, they and passengers on the flight reported that the aircraft traveled an unusually long distance before landing. According to the flight's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, the aircraft was at an unusually high speed of 205 knots before landing. It was also noticed that the captain only monitored his airspeed, not the shown ground speed. To avoid striking the approach lighting system, they veered the DC-10 off Runway 04R using the aircraft's rudder. The aircraft came to a rest in shallow water from Runway 04R. Investigators discovered that the captain was relying on the aircraft's autothrottle, believing that it would automatically decrease turbine power. NTSB investigators also found that the autothrottle control system had malfunctioned during previous flights. They believe that during the approach, the DC-10's autothrottle had a software malfunction, leading to increased airspeed before touching down. In the NTSB's final report, the probable cause of SAS Flight 901 states that \\"The flightcrew’s (a) disregard for prescribed procedures for monitoring and controlling of airspeed during the final stages of the approach and (b) decision to continue the landing rather than to execute a missed approach, and (c) overreliance on the autothrottle speed control system which had a history of recent malfunctions\\". Aftermath LN-RKB, December 1984, after it was repaired. Incident aircraft as N311FE, May 2010. The NTSB had issued two safety recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration on November 16, 1984, one day after releasing the final report. After the accident, mechanics found that LN-RKB suffered substantial damage, but was later repaired and returned to service, until it was bought by Federal Express in 1985, reregistered as N311FE, and converted into a freighter. It was withdrawn from use and stored in 2012; in 2013 it was returned to service. As of September 2020, the aircraft is currently in cargo service with FedEx Express.

On January 31, 2017, Amazon announced that Amazon Air would make Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (KCVG) its principal hub, which began operations on April 30, 2017. Amazon received $40 million in tax incentives and plans to begin construction on a facility with a sorting facility and parking space for over 100 cargo aircraft; the project is estimated to cost $1.5 billion. In December 2017 the company, which was named Amazon Prime Air, announced its rebranding as Amazon Air to avoid confusion with the Amazon Prime Air drone delivery service. As of June 2018, Amazon Air had 20 of its 33 cargo planes based at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (KCVG), with the rest flying point-to-point transit routes across the United States. Amazon Air was to move into office space at the former Comair headquarters by March 2018. Amazon leased 10 additional Boeing 767-300 planes from ATSG in December 2018. Amazon's utilization is 6–7 hours per day, less than half of FedEx Express or UPS Airlines' 767s. From their respective hub, Amazon reaches fewer than 30 markets, some less than daily, while FedEx's network touched 130 markets multiple times per day, with little overlap in capacity, frequency or markets served. Amazon has completed a new regional air hub at Fort Worth Alliance Airport (KAFW) and does not airlift third-party packages. The new regional hub began operating on October 2, 2019. For 2019 and 2020, Amazon has committed to leasing 10 additional 767-300 aircraft from Air Transport Services Group. This would bring active aircraft to a total of 50. Phase one of the CVG sort facility, encompassing is scheduled for completion in 2020, while the remaining will be developed by 2025–2027 during phase two. Amazon eventually plans to have over 100 aircraft based at CVG with over 200 daily flights and 15,000 employees. In July, 2020, Amazon Air has secured up to six million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supplied by Shell Aviation and produced by World Energy. In September, 2020 Amazon committed to buy four aircraft under their own operations , these are the first four aircraft the company will own rather than lease.

Life and education  Asad Raza was born in 1974 in Buffalo, New York to Pakistani immigrant parents, and studied literature at Johns Hopkins University from 1992-1996 and filmmaking at the Tisch School of Arts in 1993. He also studied literature at NYU, where he helped organize the 2005 graduate student strike. From 2005-2010, Raza wrote frequently about tennis for various magazines and newspapers.  Work  Asad Raza's practices encompasses artistic projects, collaborations, curatorial work and his work, and he is described as \\"one of the most interesting crossroads figures in our sometimes rigid panorama.\\" Raza’s works often respond to a particular environment in a site-specific manner. For example, in Root sequence. Mother tongue, created for the 2017 Whitney Biennial, trees in boxes were brought into the museum. Another example of this is his piece Untitled (plot for dialogue). Here, Raza installed a tennis court inside the 16th century church of San Paolo Converso in Milan.  Selected projects  Absorption  In 2019 Raza created the 34th Kaldor Public Art Project in Sydney, Australia. His work, entitled Absorption, entailed the creation of 300 tonnes of \\"neo-soil\\" made from waste products and other materials found in Sydney. This filled an entire building at the Carriageworks art institution, and was given away to visitors. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the work \\"dramatises the differences between art and science, but it also shows us what they have in common...Artists, like scientists, are constantly pushing back the frontiers of the thinkable. By creating a work from soil, Raza is making a clear statement of ecological intent.\\" Untitled (plot for dialogue)  Asked to create a show for CONVERSO, Raza \\"installed a clay tennis court in a desacralised 16th-century church in Milan\\" complete with flooring, lines, netting, racquets, iced jasmine tea, scent and coaches for a tennis-like game. The piece was described as \\"plac[ing] the experience of play above the purely visual appreciation, as the back-and-forth of tennis exchanges produces meditative beauty through actions never to be repeated.\\"  Root sequence. Mother tongue  Created for the 2017 Whitney Biennial, Root sequence. Mother tongue was an composed of \\"26 young, often flowering trees facing the flickering light of the city\\", human caretakers, and objects belonging to the caretakers, as well as a scent created by Raza’s sister, the perfumer and artist Alia Raza. The piece ran for 4 months, and included a curatorial element, the Weekend Guests series, in which Raza invited choreographers, musicians, poets and scholars to conduct events inside the installation, including Manthia Diawara, Moriah Evans, Dan Graham, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Andros Zins-Browne,https://whitney.org/Events/AndrosZinsBrowneMay7am and others. The piece was shown for a second time at the Rockbund Museum, Shanghai, in September–October 2017.  home show  The Home Show was a hybrid artistic and curatorial exhibition held in Raza’s own apartment. For the show, he asked thirty artists he knew to contribute objects, instructions, rituals: Carsten Höller contributed \\"a dream-activating toothpaste\\" and Rachel Rose edited all of his possessions. Raza also included items from family members and his life. Raza gave a tour to each visitor for the show’s five weeks, executing the instructions and rituals each day.  Schema for a school  Schema for a school takes the form of \\"an experimental school\\" that considered new models for teaching and learning, through a series of relevant thoughts and actions drawn from sociology, philosophy, cooking, choreography, literature, and other forms of awareness. Raza was influenced by Dan Graham’s Schema (1966), a work that describes its own attributes according to strict rules every time it is reproduced. Schema is an adaptive protocol, a responsive script, and its form is a model for the pedagogical schemata the school will use. The school first took place in Ljubljana, Slovenia in 2015, with further iterations at the Villa Empain in Brussels and Palais de Tokyo in Paris in 2016, and it is next scheduled for New York’s The Shed in 2018.  There is no east or west  Raza’s project animated the streetlights running up a hillside promenade in Ljublana’s, playing a visual song visible from many parts of the city. Coming on with the streetlights at dusk and running until dawn, the piece lasted the duration of the 2015 Graphic Art Biennial, turning the cityscape into an animated graphic artwork. Raza says he was influences by blinking lights visible across the Bosphorus in Istanbul.  Minor History  Minor History is a portrait in film of Wahid Mohammed, Asad Raza’s 90 year-old uncle who lives in Buffalo, New York. The film premiered on January 27th 2019 at International Film Festival Rotterdam.  Collaborations   Home Cooking  In March 2020, Raza began a collaborative project known as Home Cooking, a digital artist-run space with collaborators Marianna Simnett, Dora Budor, Prem Krishnamurthy, Precious Okoyomon. Presenting works, conversations and interviews, Home Cooking was a way of presenting new work within a coronavirus reality.  Villa Empain  From 2016-2017, Raza served as the artistic director for the Villa Empain, Brussels. There he co-curated the shows Mondialité with Hans Ulrich Obrist, Décor with Dorothea von Hantelmann and Tino Sehgal, Répétition with Nicola Lees, and Seeing Zen with Felix Hess and John Stevens.  Solaris Chronicles  For this show, curated by Liam Gillick, Hans Ulrich Obrist, and Philippe Parreno, Raza collaborated with Parreno and Sehgal to create a dramaturgical presentation of the architectural models of Frank Gehry, which were placed on wheeled tables and moved in a choreographic ballet.  A stroll through a fun palace  For this show curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Raza and Sehgal created a dramaturgical presentation of the archives of Lucius Burkhardt and Cedric Price.  Collaborations as producer/dramaturge  From 2010-2015, Raza collaborated frequently with Tino Sehgal, serving as the producer for Sehgal’s major exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. His closest collaborations with Sehgal came in 2011-12, with the works Ann Lee first shown at the Manchester International and These associations, which Raza and Sehgal developed in London and Manchester over two years. According to the Guardian, \\"[s]everal hundred participants\\" were involved in the project at the Tate, \\"recruited through networks of friends and acquaintances, and rehearsed by Sehgal and his producer, Asad Raza.\\" In 2014, Raza produced and directed These associations at CCBB, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. In 2014 Raza also realized a long-term project of bring Sehgal’s works to the ancient center of Athens, Greece, with the NEON foundation, stating \\"When I visited the ancient sites of Athens, where commercial, cultural, social and philosophical exchange took place, where knowledge passed through and was transferred between bodies, I had the distinct feeling that the embodied and dialogical elements in Sehgal’s work would have a special resonance here.” Raza served as a dramaturge for several exhibitions with Philippe Parreno, including Park Avenue Armory, Rockbund Museum, and Jumex Museum.  Mayfield Depot  For the 2013 Manchester International Festival, Alex Poots, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Raza, and Sehgal programmed this exhibition in the disused Manchester train depot, which was a museum of dance and live art projects.  Books  Raza has made several books, including Home Show, Mondialité, Décor, Seeing Zen, and Répétition. He has also written about tennis for magazines and newspapers including the New Yorker, n+1, the New York Times, and Tennis magazine.

He was director-general of the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) between 1984 and 1986. As a microbiologist Cohen worked on development of polio vaccines in the Netherlands. Career Cohen was born in Groningen on 3 February 1923. He was born to a non-religious Jewish father and Protestant mother. His father assumed his mother's faith. His uncle on father's side was David Cohen. During his childhood Cohen wished to become a pediatrician. After attending the gymnasium he enrolled at the University of Groningen to study medicine. Due to his Jewish sounding surname he was expelled in 1941. Cohen, being only half Jewish, evaded further measures and worked as a medical analist for the next several years. Directly after the end of World War II he resumed his studies, obtaining his title of doctorandus in 1950. In 1953 he obtained his PhD. In 1953 he started working for the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid, a predecessor of the RIVM. His initial wish was to start working on a polio vaccine but he was rebuffed as there was not yet a government vaccination order. However, during the 1950s and 1960s he worked on the development of the Salk polio vaccine. In the 1970s Cohen together with Jonas Salk and Charles Mérieux founded the Forum for the Advancement of Immunization Research (FAIR). He was pivotal in the introduction of the DPT vaccine in the Netherlands. At the onset of the discovery of HIV/AIDS Cohen noticed abnormalities in the blood values and stopped the import of blood to the Netherlands. During his time as director- general of the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid he oversaw the merger with two other institutes per 1984, which resulted in the formation of the RIVM. Per 1 January 1984 he was appointed director-general of the RIVM. His term ended in 1986. The Dutch Council of Ministers subsequently nominated him as head of the . He held this position for ten years. In 1992, after a minor polio outbreak in the Netherlands, he protested against the offer of a free polio vaccine to around nine million persons not in risk groups, calling it a \\"waste of money\\". Cohen was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980. In 1986 he was named Commander in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Cohen died of the consequences of COVID-19 on 14 May 2020 in Bosch en Duin, aged 97. He had suffered from dementia for the last three years of his life.

Particular emphasis has been placed on achieving exceptionally low internal friction, which is described as being 17% less than 2.2-L diesel predecessor. \\"Other details include roller bearings on cam and balancer shafts instead of machined-in bearing surfaces, computer-controlled variable oil and water pumps, a split circuit cooling system enabling fast warm ups, a simplified cam drive system, crankshafts that are offset from the centre of the block and electronically controlled piston cooling jets to improve efficiency in the oil pumping circuit.\\" In 2017 Jaguar Land Rover licensed the Multiair/UniAir electrohydraulic variable valve lift systemJLR taps Schaeffler's fuel-saving system, sources say: JLR taps Schaeffler's fuel-saving system, sources say, accessdate: 14. helmikuuta 2018 from Schaeffler Group, which Schaeffler in turn licensed from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2001. The system, developed by Fiat Powertrain Technologies, is a hydraulically-actuated variable valve timing (VVT) technology enabling \\"cylinder by cylinder, stroke by stroke\\" control of intake air directly via a gasoline engine's inlet valves. In February 2019, Jaguar Land Rover announced their long-rumoured inline-6 engine. Instead of being a conventional engine, the new 3.0L petrol inline-6 motor combines with a 48 volt electric architecture to enable an electric supercharger, belt-starter generator and extended engine shut offs while coasting and/or while stopped in traffic. The new engine is initially being offered in the Range Rover Sport in two power outputs, and . Both are considered to be mild hybrid electric vehicles. The 48 volt electrical architecture JLR announced with this new engine is similar to Mercedes-Benz's \\"EQ Boost\\" and Audi's 48V systems available in 2019.

The Rally of Poland was removed from the calendar after the event was taken off the World Championship schedule, while the Rallies of Deutschland and Rally Catalunya were also removed from the schedule and replaced by the Rally of Turkey. The changes were made to create a more compact championship with an earlier end date whilst giving drivers experience on a wider range of surface types.

History The building was designed as the headquarters of the Surrey Yeomanry and was completed in the early 20th century. The regiment was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to Salonika. The regiment evolved to become the 98th (Surrey and Sussex Yeomanry, Queen Mary's) Army Field Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1922, 298 Field Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1947 and 263 (Surrey Yeomanry, Queen's Mary's) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1961. The unit was disbanded in 1967 but was reformed as B (Surrey Yeomanry) Troop, 200 (Sussex Yeomanry) Field Battery, 100 Medium Regiment RA (Volunteers) when it moved to Sutton in 1969. Instead the drill hall became the base for a detachment from 210 Ambulance Squadron, 151 (Greater London) Transport Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport. The detachment was subsequently transferred to 240 Transport Squadron, 151 Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps. After the drill hall had been decommissioned, it was used as a filming venue. The drill hall was demolished in April 2020 to make way for Harris Clapham Sixth Form College which is due to open in September 2021.

Biography Nixon, a right-handed player, comes from the city of Coronado, near San Diego. An All-American player at UC Berkeley, he won the Pac-10 Championship in his senior year (1983). He graduated with a political science degree. Turning professional in 1983, Nixon spent three years on the professional circuit. In late 1984 he toured Australia and in his first outing in Brisbane and partnering Glenn Layendecker came close to upsetting the top seeded doubles team of Mark Edmondson and Peter Fleming, managing to take the match to a deciding tiebreak. Soon after he and Laydendecker made the doubles semi-finals at the Melbourne Indoor Grand Prix tournament and then competed together in the main draw of the Australian Open men's doubles. He also featured in the men's singles draw and was beaten in the first round by fellow qualifier Matt Anger in four sets. Following the Australian Open he competed at the Melbourne Outdoor and upset world number 32 John Lloyd, before exiting in the second round. He partnered with Scott McCain to make the doubles quarter-finals at the 1985 Tokyo Outdoor Grand Prix event and in the same year was runner-up in the singles at the Montreal Challenger. His only Challenger title came in doubles, at Berkeley in 1986, with Peter Wright. He featured in the main draw of the 1986 US Open paired with Brett Dickinson, as lucky losers from the qualifying draw. The 1986 season was his final year on the professional tour.

The event for women was held from 18 to 20 August, and 9 countries competed with 32 boats. The event for men was held from 24 to 27 August, and 20 countries entered boats. Men competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+), and just three countries entered boats in all classes: the hosts Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and a combined German team. Women entered in five boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4x+, W4+, W8+). The regatta was held in five lanes, with rowers proceeding in the direction of the river's flow. German representation Germany had to enter a combined team. The women from both countries had a qualification event on the Langer See in Grünau, which had previously been used as the rowing venue for the 1936 Summer Olympics. The West Germans entered the three sculling boat classes only (W1x, W2x, W4x+), and in all events, the East Germans won the competition. East German teams for the coxed four and the eight complemented a complete team. East Germany nominated its men at the end of July, and following the West German national championships, the West Germans nominated their men's team in early August. There were difficult negotiations between West and East German representatives as to the location for the German qualifications. In the end, the regatta facility on the Templiner See in Potsdam favoured by East Germany was agreed to. The German qualifications were decided on 12 August, with West Germany winning all seven races. Medal summary Medallists at the 1971 European Rowing Championships were: Women's events Of the nine countries that were represented, only three were from western Europe: Great Britain (coxed four, double scull, single scull), Belgium and the Netherlands (both single scull). Of those, only Britain managed to get two of their boats into the finals; Penny Chuter came fourth in the single scull, and they came fifth in the coxed four. The most successful nation in the women's events was the Soviet Union, with four out of a possible five gold medals. {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Event ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:gold;\\" Gold ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\" Silver ! colspan=\\"2\\" c96;\\" Bronze -  style=\\"background:gold;\\" Country & rowers  style=\\"background:gold;\\" Time  style=\\"background:silver;\\" Country & rowers  style=\\"background:silver;\\" Time  c96;\\" Country & rowers  c96;\\" Time -  W1x  Kornélia Pap  3:48.9  Alena Postlová  3:52.1  Zoja Rakickaja  3:53.5 -  W2x  Valentina Kalegina Galina Samorodova  3:34.9  Hannelore Göttlich Helga Kolbe  3:37.0  Ana Tamas Florica Ghiuzelea  3:42.2 -  W4x+  Valentina Vassilieva Ljudmila Suslova Aino Paiusalu Nina Polyakova Tamara Ivanova (cox)  3:24.9  Marta Sipova Jarmila Plocarova Svetla Bartakova Hana Musilova Ivana Potocnikova (cox)  3:28.4  Helga Schlittermann-Fischer Ursula Pankraths Helga Ammon Helga Kolbe Karla Frister (cox)  3:28.8 -  W4+  Valentina Terekhova Nadeschda Skunkova Ella Sergeyeva Nina Shamanova Valentina Timofeyeva (cox)  3:28.1  Emilia Rigard Ana Tamas Florica Ghiuzelea Iuliana Bulugioiu Stefania Borisov (cox)  3:32.1  Ingrid Graf Waltraud Dinter Hilde Amelang Marianne Mewes Elfriede Boetius (cox)  3:36.9 -  W8+  Sinaida Kirillina Vera Rebrova Valentina Sirsikova Nonna Petsernikova Nina Korobkova Lidiya Zontova Zinaida Korotova Nadeschda Gontsarova Viktoriya Dobrodeeva (cox)  3:13.6  Waltraud Böhlmann Gisela Schirmer Erika Kretschmer Ute Gabler Brigitte Amm Gerlinde Löwenstein Barbara Reichel Christa Schollain-Temeier Sigrid Laube (cox)  3:17.2  Emilia Oros Maria Draghici Magda Vladut Mariana Horvath Viorica Moldovan Olimpia Bogdan Margareta Stoian Mariana Limpede Stefania Borisov (cox)  3:18.7 } Men's events The most successful nation was the Soviet Union, which won three gold medals. {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Event ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:gold;\\" Gold ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\" Silver ! colspan=\\"2\\" c96;\\" Bronze -  style=\\"background:gold;\\" Country & rowers  style=\\"background:gold;\\" Time  style=\\"background:silver;\\" Country & rowers  style=\\"background:silver;\\" Time  c96;\\" Country & rowers  c96;\\" Time -  M1x  Vyacheslav Ivanov   Vladimír Andrs   Seymour Cromwell  -  M2x  Aleksandr Berkutov Yuriy Tyukalov  6:33.6  Nicholas Birkmyre George Justicz   Václav Kozák Pavel Schmidt  -  M2-  Günther Zumkeller Dieter Bender  7:01.9  Veli Lehtelä Toimi Pitkänen   Ernst Veenemans Steven Blaisse  -  M2+  Zigmas Jukna Antanas Bagdonavičius Gerdas Morhus (cox)  7:45.3  Ionel Petrov Ilie Husarenco Oprea Păunescu (cox)   Václav Chalupa Miroslav Strejček Jan Dvorak (cox)  -  M4-  Renato Bosatta Tullio Baraglia Giancarlo Crosta Giuseppe Galante  6:28.3  Valentin Markovkin Igor Akhremchik Anatoly Tarabrin Yuri Basurov   Klaus Wegner Manfred Uellner Klaus Riekemann Günter Schroers  -  M4+  Karl-Heinz Hopp Klaus Bittner Kraft Schepke Frank Schepke Reinhold Brümmer (cox)  6:33.1  Oleg Aleksandrov Boris Fyodorov Yury Suslin Anatoli Fedorov Igor Rudakov (cox)   Vito Casalucci Michele Vertuccio Salvatore Ibba Francesco Staiti Giuseppe Giorgianni (cox)  -  M8+  Romano Sgheiz Giovanni Zucchi Raffaele Viviani Giuseppe Palese Fulvio Balatti Gianpietro Gilardi Vinico Brondi Sereno Brunello Ivo Stefanoni (cox)  5:52.2  Wolfgang Tietenberg Detlef Raatz Joachim Schulz Peter Riff Bernd-Jürgen Marschner Peter Neusel Bernhard Britting Manfred Ross Jürgen Oelke (cox)  5:52.4  Christian Puibaraud Jean-Pierre Bellet Joseph Moroni Robert Dumontois Gaston Mercier Bernard Meynadier Émile Clerc Michel Viaud Alain Bouffard (cox)  }  Medals tables  The first table shows the aggregate results for men and women with Germany counted as one country.

Early life  Adams was born in Ireland. She moved to the United States in 1898, living in Brunswick County, North Carolina, and later settling in Norfolk, Virginia. She married Norfolk physician Walter J. Adams; he established a medical practice and she gave birth to two sons. The Norfolk Equal Suffrage League was organized during a meeting in her home on November 18, 1910. She was elected the first president of the Norfolk League and served two more terms before refusing to run again. Unlike other suffragists, she advocated a militant approach, shunning the chance to speak in an educational manner during Woodrow Wilson's inaugural in Washington, DC. Her militant stance prompted a rift in the Norfolk League and would earn her a reprimand from the state League headquarters in Richmond.  Suffrage activities  In August 1913, she was one of 300 delegates to a suffrage conference in Washington, DC; she was one of three members from the State of Virginia. She became president of Norfolk division of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage from 1917 to 1920. She and twelve other picketers were arrested 'for attempting to \\"flaunt their banners\\" in front of Woodrow Wilson's reviewing stand before a Selective Service parade on September 4, 1917.' They chose prison over a $25.00 fine and were sent to the workhouse at Occoquan, in Fairfax County, Virginia. Adams spent time in solitary confinement deprived of personal grooming items. The heated exchange between her and the judge was reported as follows: After she was released, she and nine others were treated to a dinner at Cameron House in Washington, DC. A newspaper reports that the detainees were cut off from all contact with the outside world and were without books or writing material during their incarceration. They were released on November 4, 1917. In December 1917, she and five other \\"pickets\\" filed an appeal with the decision of the Police Court, charging that their rights were 'flagrantly disregarded in the trial court and that they were not accorded a fair and impartial trial'. The appeal was successful. 'The court held the information against the suffragettes was too vague, general and uncertain to warrant a conviction.' Other activities Adams was a proponent of the Esperanto language. In 1913, she invented two popular suffrage games that were sold in Virginia and Maryland; the funds raised were used to support her suffrage work. After passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in August 1920, she looked for new challenges. She passed the bar exam in 1921 and became the second woman to practice law in Norfolk. She was also involved in politics, working on the campaign of Sarah Lee Fain and running unsuccessfully for city council. She died in 1957 and was buried in Norfolk.

It is the 28th overall episode of the series and is written by David Slack and directed by Jeffrey Hunt. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on November 1, 2012. The title refers to the news term \\"Bury the lead\\". To \\"bury the lead\\" is to begin the article with background information or details of secondary importance to the readers, forcing them to read more deeply into an article than they should have to in order to discover the essential point(s) Plot New York is on the days before the mayoral elections take place. The candidates are Councilman Ed Griffin (Richard V. Licata) and Assistant DA Landon Walker (Kevin Collins). A reporter named Maxine Angelis (Gloria Votsis) has gotten information regarding Griffin's illegal fundraising. She has become the newest number as her articles have exposed multiple criminal organizations. Meanwhile, the FBI conducts raids to arrest HR members in the NYPD. Fusco (Kevin Chapman) is contacted by Simmons (Robert John Burke), who states that Fusco must retrieve information regarding HR as they and the unidentified HR leader are among the few remaining in HR. Later, Maxine receives a call from an unknown man, who states that HR's leader is Christopher Zambrano (John Ventimiglia), son of a Don they've encountered before. She contacts an FBI agent who states that Zambrano is a possible target. Maxine confronts Zambrano but he denies his involvement. Getting evidence from an FBI agent, she publishes the story with Zambrano as the leader of HR. Reese (Jim Caviezel) also discovers that Maxine is planning to expose \\"The Man in the Suit\\" and he needs to save her without exposing himself. Finch (Michael Emerson) then has Reese pose as a date for Maxine on a dating website. Reese poses as \\"John Anderson\\" and dines with Maxine on a restaurant, nearly blowing his cover until Finch uses Zoe Morgan (Paige Turco) as a contingency plan. The date is cut short when Maxine receives a call and Reese is notified by Carter (Taraji P. Henson) that Maxine's story is wrong as Zambrano is not the real leader but the rest of the HR members will go after him. Reese and Maxine arrive at Zambrano's office but find him dead. Agent Donnelly (Brennan Brown) interrogates Maxine, explaining that Zambrano was person who could have led them to the HR leader as Zambrano found a ledger that contained the names of the HR member on its payroll. Reese takes Maxine on another date but they are ambushed by HR assassins, which they manage to avoid and escape to Reese's loft. Finch notifies Reese that the assassins were ex FBI agents who got the information from Donnelly and used it to track down Maxine. Reese and Maxine meet with Zoe, who provides info into the agents and suggesting that one of electoral candidates may be the boss. Taking an advice said earlier by Zambrano, Reese and Maxine go to a carousel he built. They find the ledger but are cornered by the HR agents. Carter and Fusco arrive and shoot at the HR agents until they're defeated. Fusco retrieves the ledger and rips off the pages concerning him and Simmons before handing it back. Maxine uses the ledger to publish that Walker is the boss and Walker is arrested, making Griffin the new Mayor. Maxine tells Reese that due to her work, she would stop seeing him but implies that she knows about his identity. However, Finch expresses doubt on Walker being the leader. Somewhere, Simmons meets with Alonzo Quinn (Clarke Peters), Griffin's campaign manager and HR's true leader. Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Bury the Lede\\" was seen by an estimated 13.66 million household viewers and gained a 2.9/7 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 14.03 million viewers with a 2.9/8 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night, beating Elementary but behind Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory, first on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Two and a Half Men, 2012 Country Music Association Awards, and The Big Bang Theory. With Live +7 DVR factored in, the episode was watched by 16.81 million viewers with a 3.8 in the 18-49 demographics. Critical reviews \\"Bury the Lede\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Bury The Lede' — the title is a hint that Reese and Finch will be getting their Tom Paine on and defending the freedom of the press, using fiery rhetoric and the occasional punch to the throat —features Gloria Votsis as the wonderfully named Maxine Angelis, a fearless investigative reporter for the New York Journal, which appears to be a newspaper, the kind that newsstand venders actually charge money for. Person Of Interest knows that viewers can only take so many science-fiction elements with their procedural drama, and it's easier to believe that New York is supporting one extra newspaper than that a genuine investigative reporter could make it past security at either Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal or the New York Times that could scarcely contain its pride over having Judith Miller on staff.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com wrote \\"Last night gave us a pretty nifty episode of Person of Interest in 'Bury the Lede,' which asked an intriguing question: How can we reverse engineer an episode's story in order to end up with a shootout on a merry-go-round? The answer was a complex case involving a headstrong (and sexy!) investigative journalist, a mayoral race, a bunch of dirty cops, and an awkward first date. 'Bury the Lede' hit a lot of vintage Person of Interest sweet spots, combining humor, an ever-expanding mythology, and some incredibly ridiculous circumstances. Whenever an episode does all this, the show is damn near unstoppable.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.2 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"It's not often that the smaller moments shine more for me than the bigger story, but I just had more fun with the likes of Reese trying out dating or Finch on doggy duty. But that's the great thing about Person of Interest: it stays fresh, it tries out new things and it still finds a variety of ways to make the hour enjoyable.\\"  References  External links * \\"Bury the Lede\\" at CBS * * \\"Bury the Lede\\" at TV Guide * Category:Person of Interest (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Bury the Lede (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"56150115","text":"Milwaukee, Minnesota is a 2003 American drama film starring Troy Garity, Alison Folland, Bruce Dern and Randy Quaid.

They are the first officially licensed video games to be based on the Redwall book series since its introduction in 1986, and began production following a successful Kickstarter campaign for the Minecraft map \\"AbbeyCraft\\" in 2013. Originally titled Redwall: The Adventure Game and later Redwall: The Warrior Reborn for much of its development, the series' working title was changed to Epic Tales of Redwall before arriving at its final branding. The games tell a new story within the Redwall universe set before and during the first book, and features characters and settings from the novel. The initial episode, \\"The Scout\\", was made available on Steam Early Access beginning December 18, 2017, with a full release on September 14, 2018. A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release came in summer 2019 and subsequent episodes for all intended platforms are planned for distribution in the near future.  Development  In 2012, the writing team of brothers Christopher and Alan Miller had acquired the licensing rights to the Redwall book series from the Redwall Abbey Company with the intent of making a feature film. That same year, Christopher launched a website and Facebook page for a video game concept he announced he was working on with the assistance of series illustrator Sean Rubin. Originally titled Redwall: The Adventure Game, the title was intended to be released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, mobile phones, and tablets in Fall 2012. After talks with Miller throughout that year, independent developer Soma Games optioned the video game rights for the franchise in 2013 and the took over primary development of the title, now called Redwall: The Warrior Reborn. Soma Games launched a Kickstarter campaign which ran from April to May of that year to allocate funds for a Redwall-themed Minecraft map called \\"AbbeyCraft\\", with all additional funds over the target going toward the adventure game itself. As Soma Games CTO Chris Skaggs remarked, \\"Developing a Minecraft map and server as the first step of the adventure game allows us to create ways for Redwall fans and the Minecraft community to actively participate and evolve the game in a meaningful and authentic way.\\" The campaign successfully raised $17,618 of the developers' $11,000 goal, reaching the first stretch goal for adding the location of St. Ninian's Church to AbbeyCraft, which was later released on Soma Games' website on August 9, 2013. Although the game was intended for release in Summer 2014, financial difficulties and \\"tons of paperwork\\" meant development proper could not begin until Soma Games secured additional funding. In September 2014, the company's website issued a pitch for interested partners to support the project, and in February 2015 announced that the non-profit organization The McClellan Group had joined them as a backer. Throughout 2015, the company took part in a Praxis Labs business accelerator where they completed all art and pre-production steps on the title and began a \\"grassroots\\" marketing campaign. Soma Games announced in July 2017 that the first episode of The Warrior Reborn had been greenlit for Steam Early Access, with the game's preliminary market page added to the site. The Early Access version was originally going to be available on September 29, 2017, but was pushed back to December 18 of that year under its new title, An Epic Tale of Redwall. The title was changed once more in March 2017 to The Lost Legends of Redwall following concerns by Random House and The Redwall Abbey Company that the previous one was too close to the branding \\"A Tale of Redwall\\" seen on some Redwall novels. On September 14, 2018, the first episode, \\"The Scout\\", was officially released on Steam for Windows and macOS. Soma Games initially stated that they wanted to make Legends of Redwall a \\"'progressive adventure' designed for multi-platform deployment\\" with primary development beginning on Windows and Mac with \\"tablets as secondary. A console option is a maybe.\\" The title was later released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019.

It was released a day shy of Kudo's 30th anniversary, on August 30, 2017, through Pony Canyon. The album marks Kudo's first studio album in over twelve years and includes nine original songs written by Japanese singer-songwriters Koji Tamaki, Tak Matsumoto and Kaori Kishitani, among others. it also features various collaborations with veteran songwriters, including lyricist Gorō Matsui, a long-time collaborator of Kudo's, as well as with new talent, such as Niconico utaite Mafumafu, the singer-songwriter duo Yoshida Yamada and first-time songwriter and author Shizuka Ijūin, while Kudo serves as the album's executive producer. The album was released in two versions: a standard edition and a limited, first press edition, which comes with two DVDs including 34 of Kudo's earlier music videos as well as three new ones for the songs \\"Hagane no Mori\\", \\"Kasumisō\\", and \\"Kinki to Tsukiakari\\". It charted at number 21 on the Oricon Albums Chart, marking Kudo's highest-charting studio album in close to twenty years, since I'm Not (1999). Background Kudo announced the release of Rin via a press release on July 28, 2017. It is her first studio album in twelve years, since Tsukikage. Kudo explained in an interview with Yahoo! Japan that she decided two years prior to the album's release that she wanted to create an album of new, original material for her fans to mark her 30th anniversary as a solo singer. The singer told Yahoo: \\"As a token of my gratitude to my loyal fans, I wanted to create every song on the record from scratch.\\" Despite Pony Canyon executives floating around the idea of possibly throwing older songs into the mix, Kudo declined, insisting on only presenting new songs to her audience. Writing and composition On her collaboration with B'z guitarist Tak Matsumoto on the song \\"Mitsu to Toge\\", Kudo explains that during the writing process for the album, she had recalled Matsumoto casually promising, roughly twenty years prior, to compose a song for her. When she reconnected with Matsumoto, she asked him for a \\"manly\\" hard rock song, which she reveals to Yahoo, is her favorite musical genre. She originally was going to write the lyrics to go along with the resulting track, but changed her mind and tasked author Shizuka Ijūin, whom she had met at a prior work function, to write them instead. For the album, Kudo recorded \\"Junk\\", a song written by her longtime friend, Princess Princess vocalist Kaori Kishitani. Kudo tells Yahoo that Kishitani presented her with four different songs and let her pick her favorite. Kishitani then asked her what kind of lyrics she had in mind for the track she picked, to which Kudo replied she wanted the song's message to be about \\"down-to-earth living\\". Kishitani created an assertive anthem that Kudo was thrilled to record, stating: \\"you can't behave like I do on this song in real life.\\" Kudo worked with guitarist and longtime collaborator Taisuke Sawachika on the song \\"Dōse Nara\\". She refers to the song as one of the album's \\"standout\\" tracks; according to Kudo, she was drawn to the song because of its \\"cool factor\\". She singled out the opening line of the first chorus Sawachika wrote, and the \\"mouthful\\" of lyrics she sings throughout the song, as its most impressive aspects. \\"Hotori\\", co- written by Gorō Matsui and Koji Tamaki, came about because Kudo specifically requested the two collaborate on a song together. She explained to Yahoo: \\"I was curious to find out what [Tamaki]'s songs would sound like sung by a woman.\\" Kudo wanted the song to evoke a sensation of floating and was pleased that Matsui's sparse lyrics didn't include any situating details. Kudo wrote the lyrics for \\"Hagane no Mori\\", one of the more pop-sounding tracks of the record, with the intention of creating a fight song for herself and her fans. The song is about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel when the world seems bleak. She further explained to Yahoo: \\"I wanted to sing from a hopeful point of view and to let the listener know that, when you feel like you're struggling to move in a bottomless pit of mud, you don't have to sink in the dark, but you can instead move towards the future ahead.\\" Kudo admits even she got teary-eyed writing the song. The song was composed by Kudo's 14-year-old daughter, Kōki. She also worked on the nostalgic \\"Kasumisō\\". Kudo recalled: \\"When I first read the title, an image of fluttering cherry blossoms came to mind. It was a very Japonesque visual, especially when matched with the striking opening notes of the song.\\" She discussed with Kōki about altering the song to fit that initial image, and together they came up with a track that would be complemented by Kudo's higher vocal register. Kudo was struck with the idea to work with younger songwriters like Kōki about a decade prior, stating that on previous records she had been more stubborn about her vision, but that lately she had come to value the opinions of the younger generation of musicians. The backing harmonies during the verses are one of the ideas suggested by Kōki that Kudo felt she had to incorporate into the song. Mafumafu of the band After the Rain wrote \\"Kinki to Tsukiakari\\". \\"He explained the song to me very politely,\\" Kudo reveals of her first interaction with Mafumafu. \\"He's very particular with word choice and the overall message of the song,\\" she adds, stating that his earnestness made her want to give it her all during the recording of the song. Kudo explained that despite its pop melody, the creative process for the song was different from the usual pop song. She noted that Mafumafu was more introspective than songwriters from her generation. She channeled her inner introvert when recording \\"Kinki to Tsukiakari\\" which she said was the correct approach for the song. Yoshida Yamada, a duo consisting of singer-songwriters Yui Yoshida and Yoshitaka Yamada, wrote the penultimate ballad \\"Hari\\". Speaking on the song, Kudo states: \\"The words and the music are lovely. It's not just a sad song, it has a sympathetic core. I love it.\\" She noted that the song is very true to character to Yoshida Yamada, whom she described as two gentle and considerate artists. The album closes with the powerful ballad \\"Time After Time\\", written by Matsui and composed by Kōki. Kudo points out that it has an unusual type of composition and refers to the song as a challenge. She chose it to be the closing track because she was very fond of the very last lyric: \\"fukaku atatakai kono negai\\", which loosely translates to \\"this deep heartfelt wish\\". Artwork The cover art for the album's standard and limited editions were both photographed by Kazumi Kurigami. The standard edition cover features Kudo wearing her own hand-made jewelry and striking a \\"dignified\\" pose, which is meant to evoke \\"progress and defiance\\". About her decision to have Kurigami shoot the cover, Kudo stated: \\"I decided a long time ago that Kurigami would immortalize all the big moments of my career.\\" She explained that Rin is the album that ignited her desire to keep creating new music, a similar resolve she experienced when she completed the recording sessions for her debut album, Mysterious. Promotion On August 2, 2017, Kudo appeared on the annual CX music show FNS Uta no Natsu Matsuri, where she performed her song \\"Arashi no Sugao\\" with longtime friends and fellow singers Chisato Moritaka and Kaori Kishitani. On September 1, 2017, she appeared on the AX variety show Buzzrhythm where she was interviewed and performed the Mafumafu-penned \\"Kinki to Tsukiakari\\" off the album. On September 14, 2017, Kudo performed a medley of hit songs, and \\"Hagane no Mori\\" from Rin, on a special episode of NHK's music show Songs as well as being interviewed by columnist Gō Yoshida. On September 30, 2017, she appeared on CX music show Music Fair and performed \\"Hagane no Mori\\" to promote Rin, as well as other songs with fellow guests, Sukima Switch and Dream Ami. The song \\"Dōse Nara\\" was used as the ending theme to the AX morning show Pon!. Promotional singles Kudo released three songs off the album, spread out over three consecutive weeks, as promotional singles to the official Pony Canyon YouTube channel, each accompanied by a music video created by Pixiv artists. On August 4, 2017, she released a short version of the music video for \\"Kinki to Tsukiakari\\" on the YouTube channel as the first promotional single for Rin.

She was a West Indiaman until 1812 when she made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). On her return she returned to trading with the West Indies. However, she then performed two voyages transporting convicts, the first to Van Diemen's Land, and the second to New South Wales. She ran into difficulties on her way home from Singapore after the second voyage and was condemned at Mauritius. Career West Indiaman Sir Godfrey first appears in Lloyd's Register in 1799 with Spencer, master, Plumber, owner, and trade London–Jamaica.Lloyd's Register (17699), Seq. №S515. Captain William Spencer acquired a letter of marque on 1 November. On 9 November 1800 Sir Godfrey was among the vessels caught in a tremendous gale at Deal in which she lost cables and anchors.Lloyd's List №4101. On 7 November 1806 Godfrey was sailing from London to Jamaica when she ran ashore on North Sand Head. However, boats from Deal got her off and she had suffered little damage.Lloyd's List №4097. On 26 October 1807, Captain John Luxon Bruton acquired a letter of marque. However, on 2 November, Captain Peter Walker acquired one also. Lloyd's Register for 1807 showed Sir Godfreys master changing from Bruton to Walker. It also showed her owner as Taylor & Co. However, her trade was still London–Jamaica.Lloyd's Register (1807), Seq. №S379. Lloyd's Register for 1810 showed Sir Godfreys master changing from Walker to Dawson. Her owner was still Taylor & Co. and her trade was still London–Jamaica. Captain John Dawson acquired a letter of marque on 21 April 1810. EIC voyage In 1811 the EIC had Sir Godfrey repaired by Mestaer and measured. Captain James Pearson acquired a letter of marque on 10 April 1812.Letter of Marque, p.86 - accessed 25 July 2017. Captain Pearson sailed from Falmouth on 15 May 1812, bound for Bengal. Sir Godfrey reached Madeira on 3 June and arrived at Calcutta on 3 November. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 18 January 1813. On 13 March she was at Point de Galle. She was damaged in a storm on 26 April and forced to seek repairs. A series of reports in Lloyd List provided varied information. On 10 August 1813 it reported that Sir Godfrey was one of three vessels that had parted from the fleet to Portsmouth in a storm between 23 and 26 April near Mauritius.Lloyd's List №4794. Then on 22 October Lloyd's List passed on a report that Sir Godfrey had put into Maruitius.Lloyd's List №4815. Then on 2 November Lloyd's List reported that Sir Godfrey had put into Mauritius dismasted.Lloyd's List №4818. Three days later Lloyd's List stated that the report that Sir Godfrey had put into Mauritius was uncertain.Lloyd's List №4819. Four days after that, on 9 November, Lloyd's List reported that Sir Godfrey had not been heard from since she parted from the fleet at end-April had not been heard of since.Lloyd's List №4520. Lastly, Lloyd's List reported on 10 December that Sir Godfrey had put into Bombay dismasted and was going into dock at end June for repairs,Lloyd's List №4820. Sir Godfrey arrived at Bombay on 5 June. Sir Godfrey was leaving Bombay in October for London when she grounded. She had to return to dock and was expected to remain there for a month to six weeks.Lloyd's List 6 May 1814. She left on 20 December. On 5 January 1814 she was again at Point de Galle. She left with the fleet on 11 January.Lloyd's List 17 May 1814. She reached the Cape of Good Hope on 1 March and St Helena on 25 March. She arrived at The Downs on 2 June.British Library: Sir Godfrey Webster. West Indiaman Lloyd's Register for 1814 shows Sir Godfreys master changing from Dawson to Boyes. Neither Lloyd's Register nor the Register of Shipping appears to have recorded the voyage for the EIC. The 1814 volume of Lloyd's Register still shows her owner as Taylor & Co., and her trade as London–Jamaica. (The Registers were only as accurate as owners chose to make them.) The 1815 issue shows her owner as Plummer & Co., and her trade as London–Jamaica. On 26 November 1819, Sir Godfrey, Boyes, master, ran onshore on the rocks of Folkstone while sailing from London to Jamaica. Boats got her off and she proceeded to Portsmouth to go into dock.Lloyd's List №5443. Lloyd's Register for 1822 showed Sir Godfreys master changing from Boyes to Telfer, and her owner from Plummer to W. Fellow.Lloyd's Register (1822), №S462. On 12 May 1822 Vine, of Arbroath, Stephen, master, wrecked on the Kentish Knock, in the North Sea off Margate, Kent. Sir Godfrey, Telfer, master, rescued the crew some 18 hours later. Vine was on a voyage from Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland to Caen, Calvados, France. Part of the wreck was towed into Whitstable.Lloyd's List №5669. Convict transport Lloyd's Register for 1823 shows Sir Godfrey as having undergone a large repair in 1823. It also shows her master as Renoldson, her owner as Soames, and her trade as London–New South Wales.Lloyd's Register (1823), Supple. \\"S\\", №S43. Captain John Rennoldson sailed from London on 1 September 1823 and arrived at Hobart Town on 30 December. She had embarked 180 male convicts, none of whom died on the voyage. Two officers and 33 men of the 40th Regiment of Foot provided the guard. Captain Rennoldson sailed from Gravesend on 3 June 1825 and arrived at Cork on 16 June. He sailed from Cork on 11 July, stopping at Tenriffe and the Cape of Good Hope on the Way to Sydney. Sir Godfrey arrived at Sydney on 3 January 1826. She had embarked 196 male convicts at Cork, three of whom died on the journey. Two officers and 33 men of the 57th Regiment of Foot provided the guard; they brought with them several wives and children. Fate A letter dated Mauritius 22 August 1826 reported that Sir Godfrey had put into Mauritius as she was sailing from Singapore and Penang for London. She was in a shattered condition and it was believed that she would not be able to resume her journey. A second letter dated August 28 reported that Captain Rennoldson had died two days earlier and that Sir Godfrey would be surveyed within the course of the week.Lloyd's List №6173. On 15 October she was condemned as unseaworthy and sold for breaking up. Sir Godfrey had undergone minor repairs at Sydney, Singapore, and Penang, and had picked up a cargo in Singapore in May. On her way home after a gale she started leaking badly and had to put into Mauritius. There she underwent three surveys, with Rennoldson dying between the first and the second. The mate took command. He determined after the surveys and taking quotes for repair costs that she was no longer worth repairing and sold her for breaking up. Her owners claimed against her insurance for total loss. The insurance took the matter to court, arguing in the case of Somes vs. Sugrue, that she could have been repaired. The jury found in favor of the insurance company, but the court permitted a retrial on the grounds that the jury had found against the evidence.Reports... (1831), pp.382-6.

He is known as one of the founders of the Soviet school of traditional and stop motion animation.Giannalberto Bendazzi (2016). Animation: A World History: Volume I: Foundations - The Golden Age at Google Books, p. 76—79Sergey Kapkov (2006). Encyclopedia of Domestic Animation, p. 433-434, 14 Early years Yuri Merkulov was born in the Rasskazovo village (modern-day town of Rasskazovo, Tambov Oblast of Russia) into a wealthy Russian family. He was one of the seven children of Alexander Nikolaevich Merkulov (1869—1924), a prominent surgeon and a member of the Russian Society of Doctors who inspected, organized and reorganized medical clinics all over the country. During World War I he headed one of the Moscow military hospitals, and after the October Revolution he founded the Moscow Institute of Traumatology, working closely with Nikolai Semashko. Yuri's mother Maria Karlovna Merkulova (1870—1944) was a professional piano player who dedicated herself to raising children.The Stars of Russian Animation.

Necropolis of the Novodevichy Cemetery. — Moscow: Propilei, p. 93 Merkulov Alexander Nikolaevich at the General Alphabetical Catalogue of Russian-language Books, National Library of Russia (in Russian) Yuri became interested in art early in his life and entered Fyodor Rerberg's Moscow School of Painting. During the war he and his sisters worked at their father's hospital, mending wounded soldiers. He then served in the Soviet Navy and on his return joined Vkhutemas where he studied under Ilya Mashkov until 1923. He became closely associated with the Soviet Avant-Garde art movement, taking part in various progressive coalitions, including Vladimir Mayakovsky's collective of modern artists where he drew ROSTA posters and designed scenery for the Mystery-Bouffe play, among other things. Together with Daniil Cherkes he also decorated agit-trains; it was during that time they came up with the idea of \\"animated posters\\", the earliest kind of Soviet animation based on the art by Dmitry Moor, Viktor Deni and Mikhail Cheremnykh.Animation from A to Z by Irina Margolina and Eduard Nazarov, episodes 15, 22—23, REN TV, 1997 (in Russian) Career In 1923 Merkulov along with Nikolai Khodataev and Zenon Komissarenko produced sketches for the Aelita science fiction movie. As Yakov Protazanov rejected the idea of mixing live action with animation, the three founded their own experimental workshop under the State School of Cinematography, the first Soviet animation studio. By 1924 they finished Interplanetary Revoluion — a cutout animation parody on Aelita and the current political situation that became very popular.Larisa Malyukova (2013). OVERcinema. Modern Russian animation. — Saint Petersburg: Umnaya Masha, p. 264 In a year they were hired by the Soviet government to produce China in Flames, another political satire critical of European interference in Chinese economy. Vladimir Suteev, Ivan Ivanov-Vano and the Brumberg sisters joined the team which led to a variety of styles. With 1000 meters of film and 14 frames per second it ran over 50 minutes at the time, which made it the first Soviet animated feature film and one of the first in the world. After that Merkulov, Khodataev and Komissarenko went their own ways. China in Flames (1925) In 1926 Yuri joined Mezhrabpom-Rus and organized an animation department there. Together with Ivanov-Vano he drew animated sequences for Vsevolod Pudovkin's Mechanics of the Brain, the first Soviet popular science movie that received praise from both Ivan Pavlov and international medical specialists. His old friend Daniil Cherkes joined them in their next project — a live-action animated film Senka the African (1927) based on the comedy poem by Korney Chukovsky about a little boy who travelled to Africa on a balloon. It combined hand-drawn and cutout scenes with live action sequences, becoming one of the first Soviet films aimed at children along with The Skating Rink by Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky. Merkulov also directed animated sequences for A Kiss from Mary Pickford comedy movie. In 1928 he launched the first Soviet animated series Bratishkin's Adventures at Mosfilm, this time combining live action with stop motion animation to tell short comedy stories that involved Bratishkin — a tiny sailor who travelled through Moscow taking part in all sort of real-life events. He was joined by the young Alexander Ptushko who helped him creating dolls and sets, and eventually took the director's chair. By that time Merkulov had already moved to Gosvoenkino (studio dedicated to military documentaries) where he, Leonid Amalrik and Lev Atamanov started an animation workshop. Their most famous project was The First Cavalry (1929) inspired by the 1st Cavalry Army that fought under Semyon Budyonny during the Russian Civil War. Merkulov became obsessed with it back in 1919 when he heard stories by one of the wounded soldiers. Once again the crew combined live action and animation using various techniques. Eduard Tisse conducted the complex cinematography. The film turned a huge success and supported Merkulov's family for several years. He continued working on documentaries and animated agitprop, although by the mid-1930s he started switching to other projects. As an engineer he constructed amusement rides for the Central Park of Culture and Leisure, including a full-size interactive seaplane model equipped with a shooting range. In 1939 he was put in charge of the first exhibition dedicated to the Soviet Navy that took place in the Central Park. He also worked as a conservator-restorer on the Vorontsov Palace in Crimea and planned to create a Museum of Naval Glory there with a panoramic view, although this never happened. In addition he worked a lot as an artist and drew top-selling agitation posters.Merkulov Yuri Alexandrovich (1901–1979) at the Soviet Poster website (in Russian) Late years Merkulov took part in the Great Patriotic War and on his return continued the art career. Only during the 1950s he turned back to cinema. Between 1955 and 1965 he created animated sequences for many live action movies, including the science fiction film I Was a Satellite of the Sun (1959) and Grigori Aleksandrov's Russian Souvenir (1960). He also directed several propaganda animated shorts similar to those he had been involved back in the 1920s, such as Prosecute Bread Thieves! (1965), although there was no demand for it anymore. In addition he played episodic roles of Russian noblemen and landlords in historical dramas: his aristocratic appearance attracted film directors. Yuri Merkulov died in 1979 and was buried in the family tomb at the Novodevichy Cemetery. He was married to Antonina Vasilievna Merkulova whom he met in Crimea. They had a daughter Nina.

Fahey was born Esther Edmonds in New York City, the daughter of painter Abraham Edmonds, who was among her teachers; she also had lessons at the Art Students League of New York and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was a graduate of the Cooper Union. Her family moved to South Carolina, where with her father she opened a studio in Columbia in 1910. The following year Abraham was offered a commission from the United States House of Representatives to produce a portrait of James Lawrence Orr, onetime Speaker of that body, to hang in the United States Capitol. He died prior to its completion, and Esther took it up in his stead. The completed work is now part of the United States Capitol collection. At its accession, coming as it did at the same time as a portrait of John Griffin Carlisle by Ellen Day Hale, the number of works in the Capitol art collection by women artists was doubled. In 1917 Edmonds married William Fahey, and in 1920 moved to Washington, D.C. after living for a time in New Orleans. She remained in Washington for much of the rest of her life, dividing time in her later years between the homes of her two daughters in Potomac, Maryland and Stockton, California before dying in the latter town in 1976. She is interred in the Parklawn Memorial Park and Menorah Gardens in Rockville, Maryland. There is some confusion in the literature over elements of Fahey's biography; notably, she was active at the same time as another artist, Esther Topp Edmonds of Pittsburgh. As a result, the middle name \\"Topp\\" has been given to her by some writers, but this is almost certainly erroneous. Some sources further confuse the issue by ascribing the work of one of the two artists to the other. Her maiden name is also given as Edmunds by some writers.

Biography  Moisés Canelas Withol, was born on July 9, 1950 in the village of Francia, of the municipality of Limón, department of Colón in the republic of Honduras. Because he was small, Moisés distinguished himself when he was young by singing in the banana fields of Coyoles Central. While in primary school at the Escuela Francisco Morazán in La Ceiba, he built on this foundation acting and singing on stage.  Musical career  Moisés demonstrated artistic aptitude as a singer from age eight. As a teenager looking for ways to earn money singing, he joined the Banda Los Robbin´s of La Ceiba along with his childhood friend Ricardo Pereira. Later he performed in the group Happy Boy's in Tela, Honduras, where he wrote his first hit song, Noche de luna en La Ceiba. After recording their first single in the seventies, Moisés and the group became famous in Honduras and were invited to make musical tours, including his first international tour to the United States.  Musical festivals as soloist and recorded works  A Nicaraguan recording firm became interested in Canelo and invited him to record an LP (Long Play) alone. He accepted the agreement and the recording was made in Panama. Moisés Canelo's song \\"Yo también soy sentimental\\" from this recording was heard on Central American radios in the seventies and early eighties. Another record label followed, this time he recorded other works in the city of New Orleans. Then he participated in the International Song Festival OTI Festival 1974 held in the city and port of Acapulco, in which Moisés Canelo represented Honduras with the song \\"Río viejo, viejo amigo\\" composed by Horacio Cadalso. Mexicans were delighted with the voice of the Honduran, so Mexico became the singer's second home. Canelo interpreted his melodies in the famous Cardini Night Center located in Colonia Polanco. In 1970 Canelo in Honduras made a huge presentation at the Club Hondureño Árabe in Tegucigalpa. Afterwards, he was again asked to represent Honduras at the 1976 Song Festival in Panama. Moisés performed the song \\"Latinoamericana\\" composed by maestro Alberto Ángel, nicknamed \\"El Cuervo\\", and obtained three awards: Best song, Best performance, and Best musical arrangement. Moisés represented Honduras again at the International Song Festival OTI 1980, this time in the city of Buenos Aires, Republic of Argentina, where his performance of the song \\"Tú, mi siempre tú\\", by composer Alberto Valladares, earned him seventh place with 22 points. Canelo afterwards, with the help of Horacio Cadalso, moved to Mexico to study. In Mexico he recorded the work \\"Muchacho pobrey\\" with help from Francisco \\"Paco\\" from the company Discos Orfeón. This work was picked up by radio broadcasters. Subsequently, Canelo worked with Luis Rubio of the RCA Victor Company to record three LPs: \\"Te quiero cada día más\\" and \\"Llegaste tú\\" entirely of his own composition, in addition to the song \\"Por amores como tú\\" composed by Canelo and the Peruvian composer Edwin Alvarado. Afterwards, Canelo's recording works were on his independent labe. \\"“Esta Cobardía\\", \\"Un buen Perdedor\\" and \\"Mensajero del Amor\\" provided the official theme of the visit of the pontiff John Paul II to Central America in the month of March 1983 . The themes were also broadcast on Vatican Radio as a background to Spanish language transmissions. Other recorded works were recompilation LP of \\"Tangos\\". The Mexican presenter Jorge Saldaña of Channel 13 today \\"TV Azteca\\", supported him in his auditions and presentations. Also in Mexico, Moisés Canelo, with the help of Marco Antonio Lugo, recorded the song \\"Amor Pirata\\" by the composer Paz Martínez, recorded by the company Discos Continental de México. This theme moved Canelo to international prominence. Canelo was based in Mexico for twenty-four years. Back in his native Honduras, Moisés Canelo looked for a way to produce a new work. That's how the song \\"Honduras, Vaya pues\\" and other more traditional Honduran repertoire, which envelops the magical notes of the marimba with sounds of the Marimba USULA of San Pedro Sula. Canelo has developed his artistic talents as a singer-songwriter with the help of well known professionals, such as the teacher Ana Grave de Peralta, with Solfeggio, and in classical guitar performance with Gonzalo Torres; Vocalization, with Mario Zea; Harmony, with Joaquín Pessina; and stage performance with Sergio Bustamante. All these individuals in one way or another helped develop him as an artist. Honduran journalist Víctor Donaire, in an interview with the newspaper El Heraldo considers Moisés Canelo \\"the most romantic voice that has lasted the longest on the national artistic scene\\".  Presentations with Famous Performers  Among famous hispanoamerican musicians, he performed with : Armando Manzanero, Carlos Lico, Camilo Sesto, Gualberto Castro, José José, Juan Gabriel, Marco Antonio Muñiz, Miguel Aceves Mejía, Moarés Moreira, Los Ángeles Negros, Pedro Vargas, Roberto Carlos, Rocío Jurado, Sandro and Vicente Fernández, among others.

Joseph Mayer (1846 – November 27, 1909) was an American businessman, gold prospector and pioneer who founded the town of Mayer, Arizona. Early years Mayer (birth name: Joseph Hoffmayer) was born in Olean, New York, to French immigrants. He didn't get along with his strict father and believed that his family favored his brother \\"Gus\\" over him. Therefore, he ran away from home when he was a teenager. He worked in various places including a cigar store and a cracker factory. After living on his own for several months he became interested in joining the troupe of a wild west circus which was performing in his town.\\"Joe Mayer and His Town\\"; by Winifred L. Thorpe; Journal of Arizona History; Vol. 19 #2, Summer, 1978, pp 131–168.\\"French Runaway in Arizona\\"; By Sharlot Hall Museum Archives: Vertical file-Biography-Mayer, Joseph.\\"Builders of Yavapai: Something About the Man Who Recognized the Big Possibilities in Store for Mayer\\" Yavapai Magazine; March 1918, Pg. 3. Mayer was assigned to do various chores in the circus and he visited many western towns. Eventually, he did what so many other American easterners were doing at the time and moved to the west coast in search of gold. He changed his surname to \\"Mayer\\" because he did not want his family in New York to find him and went to Silver City, New Mexico. There he met Sarah Belle Wilbur.An Illustrated History of Mayer: Stagecoaches, Mining, Ranching and the Railroad; By: Nancy Burgess; ; Big Bug Stage Station Marker which indicates the location of \\"Big Bug Station\\" He and Sarah moved to Globe, Arizona, where they were married. Mayer and Sarah had four children. The children were named Mary Bell (1878–1964), Martha Gertrude (1881–1967), Wilbur Joseph (1882–1955) and Winifred Lucille (1892–1983). He spent a year mining in Globe; however by 1881, Mayer moved and began mining in the Tip Top Mine by Cottonwood Creek in Central Arizona. There he opened a restaurant and a store. Although he was successful as a businessman, his businesses were affected by the decline of the mine and the decline of the mining camp which depended on it. On one occasion he had to go to the city of Prescott and decided to take a short cut from the Black Canyon Trail. During his trip, he made a stop at the “Big Bug Stage Station”, a stage stop on the Black Canyon Stage Line. The station was located on the outskirts of Big Bug Creek. Mayer was impressed with the area and he purchased the “Big Bug Stage Station” for $1,200 in gold. Mayer then moved there with his wife Sarah and children. Mayer, Arizona The Big Bug Stage Station was located in an area which was surrounded by the Bradshaw Mountains. The area was once inhabited by the Hohokams, a Native American tribe, and later by their descendants the Yavapai. This was before the arrival and settlement of the area by the people of Anglo European descent from the east coast of the United States. The Black Canyon trail from Prescott to Phoenix was dangerous and many travelers were robbed of their belongings and sometimes murdered either by the Yavapai or the thieves who roamed the area. Miners would often stop at the Mayers' place to rest and to patronize the store which he had built. In 1882, Mayer officially founded the town which bears his name. In 1884, his wife Sarah became the first postmistress of the town and in 1889, one of the largest and finest deposits of onyx was discovered in the town of Mayer. Tragedy struck the town of Mayer in 1890, when heavy rain caused a nearby dam called the \\"Walnut Dam\\" to fail causing a flood which wiped out all of the structures in the town. Mayer began to rebuild the town and in 1897, he built a two-story, 23-room hotel which he named the \\"Mayer Hotel\\". Mayer also raised cattle and sheep. He realized that the establishment of a railroad line in the town would benefit his ranch and the mine near it. He offered the \\"right of way\\" to the Southern Pacific Railroad with the condition that they establish a rail line that ran through the town. The railroad company agreed and began servicing the town of Mayer in 1898. The historic depot was built in 1898 in Mayer, Arizona. The building was purchased by a private citizen who had it hauled to a hill in Phoenix. The owner turned it into part of his home. It is located at 1711 N. 18th Place. Mayer established a brickyard and in 1902, he used his bricks to build a business block, now known as the \\"Mayer Business Block\\", across the street from the Mayer Hotel. The block included a saloon with a dance floor, a barber and bath shop, a mercantile shop and a general store. Later years Mayer provided the money needed to finance the building of two schools. He had one school built within the town and the second one two miles out from the town for the miners' children. Not all of his ventures were successful. One of his failures was the \\"Indian Souvenir Toothpick Company\\". He planned to produce toothpicks from cacti with a new chemical process. However, the cost of removing barbed skin of cactus needles, by the patented chemical process, to make them suitable for toothpicks was too high. Finally, the toothpick company closed because it could not compete with the companies that made standard wooden toothpicks. Mayer learned from a family friend that his mother was in ill-health and that she was dying. He was told by the friend that she wanted to see him before she died. He was also informed that his father and his older brother Gus were dead. Mayer was able to visit his mother and brother Anthony in New York shortly before she died. On November 28, 1909, Mayor heard a noise outside his house and, believing that there was an animal or thief, he took his rifle and ran outside. He tripped as he ran and accidentally shot himself. The wounds which he received were fatal and he died soon after. His funeral was held in the Sacred Heart Church of Prescott. Mayer was buried in Mountain View Cemetery located at 1051 Willow Creek Rd. in Prescott.

VRAINS. Characters Main Characters ; / : :He’s the main protagonist of the series; he is a calm and intelligent 16-year-old high school student. He is secretly working as a hacker and prefers not to stand out in his environment or socializing with others for this reason. As Playmaker, he fought against the Knights of Hanoi to uncover the truth of his past. Ten years before the story, he was kidnapped along with five other children, including Jin, Specter, Theodore, and Miyu. He was imprisoned in a room and forced to duel and win to get nourishment. During those times, he was encouraged by Varis who told him to think of three reasons to live, which made Yusaku develop the habit to state three reasons behind his actions in the present day. He was rescued half a year later, but the incident deeply scarred him. Wanting to put his past behind him, Yusaku became determined to uncover the truth behind his kidnapping. He captured Ai at the beginning of the series and held him hostage during his battles against the Hanoi. In the second season, three months after he defeated Varis and saved LINK VRAINS, however, Queen put a bounty on him despite his heroic actions, as Ai returned to his possession despite Yusaku having freed him prior. Learning that Jin's stolen consciousness was connected to the destruction of Cyberse World, Yusaku became determined to stop the war between humanity and the Ignis; teaming up with Akira Zaizen, Skye, Emma, and the Hanoi. He defeated Bohman and saved humanity, plus everyone was revived. SOL Technologies removed the bounty on him after Ai defeated Queen, he unwillingly fought against his own ally Ai to save SOL Technologies. After he defeated Ai, he went to on a journey in the Network. Why Playmaker went on a journey and what it was for wasn’t made clear. :He uses a Cyberse Deck that focuses on Link Summoning with his ace monsters being Decode Talker and Firewall Dragon; he once used a Warrior Deck before obtaining his Cyberse Deck. In Season 2, he mastered Ritual, Fusion, Synchro and Xyz Summoning with Cyberse Magician, Cyberse Clock Dragon, Cyberse Quantum Dragon, and Firewall eXceed Dragon. He evolved his Firewall Dragon into Link-5 Firewall Dragon Darkfluid. Yusaku’s skill is Storm Access, when his life points are 1,000 or lower, Yusaku can add 1 random Link Monster from a Data Storm to his extra deck. In season 2 Ai created a new Skill called Neo Storm Access. Just like Storm Access, Yusaku has to have 1,000 life points or lower, but now, he can add any random monster from the Data Storm to his extra deck, not just Link Monsters. Another feature of Neo Storm Access, is that if Yusaku didn’t add a monster from the Data Storm to hi extra deck, if he has 100 life points or less he can add any random monster from the Data Storm to his extra deck and then he can draw 1 card. When Ai became the main antagonist for season 3, it was unknown if Yusaku lost the ability to use Neo Storm Access. ; : :He was a sneaky A.I. program with free will known as an . He was sought by both SOL Technologies and the Knights of Hanoi. Five years before the story, when the Knights of Hanoi nearly destroyed Cyberse, the world he came from, Ai sealed his own world to save it from destruction at the cost of being unable to return to Cyberse. In the process, he was devoured by Cracking Dragon, causing him to lose the majority of his memories. In his escape attempt, Yusaku trapped him inside his Duel Disk to use him as leverage against the Knights of Hanoi. After capturing him, Yusaku names him \\"Ai\\" as a pun on how he was an AI program and how he was an eyeball at the time. It was later revealed that he was actually created ten years ago by Dr. Kogami during the Lost Incident, and that he was based on Yusaku. His story about losing his memories was a lie as to prevent Yusaku questioning him. After Varis was defeated, Ai returned to the Cyberse World, only to find it destroyed, which led him to return to Yusaku's side and once again work alongside Playmaker after learning the destruction of Cyberse World and Jin's stolen consciousness were connected. He freed himself from Playmaker’s Duel Disk and sacrificed himself, but returned thanks to the backup he put in Roboppy. :In Season 3, however, he became the main antagonist, he dueled and won against Queen, and put her in the hospital for Earth's sakes. Since he now has the code key, he now takes control of SOL Technologies. Because of Lightning, he unwillingly turned his back on humanity, dragged Roboppy down with him, and betrayed Playmaker’s faction. He now has a human form and he uses an @Ignister deck, which is modeled after his fallen comrades. After losing Roboppy to Soulburner, he created android copies of himself thanks to the factory own by SOL Technologies, under his control. He enhanced Bohman’s programming and obtained a Link 6 Monster. He was seemingly deleted, but it was revealed that Ai is still alive in the final episode. :In season 3 Ai uses the @Ignister archetype. He tends to summon summon lot’s of monsters through spell cards and monster effects. For spells and traps, he uses the “A.I.” archetype. He usually summons his Link Monsters very quickly. Each @Ignister monster represents him and his fellow Ignis. Doyon @Ignister and Dark Templar @Ignister represents Ai himself. Achichi @Ignister and Fire Phoenix @Ignister represents Flame. Hayari @Ignister and Water Leviathan @Ignister represent Aqua. Doshin @Ignister and Earth Golem @Ignister represents Earth. Bururu @Ignister and Wind Pegasus @Ignister represents Windy. And Pikari @Ignister and Light Dragon @Ignister represents Lighting. Ai’s most powerful card The Arrival @Ignister represents the combined power of all of the Ignis. ; / / / : :She’s one of Yusaku's classmates, and a member of the duel club. As Blue Angel, she was a Celebrity Duelist, and a popular duel idol. While she appears cool on the outside as Blue Angel, her personality drastically changed to be more active. She is the younger step-sister of Akira Zaizen, the head of security of SOL Technologies. As Akira rarely came home from work, Skye became determined to use her career as a Celebrity Duelist to gain recognition from Akira. After being Deleted during a duel with Playmaker, Skye realized how much her step-brother cared for her, and she was torn between following her step-brother's request to never enter LINK VRAINS and her own wish to continue duel.

It was released on October 31, 2016 for Microsoft Windows through Steam. The game received positive reviews. Gameplay Creepy Castle is a side-scrolling role-playing game where the player controls Moth, an anthropomorphic insect adventurer. The game is composed of a number of separate story campaigns, each of which spans multiple hours and has unique content and gameplay mechanics. Visually, Creepy Castle resembles both NES games and earlier Atari titles. A number of built-in filters are included, allowing the game to appear as if it is running on a Game Boy or a CRT television among others. Mechanically, Creepy Castle sees the player navigating a large, multi-layered complex while collecting healing items and defeating enemies. Some areas of the map require special items to traverse, giving the game a key Metroidvania quality. Combat is turn-based and is accomplished through a number of different minigames that require the player to constantly adapt to new rule sets. Development Development of Creepy Castle was financed through a crowdfunding campaign on the website Kickstarter. The campaign was launched on September 4, 2014 with a goal of US$6,000; it ended on October 4, 2014, with US$8,485 raised by 271 people (141.42% of the original goal). Critical reception Creepy Castle was met with positive reception. The album received an average score of 82/100 from 6 reviews on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In a more lukewarm review, Jordan Helm of Hardcore Gamer wrote, \\"Though not quite matching the Everest-high peak of its contemporaries, Creepy Castle delivers enough charm and quirkiness to leave a satisfying impression.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2016 video games Category:Windows games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Indie video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Adventure games ","title":"Creepy Castle"},{"id":"56150748","text":"Kent Perkins (born November 19, 1994) is an American football offensive tackle who is a free agent.

It is located in the village of Gjerstad. It is the main church for the Gjerstad parish which is part of the Aust-Nedenes prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden church was built in a \\"long church\\" style in 1848 by Lars Listøl using plans by the architect Christian H. Grosch. The church seats about 500 people. In 2004, the church was renovated and restored to its original look. History In the 1430s, a church named Gerikstadir Kirkje is mentioned in existing historical records. This is the first known reference to a church in Gjerstad. Historically, the parish of Gjerstad included the nearby areas of Vegårshei and Søndeled (which also included Risør. The parish was based in Søndeled from the 1100s until the 1400s when the headquarters of the parish was moved to Gjerstad. In 1745, Søndeled and Risør were separated to form their own parish. The first church built in Gjerstad was likely around the year 1300, probably in the Mostad area, north of the present location. It is not known how long that church stood. In 1737, however, the existing church at that time was torn down and replaced by a new church building in the present- day village of Gjerstad, just north of the shores of the lake Gjerstadvatnet. By the mid-1800s, the municipal council looked at the fact that there were over 2000 residents in the parish and seats for only 389 people in the church, it was far too small. They wanted to nearby double the size of the church, so after standing for nearly 150 years, plans were begun to replace the building. The present church was constructed from 1846–1849, just north of the site of the old church. The new church was consecrate on 23 January 1848 by the Bishop Jacob von der Lippe. After the completion of the new church, the old church (located just down the hill from the new church) was torn down in the summer of 1849 and its material was sold. The cemetery south of the present church is where the old church was located. Priests There have been many priests who served at this church over the years.

It is the third book in the series after John Dies at the End and This Book Is Full of Spiders. The novel continues to follow author surrogate David Wong, his best friend John and his girlfriend Amy, who are living in an American Midwest town, the name of which is Undisclosed. The town has long been a place from which eldritch creatures enter our world from other realities and dimensions, viewing humans as useful cattle at best and disgusting insects at worst. Dave and John have the ability to see these creatures, invisible to regular humans, after encountering a substance known as the \\"Soy Sauce\\" several years ago, as depicted in John Dies at the End. This has led to them becoming semi-experts on dealing with the supernatural among both police and the general populace, over the years gaining fame in certain circles, despite both struggling to maintain financial stability. Synopsis One night, John and Dave are called to investigate a closed room disappearance of a little girl named Maggie Knoll. After questioning her father Ted and following up on the leads, John and Dave quickly establish that the abductor is a supernatural entity that can present itself in different forms, even to people in the same room. As they continue their investigation by questioning Maggie's mother Loretta, Dave's girlfriend Amy is confronted with a doppelgänger of Dave, who leads her to the girl's location under a pond near a collapsed mining shaft. As the girl is reunited with her parents, she identifies Dave as her kidnapper, but Dave and John manage to convince Ted and Loretta that this is another trick of the supernatural kidnapper. John, Dave and Amy find and trap a small insect-like creature that can disguise itself as any living or inanimate object, inserting retroactive memories of its new form so that it doesn't arouse suspicion. Before they can investigate it, another child goes missing under similar circumstances, whose mother Chastity Payton believes it to be related to BATMANTIS???, a large flying creature spotted and filmed in the area. Police detective Bowman arrives to question David on Maggie Knoll's case and finds the second child unconscious in his house, after which he arrests all three of them. The cops take Amy, Dave and John to NON, a government organization with some degree of control over time, alternate dimensions and even death, who question them on the situation. Before NON can wipe their memories, Dave, John and Amy are rescued by Chastity Payton, who takes them to a motel where she is staying with her son. Chastity explains that her memories are full of plot holes and that she was able to pierce the truth: she never had a son before last night, her memories of him were implanted, but were imperfect and didn't take. Exposed, the swarm of creatures switches to another disguise, prompting the group to flee from an armed biker gang. Dave and John take the Soy Sauce to get to the bottom of the mystery and awaken two days later with no memory of what happened. They discover that they have made significant preparations and left themselves written messages, but continuously proceed to miss them until it's too late and accidentally release the BATMANTIS??? creature from her confinement. Amy explains that the biker gang became convinced that ten more of their kids have gone missing, and that she has been working with NON to solve the case. Still experiencing lingering effects from the Soy Sauce, Dave and John are now able to see through the illusions, revealing that all documents on the \\"kids\\" are in fact blank and that \\"Maggie\\" is actually a giant larva literally feeding on Loretta Knoll, who does not experience a thing. Dr. Albert Marconi, a long-time associate of Dave and John with deep knowledge of the occult, arrives to [Undisclosed] after Dave and John mailed him their captured specimen while on the Soy Sauce. Marconi theorizes that the smaller creatures creating false memories are worker drones that allow the larvae to feed on the \\"parent\\" hosts before they hatch into the Queens, one of which is already living under the pond where the first \\"child\\" was found. Marconi designs a method to counteract the illusion, allowing them to capture the second larva and take it to NON, who already have \\"Maggie\\" and Loretta in their custody. NON explains that the only reliable way to kill the larvae is with burning sulfur, but when they fire it at the second larva, it begins hatching. Dave and John help NON take it through a portal into a parallel universe and witness as the larva hatches into a towering infernal monstrosity that changes the idyllic world into a hellish dystopia: retroactively, so that it has always been that way. They rush to stop \\"Maggie\\" larva from doing the same, but Ted Knoll and his ex-military friends storm the NON facility and rescue his wife and \\"daughter\\". Ted sends his family to Marconi, while he and his military group join John, Dave and Amy to blow up the pond mine shaft, believing it to be the nest of BATMANTIS??? creature responsible for the kidnappings. Arriving on the site, Dave and John see that the pond is actually an orifice of the giant creature, but are unable to prevent a group of divers from rescuing ten more \\"children\\" from it and reuniting them with their biker \\"parents\\". They plant the sulfur bomb provided by NON, but Marconi arrives and urges them to remove and disarm it: the known vulnerability was another implanted memory, and the burning sulfur is actually required for the larvae to hatch. Unaware of this, NON arrives on the cite and tries to shoot \\"children\\" with sulfur pellets. Ted Knoll's armed group joins the bikers in protecting the \\"children\\", and a three-way chase occurs, ending at a collapsed bridge. The BATMANTIS??? creature shows up and distracts NON, and Ted Knoll sacrifices himself to kill it, while the bikers take their \\"children\\" away. Several days pass, and Marconi theorizes that, unable to go through metamorphosis, the larvae will eventually die just like unhatched eggs. With this new information, NON continues to keep track on all 11 \\"children\\" and seals the \\"pond\\" to prevent any more from being spewed forth. Detective Bowman visits the group, demanding to know the truth of what really happened, and Dave, Amy and John tell him the story. Bowman notices that Marconi's version of events make much more sense and accuses them of covering something up, before claiming to have video evidence of David turning into BATMANTIS???. With Amy and John in stunned silence, Dave claims that the video is a fake, and Bowman notes that Dave didn't even ask to see it or dismiss the idea that it could exist. Bowman then drives away, having learned everything he needed to know.  Characters  * David Wong: Author surrogate who narrates his segments from the first-person perspective. Several times during the book it is hinted that Dave is not quite human; he was in fact killed and replaced with an identical doppelgänger with the same set of memories during the events of John Dies at the End, of which only he, John and Amy are aware. Since the events of This Book Is Full of Spiders David had lost his job in a video rental store and has no steady source of income, living with his girlfriend Amy in an apartment over a sex shop. His living quarters contain a large number of \\"weird\\" items that his online fans keep sending him: either objects with clear supernatural properties or mundane items that have originated in an alternate timeline. David's self-destructing tendencies are troubling Amy, and at the end of the book, she and John convince him to pull his life together. * Amy Sullivan: David's girlfriend whose narration is in third person and lacks the profanity of Dave and John's perspective. Amy is missing her left hand that was lost in a car accident and is working in a call center for a home security company, which makes her a suspect in the disappearances that seemed to involve disabling of intruder alarms. Unlike Dave and John, Amy never had any contact with the Soy Sauce and continues to view the monstrous larvae as human children even after the truth is explained to her, insisting on saving them even in the direst of circumstances. As part of the mind games played by the creatures, Amy is visited by a perfect version of David, who admits to all of his faults in their relationship and sets on improving them, only to reveal himself to be not real and tell Amy that she deserves better. This encounter and the following experiences cause Amy to reach out to David, urging him to take control of his life. * John: Based on the author's friend John Cheese, John is a long-time close and currently only friend of David. John's third- person narration is extremely unreliable and features him performing feats of incredible badassery and displaying amazing sexual prowess which Dave and Amy have learned to filter out by now. Despite him being in late twenties, John's behaviour is incredibly juvenile and includes thrill-seeking in the face of a supernatural threat, calling David in early morning hours with trivial \\"emergencies\\" and casual frivolity that results in him being charged with public indecency. Unlike David, who only deals with supernatural out of necessity and is happy to ignore everything that does not present a direct threat, John is extremely enthusiastic about the phenomena they encounter and insists on cataloging them, despite continuously giving them impractical names such as \\"fuckroach\\" or \\"screaming clown dick\\". While under effect of the Soy Sauce, John gains the ability to control a swarm of creatures that implant false memories, causing them to manifest in the form of Korean adult film actress Joy Park, gaining her mannerisms and assisting the group against the larger threat. \\"Joy\\" then decides to stay with John, acting like a stereotypical girlfriend much to his annoyance. * Doctor Albert Marconi: A former priest who assisted Dave and John on several previous occasions. Despite his reality television personality, Marconi has a deep understanding of the supernatural and is among the most knowledgeable about the true nature of the universe. He is able to deduce the creatures' powers, role and origin from a single specimen send to him and quickly devises a successful test that can disrupt their supernatural disguises. However, because he is unable to see the larvae's true form, Marconi requires David's assistance when he needs to operate on one of them. Excerpts from one of Marconi's fictional books \\"Fear: Hell's Paradise\\" are interspersed throughout the novel. * Agent Helen Tasker/Emily Wyatt/Josaline Pussnado: A high-ranking NON agent. When she introduces herself to Dave, Amy and John, all three hear different names, which they continue to use throughout their respective narrations. She suffers several mortal wounds during the events of the novel, including a decapitation, but always reappears alive and whole later. From Dave and John's previous escapades in [Undisclosed] she is aware that if NON tried to hurt them, a supernatural harm would come their way instead, which is why she does her best to cooperate with them and Amy. * Ted Knoll: Former special forces member and ex-husband of Loretta Knoll. He quickly deduces that the disappearance of his daughter does not fit parameters of a regular crime, which is why he calls for Dave and John instead of the police, and is quick to accept the existence of the supernatural, with his military mind processing it as merely a new kind of threat. After \\"Maggie\\" is returned to him, he initially blames David for her kidnapping, until Dave and John convince him to direct his anger towards the real threat, unable to tell him that his \\"daughter\\" is part of it. * Loretta Knoll: Ted's ex-wife. When \\"Maggie\\" is returned to her, she begins literally feeding on Loretta, taking one bite with her mandibles after another. By the time Dave and John visit her again, large chunks of Loretta's body are missing and many of her organs are exposed, but just like everybody else Loretta herself doesn't seem to feel a thing out of the ordinary. * Chastity Payton: A single woman living in a trailer park, and the first one to piece together that the kidnappings weren't merely caused by shapeshifters, but the entire existence of the missing \\"children\\" was just implanted memories designed to make their \\"parents\\" rescue them from the \\"pond\\". She leaves the narrative after skipping town, determined to get as far away from it as possible. * Detective Bowman: A policeman who encounters John and David on several occasions. At the end of the book, he accuses them and Amy of fabricating the entire story to cover up for the fact that David was in fact the BATMANTIS??? creature the entire time. Reception John Valeri of Criminal Element gave the book a positive review, saying that it \\"transcends the gags, the gore, the gadgets, and the gratuity... to tell a story of survival that, despite its many absurdities, is one we’re all living.\\" Maddie Crum of The Washington Post gave a semi-positive review, noting that \\"the brisk story is too often stalled by crass bits\\" and that issues such as class anxiety are brought up, but remain unexplored.

The following year he was named to the Helms Athletic Foundation Hall of Fame. He was the first small-college coach to be honored by either group.

He is the CEO and co-founder of Arktos Media, and co-founder of the AltRight Corporation in partnership with American white supremacist Richard Spencer. He is also the European editor of the corporation's website AltRight.com. At the head of an international far-right media, literature, and music empire, Friberg is influenced in particular by the 'metapolitical' strategy of the French Nouvelle Droite ('New Right'), defined by Guillaume Faye as the \\"social diffusion of ideas and cultural values for the sake of provoking profound, long-term, political transformation.\\" Scholar Benjamin R. Teitelbaum has described Arktos Media as the \\"uncontested global leader in the publication of English-language Nouvelle Droite literature.\\"  Biography   Early life  Daniel Friberg was born in 1978 in Gothenburg, from an educated and politically left-leaning family. According to him, he was drawn to right-wing views after witnessing immigrant children targeting whites in his school. In his teenage years he became involved with the Swedish white power skinhead culture of the 1990s. In middle school, he handed out leaflets for the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, and soon began printing his own propaganda with a printer laser to post it in his school. In 1997, aged 19, he founded the agency Alternative Media and the newspaper Framtid (Future) in order to propagate his nationalist ideas in the Swedish society at large. Friberg spent his entire savings to print 21,000 copies and send them to every graduating high-school students of Stockholm and Gothenburg. In 1998, he joined the editorial staff of Folktribunen, the main outlet of the Swedish Resistance Movement, today the largest militant Nazi organization in Scandinavia. He eventually left the movement after it was radicalized, and started to distance himself from the white supremacist culture.  Media activities  Friberg cofounded in 2001 Nordic Press (Nordiska förlaget), a publishing and music distribution company that primarily sold albums performed by white power bands, with the aim of providing nationalists a new \\"education\\" and \\"inspiration\\". His agency, Alternative Media, produced a three-CD project named Svensk ungdom (Swedish Youth). The first release in the series remains one of the most popular nationalist albums in the Nordic countries today. In parallel, Nordic Press turned into the first major source of anti-immigrant literature in nationalist circles and helped them display a 'semi-academic character'. From 2004, Friberg became inspired by the Nouvelle Droite (French New Right) literature, especially the works of Alain de Benoist and Guillaume Faye, \\"It was this translation of the Nouvelle Droite manifesto that I read (...) online, written in English. (...) Thought it was totally brilliant, and wondered why these ideas weren’t better known.\\" The same year, he cofounded the Nordic League (Nordiska förbundet), an organization advocating a ostensibly metapolitical stance that echoed the ideas of the Nouvelle Droite. Along with other leaders of the Nordic League, he co-established in July 2006 the Swedish-language blog portal Motpol and, the same year, the far-right online collaborative encyclopedia Metapedia, portrayed as an effort to advance the \\"cultural war\\". He was also closely involved in the creation of the messaging board Nordisk.ru, which attracted some 22,000 Scandinavian nationalists and other far-right users, including Anders Breivik.  Arktos Media  Friberg earned an MBA from Gothenburg University in 2006. He worked in finance and management, then served as the CEO of Wiking Mineral until 2016, a mining company that includes other executives associated with the far- right, most notably Patrik Brinkmann. In 2009, Friberg became the sole owner of the Nordic League and decided to cease the activities of the organization while allowing Metapedia and Motpol to continue to operate. In October, he planned with a Danish politician and two Danish collaborators the creation of the publishing house Arktos media, officially established the following year in 2010. Friberg became the CEO of the company, and American John B. Morgan its chief editor. Arktos Media has translated to English and published various far-right authors such as Julius Evola, Alain de Benoist, Guillaume Faye, Alexandr Dugin and Paul Gottfried. During the 2010s, it had grown as the largest retailer of radical Right literature in the world according to scholar Benjamin R. Teitelbaum. American white supremacist Richard Spencer has also credited Arktos with having increased access to European New Right and Identitatian literature among American white nationalists. In early 2015, Friberg co-founded the online media outlet RightOn.net, and he published his first book, The Real Right Returns (Högern kommer tillbaka), where he contended that it was the right time for nationalists to enter the public sphere without fear of massive political repression. In January 2017, he partnered with Spencer and the Swedish white nationalist website Red Ice to establish the Alt-Right Corporation and the website AltRight.com, seen as a major effort to unite European and U.S. white-identity figures. Friberg was a scheduled speaker at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Virginia, which broke out in violence and lead to the deaths of one counter-protester and two law enforcement officers. Friberg blamed the violence on antifa counter-protesters and police.  Views  Friberg's beliefs include identitarianism, which opposes multiculturalism and migration, and ethnopluralism. His 2015 book, The Real Right Returns: A Handbook for the True Opposition, has been described as Friberg's \\"manifesto, and a handbook for alt-right activists\\".  Private life  Since 2014, Friberg has lived in Budapest, Hungary. He has spent time in prison for weapons and other offences from 1995 to 2010.

It is the 29th overall episode of the series and is written by Nic Van Zeebroeck and Michael Sopczynski and directed by Félix Alcalá. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on November 8, 2012. Plot Reese (Jim Caviezel) ventures into suburbia to locate the next person of interest, Graham Wyler (David Denman), a seemingly normal family man and hardware store owner, except Finch (Michael Emerson) discovers that Wyler has been dead for 15 years, meaning they are dealing with an impostor who stole Wylers name. Unable to do his usual routine, Reese \\"proposes\\" to Zoe Morgan (Paige Turco) for the mission to help blend into suburban life. They move to the suburbs to investigate Wyler, who Reese observes having interactions with men who seemingly recognise him. Obtaining his prints, Carter identifies him as Lloyd Pruitt, a master safecracker and career criminal wanted for a string of armed robberies. On his last job, one of his partners killed an unarmed guard and while the crew went to prison, Lloyd created a new life for himself as Wyler. His former partners are out of prison and are terrorizing him to force him out of hiding. Wyler is forced to help with a robbery led by his former partners. He cracks the safe as Reese and the NYPD show up. Carter (Taraji P. Henson) buys some extra time with the police by leading them up the wrong staircase to give Reese and Wyler time to escape down the other; however, Wyler decides he does not want to run any more and turns himself in. He turns state's evidence against the gang and is then placed on house arrest, as the court deems him no threat to society and due to his help in getting convictions on the crew. Zoe and John \\"divorce\\" but Zoe suggests they both spend one more night in 'their' house. The episode ends with a flashback of Finch (Michael Emerson) greeting Grace (Carrie Preston) (who would later be his fiancé) for the first time. Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"The High Road\\" was seen by an estimated 14.87 million household viewers and gained a 2.9/8 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 9% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 13.66 million viewers with a 2.9/7 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night, beating Elementary but behind Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind The Voice, Grey's Anatomy, Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory. With Live +7 DVR factored in, the episode was watched by 18.11 million viewers with a 3.9 in the 18-49 demographics. Critical reviews \\"The High Road\\" received positive reviews from critics. Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"Of all Person Of Interests rapidly expanding cast of recurring characters, Zoe is the one who's most likely to be pulled into a story from out of the blue, and also the one most likely to leave you wanting more.

The grave was discovered by a research team sponsored by the University of Cincinnati and led by husband- and-wife archaeologists Jack L. Davis and Sharon Stocker. The tomb site was excavated from May to October 2015. During the initial six month excavation, the research team uncovered an intact adult male skeleton and excavated 1400 objects including weapons, jewels, armour and silver and gold artifacts. Since 2015, the number of artifacts recovered from the grave has reached over 3500 items, including a historically significant Minoan sealstone called the Pylos Combat Agate and four signet gold rings with detailed images from Minoan mythology.  Background  The \\"most completely preserved of all Bronze Age palaces on the Greek mainland\\" is the so-called \\"Palace of Nestor\\", located near the city of Pylos. In 1939, archaeologist Carl Blegen, a professor of classical archaeology at the University of Cincinnati, with the cooperation of Greek archaeologist Konstantinos Kourouniotis, led an excavation to locate the palace of the famous king of Homer's Iliad. Blegen selected a hilltop site in Messenia, called Epano Englianos, as a possible location of the ancient ruins. The excavation uncovered the remains of a number of structures, tombs and the first examples of Greek writing in Linear B. The excavation continued from 1952 to 1966, with Blegen retiring in 1957. With questions still to be answered about the Mycenaean civilization prior to the 13th century BC, the University of Cincinnati renewed excavations at the \\"Palace of Nestor\\" in 2015, with the support of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the permission of the Greek Ministry of Culture. Blegen's work at Pylos is continued by Davis and Stocker, who have both worked in this area of Greece for the past 25 years.  Initial excavation  The gravesite was discovered in an olive grove near the ancient Palace of Nestor, within the Bronze Age city of Pylos, in southwest Greece. The excavation leaders, Davis and Stocker, had originally planned to excavate downhill from the Palace. Due to local bureaucracy issues and an unforeseen strike, they were unable to get a permit for their desired site and were instead only given permission to dig in a neighboring olive grove. A few spots in the olive grove were chosen for investigation, including \\"three stones that appeared to form a corner\\". On May 28, 2015, as two members of the research team started to dig, a two meter by one meter shaft revealed itself, suggesting a grave. Researchers discovered a skeleton at the bottom of the grave surrounded by various artifacts. The remains were found in a wooden coffin placed within a stone lined chamber. Items determined to be grave offerings were found inside and on top of the coffin and in the stone lined shaft. The finds consisted of jewelry, sealstones, carved ivories, combs, gold and silver goblets, and bronze weapons.  Identifying the Griffin Warrior  \\"Analyses of the skeleton show that this 30-something dignitary stood around 5ft. Combs found in the grave imply that he had long hair. A recent computerized facial reconstruction based on the warrior's skull, created by Lynne Schepartz and Tobias Houlton, physical anthropologists at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, shows a broad, determined face with close-set eyes and a prominent jaw.\\" \\"So far we have no idea of the identity of this man,\\" said Stocker — other than he was someone very important and very rich. His bones showed he had been of a robust stature — which, along with martial objects found in the grave, suggested he was a warrior — although he could also have been a priest, as many of the objects found with him had ritual significance.\\" Further analysis of the skeleton will enable researchers to learn more about the identity of the male skeleton. Scientific examination of his well- preserved teeth and pelvic bones may help determine his genetic background, diet and cause of death.  Tomb artifacts  * A gold box-weave chain with \\"sacral ivy\\" finials. * A meter-long sword with a gold-coated hilt. * A gold- hilted dagger. * Multiple gold and silver cups. * Carnelian, amethyst, amber, and gold beads. * Four gold rings. * Dozens of small, carved seals with etched depictions of combat, goddesses, reeds, altars, lions, and men jumping over bulls. * A plaque of ivory with a representation of a griffon in a rocky landscape. * A bronze mirror with an ivory handle. * Thin bands of bronze (remains of the warrior's armor). * Boar tusks, possibly from the warrior's helmet. * A knife with a large, square blade. * Two squashed gold cups, and a silver cup with a gold rim. * Six silver cups. * Bronze cups, bowls, amphora, jugs, and a basin, some trimmed with gold, some with silver trim. * Six decorated ivory combs.  Further excavation and analysis  Initially, the research team found it difficult to determine the date of burial of the tomb's inhabitant. Pottery remnants are typically used for dating purposes, but the warrior's grave contained no pottery. In the summer of 2016, further excavations in the area surrounding the gravesite unearthed pottery fragments that enabled Davis and Stocker to date the site to 1500–1450 BC. With that information, they were able to determine that the warrior lived during the end of the shaft grave period before the construction of the palatial centres in Mycenaean Greece, including the Palace of Nestor. Researchers are currently studying the artifacts in detail, with all excavation objects remaining in Greece and their final placement to be determined by the Greek Archaeological Service. Former University of Cincinnati anthropologist Lynne Schepartz, now of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, is studying the skeletal remains. DNA tests and isotope analyses are also underway in the hope of learning more about the warrior's ethnic and geographic origins.  Gold signet rings  Four gold signet rings unveiled in late 2016 are engraved with intricate Minoan images and clearly indicate significant Mycenaean-Minoan cultural transfer in this era.  Pylos Combat Agate  Among the various tomb artifacts found, a small item in length, and embedded in limestone was revealed after a year of cleaning to be a beautifully carved sealstone. The sealstone's image, an intricately carved combat scene can only be viewed in full detail with a photomicroscopy camera lens. \\"A magnifying glass may have been used to create the details on the stone\\", according to Stocker, but \\"no type of magnifying tool from this time period has ever been found.\\"  Interpretations  \\"'Probably not since the 1950s have we found such a rich tomb,\\" said James C. Wright, the director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The grave, in Dr. Wright's view, lies \\"at the date at the heart of the relationship of the mainland culture to the higher culture of Crete\\" and will help scholars understand how the state cultures that developed in Crete were adopted into what became the Mycenaean palace culture on the mainland. \\"The palaces found at Mycene, Pylos and elsewhere on the Greek mainland have a common inspiration: All borrowed heavily from the Minoan civilization that arose on the large island of Crete, southeast of Pylos. The Minoans were culturally dominant to the Mycenaeans but were later overrun by them. How, then, did Minoan culture pass to the Mycenaeans? The warrior's grave may hold many answers. He died before the palaces began to be built, and his grave is full of artifacts made in Crete. 'This is a transformative moment in the Bronze Age,\\" said Dr. Brogan, the director of the Institute for Aegean Prehistory Study Center for East Crete.'\\" Davis and Stocker believe that the artifacts uncovered in 2015 in the 3,500-year-old grave \\"were symbols of his power as a ruler of the town of Pylos\\", located on the southwestern coast of Greece. \\"Whoever they are, they are the people introducing Minoan ways to the mainland and forging Mycenaean culture,\\" Davis said.

Distribution It occurs in Thailand in Sa Kaeo Province and in Chiang Mai Province. Ecology Moungsrimuangdee et al. include it as a riparian species in their study of the flora along the Phra Prong River in Watthana Nakhon District in Thailand, where it flowers in June. In mixed deciduous forest of Laos, the shrub becomes more common after logging, and to a lesser extent after shifting cultivation. On the islands of the Mekong River between Kratié and Steung Treng in northern Cambodia the plant is moderately abundant. It grows as a \\"wickedly spiny\\" climber/liana in the prevalent bamboo and deciduous seasonal hardwood forest, and in degraded areas, secondary growth and deciduous dipterocarp forest. There it flowers in April and May, fruits from October to December, and has leaves between May and December. The fruits are harvested. Uses The wood is used to make charcoal in Cambodia, and a decoction of the bark is used in traditional medicine to treat ovarian diseases and yeast infections. Villagers living on the plateau of Phnom Kulen National Park, in Svay Leu District, Siem Reap Province, northwestern Cambodia, use parts of the shrub in their traditional medicinal practices. The wood chips are decocted alone to treat stomach ache, they are also combined with the vine Willughbeia edulis and wood chips from Cananga latifolia in a decoction to treat stomach ache, circulation problems and/or to increase appetite. In order to help in pregnancy, a decoction of Z. cambodiana bark and a unidentified vine known as trolaing piən is drunk. Among Kuy- and Khmer- speaking people living in the same villages in Stung Treng and Preah Vihear provinces of north-central Cambodia, the plant is also used as a source of medicine, as well as for unspecified other uses. The Bunong people of Mondulkiri Province, northeastern Cambodia, have a number of traditional medicinal practices that involve the shrub. The fruits are eaten or are decocted and drunk alone or in a mixture with bark, root and wood of Cananga latifolia, whole plant of Hydnophytum formicarum, roots from various Leea species and Uraria crinita or U. lagopodiodes and bark of Vachellia harmandiana to treat stomach ache. To treat diarrhoea, a decoction of bark, fruit and wood of Z. cambodiana is drunk. The leaves and wood of this plant together with those of Taxillus chinensis are decocted and drunk to treat cough. Leucorrhoea is treated with a decocted mix of the bark and wood of Amphineurion marginatum, Cananga latifolia, Harrisonia perforata, Polyalthia cerasoides, Uvaria rufa, Z cambodiana, and Ziziphus oenoplia, the leaves and wood (?) of Hoya kerrii and roots of Leea species and Oroxylum indicum. A decoction of the roots of Z. cambodiana is drunk to treat food intolerance after having given birth. In northern Thailand, the plant has been among those identified as being used by Karen people of Chiang Mai Province to treat gastric ulcers.

Bangladesh and Egypt enjoy friendly relations. Egypt has a resident ambassador, Mahmoud Ezzat, in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Bangladesh maintains a resident ambassador in Egypt. History Ancient The Mamluk sultan Barsbay had good ties with other Muslim rulers of his time, in particular Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, the Sultan of Bengal. According to Al-Sakhawi's Al- Daw al-lami\` li ahli al-Qarni al-Tasi, the Mamluk sultan once gifted the Bengali sultan with investiture, a robe of honour and a letter of recognition. The Bengali ruler had died before his gifts could be dispatched to Barsbay. His son and successor, Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah, had slightly delayed the dispatching but nevertheless sending the initial gifts of his father off whilst also adding more gifts of his own. In total, the package was worth over 12,000 red tankas and included clothes, cotton, ginger, myrobalan and other spices. The envoy, travelling from Bengal to Cairo via the Indian Ocean, sank whilst at Jeddah's coast. In 1436, the Governor of Jeddah sent some men to search the Red Sea for the gifts and they came back with the textiles although the spices were damaged by the water. After Barsbay was informed of this by the governor, he ordered for the arrest of all members of the Bengali embassy, the confiscation of their envoy's merchandise, and banned them from ever travelling to Cairo again. Modern Bangladesh sent medical teams and supplies to Egypt for the Yom Kippur War. In 1974 Egypt led by President Anwar Sadat donated 44 tanks to Bangladesh which was led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. These were the first tanks received by the Bangladesh Army after Bangladesh became an independent country in 1971. These same tanks were used in the Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Bangladesh and Egypt are both members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Islamic Military Coalition. Economic relations Both Egypt and Bangladesh are members of the Developing-8. Bangladesh imports cotton from Egypt for its Ready-made garment industry. In 2005 Egyptian telecommunication company Orascom acquired Sheba Telecom the holding company of cellular company Banglalink. In 2013 there were 15 thousand Bangladeshis in Egypt according to the Bangladeshi embassy in Egypt.

It has a circumference of , a diameter of , and an electron energy of 3 GeV. The produced synchrotron radiation covers the range of infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray light. Costing R$1.8 billion, it was funded by the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication (Brazil) and the São Paulo Research Foundation. Discussion started in 2008, and initial funding of R$2 million was granted in 2009. Construction started in 2015, and is due to open in 2018. With its construction near the end, Sirius will be the second particle accelerator in Brazil, next to the UVX, also operator by the LNLS. Brazil and Argentina are the only countries in South America to operate particle accelerators. Main Entrance. Characteristics The tool will be used to understand the atomic structure of substances with which scientists are going to work, which can help in the development of new drugs, in the enhancement of materials used in construction, oil exploration and in many other areas. The 68,000-square-meter building will house a ring-shaped, circumferential 500-meter facility. To protect people from the radiation released by machine operation, designed to be the most advanced of its kind in the world, the whole will be shielded by 1 kilometer of concrete walls. A barrier of 1.5 meters thick and 3 meters high. The investment in the project is R$1.8 billion, the most ambitious scientific project ever made in Brazil. It is expected to be completed by 2018 and operating by 2019, although its project is expected to be fulfilled in 2020. According to project scientists, Sirius will have the ability to project matter under pressure equivalent to that of the planet's Jupiter nucleus, being the first particle accelerator with such capacity (it is currently able to simulate the Earth's core pressure)  References   External links  * Category:Synchrotron radiation facilities Category:Science and technology in Brazil ","title":"Sirius (synchrotron light source)"},{"id":"56151617","text":"Noviherbaspirillum canariense is a Gram-negative bacterium which was isolated from old volcanic mountain soil on Tenerife on the Canary Islands.

During the First World War the hospital moved to Paris, where a 1,800-bed hospital was set up to deal with war casualties. History The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, during World War I. At Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, the American military set up a Medical Officers Training Camp (MOTC) called Camp Greenleaf. Authorized in May 1917 until it was decommissioned in December 1918, the camp trained 6,640 officers and 31,138 enlisted men. Among some units were the doctors and staff of Base Hospital No. 57. The members of the hospital were organized on April 2, 1918. Most of the men were drafted from Oil City, Pennsylvania. After training they shipped to Camp Merritt, New Jersey where they embarked on the Madingo on July 31, 1918. After stopping briefly in England they boarded the Londonderry and landed in France on August 21, 1918. They moved around France until on September 16, 1918 it was ordered to Paris where they took over 1,800 beds in a large school building in Paris. During the offensives of 1918, the hospital had as many as 2,000 patients. From taking over the Paris school in September 1918 to when the unit left France on August 13, 1919, the hospital unit treated 8,505 surgical and medical cases, and 7,292 dental cases. Of the nineteen members of the Siamese Expeditionary Forces who lost their lives during their WWI deployment, eleven died in hospitals. In February 1919 five of these hospital-bound Thai soldiers died at the American Base Hospital No. 57 in Paris. The unit returned to America on August 22, 1919, aboard the Kaiserin Augusta Victoria, and was demobilized soon after.

It was founded by a number of people who were previously members of Kew Hebrew Congregation. Overview Ark Centre opened in 2008 operating from a hall in Bialik College, under the leadership of Yoram Symons and later Rabbi Yaron Gottlieb who had the role as the synagogue's Magid. Under the stewardship of Symons and then Rabbi Shneur Reti- Waks, they operated out of a hired home in Lovell St, East Hawthorn, before moving into their permanent residence in Cato Street in 2014. Since moving into the Cato Street premises the suite of offerings provided has grown. Beyond the ‘traditional’ services of life-cycle events, events associated with religious festivals and holidays and synagogue services, Ark Centre has invested in providing more to the community. The physical premises were designed to be multi-purpose to facilitate usage in a number of ways: celebration of life cycle events, synagogue services, youth programs, yoga and wellbeing activities, conferences, adult and youth programs and much more. Within the premises is a commercial kitchen where kosher catering is available. There are also other services provided by the centre. Under the stewardship of Reti-Waks, the Ark also courted controversy when there were a number of marriages where there were rumours that they did not conform to halachic standards. The matter was resolved between the Rabbincal Council of Victoria and Reti-Waks, when the marriages were all accepted. Reti-Waks on behalf of the Ark has signed letters in support of marriage equality, and against the Australian government's treatment of refugees. In 2019 Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann and Rebbetzin Mushka Kantor Kaltmann assumed the role of Rabbi and Rebbetzin of Ark Centre. Conversions The Ark Centre was one of a number of conversion programs in Victoria, existing as an alternative to the existing Melbourne Beth Din program. The program was run under the auspices of Rabbi Yisrael Rosen, but these conversions were not officially accepted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and did not appear on their list of recognised conversion courts. In trying to deal with this situation, Reti-Waks joined the Rabbinical Council of Victoria, and later the Ark agreed to suspend any conversions for 12 months while the Beth Din determined their legitimacy. Ultimately the conversions were rejected by the Beth Din, even though they did not provide any proof of illegitimacy on the part of the Ark. Ark Centre are currently teaching conversion students, but do not perform the conversions. The centre facilitates the conversions through the Melbourne Beth Din and continues to have a positive relationship with the conversion Beth Din in Alon Shevut.

It services an industrial area in Bayswater and Bassendean, and connects to Tonkin Highway. Route Description Collier Road is a four- lane road for its entire length, with a speed limit of 60 km/h from Walter Road to Grey/Jackson Streets, and 70 km/h from Grey/Jackson Streets to Guildford Road. Collier Road starts at a traffic light controlled t-junction with Walter Road in Morley. From there, it travels southwards, past the Galleria Shopping Centre and other various commercial buildings on the west, and residential housing on the east, bending a little to the east after . After , Crimea Street meets up with Collier Road at an unsignalised t-junction. After another , Collier Road comes to a traffic light controlled intersection with Broun Avenue at the boundary of Morley and Embleton. From there, Collier Road is surrounded by residential houses in Embleton. After , the road bends a bit more, so now it is travelling eastwards. After of straight road, there is a traffic light controlled intersection on the boundary of Embleton and Bayswater with Beechboro Road South on the south, and Embleton Avenue on the north. From there, Collier Road is surrounded on both sides by industrial buildings. After , Collier Road comes to a Single Point Urban Interchange with Tonkin Highway, with Collier Road going over the top of Tonkin Highway, which is free flowing. later, Collier Road comes to a traffic light controlled intersection on the boundary of Bayswater and Bassendean, as well as the City of Bayswater and the Town of Bassendean with Jackson Street on the south and Grey Street on the north. For , Collier Road bends north, and then south, mostly through an industrial area, but with a small bit of residential on the east, near the end. At the end, Collier Road crosses the Midland railway line before terminating just after at a t-junction with Guildford Road. History Collier Road used to connect through to Wellington Road on its north-western terminus, but during the 1980s, Collier Road was redirected to make room for the Galleria Shopping Centre. Remnants of the old alignment of Collier Road are still there, with a small portion of Collier Road, now named Old Collier Road used as an entrance to the Galleria Shopping Centre. Collier Road was also realigned in Bassendean. It used to travel straight towards Bassendean railway station, before traveling along the north side of the railway, but now it bends towards Guildford Road earlier. Between mid 2016 and early 2018, as part of NorthLink WA, Collier Road was realigned between Wright Street and Grey / Jackson Street. A Single point urban interchange was built at the junction of Collier Road and Tonkin Highway, replacing the previous at-grade intersection. Also, traffic lights were added to Collier Road's junctions with Wright Street and Grey / Jackson Street. The project was needed to make Tonkin Highway freeway standard and to replace the intersection of Collier Road and Tonkin Highway, as it was the third most congested intersection in Western Australia in 2016. Due to Collier Road being realigned, the roads around the area had to be renamed. The City of Bayswater city officers suggested the names Walkenden Road for the bypassed section of Collier Road west of Tonkin Highway, Greenaish Road east of Tonkin Highway, and a small portion of Spencer Street north of Collier Road to Seal Street, but the City of Bayswater knocked back those suggestions at a committee meeting on 20 June 2017. Local businesses on the bypassed section of Collier Road wanted it to keep its current name, and rename the new section of Collier Road, saying that they could lose much money, and that they will have to change many things, such as contracts and banking details. On 14 August 2017, City of Bayswater councillors and staff, Landgate, NorthLink WA, and affected businesses met, and all agreed to keep the name Collier Road for the existing section of road, and naming the new section of road something else. On 22 August 2017, the City of Bayswater council agreed to keep the name Collier Road for the existing section of road, with the new section to be named Collier Link, and the northern part of Spencer Street renamed Seal Street. Future Both Main Roads Western Australia and the Public Transport Authority say that the Collier Road level crossing with the Midland railway line is going to be grade separated, however it is not a priority, because there are more congested level crossings in Perth. There are no plans of how the grade separation will happen, and the government has not allocated any money to it.

The Long Long Holiday (Les Grandes Grandes Vacances) is an animated series broadcast in 2015 on France 3, which tells the story of the occupation of France during the Second World War through children living in Normandy. In September 1939, Colette and Ernest are welcomed by their maternal grandparents in a fictional village named Grangeville, near Dieppe in Normandy. The short vacation becomes semi- permanent when their father goes off to fight, following the mobilization of France to fight the invading German Army, and the poor health of their mother, required to leave to be treated in a sanatorium. The two little Parisians discover life in the countryside during wartime, including occupation, Resistance, deprivation, but also life with friends. The ten episode mini- series (sometimes shown as five episodes, including on Netflix and Prime Video) was created by Emile Bravo (graphic design), Paul Leluc (director), and Delphine Maury (author), and produced by Les Armateurs Cyber Group Studios. Olivier Vinuesa and Alain Serluppus assisted Delphine Maury at the beginning of the writing on the narrative arc, then Guillaume Mautalent and Sébastien Oursel became co-writers on the whole series, along with Timothée de Fombelle, who also lent a hand on the arc of the ten episodes. Syd Matters composed the music for the series.http://www.lesarmateurs-lesite.fr/fiches/38-les-grandes- grandes-vacances.html In 2016 the show won Best Children's TV Program by the Paris Radio and Television Club.

He later spent many years in a debtors' prison. Early life Cuming was born (according to his manuscript autobiography) in Edinburgh on 18 December 1691. He was the only son of Sir Alexander Cuming, M.P. (c.1670–1725), the first baronet of Culter, Aberdeenshire, by his first wife, Elizabeth; she was the second daughter of the second wife of Sir Alexander Swinton, a Scottish judge. (He had several sisters and a half-brother, James Cuming of Breda, by his father's second wife) In 1714 he was called to the Scottish bar, and also held a captain's commission in the Russian army. From his manuscripts, it seems that Cuming was induced to quit the legal profession by a pension of £300 a year being granted to him by the government at Christmas 1718, and that it was discontinued at Christmas 1721 at the instance, he suggests, of Sir Robert Walpole, who bore a grudge against his father for opposing him in parliament. It is more probable that he was found to be of a too flighty disposition to fulfil the services expected of him. Voyage to America; the Cherokee delegation In 1729 Cuming was led, supposedly by a dream of his wife's, to undertake a voyage to America, with the object of visiting the Cherokee mountains on the borders of South Carolina and Virginia. Leaving England on 13 September, he arrived at Charlestown on 5 December, and on 11 March following he began his journey to the Cherokee Indian country. It was on 3 April 1730 that \\"by the unanimous consent of the people he was made lawgiver, commander, leader, and chief of the Cherokee nation, and witness of the power of God, at a general meeting at Nequisee, in the Cherokee mountains\\". Extracts from his journal, giving an account of his transactions with the Indians and his explorations in the Cherokee mountains, were published in the London Daily Journal of 8 October 1730. He returned to Charlestown on 13 April 1730, accompanied by seven chiefs of the Cherokee nation, including Attakullakulla, and on 5 June arrived at Dover in the man-of-war Fox; on 18 April he was allowed to present the chiefs to George II in the royal chapel at Windsor, and four days later laid his crown at the feet of the king, when the chiefs laid also their four scalps to show their superiority over their enemies, and five eagle tails as emblems of victory. The proceedings of the chiefs while in England excited great interest. Shortly before they returned to their country, an \\"Agreement of Peace and Friendship\\", was signed with them on 29 September, in the name of the British nation, and with the approval of the Board of Trade: the Cherokees recognized Britain as a sole trading nation, in return for supplies of guns and gunpowder. This agreement was probably the means of keeping the Cherokees as firm allies of Britain in subsequent wars. By this time some reports seriously affecting Cuming's character had reached England. In a letter from South Carolina, bearing the date 12 June 1730, an extract from which is given in the Edinburgh Weekly Journal for 16 September, he is directly accused of having defrauded the settlers of large sums of money and other property by means of fictitious promissory notes. He does not seem to have made any answer to these charges, which, if true, would explain his subsequent ill-success and poverty. The government turned a deaf ear to all his proposals, which included schemes for paying off eighty millions of the national debt by settling three million Jewish families in the Cherokee mountains to cultivate the land, and for relieving Britain's American colonies from taxation by establishing numerous banks and a local currency. Imprisonment Being now deeply in debt, Cuming turned to alchemy, and attempted experiments on the transmutation of metals. In 1737 he was confined within the limits of the Fleet Prison, but having a rule of court. He remained there until 1765, when, on 30 December of that year, he was nominated a poor brother of the London Charterhouse by Archbishop Secker, and took up residence in the hospital on 3 January 1766. He died there nearly ten years afterwards, and was buried in the church of East Barnet on 28 August 1775. He had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1720, but, neglecting to pay the annual fee, was expelled in 1757. Family Cuming married Amy, daughter of Lancelot Whitehall, a member of an old Shropshire family, and a commissioner in the customs for Scotland. They had a son, Alexander, born about 1737, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who predeceased him. Amy died during Cuming's imprisonment, and was buried in East Barnet on 22 October 1743. Their son, who succeeded to the title, was a captain in the army, but became mentally ill, and died some time before 1796 in poverty, in the neighbourhood of Red Lion Street, Whitechapel.

Since 2015 she has lived in Romania and carried out a public role on behalf of the Romanian royal family.  Early life  Princess Marie (Romanian: Maria) was born on 13 July 1964 at Copenhagen University Hospital Gentofte in Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark as the youngest of five daughters of King Michael I and Queen Anne. Maria was born while her father was in the United States on business for the New York Stock Exchange. King Michael was informed by telephone that he'd become a father for the fifth time. Maria was baptised in the Orthodox faith, with her eldest sister, Princess Margareta, as godmother. Queen Marie, her paternal great-grandmother, was her namesake. As a young girl, Maria and her sisters were told \\"fascinating tales of a homeland they couldn't visit\\" by their father. Maria was educated in Switzerland where the family lived during exile, and spent most her early adult life living and working in the USA, including New York and New Mexico. Careers Her teenage years were spent in Switzerland with her family, where she received her primary and secondary education. Maria later moved to the United States to pursue her studies in childcare. After completing her studies, Maria worked briefly in the childcare field. After her brief career in childcare, Maria pursued a career in New York, doing public relations for private companies. During the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Maria, along with the rest of the royal family, worked to help the victims of those affected. In New York, Maria helped console the many U.S relatives of those killed in the uprising. When the situation in Romania eventually calmed down she left her public relations career and moved to New Mexico where she worked in private consulting until she moved to Romania in 2015.  Activities in Romania  Princess Maria visited Romania with her parents and other members of the family in 1997, and from this point onwards began visiting the country regularly for Christmas or family events such as her parents' 60th Wedding Anniversary and King Michael's 90th Birthday celebrations. On 7 May 2014 Princess Maria was invested with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown in a ceremony conducted by Crown Princess Margareta at the Elisabeta Palace to mark Maria's upcoming 50th birthday. This was followed by a dinner at the Palace attended by the Prime Minister of Romania (Victor Ponta) and other guests. On 21 April 2015 it was announced by the Romanian cosmetic company Farmec that Maria is an official ambassador of the company, where she will participate in projects to promote products created in the research lab of the company, as well as social responsibility activities undertaken by Farmec. In January 2015 it was announced that Princess Maria would move to Romania permanently to take on activities in support of the royal family, and she was present in the public commemorations in Bucharest of 25 years since the royal family's return later the same month. Maria has represented the royal family at events across the country, acted in support of Margareta, Custodian of the Crown and taken on a number of patronages including Concordia Humanitarian Organisation. During her father's illnesses, Maria and her elder sisters took turns to be with him at his home in Switzerland and it was during Maria's stay that King Michael passed away. She is a member of the Princess Margareta Foundation. Marriage and divorce Marriage On 16 September 1995, Maria married Kazimierz Wiesław Mystkowski (b. 13 September 1958 in Łaś-Toczyłowo), a Polish nobleman from the Mystkowski family and a computer engineer. Raised in a Catholic family, he is the son of Eugeniusz Mystkowski and his wife, Janina Wadelowska. The wedding celebration was held at the Greek Orthodox Holy Trinity Cathedral in New York, and was attended by the Romanian royal family, the parents of Kazimierz, the newly married Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Greece. King Michael I served as koumbaros to the couple. As Kazimierz was Roman Catholic, Maria lost her place in line of Succession to the British throne under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, however she was reinstated to the line of succession on 26 March 2015 with the coming into force of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. Divorce In 2003 the couple subsequently divorced without producing any children.

Her first novel, Constance: A Story of Early Plymouth (1968) is based on the life of her forbear Constance Hopkins - a passenger on the Mayflower. It was nominated for the National Book Award in 1969. Her second book, Jane-Emily (1969) was described by Sarah Lyall in the New York Times nearly 50 years after its publication as \\"one of the great children’s ghost stories, featuring a nasty little dead girl who is not at all pleased when a good little living girl comes to stay in her old house.\\" Most of Clapp's novels were written as fictionalized accounts of historical events. Dr. Elizabeth: The Story of the First Woman Doctor (1974) focuses on the life of Elizabeth Blackwell who was the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States. I'm Deborah Sampson: A Soldier in the War of the Revolution is loosely based on the life of Deborah Sampson, a young woman who disguised herself as a man and served in the 4th Massachusetts Regiment during the Revolutionary War. Witches' Children: A Story of Salem (1982) and The Tamarack Tree: A Novel of the Siege of Vicksburg (1986) explore the history of the Salem witch trials and the Siege of Vicksburg during the Civil War, respectively. Early life Clapp was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father Howard was a dentist who died less than a year after her birth. Her mother, Elizabeth Blatchford Clapp, supported the family by running a toothbrush importing business. After her mother's remarriage, the family moved to Montclair, New Jersey where Clapp spent her childhood. As a young woman she studied journalism at Columbia University, but left before graduating. She married Edward della Torre Cone, a transportation consultant, in 1933. As a young mother, she started writing plays for her daughter's girl scout troop. Between 1956 and 1979 she published over 20 plays for young actors and 3 for adult ensembles.\\"Patricia Clapp.\\" Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults, Gale, 2002. Career Her career as a novelist began while she was working on a genealogy project and discovered she was descended from Constance Hopkins who sailed on the Mayflower. \\"It was in those pages that I discovered Constance Hopkins who came to America with her family on the Mayflower. The more I copied that mass of material the more I thought about Constance. Fourteen years old, snatched from a familiar, comfortable life in London by an enthusiastic adventurer of a father, carted off to a land of wolves and Indians--how did she feel? I spent a lot of time thinking about her.\\"Something about the Author Autobiography Series, Vol. 4, Detroit, Gale, 1987 Clapp didn't publish after 1986 but in her working years she alternated her writing with her work in community theater and spending time with her family. She explained in Something About the Author in 1987: \\"Writing I can do when I choose to, not because I have to for financial reasons. I can afford to wait for the first flicker of an idea, to spend as long as I like on research, and then to lose myself in another era, living with people I will only know in my imagination, but who will become totally real to me.\\"'\\"Patricia Clapp.\\" Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults, Gale, 2002.

The long distance path was opened in autumn 2010.Wanderweg Pfälzer Höhenweg wird eröffnet. In: RuhrNachrichten, 23 September 2010. Retrieved 6 November 2013. One year later, in September 2011, it was given its status as a Prädikat path.Höhenweg: Zahlen, Daten, Fakten. Website von Rheinland-Palatinate Tourismus. Retrieved 6 November 2013.  Route  The Palatine Ridgeway runs in a semi-circle initially north around the Donnersberg, the highest mountain in the North Palatine Uplands and the whole Palatinate, then through the valleys northwest of the massif. The start point in the east is Winnweiler, the finish point in the west is Wolfstein station. Opened in spring 2011 the hiking trail runs entirely within the North Palatine Uplands. Its waymark and logo, like the other two paths, a hillside in a rectangular field, but with the differences that it is in blue and white, and has a stylised cloud and the name of the path.  Character  The path, with its climbs and descents, runs through one of the most important tourist attractions of the Palatinate: the large, forested, hill range of the North Palatine Uplands. The route has 3,300 metres of uphill and 3,200 metres of downhill gradient. Its lowest point is at 148 metres in the small town of Meisenheim and its highest point, at 687 metres, is the summit of the Donnersberg.

He grew up in a Hasidic Jewish home and attended a traditional heder. Later he went to yeshiva and studied general subjects with a private teacher. His father, Ben- Zion, was a businessman. While many Jewish families in the village earned their living from agriculture, Ben-Zion was a bookish type who stood out for his knowledge of Hebrew.“35 books – the crop of a Nahalal man,” Davar, March 31, 1967 (Hebrew) From a young age, Zvi took an interest in Zionism and joined a Zionist youth movement.

He published his first story in Gan Yerek, a journal published by Eliezer Yaffe in Petah Tikvah which became the organ of the Hapoel Hatzair in 1920. It was an article about bee-keeping in the Yemenite Jewish community. Over the years, he continued to write commentary and feature articles for Davar newspaper and Hapoel Hatzair. Lieberman, Zvi (November 21, 1969). Conversations with myself. Davar. In 1932, he began to write for children, first paperbacks like Oded the Wanderer and then hardcover books. In writing for children, he sought to provide an alternative to the cheap Yiddish books that children in the Yishuv read at the time. Over the years, Lieberman published dozens of picture books, fiction for teens and novels alongside serious research for adult audiences. In his semi-autobiographical A Tale of Love and Darkness, Israeli novelist Amos Oz relates that he read Lieberman’s book Over the Ruins multiple times as a child and it made a lasting impression on him.A Tale of Love and Darkness, Amos Oz, p.444-445 Films Oded Hill In 1933, Oded ha-noded was made into a silent film. It was the country’s first full-length feature film for children, produced on a shoestring budget with private financing. Important plot details were changed in the film. Oded is a young sabra who goes on a hike with school friends. When he strays from the others to record his impressions of the landscape he finds himself lost in the wilderness. After a week he reaches an Arab village, teaches the inhabitants to read and write, and finally returns home.Bar-Yosef, Eitan (2007). A Villa in the Jungle: Africa in Israeli Culture in Mark H.

Khalom ha-shlosha (“The Dream of Three), for example, is about three friends from the city of Safed, one of whom cares only about money, and another, only about having fun. Both are saved from a life of sin and wastefulness by the third friend who establishes a socialist commune. ‘ ’Tevel betkhiyata (Renaissance of a Universe) (1955), about a utopia built by astronauts on a trip to Mars, was one of the first science fiction books written in Hebrew.

It was most prevalent during the Cold War in line with the Truman Doctrine of containment, although some instances occurred during the early-20th-century \\"Banana Republic\\" era of Latin American history to promote American business interests in the region.  History  Argentina Jorge Rafael Videla meeting Jimmy Carter in 1977 In Argentina, military forces overthrew the democratically elected President Isabel Perón in the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, starting the military dictatorship of General Jorge Rafael Videla, known as the National Reorganization Process, resulting in around 30,000 forced disappearances. Both the coup and the following authoritarian regime was eagerly endorsed and supported by the United States government with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger paying several official visits to Argentina during the dictatorship. Among the many human rights violations committed during the period were extrajudicial arrests, mass executions, torture, rape, disappearances of political prisoners and dissenters, and illegal relocations of children born from pregnant women (both pregnant before their imprisonment or made pregnant by the continuous rape). According to Spanish judge Baltazar Garzón, Kissinger was a witness to these crimes. Bolivia The US government supported the 1971 coup led by General Hugo Banzer that toppled President Juan José Torres of Bolivia.North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) September 25, 2007, \\"Alliance for Power: U.S. Aid to Bolivia Under Banzer,\\" https://nacla.org/article/alliance-power-us-aid-bolivia-under-banzer Huffington Post, October 23, 2008 updated on May 25, 2011, \\"U.S. Intervention in Bolivia,\\" https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-zunes/us-intervention-in- bolivi_b_127528.html reposted from Foreign Policy in Focus Torres had displeased Washington by convening an \\"Asamblea del Pueblo\\" (People's Assembly or Popular Assembly), in which representatives of specific proletarian sectors of society were represented (miners, unionized teachers, students, peasants), and more generally by leading the country in what was perceived as a left wing direction. Banzer hatched a bloody military uprising starting on August 18, 1971, that succeeded in taking the reins of power by August 22, 1971. After Banzer took power, the US provided extensive military and other aid to the Banzer dictatorship as Banzer cracked down on freedom of speech and dissent, tortured thousands, \\"disappeared\\" and murdered hundreds, and closed labor unions and the universities.BBC News, March 5, 2009, \\"Hidden Cells Reveal Bolivia's Dark Past,\\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7925694.stm The Guardian, May 5, 2002, \\"Hugo Banzer: Former President and Dictator of Bolivia Who Headed a Brutal Military Regime,\\" https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/06/guardianobituaries.bolivia Torres, who had fled Bolivia, was kidnapped and assassinated in 1976 as part of Operation Condor, the US-supported campaign of political repression and state terrorism by South American right-wing dictators.National Security Archive March 8, 2013, \\"Operation Condor on Trial: Legal Proceeding on Latin American Rendition and Assassination Program Open in Buenos Aires,\\" https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB416/ However, in 1978 the Carter administration forced Banzer into a carefully regulated \\"democratic opening\\". A limited amnesty was declared and the country prepared for democratic elections. Many, including ousted President Evo Morales, termed the 2019 Bolivian political crisis as an American-backed coup d'état to tap the nation's large lithium reserves. Brazil Brazil experienced several decades of authoritarian governments, especially after the US-backed 1964 Brazilian coup d'état against social democrat João Goulart. Under then- President John F. Kennedy, the US sought to \\"prevent Brazil from becoming another China or Cuba\\", a policy which was carried forward under Lyndon B. Johnson and which led to US military support for the coup in April 1964. Cuba Chile Augusto Pinochet meeting George H. W. Bush After the democratic election of President Salvador Allende in 1970, an economic war ordered by President Richard Nixon, among other things, caused the 1973 Chilean coup d'état with the involvement of the CIA due to Allende’s democratic socialist leanings. What followed was the decades-long US-backed military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In 1988 a presidential referendum was held in order to confirm Pinochet’s ruling for 8 more years. The oppositional Concertation of Parties for Democracy endorsed the “No” option, winning the referendum and ending Pinochet’s rule democratically. After that free elections were held in 1989 with Concertation winning again.Corte revoca mayoría de procesamientos en caso Riggs, El Mercurio, 3 January 2007 Pinochet family arrested in Chile, BBC, 4 October 2007 Cobertura Especial: Detienen a familia y principales colaboradores de Pinochet, La Tercera, 4 October 2007 Costa Rica Costa Rica was the only country in Latin America that never had a long lasting authoritarian government in the 20th century. Its only dictatorship during the period was after the 1917 Costa Rican coup d'état led by Minister of War Federico Tinoco Granados against President Alfredo González Flores after González attempted to increase tax on the wealthy, and it lasted only two years. In fact, the US government lead by Democratic President Woodrow Wilson did not recognize Tinoco's rule and, despite the fact that the United Fruit Company was one of the affected companies by González' tax reform, helped the opposition that quickly overthrew Tinoco after a few months of warfare. Years later Christian socialist medic Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia of the National Republican Party would reach power through democratic means, promoting a general social reform and allied to the Costa Rican Communist Party. Tensions between government and the opposition, supported by the CIA, caused the short-lived Costa Rican Civil War of 1948 that ended Calderón's government and led to the short de facto rule of 18 months by José Figueres Ferrer. However Figueres also held some left-leaning ideas and continued the social reformation. In any case, after the war democracy was quickly restored and a two-party system encompassed by the parties of the Calderonistas and Figueristas developed in the country for nearly 60 years.  Dominican Republic  Trujillo in 1952 In May 1961, the ruler of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Trujillo was murdered with weapons supplied by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In January 1986, the Reagan administration began to pressure Duvalier to renounce his rule and to leave Haiti and \\"Baby Doc\\" fled to France in 1986 on a US Air Force flight. Eight months after what was widely considered the first honest election held in Haiti, the newly elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was deposed by the Haitian army. It is alleged by some that the CIA \\"paid key members of the coup regime forces, identified as drug traffickers, for information from the mid-1980s at least until the coup.\\" Coup leaders Cédras and François had received military training in the United States. But in after 1992 US general election Bill Clinton came to power.

Panama In 1903, the US aided the secession of Panama from the Republic of Colombia. The secession was engineered by a Panamanian faction backed by the Panama Canal Company, a French–US corporation whose aim was the construction of a waterway across the Isthmus of Panama thus connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In 1903, the US signed the Hay-Herrán Treaty with Colombia, granting the United States use of the Isthmus of Panama in exchange for financial compensationIn a state speech in December 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt put the number of \\"revolutions, rebellions, insurrections, riots, and other outbreaks\\" in Panama at 53, within the space of 57 years. in \\"Theodore Roosevelt's third state of the union address\\" amidst the Thousand Days' War. The Panama Canal was already under construction, and the Panama Canal Zone was carved out and placed under United States sovereignty. The US did not transfer the zone back to Panama until 2000.

Sun Sentinel, May 1, 1991. According to John Perkins's book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man the motive behind it was Torrijo's negotiations with Japanese businessmen to expand the Panama Canal excluding American firms.Perkins, John. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc., 2004. See pages 156–157 regarding Roldós' alleged assassination. Torrijos was also a supporter of the anti-Somoza FSLN rebel group in Nicaragua which stained his relationship with Reagan.Holly Sklar. Washington's War on Nicaragua (South End Press), p. 24. Torrijos was succeeded by more pro-American dictator Manuel Noriega, who sided with the US interests during Torrijos government. However, increasing tensions between Noriega and the US government also led to the United States invasion of Panama, which ended in Noriega's overthrowing.

This dominant-party authoritarian system was temporarily broken in the 2008 Paraguayan general election, when practically the entire opposition united in the Patriotic Alliance for Change and managed to elect former Bishop Fernando Lugo of the Christian Democratic Party as President of Paraguay. Lugo's government was praised for its social reforms including investments in low- income housing,http://www.rabobank.com/content/images/Paraguay-201101_tcm43-105909.pdf the introduction of free treatment in public hospitals, the introduction of cash transfers for Paraguay's most impoverished citizens and indigenous rights.. Peru Alberto Fujimori and Vladimiro Montesinos's Peruvian regime was supported by the CIA. Uruguay After 150 years of traditional democratic governments in Uruguay, a civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay backed by the United States started after the military-led 1973 Uruguayan coup d'état that suppressed the Constitution of Uruguay of 1967, empowering President Juan María Bordaberry as dictator. Trade union leaders and political opponents were arrested, killed or exiled, and human rights violations were abundant. Democracy was restored in the 1984 Uruguayan general election.  Venezuela  = 2002 = In April 2002, president Hugo Chávez was briefly ousted from power in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt. Members of the Bush administration held meetings with opposition leaders for months before the coup attempt. The OAS and all of Venezuela's neighbours denounced the coup attempt, but the United States acknowledged the new government. = 2013-2018 = Chávez died in office in 2013, and was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro. Maduro's presidency has coincided with a decline in Venezuela's socioeconomic status, with crime, inflation, poverty and hunger increasing. Analysts and critics have attributed Venezuela's decline to both Chávez and Maduro's economic policies, while Maduro has blamed speculation and economic warfare waged by his political opponents. Maduro continued the practice of his predecessor of denouncing alleged conspiracies against him or his government; in a period of fifteen months following his election, dozens of conspiracies, some supposedly linked to assassination and coup attempts, were reported by Maduro's government. In this same period, the number of attempted coups claimed by the Venezuelan government outnumbered all attempted and executed coups occurring worldwide in the same period. In early 2015, the Maduro government accused the United States of attempting to overthrow him. The Venezuelan government performed elaborate actions to respond to such reported attempts and to convince the public that its claims were true. The reactions included the arrest of Antonio Ledezma in February 2015, forcing American tourists to go through travel requirements and holding military marches and public exercises \\"for the first time in Venezuela's democratic history\\". After the United States ordered sanctions to be placed on seven Venezuelan officials for human rights violations, Maduro used anti-US rhetoric to bump up his approval ratings. Venezuelan political scientist Isabella Picón estimated that about 15% of Venezuelans took the coup allegations seriously, while for the rest it was \\"entertainment\\". In 2016, Maduro again claimed that the United States was attempting to assist the opposition with a coup attempt. On January 12, 2016, Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, threatened to invoke the Inter-American Democratic Charter, an instrument used to defend democracy in the Americas when threatened, when opposition National Assembly member were barred from taking their seats by the Maduro-aligned Supreme Court. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch, and the Human Rights Foundation called for the OAS to invoke the Democratic Charter. After more controversies and pursuing a recall on Maduro, on May 2, 2016, opposition members of the National Assembly met with OAS officials to ask for the body to implement the Democratic Charter. Two days later on May 4, the Maduro government called for a meeting the next day with the OAS, with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez stating that the United States and the OAS were attempting to overthrow Maduro. On May 17, 2016, in a national speech, Maduro called OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro \\"a traitor\\" and stated that he worked for the CIA. Almagro sent a letter rebuking Maduro, and refuting the claim. On May 20, 2018, Maduro was reelected in an election that had the lowest voter turnout in Venezuela's modern history, which as a result was described by some analysts as a show election. The majority of nations in the Americas and the Western world refused to recognize the validity of this election and of the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly, initiating their own sanctions against him and his administration as well, although allies such as China, Cuba, Iran, Russia and Turkey offered support and denounced what they described as interference in Venezuela's domestic affairs. = 2019-2020 = On January 23, 2019, the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, declared himself the acting President of the country, disputing Nicolás Maduro's presidency and sparking a presidential crisis. Shortly after Guaidó's announcement, along with allies and several other nations, the United States recognized Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Maduro's government says the crisis is a coup d'état orchestrated by the United States to topple him and control the country's oil reserves. Guaidó rejects the characterization of his actions as a coup, saying that his movement is backed by peaceful volunteers. US Vice President Mike Pence stated in April that the US was set on Maduro's removal, whether through diplomatic or other means, and that \\"all options\\" were on the table. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the US would take military action \\"if required\\". In December 2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the United States did not plan a military intervention in Venezuela, saying that \\"we have said that all options are on the table\\", but that \\"we have learned from history that the risks from using military force are significant\\". A memo obtained by Agence France-Presse described that the US Agency for International Development would divert $41.9 million to promote Guaidó, including $19.4 million for salaries and stipends for Guaidó's staff, covering their travel, and \\"other costs necessary to ensure full deployment of a transparent financial management system and other activities necessary for a democratic transition,\\" as well as $2 million to support the opposition in negotiations with the Maduro administration. In August 2019, President Donald Trump's administration imposed new additional sanctions on Venezuela as part of their efforts to remove Maduro from office, ordering a freeze on all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and barring transactions with US citizens and companies.

It is endemic to Asia; more specifically to Thailand.  Habitat  S. sirindhornae inhabit inland freshwater temporary waters, known as vernal pools.  Reproduction  S. sirnindhornae displays sexual dimorphism, featuring both male and female sexes. The species reproduces sexually, with the male shrimp fertilising the eggs of the female. Once fully formed, the eggs are released by the female shrimp. As seen in the adjacent image, the male shrimp features an additional enlarged frontal appendage used to grasp the female during mating. Furthermore, the female shrimp has a brood pouch attached to the base of the tail and last set of swimming appendages, which is used to hold the eggs (cysts) before and during fertilization, as well as throughout egg development. Once substantially developed, the eggs are then birthed from the brood pouch.  Behaviour  Like other fairy shrimp, S. sirnindhornae share the universal ability to enter diapause, a state of biological dormancy where growth and metabolism are arrested, as an egg (commonly called a cyst). This trait assists in both species dispersal and in overcoming adverse environmental conditions that threaten biological continuity. Once dormant, these cysts can withstand conditions as harsh and diverse as droughts, frosts, hypersaline conditions, complete desiccation, exposure to UV radiation and the vacuum of space.

Market Each year, 400 to 450 aircraft are scrapped and disassembled globally, for a $2 billion market for aircraft parts, and 12,500 aircraft will reach their end-of-life in the 20 years after 2009. Of those, around one third are parted out and disassembled by members of the AFRA. The AFRA is an international non-profit association aiming to promote environmental best practices, regulatory excellence and sustainable developments in the fields of aircraft disassembly, as well as the salvaging and recycling aircraft parts and materials. Retirements peaked at more than 700 in 2013 and declined to about 500 in 2016 while strong demand and relatively low fuel prices keep older airliners flying, the in-service aircraft older than 15 years grew by more than 1,600 between 2013 and 2017. As part prices were high in early 2018, some young, 15–20 years old A319 and A320s are being parted out. Decommissions should rise to 750 annually, 3,900 from 2018 through 2022, while manufacturers plan to ramp up deliveries to 2,200 aircraft in 2020. In 2018, airliner retirement slowed to 1.75% of the fleet in 2018, down from 2.5% in 2017 and a 3.5% peak in 2013 according to Morgan Stanley in February 2019. At the time, Jefferies forecast a 2.3% average retirement over the next five years and reported 505 retirements in 2018. At the end of January 2019, there were 1,186 parked aircraft, 5.5% of the fleet down from 6.7% a year before and well below the past 20 years average. Aircraft lessors own 16% of the parked fleet, up from 9% a decade before. Most of the parked fleet is unlikely to fly again. The parked fleet is 31% widebody (8% of the active fleet) and 69% narrowbody (5%), a lower availability due to the ramp of the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo. The parked aircraft include 250 Boeing 737 Classics, 158 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s, 64 Boeing 757s and 66 Airbus A340s; while 501 are in-production models with 166 widebodies including 67 Boeing 777s, mostly 777-200s. UBS notes the above- average air transport growth favour slower retirements, which could increase new deliveries deferrals, compensated for the manufacturers with a larger aftermarket parts revenue as they want a larger share of the $120 billion-a- year aftermarket, growing at over 4% per year.  Storage statistics  Lessor Avolon count 2,100 aircraft are in storage in 2017 with 1,000 which shouldn't fly again: half are parked for more than three years and the other half is older than 25 years. A parked airplane may return to service if it's younger than 15 and aircraft parked over three years have a 50% chance of flying again, dropping to 20% for aircraft stored over five years. With owners accepting their assets value, this 2,100 should remain constant as the global jet transport fleet doubles to 51,800 over the next 20 years with 43,000 new deliveries and 16,000 retirements projected through 2037. Process Ilyushin Il-86 cut at Sheremetyevo Airport Airliners are typically operated for 20 to 30 years. Corrosion, metal fatigue, and low availability of new spare parts are problems encountered in greater frequency the older a machine becomes. Eventually, these factors, alongside improvements in fuel-efficiency and reduction in maintenance cost of newer machines, reduce the economic viability of the operation of older airliners. Consequently, they may be stored, or scrapped and recycled. Vast expanses of arid desert are ideal for storage because hangars are not needed to maintain the aircraft at low humidity. Upon arrival, aircraft are washed to remove corroding salt, drained of fuel and lubricated with a light viscous oil. Explosive devices from the evacuation slides are removed, air ducts sealed, and an easily removable protective coat of paint may be applied. Some airliners are kept in working order as reserves, and a few are involved in fire-fighting and aerospace training schemes or in safety tests. Most are used as a source of spare parts and scrapped. The scrapping process takes six weeks and begins with the removal of the explosive escape equipment and toxic de-icing fluid. Some components are unbolted and salvaged, including the engines and instruments, while the fuel is drained away. The seats are worth from $450 to $5,000 and the landing gear can be sold for millions of dollars, although all parts need a Certificate of Airworthiness to be reused. Cables, batteries and other electronic waste are fed into the conventional recycling chains. Plastic interior components are considered not recyclable, as they are made of mixed plastics and contain flame retardant chemicals. The remaining shell is cut into pieces and broken down by an industrial shredder so that the aluminium can be melted down. The scrap metal is ground up, mechanically sorted by density and magnetism, then sold to the trade. A future challenge for disposal is the construction of aircraft which use composite materials, such as aluminium/fibreglass GLARE in the Airbus A380. There are also concerns about contamination with alloys and the dumping of non-recyclable materials. McDonnell Douglas MD-11 part out An airliner can be dismantled in 1,500-2,000 parts (1,000 or so LRUs) in 30–60 days including engines, landing gear, auxiliary power units and components but it can be parked a year or two to maximise the part harvesting. A metal aircraft can be recycled up to 85-90% by mass with a 95% goal, and 85-90% could be maintained for composite airframes as the industry adapts with a carbonfibre market growing 12-14% a year towards 100,000t in 2019 of which 50% could be satisfied with recycled material.  Places  The Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona is home to 4,400 retired aircraft, primarily military, and the Mojave Air and Space Port has stored over 1000 civilian planes since recycling began. Purpose-built recycling platforms may be used, such as those of Bartin Aero Recycling at Châteauroux-Déols airport in France, Air Salvage International at Cotswold Airport, UK, and the Evergreen Aircenter, in Marana, US. Airbus has set up a centre in Tarbes Airport in France to research the decommission and recycling of older aircraft as part of the PAMELA Project.

Description Galanthus plicatus is a bulbous perennial plant, growing to about 15 cm tall. Its leaves are bluish or greyish green, broader than many other species of Galanthus, up to 2 cm wide. The leaf edges are folded back away from the upper surface of the leaf, both in bud and after they expand. The nodding white flowers appear in spring and have six white tepals. The outer three are all white, 2–3 cm long; the inner three are shorter and notched, with a green mark above the notch, often extending to beyond the middle of the tepal. In G. plicatus subsp. byzantinus, the inner tepals also have a green mark at the base.

(1975) is a reference work, co-written by Jacqueline Lichtenberg, Sondra Marshak, and Joan Winston, which explored the relationship between the Star Trek television series and the fandom that emerged following the series' cancellation. Published by Bantam Books. The book is among the earliest publications to discuss Star Trek convention culture, fan clubs, and fanzines. The ninth chapter contains an essay by Lichtenberg and Marshak on the fan fiction.  Production  Jacqueline Lichtenberg, a professionally published author whose Kraith fan fiction was regularly published by fanzines, explored the possibility of selling an article, or series of articles, to newspapers concerning the growing Star Trek fandom. She began research in late 1971. While building a directory on fan clubs, their activities, and the growing number of fan published newsletters, and fanzines, she realized there was more potential for a reference book on the subject than a newspaper article. Science fiction fanzines had existed prior to Star Trek, however their focus was on publishing articles, research pieces, and letters from fans. Star Trek fanzines were also publishing fan fiction, some of which Lichtenberg believed was comparable to the television series. A query package was assembled by Lichtenberg, and shared with publishers. However, the query was rejected by all, including by Frederick Pohl at Bantam Books, who were publishing a series episode novelizations by James Blish, and who had also published Blish's original Star Trek novel, Spock Must Die! (1970). Only after James Blish had failed to deliver a new Star Trek novel, did Pohl agree to buy Lichtenberg's book without having seen a draft. Lichtenberg recruited fellow fan writer Sondra Marshak, and television producer Joan Winston, to help draft and finish the book. Gene Roddenberry was commissioned to write an introduction. Myrna Culbreath also provided some input. Her character analysis on the Spock character, \\"The Spock Premise,\\" was cited in the acknowledgements. According to Lichtenberg, the book took several years to write. The final draft, delivered to Pohl, had undergone significant changes from the original premise, so the authors were unable to agree on a title. The title, Star Trek Lives!, and the subtitle \\"Personal Notes and Anecdotes\\" were chosen by the publisher. Plans to include a comprehensive directory of fan clubs, fanzines, and selections of curated fan fiction were withdrawn, due to length, and publication cost. The professional publication of fan-written fiction evolved into The New Voyages series, edited by Marshak and Culbreath. Released in , Star Trek Lives! proved popular, and was given eight printings between 1975 and 1979.  Contents  *Foreword by Gene Roddenberry *Introduction by the authors. *Chapter 1The Discovery Effect: An essay on the seductive draw of the new and refreshing stories presented by the television series. *Chapter 2The Tailored Effect: Lichtenberg studies the various \\"tailored\\" effects, such as characters, plotting, and settings, that resulted in the mass-appeal of the series. *Chapter 3I Should Never Have Answered The Phone: Joan Winston reminisces on the role she played during the production of the first Star Trek convention which opened on . *Chapter 4The Spock Charisma Effect: An essay on the popularity of the half-human, half-alien, second officer of the Enterprise. The writers argue the reason for the character's popularity is the viewers are given far more opportunities to learn about Spock's personality and personal history, than other characters, including Captain Kirk. Spock is described as having sex appeal. *Chapter 5The Optimism Effect: Lichtenberg and Marshak discuss \\"vision of a brighter future of man, and of a world characterized by hope, achievement and understanding.\\" They argue such a positive, forward-thinking premise resulted in viewers taking on such an aspiration as a guide for their own personal successes. *Chapter 6The Goal Effect: An essay exploring the idea \\"that important goals are worthwhile, worth striving for and -- attainable.\\" The attainment of co-operation between civilizations within the Star Trek universe being an allusion to the cooperation among the nations and people of Earth. *Chapter 7Beauty May Be Only Skin Deep, But Chopped Liver Can Get You Anywhere Or Six Glorious Days On The Star Trek Set: Winston reminisces on her visit to the Desilu Studios during the filming of \\"Turnabout Intruder\\"—the final episode of the series. *Chapter 8What Are They Doing Now?: Interviews with former cast members and producers of the televisions series, includes details on their future projects. *Chapter 9Do-It-Yourself Star Trek – The Fan Fiction: Marshak and Lichtenberg explain what fan fiction is, its place in the general fandom, and offer some advice to the reader on how to write fan fiction. One of the questions posted in the essay is \\"Why so many female writers of Star Trek fiction?\\"  Reception  According to Lichtenberg, the initial reaction among fans was mixed as \\"they were expecting a history of the fandom.\\" One fan wrote a scathing review in a letter to The Halkan Council (1975), saying they felt cheated since \\"I would much rather have [read] an analysis of the fans of Star Trek … than of the show itself.\\" Lichtenberg agreed with the reviewer's feelings that many fans felt a true anthropological study of \\"the fandom [was] rare and invaluable\\" In subsequent interviews, she admitted that \\"Star Trek Lives! was not perfect.\\" Other fans reflected differently on the book. Sue Bursztynski wrote in her review of Harry, A History (2008) that Star Trek Lives! \\"let me know that this sort of thing was going on, and what kind of activities fans got up to.\\" Fan fiction writer Patricia Poole said in Anne Jamison's Fic: Why Fanfiction is Taking Over The World (2014) that she was \\"stunned\\" to find things she had written \\"transformed into pages in a real book.\\" Poole had corresponded with Lichtenberg on the subject of \\"the discovery effect,\\" inspired by her experiences at a Detroit-area Star Trek convention. Gary McGath wrote, in an issue of the MIT student-run editorial Ergo (1975), that Star Trek was far from the perfect \\"romantic drama,\\" but Star Trek Lives! \\"does the best job thus far of showing just what the series accomplishes.\\" Likewise, Winston Howlett wrote in an issue of fanzine Probe that readers should not be deterred from \\"picking up and reading this very well-written[,] and very entertaining book.\\" And that it belongs on every fan's shelf, \\"for it makes up a large, healthy chunk of the [Star Trek] saga, telling where we've been, where we are now, and where we hope to be going.\\" Lichtenberg, Marshak and Winston, were named the \\"foremothers of fanfiction scholarship\\" by Francesca Coppa in The Fanfiction Reader (2017), due to their work on Star Trek Lives!, and the catalyzing effect the book had on fan scholarship. Edward Gross and Mark A. Altman lauded Star Trek Lives! as a \\"seminal\\" work in the first volume of The Fifty Year Mission (2016). J.M. Verba, in her fandom history Boldly Writing (2003), credited Star Trek Lives! for increasing \\"fanzine recognition far beyond the wildest dreams of any editor.\\"  See also  * Trekkie * Fanzine * Fan fiction * Kirk/Spock * Star Trek (Bantam Books)  References   External links  * Category:Bantam Books books Category:Books about Star Trek Category:Books based on Star Trek Category:Books by Jacqueline Lichtenberg Category:Books by Sondra Marshak Category:Books by Joan Winston Category:Star Trek Category:Literary collaborations Category:1975 non-fiction books ","title":"Star Trek Lives!"},{"id":"56153495","text":"The December 2017 Kabul suicide bombing occurred on 28 December 2017, when militants attacked a Shiite cultural centre in Kabul, Afghanistan.

The principal participants were James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton, and Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun. Both men died from wounds received. Background Although ostensibly fought over a disputed inheritance, the duel had strong political overtones. Mohun was a prominent Whig while Hamilton had close links to the Tory government of Robert Harley. Hamilton had recently been appointed as British Ambassador to Paris where he was expected to negotiate the peace agreement that would end the War of the Spanish Succession. Mohun's political patron the Duke of Marlborough had recently been dismissed from his command, and was strongly opposed to the peace plan. This may have motivated Mohun to issue his challenge. Mohun had developed a reputation as a violent and frequent duellist, having been involved in several fatal encounters. His father, the 3rd Baron Mohun, had himself been killed in a duel. Duel Hamilton accepted Mohun's challenge to fight with swords. Hamilton selected his relation Colonel John Hamilton as his second, while Mohun employed his friend and political ally the Irish officer George Macartney. As was often customary at the time, seconds actively engaged in the combat. The group assembled in Hyde Park very early in the morning. Once the duel began, Hamilton and Mohun went at each other \\"like wild beasts, not fencing or parrying\\". In these fierce exchanges both Mohun and Hamilton were wounded. Mohun was run through the chest, a fatal wound, while Hamilton was cut on the arm. Exactly what happened next remained contentious. Colonel Hamilton claimed that, with the duel over, he went to the assistance of the Duke who had dropped his sword. Macartney stepped forward and delivered a fatal blow to him. The Duke soon died of his wounds. Aftermath The two seconds, Macartney and Colonel Hamilton were both charged as accessories to murder. While Hamilton gave himself up, Macartney fled into exile in Hanover. He only returned to Britain once George I came to the throne. Based on Hamilton's testimony, Tories in Parliament portrayed the whole affair as a Whig plot designed to derail the prospective peace agreement with France. After being put on trial in December 1712, Colonel Hamilton was found guilty of manslaughter. He received a much lesser punishment than he might potentially have been given because the jury accepted his claim that he had not known a duel was to take place when he arrived at the park. The apparent savagery of the duel led to a public outcry. This reinvigorated the campaign to clamp down on dueling, and in April 1713 Queen Anne spoke out against the practice. While dueling continued to be a popular way of settling disputes during the eighteenth century, fresh conventions developed such as the use of pistols rather than swords. The traditional involvement of seconds in the actual fighting rapidly declined. In popular culture The duel forms the basis for a scene in William Makepeace Thackeray's 1852 novel The History of Henry Esmond.

Plot and gameplay The player is a political leader in the year 2001. The world is divided into 31 different states over 5 large countries. Their task is to become ruler of the world by the year 2500. The gameplay is similar to other 4X strategies like the Civilization series. The isometric world map is accurate to 2500 square kilometres. The game is management first, and storyline second. Production The 3rd Millennium came out in France in 1997, and in early 1998 in the United States. The representation of the game's elements is based on \\"actual census, socio-economic and ecological projections for the period 2000 to 2500\\". While the game is serious and accurate in terms of data, the developers added humour and political incorrectness to ensure the player did not take the game too seriously. According to producer Stephan Ressot, there is no combat in the game because he didn't think conquering entire continents with military power was realistic in the modern world. Critical reception PC Powerplay gave the game a rating of 52%. PC Player gave it 38%. Cyro Interactive believes that the game failed to make an impact in Japan as the culture does not understand a \\"game of political intrigue with humour\\". PC Zone felt that while the game's soundscape was \\"undeniably clever and surprisingly atmospheric\\", its gameplay was boring. Avoc compared the title to Maxis' real-time strategy and management hybrid Sim City.

It is located west of San Michele di Pagana, close to the boundary with Santa Margherita Ligure. The fort was originally built by the Republic of Genoa, and today it belongs to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta along with the rest of the villa. Together with the Castello di Santa Margherita Ligure to the west and the to the east, it formed part of the Genoese coastal defence system for the protection of villages on the western Tigullio gulf. History Construction of the fort began in April 1625 by the Republic of Genoa, the capitaneati of Rapallo, Recco, Chiavari and the podesterie of Moneglia and Sestri Levante. Its construction became necessary due to the open hostilities between Genoa and Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, which raised fears of a Piedmontese land or sea attack. The fort cost over 50,000 lire, and construction work progressed rapidly thanks to new taxes that allowed for the purchase of the material and paying workers' salaries. Construction was well underway by December 1625, and the moat and drawbridge were ready by 1627. The fort was fully completed and commissioned by the Republic of Genoa on 28 July 1631. It was armed with enough weapons, ammunition and gunpowder for a sudden attack. Fortunately for the inhabitants of the nearby village of San Michele di Pagana, the area was never attacked by pirates or enemy soldiers and the fort never saw use. In 1644, the Genoese senate ordered the castellan to abandon the fort and send all military equipment inside on a galley to Genoa. Part of the fort's walls. The castle was subsequently garrisoned by local soldiers, and it became the headquarters of the Commissariato di Sanità di Rapallo (Health Commissariat of Rapallo). The Bombardment of Genoa by the French fleet in 1684 caused fears of another attack, so the fort was rearmed. However, no attacks occurred, and the fort was finally abandoned in 1705. It later became private property, forming part of the grounds of the nearby Villa Pagana. The fort has belonged to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta since 1959, when the last owner of the villa passed on the entire property to the Order.

It is located on Punta Pagana, close to the boundary with Santa Margherita Ligure, and it includes a private park containing the 17th- century Castello di Punta Pagana. The house has been one of the magisterial residences of the Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta since 1959, and it is therefore locally known as the Villa dei Cavalieri di Malta or simply Villa Malta. These names are incorrect since they should be exclusively associated with the Villa del Priorato di Malta in Rome. History The villa from the Prelo beach of San Michele di Pagana The construction of the villa was commissioned by the Orero family, who probably originated from the homonymous locality in the , in the early 17th century, after they purchased the land from the Giudice family from Rapallo. Historical documents show that the first owner was Francesco Orero. After his death in 1609, ownership of the building passed to his sons Francesco and Bernardo, who managed and shared the entire patrimony until 1641 and extended the building to its present state. The boundaries of the property have remained almost unchanged since then. The villa was later managed by Francesco Orero, and it passed to his sons Gerolamo and Dionisio following his death in 1644. The latter's financial problems resulted in the property being sold to the Marquis Pier Francesco Cattaneo. After he died in 1708, it passed to his brother Paolo Maria Cattaneo. The villa's park at Punta Pagana Through family ties, the building eventually passed from the to the Spinola family. The latter embellished both the villa and the surrounding park, including decorating the interior with fine furnishings and works of art, and planting trees including Cedar of Lebanon on the grounds. During this period, the building hosted a number of prominent personalities, including Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and his brother Giovanni in 1816, and Queen Margherita of Savoy and her brother Thomas of Savoy in the early 20th century. In a will of 1955, Admiral Franco Spinola made a will leaving the entire property of the villa, including the castle in its grounds, to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta by 1959.

This article deals with the fireworks policy in the Netherlands. Fireworks in the Netherlands are mostly regulated by the Vuurwerkbesluit (\\"Fireworks Decree\\"), a 1993 law that has subsequently been amended many times to make the rules surrounding the production, testing, transportation, storage, trade, sale, consumption and overall safety of fireworks stricter. During most of the year, most fireworks are restricted to usage by professionals, but there is an exception for ordinary citizens without any special training or licence to ignite fireworks during New Year's Eve from 6 pm on 31 December to 2 am on 1 January. Especially since the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster, and more so since the accident-laden New Year's Eve of 2007/08, public discussion on more rigorous regulation or even prohibition on (consumer) fireworks has been frequent and ongoing.  Annual events   New Year's Eve  1967 New Year's Eve news item. At New Year's Eve, ordinary Dutch citizens are allowed to light fireworks from 6 pm on 31 December to 2 am on 1 January. Fireworks need to comply to certain legal standards, and may only be sold during the last three days of the year, excluding any Sundays, at a shop that has a licence. Fireworks are often lit in the streets or in people's backyard.  Koningsdag  During Koningsdag (\\"King's Day\\"), several municipalities throughout the country organize fireworks shows by professionals.  Vuurwerkfestival Scheveningen  The Vuurwerkfestival Scheveningen (Scheveningen Fireworks Festival), conducted by professionals, is annually attended by around 200,000 people. In the summer of 2017, the festival experienced its 38th edition. In 2016, there were winter fireworks shows for the first time.  Regulation and enforcement  2017 Dutch Safety Board report on fireworks risks (English subtitles).  Fireworks companies  The Netherlands used to host several fireworks manufacturers, but in the late 20th century, almost all production of fireworks was moved abroad. In 2000, there were 26 fireworks companies active in the Netherlands, with branches in Leeuwarden, Appingedam, Lichtenvoorde, Tilburg, The Hague, Enschede, Leiden, Lijnden, Dronten, Lelystad and Landgraaf. 14 of these imported fireworks from especially China for sale on the Dutch market, the 12 other businesses conducted professional fireworks shows. In some factories such as S.E. Fireworks (which ceased producing fireworks itself in 1985), Chinese fireworks were further assembled in the Netherlands before being sold. Since the 1991 explosion of the fireworks factory in Culemborg, almost all fireworks companies operated outside of residential areas; S.E. Fireworks, which caused the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster, was the last company to still be located in the middle of a residential area before a planned relocation in 2002.  Safety testing  In the Netherlands, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) is responsible for safety testing of fireworks. Since 2010, safety testing of fireworks is required in the entire European Union, but companies are allowed to test their products in one member state before importing and selling them in another. A 2010 document from the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment revealed that several fireworks importers in the Netherlands did not yet comply with the new testing regulations, but were not penalised for it because a number of companies claimed they needed more time to implement the changes, and they were granted exceptions by the Ministry. Dream Fireworks owner Frits Pen, who claimed to have had his fireworks tested in Hungary for thousands of euros, sued the Ministry for failing to punish his competitors who were allowed to import and sell untested fireworks for free. In 2014, the Ministry stated that, by then, 80% of the fireworks imported into the Netherlands had a CE marking and were being checked. According to a 2017 report by the Dutch Safety Board, 25% of all fireworks tested failed to meet safety standards and were banned from sale.  Injury, damage and nuisance  A mailbox made hufterproof (\\"asshole- proof\\") to prevent vandals from inserting fireworks. Fireworks in the Netherlands are known to cause various negative effects to users, bystanders and people living nearby, especially around New Year's Eve, when extra police, firefighters and paramedics are deployed to control the situation. Which measures do and do not work, and how matters may be improved without 'ruining the party', is subject to ongoing discussion. The negative effects of fireworks can be divided into: *Noise pollution because of unexpectedly loud explosions (especially troublesome for animals) *Air pollution because of the smoke created by fireworks (in 2008, smog by fireworks smoke caused dozens of traffic accidents, killing two people) *Injuries and fear of being hit by fireworks (either by accident or on purpose;Politie: vuurwerk gooien naar hulpverleners strenger bestraffen NOS, 23 December 2017 during New Year's Eve 2016/17, 61% of victims were bystanders, 39% were the igniters themselves) *Vandalism and accidents by (illegal) fireworks causing damage and destruction to infrastructure and property *Disruption of public order by, amongst other things, violence against public servants (police, firefighters and paramedics) using fireworks  National and European legislation  Balkenende on fireworks and other incidents during New Year's Eve 2007/08 The original Vuurwerkbesluit was adopted in 1993, and was primarily concerned with environmental issues. In the wake of the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster, the Dutch government approved new rules regarding consumer and professional fireworks on 22 January 2002, especially concerning the safety of fireworks storage. Since then, the Vuurwerkbesluit has been amended a number of additional times, including the 2014 limitation of the period during which fireworks may be lit during New Year's Eve from 10 am to 6 pm on 31 December. Since the adoption of the 2007 European Pyrotechnic articles Directive, the Dutch Vuurwerkbesluit has been amended by 2010 to harmonise legislation with that of other EU member states concerning, amongst other things, the categorisation, trade and safety of fireworks, and a common approach of countering illegal fireworks. The updated 2013 Pyrotechnic articles Directive led to another amendment of the Vuurwerkbesluit. So-called \\"consumer fireworks\\" (consumentenvuurwerk or particulier vuurwerk) in the Netherlands consists of category F1 (on sale and usable throughout the year by every person aged 12 and older without a special licence or training), and category F2 and F3 (on sale the last three days of the year, Sundays excepted, which are to be lit from 6 pm on 31 December until 2 am on 1 January). Category F4 is reserved for professionals, and aside from New Year's Eve, categories F2 and F3 are also reserved for professionals. In Belgium, Germany and Denmark, the sale of all category F3 fireworks to consumers is forbidden, but in the Netherlands, some fireworks in this category may be purchased by lay people. Since 2011, the Dutch College of Attorney Generals has pushed for stricter European rules on fireworks, to prevent category F4 fireworks from being bought in other EU countries and smuggled into the Netherlands. Because of \\"flaws in the Pyrotechnic articles Directive\\", there are dangers for local security and terrorist threats. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#DCDCDC; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 30%;\\" cellspacing=\\"4\\" -  style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  It's an intellectual faux pas to assume accidents, eye injuries, can only be caused by illegal fireworks. No. I suspect 80% of my patients are [harmed by] legal fireworks. -   right;\\"  Tjeerd de Faber, ophthalmologist (2014) } The Netherlands also have a considerable illegal fireworks problem. In 2014, about 1 million kilos of illegal fireworks entered the country annually. According to inquiries by VeiligheidNL, illegal fireworks used to cause most fireworks-related injuries, (in 2012/13 almost two-thirds of all fireworks-related injuries), but since New Year's Eve of 2013/14 more than half was caused by legal fireworks. Illegal fireworks were responsible for more serious injuries, however, and resulted in four times as many hospitalisations. In 2014/15, the percentage of injuries by illegal fireworks decreased to almost 40%. During New Year's Eve 2015/16 and 2016/17, illegal fireworks were to blame for about 25% of fireworks-related injuries.

Työmies was a filterless cigarette, which means it had a hollow paper cone that was open at the ends. In order to reduce the risk of tobacco spilling in the mouth, a short wooden cigarette holder that came with the package had to be attached to the cigarette. If the holder was lost, the cone could be flattened or blocked with cotton wool. Amongst the people, Työmies, Klubi, and other spin-wraps were called \\"pillitupakki\\" or \\"pöllitupakki\\".Yle:Kysy mitä vain Luettu 13.11.2007 History The Greek businessman Achilles Kyriako Christides founded Fennia in 1899 and started manufacturing the Työmies cigarette in 1902. The brand was so popular that Fennia soon focused exclusively on its manufacture. In 1913 the factory moved to a building designed by architect Valter Jung and Emil Fabritius in the Koskikara block at the corner of Ruoholahdenkatu and Köydenpunojankatu streets in Helsinki.Eeva Järvenpää: Työmies oli Fennian kysytyin tupakka Helsingin Sanomat 3.5.2009. Viitattu 17.8.2013.Eeva Järvenpää: Fennian tupakkatehdas hallitsi Ruoholahdenkadun päätä Helsingin Sanomat 3.5.2009. Viitattu 17.8.2013. Finland's coat of arms, a lion with a sword, was printed on the boxes of the Työmies cigarettes. Työmies, which was now known as \\"the people's cigarette\\" was marketed, among other things, as an economic one: \\"Smoking Työmies cigarettes is economical as, in terms of tobacco quantity, a box of Työmies cigarettes is equal to 2–3 boxes of cigarettes with a paper holder.\\" (Finnish Social Democrat, May 1932) Various posters for this brand were also made during the 1930s. In the fall of 1945, when the luxury supplies were put on ration stamps, a woodcutter who cut four stacked cubic meters of logs was able to buy a \\"logging site power pack\\" containing coffee, sugar and Työmies cigarettes.Metsämiesten säätiö - Viisi vuosikymmentä metsän ja metsämiesten asialla Luettu 13.11.2007 Boxes of Työmies cigarettes were also part of the food parcels given to Finnish soldiers fighting the Russian efforts to seize Finland during World War II. Especially through the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, foreign cigarette brands arrived in Finland and the domestic production slowed down. Työmies was manufactured for decades up to 1984 when the Medicines Board prohibited its production as such because of the high levels of tar and nicotine.

This lake extends into the townships of Boyvinet, Lesueur, Ghent and Esperance. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second with a navigable body of water from one end to the other, skirting Opawica Island. This lake is formed by an enlargement of the Opawica River and includes a dam at its mouth. The northern and western portions of the Lake Opawica watershed are accessible via the forest road route 113 linking Chibougamau to Lebel-sur-Quévillon. A forest road serving the southern, eastern and northern shores of Opawica and Wachigabau lakes connects via the north to route 113. The southern part is accessible through the Canadian National Railway which passes between these two lakes. The surface of Opawica Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.  Geography  This lake has a length of , a maximum width of and an altitude of . The shape of the lake resembles an ax whose sharp part is oriented towards the North. Opawaca Island (length: , almost round shape) is located in western part of the lac. The size of this island with a mountain peak of significantly reduces the water surface of this part of the lake. The eastern part of the lake that stretches out at is narrow and elongated and collects the waters of Dalime Creek (from the North). Gabriel Lake is the source of the Opawica River, which flows northwest into a succession of rapids. The Opawica River from the East first crosses Lichen Lake and Wachigabau Lake, then flows into Lake Opawica via two points of entry, which are located at each end of Gull Island (length: ; width: ). This island and the two peninsulas (one extending westward on from the east shore, and the other from the west stretching on ) form a strip of land of in length that runs the full length of the Canadian National Railway. The mouth of Opawica Lake has a dam and is located at the bottom of a bay north of the western part of the lake, at: * South of the mouth of the Opawica River; * northeast of Lake Waswanipi; * south of the village center of Waswanipi; * east of the mouth of Goéland Lake (Waswanipi River); * south-east of the mouth of the Nottaway River; * east of downtown Matagami; * south-west of downtown Chibougamau.Distances from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Department of Natural Resources Canada. The main hydrographic slopes near Opawica Lake are: *North side: Opawica River, Chibougamau River, Waswanipi River; *East side: Opawica River; *South side: Wachigabau Lake, Opawica River, Lichen Lake, Nicobi River; *West side: Bachelor River, Lake Waswanipi. From the dam at the mouth of Opawica Lake, the course of the Opawica River flows over first to the northeast to a river bend, then northwesterly to its confluence with the Chibougamau River. This confluence of these two rivers becomes the head of the Waswanipi River.

Following their promotion in the previous season this was their first season back in the highest tier of Swiss football.  Overview  Claude Andrey was the Basel trainer for the second consecutive season. After gaining promotion during the last season, the club's priority aim was to remain in the top flight of Swiss football. The season started very badly, the team lost four of the first six games and they did not record a win until the 9th round. After the first half of the Qualifying Phase, Basel and Young Boys were joint bottom of the league table with just six points. During their eleven games Basel had suffered six defeats and four draws. To this point they had scored just six goals, four of which were in the home win against Luzern, but had conceded only nine. The second half of the Qualifying Phase was better and Basel rose to 7th position in the league table. During the entire phase Basel scored just 18 goals, thus being the poorest attacking team and conceded just 15, thus being the defensive best in the league. Basel were qualified for the Champions Round. Here things started better, three wins in the first three games. But two back to back dubbings in Lugano (1–4) as guests to Xamax (1–5), as well as the return game home defeat against Lugano, put an end to the hopes of a higher placed finish.

Upstream large patches of isolated forests and dried lake beds are adjacent to the course of seasonal Sahibi near the villages of Bolni, Bidawas, Jhabuwa, Jat Bhagola, Ajarka, Manethi, Karni Kot and Neemrana, which could be made perennial with excess water thus creating an interconnected- wetlands based eco-corridor in the Delhi Supergroup of Aravalli range from Sariska Tiger Reserve to various nature and national parks of Delhi Ridge up to the national capital of New Delhi.

History  The town's name derives from the railway station name assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 30 January 1928, which was an Aboriginal word meaning either pine tree or copper. Many Peaks Provisional School opened on 23 Oct 1922 as part of the railway construction camp (57 Mile Camp) for the Gladstone to Monto railway line. In 1923 it was relocated south to the 63 Mile Camp. In 1926 it moved south to 67 Mile Camp and was renamed Barrimoon Provisional School (Barrimoon being the name of the railway station there). In 1927 it moved again to 74 Mile Camp and its name was changed in 19228 to Kalpowar Provisional School. In 1929 it moved to 82 Mile Camp and in September 1930 it was renamed Bancroft Provisional School. On 1 August 1931 it became Bancroft State School and remained there permanently until its closer on 31 December 1998.

Jagannatha Rao under the S.V.S. Films banner and directed by K. Viswanath. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Savitri, Vijaya Nirmala in the lead roles and music jointly composed by T. V. Raju & Vijaya Krishna Murthy. A few of the scenes in the film are replicated in Swayamkrushi (1987), which was also directed by K. Viswanath. Plot The film begins on Ramu (N. T. Rama Rao) a good samaritan, the owner of a pan shop. Nevertheless, being illiterate he holds a high intellect. The people in the colony idolizes him apart from a local goon Gangulu (Satyanarayana) In his front lives a beautiful girl Subbulu one that endears him. Parallelly, Ramu rears and civilizes his cousin Vani (Lakshmi) aspires to marry her. Incognizant of it, Vani loves her classmate Ravi (Chandra Mohan), son of a Zamindar Janaki Ramayya (Mikkilineni). Indeed, Janaki Ramayya has two sons, the elder one Raghu (M. Balaiah) is docile, whereas Ravi prodigal, due to the pampering of virago mother Kanaka Durga (Chhaya Devi). Since Raghu is the step-son of her, she scorns on him. Besides, another story runs, Kodanla Rao (Gummadi) a court clerk aims to crave his daughter Sridevi (Savitri) an advocate for which he strives and succeeds. Meanwhile, monitoring Ravi's attitude Janaki Ramayya empowers the entire to Raghu which begrudges Kanaka Durga. At the same time, Kondala Rao moves to Raghu with the marriage proposal of Sridevi when Raghu denounces the integrity of the scholarly women. At that moment, enraged Kondala Rao revolts against Raghu. Exploiting it, Kanaka Durga eliminates Raghu through Gangulu. Right now, Kondala Rao is accused and Sridevi defends when overwhelmed Kondala Rao passes away. Soon after, Sridevi learns Subbulu as her cousin, so, she reaches her but hides her discipline and behaves like an ignorant. After some time, Vani returns, affirms her choice when Ramu sacrifices his love and performs her espousal with Ravi. Later, Ramu couple up with Sridevi and gets her true identity when he makes her a good practitioner. Eventually, rift arises Ravi & Vani by overbearing of each other, as a result, Vani quits the house. Thereupon, Ramu & Sridevi makes her realize the mistake. Simultaneously, conflict arises between Janaki Ramayya & Ravi too, regarding the property. The same night, Gangulu makes a robbery in their house and slaughters Janaki Ramayya in which Ravi is indicted. At present, Sridevi picks up the case and Ramu digs out the reality. In that process, Subbulu sacrifices her life while guarding Ramu against harm. At last, Ravi is acquitted. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note. Cast *N. T.

This protocol was proposed by Feng Hao, Peter Ryan, and Piotr Zieliński in 2010. It extends Hao and Zieliński's anonymous veto network protocol by allowing each participant to count the number of veto votes (i.e., input one in a boolean-OR function) while preserving the anonymity of those who have voted. The protocol can be generalized to support a wider range of inputs beyond just the binary values 0 and 1. Description All participants agree on a group \\\\scriptstyle G with a generator \\\\scriptstyle g of prime order \\\\scriptstyle q in which the discrete logarithm problem is hard. For example, a Schnorr group can be used. Assume there are \\\\scriptstyle n participants. Unlike other secure multi-party computation protocols that typically require pairwise secret and authenticated channels between participants in addition to an authenticated public channel, OV-net only requires an authenticated public channel available to every participant. Such a channel may be realized by using digital signatures. The protocol runs in two rounds. Round 1: each participant \\\\scriptstyle i selects a random value \\\\scriptstyle x_i \\\\,\\\\in_R\\\\, \\\\mathbb{Z}_q and publishes the ephemeral public key \\\\scriptstyle g^{x_i} together with a zero-knowledge proof for the proof of the knowledge of the exponent \\\\scriptstyle x_i. Such proofs may be realized by using Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs as described in RFC 8235. After this round, each participant computes: :g^{y_i} = \\\\prod_{ji} g^{x_j} Round 2: each participant \\\\scriptstyle i publishes \\\\scriptstyle g^{x_i y_i}g^{v_i} where \\\\scriptstyle v_i is either 0 or 1, together with a 1-out- of-2 zero knowledge proof for the proof that \\\\scriptstyle v_i is one of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}. Such 1-out-of-2 proofs may be realized by using Cramer, Gennaro, and Schoenmakers' zero-knowledge proof technique. After round 2, each participant computes \\\\scriptstyle \\\\prod_i g^{x_i y_i}g^{v_i} = g^{\\\\sum_i v_i}. Note that all \\\\scriptstyle x_i values vanish because \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sum_i {x_i y_i} = 0. The exponent \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sum_i v_i represents the count of ones. As it is usually a small number, the count can be computed by exhaustive search. Overall, the 2-round efficiency is the theoretically best possible. In terms of the computational load and bandwidth usage, OV-net is also the most efficient among related techniques. Maximum secrecy The OV-net protocol guarantees the secrecy of an input bit unless all other input bits are known. The protection of secrecy is the maximum since when all other bits are known, the remaining bit can always be computed by subtracting the values of known input bits from the output of the boolean- count function. Applications A straightforward application of OV-net is to build a boardroom voting system, where the election is run by voters themselves. For a single candidate election, each voter sends either \\"No\\" or \\"Yes\\", which correspond to 0 and 1. Every voter, as well as an observer, can tally the \\"Yes\\" votes by themselves without needing any tallying authority. There are standard methods to extend a single-candidate election to support multiple candidates. A straightforward method is to run the single-candidate election in parallel for multiple candidates, and each voter casts \\"Yes/No\\" to each of the candidates. Additional zero-knowledge proofs are needed if the voter is limited to vote for only one candidate. Another method is to modify the encoding of candidates: instead of using 0 and 1 for \\"No\\" and \\"Yes\\" in a single-candidate election, encode each candidate with a unique number such that the tally for each candidate can be unambiguously computed. In this case, a more general 1-out-of-n zero-knowledge proof is used instead where n is the number of candidates. Implementation A prototype implementation of OV-net was presented by McCorry, Shahandashti, and Hao at Financial Cryptography'17 as a smart contract over Ethereum's blockchain. The source code is publicly available. This implementation forms part of the Newcastle University team's solution on \\"Removing Trusted Tallying Authorities: Self-Enforcing E-Voting over Ethereum\\", which was awarded third place in the 2016 Economist Cybersecurity Challenge jointly organized by The Economist and Kaspersky Lab.

Mother Goose Club episodes are also available on Netflix and Prime Video. The show is made up of a series of educational live-action, with a cast of six recurring characters who introduce classic nursery rhymes to children through catchy tunes, play and interactive lessons. An emphasis on words helps young children learn early language skills while rhymes and melodies encourage song participation and physical movement. The live-action characters are set against animated backdrops which often reinforce early learning concepts such as letters, colors and shape recognition.  Production  The show was created by educators and parents of four, Harry Jho and Sona Jho of Sockeye Media. Mother Goose Club videos were initially uploaded to YouTube for the purpose of sharing content with industry professionals, but subsequently developed an unexpectedly large following among the general population. Mother Goose Club cast and creators By 2011, Mother Goose Club had inadvertently become one of the largest YouTube kids’ channels in the world. The show aims to promote early literacy through the recitation and singing of nursery rhymes. Starting in 2016, Sockeye Media began presenting the Mother Goose Club series at both MipJunior and MipCom, international conferences that bring together entertainment content players worldwide. In 2017, Sockeye Media together with developer Story Toys Entertainment (now Touch Press Inc.) created an app that brings together Mother Goose Club books, videos and games to iOS mobile devices. In June 2017, Sockeye Media announced its partnership with DHX Media’s online kids' network WildBrain for managing Mother Goose Club's YouTube channels and handling paid media campaigns. The deal aims to increase audiences and ad revenue by providing rights management and access to technical support. A new 52 x 11’ series featuring CGI-animated Mother Goose Club characters with a story-driven narrative began development in 2018.  Reception and achievements  Available across multiple media platforms, this hybrid series has acquired over 6 billion views and more than 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube. Its most popular video, Itsy Bitsy Spider, has more than 22 million views on YouTube.

The 11th Army was a field army of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War, which fought on the Caspian-Caucasian Front. It took a prominent part in the sovietization of the three republics of the southern Caucasus in 1920–21, when Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia were brought within the orbit of Soviet Russia. Russian Civil War Since the Russian Republic's Caucasus Front (April 1917 - March 1918) dissolved, it did not have a true successor organization. The Army of the North Caucasus, which was renamed 11th Army on October 3, 1918, constituted the main army of the Russian Republic in the area during the Russian Civil War. During the Russian Civil War the 11th Army fought against the White troops of General Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army in the western part of the North Caucasus. It was the main strength of the Caspian-Caucasian Army Group. In January 1919, the front of 200 miles held by the Red troops along the Caucasus foothills and South Russian steppes was cut into two by the White forces in the Northern Caucasus Operation (1918–1919), which resulted in the panic flight of the 11th Red Army.Evan Mawdsley (2007), The Russian Civil War, p. 161. Pegasus Books, On 27 April 1920 the 11th Army took Baku and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic collapsed. The Bolsheviks then established the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, as a Soviet republic in May 1920. This was the first country in the South Caucasus that the Bolsheviks seized control of. Taking advantage of its quarrels with neighboring Armenia, the 11th Army had little difficulty in initially sovietizing Azerbaijan. Although it soon was embroiled in a fierce anti-Soviet insurgency, the army remained poised to advance into the two remaining republics, Armenian and Georgia. For the time being, however, the authorities in Moscow ordered the army to stand down while negotiations between Russia and Armenia were being carried out.Hovannisian. The Republic of Armenia, pp. 62–63 In that brief span the Red Army did aid Armenian communists fighting against the Armenian government in the Ijevan region of Armenia. In September-November 1920 Armenia and in February-March 1921, Georgia were invaded and brought under Bolshevik control. Having conquered the whole of Transcaucasia, the 11th Army was dissolved on May 29, 1921 and replaced by the Independent Caucasus Army.  Commanders  The commanders of the Army of the North Caucasus were : * Alexei Ivanovich Avtonomov (25 January - 28 May 1918) * Karl Kalnin (28 May - 2 August 1918), * Ivan Sorokin (3 August - 3 October 1918) The head of the 11th Army's Revolutionary Military Council was Sergo Ordzhonikidze. The military leaders of the 11th Army were * Ivan Sorokin (3 - 27 October 1918) * Ivan Fedko (17 - 30 November 1918) * Vladimir Kruse (30 November 1918 - 3 January 1919) * Mikhail Levandovsky (3 January - 13 February 1919) * N.A. Żdanow (20 March - 3 June 1919) * A. Smirnow (3 - 10 June 1919) * V.P. Raspopov (14 August — 26 September 1919), * J.P.

It is the most significant castle in the canton. History During the High Middle Ages the area around Oberurnen was owned by Schänis Abbey and paid taxes to Säckingen Abbey. In 1264 the Habsburgs inherited the bailiwick of Glarus from the Counts of Kyburg. About two decades later, in 1288, Säckingen Abbey granted them a fief over the abbey's lands as well. To consolidate their control over Glarus, the Habsburgs built Näfels Castle and probably also built or expanded Vorburg. By about 1300 the castle was a Habsburg administrative center. In the mid-14th century it was the residence of the Austrian Habsburg Vogt Hermann von Landenberg. In 1351 Glarus rebelled against the Habsburgs and attacked and destroyed Näfels Castle. They may have also attacked Vorburg, though there are no surviving records of the this. The castle was probably expanded after the destruction of Näfels, either by the Habsburgs or Glarus. In 1369 it appears in a document when a Rudolf Stucki pledged the castle as collateral. In 1386 it was mentioned as a refuge castle and was probably not regularly inhabited. In the 15th century it was abandoned and fell into ruin. Many of the stones show evidence of a large fire in the castle, but whether it was an accident or due to an attack is unknown. The north west wall of the tower was repaired and preserved during the 19th century. In 1940 the south ring wall was excavated and stabilized. An archeological excavation in 1970 discovered traces of an outbuilding as well as a layer of animal bones. Castle site The ruins sit on a hill north of the village of Oberurnen. The north-west wall of the palas rise about above the ground. The palas was a rectangle of with walls that are about thick. The walls are made of roughly finished and squared limestone blocks with more carefully finished bossage stones at the corners. A newer wall connects the palas with a residential wing on the eastern side. South and west of the palas, a narrow zwinger and two ditches protected the castle. Traces of the foundations of a bridge over the north side of the inner ditch are still visible. The gatehouse was probably on the north side of the ring wall. The palas was probably built at the end of the 13th century, while the ring wall, zwinger and other out buildings are from the early 14th.

It is one of about 40 public colleges of education in Ghana.National Accreditation Board, Ghana - Public Colleges of Education The college participated in the DFID-funded T-TEL programme.  History  The college was established with a higher intake of male students on 7 February 1952. The pioneer intake was 30 male students. The Presbyterian Church was then in control of management with the late the late Rev. H. T. Dako serving as the appointed Principal. On 9 November 1953, the name of the college was changed to Techiman Training College – Abetifi, because it was initially planned to be sited at Techiman in the Brong Ahafo Region. Attempts were made to relocate the college, but in 1962, a final decision was made to retain the college at Abetifi. The college was therefore renamed Abetifi Training College. In 1995, the name of the college was changed to Abetifi Presby Training College, but retained its Acronym ABETICO, and its motto “GO FORTH AND SHINE”. The college was originally started as men's training college and its emplacement was in the Abetifi town in rented buildings. Two elders Opanin Addo Bruce and Yaw Tawiah (both deceased) gave out their buildings to house the college. A new site was acquired for the college through Nana Adontenhene of Kwahu and indigenes of the Abetifi township. Later, a six-unit classroom was constructed for the college. From that commencement, the college has risen to its present position in terms of infrastructure. The college initially offered the two-year Teacher's Cert ‘B’ course until 1963 when it was replaced with the Certificate ‘A’ – 4-year course. The phasing out of some teacher-training colleges in the country during 1973/74 academic year necessitated the re-location of students from Anum and Wiawso Training Colleges to Abetifi Presbyterian College of Education (ABETICO) During 1974/75 academic year, seventy men were admitted for the first time to the College's two-year post-secondary teacher-training course. Among this batch of students was Rev. Herbert Anim Oppong (former Clerk of General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana). Following a decision to turn the college into a Teachers’ Resource Centre, no more students were admitted into the college during 1975 through to 1976 and 1976 through to 1977 academic years. Abetifi College of Education later became a co-educational institution during the 1977/78 academic year when the first batch of female students was admitted into the college. The college admitted blind students in the 1982/83 academic year. This was followed by the introduction of the 2-year modular teacher- training course in 1984/85. Both courses were phased out by the end of the 1990/91 academic year. At the beginning of the 1987/88 academic year as part of the 1987 New Educational Reforms, the college admitted students to start the Teacher's certificate ‘A’ 3-year post-secondary training programme, with the first batch graduating in 1991. The college offers the 3-year Diploma in Basic Education Course. The programme was started during the 2004/2005 academic year and the first batch of 225 students who completed their course in July 2007. Abetifi College of education is one of the oldest teacher training college of education celebrating it 55th Anniversary in 2007. Since its inception in 1952, the college has turned out 5,662 trained-teachers of different categories for the educational enterprises of the country.

Early life She was the daughter of the former Mary Churchill and Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, MP for Cambridge and Master of the Mint. Among her siblings were Henry Cadogan (who was killed at the Battle of Vitoria), George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan, and Lady Emily Cadogan (who married Gerald Valerian Wellesley, a brother of her first husband, both sons of Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington). Her father's first wife, the former Hon. Frances Bromley (a daughter of Henry Bromley, 1st Baron Montfort) and from that marriage, she had several older half-siblings, including Charles Cadogan, 2nd Earl Cadogan, Rev. William Cadogan, Thomas Cadogan (a naval officer lost at sea aboard HMS Glorieux), and George Cadogan (who was killed in India while an officer in the HEIC Army). Her father was the only son of Charles Cadogan, 2nd Baron Cadogan and the former Elizabeth Sloane (the second daughter of Sir Hans Sloane, 1st Baronet). Her maternal grandparents were Charles Churchill, MP for Stockbridge and Great Marlow, and the former Lady Mary Walpole (a daughter of Prime Minister Robert Walpole, later the 1st Earl of Orford). Her mother was a niece of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. In 1800, her father was raised to the peerage as the first Earl Cadogan, and Charlotte was afforded the courtesy title of Lady Charlotte as the daughter of an Earl. Personal life On 20 September 1803, Lady Charlotte was married to Henry Wellesley, the fifth and youngest son of Garret Wellesley, 1st Earl of Mornington and the Hon. Anne Hill-Trevor (eldest daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon). He was the younger brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley and William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington. Together, they were the parents of four children: * Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley (1804–1884), who married the Hon. Olivia Cecilia FitzGerald, a daughter of the 20th Baroness de Ros and Lord Henry FitzGerald (fourth son of the 1st Duke of Leinster). * Captain Hon.

It was claimed that Paget had pursued her ruthlessly and that she had asked her husband to stay close to her in public \\"for the express purpose of avoiding Lord P's importunities\\". At the divorce trial, several witnesses stated that the couple had an affectionate relationship. Charlotte's brother Henry Cadogan challenged Paget to a duel; honour was satisfied, though neither was injured. Following the divorce, Wellesley was awarded £24,000 in damages against Paget. Referring to the incident in later years, when Paget, now Lord Uxbridge, was assigned to Wellington as his second-in-command at the Battle of Waterloo, Wellington is said to have commented: \\"Lord Uxbridge has the reputation of running away with everybody he can. I’ll take good care he don’t run away with me.” In 1810, following Paget's divorce by his wife Caroline, Lady Charlotte and Paget were married. Together, Charlotte and her second husband had ten children, of whom seven survived infancy, including: * Lady Emily Caroline Paget (1810–1893), who married John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney. * Admiral Lord Sir Clarence Edward Paget (1811–1895), who married Martha Stuart, the youngest daughter of Admiral Sir Robert Otway. * Lady Mary Paget (1812–1859), who married John Montagu, 7th Earl of Sandwich. * General Lord Alfred Henry Paget (1816–1888), MP for Lichfield who married Cecilia Wyndham, second daughter and co-heiress of George Thomas Wyndham of Cromer Hall. * General Lord George Augustus Frederick Paget (1818–1880), who married his first cousin Agnes Charlotte, daughter of Sir Arthur Paget. After her death, he married Louisa Elizabeth Heneage, daughter of Charles Fieschi Heneage. After he died in 1880, his widow remarried to Arthur Capell, 6th Earl of Essex. * Lady Adelaide Paget (1820–1890), who married Frederick William Cadogan, a son of George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan.

Brand was born on 17 September 1749, the eldest son of Thomas Brand of The Hoo, Kimpton, Hertfordshire and his wife Lady Caroline Pierrepont daughter of Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull. He was educated at Westminster School in 1764 and was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge on 19 January 1765. In August 1770 he succeeded his father to The Hoo. He married Gertrude Roper, daughter of Charles Roper on 20 April 1771. Brand's estate extended into Cambridgeshire and he tried to enter Parliament in 1770 at Cambridgeshire in a by-election, but he was dismissed as an outsider, and withdrew before the poll, receiving £1,000 compensation from Sir Sampson Gideon, Bt. At the 1774 general election Brand was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Arundel on the interest of the Duke of Norfolk. There is no record of his having spoken in the House, and he did not stand in 1780. He stood for Cambridgeshire at a by-election in 1789 but there was such support for his opponent James Whorwood Adeane, that he withdrew before the poll. Brand died on 21 February 1794. His wife Gertrude succeeded her brother Trevor as Baroness Dacre on 4 July 1794 and was succeeded firstly by their eldest son Thomas and then by their second son Henry Otway. They also had a daughter Gertrude.

In the 2018/19 academic year, 350 people enrolled on the B.Ed. degree programme.  History  Enchi College of Education was established in 1965 as a male institution and became co-educational a decade later with the admission of thirty-five women in 1975. It re-located to its present site in 1978. Enchi College started with 4-year post middle Teacher's Certificate ‘A’ programme. The college is located at the district capital of the Aowin-Suaman District Assembly in the Western Region. The original campus was sited at the southern end of the town, now being used as the Brentu Secondary Technical School. The first principal was Mr. Addisson. The college was converted into a three-year post secondary teacher training college in 1988. The college's 40 years of existence so far has been marked by a number of achievements. With an initial enrolment of 70 students and 9 academic staff, the college now had a total enrolment of four hundred and fifty trainees made up of 350 men and 100 women. The teaching staff of 39 is made up of 3 females and 32 males. The college has 49 non-teaching staff. In the 2002/2003 academic year, the University of Education, Winneba, chose the college as the Western Regional Centre for the Distance Education Programme to prepare certificate ‘A’ teachers for Diploma in Basic Education. In October 2004, the college started the three-year Diploma in Basic Education programme. It is currently running the Untrained Teachers Diploma in Basic Education (UTDBE) programme alongside its regular programme. The college has been able to produce over 2,500 teachers, most of whom are currently occupying very enviable positions in the country. Despite its busy teaching lessons and practice schedule, there are still many ways for students to get involve in extra-curricula activities.

One of the host cities, Palembang, hosted the women's event, while the men's matches are played in Bekasi, Cibinong, Cikarang, and Soreang. The Games' main stadium, the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, Jakarta did not host the football events. The stadium hosted the ceremonies and the athletics. All the top 20 nations sent their national football teams to the Asian Games excluding India. A total of 25 men's team and 11 women's team competed at the Asian Games. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) refused to clear the Indian football team to participate in the tournament due its policy of only sending national teams that were ranked among the top eight at the continental level (India were ranked 14th at the time in Asia). The decision was opposed by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) who described the IOA as lacking \\"vision and competence\\", and that the IOA did not consider the recent form and upwards movement of the Indian national football team in FIFA World Rankings. This was the first time that the Indian football team did not participate in the tournament since the 1994 Asian Games. Several nations also refused to participate most notably including Tajikistan, Maldives, Yemen and Lebanon; the latter two teams will participate in 2019 AFC Asian Cup.

She is the commander of Inferno Squad, a group of elite Imperial soldiers, but near the end of the Galactic Civil War becomes disillusioned with the Galactic Empire's actions and defects to the Rebel Alliance. Iden is the player character of the 2017 video game Star Wars Battlefront II, an action shooter developed by EA DICE, in collaboration with Criterion Games and Motive Studios. She serves as the protagonist of the game's campaign and is voiced and portrayed via motion capture by Janina Gavankar. Development and design Janina Gavankar voiced and portrayed Iden Versio Battlefront IIs campaign narrative and characters, including Iden, were developed by Electronic Arts's Motive Studios branch. Iden Versio is voiced and portrayed through motion capture by actress and musician Janina Gavankar. On the motion capture aspect of her performance, Gavankar commented \\"The technology has caught up so much that you can deliver a subtle performance and it will catch your micro-expressions [...] I decided to deliver as subtle of a performance as I would on camera. During her audition process for the game, Gavanakar was not told that the project she was auditioning for was Battlefront II nor that she was auditioning for the lead role, but noted that her knowledge of the gaming industry assisted her in \\"[putting] two and two together.\\" She commented that \\"I just got an audition and it said [...] EA Motive. When you send someone like me, who is a hardcore gamer, an audition like this, I knew exactly what it was. I knew that if it was Motive that it was Battlefront.\\" Gavankar commented that the development process for Iden was highly collaborative. She detailed that she \\"worked with the writers of the game and the writer of the book and we had access to a LucasFilm story group member every day on set. We really found out who [Iden] was together. We worked with military consultants to figure out how we moved together as a squad; all of these things took a lot of care and conversation.\\" Steve Blank, a creative executive for Lucasfilm described Iden as a \\"tried and true and through and through Imperial.\\" Gavankar detailed Iden as having an \\"unshaking loyalty to the Empire\\" as a result of her early life upbringing to be \\"the perfect soldier, the perfect officer.\\" She commented that Iden \\"is a literal poster child for the Empire. Her father is an Admiral and her mother is a propaganda artist. She actually put Iden in posters.\\" Gavankar added that \\"all the way up until the moment [the player begins Battlefront II], [Iden's] story has been dark, dark, dark side.\\" Despite this, Iden's characterization has been described as \\"grey\\" and \\"complex\\", due to events that unfold in Battlefront II. VentureBeat details that that complexity drew Gavankar to the role. Gavanakar also detailed that even though Iden defects to the Rebellion, she still misses the order, cleanliness, and respect that the Empire carried itself with. Appearances Novels Iden Versio debuted in Star Wars Battlefront II: Inferno Squad, a tie-in novel for the 2017 Battlefront II video game. The Inferno Squad novel was written by Christie Golden and released on July 25, 2017. Gavankar provided the voice for the novel's audiobook version. The novel's events directly precede those of the video game. In the novel, the \\"Inferno Squad\\" is an elite team of soldiers led by Commander Iden Versio. In-universe, the group's formation is authorized by the Empire after the Rebellion steals the plans to the Death Star and destroys the battle station. The Inferno Squad is tasked with infiltrating and eliminating \\"the Dreamers\\", who were the remainder of Saw Gerrera's extremist rebel group, the Partisans. In Inferno Squad, the unit is established with Iden commanding Gideon Hask, a fellow pilot who graduated top of his class at Coruscant Imperial University, Del Meeko, a TIE fighter pilot and an engineering expert, and Seyn Marana, an intelligence prodigy and master cryptologist. Iden is also noted for holding the record for most verified kills in battle. In the novel, Admiral Garrick Versio serves as the squad's supervisor. Video games =Battlefront II= Iden Versio's first video game appearance was in Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), where she is portrayed by Janina Gavankar. She is the protagonist of the game's single-player campaign, and she is also a playable character in game's multiplayer mode. In the video game's campaign, she is established as the Commander of Inferno Squad, an Imperial Special Forces unit. Gavankar also described Inferno Squad as a black ops unit. Her Inferno Squad mates in the game are Gideon Hask and Del Meeko. Throughout the game, Iden Versio is accompanied by ID10, a seeker droid which she nicknames Dio. TJ Ramini, Del Meeko's voice actor, notes that Iden and Del \\"have a bit of a banter, a bit of a laugh,\\" throughout the game. After being freed from Rebel captivity by ID10, the player first controls Iden on Endor during the events of Return of the Jedi. Iden leads Inferno Squad against the Rebellion in the Battle of Endor, during which they witness the destruction of the second Death Star. Iden then meets with her father, Admiral Garrick Versio and the two receive orders from a now deceased Emperor Palpatine in the form of a hologram recording. One of Palpatine's posthumous orders is for the Empire to perform Operation: Cinder, which involved devastating many Imperial planets in order to instill fear in the galaxy and emphasize the Empire's authority. One of the planets targeted by Operation: Cinder is Iden's homeworld of Vardos. Inferno Squad is sent to Vardos to retrieve Gleb, an Imperial ally, so that she is not caught in the destruction of Vardos. Iden ideologically disagrees with Operation: Cinder, as it conflicts with Iden's belief that the Empire stands for peace and order. As a result of her internal conflict with Operation: Cinder, Iden disobeys Imperial commands to not rescue civilians, and she defects from the Empire. Del Meeko joins Iden, while Hask remains loyal to the Empire. Following her defection from the Empire, the player continues to control Iden, who briefly was unaligned, but soon joins the in- universe Rebellion movement. Toward the end of the game's campaign, Iden participates in the Battle of Jakku, the final large-scale military battle of the in-universe Galactic Civil War. The player controls Iden as she assists the Rebellion in defeating the Empire. During the battle, Iden engages - and bests - Hask in a dogfight and confronts her father on his ship as it is being destroyed by Rebel fire. She pleads with him to follow her to safety, but he refuses and urges her to survive. Following the Rebellion's victory, she begins a romantic relationship with her Inferno Squad partner, Del Meeko. Nearly 30 years pass, and in the campaign's epilogue, it is revealed that Iden and Del have married and had a daughter. The campaign ends with a cliffhanger after Hask, now aligned with the First Order kills Del. Battlefront II: Resurrection Iden returns in the Star Wars Battlefront II: Resurrection downloadable content (DLC). Mitch Dyer, the co-writer of Battlefront II details that \\"when the Resurrection DLC begins, [...] Iden is in a time of peace. The galaxy is at peace — there is no war.\\" While the initial Battlefront II campaign features chapters in which the player controls other characters like Luke Skywalker or Lando Calrissian, the Resurrection DLC focuses entirely on Iden. Dyer commented that this is because \\"one of the key pieces of feedback [the development team] got was that people really liked playing as Iden. She's an interesting and compelling new character in the Star Wars universe, so we wanted to really focus the rest of the story on her.\\" Iden and Del's daughter is revealed to be named Zay in Resurrection. Toward the end of the Resurrection DLC, while infiltrating Hask's First Order Star Destroyer with her daughter Zay and her partner Shriv, Iden Versio steals the plans for a First Order dreadnought. Iden confronts and kills Hask but is mortally wounded in the process, and dies before she can escape the Star Destroyer, although Zay, Dio and Shriv manage to get away on a stolen TIE Fighter and send the dreadnought plans to General Leia Organa's Resistance movement. Leia then sends the trio to gather the Resistance's allies in the Outer Rim. Toys A LEGO minifigure version of Versio is also available in the LEGO Star Wars Inferno Squad Battle Pack, which was released in early 2019.https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/inferno-squad-battle-pack-75226 An expansion to Fantasy Flight's Star Wars Legion, includes and Iden Versio miniature and cards to include her in standard play.https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2019/12/12/covert-ops/ Reception The character of Iden Versio received mixed opinions. In a review of the Inferno Squad novel, Sean Keane of New York Daily News wrote that \\"We get POV sections from all four members of the squad, but Iden is by far the most developed. She's a great lead and the novel highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the idealized Imperial upbringing. She is a talented soldier, but struggles with emotion and attachment.\\" In his review of Star Wars Battlefront II, Bryan Bishop of The Verge praised Janina Gavankar's performance, opining that she \\"delivers some real pathos with her performance.\\" Bishop added, \\"[Iden] may be an Imperial, but she's also a hero in the classic Star Wars tradition: she fights for the ideals that have been instilled in her from birth, and carries with her the kind of devil-may-care swagger that made Han Solo a household name.\\" Tom Hoggins of The Telepgraph wrote that Gavankar joined an \\"exclusive club of women leading Star Wars stories, with Iden Versio standing alongside Daisy [Ridley]'s Rey and Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso from Rogue One.\\" In a negative review of Resurrection, Hayden Dingman of PCWorld opines that the setup to the DLC is promising due to the believability of Iden's stakes in comparison with the main campaign and the built-in emotional hook of Del Meeko's death, \\"compounded by Iden fighting alongside her daughter Zay.\\" Dingman, however, added that \\"Battlefront IIs campaign, proper ending included, is anemic start to finish. Just so much wasted potential. I don't know whether blame lies with Disney or with EA and DICE, but the developers had an amazing character in Iden Versio and did nothing with her.\\" Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer had similar sentiments, commenting that \\"most of the tension is removed from the story\\" once \\"Iden Versio and her comrade, Del, basically join the Rebellion.\\" Roberts criticized the lack of exploration of Iden's Imperial perspective, commenting that \\"in the opening, [the player gets] the sense that Iden and company believe in the sense of order that the Empire brings—but their perspective isn't explored with much greater depth than that. When they turn against the Empire, as the Empire turns on its own people, they make the snap decision to change sides with very little ambiguity.\\" References External links * * Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional aviators Category:Fictional commanders Category:Fictional defectors Category:Fictional revolutionaries Category:Fictional special forces personnel Category:Fictional war veterans Category:Soldiers in science fiction Category:Star Wars video game characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 2017 Category:Video game protagonists Category:Woman soldier and warrior characters in video games ","title":"Iden Versio"},{"id":"56154258","text":"Dharmavaram is a village in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

Education  The college offers a general education programme and an early childhood programme. In 2016, 344 student teachers matriculated into the Diploma in Basic Education programme.  History  Holy Child College of Education was originally opened in 1946 in Cape Coast before moving to its current site nine years later. Holy Child College was originally established in 1946 in Cape Coast to offer the Post-Primary Certificate ‘A’ course. In 1950, A post-Secondary department was added to be followed in 1952 by the two-year Certificate ‘B’ course which was introduced as part of the Government's Accelerated Development Plan. On 18 February 1955 the college was moved to its present site on the top of Fijai Hill where it shares boundaries with Kweikuma, Archbishop Porter Girls Secondary School and Fijai Senior High School. At the time of relocation, the college was known as Adiembra Training College. The name was changed to Holy Child College derived from the Holy Child Community. The college was expanded to offer an additional course – the two-year post Certificate ‘B’, bringing the number of courses being offered at the time to four. In 1960, the Certificate ‘B’ course was stopped as a policy, thus allowing for substantial increases to be made in the enrolment figures for the other courses. In 1963, the college started a special Home Science bias four-year course aimed at producing teachers for Home Science Centres throughout the country. This course was stopped by a Government's decision in 1969 to be replaced by a two-year specialist course. In 1974, a two-year Vocational/Specialist course was introduced, which was also stopped as a government policy, in 1976. Following the recommendations made by the Dzobo Committee on Education reform, a 3-year Post Secondary Certificate ‘A’ course was started aimed at producing teachers for proposed Junior Secondary Schools. Various factors militated against the success of this course which was discontinued in August, 1979. A new Post-Secondary course structure was then drawn up to enable some kind of specialization, and this college was selected to offer Home Science. The Certificate ‘A’ 4-year Post-Middle course was re- introduced in September 1981. The college ran vacation classes under the modular teacher training programme. Holy Child College was under the headship of the Sisters of the Order of the Holy Child Jesus until 1982. The first substantive principal of the college was Mother Mary Joachim, who assumed duty in January, 1956. Mother Mary Edwin who acted as principal pending Mother Joachim's arrival became Vice Principal. At that time, the staff numbered nine. The college has produced a significant number of women teachers who are found functioning actively not only in the basic schools, but also in secondary and tertiary institutions. In other educational establishments some of them occupy high executive positions. Currently, the college runs a 3-year Diploma in Basic education (DBE) course for regular students. It also runs sandwich courses for untrained teachers and serving Certificate ‘A’ teachers, all leading to the award of Diploma in Basic Education. {  +Principals of the college since 1956 are: !Name !Years served - Mother Mary Joachim 1956 to 1961 - Mother Mary Colum 1961 to 1967 - Sister Kathleen Marine 1967 to 1973 - Sister Mary Anita 1973 to 1981 - Mrs. Lucy Peprah Tawiah 1982 to 1986 - Mrs. Mabel A.

In a break with tradition, no new doll of First Lady Branstad was created in 2014 to mark the election. It had been traditional that a doll of each of Iowa's 41 first ladies, wearing their inaugural gowns, be created and displayed Iowa State Capitol. The dolls, which are now a tourist attraction, was started by Branstad's predecessor, Billie Ray, during the 1970s. Governor Terry Branstad became the longest serving state governor in U.S. history in 2015. Likewise, Christine Branstad also holds the record as the longest serving state first lady in history as well. Christine Branstad's tenure as first lady ended in 2017, following 22 years and 8,169 days in office, when Governor Terry Branstad resigned from office to become the United States Ambassador to China. She was succeeded by First Gentleman Kevin Reynolds, the first man to hold the position in Iowa's history.

History  The College was founded in October 1963. Miss Martha Baehler was the Principal of the college and had an initial staff of six. Eighty female students were admitted to pursue the four-year post middle course. In the early years the staff and students had to contend with the problem of inadequate accommodation. An administration block was built for the college in 1966. Work on a dormitory block and a classroom block started in 1965. By the 1966/67 academic year the college had a total enrolment of about 200. The accommodation problem was still prevalent. Only 3 of the 16 staff were resident on the compound. The crowning moment of the early years of struggle for the establishment of a future great College came with the holding of a Commendation Service for the first batch of students to pass out at Kibi Presbyterian Church with the Moderator, Rt. Rev. G.K. Sintim Misa as the officiating minister. Between 1970 and 1980, a number of staff bungalows, a five –unit classroom block, a two-storey dormitory block and a Home Science block with practice house were built. In 1972 some buildings at the premises of Kibi Men's Training College, which had been phased out a year earlier were given to the college. In 1976, the College became co-educational with the admission of sixteen male students. It was then renamed Kibi Presbyterian Training College. The courses pursued by students continued to be the four- year post-middle programme until 1988, when the four-year course was phased out countrywide and replaced with the three-year post secondary course. The last batch of four-year students, and the first batch of three- year post secondary students passed out in 1991. The period from the second half of the 1990s to the present has been marked by considerable face-lift and upgrading. Classrooms, dormitories, a library and staff bungalows have been rehabilitated. The course offered was upgraded to Diploma in Basic Education in October 2004. On September 1, 2007 the college was granted accreditation as a tertiary institution.The vision of the founders has been fulfilled - the products permeate all walks of life and are making significant contributions to educational and general national development. {  + List of principals: !Name !Years served - Miss Martha Baehler 1963 – 1969 - Mrs. Elizabeth Addo 1970 – 1980 - Rev.

History  The history of St. Francis College of Education Hohoe dates back to the early days of German Missionary activities when it first opened at Gbi Bla then part of the former German Territory of Togo Land. Since that time, the College has had a chequered existence. St. Francis Training College of Catholic foundation was established by German Catholic Missionaries, but was closed down three years later and removed to Agbedrafo in Togo (now Republic of Togo). It was re- opened in 1912 and closed down again as a result of the First World War (1914 – 1918). At a meeting of Heads of the Missionaries at Accra in August, 1929, the College was opened again at Gbi Bla as a rural training centre. In 1930, work on the transformation of the centre into a training college was begun. In January 1931, the college was opened with 18 students by the late Bishop Augustine Herman and renamed St. Francis Training College with Rev. Fr. J. G. Holland as the principal. In 1934, the college was again closed down, and removed to Amisano. The college then became a 2-year Certificate ‘B’ teacher training college when it was opened on 14 February 1947 due to the untiring efforts of the Bishop J. G. Holland. The first members of staff were four: two expatriates one of whom Mr. G. J. Finnegan, was the principal, Mr. Hugh O’ Kelly, Vice Principal; and two Africans, Mr. P. K. Akoto-Ampaw and Mr. V. K. Ayivor. The pioneer students numbered thirty. In 1954, thirty women were admitted into the college, making the college a co-educational institution. The two-year certificate ‘B’ course ended in 1962, and a four-year certificate ‘A’ course was introduced. A two-year History Specialist course was offered between 1964 and 1967. This course was removed to the Advanced Teacher Training College at Winneba. In 1968, the four-year course students were joined by some seventy men and a woman for a two-year certificate ‘A’ post- secondary course. In September 1973, a two-year Science and Mathematics Specialist course was introduced. St. Francis’ College was among the 38 teacher training colleges given accreditation by National Accreditation Board (Ghana) to tertiary institution in September, 2007 to offer Diploma in Basic Education programme. FRANCO was ranked first among the colleges when the maiden final results of the Diploma in Basic Education was released by the Institute of Education University of Cape Coast.

It was founded in September 1960 by the Kumasi Catholic Diocese and is affiliated to the University of Education, Winneba. It has always trained women but trained men for a brief period between 1974 and 1981.  History  In September 1960, the Catholic Diocese of Kumasi established St. Louis College of Education. The first principal was Sr. Mary Consilli. She was assisted by Sr. Mary Vibiana and three other members of staff. The pioneer students were thirty-five with Miss Grace Owusu as the College prefect. Nana Otumfuo Osei Agyeman Prempeh II donated a vast expanse of land for the establishment of the college, but unfortunately the land has been encroached upon, making it impossible for the expansion of infrastructural facilities. The teething problem that faced the college in its early days was funding. In view of that, it was ran with funds from the salaries of the Principal and her Vice, as well as support from the Catholic Diocese of Kumasi, funding agencies abroad and other local well-wishers. Since its establishment, the college has gone through the following programmes: 4-year Post Middle Certificate ‘A’, 2-year Post Secondary Certificate ‘A’, 3-year Post Secondary Certificate ‘A’, and it is now running 3-year Diploma in Basic Education. It has been accredited as a tertiary institution since September, 2007. The College has always trained women except for a short period from 1974/75 to 1980/81 academic years when it trained men as well. In the 1997/98 academic year, the College became the first women's teacher training college in Ghana to run a Science course sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation through Female education in Mathematics and Science Association which was introduced in the 2004/05 academic year. The College has total staff strength of 112, made up of 59 teaching staff and 53 non-teaching staff. The total regular students population for 2007/08 academic year stands at 906.

The academic performance of students of the college has been encouraging over the years. The college came first in the Quiz Competition organized among the ten training colleges of Ashanti- Brong/Ahafo (ASHBA Zone). Again, it took the first position in the National Spelling ‘Bee’ Competition organized by the University of Cape Coast at the zonal level, and became the first Runner-up at the national level. In sports, St. Louis Training College has an enviable record at the ASHBA zonal level, and has contributed largely to the women's contingent for the zone at the National Teacher Training College Games. Other remarkable achievements include the Ashanti Best teacher training College Golden Jubilee Independence March- past Award 2007, and also placing first in Ghana's Golden Jubilee Anniversary Singing Competition in Ashanti Region. The college has limited land for the expansion of infrastructural facilities. However, the following projects have been executed in recent times: 16 Unit-Classroom Block funded by the GETFund, ICT Centre, a modern Library and a Resource Centre all of which were executed with internally generated funds. The college has a Student Representative Council Office, and a Counseling Centre that serves not only the students, but also basic school pupils in the immediate catchment area.

The front was first formed in September 1918, fighting against the White Don Cossacks and the Volunteer Army in southeastern Russia. It advanced into the North Caucasus in January 1919, but was forced to retreat from eastern Ukraine by an attack of the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) in May and June. The Southern Front then retreated in the face of the latter's Moscow offensive, launching a counterattack in August that advanced into northeastern Ukraine and to the Don River. With its rear disrupted by White cavalry raids, the front retreated north in September and early October, moving as far as Orel. In October the front launched a counteroffensive, defeating the AFSR, leading to the latter's precipitate retreat to the Black Sea by early January. The front was redesignated the Southwestern Front on January 10, 1920, at the beginning of the Red advance into the North Caucasus. The front was formed for a second time in September 1920, with troops transferred from the Southwestern Front. It fought in the defeat of Pyotr Wrangel's Russian Army in Crimea, forcing the evacuation of the latter in November with the Perekop–Chongar operation. The front was disbanded in December, reorganized into the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Crimea.  1st formation   Formation  The Southern Front was first formed by an order of the Revolutionary Military Council on 11 September 1918, which replaced the Red Army's organization into screens with fronts, under the command of Pavel Sytin. It included all troops previously part of the Bryansk and Kursk areas of the Western Screen, the Voronezh, Povorino, and Balashov-Kamyshin areas of the Southern Screen, the Red Army of the North Caucasus, and the Astrakhan Group of Forces. It is referred to in some sources as the Southern Front against Krasnov and Denikin to distinguish it from the front's 2nd formation. The front headquarters was formed from units of the Southern Screen headquarters and its Military Council from the Military Council of the North Caucasus. It was initially based at Kozlov. When it was first formed, the front was tasked with maintaining the demarcation line between the Red Army and Austro-German troops in Ukraine, and fighting Pyotr Krasnov's Don Cossack Host and Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army in southeastern Russia. On 3 October, the front's sector was divided into five areas, which were reorganized as * 8th Army : from the Bryansk, Kursk, and Voronezh regions of screen forces, on the Yevstratovka and Kalach directions, * 9th Army : units on the Povorino and Balashov directions, * 10th Army : units on the Kamyshin and Tsaritsyn directions, * 11th Army : units of the Western region of the North Caucasus, * 12th Army : units of the Eastern region of the North Caucasus, when the Red Army formed numbered field armies.  Tsaritsyn and advance into the North Caucasus  Between September and November, it defended against Don Cossack attacks on Tsaritsyn and Kamyshin, in the area of the Povorino-Tsaritsyn railway, and towards Voronezh. Due to the 11th and 12th Armies in the North Caucasus being cut off by White advances from the rest of the front, on 2 November, the two armies were subordinated to the Caspian-Caucasian Section of the Southern Front. It launched a failed offensive in November, which resulted in the replacement of Sytin with Latvian Rifleman Pēteris Slavens on 9 November. On 8 December, the Caspian-Caucasian Section became the independent Caspian-Caucasian Front. The Group of Forces on the Kursk direction, formed on 18 November, was subordinated to the front on 19 December. The front achieved success in a January 1919 offensive against the Don Army, advancing along the Tsaritsyn- Velikoknyazheskaya railway and reaching the Don. On 24 January, Vladimir Gittis replaced Slavens. The Group of Forces on the Kursk direction was renamed the Donetsk Group of Forces on 15 February, and was expanded into the 13th Army on 5 March. On 13 March, the Don River Flotilla was operationally subordinated the front, remaining with it until its disbandment on 28 June. Between March and June, the front fought to suppress the Vyoshenskaya uprising of the Don Cossacks in stanitsas on the Upper Don. By April, it had taken Rostov-on-Don, crossed the Manych River, and advanced towards Bataysk and Tikhoretsk. On 27 April the 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army joined the front; it became the 14th Army on 4 June.  Retreat from Ukraine  Revolutionary Military Council Chairman Leon Trotsky reviewing front troops at Kharkov at the end of May or early June 1919 In May, the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) launched an offensive, which forced the front to retreat from the Don Host Oblast, the Donbass, Kharkov, Belgorod, Balashov and Tsaritsyn. On 21 May, the 11th Separate Army and Astrakhan-Caspian Flotilla were subordinated to the front; the former disbanded on 4 June with its 34th Rifle Division and 7th Cavalry Division being transferred to the 10th Army. Between 8 June and 10 January 1920, the Orel Military District was operationally subordinated to the front. On 17 June, the Special Corps was subordinated to the front. It had been formed on 10 June as the Separate Expeditionary Corps from troops assigned to suppress the Vyoshenskaya uprising, but was disbanded on 1 July. On 28 June, the Ukrainian Group of Forces was formed from the 12th Army (2nd formation, transferred from the Western Front) and 14th Army, as well as the troops of the Kharkov Military District military commissariat for combat on the left bank of the Dnieper. It was led by the 12th Army commander Nikolai Semyonov. After the army was transferred on 26 July, the group was dissolved.Southern Front positions at start of Denikin's Moscow offensive  Fighting the Moscow offensive  On 13 July, Gittis was replaced by Vladimir Yegoryev. On 23 July, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic ordered that the 9th and 10th Armies become a shock group directly subordinated to him for the main attack against the AFSR towards Rostov and Novocherkassk. However, on 27 July, the group, renamed the Special Group and commanded by Vasily Shorin, was operationally subordinated to the front. The front then retreated in the face of Denikin's Moscow offensive, relinquishing Kiev, Odessa, Kursk, Voronezh, and Orel between August and October. In August, the front headquarters moved to Orel. By orders of 5 and 13 August, a group under the command of Vladimir Selivachyov, named after its commander, was formed from troops of the 8th and 13th Armies and the Voronezh Fortified Region for the secondary attack against the AFSR towards Kharkov. Between 14 August and 12 September, the front launched a counterattack known as the August counteroffensive of the Southern Front utilizing the Special Group and the Selivachyov Group. Its forces attacked towards Kharkov, capturing Biryuch, Valuyki, Volchansk, Kupyansk, and Pavlovsk, reaching the Don and Khopyor Rivers, and defended in the area of Tsaritsyn and Kamyshin. However, the raids of Don Cossack cavalry commanders Konstantin Mamontov and Andrei Shkuro disrupted the front's rear, and through September and early October the front retreated to the north again, giving up Kursk, Livny, Kromy, and Orel. By late September Group Selivachyov had ceased to exist under the pressure of the White advance. The front headquarters relocated north to Tula during the month due to the AFSR advance. The 9th and 10th Armies, still part of the Special Group of the front, became the basis of the new Southeastern Front on 30 September. On 1 October, the Outer Southern Defense Region was created by the front, uniting the Yelets, Kozlov, and Tambov Fortified Regions to defend the southern approaches to Moscow in the Orel Governorate and parts of the Kursk, Tambov and Chernigov Governorates. During the month, the front headquarters relocated to Sergiyevsk, and then Serpukhov, ahead of the White advance. Semyon Budyonny's Cavalry Corps was transferred to the front's 10th Army on 7 October.  Defeat of the Armed Forces of South Russia  On 11 October, it commenced a counteroffensive, with the Orel–Kursk operation and Voronezh–Kastornoye operation. Alexander Yegorov took command of the front for the counteroffensive, and led it for the rest of its existence. During the Orel–Kursk operation between 11 October and 18 November, the front's forces recaptured Kromy, Orel, Fatezh, Sevsk, Lgov, Dmitriyev, and Kursk. The Voronezh–Kastornoye operation between 13 October and 16 November retook Voronezh, Liski, and Kastornoye. The front's counteroffensive forced the AFSR into a headlong retreat. The 12th Army rejoined the front on 16 October. On 25 October, with the defeat of the AFSR, the Outer Southern Defense Region was disbanded and its troops used to form the 61st Rifle Division. The Cavalry Corps was redesignated the 1st Cavalry Corps of the front on 30 October, and became the 1st Cavalry Army on 17 November. Advancing in tandem with the Southeastern Front from November, the Southern Front fought in the Kharkov operation between 24 November and 12 December, capturing Stary Oskol, Novy Oskol, Sumy, Biryuch, Volchansk, Valuyki, Kupyansk, Belgorod, Kharkov, and Pavlovsk. In the Donbass operation, it crossed the Seversky Donets, capturing Izyum, Slavyansk, Bakhmut, Debaltsevo, Gorlovka, Ilovaysk, Konstantinovka, Lugansk, and Mariupol. The front pushed the Armed Forces of South Russia back to the Black Sea and North Caucasus by early 1920, and moved its headquarters forward to Kursk in early January. Its troops inflicted heavy losses on the Armed Forces of South Russia, and fought in the Rostov–Novocherkassk Operation between 3 and 10 January, capturing Taganrog, Novocherkassk, Rostov-on-Don, and Tikhoretsk, reaching the Sea of Azov. It was redesignated as the Southwestern Front on 10 January 1920, with the 1st Cavalry and 8th Armies transferred to the Southeastern Front, and the 12th, 13th, and 14th Armies remaining with the Southwestern Front.

Under the command of Mikhail Frunze for the duration of its existence, the front is referred to in some sources as the Southern Front against Wrangel to distinguish it from the 1st formation. It was tasked with fighting Pyotr Wrangel's Russian Army, which had advanced out of Crimea into the Northern Taurida. From its formation, the front included the 6th and 13th Armies and the 2nd Cavalry Army, which were transferred from the Southwestern Front. It also included the Kremenchug, Yekaterinoslav, and Primorsky Fortified Regions, the last responsible for defending the Black Sea coast. A key role in front operations was played by Nestor Makhno's anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. British-made Mark IV tank used by White Army, captured 14 October 1920 in the Kakhovka bridgehead In September and October, the front fought against the Russian Army in northern Taurida, repulsing its attacks towards the Donbass, Nikopol and Aleksandrovsk, which aimed at creating a bridgehead on the Dnieper's right bank. The troops of the front held the Kakhovka bridgehead on the river's left bank. On 21 October, the 1st Cavalry Army was transferred to the front from the reserve of the Commander- in-Chief, and the 4th Army was formed by the front. In a counteroffensive in northern Taurida between 28 October and 3 November, the front's troops advanced out of the Kakhovka bridgehead, capturing Perekop, Henichesk, Agayman, Melitopol, Nizhniye Serogozy, Salkovo, and Chongar. A map of the Soviet plan for the Perekop–Chongar operation During the Perekop–Chongar operation between 7 and 17 November it broke through Russian Army defenses on the Isthmus of Perekop, crossing the Sivash and capturing the Lithuanian peninsula, the fortified Turkish Wall, Yushun, and Chongar positions. After breaking through at Perekop, the front advanced into Crimea, capturing Simferopol, Feodosiya, Sevastopol, Kerch, and Yalta, forcing the Russian Army to evacuate. On 12 November the 13th Army was disbanded and its troops merged with the 4th Army. The 2nd Cavalry Army was reduced to a corps on 6 December. On 10 December, in accordance with an order of 3 December, the front headquarters was reorganized into the headquarters of the Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Crimea, with the 4th, 6th, and 1st Cavalry Armies.

It has a spire of unusual shape and was designed in 1847–1856 by the vicar, Rev. John Parker (vicar 1845–60). St Michael the Archangel was designed and rebuilt from a medieval church in stages between 1847 and 1853. He designed the porches, ceilings, windows and reredos. The idiosyncratic almost detached steeple was designed and added 1855-6 by the same vicar, who also designed and built the two nearby listed buildings comprising the school house and schoolmaster's house (at one time used as the post office). The design has been referred to in the Pevsner Architectural Guides as \\"bizarre\\", but \\"unforgettable\\", particularly the tower, which was apparently modelled on that of Freiburg Minster.Pevsner and Newman, Shropshire, Buildings of England series, p.336 The interior is even more unconventional, with many texts and stencilled patterns.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The school district was established in Sverdrup Township on January 3, 1884, and its first building was a log house constructed by John Randall. It was named for William Barnhard, one of the founders of the district. with The log building was replaced the following year by a single- story frame structure, and it was replaced by a two-story frame structure in 1905. By the 1930s this building had become dilapidated and it was considered a fire trap. In July 1938 local voters passed a bond issue and the Works Progress Administration approved the application to construct a new school building. Fergus Falls architect E.O. Broaten designed the building in the Moderne style. The T-shaped structure features a raised basement of exposed reinforced concrete and split-stone walls on the main level. The main level contained two classrooms, a library, and an office, while the basement housed a community room with a stage, a kitchen, fuel room, boiler room, and storage room. The building served as a school until 1982. Five years later a non- profit arts group reopened it as an art center, but foundered after encountering financial difficulties. The former school stood vacant for years and was put up for sale in 2000. Sandra Barhouse, an art professor from St. Cloud State University, purchased the building and undertook an extensive renovation into a private residence and art gallery.

Both were funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter, and broke site records for fundraising for literature publication. The books each feature short stories about 100 real women who can be role models to children. Writing and publication The first volume of Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls was written by Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, and it was published in 2016. The first and second volumes of Goodnight Stories were crowdfunded on Kickstarter, both breaking records on the website. The first volume was Kickstarter's \\"most funded children's book\\", raising over $675,000 (with an original goal of $40,000). The second volume was their \\"fastest-funded publishing project\\" ever. Each book in the series dedicates one page to the story of 100 women (all with illustrations by woman artists) who can be role models to children. The women come from different backgrounds, eras, and are culturally diverse and have a wide variety of occupations. Examples of entries include Malala Yousafzai, Alicia Alonso, Manal al-Sharif, J. K. Rowling, Irena Sendlerowa, and Lella Lombardi. Reception Good Night Stories has sold over one million copies, and has been translated into more than 47 languages. They have received praise for being an alternative to the stereotypical portrayal of girls and women in fiction (such as the Disney Princess), or books about heroes which primarily focus on male protagonists. It focuses on telling young girls that they can grow up to be whatever they wish, regardless of what other people think. The book series inspired a similar book series aimed at a male audience: Stories for Boys Who Dare to be Different by Ben Brooks (author), and Illustrated by Quinton Winter. . Ben Brooks and Quinton Winter also collaborated on a book aimed at a gender-neutral demographic, containing a mix of male and female role models, Stories for Kids Who Dare to be Different . In September 2019, the Turkish government’s board for the protection of minors from obscene publications ruled that book could only be sold to adults and must be concealed from view in shops, stating that \\"some of the writings in the book will a detrimental influence on the minds of those under the age of 18.\\" The inclusion of Aung San Suu Kyi in the book has received criticism for her failure to condemn the ongoing Rohingya persecution in Myanmar. Favilli and Cavallo have commented that they are considering (but have not committed to) removing her from future printings of the book. Tricia Lowther criticised the book's title for gender exclusivity, feeling it implies only girls should learn about the women in the book.

Cooney robbed 10 buildings with her husband Ed Cooney before she was caught. She became known as the Bobbed Haired Bandit for her exploits. The robberies received significant media coverage, making headlines in The New York Times, the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, The Los Angeles Times, and others. The newspapers criticized Richard Enright and the New York City Police Department for their inability to catch Cooney. In response, Enright ordered the largest manhunt in the city's history, and still failed to catch Cooney. Cooney evaded capture for 65 days, eventually fleeing to Florida after a botched robbery of the payroll office of the National Biscuit Company. While in Florida, she gave birth to a child, who died several days later. She was caught in April 1924, and sentenced to twenty years in prison, of which she served seven. After leaving prison, she spent the rest of her life in relative obscurity, dying in 1992. Early life Celia Cooney was born in 1904. She ran away from her home in 1920. In 1922, she met Ed Cooney, with whom she fell in love. The couple married on May 18, 1923. Cooney worked at the Ostrander Company, and Ed Cooney as a mechanic. Robberies Her first robbery took place on January 5, 1924 when Celia Cooney entered a Thomas Ralston grocery in Park Slope, and asked for a dozen eggs. She subsequently held up the store, and stole a total of 680 dollars. The robbery received a smattering of coverage in the Brooklyn Eagle and Brooklyn Citizen. Celia and Ed Cooney soon moved to 1099 Pacific Street. pp.33–35 They spent the money quickly, and subsequently robbed an Atlantic and Pacific at 451 Ralph Avenue, and a H. C. Bohack store. In total, they netted about $365 from the two robberies. The New York Daily News and Telegram and Evening Mail covered the robberies, with the Mail coining the nickname 'bobbed hair bandit'. pp. 38–43 The robberies began to attract media attention, with newspapers ridiculing Richard Enright for his incapability to catch the bandit. On January 14, Enright announced that he had caught the bandit. He claimed that it was Helen Quigley, a twenty-three year old actress. Celia Cooney subsequently left a message at a drugstore on Dekalb Avenue. “You dirty fish-peddling bums, leave this innocent girl alone and get the right ones, which is nobody else but us ... We defy you fellows to catch us.” Another robbery occurred on Union Street on January 20. The various robberies were covered on front pages in the Daily News, Brooklyn Standard Union, Eagle, Citizen, New York Post, New York Journal-American, The New York Times and others. p.65 At least one poem was written about the robberies. Enright continued to be heavily criticized for his inability to catch Celia Cooney, as they robbed more stores. As the robberies continued, Enright stepped up his efforts to catch Cooney, naming Mary Cody and Rose Moore as suspects. pp. 75–84 F. Scott Fitzgerald would later claim that his wife Zelda Fitzgerald had been accused of being the Bobbed Haired Bandit, being stopped on Queensboro Bridge in Queens. The newspapers continued to cover the chase, with the New York Herald and others comparing Cooney to a modern-day Robin Hood. Enright soon assembled 850 detectives, and made catching Cooney their top priority, giving the detectives permission to shoot on sight. Despite having an additional 200 policemen on patrol, Cooney still evaded capture. pp.87–91 Enright eventually established a group of eight detectives known as the “bobbed-hair squad.\\" that consisted of William Casey, Frank Gray, Joseph McCarthy, Joseph Owens, Peter Mathers, and Charles Motjenacker, tasked sole with catching Cooney. p.122 On March 5, he ordered half of his reserve police force in Brooklyn to aid the detectives in stopping Celia Cooney. That same night, she robbed another drugstore, and again evaded capture. p.129 With the search intensifying, the Cooneys laid low for much of the rest of March, even as the news began covering the topic further. pp.143–147 The robberies that the couple were pulling off, while drawing much attention, were often only bringing in just barely enough to survive on. In order to secure their financial well-being, the couple planned to rob the payroll office of the National Biscuit Company warehouse. The robbery occurred on April 1, 1924. They held up the cashier, Nathan Mazo and several employees. Mazo attempted to stop the robbery, and Ed Cooney subsequently shot him, as he believed that Celia Cooney had been hurt. The couple fled, leaving $8,000 behind in the open safe. The Cooneys fled New York on a Clyde Line steamer, and travelled to Florida. In New York City, the failed robbery set off a large manhunt, where the police failed to find them. On April 3, they arrived in Jacksonville, Florida. pp.163–165 Celia Cooney's baby was born on April 10, and within two days it died. p.182 On April 15, the police disclosed the identity of Celia and Ed Cooney to the public, and several days later the couple was caught.p. 172, pp.183–185  Capture and trial  The capture of the 'Bobbed Hair Bandit' made the front page of many New York City newspapers, as well as the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, and the Los Angeles Times. As she was brought up to New York City for her trial, thousands of people turned out to see her as her train passed. pp.193–196 When she arrived in New York City, a large crowd greeted her. The New York World described the crowd: “Neither Presidents nor Jack Dempsey had attracted such a throng to Pennsylvania station as Celia Cooney, Brooklyn’s Bobbed Haired Bandit and her husband, Edward did when they reached this city at 3:30.” She was tried in Jefferson Market Courthouse, and sentenced to twenty years in prison. She spent her time in Auburn Prison. Later life Ed Cooney had his fingers smashed in a machine while in prison, and had his arm eventually amputated below the elbow. He, weakened, developed tuberculosis and would eventually die in 1936. Before his death, in 1931, Ed filed a $100,000 case against New York state because of the loss of his arm. His lawyers, Samuel S. Leibowitz, and Jacob Shientag won the case, granting a settlement of $12,000 to the family. The couple were released on October 16, 1931. Celia Cooney spent the rest of her life in relative obscurity, working as a typist, and later at Sperry Gyroscope. She married Harold La Grange in 1943, and died on July 13, 1992. pp.300–318 Cooney's exploits would soon enter popular culture, with lectures, plays, and songs featuring her story. p.292  References  Bibliography * Category:1904 births Category:1992 deaths Category:American robbers ","title":"Celia Cooney"},{"id":"56154622","text":"Thomas Edward Lloyd (12 April 1820 – 23 September 1909) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was Conservative MP for Cardiganshire from 1874 to 1880. Lloyd belonged to one of the ancient families of Cardiganshire who came into possession of Coedmore (or Coedmawr in Welsh) in the seventeenth century when another Thomas Lloyd married the heiress of the Lewis family who previously owned the estate. Lloyd was the son of Thomas Lloyd, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Cardiganshire from 1854 until 1857 and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Edward Longcroft of Llanina. At the Cardigan Boroughs by-election in 1855, Thomas Lloyd nominated the Liberal candidate, John Evans, who suffered a rare Liberal defeat in the seat to the Conservative candidate, John Lloyd Davies. Lloyd was educated at Rugby School and was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1845. He was a JP for Cardiganshire and neighbouring Carmarthenshire. Lloyd married Clemena Daniel in 1850, and they had one daughter, Edith. The 1874 general election When a general election was called at short notice in early 1874, Lloyd emerged as an unexpected Conservative candidate for Cardiganshire, and won a surprise victory which was greeted with consternation and surprise in the Liberal ranks. The sitting Liberal member, Evan Mathew Richards, had won the seat in 1868 in a contest heavily influenced by allegations of coercion, and the introduction of the secret ballot was expected to make the seat safe for the Liberals. Lloyd's choice was unexpected because he was not a prominent landowner and his estate only comprised 450 acres. However, he was a strong choice in many ways. His father, Thomas Lloyd of Coedmore was regarded as a Liberal rather than a Conservative. Lloyd had also not been involved in conflict with his tenantry, and his candidacy would not therefore attract the same degree of opposition as would face one of the more prominent landowners. There were suggestions early in the campaign that the contest would be closer than might be expected, as the Liberals had not expected a contest, or at least a contest against a plausible candidate. Lloyd's candidacy was kept a closely guarded secret until nomination day, although his leaflets and campaign literature had been printed. The Liberal leaders in the county were unaware that they would be opposed until Lloyd's address, in which he described himself as a Liberal- Conservative, was published the morning of the nomination day. In later years, there were allegations of irregularities, and that a ballot box had been tampered with when kept overnight at Aberaeron. In 1880, Lloyd was defeated by Lewis Pugh Pugh of Abermad, who was related to the Pryse family of Gogerddan. He played little part in public life thereafter and seldom attended any meetings of the magistracy following the formation of Cardiganshire County Council in 1889. Later life and death Following his electoral defeat, Lloyd played little part in the public life of Cardiganshire and ran a household in London as well as at Coedmore. In 1881, he resided at Victoria Street, Westminster. Lloyd's wife, Clemena, died in 1882. On 27 August 1885, Lloyd married Eliza Mary Bennett at St Thomas Church, Portland Square, London. In December 1895, his daughter, Edith, married Albert Coghlan who had previously been employed as a groom at Coedmore. Coghlan died in 1898. Edith died in 1908. Lloyd lived in retirement at Coedmore until his death, aged 89, on 23 September 1909. On the evening of 27 September his remains were taken from Coedmore to Cilgerran Station from where they were transported to London for cremation according to his wishes. His second wife, Eliza, lived on at Coedmore until her death in 1947.

He was the central figure of the Mornay plot of 1574. Charles de Mornay was a French nobleman and Huguenot Calvinist. He served in the French troops in Scotland from 1547-1550. Between 1557 and 1559, he served as Swedish envoy to Poland, Denmark and England, during the marriage negotiations between queen Elizabeth of England and Eric XIV of Sweden. In 1559, he was the courtier who informed Eric about his the affair between princess Cecilia of Sweden and her brother-in-law, which resulted in the famous scandal known as the 'Vadstena Thunder'.Charles de Mornay, urn:sbl:17458, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Ingvar Andersson.), hämtad 2020-08-03. He was a favorite of Eric XIV. He was an envoy to France and Scotland in 1561-62 during the negotiations of a marriage between Eric XIV and Mary Stuart, served as the king's adviser and member of the royal council. He served as a military commander in the Northern Seven Years' War. He was a prisoner in Denmark 1566-71, and was invited to return to the royal council by John III of Sweden. In the autumn of 1573, a plot was prepared to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasadöttrarna ['The Vasa Daughters']. Falun: Historiska Media. (In Swedish) John III was to be killed during a swords dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic. After the assassination, the king's brother Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. Charles de Mornay, who had previously been the favorite of Eric XIV, promised that he knew the location of Eric's alleged hidden gold reserve, which he would reveal after the coup in exchange for better conditions for Eric in prison. However, the plot did not materialize as de Mornay lost his nerve and never gave the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot. However, it is noted, that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Banér and Pontus De la Gardie, often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth of Sweden, meetings where Princess Cecilia of Sweden had also frequently been seen, and the two sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised though they were never accused. Charles de Mornay also revealed, that one of the things which were agreed upon by the conspirators was to raise the dowry of Elizabeth from 100,000 to 150,000, so to make it possible for her to make a marriage of higher status. It is noted, that the marriage between Elizabeth and Henry III of France, which was officially suggested in 1574, could have been informally suggested through Charles already the year before, and that the French ambassador had expressed himself impressed by everything regarding Elizabeth with the exception of her dowry.

It was built as a stone arch and truss bridge from 1872 to 1874, was 260 metres long and 30 metres high, and carried the Donnersberg Railway from Hungerberg over the valley of the Pfrimm to the Zeller Valley Railway, which is only open at weekends today. The bridge is a protected monument and forms the \\"Gateway to the Zellertal\\" (Tor zum Zellertal).  Location  The viaduct was built east of Marnheim. The remains of its northern stone arch bridge are located on the northeastern edge of the village at about . It is 45 metres south of the B 47 and 200 metres north of the confluence of the Goldbrunnengraben (Goldbrunnenbächlein) and the Rhine tributary, the Pfrimm, and carries a field track. About 240 metres south-southeast of the centre of the northern part of the bridge at a height of about near the south bank of the Pfrimm is are stone pier remains of the southern abutment.  History and description  The Pfrimm Viaduct was built as a 260-metre-long and 30-metre-high stone arch and truss bridge with a superstructure of lattice and steel girder design between the years 1872 and 1874. Its bridge piers were built on post foundations. On 20 March 1945, Shortly before the end of the Second World War the bridge was blown up by withdrawing Wehrmacht troops. The link to Mainz via Alzey was thus cut. After the war there were attempts to rebuild the viaduct, but they foundered – as did a new route without a viaduct – due to the cost. In addition the railway had transferred services to buses. Since the construction of the B 47 north of the viaduct, when the adjoining railway embankment (in the upper photograph the formerly covered stones are still visible during related work) was removed, the northern bridge remains have stood isolated in the open.

He was the top-rated two-year-old in Ireland when he won all three of his starts including the Futurity Stakes and National Stakes. In the following spring he was regarded as one of the few colts in Europe capable of challenging Frankel but finished unplaced behind the English champion in the 2000 Guineas and did not race again that year. In 2012 he was campaigned in California but made no impact in two starts before his track career was ended by injury. He was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in South Africa. Background Pathfork is a bay horse with a white star bred in Kentucky by Flaxman Holdings, a company owned by the Niarchos family. In September 2009, the yearling was consigned to the Keeneland Association sale and was bought for $230,000 by the Silverton Hill partnership. The colt was sent to Ireland and entered training with Jessica Harrington at Moone in County Kildare. His sire Distorted Humor was a successful racehorse, but just below top-class, scoring his biggest wins at Grade II level. As a breeding stallion he made an immediate impact by siring Funny Cide in his first crop of foals and went on to get numerous major winners including Drosselmeyer, Commentator, Flower Alley and Any Given Saturday. Pathfork's dam Visions of Clarity showed considerable ability as a racehorse, winning the Listed Prix Bagatelle over 1600 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse in 2003. She was a half-sister to Spinning World and, as a granddaughter of Aviance, closely related to many good horses including Chimes of Freedom, Aldebaran (American Champion Sprint Horse), Dietrich (King George Stakes), Saddex (Rheinland- Pokal) and Denon (Hollywood Derby). Racing career 2010: two-year-old season On his first racecourse appearance Pathfork started the 9/2 second favourite in a fourteen-runner maiden race over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 18 July. Ridden by Shane Foley he took the lead a furlong from the finish and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" to win by four lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Robin Hood. Fran Berry took over the ride when the colt was stepped up to Group 3 class for the Futurity Stakes over the same course and distance on 21 August and started the 10/11 favourite ahead of the Jim Bolger-trained Glor Na Mara (runner-up in the Phoenix Stakes). He was always among the leaders, before going to the front entering the last quarter mile and kept on well in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths from Glor Na Mara. After the race Harrington said \\"He just jumped out and got a great position, Fran said he was always cruising. He's such a laid-back horse, he's brilliant with an amazing temperament. Fran said he was only getting going at the end. We'll discuss with the owners as regards future plans for him\\". With Berry again in the saddle, Pathfork was one of nine colts to contest the Group 1 National Stakes at the Curragh on 11 September and started 2/1 second choice in the betting behind Zoffany. The best-fancied of the other runners were Glor Na Mara, Janood (winner of the Washington Singer Stakes) and Casamento. Pathfork raced in third place before moving up to join the leader Casamento entering the last quarter-mile. The two colts drew away from their rivals with Pathfork prevailing by a head after a sustained struggle in the closing stages. Jessica Harrington commented \\"Fran said he had to be really tough and that he didn't really like the ground. Pure class got him there in the end and it's just fantastic. I felt sick beforehand and my panic during the race was that he was in front for so long... He did have a very hard race there\\". Despite reports that he was likely to run on dirt in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile he did not run again in 2010. 2011: three-year- old season On his three-year-old debut Pathfork was sent to England to contest the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 April and was made the 8/1 second choice in the betting behind the odds- on favourite Frankel. In the build-up to the race Jessica Harrington said \\"Everything's fine with Pathfork. I’m happy with him, he's developed well over the winter. Everything's worked out well so far\\" but admitted that Frankel was an \\"awesome\\" opponent. In the race Pathfork never looked likely to get into contention and came home seventh, twenty-six lengths behind the winner. Pathfork had injury problems which kept him off the track for the rest of the season. At the end of the year he was transferred to the United States and entered the training stable of John W. Sadler. 2011: four-year-old season In 2011 Pathfork was ridden in both of his races by Joel Rosario. On 4 February at Santa Anita Park the colt made his first appearance for his new trainer and finished sixth of seven runners behind Mr Commons in the Grade II Arcadia Handicap. A month later he was dropped in class for an allowance race at the same track in which he started favourite but came home last of the six runners. Stud record At the end of his racing career Pathfork was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Highlands Stud Farm in South Africa. Pedigree *Pathfork was inbred 3 × 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

He was one of the more prominent leaders of the Swedish nobility in their power struggle against royal authority during the 16th-century. Life He was the son of riksråd Nils Pedersson of Åkerö and Anna Hogenskild of Hedensö. In 1569 married Anna Sture (1541-1595), daughter of Svante Stensson Sture and Martha Leijonhufvud and thus niece of queen Margaret Leijonhufvud. He was raised at court, his mother being a lady-in- waiting, and became the playmate of prince Magnus, Duke of Östergötland and courtier of king Gustav I of Sweden in 1556. He was made member of the royal council by Eric XIV of Sweden and served as a military commander in the Northern Seven Years' War. In the autumn of 1573, the Mornay plot was prepared to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasadöttrarna ['The Vasa Daughters']. Falun: Historiska Media. (In Swedish) John III was to be killed during a swords dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic, and the king's brother Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. The plot did not materialize as de Mornay lost his nerve and never gave the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot, but it was noted that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Banér and Pontus De la Gardie often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth of Sweden with Princess Cecilia of Sweden, and Charles de Mornay claimed that one of the things which were agreed upon by the conspirators was to raise the dowry of Elizabeth from 100,000 to 150,000, so to make it possible for her to make a marriage of higher status, which would refer to the suggested marriage between Elizabeth and Henry III of France, in which the French ambassador had expressed himself impressed by everything regarding Elizabeth with the exception of her dowry. The two royal sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised, though neither they, Bielke, Banér or De la Gardie was openly accused of their suspected involvement. When the king and queen visited their son Sigismund III Wasa in Reval in 1589, he and Axel Bielke was appointed to serve as regent during their absence. He was described as clever and skillful and worked to increase the power of nobility against the crown. He sided with Sigimund III against Duke Charles. His son Svante fled to Denmark after the War against Sigismund to avoid execution. Hogenskild was tried during the Linköping Bloodbath in 1600, but was imprisoned rather than executed. In 1605, however, he was found to have been involved in a correspondence judged as treasonable alongside his daughter Ebba Bielke. He was executed for treason in Stockholm.

In August 2017 the Supreme Court of India declared triple talaq, which enables Muslim men to instantly divorce their wives, to be unconstitutional. The minority opinion suggested the Parliament to consider appropriate legislation governing triple talaq in the Muslim community. In December 2017, citing the Supreme Court judgment and cases of triple talaq in India, the government introduced The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017. The bill proposed to make triple talaq in any form—spoken, in writing, or by electronic means—illegal and void. Punishment for breach of the law was proposed to include up to three years imprisonment for the husband pronouncing triple talaq. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India, on the same day, but was stalled by the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. The bill was reintroduced and passed by the Lok Sabha and by the Rajya Sabha in July 2019. Consequently, the bill received assent of the President of India. The act also entitles an aggrieved woman to demand a maintenance for her dependent children. It was subsequently notified as law in the same month. The acts stands to be retrospectively effective from 19 September 2018. History The 2017 bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 27 December 2018. However, in the Rajya Sabha the opposition demanded it to be sent to the Standing Committee. As the bill stood not passed in the parliamentary session, an ordinance which had made the bill operative, expired on 22 January 2019. The government re-promulgated an identical bill on 10 January 2019. This bill was passed in the Lok Sabha but was again stalled in the Rajya Sabha. The bill lapsed again when the Parliamentary session adjourned sine die in April 2019. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019 was to expire on 29 August 2019, six weeks after start of parliamentary session, post the 2019 Indian general elections. The government introduced a new bill in the Lok Sabha on 21 June 2019. It was passed by the Lok Sabha on 25 July 2019 and by the Rajya Sabha on 30 July 2019. The bill was assented to by the President, Ram Nath Kovind, on 31 July 2019. It was subsequently notified in the gazette on the same day. The act is retrospectively effective from 19 September 2018. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017 The government had formulated the bill claiming 100 cases of instant triple talaq, since the Supreme Court judgement in August 2017 prohibiting triple talaq in India. On 28 December 2017, the Lok Sabha had passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017. The bill proposed to make triple talaq in any form — spoken, in writing or by electronic means such as email, SMS and instant messengers illegal and void, with up to three years imprisonment for the husband who pronounces triple talaq. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), Rashtriya Janata Dal, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Biju Janata Dal, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Indian Union Muslim League opposed the bill, calling it arbitrary and faulty, while the Indian National Congress supported the bill. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 Later, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill (2018) was proposed which intended to protect Muslim women. The bill was passed in 2018 and 2019 by the Lok Sabha, but lapsed after not being passed by the Rajya Sabha. On 19 September 2018, noting that the practice of instant triple talaq had continued unabated despite the 2017 judicial mandate, the government issued The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2018. An ordinance introduced into the Indian parliament lapses if either the Parliament does not approve it within six weeks of reassembly, or if disapproving resolutions are passed by both houses. Hence, a new bill named The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Union Law Minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad.  The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019  As the triple talaq ordinance of 2018 was to expire on 22 January 2019 and also because The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 could not be passed, the government repromulgated the ordinance on 10 January 2019. On 12 January 2019, the president approved the 2019 ordinance.  The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019  The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2019 was repealed on 31st July, 2019 when the bill was passed by both houses of the legislature, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and was notified by the President of India in the official gazette, and thus became an Act of Parliament.

He played college football at Texas. Early life Born in Sydney, Dickson first played soccer in his youth before switching to Australian rules football at the age of 9. In his first year of playing Australian rules football, he earned the Golden Boot award for having the best kicking. He excelled in Australian football while playing for the University of New South Wales in the local Sydney AFL competition and was subsequently placed in the Sydney Swans talent academy as a teenager. He continued to play for UNSW and the Swans reserves in the North East Australian Football League in an attempt to be drafted to a professional AFL team but was overlooked at the 2014 AFL draft. Dickson's Australian football career highlight occurred when he was chosen to play for the Swans in the 2014 NEAFL Grand Final. The Swans were defeated by a minor two-point margin in the final. In 2015, at the age of 19, he moved to Melbourne to trial with Prokick Australia, a coaching program designed to help aspiring kickers and punters cross the Pacific and crack American football. Through his Prokick Australia experience, he was picked up by the University of Texas as a punter by head coach Charlie Strong. College career Michael Dickson Big 12 Media Days In his first season with the Longhorns, Dickson had 77 punts for 3,179 net yards for a 41.3 average in 2015. In the 2016 season, he had 65 punts for 3,079 net yards for a 47.4 average. In 2017, Dickson won the Ray Guy Award and was a unanimous All- American. Dickson was named MVP of the 2017 Texas Bowl. In his junior season, he had 84 punts for 3,984 net yards for a 47.4 average. In late December 2017, it was announced that Dickson would forgo his senior year at Texas in favor of the 2018 NFL Draft.

Dickson won the punting job after the Seahawks released longtime veteran Jon Ryan. He made his NFL debut in the Seahawks' season opener against the Denver Broncos. In the 27–24 loss, he had six punts for 354 net yards. Dickson was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in Week 8 against the Detroit Lions. With minutes remaining at fourth-and-8 from their own three-yard line, Dickson was instructed to waste time in the end zone before giving up an intentional safety. Instead, he received the snap and ran it nine yards for the first down to seal the win. The play was later dubbed \\"The Aussie Sweep.\\" Dickson was named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Month for November 2018. In addition to punting, Dickson has used the previously obscure drop kick maneuver on kickoffs, both onside and the standard deep kick for the Seahawks. In the 2018 season, including the playoffs Dickson punted 80 times for 3,759 yards, averaging 48.2 yards per punt, the second highest in the league. Dickson was voted into the 2019 Pro Bowl, the first rookie punter since Dale Hatcher in 1985. In addition, Dickson was named as a first-team All-Pro. In Week 2 of the 2020 season against the New England Patriots on Sunday Night Football, Dickson punted four times (50 yard average) with all four of them landing inside the 20 yard line during the 35–30 win. He was named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in Week 2.

She was known for her riddles and the \\"Jack, Will and Tom Tales\\", in addition to the songs she recorded for Cecil Sharp. All were believed to have originated in England, Scotland or Germany, and passed down through Jane's family to her. Background She was the oldest of five children born to Emily Harmon and Ransom Hicks. Her brothers and sisters were John Riley, Mary, Margaret Elizabeth and William. The paternal Hicks lineage were emigrants from England who arrived in America prior to the American Revolutionary War.. The Harmons in the maternal lineage came to America from Wurttemberg, Germany, also before the American Revolutionary War. When Emily was about 12 or 13 years old, they joined other families in moving to Madison County, on the Meadow Fork of Spring Creek, where they began to invest in farm acreage. As Emily worked inside their home, surrounded by the children, she sang songs and told stories and riddles that been passed along through the Harmon family. Jane had only a rudimentary education, but learned the basics of reading in order to facilitate her reading of the Bible. Jane married Jasper Newton \\"Newt\\" Gentry in 1879, and the couple had nine children (Lydia Nora, Martha Emily, Mary Magdalene, Alfred Chanay, Allie Mae, Lillie Bertha Maud, Roy Stevens, Lalla Marvin, Nola Jane). Their youngest child was born after they moved to Hot Springs. There they bought acreage on which they raised livestock and farm produce. The Gentry children were enrolled in the Presbyterian-run Dorland Institute, their tuition paid through income from a grocery store run by Newt, where he sold produce grown on their land. Jane earned money by working at the school. Over the years, she supervised students who also worked at the school. Jane became part of the school's culture by continuing to tell her stories, sing a little and dance for the students and faculty. Eventually Jane ran a boarding house that welcomed students and faculty of the school. A friend of the family remembered, \\"She wove, spun, tatted, knit, crocheted, and she was always teaching other people to do these things. And she would sing and tell stories while we worked. It seemed natural for her to sing and tell stories.\\" The United States government turned Mountain Park Hotel at Hot Springs into a World War I prisoner-of-war internment camp for German sailors.; Families of the prisoners lived in town, some at Jane's boarding house. Songs and stories English musician Cecil Sharp and his assistant Maud Karpeles were invited to Appalachia by American folklorist Olive Dame Campbell in 1916 to collect English folk songs. It was Dorland principal Lucy Shafer who suggested they meet Jane Gentry. From August 24, 1916 until July 27, 1917, Sharp made several visits to record Jane's songs. In total, Gentry gave Sharp 70 songs. Sharp believed the songs to be of English origin, but Holgar Nygard, Professor Emeritus of English at Duke University, believed Scotland was a more likely origin for many of the tunes. Jane referred to her stories as \\"Jack, Will and Tom Tales\\". Musician and historian Betty N. Smith compared the structure of the tales to German Märchen fairy tales, but speculated that they may have originated with the Hick's English ancestors. Author Irving Bacheller and his wife Anna first met Jane at her boarding house in 1914, telling stories and riddles to delighted children. The Bachellers were so impressed with Jane that they invited her to visit them in Greenwich, Connecticut. According to Betty N. Smith's research, the visit was incorporated into Bacheller's novel Tower of a Hundred Bells, destroyed by a house fire in 1917, a fact confirmed after Jane's death, in a letter from Bacheller to her daughter Maud Long, \\"I wrote a book largely about your mother and her mountain life which was destroyed by a fire that burned my home in 1917.\\" Fifteen stories of Jane's were contained within twenty-three stories total published by Isabel Gordon Carter in The Journal of American Folklore in 1925. The other stories in the published work were six by Susie Wilkenson of Sevier County, Tennessee, and two stories by John Campbell of Townsend, Tennessee. As noted by Carter, folklorists of the time had primarily collected songs and overlooked the stories. When Jane was asked to tell the tales for this work, she confirmed in part that the stories had been passed down in the family, from her great-grandmother passing them down to Jane's grandfather Council Harmon. Jane's daughter Maud Long later recorded some of the stories for the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress.; Death Newt Gentry died March 24, 1922. Jane died in May 1925. Her obituary noted her knowledge of old English and Scottish folksongs.

In 1794, he came to be in service of the Swedish army and instructor of War science of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. He also became a favorite of the regent Duke Charles, devoted himself to court service and participated in the contacts between the duke and the Swiss adventurer and Russian spy Christin in 1796. He served in the Finnish War, was made Adjutant general of Charles XIII and sent to emperor Napoleon I of France to inform him of the Coup of 1809 and negotiate peace for Sweden. He continued to serve in the Swedish army under Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, took lave during the war against France in 1814 but did participate in the war against Norway. His relationship to Bernadotte was not good, and when he was given a position in Pomerania in 1815, he regarded himself exiled and resigned from Swedish service.

(formerly known as Against Gravity) and can be played on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Oculus Quest, and iOS. It was released for Microsoft Windows in June 2016, PlayStation 4 in November 2017, Oculus Quest in May 2019, and iOS in November 2019. In September 2020, the developers announced that Rec Room will be released on Xbox One, with no release date announced yet. Gameplay The game may be played with or without a virtual reality headset, specifically a SteamVR headset, OculusVR headset, or PlayStation VR headset. In virtual reality mode, the game uses full 3D motion via the motion capture system of a virtual reality headset and two hand-held motion controllers, which are required to pick up and handle objects in the game world, including balls, weapons, construction tools, and other objects. The hub room (also known as “Rec Center”) vaguely resembles the lobby of a YMCA or other recreational center (thus earning the game's title of Rec Room) with doors that lead to various games and user-generated rooms. Players can explore the space around them within the confines of their physical floor-space, while roaming further by using controller buttons to teleport a short distance, with minimal or no virtual reality sickness. A “walking” mode enables players to move continuously rather than teleporting; however, this poses a higher risk of motion sickness. Game modes Rec Room consists of separate built-in multiplayer games, including first-person shooters, cooperative action role-playing games, a charades-like game, and six sports games. Rec Room also provides in-game tools for user-generated content, which led to the creation of millions of user-generated experiences. User- generated content An in-game item called the “maker pen” is used to generate various 3D shapes that can exist in the game world and can be interacted with. These custom shapes can be placed into a number of predesigned rooms. Using the maker pen, players also have access to a number of pre-generated and user- generated game assets, such as furniture, weapons, and sports equipment, which players can place into their rooms. Players can choose to save their rooms and then list them publicly such that other players can find and visit them. Players can also publish smaller creations (called “inventions”) such that other players can find them and place them in their own rooms. Creators of popular rooms and inventions earn weekly dividends of tokens, Rec Room’s main currency. The maker pen also provides access to a node-based visual programming language, which is based on the dataflow programming paradigm and allows players to add various kinds of animated and interactive elements to their rooms. This feature allows players to create new multiplayer online video games that may be played within Rec Room; thus, the game effectively includes a game creation system. Development Seattle-based development studio Rec Room Inc (formerly Against Gravity Corp) was co-founded in April 2016 by Nick Fajt and Dan Kroymann. Prior to that, CEO Nick Fajt worked as a program manager on the HoloLens team at Microsoft. Dan Kroymann worked on the same team after working on the Xbox team. Rec Room Inc.′s CCO Cameron Brown also worked at Microsoft as HoloLens Creative Director. In 2016 and early 2017, the company raised $5 million in funding for the development of Rec Room and its player community. According to CEO Nick Fajt, the company will keep Rec Room free to download. In 2017, Rec Room \\"Junior Mode\\" was COPPA-certified by Samet Privacy. In June 2019, Rec Room Inc. announced that the company raised an additional $24 million over two rounds of funding. Playerbase While there is no definite data on how many players Rec Room has dating later than early 2019, we do know that in January 2019, there were about 30,000 - 50,000 active monthly users on Steam alone, and Rec Room had also just breached one million downloads across all platforms at this time. In September 2020 there was also an announcement video released by the Rec Room team claiming that the player base had tripled since the same time last year, as well as that 60 million people had added people as friends in the game. Also, if you look at the \\"most popular\\" section of the Oculus Quest games store on their website, it is currently listed as the 3rd most played game there, even beating out VRchat, a game that the Rec Room community is known to have a rivalry with. Reception Dan Ackerman, writing for CNET, described Rec Room as VR's killer app. In January 2017, Ars Technica reported that trolling and harassment in Rec Room were a problem. In June 2017 MIT Technology Review contributor Rachel Metz described it as a fun and significant example of VR's potential for social interaction, while criticizing its underdeveloped anti- abuse features. Filmmaker Joyce Wong described it as her choice of “most interesting piece of art in 2017”. In March 2018, Amy Sterling, writing for Forbes, mentioned room-building in Rec Room in the context of the development of a real-world match to the fictional “OASIS” of the novel Ready Player One.

Trained by Joseph Manzi, she was the first filly to win both the Kentucky Oaks and Hollywood Oaks. Her lifetime earnings were $1,375,465, and she had 13 wins from 34 races. Fran's Valentine was bred at Green Thumb Farm Stables, in Chino, California by Earl Scheib, an entrepreneur who made his fortune in discounted car paint. Both of Fran's Valentine's parents, her dam Iza Valentine, and her sire, Saros, were owned by Scheib. Scheib named Fran's Valentine after his wife Fran; the filly was his favourite horse. Racing career In November 1984, as a two-year-old, Fran's Valentine was first over the line in her first race, the inaugural Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Hollywood Park. Although she finished first by half a length, Fran's Valentine was relegated to tenth after stewards judged that she had bumped another horse at the top of the back stretch. The decision moved her jockey, Pat Valenzuela, to tears. Scheib, who was well known for starring in television commercials promoting his discount car-painting business, was asked why he was still smiling in the commercial that aired just after the race; his questioner had not realized that the commercial had been recorded in advance. Fernando Toro, the jockey of Pirate's Glow who was bumped during the race, said he could have been killed, and criticized Valenzuela's riding. The win was awarded to Outstandingly, the filly that was second across the line. On March 2, 1985, Fran's Valentine won the Las Virgenes Stakes at Santa Anita to win $77,150. Later that month, ridden by Pat Valenzuela, she won the Grade I Santa Susana Stakes by two and a half lengths, earning $122,100. Her next race, in May 1985, was the Kentucky Oaks. Fran's Valentine was the first filly that her trainer, Joe Manzi, had entered into the Oaks, and she won in a record time for the track, again ridden by Valenzuela. The track was hard, her preferred type of surface. In July 1985, Fran's Valentine won the Hollywood Oaks by a head over Magnificent Lindy; this was her fifth stakes victory in six starts. Chris McCarron rode her to this victory in a record time for the track of 1:47.25. Her winnings were $93,300, with an additional Breeders Cup award of $27,000. In August 1986, she won the Grade II Chula Vista Handicap on a track that was hard, and in 1987 she won the Santa Maria Handicap (Grade II). Retirement and stud After racing, Fran's Valentine became a broodmare; six of her ten foals became winners, including With Anticipation, a Grade I winning horse who earned over $2.6 million in his career. After having her third foal, she was bought by George W. Strawbridge Jr. Fran's Valentine was retired to Derry Meeting Farm, Cochranville, Pennsylvania, where she lived until she was euthanized at the age of 25 due to infirmities of old age.

He married three times, the first two wives dying in suspicious circumstances. Dougal spent little time before replacing them in other relationships where he sired numerous illegitimate children in addition to his legitimate progeny. Dougal's downfall came soon after a servant of his sought an affiliation order for the child she had borne him. The scrutiny from the court process revealed that the woman he had been living with as man and wife was not in fact married to him. Indeed, she had not been seen by her own relatives for four years despite her funds and share holdings having been cashed in over the same period. The discovery of this woman's murdered corpse in the grounds of their home precipitated the murder trial that ended in Dougal's conviction as a murderer and his hanging for his crime soon after.  Early life  Samuel Herbert Dougal was the oldest son of Samuel Dredge Dougal (1826–1900) and Maria Josephine Thompson (1822–1897) born in Bow, London on 15 May 1847. At age 19 he enlisted for 12 years in the Royal Engineers and was initially assigned to survey work with the Ordnance Survey. Whilst posted on this work he married (Lovenia) Martha Griffiths at Mold, Flintshire in 1869. The first of Samuel's legitimate children, Charles Herbert Dougal was born in London, when he was elsewhere in 1871. Many other children were born but not all survived long. By choice, Samuel Dougal transferred to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1877 and subsequently extended his period of service to 21 years. In June 1885 his wife, Martha, died suddenly having had no prior illness or health condition. Two months later, Samuel Dougal married a young Irish woman, Mary Herberta Boyd, who already had a child of her own. Two months from this event, Mary too was dead, dying inexplicably suddenly in October 1885. Mary was rapidly buried at Fort Massey, the place where her predecessor was also rapidly buried. Samuel nevertheless persuaded another woman, Bessie Stedman, to be his 'mate' and she initially returned with Dougal to England when he was posted to Aldershot. Nevertheless, she removed herself back to Canada after suffering abuse from Dougal. In March 1887, Dougal was discharged from the Royal Engineers.  Civilian life  On discharge from the Royal Engineers, Samuel Dougal gave what appeared to be his youngest brother's address in Battersea as his destination. He soon moved from here to the Isle of Wight where he set up home with a woman named Marian Paine, a widow with children. She subsequently bore several illegitimate children of Dougal's. With Marian, Dougal acquired the goodwill and furniture of the Royston Crow public house on Baldock Street in Ware, Hertfordshire in 1889. A fire at the Royston Crow, following soon after an earlier one that had been extinguished by a business neighbour, raised suspicions of arson. Dougal was charged with defrauding an insurance company but was found not guilty. Nevertheless, the local magistrates refused to return his licence. In 1892 Marian left Dougal owing to his bad behaviour towards her. Later in the same year he married Sarah Henrietta White a 20 year old Irish woman. With Sarah, Dougal began his career of defrauding easily victimised women. He persuaded a woman called Emily Booty to live with him as his wife but promptly spent her money and humiliated by bringing his real wife to live at their joint home. Miss Booty suffered further public humiliations attempting to regain possession of her property. Dougal moved on but did not give up his schemes until he was found guilty of stealing and forging cheques. He was sentenced to twelve months prison with hard labour to be served at Pentonville Prison. Faking a suicide attempt, he was removed to Cane Hill Lunatic Asylum where he served most of his sentence. He was discharged perfectly sane on 8 December 1896. Again his youngest brother helped him by providing employment for him at Biggin Hill, Kent and he was here until 1898 by which time he had lined up his next target, 56-year-old Camille Cecile Holland.Camille Cecile Holland, circa 1870 Miss Holland is believed to have advertised for a husband to which Dougal presented himself as a candidate. Having ensnared her, though he was still legally married to Sarah, they first set up home as a married couple near Brighton. Soon they were in negotiations to purchase Coldhams, a property in Clavering, Essex. Miss Holland was to finance the deal and insisted her name appear on the contract documentation. As Mr and Mrs Dougal, Miss Holland and Samuel Dougal found lodgings at Saffron Walden whilst Coldhams was renovated. On 24 April 1899 Miss Holland and Samuel Dougal moved into the property that they had renamed Moat House Farm - or Moat Farm as it was to become known.  Discovery  In early 1903, questions began to arise as to the whereabouts of Camille Cecile Holland and the fact that cheques and other financial instruments were being presented with what purported to be her signature. No one had seen her since 19 May 1899 when the woman servant, who had rebuffed Samuel Dougal's sexually motivated attack on her, refused to be left alone with him present. Miss Holland had left in a pony and trap with Dougal driving saying to the servant that she would not be long. Dougal returned alone and claimed that Miss Holland, whom the servant was led to believe was 'Mrs Dougal', had gone away to London. The servant's mother recovered and removed her daughter from Moat Farm the following day. Subsequently, a series of young women were to suffer similar fates at the hands of Dougal who, no sooner had they begun in their role as servant than they were preyed upon by Dougal. Within three months of his appointing Georgina \\"Kate\\" Cranwell as a servant, he had made her pregnant. She left six months after this and her baby was born in December 1902. Dougal evidently refused to provide for this child so Kate sought an affiliation order on 27 January 1903. Information given to the court revealed that Camille Cecile Holland was not married to Dougal resulting in some further enquiries being made about him. Initially, the enquiries centred on fraud and forgery until it became quite evident that Miss Holland was missing and had not been heard from by her relatives for over four years. Weeks of digging ensued at the Moat Farm until 27 April 1903 when Miss Holland's body was found. Following an inquest where it was discovered that Miss Holland had suffered a bullet wound to the head, Dougal was committed for trial on 22 June 1903.

It is badly damaged, with only fragments surviving. These consist of six folios, containing verses 1-16 and 33-116 of Psalm 118 (Beati Inmaculati...), a psalm that would have had 176 versus in total, and was a favourite of the early Irish church. It is possible that the Psalter only ever consisted of this full psalm, perhaps also with notes and commentary,O'Neil, 34 although it may have been much larger, containing the entire Psalter.Blom, 76 It kept in the library of University College Dublin (MS.A.i) The main text recounts the Gallican Psalter, and is set in a single narrow column in the middle of each folio, and written in large half-unical minuscule case. The margins are thus wide, and contain extensive glosses in both Irish and Latin; it is, along with the Southampton Psalter, one of only two surviving manuscripts to contain annotation in both of these languages.Blom, 55 Saint Caimín died in 654, but the book is generally believed to have been produced much later. Based on the style of Irish and the decorations found in the glosses, an approximation of the late 11th century is generally accepted, although it was believed to be a genuine relic of Saint Caimín for a short period.Esposito, 80 Little is known of its origins or early provenance. It is first mentioned in 1639 by Archbishop James Ussher, when it was described as \\"among the books of the Convent of Franciscans at Donnegall\\".Esposito, 78 It was taken to St Isidore's in Rome during the French Revolution, returning to Ireland in 1872.

Floridan Hotel, from a postcard, 1950s? The Floridan Hotel was a former hotel located at 204 North Monroe St. in Tallahassee, Florida, on the NW corner of Monroe and Call Streets, with a large entrance on Monroe Street. After its opening in 1927 it was for many years the largest, newest, and leading hotel in Tallahassee, and was the usual abode of state legislators and visitors with state business. It has been said that more of Florida's business took place in the Floridan than in the Florida Capitol. The Tallahassee Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce, and other civic organizations met in the Floridan during part of this time. Typical of large hotels, it contained separate small businesses: the intown ticket office for Eastern Airlines (which moved to the Tallahassee Hilton, now (2017) the Hilton Doubletree, after it opened in 1972), a barber, a women’s bookstore. A block away from the transportation center of the time at Monroe Street and Park Avenue, and four blocks from the Capitol, it prospered until automobile travel meant that its lack of parking became problematic. It was renovated in 1954, but at the end it became shabby, and no longer stylish or biggest. It was demolished in 1985.

They were used to defend the prazos and police their inhabitants. The chikunda of that period are often described as slaves, and originally some were chattel slaves, although the status of those that were soldiers, traders or administrators of parts of the prazo was that of a client or unfree dependent. The prazo system based on agriculture broke down as a result of drought and disease in the early 19th century and was replaced by a small number of virtually independent states in the Zambezi valley that were based on the trade in slaves and ivory. The name ‘’’Achikunda’’’ was then applied to groups of professional soldiers in these minor states, who were rewarded with a share of the profits of those trades. Although these minor states were mainly in Mozambique, a small number extended their influence into what are now parts of Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. The minor states in and around the Zambezi River valley were brought under closer Portuguese control as a result of the Scramble for Africa, which required colonial powers to bring territories they claimed under their jurisdiction, the doctrine of \\"effective occupation\\". Between 1891 and 1902, the Mozambique Company took control of this area and the former roles of the chikunda in securing slaves and ivory and providing internal and external security for those states became redundant, although many ex-chikunda were involved in the Barue uprising of 1917 to 1918 against the Portuguese government. A few communities along the Zambezi and Luangwa river valleys preserve their chikunda heritage, although most former chikunda have merged into their host communities. Chikunda origins The prazos Since the 16th century, the Portuguese Crown, which claimed ownership of the land in Mozambique, had leased crown lands in the Zambezi valley to Portuguese subjects under grants termed “prazos da coroa” (crown leases), nominally for three lives, with the aim of promoting development and enabling possible European settlement. In theory, a prazo grant could be cancelled if the lessee (or prazero) did not occupy and develop the land, or later deserted it, although in practice the prazo grants were renewed and became hereditary.Newitt (1973), Portuguese Settlement on the Zambesi, p. 111. The prazo holder was responsible for administering justice in the land comprised in his grant and also collecting taxes from its inhabitants, out of which he was supposed to pay an annual rent to the crown, and to maintain sufficient armed retainers to keep the peace.Newitt (1973), Portuguese Settlement on the Zambesi, p. 121. The prazeros only rarely removed the local chiefs resident on their estates, preferring to retain them as subordinates, and few attempted to start commercial agriculture, but expropriated the surplus products of their peasants and also profited from the trade in ivory and slaves.Isaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda, p. 260. The prazos varied greatly in size and number, but in 1763 there were 22 in the captaincy of Sena and 54 in the captaincy of Tete, of which three extended over hundreds of square miles but others included only a few villages.Newitt (1973), Portuguese Settlement on the Zambesi, pp. 87-90. The Afro-Portuguese prazo holders, known locally from at least the early 17th century as “muzungos”, signifying a white man, boss or patron,Dicionário Online de Português were of diverse origin and, although most claimed at least some connection with metropolitan Portugal, many had original links with Portuguese India and all, after many generations of intermarriage with African women, were African in appearance and culture.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 127-9. By the mid-18th century, as the largely African prazo owners followed local customs of matrilineal inheritance, a number of women, known as the Zambezi donas, became owners of prazos and were succeeded by their daughters rather than their sons.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique pp. 228-30.Rodrigues (2006), As donas de prazos do Zambeze, pp 18-19, 25. The early chikunda In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the term “chikunda” was not in general use for the armed retainers of a prazero, who could include chattel slaves.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, p. 143. However, although many chattel slaves were acquired by capture or purchase to undertake agricultural work, mining or as house-servants or craftsmen on the prazos, it was normal from the mid-18th century for the retainers who became soldiers or administrators to offer themselves as voluntary unfree dependents in return for protection and a prospect of advancement and enrichment. By the mid-18th century, the term chikunda, which probably derives from the Shona verb meaning “to conquer”,Isaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda p. 268. was reserved for the armed clients of the prazo owners, and other designations were used for personal or household slaves.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique pp. 233-4. The chikunda of each prazo came from diverse backgrounds, because prazeros preferred recruits without local ties, but they developed a loyalty to the group to which they belonged. They were often recruited from areas of conflict or famine, offering themselves voluntarily or, in some cases, coming as captives.Isaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda pp. 261, 263. In a survey of 1766, the two largest prazos were said to have around 700 and 500 chikunda. In early times, the chikunda were usually armed with bows and spears but, by the mid-18th century, some were armed with muskets.Isaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda pp. 266-7. The chikunda usually lived in small fortified villages, often near the margins of the larger prazos. Each chikunda village was headed by the owner's deputy called a capitão, or headman. These villages generally produced food to support the chikunda and also made a contribution in cash or goods to their master. If the prazo owner was strong, the chikunda acted as a defence and police force, keeping order and collecting tribute, but under a weak owner or in times of famine, they could become little more than bandits, preying on local communities and disregarding their nominal patron.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique pp. 235-6, 240. Individuals were incorporated into the ranks of the chikunda through a ritual under which they swore lifelong loyalty to the prazero. However prosperous or anarchic they might become, the chikunda could only rarely become completely free of their patron, who guaranteed their status as warriors and their security.Isaacman, Mulwafu and Mulwafu (1999), From Slaves to Freedmen, p. 2.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, p. 237. Some chikunda did manage to break away from their masters, leave their prazo and hunt for ivory in the Shire valley, where they competed with Yao traders in the mid-18th century McCracken (2012), A History of Malawi, p. 18. Decline of the prazos The great Mozambique drought of 1794 to 1802 and subsequent droughts and smallpox epidemics lasting into the 1830s destroyed the agricultural economy of the Zambezia prazos, as the cultivators could not feed themselves, let alone produce surpluses to maintain the chikunda and prazeros. Many chikunda deserted their prazos and some formed armed bands seeking any means to survive, so worsening the situation created by drought.Lovejoy (2011), Transformations in Slavery, p. 138.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 253-4. Other former chikunda returned, or attempted to return, to their homelands and resume their old lives, or merged into the local peoples as peasants. A few used their military skills to become elephant hunters and, in the time of Ndebele incursions, they used their guns against the invaders.Isaacman (2003), Chikunda: Transfrontiersmen and Transnational Migrations, pp. 117-8, 121. Some bands of chikunda became elephant hunters, and travelled as far north as the area around Nkhotakota and the Luangwa valley in search of new herds to exploit. They married women from the local Chewa and Tumbuka peoples and their offspring soon lost their identity as chikunda.Isaacman, Mulwafu and Mulwafu (1999), From Slaves to Freedmen, p. 16. The 19th century chikunda The Afro-Goan statelets By the 1840s, many of the former prazo owners that had survived the droughts and epidemics had left Zambezia and were replaced by five powerful families along the middle Zambezi, the da Cruz, Caetano Pereira, Vas dos Anjos, Ferrão and Alves da Silva, who were joined in the 1860s by a sixth family, the de Sousa. There were also several less prominent Afro-Portuguese families in this area and on the fringes of Portuguese influence. Most of these families were of Indian, or specifically Goanese, origin although the original Alves da Silva were from Portugal, and all of the families based their economy on the slave trade, despite its legal abolition in 1830, or hunting for ivory, rather than agriculture. Through intermarriage with the families of leading African chiefs, they were recognised as the legitimate holders of several chieftaincies by their African subjects and they adopted African titles and the indigenous symbols of kingship and patronised local religious cults, yet also received Portuguese offices or military ranks that gave them an official status.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, pp. 29-30.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 306-7. The areas controlled by the main families far exceeded those of earlier prazos, and they maintained large numbers of armed chikunda, said to number several thousand, although estimates vary. Their military strength was based on a combination of strong defensive fortifications and European firearms, including breech-loading rifles later in the 19th century. Their centres were fortified towns, called “aringas”, which were a development of the traditional stockaded village. Each aringa consisted of a wooden stockade, supported by earthworks in the form of a ditch and bank, often with inner walls protecting the more important sections of the town. One large aringa, Massangano, had fortifications 1,300 metres long and 150 to 180 metres wide.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 253-4. These mainly Afro-Goan families formed what were in effect small independent states, giving at best token allegiance to the Portuguese crown.Lovejoy (2011), Transformations in Slavery, p. 163.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 266, 276. From the 1840s, their leaders attempted to extend their influence, either by forcing neighbouring African chiefs to acknowledge their sovereignty or driving out those that resisted.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, p. 306. Several of the less prominent families included the Rosário Andrade, whose head was known as Kanyembe and who operated along the Upper Zambezi west of Zumbo, now the westernmost town in Mozambique, and the Arujo Lobo, whose head was called Matakenya and who operated in the Luangwa and Lower Shire valleys.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, p. 286. The chikunda of these two families had a reputation for exceptional savagery, never trading with local peoples but taking slaves and ivory by force, disrupting local agriculture and causing famine.Isaacman, Mulwafu and Mulwafu (1999), From Slaves to Freedmen, p. 1. One economic reason behind their expansion was the increasing demand for ivory, which had already led to the depletion of elephant herds in many areas nearer the coast and to the search for new ivory sources inland: in areas that could supply little ivory, slaves were taken insteadIsaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda, pp. 275-6. The chikunda revived In this period, the term chikunda (or achikunda with the collective prefix) was applied exclusively to the professional soldiers of the Afro-Goan or Afro- Portuguese families. These families maintained large numbers of chikunda, each having several thousand armed men at their disposal.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, p. 29. The chikunda had ceased to be clients of the prazeros when the Zambezia agricultural system had collapsed, and they were now recruited through gifts of modern weapons, land or wives, and retained by being allowed to share of the profits of slave raiding.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, pp. 22, 27-8. Some physically fit slaves were also selected, mostly from those areas north of the Zambezi that were the focus of raiding for slaves.Isaacman, Mulwafu and Mulwafu (1999), From Slaves to Freedmen, pp. 5-6. Each of the Zambezia states had a significant force of chikunda divided into regiments, usually based near the borders of its territory to facilitate slave raiding and as protection against external threats.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, pp. 28-9.McCracken (2012), A History of Malawi, p. 29. The 19th century chikunda set themselves apart from the populations among which they were quartered by living in separate villages and using a mixed language among themselves, containing elements from the chikundas’ Shona and Mang'anja home languages, and also Sena and Tonga terms from the local people, with some Portuguese phrases.Isaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda, pp. 264, 269-70. They disdained agriculture but took part in tax collection, trading, slave raiding and ivory hunting, as well as military duties and, although many came from matrilineal societies, the chikunda observed patrilineal descent and venerated the spirits of former chikunda, rather than their own ancestral spirits. To further distinguish themselves from local peasant farmers, chikunda had their own patterns of facial tattoos, filed their teeth and wore imported Calico cloth, whereas most local people wore Barkcloth.Isaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda, pp. 268-9. The Zambezi wars Portuguese attempts to co-opt the rulers of these minor Afro-Goan and Afro-Portuguese states into the colonial system by granting them full legal title to the land they occupied, tax exemptions and even sums of cash generally failed. Although these statelets extended the area of nominal Portuguese influence westward and fought off invading Ngoni incursions, their forces were used not only against indigenous African rulers but, from 1849, in fighting among themselves and even against any government forces sent against them.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, pp. 31-2.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 310-11. Until 1868, the governors of Mozambique and Tete had few troops of their own and preferred to use the chikunda of any prazeros loyal to the Portuguese government or from any minor state opposed to whatever ruler they targeted, rather than using soldiers from metropolitan Portugal or Goa. These nominally loyal chikunda had been used with some success in the 1850s against slave trading by the Sultan of Angoche and the Pereira family, but two families continued to give the Portuguese governors trouble: the Vas dos Anjos in the Lower Shire and the da Cruz, who ruled a section of the middle Zambezi in Manica and Tete provinces, centred on the aringa of Massangano. The Vas dos Anjos were forced out of their aringa at Shamo, near the junction of the Shire and Zambezi in 1858, but were allowed to regroup further north up the Shire, near its confluence with the Ruo River; the da Cruz posed much more of a problem.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 311-13. After successes against Angoche and the Pereira and Vas dos Anjos families, the governor of Tete, Miguel Gouveia, assembled a force of chikunda from the prazos around Tete in July 1867 to attack Massangano, which was only a few days march away. However, Gouveia's force was ambushed by da Cruz chikunda while on route to Massangano: most of the government chikunda were massacred and Gouveia himself was executed by the da Cruz forces. Between November 1867 and May 1869, three more expeditions were sent against Massangano, with increasing numbers of troops from Portugal and Goa, artillery and assistance from the chikunda of the de Sousa state of Gorongosa. Each failed because of poor organisation, the effects of malaria on European soldiers and the desertion of local forces.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, p. 33.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 314-15. The expedition of November 1867, mounted in the rainy season, managed to blockade the Massangano aringa, but it ran out of supplies and ammunition, managing, however, to withdraw in good order. The next expedition of May 1868 managed to besiege Massangano and caused significant casualties among its defenders. However, the da Cruz chikunda counterattacked and routed the government forces, causing them heavy casualties. The last and largest expedition of May 1869 was partly defeated by its own size as there was insufficient river transport for the troops or their supplies. Da Cruz chikunda harassed those Portuguese forces that had to march overland to Massangano and their supply lines to such an extent that they could not invest the aringa. Once the Portuguese began to retreat, the chikunda made night attacks that caused the Portuguese forces to scatter with heavy losses. Although the da Cruz were subsequently left in peace for about 20 years, and recognised as effectively autonomous, they made little use of their military successes and never became more than a bandit state, based on the slave trade and the tolls it could impose on river traffic, as they occupied a sparsely-populated and infertile area.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, p. 33.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 315-6. The formal abolition of the institution of slavery in Mozambique 1875 and of the prazo system in 1878 had little immediate effect on the Afro-Goan and Afro-Portuguese families. Just as the formal abolition of the slave trade in 1830 had simply promoted a clandestine trade that lasted into the 20th century, so the abolition of slavery made no immediate change to the unfree status and situation of the peasants in the minor states.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 337, 399. The end of the chikunda The Scramble for Africa In the second half of the 19th century, several European powers had increasing interests in Africa that could challenge Portugal's territorial claims, as it had no effective presence in the area between Angola and Mozambique, and little in many areas within the present borders of those countries.Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 324–6. Although the Portuguese Minister of Marine, Andrade Corvo, who also had responsibility for the overseas territories, attempted bilateral negotiations with Britain in 1879, 1882 and 1884 to fix the Ruo River (now the south- eastern border of Malawi) as the northern limit of Portuguese rule, these talks were overtaken by the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 and its requirement for effective occupation rather than claims based on early discovery or more recent exploration.McCracken (2012), A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, p. 51.Newitt, (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 330-2, 341. In 1880 Manuel António de Sousa, who has previously married a member of the royal family of Barue, which was adjacent to his statelet in Gorongosa, occupied Barue after the death of its ruler. As Barue lay close to both the land route from Sena to Tete and the territory of the da Cruz family, the existence of an unfriendly ruler in Barue, particularly one in alliance with the da Cruz, could block any Portuguese attempts to link Angola and Mozambique. The de Sousa family had been allied with the Portuguese forces attacking Massangano, and the Portuguese government approved of Manuel António's occupation of Barue, although de Sousa did not recognise Barue as part of Mozambique. De Sousa built around thirty aringas in Barue and manned them with his chikunda. In 1884, he again made himself valuable to the government in helping to put down a revolt by supporters the Vas dos Anjos, reportedly sending 10,000 of his chikunda against these rebelsNewitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 338-9. The activities of the Rosário Andrade and Arujo Lobo families along the Upper Zambezi prompted the Portuguese government to lay claim to the Upper Zambezi valley as far as the Sanyati River, now within Zimbabwe. By the late 1870s, both these families had pledged a vague loyalty to the Portuguese Crown, and the Vas dos Anjos had been forced to submit to Portugal in 1884, leaving the da Cruz family at Massangano as the most prominent minor state in the area claimed by Portugal that insisted on its complete independence from the Portuguese Crown. Following the Berlin Conference, this could leave the da Cruz territory open to a British takeover, if it accepted British protection and there were indications it might do so.Isaacman and Isaacman (1976), The Tradition of Resistance in Mozambique, pp. 33-5.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, p. 344. Manuel António de Sousa did not formally claim to be king of Barue but did attempt to extend his territory into the high veldt of Mashonaland in 1886, absorbing the Shona chieftainship of Rupire in the area of the former Mazoe goldfields, which had been productive in the 17th century. However, his chikunda failed to defeat the Mtoko chieftainship in the same area at the start of 1887.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, p. 339-40. De Sousa was distracted from attempting a further attack on Mtoko by a renewal of the war against the da Cruz, who reacted to being virtually surrounded by de Sousa territory by forming an alliance with the exiled relatives of the last Barue king. In 1887, the governor of Manica province and de Sousa agreed to attack Massangano for a fifth time, with an army that mainly consisted of de Sousa's chikunda. Its swift attack led to the rapid fall of Massangano and the subjugation of the da Cruz, whose territory became an integral part of Mozambique. De Sousa then left for Lisbon where, in March 1888, he participated in arrangements that later led to the formation of the Mozambique Company. However, his plans for expansion were soon frustrated by the British South Africa Company, which also laid claim to the Mazoe area.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 340-1. Colonialism established De Sousa's failure to secure more of northern Mashonaland in 1887 allowed Rhodes to contest Portuguese claims in that area. Rhodes' troops arrested de Sousa in 1890 and drove his chikunda out of parts of Barue and Rupire before the definitive Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 assigned virtually all the contested areas to Portugal. However, after being released, de Sousa was unable to re-establish his control of Barue before being killed in his 1892 attempt to do so. Barue reverted to being an African kingdom, and much of de Sousa's original Gorongosa domain fell under the control of his former lieutenants.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 352, 354-5. The 1891 treaty prevented the chikunda of the Rosário Andrade and Arujo Lobo families from raiding in the areas of the Luangwa and Kafue valleys that were now British territory or selling slaves to the Ndebele kingdom after it was conquered by the British South Africa Company in 1893. In Zambezia, the cipais, or armed police, of the Mozambique Company gradually asserted control of area comprised in the company's charter, taking over the chikunda's police and tax gathering roles, but it took until 1902 before the last of the chikunda states came completely under Portuguese controlIsaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda, pp. 280-1.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, p. 368. One of the last such states was the so-called the Military Republic of Maganja da Costa. The Maganja da Costa District had become the stronghold of the Afro-Portuguese Alves da Silva family after the final banning of the legal slave trade in 1830, and contained a number of aringas manned by the family's chikunda.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 253-4, 306 After the deaths of João Bonifacio Alves da Silva in 1861 and of his brother Victorino Romão in 1874, the territory they had controlled evolved into a form of chikuna republic, with effective power devolved to the captains of each aringa. However, by the early 1890s, this chikunda statelet was in decline, following the suppression of the illicit slave trade. In 1897, the Portuguese raised an armed force from its own chikunda to extend colonial rule in the Zambezi valley, and after this was done, Maganja da Costa was itself occupied by Portuguese forces in 1898, when its independence ended.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 370-1 A chieftaincy established by the Caetano Pereira family north of the Zambezi was occupied in 1902, and Barue, which had regained independence in 1891, was occupied by Portuguese forces, also in 1902.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 367-8, 381. Some of the displaced chikunda resorted to banditry, favouring the areas on either side of the Mozambican borders with the Rhodesias. Although Barue had returned to Portuguese rule in 1902, a succession dispute in broke out in 1917, when as many as 15,000 former chikunda revolted against the Portuguese and created aringas in Barue and the Zambezi valley. However, the Portuguese raised a much larger force, mainly of auxiliaries from the Nguni peoples, that broke the back of the rebellion by the end of 1917, although fighting on a smaller scale continued through 1918.Newitt (1995), A History of Mozambique, pp. 417-9. Even before the Barue Revolt, the chikunda ceased to exist as an active institution and most merged into the general population, but their descendant's identification as chikunda has been preserved in a number of remote communities around the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa rivers.Isaacman and Peterson (2003), Making the Chikunda, p. 281. Other former chikunda, together with many Sena people, entered southern Nyasaland after the Portuguese invasion and conquest of Barue in 1901 and 1902 and the introduction by the Portuguese authorities of a system of forced labour there.Isaacman, Mulwafu and Mulwafu (1999), From Slaves to Freedmen, pp. 18-19. The name chikunda or Kunda was mistakenly applied at that time as an ethnic designation applied to all these people from the Zambezi valley of what is now the Zambezia province of Mozambique and parts of Zimbabwe and Zambia who had migrated into the Lower Shire valley, regardless of whether they came from chikunda families or not, and many did not. These people were later more correctly called the Sena from their dominant ethic group.McCracken (2012), A History of Malawi, p. 20.

CV main objectives were opposing what they considered pancatalanism and attacks on valencian identity. This included defending the Valencian language as separate from the Catalan one. CV also opposed foreign immigration to the Valencian Community. History CV was founded as a coalition of various small parties, led by the historic GAV and falangist Juan García Sentandreu. The parties that joined the coalition were the Blasquist Autonomist Party (PBA, that considered itself a continuation of the blasquist political movement of the early 20th century), Regional Party of the Valencian Community (split of Valencian Union), Valencianist Renovation (another split of Valencian Union), Blasquist Republican Party (PRB, that also considered itself a continuation of blasquism). CV also had agreements with other parties in various municipalities, including the national-catholic Spanish Democratic Party, the Valencian Independent Group or the Valencian Independent Organization. In 2005 Identity Kingdom of Valencia joined the coalition, but left in 2007.

The brand was named after the dog Laika who was the first animal launched in space by the USSR on 3 November 1957. History Laika cigarettes were created in 1957 as an honour to Laika the dog. The cigarettes were produced under supervision of the Ministry of Food Industry, in honor of the flight. When the American Lockheed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down over Sverdlovsk, USSR on May 1, 1960 (which would later come to be known as the 1960 U-2 incident), he was offered a Laika by one of the villagers who picked him up on the ground. \\"A filter cigarette, it tasted very much like its American counterparts,\\" Powers wrote in his 1970 memoir, Operation Overflight. \\"There was a package of Kents in my flight-suit pocket. I left them there.\\" he wrote. The cigarettes were mainly sold in the Soviet Union, but they were also sold in the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of Bulgaria and Finland as Duty Free variants. A few TV advertisements were made for Laika cigarettes. It is unknown when the brand was discontinued, but it is speculated that Laika cigarettes were ended when the dissolution of the Soviet Union happened. It is known however, that the cigarettes were sold up until the 1980s.

Marsh was the son of William Marsh, a Blackwell Hall factor, and his wife Anne Fludyer, daughter of Samuel Fludyer, and sister of Sir Samuel Fludyer, 1st Baronet. He married firstly Annabella Graeme, daughter of Thomas Graeme in 1762. The Marsh family was closely linked in business with the Fludyer family and either Marsh or his father was in partnership with the Fludyers. At least by 1775 Marsh was registered as a Blackwall Hall factor. He was living at Battersea Rise when he married as his second wife Frances Elizabeth Bennet on 31 July 1773. At the 1774 general election Marsh was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Chippenham on the Fludyer interest, probably as a stop-gap as Samuel Fludyer's sons were still under age. In Parliament he was considered a person who generally voted with the Government, but occasionally voted with the opposition. He did not stand for Parliament again in 1780. Marsh succeeded his father on 2 March 1778. He died on 18 March 1795, aged 58.

Typically, a collective trust pools assets from corporate and governmental profit sharing, pension and stock bonus plans, and charitable and other tax-exempt trusts. While operating in many respects similar to a mutual fund, a collective trust is not regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but rather is established under Title 12, Section 9.18(a)(2) of the Code of Federal Regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a division within the U.S. Department of the Treasury.12 C.F.R. §9.18(a)(2). CITs have existed since 1927.Coalition of Collective Trust Funds, Collective Investment Trusts (2015). Their size in assets and importance in the retirement and pension fields have grown significantly in recent years. Estimated assets in collective trusts as of the end of 2016 exceeded $1.4 trillion.Cerulli Associates, U.S. Defined Contribution Distribution 2017: Re-Evaluating the Use of CITs in DC Plans (2017). In many ways CITs are similar to mutual funds, and thus have become especially important in the defined contribution/401(k) market, as of 2016 growing to over $1.5 trillion in assets and comprising over 20% of defined contribution plan assets.Steyer, Use of CITs in DC plans booming, rises 68% since 2008, Pensions and Investments (Feb. 22, 2016); SEI, Getting Ahead of the CIT Boom: Aligning Capabilities to Capture DC Market Share (Apr. 16, 2012). Overview Collective trusts are often used in connection with defined benefit plans and, when they can be valued daily, with defined contribution plans as well. Collective trusts generally are excluded from the definition of an “investment company” under Section 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and interests in these funds are generally exempt from registration under Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.15 U.S. Code §§80a-3(c)(11) and 77c(a)(2). In addition, transactions involving interests in collective trusts generally do not require an entity to register as a broker- dealer under Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.15 U.S. Code §78c(a)(12). However, when collective trusts are composed of IRA assets or so- called “Keogh plans,” or marketed to the public, some or all of these securities law exclusions and exemptions may not be available; in these situations, registration under one or more federal securities laws could be required. Although they have been available for decades, early versions of collective trusts provided investors with little access to underlying holdings data and were valued infrequently, typically only once per quarter. As a result, collective trusts were quickly overshadowed by mutual funds, which provide investor friendly features such as daily valuations and greater transparency. However, given the later focus on retirement plan fees and full disclosure, and in light of technological advances, collective trusts have gained market share in the defined benefit and defined contribution markets. Collective trusts pursue a wide variety of investment strategies across the equity and fixed income spectrum. These strategies may be passive (e.g., indexed or model-driven) or actively managed (e.g., pursuing growth or value strategies). In addition, in recent years collective trusts have pursued their investment strategies by employing more innovative investment techniques, such as investing in other investment vehicles or using more innovative investment instruments, such as exchange-traded funds. In addition to equity strategies, collective trusts also pursue a wide range of fixed income strategies, including actively managed strategies, passive strategies and others. Fixed income collective trust funds typically invest primarily in various types of debt instruments, such as Treasury bonds, Treasury bills, corporate bonds, sovereign government bonds, secured and unsecured loans, and different types of derivatives based on these instruments.Lemke and Lins, Collective Trusts and Other Commingled Funds, §4:02 (Law Journal Press, 2015 ed.). Pros and cons Among the advantages of collective trusts versus other investment vehicles are: economies of scale, low operating costs, ease and speed of establishment, pricing and fee flexibility, diversification and access to investment talent. Disadvantages include less transparency than traditional mutual funds, difficulty tracking performance, less oversight of management, and an inability to rollover to an Individual Retirement Account.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collective-investment-fund.asp References Category:Wills and trusts Category:Pensions Category:Banking Category:Financial services Category:Retirement plans in the United States ","title":"Collective trust fund"},{"id":"56155428","text":"The 1969 Paris–Roubaix was the 67th edition of the Paris–Roubaix cycle race and was held on 13 April 1969.

Paquit was assigned as an automatic rifleman in the 3rd Scout Ranger Company of the 1st Scout Ranger Regiment, which was deployed to fight the Moro National Liberation Front faction that continues to recognize Nur Misuari as the MNLF Chairman, during the 2013 Zamboanga City crisis. On 24 September 2013, Paquit died from wounds sustained while providing suppressive fire to enable his fellow soldiers to relocate after his unit came under heavy enemy fire that degraded the available cover. Paquit, at 21 years of age, is the youngest recipient of the Medal of Valor. Zamboanga City crisis The Zamboanga City crisis began on 9 September 2013 when a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front attempted to raise the flag of the self-proclaimed Bangsamoro Republik at Zamboanga City Hall. This short- lived, unrecognized state had earlier declared its independence on 12 August 2013 in Talipao, Sulu. Death Paquit had been wounded in action by shrapnel to his face on 13 September 2013. Despite the injury, he returned to active combat duty shortly after being treated. On 24 September 2013, the third week of the conflict and four days before the cessation of hostilities, the section of the Scout Ranger unit to which Paquit belonged figured in a heavy exchange of fire with the Moro rebels. Paquit adjusted his position for a better line of sight on the enemy and provided suppressive fire as his fellow soldiers relocated to a more covered position. He however, sustained a gunshot injury to the neck that proved fatal. Paquit was conferred the Medal of Valor on 20 December 2013.

Due to it lying across the Gloucester-Cheltenham metropolitan area, responsibility and co-ordination lies with local unitary and district councils as these are the local planning authorities. History The green belt was first drawn up in 1968 with the Gloucestershire Development Plan. The Gloucestershire County Structure Plan in 1981 extended this to include an area north of Cheltenham to protect the green space between Cheltenham and Bishop's Cleeve. No portion was defined within Gloucester as the city boundary is drawn tightly around the urban area.

Bohm, Thomas and Fries, Markus, “The Revised API 682 Mechanical Seal Standard”, Pumps and Systems Magazine, August 29, 2013. The purpose of API 682 is to assist in the selection and operation of end face mechanical seals in centrifugal pumps. It is based on the combined knowledge and experience of seal manufacturers, engineering companies and end users. API 682 is primarily intended for use in the petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries but is often referenced for other types of equipment and industries.Buck, G. S., Huebner, M. B, Thorp, J. M., and Fernandez, C. L. “Advances in Mechanical Sealing – An Introduction to API-682 Second Edition”, Texas A&M; Turbomachinery Symposium, 2003.  Background and development  By the late 1980s, mechanical seals had been accepted as the preferred method for sealing rotating pumps for many years. However, mechanical seal standards were generally buried in other standards such as DIN 24960, ANSI B73 and API 610. All of these standards were primarily pump standards and any references to seals were directed at how mechanical seals would interact with pumps. API 610 is the API standard about centrifugal pumps and is primarily intended for use in the petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries. Although the 1st through 7th Editions of API 610 included specifications for mechanical seals, beginning with the 8th Edition, API 610 defers to API 682 for seal specifications. In the late 1980s a group of refinery equipment engineers and managers began to compare sealing solutions in refinery applications. This group, led by V. R. Dodd of Chevron, came up with a general plan and the American Petroleum Institute (API) agreed to establish a standard for mechanical seals: API 682. A Task Force was formed in 1990 and the first meeting was held in January 1991. This Task Force was composed of fourteen members from various refineries, seal and pump manufacturers. API 682, First Edition, was published in October 1994. One interesting aspect of API 682 is that it includes a strong set of defaults. That is, unless the user indicates otherwise, API 682 makes default choices for specifics such as: * Seal type * Rotating or stationary * Seal arrangement * Seal configuration/orientation * Materials * Piping plan * … many others. Some statements within API 682 are normative, that is, required, whereas others are informative, that is, descriptive but not required. In particular, many of the illustrations are informative. This distinction has not always been apparent to the reader. Subsequent editions of API 682 have been published. The current edition is 4th Edition.  API 682 1st edition  The first edition of API 682 was entirely new although parts of it were extracted from the pump standard API 610 and existing API standard paragraphs. The mission statement for the 1st Edition was: This standard is designed to default to the equipment types most commonly supplied that have a high probability of meeting the objective of at least three years of uninterrupted service while complying with emissions regulations.API Standard 682, First Edition, 1994, “Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. Although this mission statement no longer appears in the standard, it remains the basic principle driving the work of the API 682 Task Force and its relevance remains the same for the 4th Edition as it did for the 1st. In addition to providing requirements for mechanical seals, the 1st Edition of API 682 also provided a guide on how to select the correct seal for a number of common refinery applications. In order to provide this seal selection guide, it was necessary to categorize applications into a number of services: * Non-hydrocarbon * water * sour water * caustics/amines * acids * Non- flashing hydrocarbon * Flashing hydrocarbon. It was also necessary to categorize the many different type seals that were used in these services. Three seal types were designated: * Type A – O-ring pusher * Type B – O-ring metal bellows * Type C – flexible gasket (high temperature) metal bellows. Prior to API 682, 1st Edition, multiple seals were designated as being either “tandem” or “double” seals; however, advances in seal design had rendered these classic terms obsolete. As a result, there was some confusion on how multiple seals were designated. The task force decided to use a more descriptive designation and chose to define dual seal arrangements. A dual seal would be two sets of sealing faces used in the same seal chamber. The fluid between these two sets of sealing faces could be either pressurized or unpressurized. Three standard arrangements were defined: * Arrangement 1 is a single seal * Arrangement 2 is a dual unpressurized seal * Arrangement 3 is a dual pressurized seal. API 682 1st Edition did not include containment seals or dry gas barrier seals. After having defined the services, seal types, and seal arrangements, a series of flowcharts were created to help in selecting a seal type, special materials or design requirements, and supporting piping plans. API 682 seals were to have a high probability of three years of reliable service. In order to prove this, seal performance testing on process fluids under representative pressures and temperatures was required. These performance tests are called “Qualification Tests”. The general idea of the qualification test was to prove that the design was sound. The goal of the qualification test was to simulate a long-term steady state run followed by a process upset. The simulated process upset consisted of pressure changes, temperature changes and included loss of flush. The results of these tests were made available to the purchaser for evaluation. There was no acceptance criteria presented in API 682 1st Edition. In addition to the qualification test of the design, every API 682 seal, whether new or repaired, is to be pressure tested with air before being shipped to the end user.  API 682 2nd edition  One of the major criticisms of API 682 1st Edition was that all the seals were “heavy duty” and therefore expensive with no alternatives for easy services. To some degree, this was intentional and was done in order to reduce inventory, promote familiarity with a limited number of seal types and to increase reliability. Another criticism of API 682 1st Edition was that it considered only API 610 pumps and only refinery applications. The chemical and petrochemical industries routinely use ASME pumps in addition to API 610 pumps. Broadening the scope of pumps covered by API 682 would allow standardized seals to be applied in a greater number of industries. API Standard 682, Second Edition, 2001, “Pumps – Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. In 2nd Edition, the organization of API 682 was changed to conform to ISO standards: This reorganization means that there is no simple cross reference guide between 1st edition and 2nd edition paragraph numbers.  Categories  The 2nd Edition introduced the concept of seal categories. A seal category describes the type of pump into which the seal will be installed, the operating window, the design features, and the testing and documentation requirements. There are three categories designated as Category 1, 2, or 3. Category 1 seals are intended for non-API-610 pumps. This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 500°F (-40°C and 260°C) and pressures to 315 PSI (22 bar). Category 2 seal are intended for API-610 This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 750°F (-40°C and 400°C) and pressures to 615 PSI (42 bar). Category 3 seals are essentially the original seals of 1st Edition and are also intended for API-610 pumps. Category 3 seals are intended for the most demanding applications. This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 750°F (-40°C and 400°C) and pressures to 615 PSI (42 bar). Design features include a distributed flush and floating throttle bushing for single seals. Additional documentation must be also provided.  New seal types  Three new seal types were introduced in the 2nd Edition: dry running containment seals, non- contacting seals, and dual gas barrier seals. Containment seals are the outer seal of Arrangement 2. In the 2nd Edition, containment seals can be used with a liquid buffer fluid, a gas buffer fluid or without a buffer fluid. In the case of a dry running containment seal, the containment seal will be exposed primarily to buffer gas or vaporized process fluid. Such containment seals must therefore be designed for continuous dry running while meeting the reliability goals of the standard. Dry running containment seals may be either contacting or non-contacting. Non-contacting inner seals are also introduced for Arrangement 2. One of the primary targets for non-contacting inner seals is in flashing hydrocarbon services. In some of these services, it is impossible to obtain adequate vapor margins to prevent flashing of the fluid in the seal chamber. This seal will be used with a dry running containment seal and the leakage past the inner seal will be piped to a vapor recovery system. The other new seal type introduced in 2nd Edition was the dry running gas seal used in Arrangement 3. This seal is designed to run on a gas barrier fluid such as nitrogen.  New piping plans  Several new piping plans were introduced in the 2nd Edition. These included additional options for dual pressurized liquid seals as well as new piping plans to support containment seals and dual pressurized gas seals.  New qualification procedures  One of the strengths of the 1st Edition was to provide qualification tests in which seal vendors would be required to prove the suitability of their seals for a given service. The 2nd Edition expanded on these requirements by adding new tests for containment seals and dual gas seals as well as defining acceptance criteria for all tests.  API 682 3rd edition  For all practical purposes, API 682 3rd Edition is the same as 2nd Edition. The completed 2nd Edition was submitted to the ISO Organization for approval as their ISO 21049. At the time, API and ISO had an agreement to jointly issue standards. The ISO Organization made slight editorial changes to 2nd Edition, including correcting typographical errors and unit conversions. Therefore, API had to re-issue a corrected 2nd edition but choose to label it as 3rd edition. API 682 3rd Edition was published in September 2004.API Standard 682, Third Edition, 2004, “Pumps – Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. API and ISO no longer have the agreement to jointly issue standards. The 2004 issue of ISO 21049 is the only issue and plans to update it are unknown.Azibert, H. V., Buck, G. S., Huebner, M. B., “Advancements in Mechanical Sealing – API 682 Fourth Edition”, Texas A&M; Turbomachinery Symposium, 2014.  API 682 4th edition  A twenty-five member task force spent six years updating 3rd Edition to 4th Edition. The 4th Edition of API 682 is organized similarly to the 2nd and 3rd Editions:API Standard 682, Fourth Edition, 2014, “Pumps – Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. # Scope # Normative references # Terms, Definitions, and Symbols # Sealing Systems # General # Design Requirements # Specific Seal Configurations # Accessories # Instrumentation # Inspection, Testing, and Preparation for Shipment # Data Transfer Annexes * Annex A – Recommended Seal Selection Procedure * Annex B – Typical Materials and Material Specifications * Annex C – Mechanical Seals Datasheets * Annex D – Seal Codes * Annex E – Mechanical Seals Data Requirement Forms * Annex F – Technical Tutorials and Illustrative Calculations * Annex G – Standard Piping Plans and Auxiliary Hardware * Annex H – Inspectors’ Checklist for All Seals * Annex I – Seal Qualification Testing  Configurations  Seal Configuration refers to the orientation of the seal components in an assembly. In previous editions, orientations were defined as face-to-back, back-to-back, and face-to-face and these terms are carried over into the 4th Edition. In 4th Edition, any orientation (face to back, back to back, face to face) can be used in a dual seal provided that the design features are appropriate to the functionality of that particular arrangement.  Clearances  Fourth Edition added additional specifications for clearances, placed these requirements in the form of tables and noted that seal components are not to be considered as “shaft catchers” to restrict shaft movement. The minimum clearances specified apply only to equipment within the scope of the standard. Equipment outside that scope, such as non-cartridge seals, older pumps, non-API 610 pumps and certain severe services, might benefit from larger clearances.  Codes  Before API 682, API 610 (the pump standard) used a simple seal code to specify seals. API 682 attempted to use a more comprehensive seal code; however, that code changed with every edition of API 682. The 4th Edition code, described in Annex D, is probably the best to date and includes some concepts and codes from the historical API 610 seal code. The new code uses eight fields: * Seal category * Seal arrangement * Seal type * Containment device * Gasket material * Face material * Approximate shaft size (in millimeters) * Piping plan As an example, the 4th Edition code might be 31B-LIN-075-53A to indicate: * 3 – Category 3 * 1 – Arrangement 1 * B – Type B seal * L – Floating bushing * I – FFKM secondary seals * N – Carbon vs reaction bonded silicon carbide * 075 – installed on a 75 mm shaft * 53A – Plan 53A  Piping plans  Annex G provides illustrations and a short tutorial about each piping plan. As has been the case for every edition, changes were made to the standard piping plans. In particular, the piping plans now default to using transmitters with local indicators as part of the instrumentation. {  - ! API Plan!!

It is a Grade I listed building. The palace was built in the 15th century by Bishop John Alcock however just two towers from the original building remain. He also completed the bishop’s palace (now Wisbech Castle) at Wisbech (where he died in 1500). Bishops over the following centuries expanded and remodelled the palace. During the Second World War the palace was used as a base for the British Red Cross and after this period it became a home for disabled children until its closure in the 1980s. Following this, the palace was purchased on a 99 years lease by the Sue Ryder Care organization although the palace went up for sale again in 2010.

In addition, he was distinguished in surgeries on the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and thyroid. He was renowned for operating on patients from all over the world including Sir Anthony Eden.  Early life  Cattell was born 21 March 1900 in Martins Ferry, Ohio, graduated from Mount Union College with an A.B. degree and subsequently moved to Harvard to study medicine. His family were Quakers and he embraced their beliefs, particularly regarding responsibility and patience, when it came to teaching medicine later on. He was inspired to study medicine from the age of 16 years, principally by his surgeon uncle, Dick Brenneman and the early death of his mother, from breast cancer. During World War I, in 1917, Cattell joined the Army Medical Corps.  Surgical career  After training at St Luke’s Hospital in New York and at the Lahey clinic, in 1927 Cattell became part of the clinical staff. The founder of the clinic, Dr Frank Lehay, died in 1953, resulting in Cattell becoming the new director. He continued this position until illness caused him to retire in 1962. He served as Governor and Regent at the American College of Surgeons, a previous president of the Interstate Postgraduate Medical Association and a director of the Massachusetts division of the American Cancer Society. Cattell was visiting London when Anthony Eden was a matter of surgical decision. A mishap in surgery in 1953 had led to Eden developing surgical complications. Despite Winston Churchill and lord Moran's wishes that reconstructive surgery be performed in London, Horace Evans, 1st Baron Evans managed to persuade further surgery under Cattell in the United States.  Awards  Cattell received an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Boston University. The Buffalo Surgical Society presented him with the Boswell Park Medal and the Harrisburg (Pa.) Surgical Society awarded the George B. Kunkel Surgical Medal.  Family  Cattell was married to Agnes Campbell Matsinger. They had two daughters and three sons. When he died at age 64 years, Cattell also had nine grandchildren.  Legacy  LaheyClinicBurl Cattell's principal legacy will remain his reputation for operating on the 'complex case'.

The text is attributed to Friedrich Spee, and was first printed in the collection Geistlichen Psälterlein (Little sacred psalter) by in Cologne in 1637.Geistliches Psälterlein der Societas Jesu. Peter Grevenbruch, Cöllen 1637. The author was unknown until the 20th century, but research of style and content arrived at the attribution.Joseph Gotzen: Zu Bethlehem geboren. In: Musica sacra 69 (1949), , pp 258–262. The song was printed with a then-popular secular melody in 1638. The song appears in current Catholic and Protestant hymnals.  Melody and settings  The melody was taken from a French chanson which was popular at the time, Une petite feste, with a frivolous text. It is found in a Paris song collection by Pierre Cerveau, Airs mis en musique à quatre parties (1599), and also in Pierre Bonnet's Airs et vilanelles mises en musique à 4 et 5 parties (1600). Spee often wrote sacred texts for secular melodies, intending to fight their \\"pestilent poison\\" (\\"pestilenzisch Gift\\"). The song was printed with the melody in 1638, titled Hertzopffer (The heart's sacrifice) in the Cologne collection Geistlicher Psalter.Geistlicher / Psalter / in welchem / Die ausserlesenste / alt: und newe Kirch- / en und Haussgesang / neben den lieblich- / sten Psalmen Davids / verfasset seindt. Peter Grevenbruch, Cologne 1638, p. 80 f. Probably even sooner, the melody appeared with a text for Kindelwiegen, \\"Nun wiegen wir das Kindlein\\" (Now we rock the little child) in a manuscript tablature, which was written by Henricus Beginiker from 1623. In the 19th century, the hymn became a sacred folksong. Anton Wilhelm von Zuccalmaglio used the same melody, slightly modified, for a lullaby \\"Die Blümelein sie schlafen\\" (The litlle flowers, they sleep) in 1840. This version was adopted by Johannes Brahms as \\"Sandmännchen\\", No. 4 of his 15 Volkskinderlieder, WoO 31 (McCorkle), with a piano accompaniment, first printed in Winterthur by J. Rieter-Biedermann in 1858. The song is part of current German hymnals, in the Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 32, and in the Catholic Gotteslob as GL 239.

He governed under the constant approval of a constitutional expedient, the , which allowed for the suspension of individual rights. In this context, on 14 August, the dentistry student Líber Arce died. He had been shot two days earlier, when the government ordered that a demonstration demanding free transportation for Uruguayan students be put down. Arce, in this way, became Uruguay's first student martyr. One month after his death, the FEUU decided to call a protest demonstration against the government's repressive attacks. This took place on 20 September, at the auditorium of the University of the Republic. The government again responded with force; police had recently received a shipment of riot shotguns ordered from the United States, and they opened fire with these on demonstrators in the University's esplanade.

In that year Schwarzburg- Sondershausen joined Prussia’s internal customs union, the first other state to do so and the first of many to follow. Roghe p 14 When the German Customs Union (Deutscher Zollverein) was initially formed, in the 1830s and 1840s, the motives of the states in joining did not include any particular desire to unite with others to form a wider more powerful entity. The states which joined fought vigorously against any impairment of their full sovereignty. Hence each member had a veto and the union was not permanent, but had to be renewed after 12 years. Each member sought its own economic advantage. Accordingly, the accession of any of the Hanseatic cities of Hamburg, Bremen or Lübeck would have to be on condition that accession served the city's own advantage. A pre-condition of such advantage was that their territory touched directly with that of the Customs Union, which only happened for Hamburg after 1854, when Hanover joined. However Hamburg kept an open frontier with Holstein until 1867, when it was included in the Customs Union on being annexed to Prussia. But, after these accessions, other factors came into play as regards the question of Hamburg joining.Roghe pp. 14-16  Origins of Free Trade in Hamburg In 1189 the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa granted Hamburg the status of an Imperial Free City and tax-free access along the Lower Elbe into the North Sea, free of any tariffs and duties, etc.Verg p. 16 The rights were given orally for Hamburg's support of Frederick's participation in the crusades.Verg, p. 26 The written charter containing these rights, although dated 7 May 1189, actually originated in the 1360s, during a dispute between Hamburg and the Archbishop of Bremen over duties on the Elbe.Deutsche Welle website //www.dw.com/en/hamburg-celebrates-bogus-harbor-anniversary/a-4232908 retrieved April 2017 In the year 1038, the emperor Conrad II granted rights to the Archbishop of Bremen to establish a fair at Stade, a small town on the Elbe 25 miles below Hamburg. This included the right to charge duties on commodities for sale at the fair or landed at Stade for that purpose. The Archbishops abused this privilege and, purporting to have a compulsory market at Stade, exacted a duty on all vessels passing by that town. However, the citizens of Hamburg were exempt by the 1189 grant of Frederick Barbarossa.Hutt, p.19 In 1648 the dominions of the Bremen archbishopric passed to Sweden, who continued this toll as an established customary right. As this was disputed, in 1691 a Convention to regulate the toll was agreed between Hamburg and Sweden. In 1725, the territory and the toll passed to the Electorate (later Kingdom) of Hanover, who enforced the collection with a ship at Brunshausen on the Elbe, at its confluence with the tributary river Schwinge.Hutt, pp.19-21 Despite the exemption for Hamburg's ships, this toll was a great inconvenience to commerce and in 1861 Hanover agreed by treaty to abolish the toll in exchange for compensation, one third provided by Hamburg, one third by Britain and one third by other countries affected.The other states paying compensation were: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Spain, France, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Netherlands, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Sweden and Norway, Lübeck, and Bremen. Thus was brought about toll free access for Hamburg's trade.UK Parliamentary Papers, Vol. 32, Session 5 February - 6 August 1861, printed by Harrison & Sons, London 1861; pp.559 – 574  Bremen’s Proposals for Customs Union  Bremen had similar interests to Hamburg, but because of its more westerly position, it was affected by competition from the Dutch ports. These gained advantage from the trade treaty made in 1839 between the German Customs Union and Holland. To avoid this problem, the Senate of Bremen made two proposals in 1839 and 1842 to extend the Customs Union to the coast. They not only proposed the elimination of the differential duties in favour of Holland, but also the imposition of a protective duty on all goods imported by non-union ships, the establishment of joint consulates for the protection of economic interests abroad, which up to that time could only be very deficient due to the large number of different states, and a common trade flag of all the ships belonging to the union. There was some encouragement from Hamburg initially and Prussia was in favour. However, by 1845, when Prussia stated its position, the Senate of Hamburg expressed itself in a memorandum very vigorously against such ideas. It invoked the free-trade argument that every protective tariff is an unjust burden on the many to benefit the few. In this case, in favour to the union vessels, to which all the consumers of imported articles, as well as the exporting producers, would have to pay monopoly prices for sea transport. The Hamburg Senate did not wish to know anything about a common flag either: it was in the interests of the Hanseatic cities that they retain their own flags, and thus present themselves abroad as neutral trade republics, even if German states went to war with other countries. Likewise, joint consulates were unacceptable as it would be difficult for them to represent the multifarious interests of the participating states.Roghe pp. 17-18  Distance from the coast as a motive for joining the Customs Union  Although 1834 is the official date of the Customs Union's establishment, member states in fact joined at various times over several decades. This was because the benefits of becoming a member of the union increased, both as it grew in economic size and in its geographic spread.Keller, p.1 A state's accession to the Customs Union was related to the distance to the coast because that gave access to international markets. States more distant from the coast joined earlier. Not being a member of the Customs Union mattered more for the states of south Germany, since the external tariff of the Customs Union prevented customs-free access to the coast. Thus, by 1836, all states to the south of Prussia had joined the Customs Union (except Austria, which had its own coast). Keller, p.18 For the southern states the Alps effectively blocked off trade to ports in the south, leaving routes through the Customs Union as the only option.Keller, p.10 In contrast, Hanover formed its own customs union - the “Tax Union” or Steuerverein - in 1834 with Brunswick and with Oldenburg in 1836. The external tariffs on finished goods and overseas raw materials and were below the rates of the Zollverein. Brunswick joined the Zollverein Customs Union in 1842. Hanover finally joined in 1854. Hanover was compensated for this with a premium on its share of customs revenues (as normally calculated). Facing isolation, Oldenburg followed suit in 1854.Ploeckl, p.23 Holstein and Lauenburg were annexed by Prussia after the war in 1866, leading to an accession of their territories into the Customs Union, while Mecklenburg and the city states of Hamburg and Bremen, who engaged heavily in international trade, joined only in 1867 and 1888, respectively.Keller, p. 10  Risk of Dissolution of the Customs Union  Another factor for the Hanseatic states was the suspicion that the Customs Union might not endure, even for the 12 years (renewable) specified in the treaties. If their present trade relations with Scandinavia and Russia were to change after accession to the union because of customs duties, they were not likely to be resumed, should the Customs union be dissolved after a few years, and they returned to the free market. By that time the trade would probably be lost to English competition. This changed with the establishment of the North German Federation in 1867. Instead of the old international treaties, a constitution bound the states together and solidified the union. Thus the fears of the Hanseatic cities had become groundless. But now it became clear that the other grounds alone were strong enough to keep them away from the Customs Union.Roghe, pp. 19-20  Joins North German Federation, 1867  Gustav Kirchenpauer Following the Second Schleswig War of 1864, Schleswig and Holstein became a Prusso-Austrian condominium, with Prussia occupying the former and Austria the latter, but on 8 June 1866, Prussian general Von Manteuffel crossed the river Eider into Holstein, which bordered Hamburg on the north. Having warned Austria he was exercising Prussia's condominate right to establish garrisons in some unoccupied points of Holstein, Austria decided to withdraw from Holstein without forcing a military conflict. However it requested the Federal Diet (Bundestag) of the German Confederation to mobilise militarily against Prussia. Overthrow of the Germanic Confederation by Prussia in 1866, by Sir Alexander Malet, former British Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Frankfort; Publ. Longmans, London 1870; pp 181-184 When the Diet was convoked (11 June), Austria moved that all Federal military contingents except Prussia's be mobilised. Prussia responded by laying before the Diet a scheme of reform of ten articles, the most salient being the exclusion of Austria from the Confederation and the election of a representative body in the remainder; Prussia moved its immediate adoption. The Diet voted on the Austrian proposal on 14 June, which was carried by nine votes to six. As described by Mallet, the large states had one vote each, whilst the smaller states were in groups each with one vote. The free cities combined had one vote, the 17th _voice_ or _Curie_ The three Hanseatic cities, through their joint envoy Friedrich Krüger, voted against the Austrian proposal and made a declaration (formulated by Lübeck) that the events in Holstein did not justify Federal mobilisation, because the danger of immediate military collision had passed. Then on 16 June, Emil von Richthofen, the Prussian envoy to the Hanseatic states, presented to the Hamburg Senate and other German governments an \\"identical note\\" asking for an alliance on the basis of Prussia's reform proposal placed before the Diet and requesting that its troops be placed at the disposal Prussia. On 21 June, representatives of the Hanseatic cities met in Hamburg to discuss the measures demanded by Prussia. Richthofen also took part. Schönhoff, pp. 13-17 On 24 June, Richthofen met two prominent members of the House of Burgesses (Burgerschaft), Isaac Wolffson (former President of that chamber and member of the Right party) and Johannes Halben (leader of the Left party), to inform them of the intended rejection of the Prussian proposals by the Senate. He pointed out that Prussia would not accept a refusal without further action. He mentioned that Prussia would dissolve the Senate and take over the government. The Burgerschaft would remain undisturbed, as would the population, if they kept quiet. Otherwise, 10,000 Prussian troops would occupy the city. Wolffson and Halben reported this to Syndicus Carl Merck, who directed Hamburg's foreign affairs, who now sent Krüger, then in Hamburg, to Richthofen to obtain certainty about the Prussian threats. Merck addressed the Senate on 25 June saying he regarded the policy of Lübeck, which was positive to the Prussian alliance and the threats of Richthofen as particularly serious considerations. He was afraid that, after the accession of all other north German states to the alliance, Hamburg would stand isolated and its independence threatened. Then on 26 June the Senate gave way. Schönhoff, p.19 Merck instructed the Hamburg envoy in London to seek understanding in Britain for the forced connection to Prussia and thereby to preserve the benefit of Hamburg's good relations with Britain. Then, exhausted, a nervous breakdown compelled him to hand over the business to Senator Kirchenpauer. Hamburg, Deutschland und die Welt, 2nd ed. 1952, by Percy Ernst Schramm, publ Hoffmann & Campe; p. 486 When Merck recovered, he tried to convince the Burgerschaft of the inevitability of the decision. The day after the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Königgrätz, on 4 July, the Senate submitted to the Burgerschaft the following urgent requests: (i) assent to the Prussian alliance, (ii) continue of the joint Brigade with Oldenburg, Bremen and Lübeck, and (iii) authorise the costs of mobilisation. The House assented by 113 votes to 54. On 5 July Merck informed Richthofen that Hamburg approved her accession to the Prussian alliance and in August, two battalions of Hamburg troops were sent to Frankfurt to replace some Prussian troops in that area. Overthrow of the Germanic Confederation by Prussia in 1866, by Sir Alexander Malet, former British Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Frankfort; Publ. Longmans, London 1870; p. 369 On 18 August, the Hanseatic Minister-Resident in Berlin, Friedrich Geffcken, signed a treaty between Hamburg and Prussia (of one-year duration) concluding the alliance. Under this treaty, all troops were placed under Prussian supreme command, the two states agreed to hold elections to an imperial parliament and their plenipotentiaries (along with those of other signatories of the alliance) would meet later in Berlin to draft a constitution, as soon as Prussia requested it. Schönhoff, pp. 24-25 This request was made in December 1866 and Senator Kirchenpauer was sent to represent Hamburg. On 15 December, the draft constitution was presented to the plenipotentiaries assembled in Berlin. Schönhoff, pp. 27-29 Kirchenpauer wrote: > \\"The draft carries the guise of a federation, not a constitution of a single > state.

LIT Verlag Münster, 2000; > page 45 The Hamburg Senate desired to retain its own 279 consulates or, at least, participate in the appointment of consuls and retain the right of direct correspondence and instruction. Hamburg's commercial consuls had the advantage of being more established in the various states and of having good relations with their leading personalities. Also, Hamburg's neutrality was necessary for its commercial interests, and since it had not been allied with any major power, it remained unmolested by all their quarrels. Schönhoff, p. 36 But Bismarck claimed the Hanseatic cities were accorded a particularly favourable position, but instead of an appreciation of this, Kirchenpauer treated the proposals with \\"the narrowest particularism, a clinging to special institutions, eschewing the handling of common burdens\\", more so than any of the monarchies. Bismarck said that Prussia attempted to compromise as far as possible, but unity had to be pursued, not the preservation of exceptional rights. Merck should therefore give instructions to Hamburg's representative which are compatible with the purpose intended by Prussia. Bismarck supported this intimidation by a press campaign against Kirchenpauer, also by halting the negotiations on Hamburg's postal arrangements. Schönhoff, p. 39 In this tense situation, the Senate thought it better to refrain from responding to a telegram from Bismarck and instead send a reply already drafted by Merck. Eventually, the negotiations of the north German plenipotentiaries were concluded in February 1867 and the Senate had to decide whether or not to approve the draft constitution. It agreed that a general rejection of the Constitution was precluded, since the consequences of such a step could not be overlooked. Schönhoff, p. 43 After changes to the draft constitution by the provisional north German parliament, the plenipotentiaries approved the amended constitution on 16 April 16. The Senate's message to the Burgerschaft (drafted by Kirchenpauer) asked them to consent, even though it did not correspond to the wishes of all concerned. The Hamburg Senate, like others, had to give up essential parts of its state independence, but this was necessary to achieve an agreement. The Burgerschaft ratified the constitution on 15 May 15, 1867 and it came into force on 1 July 1, 1867, founding the North German Federation. Schönhoff, p. 44 Johannes Versmann” in General German Biography(ADB ) //de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Versmann,_Johannes&oldid;=2513155 Retrieved 4 May 2017  Constitution of the North German Federation  Although Hamburg joined the North German Federation, it remained outside the Customs Union. The federation's constitution included special arrangements for Hamburg and the other Hanseatic cities: Article 34: The Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg with appropriate districts for this purpose or their surrounding area, shall remain as free ports outside the Community customs border until they apply for their inclusion in the same. Article 38: The yield of the customs duties and the excise duties specified in Art. 35 flows into the Federal Treasury. Following clauses defining “yield”, it continued: The areas outside the Community customs border contribute to federal expenditure through the payment of an Aversum (a specific discretionary lump sum). Also Article 35 specified that the Federation had exclusive charge of measures required in areas outside the Customs Union to secure the common customs border.Constitution of the North German Federation //de.wikisource.org/wiki/Verfassung_des_Norddeutschen_Bundes Retrieved Dec 2017  The Aversum  After the founding of the North German Federation, Kirchenpauer and Versmann went to Berlin in the summer of 1867 to negotiate the Aversum. The North German Federation was funded by (a) customs duties forming the common external tariff and (b) consumption taxes (tax on spending on goods and services). Non-members of the Customs Union instead paid a compensatory lump sum into the Federal Treasury, which was legally regarded as a complete substitute for the indirect taxes which had not been paid. The Aversum consisted of two parts. Firstly, each year the total customs and consumption tax income was divided by the population of the Customs Union, then applied pro rata to the population of each Hanseatic city living outside the customs line. Secondly, a supplement was added, per head of the population of these free zones.Roghe, p.23 The Aversum supplement was in 1867 set at 2.21 marks per inhabitant, 1872 to 3 marks per capita, and from 1880 to 5 marks, after the Customs Union adopted a high tariff. The Aversum, therefore, was directly dependent on level of customs duties and tax rates. The provisions governing the payment of the Aversum justified the full voting rights of Hamburg and Bremen in the North German Federation. It was up to city states how they wanted to raise these sums. On account of its special circumstances, Lübeck found it well in 1868 to submit the application as foreseen in Article 34 and join the Customs Union.Roghe, p.24  Relations with the Customs Union after 1867  In one respect the tariff treatment of the Hanseatic cities differed from that of the rest of the foreign countries. Offices of the Customs Union were set up in the free areas of Hamburg and Bremen to perform customs clearance, avoiding the need for it at the destination or an intermediate station.Roghe, p.21 The fact that an area is excluded from the customs frontier does not in itself mean that it must also be outside the tax frontier. For example, the Imperial Stamp Duty, which was not a consumption tax, was applied in the Hanseatic states as well as the Customs Union. For consumption taxes the Hanseatic cities were treated like other foreign states. The brandy or sugar supplier in the Customs Union received an export remuneration upon dispatch to Hamburg. This was passed on to the Hamburg consumer who received the Customs Union product free of Customs Union tax and, the reduction was not negated by any high import tariff or consumption tax levied by Hamburg. Thus Hamburg consumers had lower prices than consumers within the union.Roghe, p.22 The German imperial constitution of 1871 brought no change in the legal situation of Hamburg and Bremen. Article 34 (and related provisions) went into the new constitution.  Customs frontier  City state of Hamburg 1867-1888. Free zone outside the Customs Union: yellow. Areas within the Customs Union: pink After Hamburg had agreed to the constitution of the North German Federation, negotiations were held between November 1867 and March 1868 on the size of the free area. It was agreed that this would cover the Hamburg urban area, but not the outlying areas, including Ritzebuttel, Bergedorf and the Vierland (which were a condominium with Lübeck until January 1868), Waldvörfer, and some Elbe islands. The excluded area, covering about 130 square miles with 25,000 inhabitants, now fell inside to the Customs Union.Borowsky, p.112 The free area outside the customs barrier was only 28 square miles, but had a population of about 475,000. The 1868 arrangement required a customs cordon all around the city.“The Last of the German Free Ports” The Times (London) 13 Oct 1888; p.8 The customs line was drawn according as the locality facilitated customs control. Although Holstein had been annexed by Prussia in 1866, Altona in Holstein remained outside the Customs Union frontier because it flowed completely with the Hamburg urban area. Already in 1853 Altona was excised from the Danish customs area in Holstein and treated as part of Hamburg for the purposes of raising duty.Altona Schwere Jahre retrieved Dec 2017 www.hamburg.de/altona/schwere- jahre/ However, the few and low tariffs of Hanover, Oldenburg, Denmark, and Mecklenburg had caused no difficulties. In 1867 Altona remained with Hamburg for Customs purposes, but now the customs border was that around a protective tariff regime.Roghe, p.27 In 1853, between Ottensen and Altona, a customs border was established, which ran along the later Haubachstrasse Map of Altona 1888, retrieved Dec 2017 //christian- terstegge.de/hamburg/karten_altona/files/1888_altona_450dpi.jpeg This continued under the 1867 arrangement, so Ottensen was in the economic territory of the Customs Union, but not Altona and Hamburg. As a result, Hamburg enterprises who wished to sell into the Customs Union set-up sites in Ottensen, which then developed into a major industrial location. Within 60 years, the population grew sixteen-fold, from 2,411 in 1840, to 37,738 in 1900. Altona Schwere Jahre retrieved Dec 2017 www.hamburg.de/altona/schwere- jahre/ Enterprises needing to achieve low prices for the world market, and also servicing the not insignificant demand of the inhabitants of the Hamburg- Altona district (578,000 inhabitants in 1885), would site themselves in the free area. Branches of the same company were often sited both within and without the customs border.Roghe, p.30 The Hamburg-Holstein border cut through houses, roads and gardens and so customs control would have been extremely difficult. This was the reason for outlying areas of Hamburg being incorporated within the customs frontier. Also outside the Customs Union was most of Wandsbek, a salient of Holstein into the Hamburg urban area.“Hamburg Im Bundesrat: Die Mitwirkung Hamburgs an Der Bildung Des Reichswillens 1867-1890”, by Hans-Georg Schönhoff, Publ. Hamburg, 1967;Page 107  End of Hamburg’s own currency  Until 1873 Hamburg had its own currency, the Hamburg Mark Courant, divided into 16 schillings, itself divided into 12 pfennig (pence). On 15 February 1873, accounts were converted to the new single currency of the new empire, at a fixed exchange rate of 1.2 imperial Marks to the Hamburg Mark. After a transition period of almost 2 years, the old coins were withdrawn and the new currency became the sole means of payment on 1 January 1875. The senate had delayed the introduction of the new currency after the founding of the empire in 1871, because they feared that the new money would result in a further loss of Hamburg's sovereignty. Kirchenpauer, who was the long-standing envoy of the city at the Federal Council, fought for the special position of Hamburg. But, in October 1872, the empire announced it would take 30 million Hamburg Marks from the Hamburg bank to ease the effect of the change and the Senate gave in.“Farewell to familiar money”, by Uwe Bahnsen, publ. 3 Feb 2013 www.welt.de/print/wams/hamburg/article113335435/Abschied-vom-vertrauten- Geld.html retrieved Dec 2017  The two sides in Hamburg on the Accession question 1877-81  The majority of Hamburg's wholesale merchants were opposed to joining the Customs Union and in favour of the maintenance of free trade. This camp included shipping companies, entrepot traders, overseas exporters, the importers of goods into Hamburg that would have been subject to duty in the Customs Union, such as coffee and tea. These were imported in bulk, then repackaged, processed, or refined in Hamburg. The Chamber of Commerce, the stock exchange and the Senate were all decisively for free trade. On the other hand, there were supporters of joining the Customs Union from the ranks of wholesalers of goods produced within the Customs Union, also local tradesmen, certain branches of Hamburg industry (which was anyway a small component of the economy), retail tradesmen, especially those located near the Customs Union borders. For these groups, the customs cordon made their trade with the union more difficult. Important branches of industry therefore moved from Hamburg to adjacent parts of the Customs Union area. For example, tobacco companies with a workforce of 3,000 settled in Ottensen. These pro-Customs Union protagonists on 25 May 1880 founded the Hamburger Zoll Anchluss party, which advocated the city joining the Customs Union territory but at the same time setting-up a smaller free port district. Supporters included the Ohlendorff family who owed their nobility to Prussia.Borowsky, pp.112-114 Another group of merchants spoke out for the Customs Union because they held interests in industrial companies within the Customs Union. Gustav Godeffroy, a senator, supported joining the Customs Union in 1877/78 with the publicly stated grounds that he had acquired holdings in several coal pits of Westphalia (in Prussia) and that the protection interests of this industry made him a supporter. On 31 October 31, 1880, 32 merchants wrote to the Minister President of Prussia and Imperial Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, advocating the accession of Hamburg but with the formation of a free port district. Thus, the alternatives had shifted; it was no longer a question of free trade city or complete annexation to the Customs Union, but instead the alternatives of free trade throughout the city or in a smaller free port area. As was to be expected, the actions of the 32 merchants unleashed a storm of indignation in Hamburg. In the stock exchange, a petition received 1,730 signatures asserting \\"that the preservation of the freedom of Hamburg is imperative both in the national interest of the entire fatherland and in Hamburg's interest”.  Pressure to join the Customs Union starting in 1879  In the first decade of the new federation's existence, Bismarck largely left trade policy in the hands of his deputy the liberal-minded President of the Chancellery Rudolf von Delbrück. Delbrück pursued a policy of making trade as free as possible and reduced the protective tariffs of the Customs Union. After the Franco-Prussian War, French war indemnities reduced the need for customs revenues. However, Delbrück resigned in April 1876 over disagreements with Bismarck. In 1875, the iron industry sought the retention of the 1876 expiring tariffs of the Customs Union. Bismarck now intervened - in addition to increasing individual customs duties and taxes, he would also replace the previously low financial tariffs by introducing a protective duty system. This change in customs policy would have the dual advantage of protection of domestic industry against cheap foreign imports, while increasing the revenue of the empire. Hamburg Im Bundesrat: Die Mitwirkung Hamburgs an Der Bildung Des Reichswillens 1867-1890, by Hans-Georg Schönhoff, publ H Christians, Hamburg 1967; p.89 Industrial and agricultural interests were decisive. Only Hamburg, Bremen, and Oldenburg voted against Bismarck's proposals in the Federal Council. The Hamburg Chamber of Commerce justified Hamburg's opposition saying they would make the entire domestic consumption more expensive, increase costs for industry and ultimately would challenge other countries to counter-measures.Borowsky, p.110 Two main causes led to the high tariff policy. Firstly, imperial expenses, particularly military, were increasing and Bismarck decided to get revenue by increasing import duties rather than by raising direct taxes. Customs duties were paid directly to the central authorities. Alternatively the contributions made by the individual states could be increased, but they would need to raise the sums by persuading their legislatures to raise direct taxation. Politically it was easier raise the tariff. Secondly, a fall in agricultural prices led the agrarian interest, which previously opposed high duties on manufactures, to combine with industrialists to demand a general increase in the tariff. The high tariff heightened the disparity with Hamburg and the Chancellor felt that Hamburg's opt-outs could no longer remain.Henderson, p.332 On May 20, 1879, the Chancellor asked the Hamburg Senate whether they would accede to the Customs Union as provided for in Article 34 of the Constitution. The Senate rejected this request citing the effect on the city's maritime trade, especially with the new high tariff policy. Then the Chancellor began to apply pressure. On 19 April 19, 1880, Prussia applied to the Federal Council for the inclusion of Altona in Prussia and St. Pauli in Hamburg in the Customs Union territory. Hamburg was not able to do anything about the inclusion of Altona, and the request for St. Pauli was felt as a deliberate snub. In a mass petition with 60,000 signatures and in well-attended meetings the Hamburgers expressed their protest against the Chancellor's actions. On 25 February 1881, there was a further application to the Federal Council for the inclusion of the Wandsbek salient, hitherto part of the free trade zone around Hamburg. Prussia said it was appropriate to integrate Wandsbek completely into the Customs Union territory and align the customs border with the political frontier of Prussia. On 2 April 1881, the Federal Council decided to annex Wandsbek. The Hamburg merchants feared their business would be seriously affected, while the citizens knew the cost of living would rise considerably. It was feared that the city would cease to be the great international distributing centre which it had been for so long. As a free port Hamburg could receive into its warehouses, and reship free of duty, goods imported from England and other countries at a cheaper rate than could be done with similar goods produced in Germany. Its own large population could afford to supply their wants from foreign markets free of all protective duties. The 7,000 ships that entered the port annually with the needs of themselves and their crews represented an enormous sum. Bismarck's first attempt to coerce Hamburg achieved little – its opposition to economic union remained as firm as ever. On 9 December 1880, George Annesley, the British Consul-General, reported \\"it may be clearly stated that there is no question whatever of Hamburg voluntarily joining the Zollverein; such a course at present is hardly discussed\\".Henderson, p.333 But Bismarck was determined. He now proposed intercepting goods being transported to Hamburg along the lower Elbe, in order to levy a duty, effectively a re- introduction of the Stade tolls without the exemptions. Legally, the Elbe below Hamburg was the same as the open sea and goods could be sent to and from Hamburg without hindrance. But if such duties were levied, Hamburg's entrepôt trade would be threatened. Hamburg protested vigorously against this infringement of ancient rights that guaranteed its free access to the open sea. But the Federal Council backed Bismarck's policy. On April 27, 1880 Versmann replaced Kirchenpauer as plenipotentiary to the Federal Council in Berlin. With prudence he raised reservations from Hamburg's point of view regarding the policy of Bismarck to annex Hamburg to the Customs Union.  Submits to Chancellor’s policy  By the middle of 1880, however, it was clear to all the insiders that an absolute opposition to Bismarck's plans would be pointless. On 29 June 1880, the Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Senate stating: > “Hamburg has an opponent, who pursues his aims without recklessness, as long > as he considers them to be the right one, an opponent whom we naturally > cannot cope with, the opinion of which is not to be misjudged, whether it be > in a political or commercial sense”. By a majority of 16 to 5, it called on the Senate to set up a programme for future negotiations with Prussia and demand a smaller free trade district, including facilities for Hamburg's export industry. The Senate was still largely against the Customs Union. The general public did not hear of the decision of the Chamber of Commerce, but rather the impression was expressed that the Chamber of Commerce still wanted to maintain the status of Hamburg as a free port city. With these double-tracked tactics, Senator Versmann and the Chamber of Commerce pursued the goal of strengthening the Hamburg position against Bismarck. The 1,730 name petition was used in this context. These tactics were essentially successful.Borowsky, p.114-115 In December 1880 and January 1881, Versmann, O’Swald and Hugo Roeloffs held \\"informational discussions\\" with the Prussian Superior Customs Inspector Klostermann and the Prussian Finance Minister Karl Hermann Bitter. In April 1881 they started actual negotiations in Berlin. Versmann, O'Swald and Dr. Friedrich Krüger (Hanseatic minister (envoy) to Berlin) negotiated the definitive conclusion of the agreement. On 25 May 1881 an agreement was signed between Prussian Finance Minister Bitter and the State Secretary of the imperial Treasury, on the one hand, Hamburg's Plenipotentiary Senators Versmann and O'Swald, and the envoy of the Hanseatic states in Berlin Dr. Krüger, on the other. It stated that Hamburg is ready to join the Customs Union with all its territory, but excluding a permanent free port district which it specified. For this district, Article 34 would still apply, thus the freedoms of that district could not be abolished or restricted without Hamburg's approval. On 3 June 1881 the Senate voted in favour, despite the opposition of Kirchenpauer. On 15 June 1881, the resolution of the Senate was discussed in the Burgerschaft. There was a seven-hour session (7 pm - 2 am). Carl Petersen, the Commissioner for the Senate, said Hamburg would “still remain the emporium for the wide world of the German Fatherland”, to which she would be more closely united than ever. The proposal of the Senate was agreed to by 106 votes against 46. It was decided it should take effect in October 1888. The Federal Council approved the agreement on 25 June 1881.  Preparations for accession 1881-88  In March 1882 the Senate formed a seven-member commission, including Versmann, for the preparation of the accession to the Customs Union including the construction of the free port. On 21 February 1883 the Burgerschaft approved the plans, which included a canal to allow local navigation on the Elbe without passing through the remaining free trade zone. In order to implement the project, some 24,000 inhabitants of the affected districts had to be relocated and land worth 54.5 million marks had to be acquired. Later, when the free port was enlarged, another 25,000 inhabitants had to be resettled.Borowsky, p.116 With the free port, as an emporium and for transit purposes, Hamburg would provide the same facilities as before, while merchandise intended for the interior would pay duty at the port itself, instead of at the boundaries of the city. In 1885 the HFLG (Hamburger Freihafen-Lagerhaus Gesellschaft) was founded for the construction and impartial leasing of storage facilities in the Hamburg Free port (free trade zone). In the period remaining prior to Hamburg's accession to the Customs Union in 1888, sufficient space had to be created on the free port area for the storage and processing of the goods, which had previously been spread over the entire urban area of Hamburg.History of the Speicherstadt on web site of the HHLA - formerly known as HFLG site: hhla.de/de/historie/speicherstadt/geschichte.html Retrieved Jan 2018 After Prussian State Railways acquired the Berlin-Hamburg Railway, the director Adolf Götting lost his position. Roeloffs recommended his appointment as operational manager of HFLG and Götting led the HFLG very successfully for over 25 years. Hamburg and the Freeport - Economy and Society 1888–-1914, by Peter Borowsky, publ Hamburg University Press, Hamburg, 2005; p.32  Accession in October 1888  On 15 October 1888, Hamburg joined the Customs Union and on 29 October the new free port area was inaugurated in the presence of Emperor Wilhelm II.Borowsky, p.119  Consequences  The consequences of the Customs Union were immediately felt for Hamburg consumers: the prices of many consumables rose. A pamphlet published on 15 October 1888, under the heading \\"Hamburger Weh\\" stated:Borowsky, p.119-121 > \\"Instead of the coffee we drink today, we'll be waving, bells, as in Saxony. > Instead of imported goods, you will smoke a cigar from the dear Palatine > country. If you also feel a little discomfort, rebelliously your stomach > will also smell\\". The Hamburg wholesale merchants were sceptics. However it became apparent that the founding of the free port district was of great benefit, for not only could free trade continue much as before, but the rebuilt harbour provided the most modern facilities and a great increase in capacity. This assisted economic development of the rest of the city. As this was now behind the protective external tariff of the Custom Union, industrial enterprises that were previously uncompetitive, now grew extensively. The citizens of Hamburg were driven to make use of articles of German origin much more freely than before, as many of them were cheaper than corresponding foreign articles which were now weighted with a Customs duty. As predicted, the new conditions favoured the development of manufactures in Hamburg itself. With the free port, Hamburg became the leading port in continental Europe and the world's fourth largest after New York, London and Liverpool. This continued the increase of trade prior to the accession, which in 1873- 1887 grew by 44.2%. Nevertheless, outside the Customs Union, the growth of Antwerp and Rotterdam was faster than that of Hamburg in this period and both surpassed Hamburg after the First World War. Being still outside the Customs Union, the structure of cargo handling in the free port did not change through the accession: Hamburg remained Germany's industrial port, mainly importing raw materials and foodstuffs and exporting processed products. The rapid growth of the entrepôt trade demanded a permanent expansion of the free port. In preparation for its inclusion in the Customs Union, the state of Hamburg was obliged to carry out the following proceedings: The whole city was divided into a large number of small districts. Every citizen paying above a certain moderate rent had to make an inventory of all articles liable to Customs duties - wines, spirits, sugar, coffee, tobacco, and many other articles. On all these articles a certain limited amount of duty was levied on and after Monday 15 October 1888. All articles above 70 bottles of wine, 20 bottles of spirits, 6 lb. of tobacco, 30 lb. of coffee, and so on, were made liable to duty. Thousands of Customs officers made house-to-house visits to test the correctness of the inventories furnished. Thus consumers were prevented from hoarding products enough to last 1 or 2 months or more. Living costs were anticipated to be at least 15% higher than before. In 1889 it was reported that rents were rising in consequence of the cost of living having risen by 25% since the incorporation of Hamburg in the Customs Union.“A British Consulate Barricaded” The Times (London) 16 Mar 1889; p.6 Effects of the incorporation of Hamburg were reported by British Consul-General. There was an increase in shipping, although it was not clear whether this could be attributed to incorporation or to other causes, but Hamburg shipping had not suffered from the change. There was a manifest benefit to retail businesses trading with the interior and also manufacturing. Also works by Prussian Railways helped to direct trade to Hamburg and other ports within the Customs Union, at the expense of those outside. The new harbour facilities, although vast, were, still insufficient to meet the demand.“At a meeting of the Imperial Institute” The Times (London) 16 May 1891; p.7 900,000 inhabitants of Hamburg had now to pay the Customs Union duties, adding about 25 per cent on the cost of imports.Clapp, p.47 Also, Hamburg had to pay for 1,700 men to guard the free port customs boundary.  Free Port  Free Port area in 1888 Because the main harbour had to remain outside the Customs Union, it was rebuilt, isolated from the rest of the city. The imperial authorities agreed fund 40 million marks of the construction costs, while 150 million marks was borne by Hamburg. This Free Port consisted of the following areas. A peninsula on the north bank of the Elbe (Sandtorhafen and Grasbrookhafen), as well as the island of Kehrwieder. As the Free Port was not allowed to have residents, 1,000 property owners were expropriated and 24,000 people made homeless. On the South Bank of the Elbe 1,200 acres of marsh land were purchased and new basins constructed there. A “customs canal” was constructed separating the north bank area from the city and allowing local navigation on the Elbe to avoid passing through the customs frontier. The free port was extended several times. Initially it had an area of 3.9 sq. milesEncyclopedia Britannica 1912, Hamburg article By 1970 it had an area of 5.6 sq. miles.Free Trade Zones and Related Facilities Abroad, by US Dept of Commerce, Pub. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., July 1970; Hamburg article (within Germany section) The free port was closed on 1 January 2013, at which time it had an area of 6.3 sq. miles, which was 23% of the port area.History of the Hamburg Free Port www.hamburg.de/wirtschaft/aufloesung-freihafen-geschichte-freihafen retrieved Dec 2017 The later additions covered several basins and onshore installations west of the Kohlbrand. Unlike other free ports in Germany, the Hamburg free zone had manufacturing, assembly and other processing operations, whether or not using imported materials. The Hamburg Free Port administration would give approval depending on whether the end products were primarily, although not necessarily exclusively, for re-export. Processing might be approved, even if it should lead to placement of goods in a more favourable tariff classification than at the time of entry into the zone. Customs surveillance was carried out by the Freihafenamt (Free Port Authority), rather than by the regular customs department. This authority, an arm of the state of Hamburg, which owned the land, leased the land in the free zone to private operators. The old Free Port section included most of the city's shipyards. The zone's newer area west of the Kohlbrand included petroleum storage and extensive container terminal facilities. The Free Port had numerous warehouses, transit sheds, grain handling facilities, facilities to handle tropical fruit, raw tobacco, coffee, fish, edible oils, timber, coal and other products.

The lot was formerly occupied by the Lincoln Square Synagogue. Upon completion, the tower will contain 112 condominiums. The building stands as the tallest building on the Upper West Side after topping out at 51 stories in August 2019. 50 West 66th Street will be taller if completed as planned in 2021. Buildings of comparable size exist within a thousand feet to the south and east, including Tower 67 and the Park Millennium, which stand 49 and 47 stories tall, respectively. However, in February 2020, a state judge ruled that several upper floors would have to be removed. History Planning The site, formerly a synagogue constructed in 1971, was purchased by the developers for $275 million in October 2015. The building's design was officially unveiled in June 2016 and permits for the development were filed two months later in September 2016. Despite the project's initial lot spanning just , the developers expanded the zoning lot to over by purchasing the development rights from parking lots at the neighboring Lincoln Towers. This allowed the project to aggregate floor area limits and build a much larger project upon the small site. Opposition and legal challenges In May 2017, two community groups began the first organized opposition to the tower's development, claiming that the building's zoning lot was illegal and could not encompass the additional development rights from the Lincoln Towers. Local New York City Council member Helen Rosenthal and Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer endorsed the effort and a formal challenge was filed with the New York City Department of Buildings on May 15. In June, the Department of Buildings halted new permit issuance for the site until the challenge could be reviewed and ruled on. At the end of June, the Department of Buildings filed a \\"Notice to Revoke\\" against the developers, meaning that the permit would be revoked unless the developers responded and solved issues that the Department had identified. Two weeks later, the Department ruled that the challenge had merit and rescinded the development's permit until the zoning lot was changed to comply with the law. By the end of September, the developers had responded to the Department of Building's concerns and demonstrated conformance with the law without changing the scope of the project. The development received new construction permits on September 27, allowing the developers to begin excavation and foundation work for the building. However, in November the two community groups filed an appeal with the Board of Standards and Appeals, part of the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, again challenging the legality of the development's zoning lot. In February 2018, the local Community Board 7 noted its displeasure with the building, although legally the board had no power to stop or alter the development. On March 9, the assistant general counsel of the Department of Buildings sent a letter to the Board of Standards and Appeals which acknowledged that the permits issued for the development was \\"based on an incorrect interpretation of the Zoning Resolution.\\" In July the Board of Standards and Appeals voted 3-1 to uphold the development's permit after which a community group moved to sue the Board in court. Financing, construction, and continuing legal challenges At the end of September, the project's crane was installed. Shortly after installation, the Department of Buildings ordered work to stop at the site until the developer installed sidewalk sheds to protect pedestrians from potential falling debris from the crane. Despite progress on the construction, a lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court was filed by the Municipal Art Society in October to appeal the Board of Standards and Appeals' decision from July. Several prominent local politicians including New York State Assembly members Linda Rosenthal and Richard N. Gottfried as well as Congressman Jerry Nadler supported the lawsuit. In November, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank provided a $425.8 million loan to finance construction of the development. The New York Supreme Court ruled in March 2019 that the Board of Standards and Appeals had improperly applied the law and ordered the Board to review the project again. However, the court stopped short of revoking the development's permits which allowed construction to continue. Another motion for a temporary restraining order, which would have stopped work on the site, was denied in early April. A request for a preliminary injunction at the end of April was also denied, allowing construction to progress while the Board of Standards and Appeals reviewed the zoning challenge. By that time, the building had reached roughly 25 stories in height. At the end of June 2019, the Board of Standards and Appeals reaffirmed the building's permits after construction had reached the 40th floor. At the end of July 2019, the Municipal Art Society filed another lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court to appeal the decision and attempt to stop the building's development, again alleging that the Board had improperly applied the zoning law when approving the building's permits. The building topped-out the following month, though work on the crown and facade proceeded through late 2019. 2020 permit revocation On February 17, 2020, New York Supreme Court Justice W. Franc Perry ruled that the existing permit for 200 Amsterdam had been issued, as reported by Gothamist, \\"based on a 39-sided 'gerrymandered lot' that abused zoning protocol\\", and was therefore issued in error by the Department of Buildings, which was ordered to revoke the permit. The ruling necessitates that \\"potentially 20 or more\\" newly constructed floors be removed.

Work Garner moved to New York in 2014 after she graduated from Rhode Island School of Design. She attended the Skowhegan School for Painting and Sculpture. Garner's body of work includes, \\"corporeal, gushy, colorful, complex sculptures that incorporate braiding hair, silicone, Vaseline, condoms, and various other manipulated and found materials to create medically and historically informed expressions of black-female physicality\\". The following year, Garner was an artist-in-residence at the Henry Street Settlement in downtown Manhattan.  Sculptures  In 2016, Garner held two simultaneous solo-exhibitions in New York. At Essex Flowers, Removing the Veil: Vanity as Material for Incision, the artist exhibited several sculptures that addressed beauty practices and the body. The sculptural works on view mimic flesh using silicone, and included a hairy mass with Swarovski crystals, pearls, hair weaves, and more suspended in a cage, and a portrait of a woman torn from a magazine situated in a dissection tray. In Wave Hill, Garner exhibited Flora: Viscera, an exhibition of works that resembled botched surgeries. Garner was also featured in a group show curated by New York artist Derrick Adams at Volta Art Fair in New York. In early 2017, ARTnews announced Garner as one of the artists selected for the Socrates Annual, previously known as the Emerging Artist Fellowship Exhibition, at Socrates Sculpture Park. During the summer of 2017, Garner held a solo-exhibition titled, Doctor's Hours, at Larrie gallery. The show exhibited several sculptural works, a number of drawings, and a library containing selected books that inspired the exhibition, such as In the Flesh: The Cultural Politics of Body Modification by Victoria Pitts-Taylor and The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. Garner curated her first New York show the same summer. Titled Stranger Things, the group- exhibition at Outpost Artists Resources explored various themes of, \\"intimacy, hygiene, latent sexuality, and racialized violence\\" as noted by Vanessa Thrill at Artforum. Artists in the show included Jes Fan, Kenya (Robinson), Tamara Santibañez, Erik Ferguson, Nakeya Brown, Ted Mineo, and Elliott Jerome Brown, Jr. In the fall of 2017, Garner held a two-person exhibition at Pioneer Works, titled White Man on A Pedestal, with Kenya (Robinson). The large-scale exhibition included new sculptural works, including a large-sized 3-D rendered J. Marion Sims all in red and a number of fleshy works hanging as meat racks, gynecological tools, and an army of men by (Robinson). The exhibition began with a performance by (Robinson), titled #WHITEMANINMYPOCKET, and ended with a performance by Garner, titled Purge. The exhibition interrogated the legacy of Sims, known colloquially as the \\"Father of Modern Gynecology\\", who has fallen largely out of favor in the medical community for his brutal mistreatment and experimentation on black female bodies. Writer and critic William J. Simmons wrote in Cultured Magazine that the show, \\"follows that Garner's work is as historically informed as it is visually arresting,\\" and that \\"there is a wealth of research and documentation that takes her imagery out of the realm of shock and into a deeper appeal\\". In the spring of 2019, Garner created a showcase entitled She is Risen. This showcase was held at JTT in New York. It featured several sculptures, one of which honored Betsy Ross and Betsey titled, \\"Betsey's Flag.\\" The sculpture is a flag shape in which one side features a flag to look like the original made by Betsy Ross, and the other side features flesh, blood, fat cells, and muscle tissue. The 16 stars on the flag were to represent the amount of cots within the lab of J. Marion Sims instead of the 16 states. Another piece, entitled, \\"Henrietta: After the Harvest\\" was in honor of Henrietta Lacks, which depicted a cervix which had undergone radiation treatment and also contained black bands to represent the radiation tubes placed within the piece. To follow She is Risen, Garner released a continuation showcase entitled, The Remains, which was located at JTT in the winter of 2020. The pieces entitled, \\"After Her Womb,\\" \\"After Her Flag,\\" and \\"After Her Tomb,\\" are all related to the pieces in the She is Risen collection regarding Betsey and Anarcha, who were women that were unjustly experimented on while enslaved. The piece, \\"After Her Harvest,\\" refers to the piece, \\"Henrietta: After the Harvest,\\" about Henrietta Lacks and the cancer cells that were taken from her without her consent. All four of these pieces showcase the flesh from the experimentation of black women.  Tattoos  In winter of 2018, Garner held a pop-up tattoo parlor every Friday and Saturday through March 3, 2018 entitled, Invisible Man Tattoo. It was located in Recess in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. There, she allowed people to either pick from her designated designs, or create their own. These created tattoos were anywhere from cotton flowers to Martin Luther King Jr. and black panther heads. Additionally, anyone who identified as a brown or black people of color would receive a free tattoo from a selected list. The purpose of this pop-up tattoo parlor was to address the tattoo culture, which tended to eliminate black history, and to create a space in which people of color would feel welcome.  Podcast  #trashDAY is a podcast run by Garner and Kenya (Robinson). Their podcast offers a wide range of ideas, anywhere from strategies to help oneself, to intensive critique. The podcast appears on Clocktower Radio and the purpose of this podcast is to be a starting point for social commentary displayed in a bit of mockery or sarcasm.

Hundreds originated in the late Saxon period as a subdivision of a county and lasted as administrative divisions until the 19th century. Langley and Swinehead was divided into two divisions - Upper and Lower - the Upper division comprised the four ancient parishes of Bitton, Doynton, Frampton-Cotterell and Winterbourne and part of the parish of Alveston. The Lower division comprised the three ancient parishes of Littleton-upon-Severn, Olveston and Rockhampton, the remainder of Alveston and part of the parish of Almondsbury.The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland , 1868, via GENUKI At the time of the Domesday Book Langley and Swineshead were listed as two separate hundreds; Langley also included the parish of Thornbury - later a hundred of its own - and Swineshead included both the city of Bristol and what later became the Barton Regis Hundred. Langley Hundred, on the west, comprised places within seven parishes: * Alveston * Frampton Cotterell * Littleton-upon-Severn * Olveston * Rockhampton * Thornbury * Almondsbury - Gaunts Earthcott and Tockington Swineshead, on the east, comprised places within Bristol (Bristol and Blacksworth), the later Barton Regis Hundred (Barton, Clifton, Mangotsfield and Ridgeway) and four other parishes: * Bitton - Bitton, Oldland and Hanham * Winterbourne - Winterbourne, Hambrook and Sturden * Stoke Gifford (later in Henbury Hundred) * Wapley (later in Grumbold's Ash Hundred) Doynton was part of Pucklechurch Hundred at the time of the Domesday book. The name Langley is derived from lang lēah (long clearing), the place believed to be in Alveston parish where the hundred court met. 'Swineshead' came from swīn hēafod (pigs hill), a place near Swineford, Bitton parish where that hundred court met. It's unclear when the hundreds of Langley and Swineshead were combined: the hundreds were still listed separately in 1395 and the combined hundred was reported from, at the latest, 1602.

Hodges was born on August 7, 1934, and was raised in Michigan. He was educated at Michigan State University, obtaining first a BSc then an MSc. He obtained a PhD from Cornell University in 1961. Interested in moths from a young age, he obtained a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship and began researching the Gelechiidae. He broke off from that work to take up a post at the Systematic Entomology Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, in the National Museum of Natural History. He eventually left that role to return to work on gelechioid moths. He was the author of three volumes of The Moths of America North of Mexico, on the Oecophoridae, Cosmopterigidae, and Gelechiidae. He served as managing director of the series' publisher, the Wedge Entomological Research Foundation and as its editor-in-chief. He introduced the MONA numbering scheme for North American moths in 1983 in the publication Check List of the Lepidoptera of America North of Mexico, which he edited. A MONA number is also referred to as a \\"Hodges number\\". He was elected to the Washington Biologists' Field Club in 1963 and served as its president from 1976 to 1979.

Upon retirement in January 1997 he and his wife Elaine moved to Eugene, Oregon. He died at home in Eugene, on December 10, 2017.  Recognition  Hodges was granted the Thomas Say Award by the Entomological Society of America for his work on Moths of North America in 1990, and the Lepidopterists' Society's Karl Jordan Medal for his gelechioid research in 1997. He was elected an honorary member of the Entomological Society of Washington in 1999. Chionodes hodgesorum was named in honor of Hodges and his wife, to coincide with his 80th birthday.

He is the Democratic nominee for New York's 25th State Senate district general election to be held on November 3, 2020. Early life and education Brisport was raised in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, to a Caribbean immigrant father and a second-generation Brooklynite mother. He attended New York University Tisch School of the Arts and the Yale School of Drama. Career Brisport is a math teacher, who has taught at Medgar Evers College Preparatory School. Political campaigns In 2017, Brisport ran against incumbent Laurie Cumbo for the 35th District city council seat in New York City. In a rare Green Party primary, Brisport defeated opponent Scott Hutchinson 32 votes to 4. Brisport was partially inspired by Bernie Sanders to run for office. He was endorsed by Sanders' Our Revolution and New York Communities for Change, as well as the New York Chapter of DSA in the race. He lost the election, but gained 29% of the vote. Brisport's run earned more independent votes in any council race since 2003. alt=A short- haired Black man wearing a white T-shirt and a surgical mask speaks into a black megaphone. In 2019, Brisport announced a run for the New York State Senate 25th District, held by Democrat Velmanette Montgomery. On September 29, 2019, Brisport's run for State Senate was officially endorsed by the DSA. On election night of the Democratic primary on June 23, 2020, Brisport led the race with 52.25% of the vote against sitting Assemblywoman Tremaine Wright and former Velmanette Montgomery staffer Jason Salmon. However, absentee ballots were more significant than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and on election night there were still 26,000 absentee ballots to be counted. Brisport declared victory on July 23, once the absentee ballots had been counted and his lead over Wright had been extended to 10,000 votes. Given the overwhelmingly Democratic supermajority in New York’s 25th State Senate district, Brisport is considered the presumptive Senator-elect. Political positions Brisport is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Brisport's support for affordable housing includes not only stopping the private development of the Bedford Union Armory in Crown Heights, but to other perennial measures, such as a vacancy tax and a pied-à-terre tax, as well as housing plans that are 100% affordable, rather than a mix of market price or luxury condominiums.

(c. 1667–1734), was an independent theologian. Life Thomas Ridgley was born in London about 1667. He was educated for the ministry in Wiltshire, presumably under John Davison at Trowbridge. In 1695 he was chosen assistant to Thomas Gouge, pastor of the independent church at Three Cranes, Fruiterers' Alley, Thames Street, London. On Gouge's death he succeeded to the pastorate, which he held till his own death, being assisted by John Hurrion and (from 1732) by Samuel Parsons. On the death of Isaac Chauncy in 1712 he was elected divinity tutor to the Fund Academy in Tenter Alley, Moorfields, established by the London congregational fund board in 1696. His coadjutor in classics and science was John Eames. Ridgley had abundance of theological learning, and was a good instructor. His position as a teacher was that of a bulwark of dissenting orthodoxy against the prevalent tendencies to Arian and Arminian laxity. This duty he discharged with great ability and considerable individuality of treatment. Yet his scheme of the Trinity, denuded of the generation of the Son and the procession of the Spirit, is essentially Sabellian, and in easing the difficulties of Calvinism he follows the Socinians in limiting the penalties of Adam's sin to death and temporal discomfort. In 1719 he took the side of subscription in the Salters' Hall debates, thus ranging himself with the older presbyterians; while Hunt, Lowman, Lardner, and Jennings, his juniors among the learned independents, were for non-subscription. His lectures expository of the larger catechism of the Westminster divines constitute his ‘Body of Divinity,’ which, issued by subscription in 1731, became a textbook of moderate Calvinism, and gained him the diploma of D.D. from Aberdeen. Ridgley died on 27 March 1734, aged 66, and was buried in Bunhill Fields. His portrait by Bartholomew Dandridge has been engraved by Vandergucht. Publications He published, besides single sermons, including funeral sermons for Gertrude Clarkson (1701), Elizabeth Bankes (1711), Nathan Hall (1719), Thomas Tingey (1729), John Hurrion (1732), and John Sladen (1733, two editions same year): * The Unreasonableness of the Charge of Creed-making, (1719), (related to the Salters' Hall controversy), * An Essay Concerning Truth and Charity, (1721), (related to the Salters' Hall controversy), * The Doctrine of Original Sin, (1725); two editions same year (two lectures at Pinners' Hall, with postscript) * A Body of Divinity, (1731) See also *Thomas Bradbury ;Attribution External links * Works of Ridgley at the Post-Reformation Digital Library Category:1734 deaths Category:English religious writers Category:Dissenting academy tutors Category:17th-century English clergy Category:18th-century English clergy Category:Burials at Bunhill Fields ","title":"Thomas Ridgley"},{"id":"56156514","text":"Blend is a Swedish brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by \\"Svenska Tobaks AB\\".

In 2015, Zetland initiated a relaunch with a crowd-funding campaign which raised over 530,000 kroner (kr.), and additional investments of 8 million kr. The relaunch occurred in March 2016, with Zetland offering daily news articles. In 2016, revenue was 6.2 million kr. In 2018 Zetland is to receive 1.8 million kr. for editorial production services from the Danish cultural board '. Since the relaunch, notable pieces have included conversations with Justice Minister Søren Pind and British sociologist Anthony Giddens. In 2017 Zetland won a trio of awards from the Society for News Design Scandinavias, including gold and \\"Best of Show\\" in the digital news category for front page, and silver in the website category. Zetland has been offering its stories in audio format as well as text, and that has rapidly become the most popular aspect of the site, with 60% of members now consuming their content in audio. Korsgaard attributes the growth of the title to its focus on a membership model as a community, and a constrained number of stories per day, making the site \\"finish-able\\" each day.

Geography  Aerial view (1955) Altreu lies 429 m above sea level, 7 km west-southwest of the canton's capital Solothurn. The village stands along the north bank of the Aare and at the meeting point of the two streams Haagbach and Selzacherbach, shortly before they flow into the Aare. The village is located in a nearly 3 km-wide lowland of the Aare in the west of Solothurn's part of the Swiss Plateau.  Recreation  Altreu is a stop for hikers and bicyclists along the meandering course of the Aare. Altreu is known internationally for its white stork colony, which was established by conservationist Max Blösch in 1948; the 15 km2 'Witi' reserve serves as a hunting ground and resting place for the storks in the marshlands of the Aare. In 2008, Altreu was recognized as a European stork village by the EuroNatur foundation.  Transportation  The village lies away from major thoroughfares but is easy to reach from nearby Selzach. Altreu is connected by bus to Grenchen's train station. The Selzach train station on the Solothurn- Biel line is approximately 1 km from the village center. The Leuzigen-Altreu ferry carries passengers across the Aare, and Altreu is also a stop for the passenger ship between Biel and Solothurn.  History  A Roman fort once stood in the area of Altreu, along with a bridge which connected the Roman roads north of the Aare with the main road to the south between Aventicum and Salodurum (Solothurn). The first recorded mention of the town appeared in 1280 as Altrua; from 1330 the name appears as Altrüwe. At around 1260, the Neuenburg-Strassberg noble family established the medieval town of Altreu, which was fortified with walls, trenches, and a castle; a wooden bridge over the Aare was also constructed at that time. The region north of the Aare which separated from the Strassberg Herrschaft in 1309 was named after Altreu; this area included the municipalities of Selzach and Bettlach, as well as the western part of Lommiswil. In 1340 Altreu was purchased by the Neuenburg-Nidau family. The invading Gugler mercenary army destroyed the town and bridge in 1375, and the town was not rebuilt afterwards because erosion and changes in the Aare's flow were threatening the town more and more. Solothurner burgher Rudolf Sefrid von Erlach purchased the area in 1377 and gave it to the city of Solothurn in 1389, where it was merged into the Lebern district. A hamlet grew in the location of the former town which, though part of the Selzach municipality, possessed a degree of autonomy until 1831 with its own Ammann (bailiff), common land, and Weibel (a type of Swiss official with various administrative and ceremonial duties).

Líber Arce was a student at the Dental Prosthetics School of the University of the Republic's Faculty of Dentistry, and worked at a street market with his parents. He was also a militant of the Dentistry Student Center, the (FEUU), and the Union of Communist Youth (UJC) from the age of 19, with whom he demonstrated for democracy, social justice, and solidarity with peoples fighting for liberation. Historical context On 13 June 1968, had been decreed by the government, a state of emergency that would be maintained for months. In the early hours of 9 August, Interior Minister Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga – under the orders of Jorge Pacheco Areco – ordered searches of the University of the Republic, the Faculties of Agronomy, Architecture, Psychology, Medicine, and the National School of Fine Arts, with the justification that those places contained weapons and pamphlets violating the security measures then in force. When the students arrived to class they found the disorder and destruction caused by the raids. The Central Board of the University of the Republic denounced all the damage caused, the theft of teaching material, documentation, and all the files with the students' personal data. Student outrage broke out in the form of daily clashes as a consequence of the violation of . The demonstrations were made in inorganic form, in different parts of the city, causing a great strain on the police. Mortal wounding At noon on 12 August 1968, a group of dental, medical, nursing, and veterinary students set out from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, located on the street then called Larrañaga, on the way to Rivera Avenue. This \\"lightning demonstration\\" was intercepted by a police vehicle with an officer and three agents who were present. Officer Enrique Tegiachi fired on the group. There Líber Arce was wounded in the left groin, causing a hemorrhage. The policemen pointed their revolvers at the students and demanded the presentation of their identity documents. In this way they delayed the transfer of Líber Arce to a health center. Finally, the students managed to reach the Hospital de Clínicas, where Líber Arce was diagnosed with a cut in the left femoral artery at the confluence of the superficial and deep femoral artery in the inguinal region. The loss of blood caused anemia, hypovolemia, and successive cardiac arrests throughout the next day. In spite of everything, the doctors managed to stop the hemorrhage and a vascular graft was performed to repair the artery sectioned by the shot. However, all efforts were in vain. Líber Arce died on 14 August. Funeral March to the atrium of the University of the Republic, for the viewing of Líber Arce A viewing was held for Líber Arce in the atrium of the University of the Republic. A crowd accompanied his body to the Cementerio del Buceo, transforming the event into a popular demonstration against government policy. It is estimated that more than a quarter of a million people attended the funeral.

It was a portfolio of documentation related to a pupil's academic and non-academic achievements, typically including GCSE certificates, certificates from extracurricular activities, school reports and anything else of relevance, presented in an official-looking folder. Adopted by the Department for Education in 1991 and rolled out in 1993, the Record was intended to allow pupils to demonstrate skills and achievements beyond their exam results, potentially of use for further education and higher education admissions and to employers. It was hoped that pupils would continue to add to their Records after leaving school. In practice, the National Record of Achievement failed to meet these aspirations. In the mid-1990s it was common to use them for further education admissions, for instance to sixth form college, but university admissions tutors never found them relevant. Neither further nor higher education institutions encouraged students to continue to update them. Only a small number of employers (typically those used to recruiting large numbers of school-leavers) made use of them alongside the traditional application form, and found them of limited use. In 1996, a review of 16-19 qualifications by Ronald Dearing recommended the winding up of the National Record of Achievement scheme. By the mid-2000s they had become scarce.

Biography  Jussuf Abbo was born in Safed, Ottoman Palestine to a large Jewish family of farmworkers. He won a scholarship to attend the Alliance Israelite Universelle school in Jerusalem. As a young man he was employed as a stonemason by German architect Otto Hoffmann in Jerusalem, who, recognizing his talent, arranged for him to study at the Berlin University of the Arts where he studied drawing, painting and sculpture from 1913. By 1919 he had a master studio at the Academy of Arts, Berlin and had become a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund (Association of German Artists), whose 25th annual exhibition (1929 in Cologne's \\"Staatenhaus\\") featured a bronze female torso and a lead casting by him.Catalogue Deutscher Künstlerbund Köln 1929.

First volume (A-D)], E. A. Seemann, Leipzig 1999 (study edition). . (page 3) In the 1920s, Abbo belonged to the circle of friends of Else Lasker-Schüler, whom he portrayed several times and who in turn wrote a poem about him.Else Lasker-Schüler: Jussuff Abbu (poem), in Berliner Börsen-Courier, July 15, 1923. He worked as a sculptor and printmaker and fired his ceramic works in the workshops of fellow Berlin artists Otto Douglas Douglas-HillGisela Reineking von Bock: Meister der deutschen Keramik, 1900 bis 1950 [Masters of German ceramics, 1900 to 1950], Kunstgewerbemuseum, 1978, p.29 and Jan Bontjes van BeekIn biography of Jan Bontjes van Beek by Heinz-Joachim Theis (in German)..

Read online.. He then fled from Nazi Germany to England with his wife Ruth Schulz. He had to leave his work behind and was thus prevented from presenting it in exhibitions in London and gaining a foothold in his new country.

Much of the work removed was later destroyed by the Nazi regime. In the same year, he won an important commission to sculpt a portrait bust of the British politician George Lansbury.Bust of George Lansbury by Jussuf Abbo, 1937 , at People's History Museum, 2016 In 1939, he cast the Lansbury bust in Paris, where he also met the French sculptor Charles Despiau. During the war, he was unable to work in his studio in London and made a living with odd jobs and by selling antiques. At the end of the war in 1945, he was not able to keep his studio and as a result destroyed most of the works created in England because of a lack of storage space and out of frustration and disappointment. Financial hardship, forced emigration, war and difficult working conditions ended up adversely affecting Abbo's physical and mental health. He died in a London hospital on 29 August 1953 following a lengthy illness. Work The distinctive feature of Abbo's sculpture work is a subtle sensitivity to the physiognomy and emotional state of his subjectsWächter, Anja / Mieves, Esther: New /old homeland: R/Emigration of artists after 1945, Kunsthaus Dahlem, 2017, p.164, an understated focus on expression, posture and attitude.

Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Ilyushin Il-18B registered CCCP-75685 to the Kazakh Civil Aviation Directorate of Aeroflot. The aircraft had sustained 6802 flight hours.  Crew  Eight crew members were aboard the flight. The cockpit crew consisted of: * Captain Konstantin Sergeevich Artamonov * Check captain and Head of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Directorate Rishat Nurmukhametovich Azakov * Co-pilot Nikolai Aleksandrovich Slamikhin * Flight engineer Anatoliy Galiyevich Shakirov * Navigator Vladimir Vasiliyevich Pristavka * Radio operator Nikolay Nikolayevich Safonov Flight attendants Stanislav Valentinovich Port and Augustina Yakovlevna Kuzmenykh worked in the cabin.  Synopsis  The flight was scheduled to depart from Domodedovo airport at 07:30 on January 4, but was delayed by necessary engine repairs. The flight did not depart from Domodedovo until 10:20 and arrived at Omsk airport at 15:52 Moscow time. The flight was supposed to depart from Omsk thereafter for a short flight to Alma-Ata. At the same time, head of the Kazakh aviation division R. Azakov had just returned from investigating a Mil Mi-4 crash and inspected the undercarriage of the Il-18 before it was cleared for the next leg of the journey. The flight's destination was delayed for 2 hours 28 minutes because visibility at Alma-Ata airport was less than , which meant that the airport had to close for safety reasons. At 19:30 Moscow time the flight departed from Omsk en route to Alma- Ata and maintained a cruising altitude of . At 20:15 Moscow time the weather at Alma-Ata was reported to have a visibility of , wind was weak, and atmospheric pressure was 710.5 mmHg. At 20:32, a different Il-18, registered CCCP-75689, landed the runway with a 230° bearing after twice failing to land on the runway at a bearing of 50° and having to execute a go-around. After landing while taxiing at the airport the operations manager asked the Il-18 if it would be safe for another Il-18 to land in the same weather. The pilot responded by categorically denying that any Il-18 could safely land in the current conditions. The controller then to told Flight 20 to proceed to the alternate airport, Sary-Arka Airport; but five minutes later the operations manager reversed the previous instruction and told Flight 20 to start decreasing altitude to and then to to land at Alma-Ata. In violation of procedures the controller did not inform the flight of visibility conditions or the altitude of the lower cloud boundary. At an altitude of 3000 meters the flight contacted air traffic control and received permission to descend to an altitude of . The landing was to be carried out on a bearing of 230°. The controller did warn of the presence of fog at the airport, but said that it had subsided a bit and it probably he did not expect visibility to go below the minimum safe level. The crew began to execute the approach as planned, but by the fourth turn the aircraft was to the right of the center of the runway. When the flight was away from the runway, the controller instructed the flight to decrease altitude to and warned that visibility was starting to worsen. When the aircraft was from the end of the runway it entered the glidepath and continued decreasing altitude for the landing. The visibility at the airfield had reached , well below the minimum safe distance; the controller did not inform the flight or the operations manager of the situation. The current conditions required the flight to be switched to the alternate airport but it was not. The non-directional beacon lights pulsed, but the aircraft began to deviate to the left slightly. The controller notified the crew of the deviation and instructed them to correct course by 2° and follow the lights to approach the runway. The crew confirmed hearing what the controller said and stated that they saw the beacon lights. The controller then instructed the flight to change course by 3°; the aircraft went from being slightly to the left of the runway to slightly to the right. The controller advised the crew to abort the landing and do a go-around, but the crew ignored the instruction and continued with the landing. During the approach, check captain Azakov instructed the pilot-in-command Artamonov to conduct and instrument approach, while Azakov took on other landing duties. There was confusion among the crew at decision altitude (130 meters) because the controller told them to go- around due to visibility but both the navigator and inspector told the captain they saw the runway lights, leading the captain to continue the landing. Shortly thereafter the crew lost sight of the lights, but the captain was not aware that the rest of the crew lost sight of the lights; the captain then drew his attention away from his instruments to look for the lights, causing the aircraft to fly off course. When the controller commanded the flight to do a go-around, the inspector was looking for the lights while the pilot-in- command waited for him to instruct him to proceed with the go-around. Seconds before crashing the captain saw that the plane was about to crash and tried to avoid the collision with the ground, and only then did the Azakov command him to do a go-around. At 21:01 Moscow time the flight crashed to the right of the runway at a speed of . The landing gear was torn off and the right wings separated from the rest of the plane. The left wing and fuselage were broken into several pieces, and a fire ignited, partially burning the wreckage. The radio operator, two flight attendants and 61 of passengers (including six children) were killed in the accident. Seventeen of the survivors sustained injuries.  Conclusions  The causes of the accident were described as follows: # The air traffic controller dispatching the flight for landing in weather below minimum safe conditions and not immediately informing the crew of such conditions; # Crew error in executing the late missed approach and flying in unsafe weather. A secondary cause of the accident was the failure of METAR to provide weather reports at 20:00, 20:15 and 20:30 when the bad weather intensified, which would have helped assist the flight to determine if it should have continued with the approach. It was also noted that the head of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Directorate was not supposed to assist the crew on the flight, as he had already worked fifteen hours that day and did not have a medical certificate to fly.

Thompson, 403 U.S. 217 (1971), is a United States Supreme Court civil rights case which concerned the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.. Background The city of Jackson, Mississippi, closed all of its public swimming pools, as opposed to integrating them. Originally there were five public pools, but the city closed four of them, and surrendered its lease to the fifth pool to the lessor, the YMCA, which continued to operate the pool privately and on a segregated basis. Hazel Palmer, mother of a freedom rider who was arrested at the bus station, and other black citizens filed suit against the city under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection and under the Thirteenth Amendment, on the grounds that the city's actions created a \\"badge or incident\\" of slavery. The lower courts found no constitutional violation. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the case was argued by Paul A. Rosen and William Kunstler for the petitioners. With them on the briefs were Ernest Goodman and Arthur Kinoy. The case was argued for the respondents by William F. Goodman, Jr. Holding The Supreme Court held in its syllabus, \\"The closing of the pools to all persons did not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Negroes.\\" The court stated \\"there was no evidence that the city conspired with the YMCA that its pool be segregated.\\" The court further rejected the equal protection argument that the city's action \\"was motivated by a desire to avoid integration of the races\\" because \\"no case in this Court has held that a legislative act may violate equal protection solely because of the motivations of the men who voted for it.\\"Palmer, 403 U.S. at 224.

The venue is projected to open for the 2021–22 NHL season. The arena will serve as the home of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL) and will host around 150 major events annually. UBS holds the exclusive naming rights to the arena. History Lighthouse Project Construction on the Lighthouse Project was not planned to begin until at least mid-2009. Nassau County approved the project in 2006 on a 16–2 vote, and the draft environmental impact statement was completed after a state-mandated environmental review. The Lighthouse Project was then expected to go before the Town of Hempstead for approval on a change in land zoning. However, the approval was never granted. After the October 2009 deadline passed, the Long Island Press reported the Lighthouse Project's cancellation. On July 12, 2010, Town Supervisor Kate Murray (R-Hempstead) announced an “alternate zone” created for the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum property, downsizing the original Lighthouse Project to half its proposed size and making the project, according to then-Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano and the developers, \\"economically unviable for both the developer and owner of the site\\". From that point, the Lighthouse Project would no longer be pursued by then- Islanders owner Charles Wang, Mangano and the developers. Willets Point In May 2010, Jeff Wilpon, COO of the New York Mets of Major League Baseball, had discussions with Wang about constructing a new arena for the Islanders in the Willets Point neighborhood of Queens, adjacent to the Mets' ballpark, Citi Field. Wilpon also discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders. In June 2010, the website FanHouse reported that Jeff and Fred Wilpon, the owner of the Mets, began working with real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (who is also working on the renovation of Madison Square Garden) on a feasibility study of a new Islanders arena in Queens. However, a source from Newsday indicated that the FanHouse report was not true. There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders and move them to Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Voter referendum On May 11, 2011, the Islanders and Nassau County executives announced that county residents would vote on a referendum for approval of a $400 million public bond issue for a new plan to replace the Coliseum. The plan, including the construction of a new $350 million arena as well as a $50 million minor league baseball ballpark nearby, was presented by Wang as a last-ditch effort to keep the Islanders in Nassau County. However, voters in Nassau County rejected a proposal by a 57% to 43% margin on August 1, 2011. Barclays Center On October 24, 2012, the Islanders announced the team would move to Barclays Center in Brooklyn after their lease expired at the end of the 2014–15 season. Since the Islanders moved to Barclays Center, there have been numerous complaints about obstructed-view seats. The arena was built primarily for basketball, and has a hockey configuration in which the scoreboard is off-centered above the blue line, and an asymmetrical seating configuration with only three rows of permanent seating on the northwest end of the arena. As a result, many seats are obstructed, with several hundred not sold at all. Business Insider has called sections 201 to 204 and 228 to 231 \\"the worst seat in American professional sports\\". In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Barclays Center CEO Brett Yormark acknowledged the issue, but insisted nothing can be done: \\"There's really nothing we’re going to do from a capital improvement standpoint. You can watch the game on your mobile device. The game is on the scoreboard.\\" There have been numerous complaints about the quality of the ice during hockey games. The arena uses PVC piping instead of steel piping under the ice surface, making it much harder to maintain NHL standards and temperature. Planning and design On December 20, 2017, it was announced that the Islanders won a bid to build a new 19,000-seat arena at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York in Nassau County, beating out a competing proposal by New York City FC of Major League Soccer for their soccer-specific stadium project. New York Arena Partners, a combination of the Islanders, Oak View Group, and Sterling Equities, proposed to build a mixed-use entertainment complex that will include an approximately , 19,000-seat multi-use arena that will be home to the New York Islanders; a retail, dining, and entertainment village; a 250-room hotel; and of offices and parking. In July 2019, the plan was adopted by the Empire State Development Corporation board. The plan also includes a new Elmont station on the LIRR, in addition to the hotel, arena, and retail village. UBS Arena is poised to become a global landmark entertainment and sports destination. The venue is designed with artists in mind to ensure the performers and crew have efficient and effortless access. In partnership with Oak View Group, Live Nation and The Azoff Company, the UBS Arena offers a bespoke, back-of-house campus and efficient load in/load out services. A state of the art sound system, the largest scoreboard in New York, theatrical lightning, ice video projections, POS solutions, 5G cellular and fast Wi-Fi service aim to create one of the best fan experiences. In addition, UBS Arena will offer high-end amenities and customer service, through VIP suites and clubs that merge boutique hospitality with live entertainment. Clubs and suites will have a timeless design inspired by classic, well-known New York establishments and will offer premier views of the bowl. The arena also includes outdoor terraces open to all guests, world-class acoustics and theater-inspired game presentation. UBS Arena’s exterior and interior will pay homage to iconic New York landmarks, including Grand Central Terminal, Prospect Park Boathouse and the Park Avenue Armory. Completing UBS Arena, Belmont Park’s campus will comprise 315,000 sq ft of luxury retail and will include a 4-star boutique hotel with up to 250 rooms. To ensure the health and safety of patrons and staff, the venue is being designed with advanced safety measures in mind. Construction On September 23, 2019, the groundbreaking was held for the arena featuring New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, and officials, alumni and current players from the Islanders. On March 27, 2020, construction was paused due to an order from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to stop all non-essential construction work until April 21 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 16, 2020, it was announced that the pause was extended to May 15, 2020. On May 9, 2020, it was announced that the pause was further extended to May 23, 2020. On May 27, 2020, construction resumed as part of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s phased regional reopening plan for New York State. Team officials said that they expect construction to finish in time for the Islanders to begin play there in October 2021, despite the 2 month pause. On July 22, 2020, the New York Islanders announced that the arena will be named UBS Arena, after the Swiss Bank UBS. The deal is reportedly worth $350 million over 20 years.  Social and economic footprint  The $1.5 billion project and surrounding redevelopment expected to generate approximately $25 billion in economic activity, including major infrastructure improvements, 10,000 construction jobs, and 3,000 permanent jobs of which 30% are to be set aside for local residents. The $1.5 billion private investment into the arena and the overall surrounding campus will provide a significant boost, of approximately $25 billion, to the regional economy at a time when economic activity has slowed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will also inject much needed stimulus into the New York economy and the local community, with the goal of filling 30% of UBS Arena’s permanent jobs with workers who live in the surrounding area. Thirty percent of contracting dollars for construction will also be earmarked for state-certified minority and female-owned businesses, and 6% will be earmarked for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. There also are plans for an additional $100 million investment in transit and infrastructure enhancements, including the first, newly constructed Long Island Rail Road station in almost 50 years. UBS Arena will also commit a significant philanthropic investment to drive economic redevelopment and strengthen the local community. The primary focus of these efforts will be on improving college and career readiness for local youth by providing programming related to post-secondary education and entrepreneurship, both of which are longtime cornerstones of UBS’s community impact efforts across the Americas region. The Arena is being built to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED v4) standards for Building Design and Construction. In an effort to build a greener future, UBS Arena is working with world-class sustainability experts to minimize the environmental impact of the venue and become a zero waste facility, utilizing renewable energy sources and reducing water and electricity consumption.

Returned Dani Sordo cleared the stage in fourth, followed by another experienced WRC 2 driver Jan Kopecký. Defending world champion Sébastien Ogier finished in seventh, ahead of Andreas Mikkelsen and Craig Breen by 0.1 and 0.2 second respectively. Two WRC 2 drivers, Umberto Scandola and Kajetan Kajetanowicz completed the top ten. Friday Five-time world champion Sébastien Ogier was the fastest man to finish the day other than the defending rally winner Ott Tänak, who set five out of six fastest stage times and built a 12.3-second lead over the Frenchman, while championship leader Thierry Neuville was another 15.1 seconds behind. Elfyn Evans climbed up three places in the afternoon loop and edged Jari-Matti Latvala by a second. Dani Sordo completed the day in sixth, only one-tenth of a second ahead of Esapekka Lappi, who failed to come to terms with dirt dragged onto the roads by the early starters. Craig Breen lost some time due to being caught in a heavy rain shower in the early stage in the eighth place, followed by Andreas Mikkelsen, who was struggling with his i20's handling and chose to change his driving style, in ninth, only one second behind. Teemu Suninen, driving a third Fiesta, in tenth. Lacking of power caused Mads Østberg to fail to find the pace like Finland, which made him cleared the day off the leaderboard in eleventh overall. Saturday The Ford Fiesta WRC of Elfyn Evans and Daniel Barritt crew during the rally. Saturday turned out to be a total disaster for Ford. First in the early stage, Elfyn Evans retired his Ford Fiesta from the day after sliding into a field, damaging the left front wheel in the process. Then in the afternoon loop, Second-place Sébastien Ogier suffered a puncture due to hitting a rock in the second pass through the marathon Panzerplatte military road test, dropping him five places to seventh overall, half a second behind Andreas Mikkelsen in front. This further extended Ott Tänak's lead to 43.7 seconds. This time over Dani Sordo, who edged Jari-Matti Latvala by just 0.8 second after a hot fight. Championship leader Thierry Neuville struggled for pace in his i20. He switched back to yesterday's differential and gearbox settings and found a comfortable rhythm. The Belgian eventually ended the day in fourth, eight seconds ahead of Esapekka Lappi. Teemu Suninen climbed up to eighth after Craig Breen crashed in the final stage and damaged his Citroën C3's rear left suspension and dropped down to tenth place, followed by Mads Østberg cleared the day in ninth after a trouble free day. Sunday The opening stage saw a dramatic start to final day of the event. Tenth-place Mads Østberg, who was third on road, went off into a field and forced to retire from the event. Dani Sordo and Jari-Matti Latvala should have a fierce competition for second place, but an accident damage, which is happened on the Spaniard，and a transmission failure, which is happened on the Finn, burned the battle to ash. The biggest beneficiary of the chaos is championship leader Thierry Neuville, who was pushed up to the second place after the two's retirement. The king of the event is obviously Ott Tänak, who led the entire rally but one stage. The Estonian took his first back-to-back victory in his career and now eats the gap to top to thirty-six points in the drivers' championships. Teammate Esapekka Lappi finished third, 21.7 seconds behind Thierry Neuville. With a 1-3 finish, Toyota overtook Ford to second in the manufacturers' championships, only thirteen points behind Hyundai. Although defending world champion Sébastien Ogier won the Power Stage, the outcome of fourth place finish still failed to narrow the gap to championship leader Thierry Neuville -- it is up to twenty-three points after the event. Teammate Teemu Suninen completed the rally with a fifth-place finish after a consistent weekend, followed by Andreas Mikkelsen in sixth. Craig Breen finished in seventh, while localman Marijan Griebel finished in eighth. WRC 2 leader Jan Kopecký and seventeen-year-old Kalle Rovanperä completed the leaderboard.

The Clark native was expected to be one of two coaches to be let go after Greg Schiano hired former Pittsburgh assistants Jeff Hafley and Brian Angelichio without formally releasing two current staffers.\\"  Playing career  Pinkham played football at Arthur L. Johnson High School. In college, he played for the Allegheny Gators from 1971 to 1974 on defense and special teams. As a defender, he posted 14 career interceptions (a second all-time in program history), including a PAC-leading six picks as a freshman in 1971. Pinkham averaged 22.9 yards per kick return, scoring two touchdowns over his career, and 13.8 yards per return with three touchdowns on punt returns. His two punt return touchdown in a single season ties him for the most in Allegheny history. His 81-yard punt return for a touchdown in a 1971 win over Case still stands as the third-longest in program history, while his 91-yard kick return score in 1974 is good for sixth-longest in team history. As a senior in 1974, he earned second team Associated Press (AP) All-America honors after tallying two interceptions and 31 tackles, while ranking in the top-10 in the NCAA in both kick return (25.2) and punt return (12.8) average. That season, he helped spearhead a Gator unit that ranked eighth nationally in total defense (181.4 yards/game), as the Gators finished 7-1 overall and captured the PAC title. For his career, Pinkham was a four-time All-PAC selection, two-time All- Pennsylvania selection, and two-time Pittsburgh Press All-District pick. He was inducted into the Allegheny Hall of Fame in 1988.  Coaching career   1975 to 2007  Ed Pinkham has been coaching for over 40 years, and has over 30 years of experience at the defensive coordinator position. In 1989, he became a secondary coach at the University of Minnesota. He was the secondary coach and defensive coordinator over a 12-year stint at the University of New Hampshire. Pinkham was defensive coordinator and associate head coach at the College of the Holy Cross for four seasons. At Minnesota, for the first two seasons he coached the outside linebackers, before moving over to the secondary. Pinkham led the defense at Colgate from 1996 through 2008. During his tenure at Colgate, the Raiders captured five Patriot League titles and earned five trips to the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision playoffs. The defensive unit led the Patriot League in total defense in 1999, 2003, 2004 and 2006, and three times paced the league in rushing defense.  2008 to 2012  Pinkham's return to the FCS level saw his defensive unit rate third nationally against the pass as Elon allowed an average of just 153.55 yards per game through the air. The unit also rated in the top 40 nationally in total defense. The Phoenix defense amassed 17 sacks, besting its total from the previous season by four. He served in the same capacity at Rutgers in 2009-10. In his first season as co-defensive coordinator, Pinkham helped the Rutgers defense reach great heights as the Scarlet Knights ranked in the top-20 in five categories, including leading the nation in tackles for loss and ranking second in turnover margin. Rutgers was 15th in the country in rushing defense, 16th in scoring defense and 18th in total defense.  2013 to 2017  When Pinkham coached at WMU, the team had the third-ranked scoring defense in the MAC at 24.9 points per game and second in total defense at 371.2 yards per game. They ranked 15th nationally in scoring defense (19.8 points per game), 26th in total defense (353.6 yards per game) and tied for first in turnover margin (plus-18), and helped lead the team to a 13-0 season.  2017 to 2018  Pinkham begin coaching at UMass in 2017 as their new defensive coordinator. The team went 4-8 in 2017, their best record in five years. Pinkham has received good reviews both from his players and outside observers for helping to turn the Minutemen around. His time at UMass saw the program record its most wins in back-to-back seasons in its seven-year history as an FBS member, while also collecting its first win over a team from one of the power-five conferences.  2019 to present  Pinkham entered his first season as the Red Wolves’ interior defensive line coach in 2019.

It follows the adventures of a teenage girl who is transported to a fantasy world, where she becomes a monster hunter. Synopsis Snarlbear follows a teenage grocery store employee named Daisy who is transported to another world, the Rainbow Dimension. After fighting and killing a bear monster, she is dubbed \\"Snarlbear\\" and becomes a professional monster hunter. She is joined by the elf Flint, who appoints himself her agent and manager. The two become involved in a conflict between the exiled unicorn prince Narcisso and his usurper sister Cassiopeia. Meanwhile, Snarl finds herself becoming absorbed in violence. Development Riess started Snarlbear with the intention of it being a relatively short project in order to produce a complete story and improve her art skills. She created the setting of the Rainbow Dimension in order to practice coloring. According to Riess, she became more serious about the comic after joining Hiveworks in 2015. When beginning the comic, Riess made a rough outline of each chapter, which was deliberately flexible to allow for later changes. Each chapter was scripted and thumbnailed before the process of page-drawing began. Riess began developing Space Battle Lunchtime while working on Snarlbear. Reception io9 and ComicsBeat remarked on the comic's bright yet sinister setting. ComicsBeat noted the expressionist use of color in emphasizing mood and action, and praised the monster designs.

It has a single bright green, tube-shaped leaf with a reddish base and up to twenty five green to yellowish-green flowers with red markings. The flowers are the smallest of any leek orchid found in Victoria. Description Prasophyllum suaveolens is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, bright green leaf which is long and wide near its reddish base. Between ten and twenty five strongly scented, green to yellowish-green flowers are loosely arranged along a flowering spike long, reaching to a height of . As with other leek orchids, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg- shaped, long, about wide, has reddish streaks and turns downward. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and free from each other or joined near their base. The petals are narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide and upswept with reddish line along the centre. The labellum is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and is green to pinkish. It curves sharply upwards near it middle and has a slightly crinkled edge. There is a fleshy, green callus in its centre and extending as far its tip. Flowering occurs in October and November. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum suaveolens was first formally described in 1994 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Lismore and the description was published in the journal Muelleria. The specific epithet (correctum) is a Latin word meaning \\"fragrant\\". Distribution and habitat The fragrant leek orchid grows in grassland and grassy woodland on basalt plains in inland areas, but once had a much wider distribution. Conservation In 2010, P. suaveolens was only known from eight population with a total of about 1500 plants but many populations occur on roadsides or in private property. Only two populations are conserved in reserves. The species is classed as Threatened under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and as Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the species are weed invasion, road or rail maintenance activities and inappropriate fire regimes.

It was first established in 1918 as Riverside Grammar School and was Duval County's fourth public school house. Public School Number Four was designated a historic landmark by the Jacksonville City Council in 2000. The abandoned school is also said to be haunted. History Public School Number Four traces its origins to Riverside Park School built in 1891. The school was a boxy wooden-frame later deemed a fire hazard and unstable. In 1915 Duval County passed a $1 million bond to build new brick school houses including one to replace Riverside Park School. Construction on a new school began in 1917, designed by architect Rutledge Holmes, and was completed in 1918 as Riverside Grammar School. It was Duval County's fourth public school house and inscribed on the building is Public School Number Four to reflect this. The name changed to Annie Lytle Public School around 1950 after the principal of Riverside Park School Annie Lytle Housh. Most of the school was constructed with poured concrete and was designed to withstand anything. The school originally overlooked Riverside Park until the construction of Interstate 95 and Interstate 10 isolated the school. In 1960 Annie Lytle was permanently closed to the public and was used for office space and storage for ten years. The building was sold in 1980 for $168,000 to the Ida Stevens Foundation in hopes of renovating it for senior citizen apartments. Due to federal funding programs the building was not renovated. The building has been vacant for over 20 years falling into disrepair. A fire erupted at the vacant building in 1995 leading to the auditorium roof to cave in. In 1999 Foundation Holding Incorporated purchased the property to convert it into condominiums but public outcry resulted in the school becoming a designated historic landmark in 2000. Tarpon IV LLC purchased the building in 2011 for an $86,600 tax deed. Myths and legends Building interior in 2013 The abandoned school has attracted numerous vandals, homeless, and drug addicts in addition to graffiti artists covering much of the interior. The vandalism and ruins of the school led to various local myths being developed such as a janitor who tortured students in the boiler room despite a lack of evidence. Local myths have also led to the school being dubbed The Devil's School. The most common myth is that the school is said to be haunted. Other myths include a cannibalistic principal and janitor. The principal myth can be attributed one principal's reputation as a strict disciplinarian. However, there is not any proof of such claims. There is no known source for the Legend of the janitor. However both are said to have taken victims to the boiler room. Other legends suggest the school was built on an old Timaquan burial ground. This, however, has been proven false. Not only were no bodies found in the digging of the basement, but considering the high water table of the area and how the legend does not align with the death rituals and traditions of any local tribes, it is not likely or believable. Another legend suggests a portal to hell in the basement and another behind the stage. Some cite the various fires, such as the most recent one that took out most of the remaining wood in the auditorium. The structure itself remained, as it is one of 12 \\"fireproof\\" schools built in response to the great fire of Jacksonville that took place in 1901. Other myths suggest that the suspected paranormal activity can be attributed to the \\"psychic dust\\", a sort of psychic imprint, that had been left as a result of years of energetic children. History suggests the myths have little truth to them, if any.

Gustaf Brahe was the son of Per Brahe the Elder and Beata Stenbock, and related to the royal family. He was the paternal grandson of Margareta Eriksdotter Vasa, making him the nephew of king Gustav I of Sweden and cousin of the kings Eric XIV of Sweden, John III of Sweden and Charles XI of Sweden, and a maternal nephew of queen Catherine Stenbock. He was the brother of Erik Brahe (1552–1614), Margareta Brahe (1559–1638), Magnus Brahe (1564–1633), Sigrid Brahe and Abraham Brahe (1569–1630). Gustaf Brahe is most known for his love affair with princess Anna Vasa of Sweden. They were raised together at court and was reportedly mutually in love with each other, and there where rumors that they met each other in secret in the home of Brahe's sister Ebba Sparre.Gustaf Brahe, urn:sbl:18043, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. BOËTHIUS.), hämtad 2017-12-29. In 1587, Gustaf Brahe followed Sigismund and Anna to Poland when Sigismund was elected king there. In 1589, he formally asked Sigismund for Anna's hand, and while he was not given a clear answer, he was not refused, which made him hope that he might be accepted.Gustaf Brahe, urn:sbl:18043, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. BOËTHIUS.), hämtad 2017-12-29. The attempts of marriage between Princess Anna and Gustaf Brahe was often mentioned but ultimately never brought to fruition, and both remained unmarried. The potential marriage between princess Anna and Gustaf Brahe was fiercely opposed by Duke Charles, who viewed it as a plot of Gustav Brahe to make princess Anna ruling queen regnant of Sweden while her only brother Sigismund was absent in Poland, and he therefore used their relationship in his libelous chronicle Karlskrönikan.Gustaf Brahe, urn:sbl:18043, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. BOËTHIUS.), hämtad 2017-12-29. In 1593, he was appointed the representative of Sigismund III Vasa in Sweden, and was to assist his brother Erik Brahe (1552–1614) as governor of Stockholm. He returned to Poland after a few months. A temporary estrangement occurred in the relationship between Anna and Brahe when she arranged for his sister Sigrid Brahe to marry for love against the wish of her family, but they soon reconciled.Gustaf Brahe, urn:sbl:18043, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. BOËTHIUS.), hämtad 2017-12-29. During the War against Sigismund, he was given a power of attorney by Sigismund to capture and imprison all the enemies of Sigismund he could manage. He left Sweden for Poland with Sigismund and Princess Anna after the Battle of Stångebro. Gustaf Brahe spent the rest of his life in exile in Poland, as did Anna, and made a military career in Poland to the rank of Field marshal. He died in Danzig in 1615.

It was less formally known as Montreal High School and from 1853 to 1870 was called the High School of McGill College, or the High School Division. Founded as a school for boys only, girls were first admitted in 1875, although to a separate division called the High School for Girls, and a new building shared by both was opened in 1878. In its last century the school took children from the first to the twelfth grades. In 1915, after occupying several different sites, the school moved into a new neoclassical building on University Street, near the campus of McGill University. Girls and boys were taught in separate wings of the building and were also apart for school sports, but came together for some activities. The two divisions were united into a single school in 1965. The school closed in June 1979, largely as the result of a decline in the English-speaking population.Gary Caldwell, Eric Waddell, The English of Québec: from majority to minority status (1982), p. 89 Soon after, the mostly French-speaking F.A.C.E. School moved into its empty premises,F.A.C.E. School at memorablemontreal.com, accessed 29 December 2017 to be joined by the MIND High School on the third floor. Origins James Ferrier The school was founded in 1843 by a group of Montreal professionals and merchants who saw the need for a Protestant secondary school which respected 19th-century ideas of education. It was modelled on the Royal High School, Edinburgh.Skakel, Alexander, in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, volume 7 (University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003), accessed 28 December 2017 Several of the founders, led by James Ferrier, with William Lunn, William Collis Meredith, David Torrance, and the Rev. Henry Esson,Elizabeth Ann Kerr McDougall, “ESSON, HENRY”, in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, volume 8 (University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003), accessed 28 December 2017 were of Presbyterian Scottish origins, and one of their purposes in establishing the school was to provide a solution to the growing influence of Anglicanism in education at the time. In short, they saw a need for a means of access to McGill College not controlled by supporters of the Church of England.Peter E. Rider, Heather McNabb, Kingdom of the Mind: How the Scots Helped Make Canada (McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP, 5 Apr 2006), p. 273 In August 1843, The Gentleman's Magazine reported, under 'Civil Preferments', \\"Rev. G. F. Simpson to be Rector of the Public College of Canada, about to be established at Montreal\\", suggesting that the name of the school still remained to be decided.Gentleman's Magazine dated August 1843, vol. 55 (1843), p. 198 The school was first organized as a private institution, under a Board of Directors.Report by Montreal Protestant Board of School Commissioners, 1910, p. 12 History The school's first Principal, the Rev. George Foster Simpson, M.A., was a young Englishman, a graduate and former scholar of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, born in 1811.John Archibald Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses 1752–1900, vol. V (1953), p. 515 He opened the school in November 1843 at Bingham House, which had been leased by the directors of the school, and within a few months 167 boys had been enrolled. The end-of-year ceremony in the summer of 1844, presided over by Peter McGill, with Lord Metcalfe to present the prizes, was held in the large hall that had been the ballroom of Bingham House.Edgar Allen Collard, Donegana's and the Charity Ball in Montreal Gazette(1972), accessed 1 January 2018 The boys at the school in its early days included Thomas White, George Holt Henshaw, George Washington Stephens, Andrew Gault, later called the Cotton King of Canada, and Charles Hamilton, first Archbishop of Ottawa. In 1846 the school moved into a new purpose-built building on La Gauchetière Street. The same year, on the death of the elderly Alexander Skakel, Master of the Royal Grammar School of Montreal, for many years the city's leading secondary school, the high school's board petitioned successfully for Skakel's salary to be transferred to it, and thus absorbed the Royal Grammar School.Guide to the Archives, vol. 2 at archives.mcgill.ca, accessed 28 December 2017 Newton Bosworth, describing the school in a guide to Montreal of 1846, reported that it had accommodation for between three and four hundred pupils, that the Rector had several able assistants, and that the fees were £10 a year \\"in the higher branches\\" and £6 a year in \\"the preparatory branches\\". On 28 July 1847 a Provincial Statute was enacted which allocated the revenues from the Estates of the Late Order of Jesuits to educational institutions around Quebec, and the first item listed in the schedule was \\"For the Salary and Allowance for House Rent, heretofore paid to the Master of the Grammar School at Montreal, to be allowed to the Directors of the High School at Montreal, in consideration of their educating twenty free scholars of the poorer classes ... £282-4s-6d\\".The Provincial Statutes of Canada: anno undecimo et duodecimo Victoriae Reginae (Montreal: Stewart Derbishire and George Desbarats, 1848), pp. 1483, 1484 Shortly afterwards the directors received £98-3s-6d as the balance of the grant for the year 1846, and also £141-2s-3d for the six months ended 30 June 1847.Journals of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Volume 8, Issue 1 (Legislative Assembly, 1849), Appendix A, No. 29 Grade 12 boys in class, 1945 In 1850, Foster resigned as Rector and returned to England, where he became headmaster of Lincoln Grammar School, but died suddenly in 1857. In 1853 control of the school was given to McGill, and it was renamed as the High School of McGill College. A McGill prospectus for 1863 states that \\"The High School Department offers a thorough English education, with the French and German languages, and the Classical and Mathematical training necessary for entering the College course.\\"Annual Announcement of the Faculty of Medicine of the McGill University, Montreal, for the 31st Session, 1863–64 (Montreal: J.

Becket, 1863), p. 9 In 1864, during the American Civil War, on hearing of the St Albans Raid from Montreal into the US by Confederate soldiers, the school organized a company called the Montreal High School Cadet Rifles. This continued to operate for some twenty years and was disappointed not to be mobilized at the time of the Fenian raids between 1866 and 1871.Montreal’s First Organized High School Militia Cadet Corps In 1864 dated August 18, 2015, at canadaatwarblog, accessed 5 January 2018Ernest J. Chambers, The Montreal Highland Cadets : being a record of the organization and development of a useful and interesting corps, with some notes on the cadet movements in Britain and Canada (Montreal: Desbarats & Co., 1901) In September 1870, control of the school was transferred again, this time to the Protestant Board of School Commissioners. Soon after that, J. W. Dawson, principal of McGill, began to press the Protestant Board to create a high school for girls, and in 1875 this came into being as a separate division, with its own \\"lady principal\\" and four other teachers, all trained at the McGill Normal School.Stanley Brice Frost, McGill University: For the Advancement of Learning, Volume I, 1801–1895, p. 256 This was made possible by a local school tax and was the spur for the planning of a new building, opened in 1878.Karen Stanworth, Visibly Canadian: Imaging Collective Identities in the Canadas, 1820–1910 (McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP, 2014), p. 289 To begin with, the girls' classes had been taught in private houses.Report by Montreal Protestant Board of School Commissioners, 1910, p. 54 The separate girls' school continued to exist in shared buildings until 1965, when for the first time the divisions for boys and girls were united under one principal.James Collins Miller, National Government and Education in Federated Democracies, Dominion of Canada (1940), p. 44 The boys' High School provided elementary as well as secondary education, with a junior division called the Preparatory High School. The girls' school did not at first include elementary classes, which came a few years later in the new building, and in 1878 the school population was 241 boys and 226 girls. Juniors at lunch in 1943, pictured by Conrad Poirier There was a bitter dispute in the 1880s when the Protestant School Board decided to stop the teaching of Latin in the first two forms and to limit Greek, Algebra, and Geometry to the final two forms. This was opposed by the elderly Rector, Dr Aspinall Howe, but supported by some parents and staff. On 28 November 1890 the dispute between those who believed in a classical education, including Latin and Greek, and those supporting a greater focus on sciences, culminated in the burning down of the school's building on Peel Street.J. I. Little, Jean Barman, “An educator of modern views” The (Auto)biography of Margaret Ross, 1862–1943 at queens.scholarsportal.info, accessed 28 December 2017 No cause was ever identified for the fire. Dr Howe, a fierce opponent of a move away from classical languages, quickly tendered his resignation, to take effect from the end of the school year. The successful applicant to replace him, Elson I. Rexford, was English Secretary of the Department of Public Instruction. A new school building was built on the site of the lost one and opened in the fall of 1892.Flower (1949), pp. 80–81 The school has been described as \\"the secondary school for the city's Protestant elite\\",Roderick MacLeod, Mary Anne Poutanen, “Proper Objects of this institution”: Working Families, children, and the British & Canadian school in Nineteenth-century Montreal, in Historical Studies in Education online at historicalstudiesineducation.ca, accessed 28 December 2017 but as reported by Margaret W. Westley, \\"By 1906, the Protestant Board of School Commissioners was operating fifteen publicly financed elementary schools and three secondary schools, some of which were located conveniently close to residents of the Square Mile. Most renowned was the High School of Montreal. One of the comments made most frequently by graduates about the High School of Montreal is that there one met and knew people from all walks of life and all backgrounds, something not true of the private schools.\\"Margaret W. Westley, Remembrance of Grandeur: The Anglo-Protestant Elite of Montreal, 1900–1950 (Editions Libre Expression, 1990), p. 64 However, in 1906 the Rector and Master, Wellington Dixon, who had succeeded Rexford in 1903, reported \\"The High School is not free. It is supported by fees paid by the pupils, a Government grant of $2,000, and by grants from the rate. In return for the Government grant of $2,000, thirty free tuitions are ordered by the Lieutenant-Governor, not on the results of examinations, but on certain conditions of good conduct, etc... The High School (Protestant) does not confine itself to advanced pupils. As before said, the Elementary Schools are free, but the High School takes young children in the Kindergarten and Elementary Departments if the parents are willing to pay the fees. The High School, except in the case of the scholarships already mentioned, is a school for the children of parents who are willing to pay fees. Out of the 1,200 pupils in attendance, 550 are in the High School proper, and 650 in the Kindergarten and Elementary Departments, all of the latter paying fees.Minutes and Votes and Proceedings of the Parliament, with Papers Presented to Both Houses, volume 1 (1906), p. 99 In 1906 the school had three separate courses of instruction for pupils, the first two being Classical and Scientific, which ran in parallel, and the other Commercial. The aim of the Classical and Scientific course was to prepare children for higher education and the professions. Believing in the principle of mens sana in corpore sano, the school aimed to develop both body and mind, and at its site in University Street had its own swimming pool, two gymnasiums, a shooting gallery, and games rooms, as well as a library, auditorium, and planetarium.Roderick MacLeod, Mary Anne Poutanen, Meeting of the People: School Boards and Protestant Communities in Quebec (McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP, 2004), pp. 287–290 During the First World War, 1,150 former pupils and staff of the High School went to fight in Europe, and 141 of them were killed. Their names are still recorded on a board in the foyer of the school building at 3449 University Street.Mike Boone, Remembrance Day is going high tech at Face in Montreal Gazette online dated 10 Nov 2010, accessed 29 December 2017 One former schoolboy, Dr F. A. C. Scrimger, was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1915 for outstanding bravery under enemy fire. Having shared buildings since the 1870s, the High School for Girls and the High School of Montreal at last became a single school in 1965.MacLeod & Poutanen (2004), p. 124 Nevertheless, in an autobiography Victor Malarek reports that in the mid-sixties the school remained segregated by sex.Victor Malarek, Hey, Malarek! (Toronto: Macmillan, 1984, ), pp. 144–148 In the late 1970s, with the school under the control of the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal, the decision was taken to close it with effect from June 1979, largely the result of a decline in the English-speaking population in the area. Subsequently, the mostly French- speaking F.A.C.E. School (Fine Arts Core Education) moved into its empty premises. Like the former High School, FACE is both a primary and secondary school. Buildings Bingham House, while being used as Donegana's Hotel after the high school's time there The school's first home was Bingham House, a former vice-regal residence at the corner of Notre Dame and St Denis Streets. In 1845 a new school building was begun in La Gauchetière Street, with an entrance on Belmont Street, later to become the McGill Normal School, with its cornerstone being laid by Lord Metcalfe, the Governor General, and in 1846 the High School moved into it.MacLeod & Poutanen (2004), pp. 121, 122 The new school building, designed by John Ostell, was described as \\"in the Domestic approaching to Tudor style of architecture\\" and was sixty yards by nineteen, not counting a portico which projected thirteen feet, with a Lecture and Examination Hall nineteen yards square.Newton Bosworth, Hochelaga Depicta: or, A New Picture of Montreal, Embracing the Early and Present State of the City and Island of Montreal (1846), p. 21 Shortly afterwards, the Royal Grammar School joined the High School of Montreal there, following the death of its Master. In 1863 the school moved again, to a new building later known as the Fraser Library and Institute, and in 1870 it acquired and occupied the Burnside Hall, which had been built in the 1850s to serve as the arts building of McGill College. In 1878, to bring the boys' and girls' schools together under the same roof, came a new building on Metcalfe Street, but the Burnside Hall was not sold until 1883. The new Metcalfe Street building also fronted onto Peel Street.The High School Magazine (Montreal, 1916), p. 28 The school building in Peel Street on fire, 1890 In 1890, the school's building on Peel and Metcalfe Streets burned down,Lovell's Historic Report of Census of Montreal, Taken in January, 1891 (J. Lovell & Son, Montreal, 1891), p. 75: \\"High School of Montreal... Between Metcalfe and Peel sts. Since the destruction of the building by fire, the Senior classes have been held in the Victoria School, St Luke st.\\" probably a case of arson, but the cause was never determined. A new school on the same site was opened in 1892.John Kalbfleisch, From the archives: Classic conflict bitterly divided Montreal school dated November 29, 2017, in Montreal Gazette online, accessed 28 December 2017 In the meantime, classes were divided between schools in Metcalfe Street and Berthelet Street and the Fraser Institute. The new building on Peel Street had thirty-two classrooms, those in the south wing for girls and in the north wing for boys. The corridors both led to an administrative heart at the centre, with gates topped by iron spikes to separate girls and boys.Flower (1949), p. 88 The site at 1455 Peel Street was later occupied by the Mount Royal Hotel,John Irwin Cooper, Montreal: a Brief History (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1969), p. 116 which in the 1980s was converted into the present-day Les Cours Mont-Royal.Alexandra Mayes Birnbaum, Birnbaum's Montreal & Quebec City, 1993 (1992), p. 177 The University Street building, begun 1914 In 1911, with the school continuing to expand, a site for a new building was acquired, and in 1914 construction began of the school's final home, at 3449 University Street. The school was able to move in during September 1915. Built in a neoclassical Beaux-Arts architectural style, used for many public buildings at the time, but unusual for schools in Montreal, the new school was designed by William Sutherland Maxwell and his brother Edward Maxwell, leading Canadian architects who were also responsible for the nearby Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Both were former pupils of the school. Finally completed in 1924, the building is shaped like the letter H and was originally planned to provide wings for boys and girls joined by a smaller central block, where shared activities were to take place. The many flourishes include four caryatids high above the main entrance and other decorative features, while the design of the staircases is believed to be unique, with separate double flights, one for up and one for down, which do not intersect. The auditorium was wood-panelled. The new building provided over sixty classrooms, on five floors, taking children all the way from first to twelfth grade.MacLeod & Poutanen (2004), p. 287 Construction of the planetarium in 1945 The school was the first in Montreal to have its own swimming pool, completed in 1924 in the basement of the new University Street building.Graham Ivan Neil, A History of Physical Education in the Protestant Schools of Quebec (1963), p. 80 There was also a shooting gallery, where sixteen people could shoot at targets 25 yards away, but at first it was used only by the boys, as was a room for sloyd. The library was common ground, but the physics and chemistry laboratories were in the boys' wing. Art was taught in separate rooms, and although the swimming pool was shared, girls and boys used it at different times. At first there was only one gymnasium, for boys, but soon the school's auditorium was converted into a girls' gym and a new auditorium was added behind the H-block.MacLeod & Poutanen (2004), pp. 277, 288 There were two sports rooms in the basement and two large recreational areas on the school's flat roof, each with views of the city and nearer views of each other.MacLeod & Poutanen (2004), p. 290 Rectors The full title of the school's principal from 1846 until the mid 20th century was \\"Rector and Master of the Royal Grammar School\\".

In 1917 she and her mother left Saint Petersburg to join her father, a captain in the merchant navy, in Harbin, Manchuria where she began her secondary education. In 1925 the family migrated to Brisbane, Australia. Christesen gained admittance in 1926 to the Commercial High School in Brisbane where she passed the Junior Public Examination in 1930. In February 1931 Christesen passed the Supplementary and Adult Matriculation Examination giving her admission to the University of Queensland from which she later graduated, receiving a Dip.Ed in 1938.

According to Jane Sullivan's obituary, \\"Nina campaigned for a new Russian department at the university, but was so unassuming that she did not apply for the job of a founding lectureship in Russian language and literature. She had to be persuaded to sit down and type an application. Nina later wrote: > \\"In every way I was obliged to begin from scratch at Melbourne University. > There was no established department, no staff, no suitable textbooks, no > library (except my own), no secretarial support, and nobody to whom I could > turn for advice on how best to structure the courses.

Continuing the ambient electroacoustic style of Ken's previous albums, UkabazUmorezU is a set of musical representations of Japanese folk traditions and \\"artificial\\" versions of passageways in the Kanagawa Prefecture during the nighttime. It was released on October 20, 2017 to favorable critical reviews. Concept and composition As with previous works by Sugai Ken, UkabazUmorezU follows an ambient electroacoustic style \\"that hums with the vibrancy of people and tradition, deftly straddling the temporal gap between past and present, myth and reality,\\" Fact summarized. The title of UkabazUmorezU translates to \\"slow and steady wins the race,\\" which, according to Ken, means \\"the perseverance of an idea through originality in a world highly influenced by trends.\\" A major concept of the album is Japanese artists' exposure to aspects of art of the Western world, such as a yokai-esque \\"atmosphere\\" \\"speaking through a Western electroacoustic motif,\\" RVNG Intl.'s press release stated. The sound of UkabazUmorezU is based on Ken's personal interest in an \\"obscured horizon.\\" UkabazUmorezU involves Ken imagining real-life passageways in the Kanagawa Prefecture during the nighttime before coming up with audio representations of \\"artificial\\" versions of them that are \\"tethered to but abstracted from the natural world\\" and contain \\"recontextualized Japanese rituals and tradition.\\" The album mainly consists of synthesizers and recordings and synthesized replications of actual places in Japan and their folk traditions. \\"Ganoubyoushi\\" involves the slapping of a Japanese hand fan with conversations in the background to represent the tradition of hand fans, while \\"Wochikaeri to Uzume\\" is about an old woman rejuvenating with the help of her respect to water. Ray Philp of Resident Advisor found it different from Ken's past works for its use of \\"unlikely\\" source material, such as the James Ferraro-style \\"sighing vocal synths\\" and \\"funny animal samples.\\" He analyzed some of the tracks, including \\"Wochikaeri To Uzume\\" and \\"\\"Ganoubyoshi,\\" felt more like \\"hallucinations\\" of random sound effects and instruments rather than sound portrayals of Kanagawa. Some songs, such as \\"Katsura,\\" \\"Doujiri\\" and \\"Wochikaeri To Uzume,\\" have cartoonish orchestral instruments and slapstick foley that add a surreal element to the album and recall Ken's childhood. A Tiny Mix Tapes found the album different from other ambient records: most ambient albums \\"resist boundaries and contouring,\\" but UkabazUmorezU is \\"more particular, insular, imaginary, and full of contours shaped by [...] moments and the spaces between them.\\" Release and reception Ken first contacted RVNG Intl. in the winter of 2015 about joining the label.Philp, Ray (August 9, 2017). \\"Rvng Intl. announces Sugai Ken album, UkabazUmorezU\\".

The first protest took place in Mashhad, Iran's second- largest city by population, initially focused on the economic policies of the country's government; however, as protests spread throughout the country, their scope expanded to include political opposition to the theocratic regime of Iran and its longtime Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. The Iranian public has showcased their fury with a wide repertoire of chants aimed at the regime and its leadership. According to The Washington Post, protesters' chants and attacks on government buildings upended a system that had little tolerance for dissent, with some demonstrators even shouting \\"Death to the dictator!\\"—referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei—and asking security forces to join them. The protests marked the most intense domestic challenge to the Iranian government since the 2009 presidential election protests. The year 2018 hosted the most serious and biggest opposition demonstrations since 2009, shaking the very pillars of this regime. However, these protests differ from the Green movement in participants, causes, goals, and chants. Unlike 2009, the 2017–2018 protests remain leaderless and disorganized. While some analysts suggest the protests are a result of unfavorable economic policies adopted by the administration of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, others say that dissatisfaction with the theocratic regime and the Supreme Leader are the actual causes of the unrest. Rouhani acknowledged on 8 January 2018 that \\"people had economic, political and social demands\\". According to Iranian authorities, protests turned violent in some parts of the country, and Iranian state television reported that the protesters attacked police stations and military personnel and installations, and started fires. As of 2 January 2018, at least twenty-one protesters and two security force members had been killed. Additionally, 3,700 demonstrators were arrested according to Mahmoud Sadeghi, a reformist lawmaker from Tehran, though official figures were much lower., Sheena McKenzie, CNN, 9 Jan 2018 On 5 January 2018, four special rapporteurs of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Iranian government to acknowledge and respect rights of protesters and end its blocking of the Internet. In a backlash against the protests, thousands of government supporters staged pro- government rallies in more than a dozen cities across Iran. Background The current Iranian regime came into power following the 1979 Iranian Revolution which saw the Pahlavi dynasty overthrown in favor of a theocratic Islamic Republic led by Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini.What it's like for Iran's expats to watch protests unfold , CNN, 3 January 2018Iranian Shah's Son on Protests: 'People Chant, 'Death to the Dictator.' This Is About Much More Than Economic Issues' , Haaretz, 12 January 2018 Since 1989, Ali Khamenei has ruled Iran as Supreme Leader, making him the second-longest serving head of state in the Middle East (after Oman's Sultan Qaboos), as well as the second-longest serving Iranian leader of the last century, after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.The Islamic Republic’s Power Centers , CFR, 5 January 2018Iran’s supreme leader blames US-Israeli plot for protests , Financial Times, 9 January 2018Nobel peace laureate Ebadi urges Iranians to keep up protests , Business Insider (Reuters), 4 January 2018 The Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, who was re-elected in 2017, had promised many changes such as a richer economy and open foreign policy but he has little power to change compared to Khamenei in the Iranian government. In 2006, following international concerns regarding the government's nuclear program, a comprehensive, international sanctions regime was imposed on Iran. In 2015, Iran negotiated a deal with the great powers of the world in exchange for economic relief. Many Iranians hoped relief from sanctions would result in economic prosperity; however, benefits have not reached the average Iranian. Instead, the benefit from sanctions relief mostly went to state firms and Setad controlled by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, estimated by Reuters at $95 billion in 2013. In 2017, according to the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, 33% of Iranians lived below the poverty line, and the gap between the rich and poor has deepened.\\"3,700 arrested during protests in Iran: MP,\\" Al Jazeera, January 9, 2018 CNN's Hamid Panah argued that these distributional developments in the economy helped stoke the protests. Recent economic hardships have appeared to incite economic protests and shine light on government corruption. President Hassan Rouhani between Yurt coal mine workers who protested to the government's lack of management In order to deflect criticism about the economy, Rouhani had been complaining for several weeks about government money going to religious institutions, which are seen as the power base of the hardliners; according to international media reports, analysts believe that hardliners started the protests as a means to embarrass Rouhani. For many Iranians, development had been slow despite the president's promise to restore the economy. Protesters registered their opposition to cuts to fuel and cash subsidies, contained in the 2018 budget proposal unveiled in mid-December, which caused widespread anger, with the hashtag #pashimanam (\\"we regret\\" [i.e., we regret our vote for Rouhani]) going viral across the country. The generous government funding of the Revolutionary Guards remained unaffected, and there were large increases for religious foundations, which are not required to declare how they spend their funds, and are \\"tied closely to powerful clerics and often serve as machines for patronage and propaganda to build support for their authority.\\" Furthermore, protesters sought an explanation as to why the government had spent a lot of money elsewhere in the Middle East. The 2017–2019 events are the largest protest in Iran since the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests. Timeline Cities by day first affected by protests: The protests began in Mashhad on December 28, 2017, and spread to over 140 cities in every province in Iran over a two-week period.. The demonstrations were started by crowds protesting across Iran, including in Mashhad, the second-most populous city. Protests spread to over 70 towns and cities, including Nishapur, Kashan, Kerman, Kermanshah, Kashmar, Rasht, Isfahan, Arak, Bandar Abbas, Ardabil, Qazvin, Hamedan, Sari, Babol, Amol, Shahinshahr, Shahrekord, Shiraz, Khorramabad, Zanjan, Gorgan, Zahedan, Urmia, Dorud, Yazd and Shahrud. According to CNBC, there was widespread protest in 80 cities in Iran. In some demonstrations, protestors provocatively chanted \\"Reza Shah, bless your soul\\", a reference to Reza Shah, the leader of Iran during 1925–41 and founder of the Pahlavi dynasty that was deposed in the 1979 revolution that led to establishment of the current government. Protestors also shouted slogans praising the (deceased) deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his son and former heir-apparent, the exiled Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran. The protesters called for Khamenei to step down, as well as tore down and set fire to posters of Khamenei in Tehran. Protesters also shouted: \\"Khamenei, shame on you, leave the country alone!\\" and \\"death to the dictator\\". Protesters also chanted \\"People are paupers while the mullahs live like gods.\\" December–January The protests in Iran erupted on 28 December 2017. Several crowds were seen protesting across Iran, including in Mashhad, the second most populous city, as well as a several hundred person protest in Tehran, the capital. There were also protests in Neyshabour, Kashmar, Yazd and Shahroud. The protests were allegedly organised on social media messaging apps. Crowds were seen chanting \\"We don't want an Islamic Republic!\\", \\"death to Rouhani\\", as well as \\"death to the dictator\\". The protests were initially for economic woes, against the high price of goods and commodities, but has \\"quickly changed\\" to protesting Iranian involvement in the Middle East, and the government itself. Demonstrations continued on Friday past sunset. Protests spread to several major cities including Rasht, Isfahan, Ahvaz, Qom, Sari, Zahedan, and Qazvin. A small number of people were arrested in Tehran. On 30 December the protests escalated, as three were killed and others wounded in shooting by Revolutionary Guards during night protests in central Iran. As Saturday coincided with the anniversary of 30 December 2009 pro-government rally in Iran, some 4000 people attended a pro-government rally in Tehran. According to state television, pro-government rallies were held in 1200 towns and cities in all. At the same time, anti-government riots spread to Tehran for the first time, where students in Tehran University chanted anti- government slogans before getting dispersed by riot police. Posters of Khamenei were torn down at Tehran University. Internet access was shut down in parts of the country, including many areas in Tehran. Iran's interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli warned that those who \\"disrupt the order and break the law must be responsible for their behavior and pay the price\\". Rahmani Fazli said in a statement on state television that \\"fear and terror will definitely be confronted.\\" VOA Persian's service identified the victims as Hamzeh Lashni and Hossein Reshno after a reporter spoke to the victims' families. Anti- government protests continued for a fourth day. Some scattered demonstrations in Tehran and families of arrested protesters gathering outside Evin prison. 200 people were arrested in Tehran on Sunday, and another 10 were arrested in West Azerbaijan province. Rouhani, in his first comments after days of anti- government demonstrations said people have the right to protest but stressed violence, vandalism and inflammatory political slogans must be avoided as these only worsen the conditions of the people. According to Iran's State media accounts, which could not be confirmed by independent sources, some armed demonstrators tried to take control of police stations and military bases but were repulsed by security forces. It was confirmed that 10 people had been killed during clashes Sunday night.

The local prosecutor in Arak told the Mizan news agency that video footage, which was not released, showed the dead protester stabbing himself with a knife. Many Iranians, including a number of lawmakers, have called into question the declaration by Iranian authorities that two deaths in custody were \\"suicides\\" and that another death was a \\"terrorist\\" who died in clashes with security forces. According to ISNA, a group of lawmakers called for an investigation into these deaths, saying relatives and eyewitnesses had questioned the official line.In Iran, Protester ‘Suicides’ Stir Anger and Calls for Accountability , The New York Times, 14 January 2018, Thomas Erdbring According to French newspaper Le Monde, 25 people at all died during these demonstrations.

Khamenei had previously claimed that it paved the way for \\"cultural invasion\\" of Western values, expressing deep concern in 2016 over the spread of English to \\"nursery schools,\\". Media coverage and censorship In statements by the Iranian Minister of Interior Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, said that the improper use of social media was \\"causing violence and fear\\", further stating that \\"such behavior will be smashed\\". Iranian state news channel Islamic Republic of Iran News Network was banned from covering the protests. Reports by independent media organizations in Iran was restricted. However, Iran's state media covered Rouhani's comments about the protests which said \\"people have the right to criticize\\" but the authorities would not tolerate antisocial behavior and that criticism is \\"different from violence and destroying public properties\\". =Internet= In some regions, Iran's internet service providers, which are either directly owned by or closely tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, blocked internet access in several cities as protests continued. Previously, several satellite networks in Iran were jammed, and internet and telephone in some areas were cut. VPNs, which had offered a backdoor to the internet, were also turned off. According to OpenDNS's BGP Stream, on 1 January 2018 Iran's internet traffic dropped by nearly 50%. Meanwhile, the number of Iranians making use of TOR has increased significantly during the protests. =Telegram= Telegram messenger played a major role in spreading the news about the protests and served as the primary platform to unify the protesters. On 30 December, the Iranian government requested the closing of a Telegram channel called \\"Amad News\\" (AMAD standing for Agaahi, awareness, Mobaareze, combat & Democracy) operated by Roohollah Zam which called for use of handmade explosives against the security forces. The request was accepted by Telegram since it also violated their terms of service and policies, and its CEO Pavel Durov received criticism for complying with the request. The channel was reinstated on the next day with a different title (Sedaye Mardom, lit. Voice of People) after the admin who published the post calling for violence was dismissed. On 31 December, the Iranian government blocked access to Telegram after it had refused to ban another channel. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted that \\"Iranian authorities are blocking access to Telegram for the majority of Iranians after our public refusal to shut down telegram.me/sedaiemardom and other peacefully protesting channels.\\" The government lifted restrictions on Telegram on 13 January 2018. but again applied permanent restrictions after late April 2018. Iranian government created another version of the app that works beside telegram called Talagram or Telegram Golden and one more clone called Hotgram with overhauled censorship and features. =Instagram= Iran blocked Instagram on 31 December 2017. The access was restored on 6 January 2018. Arrests By 14 January, over 440 protesters who were arrested during the Tehran riots had been released, according to Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi. On 19 February, Iranian MP, Mohammad Kazemi claimed that a lower court in Malayer had sentenced a fifteen-year-old boy to five years in prison for pulling down the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran in a city square during the protests. Opinions A man protesting to the economic situation Conservative Iranian politician and economist Ahmad Tavakkoli blamed the protests on economic conditions experienced by the poor, for which he blamed the Rouhani administration, the policies of International Monetary Fund, and problems experienced by depositors due to non-regulation of financial institutions. Sadegh Zibakalam, a reformist Iranian academic and pundit, blamed the protests on the lost hopes of young educated unemployed Iranians, who he said felt betrayed given the Rouhani administration's earlier promises of change. He also opined that use of monarchist slogans was only the youths' way of expressing their anger at the establishment, not an indication of real support for the Pahlavis; he said he could understand the grievances of the protestors but considered them counterproductive. As deposited by the guardian, the protest mostly comprises Iranian workers under the age of 25. Iranian author Majid Mohammadi posited three causes for the protests: government corruption, economic hardships, and religious authoritarianism. In his opinion, religious authoritarianism was the most salient target of the protests since protesters had come to believe that the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was determined to preserve the status-quo and not susceptible to reform. According to Trita Parsi, the founder and president of the National Iranian American Council, the main participants in these protests were different from those involved in the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests. Parsi suggested that the protesters were mainly those disillusioned with the Iranian reform movement or who never supported it. He said Iranian Reformists had been surprised by these protests and had not come out in support of the protestors. American journalist and political commentator Bret Stephens wrote that \\"real democracies don't live in fear of their own people\\", referring to the crackdown on protesters, and the Internet. He said that one of the reasons the protesters called for Khamenei to step down was frustration over his control of a financial organisation called \\"Setad\\" that was worth at least $95 billion in 2013 (according to a report from Reuters). According to Aljazeera, the leaders of Iran have pointed fingers at foreign media for overstating the extent of the protest. The New York Times columnist and commentator on Iranian politics Roger Cohen, argued that \\"Trump Is Right, This Time, About Iran\\", writing that even if Trump's support of protestors \\"sounds hollow\\", he is right to tweet that the \\"wealth of Iran is being looted\\" by a \\"brutal and corrupt Iranian regime.\\" Whereas Philip Gordon, senior fellow in US foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in the same newspaper that the best thing the President could do to support Iranians was \\"Be quiet and do nothing\\", arguing that if \\"Mr Trump blows up the deal and reimposes sanctions, he will not be doing the opposition a favor but instead giving Iranians a reason to rally to – rather than work against – the government they might otherwise despise.\\" Elliott Abrams, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for the Reagan administration, criticized The New York Times on 31 December for what he said was misleading coverage of Iran's protests. In his view, the news coverage diminished the value of Iran's protests, limiting it to the economic sphere, while the slogans suggested that the political dimension of the demonstrations was also significant. According to Scott Waldman, climate change may have helped spark the protests as Iran has been suffering from a cycle of severe droughts from the 1990s, suffers from dust storms, and mismanaged water resources. The rising temperatures may be an underlying cause for economic difficulties that led to the protests.Climate Change May Have Helped Spark Iran’s Protests , Scott Waldman, 8 January 2018, Scientific American Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, suggested that Iranian June protests were \\"orchestrated\\" from outside the country. He said: \\"those protests are not happening spontaneously. They are happening because of many of our people in Albania [which hosts an MEK Iran compound] and many of our people here and throughout out the world.\\" Some Iranian watchers believe that the protests were constituted by traditional Iranian Politicians, according to Vox. Reactions National Khamenei condemned the protests and described them as \\"Fitna\\" like the 2009 protests. * Khamenei blamed \\"the enemies\\" of the Islamic Republic for the unrest, saying, \\"In the events of the past few days, the enemies of Iran are deploying every means at their disposal including money, arms and political and intelligence support to coordinate making troubles for the Islamic establishment\\".Iran's enemies to blame for unrest, says supreme leader, as nine die overnight , The Guardian, 2 January 2018, Saeed Kamali Dehghan * In early 2018, Rouhani phoned French president Emmanuel Macron to ask him to act against the Mujahideen-e-Khalq (People's Mujahedin of Iran), an exiled Iranian opposition group based in Paris, and accused them of fomenting the recent unrest. * Rouhani stated that Iranian people have an inalienable right to express their criticism about their country's problems, adding that protests should not be expressed in a manner that makes people feel their lives and the revolution have been threatened. He asked security forces to avoid the use of violence \\"as they did so far\\". In reference to US President Trump's expression of support for the protestors he said, \\"this man in the US who pretends to have sympathy for our people today should keep in mind that he was the one who called the Iranian nation terrorists months ago. This man who is against Iranians wholeheartedly has no right to feel sympathy for the people of Iran.\\" * Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, responded to Trump's tweets saying \\"the Iranian people do not tolerate the opportunistic and hypocritical slogans of US officials\\", and \\"the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran establishes democratic structures for legal protection of the civil rights of the people and the possibility of pursuing these demands within the framework of the law is fully possible\\". *Ali Shamkhani, the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said that the US, UK and Saudi Arabia were inciting riots by their use of hashtags and social media campaigns. * The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps issued a statement and pledged that the organization will closely observe \\"future acts of sedition\\" and \\"in supporting the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist, will allow no harm to be inflicted upon the country\\". * Former Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hamid Reza Asefi, said Saudi Arabia is seeking to exploit and misuse of what he termed \\"civil rallies and freedom of expression\\" and claimed that Saudi regime is trying to incite chaos in Iran for their own political ends. He said Iranian people and the government would never let the Saudi government or any other country to take advantage of the protests and even interfere in Iran's domestic issues. He further said the protests are not being held against the government but against economic problems. * Farah Pahlavi, the exiled widow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the former shah of Iran, responded in support of the protests on her Instagram and Facebook accounts, and Reza Pahlavi II, the son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Farah Pahlavi, posted a supportive message on his Telegram channel on the second day of the protests. *Judiciary Chief Sadeq Larijani ordered prosecutors and law enforcement to take serious measures against rioters and vandals, warning they would be punished firmly. *On 29 December 2018, Hassan Khomeini the grandson of the founder of the Islamic Republic, in response to the growing discontent across the country said that there was no guarantee that the regime would not be overthrown.

According to Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, videos posted on social media platforms showed protesters being beaten, and government buildings, banks and religious centres burning. Over 1,000 protesters had been arrested. Nikki Haley stated the events that happened during the previous week in Iran needed the attention of the world. Although the US overcame Russian attempts to block a UN security council discussion of the Iranian protests, it lost European support to act against Iran. While the UK, France and Germany agreed with the US on protection of protesters' rights, they used the debate to reject American efforts to undermine the nuclear deal with Iran. French representative François Delattre said that the event was not a threat to international peace and security and said, \\"It is up to the Iranians, and to the Iranians alone, to pursue the path of peaceful dialogue.\\" China, Russia and some other nations considered the protests as internal issue which did not relate to the security council.

Colesville, September 2017. There are around 70,000 Muslims in Maryland in the United States as of December 1992, according to the American Muslim Council. This is the tenth highest number of Muslims of all U.S. states, representing 1.4% of the Muslim population in the country, as well as 1.4% of the total population of Maryland, at the time of the report. History Baltimore has had a Muslim community as far back as 1943. Masjid Ul-Haqq was established as a Nation of Islam mosque in 1947, on Ensor Street. The congregation later moved to 1000 Pennsylvania Avenue. The mosque was known as Mosque Six. The mosque moved to 514 Wilson Street in the late 1950s, where it is currently located. Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad spoke at the mosque in 1960 to over a thousand people. After the death of Muhammad in 1975, the mosque's congregants converted to Sunni Islam and it became known as Masjid Ul-Haqq. In 1979, the number of Muslims in Baltimore and its suburbs was estimated to be 3,000–5,000 by Islamic Society of Baltimore co-founder Dr. Mohamed Z. Awad. As reported by The Baltimore Sun, in 1983, the number of Muslims in Baltimore was estimated to be several thousand. In 1985, the number was estimated the number to be around 15,000, as well as 40,000 Muslims living in the Baltimore–Washington region. In 1995, Maqbool Patel, the president of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, estimated the number of active Muslim families in the state to be 5,000, with 1,500 being in the Baltimore area. As of 2000, it is estimated that Frederick County has 200 Muslim families. In 2000, the Islamic Society of Frederick planned the construction of a mosque along with a Muslim cemetery, which would be the first mosque in Frederick County and the first Muslim cemetery in Maryland. The land they wanted to build the mosque on, however, was off-limits for development, and their appeal to the county commissioners to connect to the county water and sewer lines was met with a tie vote, barring their ability to build a mosque.

All four crew members on board survived.  Aircraft  The aircraft was a Boeing 707-436, registered as G-APFK, and first flew in 1960. Its construction number was 17712 and its four engines were Rolls-Royce Conway 508 turbines. The aircraft entered service with BOAC on 29 September 1960, transferred to BEA Airtours on 30 December 1971 and finally British Airtours on 1 April 1974.  Flight  On board were: a 29-year-old first officer trainee; a 48-year-old flight commander; a captain trainee who was acting as flight engineer; and a supervisory first officer seated behind the commander. After the standard pushback and engine starting procedures, the commander relayed the crosswind information from the control tower to the trainee first officer, who was in control for the take-off. The wind forecast was 18 knots, increasing to 35 knots. No flight number was assigned to the training session.  Accident  After receiving take-off clearance from the tower, the crew taxied the aircraft to runway 31 for departure. The trainee first officer commenced the take-off run by applying full power to the engines. As the crew rotated the aircraft from VR speed (125 knots), the flight commander pulled back engine No.1's thrust lever, saying “Engine number one’s failed.”, which was followed by, “I have it.” The crew applied left rudder trim and the aircraft climbed to 20–30 feet. The aircraft began to descend and the left wing dropped 20 degrees. The engine simulated as failing struck the left edge of runway 31. The aircraft then yawed and rolled to the right, and engine No.4 struck the ground. The aircraft slid sideways down the runway, tearing off all four engines and collapsing the landing gear while bursting into flames. It came to rest at the intersection with runway 3. During evacuation one crewman was injured.  Investigation  The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) began an investigation the day after the accident. According to the flight data and cockpit recorders, an engine failure would be simulated as an exercise for the two trainees to quickly demonstrate procedures for restarting or shutting down the failed engine. The AAIB determined the pilots did not deal with the failure as quickly as recommended. Usually, a pilot must deal with failed engine in 1 1/2 seconds, but the trainee first officer took 2–3 seconds.  Probable cause  After investigating the crash for one year and four months, the AAIB published its final report in September 1978, stating the probable cause of the accident: \\"A loss of control which resulted from a delay in taking full corrective action during a simulated outboard engine failure exercise during take-off.\\"  Aftermath  G-APFK was damaged beyond repair in the accident and fire. It was written off in November 1978 and scrapped in 1979.

The show was previously known as Krown Countdown U until 2019 when the show moved to TSN across Canada.http://footballcanada.com/mullin-elected-as-new- president-of-football-canada/ The show generally airs on Wednesday at 1pm ET and Friday at 3:30pm ET on TSN1 or TSN2. Previously, it was a recap and pre- game show broadcast by CHCH-DT across Canada, Thursday nights at 11:30 pm ET after local news and sports during football season. In the 2018 season the show's online distribution partner was CBC Sports. \\"KCU\\" complimented CHCH's coverage of OUA college football which was broadcast periodically on Saturday afternoons during the college football season. It was aired prior to the start of OUA game broadcasts with a 1:00 p.m. ET kickoff. In its current form, the program is pre-recorded at HubCast Studios in Surrey, BC as a panel show, with one member of the panel participating via Skype from Central Canada. The show recaped mainly USports football games, features, news and analysis of the week's upcoming games with additional content focusing on Canadian content in NCAA football, Football Canada national teams, and the Canadian Junior Football League. Seasons  Season one: CIS Countdown, 2011  It first aired as CIS Countdown in September 2011 with Jim Mullin as host and Chad Klassen and Andrew Wadden as commentators, providing an overview of Canadian university football games on SHAW TV throughout Western Canada. The show was developed in conjunction with MRX and Associates as a means to promote the 2011 Vanier Cup at BC Place Stadium. In the first season, there were 10 episodes produced.  Season two: Krown Canadian University Countdown, 2012  There were changes for the 2012 season, after Krown Produce became the title sponsor of the show. This included a name change to \\"Canadian University Countdown\\". Ryan Sullivan joined Wadden on the highlight desk as an anchor team, eliminating most of the duties of the host position. Mullin shifted to the panel with Hec Crighton Award winning quarterback Billy Greene joining the show as a full-time panelist and the two would remain together through the 2013-14 season. The number of stations carrying the show grew as well, with COGECO TV carrying the show in Kingston and Windsor-Essex. Cable 14 broadcast the show throughout the Hamilton region. The show was integrated into Canada West broadcast coverage on SHAW TV. Additional panelists from across the country were included via Skype, including former Sherbrooke quarterback J.P. Shoiry, Rogers Sportsnet contributor Donnovan Bennett, Justin Dunk, Charles- Antoine Sinotte and freelance writer Andrew Bucholtz rotating in the guest panelist position. There were 16 episodes produced, running from September through December.  Season three to six: Krown Countdown U on Shaw TV and affiliates, 2013–2017  The show changed its name again for the 2013 season, to the current Krown Countdown U. The show expanded to 20 episodes, with monthly off-season episodes running from January through May. Rogers TV stations throughout Ontario picked up the show in Ottawa, Guelph, London and Kitchener-Waterloo. Eastlink cable picked up the show for broadcast throughout the four Atlantic provinces. The format remained mainly intact from the previous two seasons. The show went on location to start the Canada West Football season on Shaw TV, with the kickoff game in Saskatoon in 2013 and 2014. The show became the pregame show for Krown Canada West Football on Shaw. The on-screen antics of Wadden and Sullivan developed a minor cult following in the football world. In a feature on the Laval Rouge et Or football team Newsweek wrote, \\"There is a weekly highlight show, Krown Countdown U, that resembles what would happen if ESPN’s College GameDay' mated with SCTV’s Bob and Doug McKenzie. During a recent highlights package, co-host Ryan Sullivan quipped of a player who ran back a punt for a touchdown, “He is gone, like a bullet that was shot out of a gun that shoots bullets.” In 2014, former UBC Thunderbirds and Queen's Gaels offensive lineman Gord Randall replaced Greene, who left Canada to play football in Europe. Also in 2014, former UBC Thunderbirds head coach Shawn Olson hosted a segment named \\"X's and Olson\\" which uses a telestrator to break down plays in 12-man football. Through 2015 and 2016 the format remained the same, with Justin Dunk assuming most of the guest panel spots from Toronto. There were 15 in-season episodes from late August through November, and monthly episodes from January through CFL/NFL draft season in May. The show's producer won the Paul Carson Award in 2016 for promotion and development of varsity sports in Canada. = KCU and the Northern 8 = L. David Dube is the principal owner of Krown Produce and has underwritten the cost of production through sponsorship of the program. Dube and Mullin as project partners started planning and discussion around the Northern 8, a proposed schedule of competition which would place the best CIS/USports football teams from across the country in a nationally televised game of the week. Much of the discussion surrounding the proposal was content for the panel on KCU. During the height of the first attempt to broaden competition in the winter of 2014-15, KCU produced a specific show about what the Northern 8 was, with Dube explaining the concept. = Season seven: The move from Shaw and Canada West to CHCH and national coverage, 2017–2018 = There were many changes for the 2017 season with the shutdown of Shaw TV operations in Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. Canada West moved to an online pay-per-view model with games and paired with SaskTel Max for games of the week. Mullin, who had been the play-by-play voice of Canada West football for 10 years was not included in the new conference broadcast package. This resulted in the show finding a new home on CHCH, which significantly increased the household reach across Canada to 6.8 million and aligned the product with the OUA. An online edition was posted on 3DownNation after the show was distributed to CHCH. The anchoring team of Wadden and Sullivan was replaced by Mullin as the anchor, with Randall and TSN 1050 and Toronto Argonauts play-by- play voice Mike Hogan completing the roster of the full panel. Olson continued X's and Olson. With Mullin off the play-by-play beat, more focus was placed on NCAA Football and Canadian players on Division I teams. This included Mullin anchoring from Knoxville, Tennessee and Grand Forks, North Dakota along with on-site interviews and visits in Atlanta, Georgia, Athens, Ohio, Seattle, Washington and Buffalo, New York. There was also an episode produced out of the CHCH studios in Hamilton after the Vanier Cup. Season eight: Partnership with CBC Sports and IFAF In July 2018, CBC Sports, International Federation of American Football, and KCU announced a partnership to broadcast major IFAF events within Canada on CBC's online service. As part of the agreement, CBC also became the online home for KCU TV.  Season nine: TSN Gridiron Nation presented by Krown Produce, 2019 - current  The show rebranded in 2019 with the move to TSN as \\"Gridiron Nation presented by Krown Produce\\" a.k.a. \\"Krown Gridiron Nation on TSN\\".

The 2017 #Power7 accurately reflected the eventual outcome of the Vanier Cup, with the Western Ontario Mustangs in first place, and the Laval Rouge et Or in second for the final weeks.

The program is also carried on the Rawlco Radio Network to affiliates in Saskatoon and Regina. The program ran from late August to December, and mid-January to mid-May and is one hour in duration. Mullin co-hosted from Vancouver with Hogan at the TSN 1050 studios in Toronto. Wadden provided the \\"Canadian Box Score\\" which recapped and previewed the college sports week in both Canada and the United States from a Canadian perspective. During the football season, Gord Randall was a regular contributor in an editorial position. The radio program covered football, college hockey and basketball in the winter-spring months. It was almost exclusively a football show in the summer and fall.

It runs diagonally from the southeast to northwest (but signed as north-south) from SC 41 and SC 51 in Johnsonville to U.S. Route 521 Business (US 521 Bus.) and US 601 Bus. in Kershaw. Route description SC 341 in Johnsonville SC 341 begins at the intersection of Georgetown Highway (SC 41/SC 51) and Broadway Street in central Johnsonville. SC 341 heads west along East Broadway Street through the town's business district. At a railroad crossing, the road name changes to West Broadway and continues past additional businesses. After exiting the city limits, the road's name changes to Lake City Highway but passes some other small businesses, houses, and churches. Further from the city, more farmland begins to surround the roadway. At the community of Prospect Corner, the road name becomes Johnsonville Highway but the highway's surroundings is generally the same. Before entering Lake City, SC 341 passes in front of some commercial and industrial warehouses. Upon entering Lake City, SC 341 travels through it on Main Street, first through a residential neighborhood with an elementary school located along it. At Church Street, US 378 Bus. joins SC 341 on a concurrency through the city. Commercial businesses line both sides of the street upon the beginning of the concurrency. In the center of the city, the two routes intersect US 52\\\\. After passing Matthews Road west of the downtown area, the road enters another residential neighborhood but then heads into an area with more farmlands. Upon its intersection with US 378, US 378 Bus. ends and SC 341 has a short concurrency with US 378. Continuing northwest from US 378, SC 341 travels along Olanta Highway. At the community of Camp Branch, the highway intersects SC 403 at its southern terminus. SC 341 continues through mostly farmland and afterwards intersects SC 541 at its southern terminus. Shortly thereafter, the road enters the town of Olanta on Hampton Street. Within the town, the road passes in front of many houses, some small businesses, a library, and a school. In the center of town, SC 341 intersects US 301 then begins to curve to the north. The road heads through a mix of farmland and woods north of Olanta where it exits Florence County and enters Sumter County. After an intersection with SC 53, SC 341 begins to curve to the northwest and has an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) at its exit 146. After entering Lee County, SC 341 reaches the community of South Lynchburg where it intersects SC 58 at its western terminus. Soon after, it enters the town of Lynchburg where in the center, it has an intersection with US 76\\\\. It continues northwest along Lynchburg Highway through farmland and intersects US 401 about northeast of Elliott. At the settlement of Wisacky, SC 341 reaches the northern terminus of SC 527. Now approaching the city of Bishopville, the highway passes in front of Lee Central High School and has an interchange with I-20 at exit 120. North of the Interstate, it passes the entrance to Lee Correctional Institution. Upon entering the city of Bishopville, it takes the name of East Church Street where it heads through a residential neighborhood then transitions to the business district. In the town center, SC 341 reaches Main Street which carries US 15 through the city. SC 341 and SC 34 (which came into this intersection from West Church Street) form a concurrency with US 15 and head northeast through Bishopville. Outside the city limits, SC 341 breaks off the US 15/SC 34 concurrency and heads north-northwest through farmland and woods on Bethune Highway. The highway enters Kershaw County and soon afterwards heads into the town of Bethune. It travels through the town on Main Street where it intersects US 1 and SC 346\\\\. Outside of Bethune, it heads through the pine forests of the Sandhills region. After crossing the Little Lynches River, the road enters Lancaster County. It then enters the town of Kershaw on South Minor Street. At Marion Street, SC 341 turns to the west while SC 157 begins and travels east on Marion Street and SC 157 Truck / SC 341 Truck head north on North Minor Street. The highway heads into the center of town where SC 341 ends at Hampton Street which carries US 521 Bus./US 601 Bus. Marion Street continues west to intersect US 501 and US 601 at Matson Street. Major junctions Kershaw truck route SC 341 Truck is a truck route for trucks traveling through Kershaw. For its entire length, it is concurrent with SC 157 Truck. Its southern terminus is at the intersection of Marion Street and Minor Street which is also where SR 157 has its southern terminus and SR 341 passes through. As trucks are banned on East Marion Street through Kershaw, the truck route bypasses the downtown area. The routes head north along North Minor Street for three blocks to Hilton Street, US 601\\\\. The northbound directions of the two truck routes run along southbound US 601 forming a wrong-way concurrency. At North Hampton Street, the highway reaches US 521 Bus. and US 601 Bus. Continuing west along Hilton Street, they cross a railroad track before the truck routes terminate at US 521 (North Matson Street).

Thiele (1895–1993) was an influential chemical engineering researcher at Standard Oil (then Amoco, now BP) and Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. He is known for his highly impactful work in chemical reaction engineering, complex reacting systems, and separations, including distillation theory. Early life and education  Ernest Thiele, born on Dec. 8, 1895, grew up in Chicago, Illinois. In 1916, he earned an A.B. degree from Loyola University in Chicago. He was stationed at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign with the U.S. Army, where he completed a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1919. In the fall of 1922, matriculated to MIT where he began graduate studies under the direction of Professor Robert T. Haslam; he earned is M.S. degree in 1923 and a doctoral degree in 1925 with a thesis on steam-carbon reactions.  Career  Before starting his graduate degree at MIT, Thiele worked for six months for Swift and Company in Chicago and later in Baltimore as a process analyst, before being employed with Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company as a chemical engineer from 1920 to 1922. After completing his doctoral thesis on steam-carbon reactions, he developed (jointly with McCabe) a graphical method of design for fractionating (i.e., distillation) columns as a transformational publication in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry in 1925. This approach to the design of distillation columns was rapidly adopted in undergraduate textbooks and has remained the traditional approach to teaching distillation to undergraduate chemical engineers for almost a century. Thiele joined the Standard Oil Company of Indiana (then Amoco, now BP) as a chemical engineer in 1925. He continued with this company for 35 years becoming an assistant director for research in 1935 and associate director for research in 1950. During the period of World War II, he contributed to numerous technologies related to nuclear materials processing and atomic energy including a heavy water extraction facility, the Lexington Project for the design of nuclear-powered aircraft, and as a consultant to the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. During 35 years at Standard Oil, Thiele exhibited remarkable creativity and produced 17 landmark publications, and 27 U.S. patents that served as the foundation of chemical engineering. Classic engineering papers include his breakthrough paper on the efficient design of distillation systems via computational methods with co-author R.L. Geddes published in 1933 in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Further work led to the development of solvent extraction of lubricating oils. Another landmark contribution was the 1939 Industrial & Engineering Chemistry paper that described the Thiele modulus, a dimensionless quantity describing the boundary between reaction- controlled and transport-controlled catalytic particles. Following retirement from Standard Oil, Thiele became a professor of chemical engineering at Notre Dame where he taught courses in thermodynamics, reactions, instrumentation, process control, and simulation. Following 10 years at Notre Dame, Thiele returned to Chicago and lived the next 27 years in the Skokie-Evanston area. Thiele died Nov. 29 1993 in the Presbyterian Home in Evanston.  Honors  Thiele was awarded the Founders Award by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1966 and elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1980. In 1971, the University of Notre Dame awarded Thiele an honorary doctorate for his many contributions to chemical engineering. He was a member of the Chicago Chemists Club and the American Chemical Society, in addition to being a fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). In 1986, the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of Notre Dame established the Thiele Lectureship in Chemical Engineering. The lectureship recognizes excellent contributions to chemical engineering by young members of the chemical engineering profession. The first Thiele lecture was presented by Professor Douglas Lauffenburger, with Ernest Thiele in attendance. The lectureship is given every year, with the presenter selected by the faculty of Chemical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.

She has been described as \\"about the only famous Washington artist who was actually born in D.C.\\" Biography Born in Washington, D.C., Perrie was interested in art from an early age, winning a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York. After completing her time there she returned to Washington, where she would become a major figure in local artistic circles. Late in the 1880s she took a position as a teacher at the Art Students League of Washington, where she was also a student, and to whose governing board she would be elected. She taught watercolor at the Corcoran School of Art for over 20 years, and was also on the faculty at the Gunston Hall School. As a painter she was best known for her work in watercolor, though she also produced oil paintings and etchings; she favored landscapes and seascapes, but she painted in other genres as well. Perrie was among the founders of the Arts Club of Washington, and was also a charter member of both the Society of Washington Artists and the Washington Water Color Club, in whose shows she appeared from 1891 until 1921. She also served on the board, and as an officer, in each organization. She also belonged to the Washington Society of Fine Arts and the Washington Handicraft guild, and showed work at Corcoran exhibitions both regionally and nationally; other venues at which she exhibited included the National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the New York Watercolor Club. Perrie exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Among the awards which Perrie received during her career were the first and second Corcoran prizes at the Washington Water Color Club's 1904 and 1900 exhibitions and a silver medal in the Appalachian Exposition of 1910. In the summer of 1921 she traveled to Gloucester, Massachusetts to spend the season, dying there during her visit. Her body was returned to Washington, and she was interred in Glenwood Cemetery alongside other members of her family. She was honored with a memorial exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Among Perrie's pupils was Susan Brown Chase. Stylistically, Perrie's work encompasses aspects of both Impressionism and realism. Three of her pieces, an etching of William S. McPherson and two paintings, a watercolor of flowers and an oil on canvas of a harbor scene in Gloucester, are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. She is also represented in the collection of the Arts Club of Washington. Many of her other works have remained in private hands. Gallery File:Bertha E.

The film focuses on Richard and Rachel, a middle-aged married couple of New York City creatives, who are desperately trying to have a child by any means possible. The film had its world premiere on January 18 at the Sundance Film Festival. It was released on October 5, 2018, by Netflix. Plot Richard (Paul Giamatti) and Rachel (Kathryn Hahn) are a middle-aged couple desperately trying to have a child. After multiple failed attempts at artificial insemination, they attempt in vitro fertilisation. The couple learn that Richard has a blockage that is not letting him produce sperm, forcing him to undergo a surgery that puts him $10,000 in debt to his brother Charlie and his wife Cynthia. At the same time they are also attempting to adopt a child after having previously being matched with a pregnant teenager from Arkansas who was looking to give up her child but then stopped contacting them. After the IVF fails, their doctor floats the idea of using a donor egg to inseminate Rachel which would raise their chances of success from 4 to 65 percent. Rachel is initially against the idea, but slowly begins to contemplate it with Richard's encouragement. Meanwhile, Cynthia's 25-year-old daughter, Sadie, decides to leave her college writing program to finish in absentia and go live with Richard and Rachel, with whom she is already very close. Rachel, who struggled with the idea of an unknown egg donor, decides that she wants to ask Sadie for her eggs. To their surprise Sadie quickly agrees, both because she loves Richard and Rachel and because she thinks the egg donation will bring meaning to her life. During Thanksgiving, Sadie informs her family that she will be donating her egg to Richard and Rachel, much to her mother's displeasure. Despite the fact that Richard and Rachel tell Cynthia they will not go through with the donation without her consent, they decide to go through with pre-screening. Richard, Rachel and Sadie happily go through the egg donor treatments together, but Sadie is told at an appointment that she is not developing eggs quickly enough. Determined not to let Richard and Rachel down, she increases her drug dosage on her own. The egg retrieval is a success, but Sadie becomes ill. Richard and Rachel take her to the hospital, where they learn of the increased dosage. Sadie moves out of their apartment. Richard and Rachel go through with the implantation, but it is a failure. While Rachel is devastated, Richard admits to being relieved that they are finally done with trying as their marriage and intimacy have suffered. Sometime later they drop Sadie off at the Yaddo colony, where she will take up a residency as a writer. She thanks Rachel for her help getting in, but Rachel informs her she did nothing to aid her application and that Sadie did it all on her own. Nine months later, Richard and Rachel are celebrating Halloween when they receive a call from another woman looking at them as potential parents to adopt her child. They drive to a restaurant, where they wait to meet the woman. Richard moves from his usual opposite seat to sit next to Rachel and hold her hand.

In 1877, Donald was a part of the 'Texas Jack Combination' formed by Texas Jack Omohundro and debuted in St. Louis that year. Donald toured the U.S with his family to promote patent medicines with the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company of Boston and later with the Oregon Indian Medicine Company formed by T.A. Edwards. In 1881 Edwards published a biography of McKay titled Daring Donald McKay; or, The last war- trail of the Modocs. In 1892, Donald McKay and his family settled on the Umatilla Indian Reservation where McKay resumed his work as a translator for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. McKay died on April 19, 1899 in Pendleton, Oregon and is buried at Saint Andrews Mission Cemetery.

The Cline Buttes form a silicic volcanic center, active before the emplacement of the Deschutes Formation, a late Miocene to early Pliocene volcanic lava flow deposited between 7.5 and 5.3 million years ago. Their lava flows cover a collective area of approximately , and were created as part of the John Day Formation during the late Oligocene or early Miocene epoch, approximately twenty-five million years ago. The primary rock that makes up the mountain is rhyolite with some basalt also present. Most of the rhyolite is white or light-gray. It was formed when volcanic magma cooled below the earth's surface before erupting onto the surface. There are also some obsidian flow-bands exposed in a rock quarry on the northeast flank of the mountains. The Cline Buttes have been significantly eroded over time, leaving a rounded dome shape with three separate crests. They are now covered with of sandy loam soil in most areas with rhyolite and basalt outcropping on the steeper slopes.Peterson, Norman V., et al, Geology and Mineral Resources of Deschutes County, Oregon (Bulletin 89), Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Portland, Oregon 1976, p. 5, 8–9, 11.Sherrod, David R., Edward M.

The rhyolite lava flow deposits at Cline Buttes show a roughly porphyritic texture, with oligoclase phenocrysts making up between 1 and 2 percent of the minerals. These flows have been devitrified and show a normal-polarity magnetization. Cline Buttes volcanoes also produced rhyodacite, which varies in color from light gray to red-brown and are similarly sparsely porphyritic. The basalt lava flows produced a now-weathered hill on the western flank of the Buttes, which is not topped by rhyodacite and therefore likely formed after that lava erupted, despite having a lower relative elevation.McDannel, Angela K., \\"Geology of the southernmost Deschutes basin, Tumalo quadrangle, Deschutes County, Oregon\\", Oregon State University, 1989, p. 16.  Environment and ecology  To the west of the Cline Buttes are woodlands covered with western juniper transitioning to ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and fir forest. The forest extends to the timberline on the central Cascade peaks, approximately away. The area south and east of the mountain is drier. It is typical of Oregon's high desert country dominated by juniper and sagebrush.Witty, Jim, \\"Cline Butte\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 17 March 2006.Morical, Mark, \\"Biking the Buttes\\", The Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 8 April 2015.

Birds of prey found in the area include golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, northern harriers, and prairie falcons. While prairie falcons are uncommon in most parts of central Oregon, the area around the Cline Buttes has a native breeding population.

Cline (1850–1926), a pioneer dentist and early land developer in central Oregon. A nearby waterfall on the Deschutes River, northeast of the buttes, is also named after the dentist. Cline immigrated to Oregon in 1853, settling in the Willamette Valley. He moved to central Oregon in 1871. In 1886, he filed a homestead land claim along the Deschutes River, near the buttes and falls that now bear his name.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Cline Falls\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 210.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 148\\"Former Resident Dead\\", News-Review, Roseburg, Oregon, 22 July 1926, p. 2. Later, Cline attempted to establish a town along the west bank of the Deschutes River, near the foot of the Cline Buttes. At its peak, the town of Cline Falls had a post office, a school, two stores, two hotels, a newspaper, a power plant, and 500 residential lots for sale. However, the community eventually failed when the first railroad route through the area was built on the opposite side of the river, through the neighboring town of Redmond.Hole, Leslie Pugmire and Trish Pinkerton, \\"Building a Community\\", Images of America: Redmond, Arcadia Publishing, Chicago, Illinois, 2009, p. 28. In 1904, gold was discovered on the Cline Buttes by Otto Retzlaff and C. P. Becker. The first gold ore was found in a ledge outcrop on the south flank of the mountain.Berry, Ralph, \\"Oregon's Gold Rush\\", High Desert Voices, High Desert Museum, Bend, Oregon, February 2017, pp. 1–2.\\"Gold Find in Crook County\\", \\"Morning Oregonian\\", Portland, Oregon, 8 April 1904, p. 5.\\"Gold Ore on Cline Butte\\", \\"Crook County Journal\\", Prineville, Oregon, 14 April 1904, p. 1. More than 50 mining claims were quickly filed.\\"Steps to get Gold\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 15 April 1904. P. 1. However, when the ore was assayed it was found to be uneconomical to extract, so mining operations never got underway.\\"Cline Butte Assays\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 10 June 1904. P. 1. In 1985, development of Eagle Crest Resort began along the Deschutes River, east of the Cline Buttes. The original development was on the east side of the Cline Falls Highway. In 1996, Eagle Crest began selling residential lots west of the Cline Falls Highway, between the highway and the eastern base of the Cline Buttes. This development was completed in 1993. Later, a third phase of Eagle Crest housing was developed along the northwestern base of the Cline Buttes. This area is separated from the Eagle Crest's second development by approximately one mile of Bureau of Land Management property. There is a paved easement road that connects the two areas, running along the northern base of the mountain.Binole, Gina and Brian K. Miller, \\"Eagle Crest: More than Putting Along\\", Portland Business Journal, Portland, Oregon, 1 May 1998.\\"Eagle Crest Resort map\\", Welcome to Eagle Crest, Eagle Crest Incorporated, Redmond, Oregon, 2007. Today, the Bureau of Land Management administers the Cline Buttes and much of the land around the mountain. The bureau has established Cline Buttes Recreation Area, a area that is being developed for a wide range of recreational uses.Cline Buttes Recreation Area (map), Prineville District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Prineville, Oregon, accessed 23 August 2017. A service road runs up the south side of the mountain and then along the upper west flank to the main summit. The road supports a Federal Aviation Administration facility located at the summit. The facility houses a radio beacon used for aircraft navigation. There is also a road running along the east flank of the mountain. It leads to a rock quarry located on the northeast side of the mountain.  Recreation  Mountain bike trail on Cline Buttes In the summer, recreation opportunities in the Cline Buttes area include hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, bird watching, and scenic viewing. There are separate mountain trails for hikers, mountain bikes, and horseback riding. During the winter, the area is usually available for some recreation activities since snow accumulation on and around the mountain is not excessive in most years. The Cline Buttes are particularly well known for their mountain bike trails. Several of the bike trails are narrow single-track paths that follow the slope around the buttes to vista points. There are also two downhill trails that start at the top of the highest peak. These are extremely challenging routes with very steep rocky sections. Those trails are recommended for expert bikers only. Many of the lower trails are narrow with occasional downhill jumps, suitable for bikers with intermediate-level skills.\\"Cline Butte #1 Downhill\\", MTB Project, REI Co- op, Sumner, Washington, accessed 1 December 2017. From the summit of the Cline Buttes, visitors have an excellent view of Cascade peaks to the west as well as the high desert country of Deschutes and Crook counties to the east. Visitors can see as far north as Mount Hood and as far south as Mount Bachelor from the Cline Buttes' highest summit. To the west are the central peaks of the Cascade Range, dominated by the Three Sisters. To the northeast lies Smith Rock State Park, and farther to the east are the Powell Buttes and the Ochoco Mountains. From the summit, the views to the south and southeast are of the lower sections of the Cline Buttes Recreation Area located on the Matson Plateau west of the Deschutes River with Pilot Butte and Paulina Peak in the distance.

The organization has its headquarters in Herod, Illinois. History The ancestors of the Vinyard Indian Settlement sought refuge in Illinois after crossing the Ohio River near Shawneetown in 1810. This date was cited by Clyde Vinyard, who lived from 1890 until 1980. This region is north of Karber's Ridge in Hardin County. This first band was composed of eighty Kispokfa, Shawnee. They were fleeing from Ohio militiamen who were trying to prevent this group from uniting with the forces of Tecumseh at Prophetstown. This band intended to find refuge among the French settlers at Shawneetown. Encouraged by the salt miners and fur trappers at Shawneetown, the band of refugees moved into the hills. The Shawneetown settlers feared that the militia would take reprisals for assisting this group. The Shawnee refugees arrived at a location near High Knob. They settled among Irish-German immigrants who had the surname of Vinyard. Relations between the two groups was friendly. The Shawnees took the name of Vineyard partially to honor the people who assisted them, as well as to hide from the local authorities. Many abandoned children were found among this group. Intermarriage was common between Shawnees and non-natives. Out of fear of removal, many of the people of this region hid their native origins. In recent times, the people of the Vinyard Settlement have been involved in a campaign to buy property in their ancestral homeland in the Ohio Valley. The enrolled citizens of the Settlement do not wish to build a casino, an activity done by many other Native American Tribes. The tribe seeks to build ecologically oriented businesses for the purpose of providing employment for both natives and non-natives. This is part of a five-year plan.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of the Decemvirs, and from thence down to the Second Punic War, they regularly held the chief magistracies of the Roman state. After this, however, they fade into obscurity, and are only occasionally mentioned. The nomen Poetelius is sometimes confused with Petillius, and can be found with either a single or double 'l'.Dionysius, x. 58.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 435 (\\"Poetelia Gens\\"). Branches and cognomina The only distinct family of the Poetelii is Libo, a sprinkler, probably referring to one who pours libations during a sacrifice. Most of this family also bore the surname Visolus. Livy refers to the consul of 360 BC as Gaius Poetelius Balbus, but other sources refer to him as Libo.Chase, pp. 111, 112.Livy, vii. 11. Members * Quintus Poetelius Libo Visolus, one of the plebeian members of the second decemvirate, which held power at Rome from 450 to 449 BC, before being overthrown.Livy, iii. 35.Dionysius, x. 58, xi. 23.Broughton, vol.

Libo Visolus, consul in 360 BC, defeated the Tiburtines and the Gauls, and was awarded a triumph. As tribune of the plebs in 358, he had passed a law intended to curb ambitus (bribery). He was consul again in 346 and 326, and in the latter year passed the lex Poetelia Papiria, abolishing a form of debt bondage.Livy, vii. 11, 12, 27, viii. 28.Diodorus Siculus, xvi. 9, 72.Censorinus, De Die Natali, 17.Broughton, vol.

Libo Visolus, dictator in 313 BC, during the Second Samnite War, he had some success against the Samnites, but some authorities credit the consul, Gaius Junius Bubulcus Brutus. Niebuhr and Müller suggest that it was he, rather than his father, who brought forward the lex Poetelia Papiria.Livy, viii. 23, ix. 28.Diodorus Siculus, xvii. 113.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. iii, p. 155 ff, 293.Broughton, vol.

Despite his victories over the Samnites, he was denied the honour of a triumph.Livy, ix. 24–23.Diocorus Siculus, xix. 73.Broughton, vol. I, p. 157. * Publius Poetelius, one of three ambassadors sent to Syphax, the king of Numidia, in 210 BC.Livy, xxvii. 4.Broughton, vol. I, p. 281. * Gaius Poetilius C. f.

Function  This gene encodes a member of the DEAH (Asp- Glu-Ala-His) subfamily of proteins, part of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box family of RNA helicases. The encoded protein functions in translation initiation, and is specifically required for ribosomal scanning across stable mRNA secondary structures during initiation codon selection. This protein may also play a role in sensing virally derived cytosolic nucleic acids. Knockdown of this gene results in reduced protein translation and impaired proliferation of cancer cells.

It was released on June 1, 2005, through Pony Canyon. It is her first album in three years, since Jewelry Box, and her first album released under Pony Canyon in a day short of six years, since Full of Love. Background Kudo refers to Tsukikage as her favorite album of hers. In an interview with Real Guide, she explains that it is the first album to make her feel the same intense feeling of accomplishment she felt when she finished recording her fourth studio album, Joy. She wanted her fans to experience the album as a journey with a story, which is why Tsukikage begins and ends with an instrumental intro and outro, her first album since Karelia to do so. The musical direction for the album was influenced by feedback from fans; Kudo explained to Real Guide that, around May 2004, she started requesting uptempo tracks from producers because her fans had been expressing through letters their desire to hear more upbeat songs with powerful vocals. Kudo singles out the latin-inspired \\"Tsukiyo no Sabaku\\" and \\"Break of Still\\" as two standout songs from the record. She considers \\"Replay\\" a throwback song for her older fans, and \\"Shinkaigyo\\" a mature song about independence. The title of the album, which has the characters for \\"moon\\" and \\"shadow\\", is meant to represent the two sides of life, the positive and the negative. She liked the \\"moody vibe\\" associated with the moon. Speaking on the recording process, she states that, even though she was on a tight schedule, the recording sessions for the album were never strained, as being in the recording booth is Kudo's favorite part of creating an album.

Style According to the Philadelphia Tribune, Brown \\"primarily works in acrylic, although [he] uses a variety of mediums and styles to express his interests in Afrocentric themes, Ancient Egyptology and dance — it’s a style that combines past and present art to create a sense of realism, mysticism, and beauty.\\" In addition to his paintings and illustrations, Brown has also worked in the field of sculpture.

A wartime officer holding the rank of Praporshchik in the Imperial Russian Army during the First World War, he subsequently joined the Red Guards, and was appointed the Commander of the Nikolayevsk Front and the Nikolayevsk Military District of the Red Army of the Russian SFSR and the Okhotsk Front of the People's Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic. He took an active role in establishing Soviet power in Siberia and the Far East as a participant in the Civil War. He is best known for the role he played in the Nikolayevsk incident in 1920, in which he massacred the entire population of Nikolayevsk-on-Amur and burned the town to the ground.  Early life and career  Yakov Ivanovich Tryapitsin was born on April 25, 1897 in the village of Savasleyka in the Muromsky District of the Vladimir Province of the Russian Empire, in the family of a peasant, Ivan Stepanovich Sidorov-Tryapitsyn. He studied at the 4-year school, which he graduated from with a commendable record. In 1915 he entered the work of an assistant to the machinist on a locomotive in the factory's inner yard of the Mordovshchik shipyard. In the summer of 1916, he was enlisted in the Kexholm Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. He fought in the First World War - rose to the rank of Ensign (Praporshchik), and was twice awarded the Cross of St. George. In the spring of 1918, he was demobilized from the active army, in connection with the Peace of Brest-Litovsk, and upon returning to Russia, he joined the Red Guard. He subsequently participated in the suppression of the Samara insurrection from June to October 1918. In the autumn of 1918, he was sent through the Eastern Front to Siberia.  Partisan commander  At the end of 1918, traveling through Omsk, where he met with a fellow soldier, he left for Eastern Siberia and the Far East, according to the memoirs of the soldier to, \\"Fight for Soviet Power.\\" In January 1919, he was arrested in Irkutsk by Admiral Kolchak's forces, but managed to escape from prison. At the end of March of the same year, Tryapitsyn arrived in Vladivostok, where he joined an underground organization consisting of port loaders, who stocked up weapons and recruited volunteers to fight the Japanese interventionists supporting the White Movement. Under the leadership of Tryapitsyn, a raid was carried out on the Vladivostok military garrison depot, after which, fearing persecution, he fled with other underground workers into the taiga. From the end of the spring of 1919 - he served in the Tsimikhinsky (Sucean) Partisan detachment, led by G.M. Shevchenko in Primorye, and engaged in combat with the Japanese, Americans, and White Russians near the town of Suchan. As a result of disagreements with the commander of the detachment, he left to the river Iman, where he organized his own Partisan detachment. In the summer of 1919, he moved with his detachment to the Amur River, to the Khabarovsk District, where he continued his fight against the White Army and the intervening Allies. The operational area of the actions of the Partisan detachment, under his leadership, was in the district of the Kruglikovo and Verino stations of the Ussuri railway. On November 2 and 3 of 1919, at a meeting of representatives of various Partisan detachments in the village of Anastasievka in the Khabarovsk District, it was decided to create a military revolutionary headquarters under the command of D.I. Boyko-Pavlov. Disagreeing with the decision by the assembled council, Tryapitsyn left Anastasievka before the arrival of the Red Army with his detachment of only 19 fighters. Fulfilling his vow, on November 10, 1919, a detachment of Tryapitsyn consisting of 35 initial fighters began their march from Vyatka to Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. In the village of Malmyzh, a meeting was held with the Partisan detachment of Ocevilli-Pavlutsky. The former commander of this detachment, Mizin, became the first deputy of Tryapitsyn. On November 26, the Partisan cavalry detachment near the Pulsa telegraph and postal station was ambushed by a punitive detachment of Kolchak's main force, and was defeated. After that, the White Guards moved to Zimmermanovka, where the main forces of the Partisan detachment of Tryapitsyn were concentrated. During the defense of Zimmermanovka, the guerrillas, under the leadership of Tryapitsyn, routed the attackers. Pursuing the surviving White Guards, the Partisans took the village of Kalinovka. After learning of this defeat, the chief of the Nikolayevsk-on- Amur garrison, Colonel Medvedev, mobilized carts from the local population, assigned soldiers and volunteers, and sent a detachment to assist his beleaguered forces. Tryapitsyn left to engage in negotiations with the commanding officer of the White detachment, Colonel Witz. The appearance of the commander of the Partisan movement, from the position of Kolchak's men, and the transfer of letters and gifts from their relatives had a strong demoralizing effect on them. During the negotiations, Witz responded to Tryapitsyn with a refusal to surrender, but, realizing that his detachment was disintegrating, gave an order to retreat to De-Kastri Bay, as the road to Nikolayevsk was cut off. However, this order was carried out by only a few, the bulk of the soldiers subsequently defected to the side of the Partisans of Tryapitsyn. As a result, the Partisans detachment began to number about 1,400 soldiers.  Command of the Nikolayevsk Front  In the village of Lyci, a council of Red Army commanders was convened, at which a number of decisions were taken on regarding the transformation of the Partisan army into a Front of the regular Red Army, subsequently known as the Nikolayevsk Front. The staff of the Red Army headquarters of the Nikolayevsk Front included Yakov I. Tryapitsyn as Front Commander, D.S. Buzin-Beach as Deputy Commander, T.B. Naumov-Medved as Chief of Staff, A.I. Pokrovsky-Cherny as Staff Secretary, and F.V. Zhelezin, A.I Komarov, and S.I Sheriy as senior staff members. It was this headquarters that began to reorganize Partisan detachments into regular regiments of the Red Army. Since September 1918, Nikolayevsk was occupied by Japanese troops during the intervention in the Far East. By early 1920, in the city, in addition to the Russian population of around 15,000, and White detachments of about 300 men, a Japanese garrison of 350 men from the 14th Infantry Division of the Japanese Imperial Army under the command of Major Ishikawa was stationed, in addition to about 450 Japanese civilians. On February 10, 1920, the soldiers and partisans of the Nikolayevsk Front, with the assistance of some former soldiers and officers of the former fortress of Chnyrra, who controlled the approaches to Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, captured and transferred it to the Sakhalin Revkom, together with its weapons. After the shelling of the positions of the Japanese units near Nikolayevsk from the guns captured by the Red Army in the fortress of Chnyrra, under the pressure of foreign consulates, the Japanese recalled the declaration of Lieutenant General Shiroodzu, commander of the 14th Japanese Infantry Division, on the observance by the Japanese army of neutrality in the civil war in Russia from 4 February 1920, and they sent representatives to the negotiations that took place on February 25-28, 1920. Two White Army officers were in attendance as observers: Captains Murgabov and Nemchinov. The Japanese were forced to sign an agreement on neutrality, on the basis of which parts of the Red Army entered the city. Under the agreement, parts of the Japanese Army were to maintain neutrality and remain in the places of their deployment. At the funeral of 19 former Soviet and party officials who were arrested and executed by White and Japanese forces earlier that year, Tryapitsyn addressed a speech to the inhabitants of Nikolayevsk: In the hands of the Extraordinary Commission (Cheka), were almost all documents of the White counterintelligence, with which nearly all employees implicated were arrested and subsequently shot. Those officials and representatives of the pre- revolutionary city council, who in 1918 signed a joint petition to the Japanese Emperor with the request to send troops to the Amur to aid them in defeating the Red Army were also arrested and executed. On March 12, 1920, a congress of Soviets of the Sakhalin Region was held in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, which marked the restoration of Soviet power in the whole region and enshrined the legal sovereignty of the Russian SFSR over the territory of Northern Sakhalin and the Lower Amur.  Far Eastern Command  On March 10, 1920, Tryapitsyn issued an ultimatum to the Japanese garrison to voluntarily disarm and turn over their weapons and ammunition to the Red Army, to which he was sure the Japanese would refuse, giving the Red Army the excuse it needed to expel the garrison from the city. In the early morning hours of the 12 of March, however, Japanese soldiers launched an attack on the central command of the Nikolayevsk Front, stationed in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. As a result of the sudden attack by the Japanese, Tryapitsyn himself was seriously wounded and received two injuries as a result, while his deputy, Mizin, and his Chief of Staff, T.B. Naumov, were both killed. At least 150 soldiers and commanders of the Nikolayevsk Front were killed and more than 500 soldiers were wounded. At the first stage of the fighting in the city, the initiative, thanks to the surprise attack and the loss of leadership by units of the Red Army, belonged to the Japanese garrison, which was supported by a large part of the Japanese population. But a day later, the Gorno-Amguno-Kerbinsk regiment, dislocated in the village of Kerbi, led by its commander, I.A Budrin, approached Nikolayevsk and assumed leadership of the fighting in the city. The fighting lasted several days and ended with the victory of the Red Army. By the evening of March 14, the main forces of the Japanese were defeated, and on March 15 at noon the last group capitulated, only surrendering when the Japanese High Command ordered them to do so. Most of the Japanese died in battle, while 117 soldiers and 11 women were taken prisoner. Even so, Tryapitsyn decided to take revenge, which resulted in the execution of the surviving garrison along with many Japanese civilians. After this, Tryapitsyn was free to start a reign of terror and execute all those he deemed dangerous to his forces. Among foreign citizens, the British manager of one of the largest fisheries in the town was arrested and shot on the charges of counter-revolutionary activity. Tryapitsyn believed that the attack on the Red Army in Nikolayevsk was in fact a rehearsal for Japan for the coordinated attack of its occupying forces in the Russian Far East on Soviet authorities and military garrisons of the Far East. During the formation of the Far Eastern Republic, Tryapitsyn expressed his disagreement with this decision. From a telegram to Moscow: Despite the vehement disagreements of Tryapitsyn with the decision to establish the Far Eastern Republic, on April 22, 1920, according to the order No. 66 of the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Revolutionary Army, he was appointed Commander of the Okhotsk Front. By the same order, Sergey Lazo was appointed commander of the Primorsky Front.  Nikolayevsk incident and death  In late May, as a Japanese relief expedition approached, Tryapitsyn ordered the evacuation of all Red Army soldiers, staff, and Soviet personnel from the city, and subsequently executed all of the remaining inhabitants of the town, both Japanese and Russian, including children and the elderly, and burned the town to the ground. All Japanese still in Nikolayevsk were massacred. Being short on ammunition, one of the methods to execute the victims was to stab them with a bayonet and thrust them in a hole under the ice of the river Amur. Several thousand inhabitants of the town were killed in this fashion, many others were beaten to death with rifles. Hundreds of others were shot on the banks of the Amur. The buildings of the town were set on fire or blown up with explosives following the massacre, as well as the fortress of Chnyrra and any weapons, artillery, ammunition, medical supplies, and provisions that could not be secured by the Red Army. Following the retreating army along the banks of the Amur River, on June 3, 1920, Tryapitsin left with his staff. Upon learning of the massacre, the Japanese government lodged a protest against the Bolshevik government in Moscow, demanding compensation. Tryapitsin had already lost much of his favor with the Central Committee in Moscow due to his frequent railings against Soviet policy and criticism of the central government. In response to the Japanese demands, Tryapitsin, along with his entire Staff and regimental commanders, were arrested in the town of Kerbi in Primorsky on the orders of the Soviet government on July 7. I.T. Andreev, a member of the Bolshevik-aligned Central Committee of the Sakhalin Region and a former White Army officer, presided over a brief improvised trial in which Tryapitsin, his staff, regimental commanders, and the Chief of Staff of the Okhotsk Front, Nina Lebedeva, 32 in total, were condemned to death and subsequently shot on July 9. Even so, the Japanese government felt that this was not sufficient, and used the incident as an excuse to occupy the northern half of Sakhalin island, and to delay diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union until 1925.

Life  The son of a grocer, Fischer was born in Berlin, Germany, on 29 June 1908 but emigrated to the United States with his family in 1913, attending high school in Long Island. He later attended the Rand School of Social Science and married Ruth Miller, a secretary, in 1934. Fischer became a sports reporter and then police reporter for the Long Island Daily Press (1929–31), following this with stints writing and editing at the Labor Voice (1931–32), Socialist Call (1934–36), and Modern Monthly. In the 1936 election he ran as a candidate for New York's 14th district, and in 1938 he ran for the New York State Senate (12th district, Manhattan), both times under the Socialist banner. With journalism providing an unreliable income, at a friend's recommendation Fischer tried his hand at writing for the pulps. Among the hundreds of pulp titles available at that time, Fischer was taken by the horror/terror titles, the so-called \\"shudder pulps\\": A Dime Mystery, Terror Tales, Sinister Stories, and others. He sold his first story immediately, a horror tale (\\"The Cat Woman\\", Dime Mystery, November 1936). While he often wrote under his own name, this first story and others came out under the pseudonym “Russell Gray”, a name he had used during his newspaper days when writing two pieces for the same edition. Other pulp stories appeared under the pen name Harrison Storm, but this pseudonym was abandoned after 1943. Initially Fischer became known as a purveyor of stories within the \\"weird menace\\" and \\"defective detective\\" subgenres, the latter being detectives with distinctive physical flaws. However, as Fischer recalled, these markets ended quite suddenly: > In 1940 I was living in Florida with my family when the whole terror-horror > market collapsed.... I got a letter saying the magazines had folded, and all > my unpublished stories were returned. They just stopped, just like that. It > was a shock. Just one day the market was gone. With his original markets gone, he moved to more general detective and crime fiction, with stories appearing in the best publications in the field: Dime Detective, Black Mask, and others. Ultimately he published several hundred stories, claiming to have written some two million words of fiction from 1937 to 1941 alone. Fischer published his first novel, So Much Blood, in 1939; as the pulps died off in the late 40s and early 50s, novels became his primary output, though several of his short stories still appeared in the digest magazines (like Manhunt and Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine) that were the pulps' successor. Several of his books were published by Dell and Lion Books, including the popular Ben Helm series of P. I. novels. Famous paperback original publishing house Gold Medal Books took on Fischer on the recommendation of John D. MacDonald, releasing several of his novels in the 1950s; House of Flesh (Gold Medal #123, 1950) sold some 1.8 million copies. An early member of the Mystery Writers of America, he was the editor of one of their annual short story collections, 1953's Crooks' Tour, and he is known to have written at least one erotic novel in 1970 (Domination, Olympia/Ophelia Press) under the pen name \\"Jason K. Storm\\". In the 1960s Fischer worked as executive editor for Collier Books and education editor at the Arco Publishing Company. His last novel was 1973's The Evil Days, written after the demands of his job and a lengthy writer's block had greatly reduced his output. Following this he spent his later years between a summer home in a socialist cooperative community in New York’s Putnam County (the Three Arrows Cooperative Society) and the Mexican town of San Miguel de Allende, where he sometimes gave lectures to the expatriate retirees about his adventures as a mystery writer. Nearly blind towards the end of his life, he died of a stroke while on a Mexican vacation with his wife on 16 March 1992. Noted critic Anthony Boucher once wrote that Fischer displayed \\"a warm understanding of human relationships\\". Fischer himself described his \\"usual manner\\" of writing as containing \\"movement and suspense with very little violence\\" and as being about \\"ordinary people in extraordinary situations\\".

Biography  Born in LaRue, Ohio, McMillan attended the Western College for Women and Westminster College in Pennsylvania. She then studied under George Luks and Hans Hofmann and at the Pratt Institute before traveling to Paris for further instruction with André Lhote and at the Fontainebleau School of Art. She is known to have been active in Washington, D.C. at least as early as 1931, continuing her activities there until at least 1967. Beginning in 1931, for over twenty years she taught painting and art history at the National Cathedral School, from which she retired in 1955. Long a member of the Arts Club of Washington, she had one-woman shows there in 1938 and 1947. Other solo shows occurred at George Washington University and at the Studio Gallery in New York City. She also belonged to the Society of Washington Artists, at whose 1932 exhibition she presented an oil titled Taos, New Mexico, and th Washington Water Color Club, and she exhibited with both the National Association of Women Artists and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors during her career. An article which she penned about the Society of Washington Artists was published in 1963 by the Columbia Historical Society. Milligan eventually moved to Tryon, North Carolina to join the artists' colony there. She died in Tryon; her body was returned to Ohio for burial, and rests in the Bellefontaine City Cemetery in Bellefontaine. Milligan worked in oil, pastel, and watercolor during her career, producing landscapes, portraits, and still- lifes. A 1948 oil-on-canvas still-life is currently owned by the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. A 1972 portrait of Abby Merchant, an acquaintance from the Tryon artists' colony, is currently in the Polk County Historical Museum in Tryon. She is also represented in the collection of the New Mexico Museum of Art.

He was the last Landheer (or landlord) of Batoe-Tjepper, today's district of Batuceper. History Family background Born in Tangerang, Dutch East Indies in 1872, Tan hailed from a family of landlords and Chinese officers, part of the 'Cabang Atas' or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. The Chinese officership was a high-ranking government position in the civil bureaucracy of the Dutch East Indies, consisting of the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen. His father, Tan Tiang Po, served as Luitenant der Chinezen in Tangerang from 1877 until 1885, while his grandfather, Luitenant Tan Kang Soey, sat on the Chinese Council (Dutch: 'Chinese Raad'; Hokkien: 'Kong Koan') of Batavia or modern-day Jakarta, capital of Indonesia. Tan's paternal great-grandfather was the tycoon Tan Leng (died in 1852), who was part of the powerful Ngo Ho Tjiang opium partnership. Through his mother, Lim Hong Nio, Tan was a grandson of Lim Soe Keng Sia and Tan Bit Nio, as well as a great-grandson of Tan Eng Goan, the first Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia (1802-1872). As a descendant of Chinese officers, Tan Liok Tiauw held the hereditary title of Sia from birth. Tan's sister, Tan Him Nio, was married to Khouw Yauw Kie, Kapitein der Chinezen (died in 1908). His daughter, Corry Tan Pouw Nio (1900-1961), was married in November 1917 to the prominent, half-Austrian, colonial politician Loa Sek Hie (1898-1965). He also had two sons born to two different concubines: August Tan Tsjiang Kie and Jan Tan Tsjiang Bie. Life Mookervaart canal, G.F.J. Bley (1925-30) Tandjong West in the 18th century Tan grew up between his family's townhouse in downtown Batavia and their principal private domain, the particuliere landerij of Batoe-Tjepper, an agricultural estate in Tangerang. He was given a traditional Chinese education, but also had a private Dutch tutor. Tan's father, Luitenant Tan Tiang Po, retired from his role as Landheer in the late 1880s, and handed over the management of Batoe-Tjepper to his son. Aged only 16, Tan Liok Tiauw not only improved the running of Batoe-Tjepper, but further developed an existing factory on the estate that manufactured building materials, roof-tiles and other terracotta products. Many important colonial buildings in Java, in particular in Batavia, were built using materials from the factory. In July 1923, Tan hosted Dirk Fock, the 30th Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies at Batoe-Tjepper as part of the latter's official visit to Tangerang. Tan inherited other agricultural landholdings from his father on the latter's death in 1912. Many of these estates were consolidated in the landholding firm N.V. Landbouw Maatschappij Tan Tiang Po, which was incorporated in 1899. The company controlled the private domains of Rawa Buaya, Tanah Kodja, Pondok Kosambi, Minggoe Djawa and Kapoek, stretching from the western part of modern-day Jakarta to Tangerang. A wide range of agricultural crops were cultivated on these landholdings: ranging from rice, coconut, other fruits and vegetables, and on to grass for animal feed. Tan acquired a number of other business ventures. Together with the philanthropist O. G. Khouw (his brother-in-law's cousin) and D. N. van Stralendorff, he took over the tea and rubber estates of Tendjo Ayoe and Perbakti in the Preanger highlands in 1907. These plantations were among the largest privately-owned estates in Sukabumi, and had been established in the 1870s by the tea pioneer B.B.J. Crone, an uncle of the Indo-Dutch writer E. du Perron. As Director, Tan Liok Tiauw also headed N. V. Landbouw Maatschappij Tandjong West, a syndicate of landlords which purchased the old, eighteenth-century ‘particuliere land’ or estate of Tandjong West in 1917, today part of Jagakarsa in South Jakarta. Beyond Java, Tan played a significant role as a pioneering plantation owner in Lampung on the southern tip of Sumatra, having acquired the formerly struggling British-owned Lampong Coconut Estates, Ltd. These Sumatran estates grew coconut and pepper, and — like many of Tan's other landholdings — were run by professional European estate managers. Tan died in 1947 in Batavia, was buried at his family's private burial grounds at Kebon Besar in Batoe-Tjepper, Tangerang.

Written in 1990, the song was first released on the band's album Hey, O.K that year by Kobza International, but did not gain popularity until its release on the album of the same name in 1994. Since then, it has become an anthem of sorts for VV fans, often closing their concerts. The song inspired the music festival of the same name in 2004.  History  The song was written in 1990 by vocalist/accordionist Oleg Skripka. It was first released on the album Hey, O.K by Kobza International that year, and in 1991 on a Kobza compilation. In 1994, the song became the title track of the band's official debut album, released on SBA/Gala Records in Russia and by the band on cassette. Since 1998, it is occasionally used to end the band's concerts.

History It is possible that Euthydemus was a son of a certain Apollodotus (born 295 BCE) and a grandson of Sophytes, a satrap or ruler of Bactria in around 300 BCE. Euthydemus was a satrap of Sogdiana that was married to a sister of Diodotus II, the son of the original rebel, Diodotus.\\"Two Remarkable Bactrian Coins\\" RC Senior, Oriental Numismatic Society Newsletter 159 He usurped the throne from Diodotus II or perhaps Antiochus Nikator and became ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Later on in his reign, he faced an invasion by the younger and ambitious Antiochus III the Great. He was defeated on the Arius but successively waited out Antiochus in his capital Bactra. His peace treaty with Antiochus granted his son Demetrius I a marriage to an unnamed daughter of Antiochus. His son Demetrius I would go on to invade northern India and establish the Indo-Greek kingdom. After Demetrius's sons Agathocles, Euthydemus II and perhaps even Demetrius II rule over the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms, it becomes harder to pinpoint which of the following rulers were related to each other, or even if they were members of the Euthydemid dynasty. It is possible however, that the powerful king Menander I was a member of this dynasty. Rulers Precise members of this royal family cannot be fully reconstructed due to the lack of evidence and only a remaining vast coinage of following rulers. Demetrius's successor, Agathocles, left behind extensive coinage that helped reconstruct part of the dynasty.No undisputed coins of Demetrius I himself use this title, but it is employed on one of the pedigree coins issued by Agathocles, which bear on the reverse the classical profile of Demetrius crowned by the elephant scalp, with the legend DEMETRIOU ANIKETOU, and on the reverse Herakles crowning himself, with the legend \\"Of king Agathocles\\" (Boppearachchi, Pl 8). Coins of the supposed Demetrius III also use the title \\"Invincible\\", and therefore are attributed by some to the same Demetrius (Whitehead and al.) Some of the more certain rulers are: * Euthydemus I (260-195 BCE) * Demetrius I (222-180 BCE) * Euthydemus II ( c. 200-185 BCE) * Pantaleon (190-180 BCE) * Agathocles (fl. 190-180 BCE) * Demetrius II (fl. 175-140 BCE) Possible members, although not certain, can be: * Apollodotus I (c. 180-160 BCE) * Antimachus I (c.171-160 BCE) * Antimachus II (c. 170-165 BCE) * Menander I (c. 165/155-130 BCE) married Agathokleia, father of Strato I * Strato I (c. 125-110 BCE) * Demetrius III (c. 110 BCE) Following these rulers, it becomes increasingly hard to date or connect them to any family, as they may have been usurpers.

A country house first built around 1690, it was given protected status in January 1952. Alterations were made to the structure for John Mytton by Robert Mylne around 1766-68 and further work was undertaken during the early- to mid-19th century, for some of which time the property was owned by his son, also called John but often referred to as \\"Mad Jack\\" Mytton. A certain Richard Mytton had been granted a five-year lease of the whole estate in April 1539 and required to live at Halston, to provide hospitality, and to find a priest for the chapel.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/salop/vol2/pp87-88 The Mytton family was granted ownership of the Halston estates in 1562–63. The estate was split up for sale in 1847, some years after the death of Mad Jack. George Wright of Manchester bought the hall and of the grounds for £116,095. The nearby private timber-framed chapel is also Grade I listed. Its history is obscure but predates the current hall structure. The parkland in which the hall is situated was requisitioned for use as a 1084-bed US military hospital during World War II. Little evidence of this survives but it comprised over 100 buildings, mostly to the north and north-west of the hall itself. The hospital was disused by 1954. Together with facilities at Penley, Llanerch Panna, Oteley Deer Park and Iscoyd Park, it formed a part of US Army Hospital Center 804.

He used to preach at major, large-scale Christian spiritual gatherings such as Maramon Convention in Kerala and Keswick Convention in Cumbria, North West England.  Early life  Gregson was baptized at the now defunct St. Luke's, London, Finsbury (a former Anglican parish). Later, he became a member of Baptist Church, ordained as a minister and chose to become a missionary to India. After the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 was concluded, he was sent to India to serve as a missionary of Baptist Missionary Society during 1858 to 1869 and was mainly stationed at Agra. On 26 December 1861, he married Mary Anne, eldest daughter of N Brice, at Dinapore Cantonment while he was based in Monghyr (Munger, Bihar).  Early ministry and Indian army chaplaincy  Gregson had served in British India as an Army Chaplain and he worked hard to realize total abstinence from alcohol among soldiers of British Indian Army. In 1862, he founded the Soldiers Total Abstinence Association (STAA). Under Gregson's leadership, the STAA grew in importance by absorbing regimental temperance societies. One military admirer described him The Apostle of Temperance in the British Army. He observed, in 1886, that \\"To such an extent has it prevailed, that the heathen regard the use of intoxicating liquor as a sign of a Christian.\\" In 1873, due to Gregson's hard work during his stay as a missionary at Agra, the Havelock Memorial Chapel at Agra was constructed in memory of Henry Havelock, who had founded the first Baptist Chapel of Agra in 1832. From 1879 to 1886, Gregson served as the pastor of Union Church, Mussoorie (that was officially established in 1869). During this period, he ensured regular Sunday School classes, mid-week Bible reading meetings at homes. He also organized regular meetings at the Soldiers' Institute in nearby cantonment town of Landour and at the Woodstock School there.  Return to England  Gregson belonged to the Elm Grove Baptist Church and after completing his service in India, Gregson retired to Southsea by 1886. Gregson addressed the Keswick Convention of North England in 1886. Although a Baptist, he chose to be a part of the Keswick Evangelist team because of their swing to Modernism. In 1892, Gregson assumed the leadership of the Soldier's Institute at Portsmouth from its founder Sarah Robinson aka soldier's friend. However, he could hold this responsibility only for two years and his friend Sidney Smith had to take over in 1894, as Gregson was once again travelling to India.  Visits to South Africa, Ceylon and India  In 1894, as an ex-Indian Army Chaplain, he left England once again to visit South Africa, Ceylon, and India. In 1894, Gregson visited South Africa during a time when Andrew Murray, Keswick and Higher Life leader, was ministering there. In 1895, Gregson held special mission services in Bombay. In April 1895, Gregson preached again at the Lanouli camp (an old Methodists camp with tents, located at Lanouli or Lanowli known as Lonavla today, and renovated in 1893 ). It was during this particular meeting at Lanouli camp, where Pandita Ramabai, the famous Indian social reformer (who had already become a Christian in 1887), experienced a deep spiritual awakening and professed to have been touched by the Holy Spirit. After this meeting, she and her friend together had a conversation with Gregson where she asked several questions which he answered based on the Biblical Scripture much to the satisfaction of Ramabai. This encounter with Gregson, an active promoter of the Keswick spirituality, inspired Ramabai to attend and address the Keswick Convention during a return journey back from the US to India.  Visit to Kerala  In 1896, Gregson visited Kerala and during February 1897, spoke at the Maramon Convention, which is regarded as the largest Christian convention in Asia. Although a Baptist preacher, he was sympathetic to the Plymouth Brethren perspective and helped the local Christians to establish the first Brethren Assembly in the central Travancore kingdom (now Kerala). His visit to Kerala was organised by C. P. Thomas from Ayroor, a village near Kumbanad in Central Travancore. Gregson held many talks and classes with the priests and laymen within the Mar Thoma Church, after obtaining approval from the Malankara Metropolitan. Due to his preaching, many felt assured of receiving salvation. Gregson organized a month-long Bible course based on Paul the Apostle's Epistles to the Colossians and Romans. As a Baptist preacher, he also discussed Baptism as an important subject in his talks. As a result of his activity, few priests and laymen had decided to receive Adult Baptism, even though they were already baptized as children. These actions were not acceptable to the Mar Thoma church's traditional teachings and therefore, many Mar Thoma Church leaders became infuriated and banned Gregson from ministering in the Church. Although Gregson had to leave, as an indirect result of his mission work, in 1897, the vicar of Kumbanad and Eraviperoor Mar Thoma Churches, P E Mammen (Kumbanattachen), received baptism from Handley Bird, a Brethren missionary, at Kunnamkulam. Eventually, his ministry led to the establishment of Brethren movement, supported by Volbrecht Nagel who celebrated the Holy Supper on 19 March 1899 at Kunnamkulam.  Death  He died at Totnes, Devon County in 1909 at the age of 73.  Books  Gregson authored a number of works across three decades: * A plea for the dis-establishment of the Irish Church : by J.

In November 1914 Abbeywood State School was established, closing on 31 December 1969. It was at 402 Cridlands Road ().

(1977) Over the Fence. Arthur H. Stockwell, Ilfracombe, Devon. Prior to this the area was known interchangeably as the 'Overseas Settlement' or the 'Oswestry Grange Settlement', these names arising from the fact that a number of the newly surveyed blocks for selection were reserved for new immigrants and many of these had arrived on the ship Oswestry Grange. These early settlers formed a progress association which agitated government authorities for improvements such as roads, schools at both Abbeywood and nearby Speedwell and a branch railway line which was later opened in 1923 to a new terminus at Proston, including a station at Hivesville. The nearby village of Hivesville was for many years the main town of business for these early farmers. One of the first selectors to take up a bush block for development into a farm was John (Reuben) Bull with his wife Louisa and six children in 1910.

The Avon Green Belt, also known as the Bristol and Bath Green Belt (or Bath and Bristol Green Belt), is a non-statutory green belt environmental and planning policy that regulates urban expansion and development in the countryside surrounding the cities of Bristol and Bath in the South West region of England. It covers areas in Bristol, South Gloucestershire, North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, Mendip, and Wiltshire. Essentially, the function of the green belt is to limit urban sprawl and maintain the open character of areas around the Bristol and Bath built up areas, and nearby towns and villages. The policy is implemented by local planning authorities on the basis of guidance from central government. Geography The land area of the green belt is 66,868 hectares, 0.5% of the total land area of England (2010). Much of the green belt lies within the North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset and South Gloucestershire districts, with smaller areas in the west of Wiltshire, Mendip district and Bristol. Key towns and villages surrounded by or immediately adjoining the green belt include Thornbury, Yate, Chipping Sodbury, Frampton Cotterell, Winterbourne, Coalpit Heath, Keynsham, Bradford on Avon, Trowbridge, Nailsea, Backwell, Portishead, and Clevedon. Bristol Airport is also surrounded by green belt. The green belt includes parts of two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Mendip Hills to the south and the Cotswolds to the east. Responsibility and co-ordination of green belt policy rests with local unitary and district councils as these are the local planning authorities; however the area is largely covered by the West of England Combined Authority which has some responsibilities for the infrastructure of the area. History of the policy The Bristol and Bath Green Belt was first established through the county development plans for Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire. In Somerset, the policy was adopted locally in 1957 and formally, with ministerial approval, in 1966. Subsequently, the County of Avon structure plan adopted in 1985 confirmed the general extent of the green belt, with some variations, and detailed boundaries were reviewed through local plans. In 2002, the draft Joint Structure Plan for the West of England again broadly confirmed the extent of the green belt, and set out the following policy: \\"A Green Belt shall continue to surround and separate Bristol and Bath, and will be kept open in order to: * check the unrestricted sprawl of the Bristol conurbation and Bath; * assist in safeguarding the surrounding countryside from encroachment; * prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another; * preserve the setting and special character of villages, towns and historic cities; and * assist in urban regeneration.\\" West of England Joint Spatial Plan Green Belt Assessment, November 2015. Retrieved 13 January 2018 The policy is subject to further review as part of the West of England Joint Spatial Plan, to be submitted to the UK government in 2018. West of England Joint Spatial Plan. Retrieved 13 January 2018 In 2017, the Centre for Cities called for more houses to be built on the Bristol greenbelt, saying that it was the only way to address the housing crisis in the area. They noted that there were only space for 4,300 homes on brownfield land, whereas the three local councils in the region aim to build 85,000 over the next twenty years.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-39104057 References External links * Interactive map of green belt land Category:Green belts in the United Kingdom Category:Avon (county) Category:Environment of Bristol Category:Environment of Somerset Category:Environment of Gloucestershire ","title":"Avon Green Belt"},{"id":"56160621","text":"Solveig Jülich is a Swedish historian of ideas, professor at the department of History of Science and Ideas at Uppsala University.Solveig Jülich, Department of History of Science and Ideas, Biography.

It does not accept any government funds. Projected external funding for the school is $30 million over the course of 25 years. Christian historian and lawyer David Bercot is on its board, as well as businessmen James W. Bradford and Dr Finny Kuruvilla. Its campus is in a high-rise office building in downtown Boston overlooking the Charles River and Massachusetts State House. Religious Affiliation The college is named for Michael Sattler, a sixteenth-century Anabaptist martyr. While the school is not affiliated with a particular denomination, it espouses principles from the early church and persecuted churches. Sattler believes in the power of redemptive love and emulates the early church and Anabaptist groups by following Jesus's instruction to love our enemies. History In 2015, Dr. Finny Kuruvilla presented his idea of a college with \\"a comprehensive curriculum and beautiful campus overlooking the Boston Harbor... no traditional campus would offer a first-class education for only $9,000 each year.\\" He brought together a board of 6 people including 2 with PhDs from Ivy League schools and 2 with law degrees. In December 2016, Massachusetts Board of Higher Education approved a measure to allow Sattler College to grant degrees and exist as an autonomous institution. Sattler College's first application opened in October 2017 and it began its first semester with students in the fall of 2018. Campus Entrance to 100 Cambridge Street On October 26, 2017, the college announced that it had secured the 17th floor of the Leverett Saltonstall Building for its first campus. It is located in downtown Boston in Beacon Hill. The college says that it had no plans for building science labs. Instead they plan \\"to have students take laboratory courses through the Harvard University Extension School, Northeastern University’s College of Professional Studies, or elsewhere and transfer credits back to Sattler.\\" The college does plan to lease out apartment space to its students to provide housing options. Academics Academic Model Sattler adheres to the Oxford academic model. Classes are mostly discussion-based, with briefer lectures and greater student involvement. They told the Massachusetts BHE, \\"Faculty will serve primarily as mentors and discussion leaders, not as lecturers or providers of information. Students will be directed to on-line lecture sets and will be responsible for learning outside of class, e.g., researching, reading, and watching video lectures. In class, ideas will be reinforced, discussed, and critiqued. Instead of having a library of their own, Sattler utilizes the Boston Public Library for its students. Sattler also provides electronic library resources by subscribing to the eBook services provided by two leading digital library service providers: Proquest (ebrary) and EBSCO.\\" Degree Programs In its December 2016 decision, the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education granted Sattler College the ability to grant the following degrees: * Bachelor of Science in Business * Bachelor of Science in Computer Science * Bachelor of Science in Human Biology * Bachelor of Arts in Biblical and Religious Studies * Bachelor of Arts in History The college has announced that, \\"within ten years [by 2028], we plan to seek authorization to also offer programs in Civil Engineering, English, Education, Journalism, Mathematics, Physics, and Social Sciences.\\" The Three C's One of Sattler College's self-proclaimed distinctives is its focus on \\"The Three C's\\": Core, Christian Character, and Cost. Core Sattler requires an extensive core curriculum based on the liberal arts, including writing, history, biology, math, and economics. Students will also be required to take religion courses on Christianity. These courses include learning Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek, church history, and studying the basics of Christianity. The current campus of Sattler is on the 17th floor of 100 Cambridge Street Sattler's core curriculum courses include: Foundations of Christian Faith * BRS 101 Fundamental Texts of Christianity: The Old and New Testaments * BRS 201 Theology * BRS 203 Apologetics Science * BIO 101 Principles of Biology Mathematics * MAT 102 Statistics and Data Science Humanities (An Integrated Study of History, Literature, and Art) * HUM 102 The History, Literature, and Art of the Ancient and Medieval Worlds * HUM 103 The History, Literature, and Art of the Modern World * HUM 104 The History, Literature, and Art of the United States * HUM 105 The History, Literature, and Art of the Christian Church Social Sciences * BUS 101 Introduction to Economics * SOC 301 Global Poverty: Its Origins and Implications for World Change Language and Communication * LNG 101 Expository Writing and Oral Communication * LNG 102-103 Elementary Biblical Greek I and II * LNG 104-105 Elementary Biblical Hebrew I and II Christian Character Dr. Kuruvilla says that the average student \\"after four years of college, is worse off when it comes to issues like pornography addiction, drug use, cheating and promiscuity.\\" The college says it will focus on growing students \\"as a whole\\" through \\"wise study, mentoring, and discipleship.\\" Cost Sattler College's goal is to keep tuition at $9,000 a year. Sattler College plans on room and board costing around $12,150. Below is their 2016 sample student cost of attendance according to their submission to the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education. {  !Cost of attendance Per year !Live on Campus - Tuition $9,270 - Health Insurance $2,324 - Room and Board: Housing, food, and other services for 9 months  $12,515 - Books and Supplies $618 - Personal Expenses $1,545 - Transportation $278 - Total $26,549 } References External links *Sattler College website Category:Universities and colleges in Boston Category:Private universities and colleges in Massachusetts Category:Nondenominational Christian universities and colleges in the United States Category:Nondenominational Christian universities and colleges ","title":"Sattler College"},{"id":"56160762","text":"Trachyopella is a subgenus of flies belonging to the family of the Lesser Dung flies.

History Albanian-Polish ties date back to the Middle Ages, and in the time of Skanderbeg, the two nations were allied against the Ottoman Empire. The oldest known Polish-Albanian correspondence was a letter from King Wladyslaw to Skanderbeg. In the following centuries, thousands of books were published in Poland about Skanderbeg, and he was recognized as a Christian knight. The two countries share historical commons, such as the bond of Roman Catholicism when Albania's most revered figure, Skanderbeg was a Catholic Albanian who led the fight against Ottoman invasion to Europe, which was recognized by Polish- born Pope John Paul II as a savior; Poland was the first Slavic nation to recognize Kosovo as an independent entity, the relationship between two nations is quite low than expected. Nonetheless, two countries have been working closer since the fall of communism at 1989 and there has been strong renewal of relationship between two nations. Stanislaw Zuber, a mid 20th century Polish geologist, was the author of the first extensive geological map of Albania, which is still in use throughout Albania today. The first telegraph line from North Albania to Istanbul, as well as the first to Manastir, was also constructed by Poles. After Albania split from the Soviet bloc, Albanian-Polish relations came to a halt; after the fall of communism, however, they were resuscitated with considerable contribution by the foundation of the Albanian-Polish Friendship Society, which was created by Albanians who had once studied abroad in Poland. Today, the shared experience of communist rule is a source of shared \\"understanding\\". In 2016, the first economic forum between Poland and Albania was held. On 26 November 2019, an earthquake struck Albania. At the request of the Albanian government, Poland in late December sent 4 firefighter teams to the country and 500 field beds in earthquake aid. Kosovo Kosovo, a region where Albanians formed majority, declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and Poland recognized it on 26 February 2008. While Albania was one of the earliest nations to recognize Kosovo due to common culture, Poland was the first Slavic country to do so. However, in September 2008, President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński, stated that the original cause of the 2008 South Ossetia war was not the Georgian operation, but the recognition of Kosovo's independenceLet's First Help Georgia, Then Talk about Russia and that he would block attempts to establish diplomatic relations of Poland with Kosovo at ambassadorial level; however, the government has not proposed to send an ambassador to Pristina. Nonetheless, Poland had (as of July 2009) 274 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO-led Kosovo Force. Originally there were 800 Polish troops in KFOR.\\"Kosovo Force (KFOR)\\" www.nato.int Link accessed 21-07-09 Cooperation in the Baltic Albanian President 200px In the events following the increased tension resulting from the situation in Ukraine, Albania and Poland have both deployed their soldiers as part of a \\"battle group\\" in Latvia. EU accession Poland is a strong supporter of Albania's accession to the EU. In a bilateral meeting, Jacek Czaputowicz stated that \\"Poland strongly supports Albania’s membership of the EU... We believe that the people of Albania should receive a clear message that the EU is open and awaits Albania, and that this membership would make the EU more culturally rich... We appreciate the Albanian government’s reform efforts; we are happy that they were noticed by the European Commission, whose report last April made an unconditional recommendation for the Council of the European Union to open accession negotiations\\". On May 7, 2018, Czaputowicz stressed the importance of \\"solidarity\\" between Eastern European countries, noting that \\"the Western Balkans are undergoing a similar developmental path as Poland\\" and thus \\"have similar interests\\". On July 5, 2019, Polish head of state Andrzej Duda \\"scolded\\" the EU in a summit as Poznan for delaying membership talks for Albania and North Macedonia, stating \\"The European Union shouldn't treat countries this way when they are carrying out difficult reforms aimed at future integration\\". Economic ties Albania has emerged as a major tourist destination for Poles, with the number of Polish tourists doubling in 2016 to reach 116,000; Poland is in the top 10 sources of foreign tourists in Albania. For the first eleven months of 2018, that number had grown to stand at 152,000.

Diamond Quadrilateral High-speed rail network Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor and Western Dedicated Freight Corridor pass through Haryana.  History  Extent of the Indian railway network in 1909 Haryana railway history =19th Century= On 3 March 1859, Allahabad- Kanpur, the first passenger railway line in North India was opened, which falls under Northern Railway zone. In 1864, train tracks passed through Haryana for the first time when a broad gauge track from Calcutta to Delhi was laid. In 1866, through trains started running on the East Indian Railway Company's Howrah-Delhi line. In 1870, the Sind, Punjab and Delhi railway completed the long Amritsar - Ambala - Jagadhri- Saharanpur - Ghaziabad line connecting Multan (now in Pakistan) with Delhi. In 1872, Sarai Rohilla railway station was established when the metre gauge railway line from Delhi to Jaipur and Ajmer was being laid. It was a small station just outside Delhi as Delhi was confined to walled city then. All the metre gauge trains starting from (and terminating at) Delhi to Rewari, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat passed through this station. The track from Delhi to Sarai Rohilla was double. The single track from Sarai Rohilla to Rewari was doubled up to Rewari, from where single tracks diverged in five directions. In 1876, metre gauge track from Delhi to Rewari and further to Ajmer was laid in 1873 by Rajputana State Railway. In 1879, the Sind, Punjab and Delhi railway completed the Amritsar–Ambala–Saharanpur–Ghaziabad line connecting Multan (now in Pakistan) with Delhi. In 1884, The Rajputana-Malwa Railway extended the wide metre gauge Delhi-Rewari section of Delhi–Fazilka line to Bathinda, which was The Southern Punjab Railway Co. opened the Delhi-Bathinda-Samasatta line in 1897.

The railway line was shifted along Yamuna river and opened in 1924 to make way for the new capital. Minto (now Shivaji) and Hardinge (now Tilak) rail bridges came up for this realigned line. The East Indian Railway Company, that overlooked railways in the region, sanctioned the construction of a single story building and a single platform between Ajmeri Gate and Paharganj in 1926. This was later known as New Delhi Railway station. The government's plans to have the new station built inside the Central Park of Connaught Place was rejected by the Railways as it found the idea impractical.

Along with her parents and sister, she died as a result of a December 2017 traffic collision in southern New South Wales. She appeared posthumously playing the lead role in the 2018 fantasy thriller film Harmony, released 10 months after her death. Biography Falkholt was born on 15 May 1988 in Sydney to a Swedish father and an Italian mother, Lars and Vivian. She attended Gilroy College in Castle Hill, and was awarded the Higher School Certificate in 2006. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Media and Communication at the University of New South Wales, where she starred in several theatrical productions including the musical Cabaret. After graduation, she worked production jobs at Channel Seven and Carnival Films, building a portfolio by acting in television commercials. In 2012, Falkholt was accepted into the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). While studying there, she had minor television roles in Tricky Business and Underbelly: Badness. Falkholt graduated from NIDA in 2015, and the following year took on the recurring role of Hope Morrison in the long-running series Home and Away. In 2017 she completed work on her first feature film, Harmony, released after her death in October 2018, in which she played the titular character. She also filmed a guest role in Nine Network's drama Bite Club. Shortly before the accident, Falkholt finished filming the role of Genevieve in crime drama Mystery Road. Traffic collision On Boxing Day, 26 December 2017, Falkholt was involved in a car crash which killed both her parents instantly. As the vehicle burst into flames, both Jessica and her sister Annabelle, aged 21, were pulled out of the vehicle alive, but Annabelle died on 29 December in Liverpool Hospital. The 50-year-old driver of the other vehicle, who was also killed, was reportedly a serial traffic offender. His car failed to negotiate a curve on the Princes Highway, near Sussex Inlet, and travelled into the path of the Falkholts' car. The Falkholts were returning to Ryde after attending Christmas celebrations. Officials confirmed the other driver was returning home to Ulladulla, after visiting a methadone clinic in Nowra. Police are investigating whether the drug was a factor in the crash, among other contributing factors. Following the crash, Falkholt was taken to Sydney's St George Hospital, where she underwent surgery that included the removal of a kidney and part of her skull. On 12 January 2018, a spokesperson for St George Hospital confirmed that her life support had been turned off. She died in hospital on 17 January 2018, aged 29.

Some of the melodies used by Cerveau can be found in the tunes of Gabriel Bataille and Pierre Guédron - we don't know if they were borrowings or whether both have drawn from a common source. Cerveau explains in the preface of his arias that, \\"according to the most doctrinal musicians\\", there are two ways to perform his arias \\"either with voices simply without an instrument, or with instruments married to the voice.\\" (which, by emphasizing the superior voice, underlines the aria character of these pieces) Cerveau's arias can still be found in some later collections: *One aria in Airs nouveaux et chansons à danser...

The second set of page table for use in user mode contains a copy of user-space and a minimal set of kernel-space handling system calls and interrupts. Kernel page-table isolation (KPTI or PTI, previously called KAISER) is a Linux kernel feature that mitigates the Meltdown security vulnerability (affecting mainly Intel's x86 CPUs) and improves kernel hardening against attempts to bypass kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR). It works by better isolating user space and kernel space memory. KPTI was merged into Linux kernel version 4.15, and backported to Linux kernels 4.14.11, 4.9.75, and 4.4.110. Windows and macOS released similar updates. KPTI does not address the related Spectre vulnerability.  Background on KAISER  The KPTI patches were based on KAISER (short for Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Efficiently Removed), a technique conceived in 2016 and published in June 2017 back when Meltdown was not known yet. KAISER makes it harder to defeat KASLR, a 2014 mitigation for a much less severe issue. In 2014, the Linux kernel adopted kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR), which makes it more difficult to exploit other kernel vulnerabilities, which relies on kernel address mappings remaining hidden from user space. Despite prohibiting access to these kernel mappings, it turns out that there are several side-channel attacks in modern processors that can leak the location of this memory, making it possible to work around KASLR. KAISER addressed these problems in KASLR by eliminating some sources of address leakage. Whereas KASLR merely prevents address mappings from leaking, KAISER also prevents the data from leaking, thereby covering the Meltdown case. KPTI is based on KAISER. Without KPTI enabled, whenever executing user-space code (applications), Linux would also keep its entire kernel memory mapped in page tables, although protected from access. The advantage is that when the application makes a system call into the kernel or an interrupt is received, kernel page tables are always present, so most context switching-related overheads (TLB flush, page-table swapping, etc) can be avoided.  Meltdown vulnerability and KPTI  In January 2018, the Meltdown vulnerability was published, known to affect Intel's x86 CPUs and ARM Cortex-A75. It was a far more severe vulnerability than the KASLR bypass that KAISER originally intended to fix: It was found that contents of kernel memory could also be leaked, not just the locations of memory mappings, as previously thought. KPTI (conceptually based on KAISER) prevents Meltdown by preventing most protected locations from being mapped to user space. AMD x86 processors are not currently known to be affected by Meltdown and don't need KPTI to mitigate them. However, AMD processors are still susceptible to KASLR bypass when KPTI is disabled.  Implementation  KPTI fixes these leaks by separating user- space and kernel-space page tables entirely. One set of page tables includes both kernel-space and user-space addresses same as before, but it is only used when the system is running in kernel mode. The second set of page tables for use in user mode contains a copy of user-space and a minimal set of kernel- space mappings that provides the information needed to enter or exit system calls, interrupts and exceptions. On processors that support the process- context identifiers (PCID), a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) flush can be avoided, but even then it comes at a significant performance cost, particularly in syscall-heavy and interrupt-heavy workloads. The overhead was measured to be 0.28% according to KAISER's original authors; a Linux developer measured it to be roughly 5% for most workloads and up to 30% in some cases, even with the PCID optimization; for database engine PostgreSQL the impact on read-only tests on an Intel Skylake processor was 7–17% (or 16–23% without PCID), while a full benchmark lost 13–19% (Coffee Lake vs. Broadwell-E). Many benchmarks have been done by Phoronix, Redis slowed by 6–7%. Linux kernel compilation slowed down by 5% on Haswell. KPTI can partially be disabled with the \\"nopti\\" kernel boot option. Also provisions were created to disable KPTI if newer processors fix the information leaks.

Domingo de Guzman, the founder of the Order of Preachers or the Dominican Order. As such, Abucay is considered to be the second oldest parish administered by the Dominicans in the Philippines, having been founded immediately after the establishment of the Dominican motherhouse of Sto. Domingo in Manila. The Dominican frailes brought with them the miraculous image of Nuestra Señora del Rosario, a custom followed by the Dominican Order in all of their new missions in keeping with their calling to promote the devotion to the Holy Rosary. Orani prospered as a town and its population subsequently increased. Alongside this development, the devotion to the Virgin of the Rosary grew so fast that at that time, she was already being called \\"la Virgen Milagrosa\\" or the Miraculous Virgin, due to her numerous miracles which drew thousands of pilgrims from nearby provinces such as Bulacan, Pampanga and Zamabales. This exponential growth eventually led to the establishment of Orani as an independent parish or Vicaría on April 21, 1714. A life-sized image measuring one \\"estadio\\" or 1.68 m, the image of the Virgen Milagrosa is a traditional Baroque rendition of the Mother and Child, in particular, that of our Lady of the Rosary. The statue is made out of wood, fully sculpted in the round, including the clothes, although she is dressed with real vestments donated by her devotees, following a tradition of vesting images of saints in Spain and the New World that continues to this day. The Virgin carries the Child Jesus with her left arm and, instead of the usual Rosary in the right arm, she holds a cane or walking stick (bastón) as well as a scepter, while a Rosary hangs around her neck. The Christ Child holds a globe in His left hand while extending His right arm in a blessing. Rosaries hang from the necks of both Mother and Child following the way the Spanish Dominican missionaries wore the rosary and following a custom of the faithful in Spain and her colonies at the time, in order to gain special indulgences. She is garbed with a blue mantle that extends from her back and is tucked in her waist, and wears a white robe that was originally red but was repainted at a later date. A white veil covers her head in the manner of Jewish women at the time of Jesus. Considering its large size, the image could be considered rare for that time. Some historians opine that it was intentionally made big to commemorate an important event or milestone, such as the founding of the Dominican mission in Bataan, the first outside Manila for the Dominicans. The size could also indicate that the image was meant to be enshrined at a church altar, hence its dimensions. As to the origin of the image of the Virgen Milagrosa, there are some theories which claim that the statue originated from Spain (on board the galleons that transported soldiers and the frailes from Spain to the New World). Nevertheless, considering the length and difficulty of the voyage from the Mother Country to the Philippines, as well as the precious space on board the galleons, bringing an image so large would simply have been impractical. Another theory states that it came from Mexico, just like the image of La Naval de Manila, whose presence during the Dominicans missionaries' first voyage to the Philippines in 1587 was recorded by the frailes. The fact that the Orani image was not mentioned at all is highly indicative that it was not on the same journey. Claims that it came on a later journey, however, would clash with accounts by the Dominicans that it was brought to Bataan in 1587. Still, others claim that it was made in the Philippines, sometime between July 1587 and June 1588, just in time for the formal establishment of the Parish of Abucay. An analysis of the technique and rendition of the image's features may indicate a Philippine provenance. Elements such as the suksok (a carved and stylistic rendition of the mantle, tucked into the waist at the back) confirms this theory, aside from the features on the Virgin's face. Furthermore, at that time, there were already many able artisans (mostly Chinese) in Manila and its environs who could carve religious images after being taught by the religious orders that arrived first in the Philippines. The abundance of talented sculptors was noted by the Dominican Bishop of Manila (the first in the country), Domingo de Salazar, when he wrote King Philip II of Spain in 1590. Most of these artisans were Sangleys (Chinese) living in the Parián, an enclave of Manila also administered by the Dominicans. On December 11, 1965, an article written by Oscar R. Landicho was published in the Chronicle magazine claiming that the Virgen Milagrosa was made by a \\"Greek\\" slave named Pere Morey in 1360. According to the article, Pere Morey was the father of Pere Oller and Pere Johan. To set the record straight, Pere Morey was not from Greece but was a subject of the Kingdom of Aragón (which would later become the Kingdom of Spain after its unification with the Kingdom of Castille in the 15th century). Morey was active in the island of Mallorca (then part of the Kingdom of Aragón) as a master mason (stonecutter)as well as an architect, and worked in the construction of various churches. Secondly, he was not related to Pere Oller and Pere Johan who were Gothic-style sculptors in the region of Catalunya. The writer may have been misled by the common name Pere (Pedro) which was not a surname or a family name but rather a first name. Pere Morey himself lived during the Gothic period of architecture and sculpture in Europe so to attribute to him a Baroque image like the Virgen Milagrosa of Orani would be something hard, if not impossible, to explain. Even in the remotest chance that the Virgen Milagrosa of Orani was made in 1360, it would be highly improbable that its devotees would have allowed the Dominican missionaries to take away to a distant land an image that would already have been more than 200 years old at that time (in the 1580s). Pere Morey is not to be confused with Pere Morey Servera, an award-winning Catalan writer born in 1941 and who is still active to this day. Miracles Holy Mass (Orani Church Sanctuary, a blue orb is photographed beside the Santo Niño) In 1596, the Dominican friars established the \\"visita\\" of Samal, under the parish of Abucay and transferred the image thereto. According to oral tradition, shortly after Samal was established as a Parish on April 20, 1644, the statue disappeared from its altar and was later found under a camachile tree near a creek, some 5 kilometers north of Samal. The people of Samal tried to return the image to their church but the same phenomenon occurred three times: the image returned to the same camachile tree where it had been found. The people interpreted this strange occurrence as a sign of God's will that the image should remain in Orani, so a small \\"visita\\" was built on that very spot. In the Battles of La Naval de Manila from 1646 to 1647 against the Protestant Netherlands (that vied with Catholic Spain for colonial supremacy in the Orient), the Dutch invaders took Corregidor and plundered the coast of Bataan but Kapamgpangan and Orani natives under the protection of the Virgin of Orani defeated the Dutch forces who reached their shores. The Dutch marauders who succeeded in plundering Abucay, were also struck by a plague, and were forced to return to Batavia (modern-day Indonesia). Even in the early years of the Dominicans in Bataan, the new converts already looked up to her as their “protector and guide” and “implored her with love and a lively faith in all their tribulations in life.” Many miracles were wrought through her intercession and were fortunately recorded by the Dominicans as a proof of her fame as a “miracle-worker.” One account speaks of the mysterious retreat of aggressive aetas who had sought to destroy the town, which was then a village of Samal. Pertinent investigations later showed that a heavenly Matron with a “stern countenance” appeared to the assaulting tribesmen and drove them off. The consensus was that this lady was the Virgin. There is also the story of a locust plague in 1718 that, for some odd reason, spared only the province of Bataan. Despite the parish priest’s plea for the people to take measures against the plague, the only thing that the townspeople did was to pray at the Virgin’s shrine and their prayers were not in vain. A strong wind blew away the swarm of insects into the sea. Also famous is the case of a judge from Manila, D. Gregorio de la Villa, who, being gravely ill, sought the Virgin’s help to cure the malady that left him almost totally paralyzed. Even before finishing the novena to the Virgen Milagrosa - he was already up and about and in the pink of health. Just as renowned is the case of a young boy from Bagbag (present-day Novaliches) who died. During his wake, his bereaved mother pleaded to the Virgen Milagrosa del Rosario and sought her maternal compassion. To the surprise of those present, the dead boy stood up and walked to his mother. In gratitude, both mother and child made a pilgrimage to Orani where they relayed what had happened to them to the Parish Priest who confirmed the authenticity of the miracle. Also healed after praying the novena to the Virgen Milagrosa was a leper from Catanggalan (present-day Obando, Bulacan) whose healing over the nine days of the novena was witnessed by the Parish priest and by the faithful of Orani. The same Dominicans who recorded these miracles were wise to point out that as a result of these miracles, the devotion to the Virgin of Orani had enjoyed a “growing progression” and that “several volumes would be necessary to narrate the favors and that God has given though her.” In return, the grateful people of Orani, would bring herbs and flowers to adorn her altar, as well as oil to fuel her lamp. The flowers and herbs and even the oil were later deemed miraculous by the people, just like the waters that sprung from the Virgin’s fountain, which was erected by the townspeople near the port, in her honor. The rich citizens of Orani and Samal, as well as some officials from as far away as Binondo, would donate jewels to her, as recorded in a 1750 inventory of her trousseau. On the other hand, the simple peasants of Orani would dance the “Jota de Orani” at the entrance of the church, as a token of gratitude for bountiful harvests. The shrine would also become the “most beautiful church in the province” and its reconstruction after the many fires and earthquakes that destroyed the building in the 19th and 20th century never lacked funds thanks to the piety and generosity of the people of Bataan and its neighboring provinces. This piety and generosity was proven during the great fire of March 16, 1938, which destroyed three fourths of Orani. During the fire, the image was partially damaged but was not totally burned. It was later repaired in the bahay kastila owned by the Salaverria family (the matriarch, Filomena Pascual de Salaverria was the image's camarera) located just beside the church. The Blessed Sacrament also escaped the conflagration and was found miraculously intact after the fire. The church, despite the hardships the people of Orani endured, was rebuilt in a short time thanks to the people's devotion to their patroness. During World War II, according to the accounts of Luling Casimiro, one of the seamstresses of the image, a Japanese soldier arrogantly aimed his gun at the statue, but scampered away in fright after the magazine of his gun melted and bent right before his very eyes. When most of Luzon's seawaters were hit by the Red Tide in the 1990s, Orani's fishermen prayed to the Virgen Milagrosa for help, and Orani's fishing waters were mysteriously spared. To the surprise of the image's caretakers, the hemline of the Virgen's dress was found wet and muddied as though she had gone out to the coast to banish away the red tide. After the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, citizens of Porac, Pampanga came to Orani during the town fiesta to give thanks, claiming that the Sto. Rosario of Orani had appeared to them in their dreams telling them to flee to higher grounds to escape the onslaught of lahar. At about the time the lahar had flowed, caretakers of the image found that the Virgen's saya was wet and soiled with lahar as if the Virgin had travelled to Pampanga to come to the aid of her devotees. Veneration In recognition of the widespread devotion to the Virgen Milagrosa of Orani, Pope Pius XII approved on October 7, 1958 the Canonical Coronation of the image. The actual coronation would take place on April 18, 1959 in a solemn ceremony led by the Archbishop of San Fernando, Emilio Cinense, and the Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Salvatore Sino. In 1965, six years after the Canonical Coronation of the Virgen Milagrosa, Mr. Joaquin Mayoralgo, a native of Orani, approached then Parish Priest, Msgr. Emiliano Santos, claiming that he had the \\"original\\" image of the Virgen (i.e., the one that was brought by the Spaniards to Bataan) in his possession.\\"Lambong\\" by Joel Alexander S. de Leon When asked by Msgr. Santos how the image came into his possession, Mr. Mayoralgo claimed that he bought the image in an antique shop in Manila that had allegedly acquired it from an American G.I. who, in turn, supposedly found it floating in a river in Cavite in the 1940s. According to the claim, the G.I. was returning to the United States so he decided to get money to finance his trip by selling the image to the antique shop. Mr. Mayoralgo wanted the Monsignor to exchange the image he bought from the antique shop for the canonically crowned Image enshrined in the Parish Church, which he wanted to bring home. Msgr. Santos refused to surrender the image in Church to Mr. Mayoralgo, defending its antiquity and authenticity, but in order to appease Mr. Mayoralgo, allowed him to use this 1965 image as the official replica of the one enshrined at church. Mr. Mayoralgo decided to crown his image in 1965 (using the 1959 coronation regalia) and have a chapel built in the barrio of Silahis to enshrine his image, which he continued to claim as the original. He also had a novena (without the required Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur) printed and distributed, wherein he expressed the same claims. To date, the Diocese has not and does not recognize his claims while maintaining the authenticity of the Canonically Crowned Image in the Parish Church. The Diocese, however, allows the veneration of the image of Silahis in its chapel as an expression of the people's piety towards the Virgin. On April 18, 1984, Cardinal Jaime Sin led the celebrations for the 25th Anniversary of the Canonical Coronation. The 50th or Golden Anniversary of the Canonical Coronation was also celebrated with the presence of Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales in 2009. The feast of the Virgen Milagrosa de Orani is celebrated by hundreds of thousands of devotees from all parts of Luzon, who flock to her shrine every second Sunday of October. At the shrine, the pilgrims pray the Rosary, hear Mass, receive Holy Communion and kiss the mantle of the Virgin at the back of the church. The town fiesta of Orani is considered by many as the most lively and joyous in Bataan, and even the whole of Central Luzon, due to the huge number of pilgrims who travel starting on the first day of the novena till the feast day itself. Throughout the town, marching bands can seen and heard, while stalls selling different products - from food to toys and clothing - line the plaza, the church area as well as main thoroughfares. On the feast day itself, Masses are celebrated every hour from 3:00 a.m. till 9:00 p.m. and all of these Masses are always brimming with people. Busloads of pilgrims from all over the country also visit her shrine throughout the year, usually on weekends. The Second Saturday of every month has been declared as the official pilgrimage day to Shrine. Devotees who fulfill the conditions of confession, communion and prayer for the Pope's intentions may gain a Plenary Indulgence on August 5, on the major feast days of the Virgin Mary or on a day of their choice once a year. This is in virtue of the Shrine's inscription as Spiritual Affiliate of the Archbasilica of St. Mary Major in Rome in September 2012.

Garner became involved in activism following the 2014 death of her father, Eric Garner, after a New York City police officer placed him in a lethal chokehold during an arrest.  Early life  Erica Garner, born on May 29, 1990 at Woodhull Hospital, was the daughter of Esaw Garner Snipes and Eric Garner, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. She was the oldest of four children born to Eric and Esaw. Esaw had two older children from a previous relationship. As Eric's asthma and other health problems made it difficult for him to work, he played a large role at home in raising the children. When Garner was fourteen, her turbulent relationship with her mother deteriorated to the point that Esaw voluntarily placed her into foster care. Garner was placed with the Goode family in Far Rockaway, Queens. The family offered to adopt Garner; the adoption fell through, but Garner stayed with the family and they maintained a close relationship even after she became an adult.  Activism  Garner became involved in activism in 2014 after her father died during the NYPD's attempt to arrest him for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, and she remained a critic of the NYPD up to her death. Beginning a month after his death and for the following year, Garner led twice-weekly marches visiting the scene of her father's death, visits which the media labeled a \\"die-in\\". She also marched in Black Lives Matter demonstrations and other protest events, and set up a foundation in her father's name. The aim of the foundation, named the Garner Way Foundation, is to \\"engage communities all over the world in social justice issues through political awareness, music, arts and activism.\\" In addition, Garner campaigned to have the transcripts of the grand jury into her father's death made public. Garner stated that she believed her father's death had more to do with police misconduct than race, and in 2017, she rejected a meeting with the United States Justice Department to discuss the circumstances surrounding her father's death. During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Garner supported Bernie Sanders, and appeared in an advertisement for him as well as on the campaign trail. Personal life and death Garner had two children. Shortly after the birth of her son Eric, named after her father, in August 2017, she suffered a heart attack. Doctors subsequently found that her heart was enlarged. On December 23, 2017, she suffered a second heart attack, after which she fell into a coma. She was left with \\"major brain damage,\\" leading to her death on December 30, 2017. She died at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn surrounded by her family and foster family. On the news of her death, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would \\"miss her unshakable sense of justice and passion for humanity\\", despite the fact that Garner had been a frequent critic of de Blasio during her lifetime. The New York Civil Liberties Union issued a statement saying that Garner \\"showed incredible courage and remarkable resolve\\" and \\"bravely transformed her unspeakable personal pain in[to] political power as she became a leader in the fight for police reform\\". The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) also issued a statement acknowledging her leadership and strength. Fellow activist DeRay Mckesson said, “Erica took the truth with her everywhere she went, even if that truth made people uncomfortable\\". Tweets were subsequently posted from Garner's official Twitter account demanding that de Blasio \\"explain how she died with no justice\\" and requesting that \\"out of respect to Erica please do not request comment if the journalist is not Black\\". These tweets were later found to have been posted by Garner's publicist.

Repressive actions were organised by state services, party militias and hybrid structures. Some activities were carried out as part of legal procedures and might have involved various judiciary, but others remained on the verge of legal framework or clearly beyond it. Legally-sanctioned repressive actions included execution, expropriations, fines, dismissal, jail, relocation, forced labour or loss of civil rights. Extrajudicial violence included execution, rape, mutilation, torture, humiliation, incarceration, destruction or the takeover of property. The climax of repressions took place in 1936, but they continued also during the following years. Their total scale remains unclear; fragmentary figures indicate that one institution detained at least 18,000 people in 1936. The number of the executed is disputed; two personal lists produced contain around 9,000 and around 11,500 names. Historians do not agree on most issues related to the Civil War repressions, including the ones of Madrid in 1936-1939. Organization framework At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War there were three policing formations operational in Madrid, all reporting to Minister of Interior: Guardia Civil, Guardia de Asalto and the police. Guardia Civil was initially targeted for major purge and reform,Gerald Blaney Jr., La historiografía sobre la Guardia Civil. Crítica y propuestas de investigación, [in:] Politica y sociedad 42/3 (2005), pp. 31–44 but in late August 1936 it was declared to be dissolved and replaced by a new service, Guardia Nacional Republicana (GNR). Recruitment to GNR commenced soon, yet the Guard did not play major role in implementation of repressive measures; starting late 1936 it was already marked for merger into a new general public order formation.Julius Ruiz, The ‘Red Terror’ and the Spanish Civil War. Revolutionary violence in Madrid, Cambridge 2014, , pp. 86–87 Guardia de Asalto continued to operate, yet its Madrid units were deployed on the front against the rebels and were scarcely involved in the city. The police, and especially its investigative branch Cuerpo de Investigación y Vigilancia (CIV), from the onset underwent major change. Supervised by Dirección General de Seguridad (DSG), a security office within the Ministry of Interior, the change consisted of massive purges on one hand and massive new recruitment on the other.following 1936 purges the CIV was only in 26% composed of former policemen; 30% were industry workers and 24% service workers, Ruiz 2014, p. 90 Staffed with new militant members coming from revolutionary parties, some CIV units like Brigada Atadell, Brigada de Amanacer or Los Linces de la República became instrumental in implementing the Republican order.Ruiz 2014, pp. 92–98 Outbreak of hostilities and especially the decision to hand weapons to civilians, mostly party and trade union members, produced rapid emergence of armed militias, usually though not always affiliated to political organizations.Sara Izquierdo Alvarez, Las checas del Madrid Republicano: un ejemplo de investigación interdisciplinar, [in:] Aportes' 79 (2012), p. 79 During first months of the war they by far eclipsed state formations in terms of shaping the public order ambience in Madrid, yet due to their makeshift organization, ephemeral nature and improvised modus operandi this vast force evades systematic structural description. These groups are best known because of detention and interrogation posts operated, commonly known as checas;the name was then applied to all detention posts, also these operated by state police their number is currently calculated at around 350,there were 276 checas in the very city and 64 in its immediate vicinity, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, pp. 82, 86 some 4 per every square kilometer and one per every 3,000 people;Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 85 the majority disappeared by early 1937.Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, pp. 79–80. Most of the checas were abandoned in November, when the Nationalist troops were approaching the city, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 88 Though there are rare accounts of conflict between militias and official public order units,see e.g. there is an account of a police detachment preventing execution of religious from raided convent, Ruiz 2014, p. 71 in general the latter avoided challenging the former. Both developed sort of operational symbiosis, e.g. militias used official police records to identify and locate suspects, at times handed over detainees to DSG or – far more frequently – took them over from prisons, arrests or police stations. It is suspected that on exception basis frontline military units might have also participated in action against presumed anti-Republican conspiracy.this is the case of 36. Brigada Mixta, believed to be involved in a scam known as Túnel de Usera in October 1937 In August 1936 the DSG in agreement with major parties decided to set up a new body, Comité Provincial de Investigación Pública (CPIP).Fernando Jiménez Herrera, El Comité Provincial de Investigación Pública a través de la documentación custoriada en el archivo general militar de Madrid, [in:] Hispania Nova 12 (2014), p. 5 [sequential page, there is no original pagination] A paid policing serviceJiménez Herrera 2014, p.8 managed by a board consisting of party delegates,Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 5. Detailed social analysis of members of public order structures is not available. In case of CPIP all were males, mostly between 25 and 45 years. Usually they were former service employees with many industry men as well; there were also single writers, periodistas, teachers, or painters, Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 28 CPIP was to thwart anti-Republican plots and to arrest individuals involved. In theory they were to be passed to DSG for further investigation; in practice CPIP's internal filtering body, set up to process detainees, was entitled to administer executions.Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 17, Ruiz 2014, pp. 263-266. It is not clear whether CPIP and its filtering bodies, named \\"tribunales\\", should be considered part of the police system or part of the judiciary. CPIP was set up by Ministry of Interior and was subordinate to its office DSG, not to Ministry of Justice During some 100 days of its existence CPIP was the key law-enforcement agency before a dissolution decree was issued early November 1936,Jiménez Herrera 2014, p.18 though few units continued to operate some time afterwards.Jiménez Herrera 2014, pp. 23-25 Another new body, by far less important, was Inspección General de Milicias (IGM).at one point there were 1,004 men employed in IGM, Ruiz 2014, p. 101 Created also in August 1936 it was an army branch, supposed to co-ordinate logistics and financing of party militias, though it operated also its own Sección de Investigación; IGM was dissolved in November 1936.Ruiz 2014, p. 101 In September 1936 Ministry of Interior set up its own unit designed to co- ordinate militia activities, Milicias de Vigilancia de la Retaguardia (MVR), a hybrid between state policing force and party militias; initially scarcely active, later MVR recruited men from dissolved CPIPexact reason for dissolution of CPIP is not clear and all related theories are speculative, Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 10 and gained momentum; some of its sections became very active before MVR, including the militia units still operational, was dissolved in December 1936.at one point there were 1,378 men registered in MVR, Ruiz 2014, pp. 180-182, 268 In December 1936 it was made public that all policing formations - Guardia de Asalto, GNR, CIV, MVR, IGM – would merge in a new service, Cuerpo de Seguridad (CS). Of its two branches, Grupo Uniformado and Grupo Civil, the latter included Sección de Investigaciones Especiales; this plain clothes investigation service became the backbone of policing structures managed by the Ministry of Interior.Ruiz 2014, pp. 294-295 However, the same minister in June 1937 carved out from DSG a unit named Departamento Especial de Información de Estado (DEDIDE), basically a counter-intelligence agency, which also in Madrid ran its own network of operatives and premises.Ruiz 2014, p. 321 Two months later, in August 1937, the Ministry of War declared setting up a new organization, supposed to gather all espionage, counter-espionage and information activities: Servicio de Investigación Militar (SIM).Ruiz 2014, p. 298 From that moment onwards SIM became the key state instrument in fighting presumed conspiracy. In March 1938 it incorporated the dissolved DEDIDE.Ruiz 2014, p. 322 The army intelligence units like Section Two of the General Staff, later known as Servicio de Información del Estado Mayor (SIEM), continued to operate independently,Ruiz 2014, p. 285 yet except late 1936/early 1937, when military counter-espionage Special Services remained fairly active, they did not contribute to public order system in Madrid.for organigram see Javier Cervera, Madrid en guerra, Madrid 1998, , p. 428 Modus operandi Units forming the Republican realm of public order relied on various methods in their pursuit of suspects.brief discussion of modus operandi in Cervera 1998, pp. 60-68; discussion of who could have been considered a suspect Cervera 1998, pp. 130-148 The most popular one was response to tips and denunciations, either from individuals co-operating with the security, most prominently porters of the UGT union of porters, or madrileños who were not related to the policing network. Another method was the systematic search, usually based on files held by prewar offices like police departments, or papers obtained from raiding premises of right-wing parties or institutions.Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 79 One more method was street vigilance and monitoring, related to key objects or the black market. Finally, certain units specialized in setting up traps, like the false embassy of Siam or the so-called Túnel de Usera.process flow graph with organigram in Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 89, see also annexes in Ruiz 2014 Some individuals were apprehendedmost (79.8%) were apprehended in late evening, Javier Cervera Gil, Violencia en el Madrid de la Guerra Civil: los ‘paseos’ (julio a diciembre de 1936), [in:] Studia Historica Contemporanea 13-14 (1995-1996), p. 76 and executed on the spot or shortly afterwards, at times maltreated before death.bodies were at times found with various types of injuries, see e.g. Ruiz 2014, p. 79 Many of them, however, ended up in some sort of incarceration; it might have been in official prison compounds, in arrests on police stations or in detention centers operated by various groups, usually in former convents or other suitable large buildings.Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 85 It seems that incarceration usually lasted no longer than few months, but there were cases of much longer detention.e.g. an individual arrested in July 1936 was kept behind bars until June 1937, when he finally faced the tribunal, Ruiz 2014, p. 59. Another one, arrested in October 1936, perished in a SIM labor camp in December 1938, Julius Ruiz, Work and Don't Lose Hope': Republican Forced Labour Camps during the Spanish Civil War, [in:] Contemporary European History 18/4 (2009), p. 437 An interrogation followed; depending upon the results of questioning, the detainees might have been set free, transferred to another detention unit, e.g. from CPIP to DSG,Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 79, Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 6 left in custody, marked to stand before a tribunal or selected for execution.Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 17 There is no reliable statistics available; according to members of CPIP filtering commissionit was named \\"tribunal\\" and worked in three shifts to ensure around the clock proceedings; each sitting was attended by three tribunal members and their decision had to be unanimous; hearings lasted some 20 minutes, Jiménez Herrera 2014, pp. 14–18 interrogated by their Nationalist captors after 1939, some 50% of captives were freed, some 25% were marked for further incarceration and some 25% were executed. Suspects supposed to stand trial might have faced different types of judicial or quasi-judicial bodies.detailed analysis in Javier Cervera Gil, Contra el enemigo de la República... desde la ley, Madrid 2015, ; organigrams of justice system on various stages of organisation in Cervera 1998, pp. 425, 427, 429–430 Regular system of district courts continued to operate,Ruiz 2014, p. 174 but it could not cope with the scale of detentions. In August 1936, the government set up Tribunal Especial dedicated exclusively to dealing with crimes of \\"rebellion and sedition\\";Historia institucional, [in:] Portal de Archivos Españoles, available here in September 1936 it was aided by a new type of judicial body, Tribunal Popular de Responsabilidades Civiles, and in October of the same year by Jurados de UrgenciaRuiz 2014, p. 179 and Jurados de Guardia,Ruiz 2014, p. 180, it might be interesting to note that about the same time, in November 1936, also the Nationalists set up their judicial structures to dispense justice in Madrid. They consisted of eight military tribunals, sixteen examining magistrates and the Auditoria del Ejercito de Ocupación, BOE 05.11.1936. both abolished in March 1938;Cervera Gil 2015, pp. 126–149 it was not the case of Tribunal Especial de Espionaje y Alta Traición, set up in June 1937.Cervera Gil 2015, pp. 175-185 Most of these tribunals had a mixed composition of professional judges/lawyers and non-professional jury members recruited from the public; they admitted, at least in theory, various degree of defense or self-defense, but there was no appeal. The tribunals were created to dispense fast and smooth justice but failed to do so; e.g. there were only 389 defendants who appeared before the Madrid Tribunal Especial in 1936.the death sentence was by no means default. There were cases of popular tribunals engaging into detailed examination; a man charged with sniping in October 1936 and trialed in mid-1937 was acquitted following opinion of experts, who inspected the place of alleged crime and found that it physically was not possible for the man to have engaged in sniping, Ruiz 2014, p. 59 There is only partial statistics of verdicts adopted;for an attempt of the summary see Cervera Gil 2015, pp. 223–231 it seems that around 50% of defendants were absolvedCervera 1998, pp. 153–155; 53% of workers and 44% of middle-class defendants were acquitted, Cervera 1998, p. 152 and that some 8% were sentenced to capital punishment.45 death sentences of out 566 cases produced by one tribunal, Santos Juliá Díaz (ed.), Victimas de la guerra civil, Madrid 1999, , p. 164 Perhaps the best known case of Madrid execution following trial and death sentence is this of Joaquín Fanjul. Executions might have taken place during or shortly after the apprehension, during incarceration in prison/detention centre or at one of execution sites, the latter following less or more formal administrative/juridical decision or resulting from action unsanctioned even by a dubious procedure.vast majority of the killings took place in the early morning hours, Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76 There is no systematic data allowing quantitative estimates, but it is believed that the number of on-the-spot executions was highest during initial months of the war and decreased rapidly afterwards.Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76 The best-known form of killings were so-called paseosdetailed discussion in Javier Cervera, Madrid en guerra, Madrid 1998, , pp. 68-71 and sacas.Cervera 1998, pp. 84–102 The former usually stands for small-scale unofficial executions, while the latter typically denotes larger extractions of inmates from detention sites, often substantiated by some form of formal decision. In both cases, inmates were shot in sparsely-populated quarters, typically in parks or near cemeteries. Corpses were then dumped at the nearest cemetery or left to be collected by municipal services later, but in the largest case of Paracuellos de Jarama, they were buried in shallow common graves. In late 1937, inmates were increasingly directed to labour camps, typically operated by SIM.though they could have been operated by also DEDIDE or directly by DSG; Cervera Gil 2015, pp. 214–222, Ruiz 2009, pp. 419–441 They were not comparable to later Nazi death camps, but some inmates perished in atrocious conditions; the Madrid Province had such a camp was in Ambite.Ruiz 2014, pp. 313–323 Victims Ramiro Maeztu None of the sources consulted suggests how many Madrid residents might have been subject to repression during the Civil War. All estimates focus on the executed but do not advance figures related to other categories of the repressed, be it those related to legal proceedings – expropriated, fined, dismissed, jailed, relocated, condemned to forced labor, stripped of civil rights – or those related to extrajudicial violence, like those raped, mutilated, beaten, tortured, humiliated, detained or those who found their property vandalized, stolen, burnt or otherwise destroyed. One study suggests that the number of CPIP detainees only might have been 18,000.Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 12 Initially the number of executed was counted in tens of thousands, e.g. in early 1937 The Guardian coined the figure of 40,000.Ruiz 2014, p. 3 The Francoist Dictamen, released in 1939, opted for 60,000, though confidentially the numbers were soon reduced to 18,000.Ruiz 2014, pp. 3-4 Until the end of Francoism it was impossible to verify these claims; archival research of the late 20th century produced two lists of identified victims, one totaling 8,815Rafael Casas de la Vega, El Terror. Madrid 1936, Toledo 1994, and one 11,756.Cesar Vidal, Checas de Madrid, Barcelona 2004, Both lists have been proven to be defective; on one hand, they contain duplicated names, and on the other, there are individuals known to have been arrested and never re-appearing, but missing among the names. Most scholars tend to prefer the 8,815 figure as a general approximation,see e.g. José Luis Ledesma, Una retaguardia al rojo: lasviolencias en la zona republicana, [in:] Francisco Espinosa Maestre (ed.), Violencia roja y azul: España, 1936–1950, Barcelona 2010, 9788498921168 pp. 247, 409, Mirta Núñez Díaz-Balart (ed.), La gran represión: los años de plomo del franquismo, Barcelona 2009, , p. 443, Ruiz 2014, p. 4, Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939, London 2006, , p. 87; others offer close estimates, e.g. \\"perhaps as many as 10,000\\", Stanley G. Payne, The Spanish Civil War, Cambridge 2012, , p. 108 though few authors claim that given only identified victims are listed, the overall death toll in the province was around 15,000.16,000 according to Vidal, see e.g. ABC 18.08.2013, available here, or 14,898 according to Ángel David Martín Rubio, Los Mitos de la Represión en la Guerra Civil, Madrid 2005, , p. 82. Some historians, like Luis Togores, note 20,000 dead in Madrid, compare YouTube footage (19:41) Even the lowest estimate of 8,815 places Madrid among provinces with the highest relative repression level in the loyalist area;out of 22 provinces with research into detailed number of victims either completed or advanced in 1999, the total number of those killed in the rearguard of the Republican zone was estimated at 37,843 victims, Julia 1999, p. 412, though some estimates for all the Republic-held territory claim 56,000 executions, Payne 2012, p. 110. The province identified as the one with the most severe repression in proportion to overall population was Zaragoza, subject to the Nationalist terror, Stanley G. Payne, Civil War in Europe, Cambridge 2011, , p. 153 in absolute terms there is no question that Madrid \\"witnessed the most killings in the Republican zone\\".Francisco Espinosa (ed.), Violencia roja y azul. España 1936-1939, Barcelona 2010, , p. 409 There is no systematic documentation on the repressed which would allow any reasonable social profiling. Existing sets of more thorough data refer to specific processes and it is not clear how representative they are; this is e.g. the case of files produced by popular tribunals. Some scholars tend to accept them as indicative of general social composition of all the repressed,see the analysis in Cervera 1998 though e.g. in case of sex there are significant discrepancies noted.Popular tribunal data indicate that females formed 26% of the defendants (Cervera 1998, p. 171), while on lists of those killed during paseos the females make up 7% (Ruiz 2014, p. 4). The discrepancy gives rise to a hypothesis that detained women were more likely than men to evade execution and enjoyed far greater chance to be delivered for orderly trial, which in turn might render the tribunal data scarcely representative. According to the tribunal files most of the defendants were empleados, a wide and ambiguous category generally pointing to white-collar hired employees; among other top categories housewives form 14%, military 12% and students 8%; industry workers make up 6%.Cervera 1998, p. 151 In terms of age the prevailing category are these between 26 and 30 (17%),followed by these aged 20–25 (15%), 31–35 (13%) and 36–40 (13%), Cervera 1998, p. 167 52% of the defendants were singles and 41% were married.Cervera 1998, p. 169 In terms of their political preferences the overwhelming majority belonged to two parties, Acción Popular (40%) and Falange (38%).some 10% were recorded as supporters of Renovación Española, Cervera 1998, pp. 193–166 According to claims based on oral accounts there were two social groups which stood out as key targets of repression: the military and the religious, both approached as uniformed arms and propaganda departments of the same enemy. These claims are not substantiated by the tribunal data, which indicates that 57% of the military defendants were acquitted;Cervera 1998, p. 154 in case of the religious the figure was 75%.Cervera 1998, p. 155 Relatively high percentage of acquittals suggests that the tribunals made some effort to investigate the cases and did not default to death sentences. It also suggests that at least 50% of individuals detained and later appearing in court were not engaged in any conspiracy. How many detainees executed before facing trial were engaged in anti-Republican activities is impossible to tell,counter-espionage services kept claiming successes when fighting conspiracy, e.g. in May 1937 \\"San Francisco El Grande\\" network was broken up, later that year \\"Golfin-Corujo organisation\\" was unearthed, and in April 1938 members of \\"163 Conspiracy\\" were apprehended, Ruiz 2014, pp. 286–293. Given all documentation related is produced by security forces telling to what extent charges were made up is impossible especially that the term was applied very flexibly.e.g. paperclips with obituary of Calvo Sotelo might have been considered subversive materials, Ruiz 2014, pp. 248–9 Membership in foreign diplomatic corps did not save from arrest or execution.a Belgian diplomat Jacques Borchgrave was detained and shot in December 1936. A diplomatic scandal ensued; it was settled a year later, when the Republican government paid 1m francs of indemnity and the Belgians agreed to recognize that no government agent was involved, Ruiz 2014, p. 285. Not all cases ended up with compromise; following a similar case, Uruguay broke diplomatic relations with Spain \\"Monchín\\" Triana Many nationally known personalities fell victim to the Madrid repression. Perhaps the one who enjoyed some sort of celebrity status was Ramiro Maeztu Whitney; other writers and artists executed were Pedro Muñoz Seca, Manuel Ciges Aparicio, Francisco Vega Ceide and Álvaro Alcalá Galiano. However, the death toll was particularly heavy among politicians, including Melquíades Álvarez Gónzalez-Posada, José María Albiñana Sanz, Manuel Rico Avello, Ramón Álvarez- Valdés, Federico Salmón Amorín, Tomás Salort Olives, Rafael Esparza García, Francisco Javier Jiménez de la Puente, Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, Rafael Salazar Alonso, Antonio Bermúdez Cañete and Andrés Nin Pérez . Of the military executed the highest ranked or otherwise known were Pío López Pozas, José Rodríguez Casademunt,both in the rank of teniente general, the highest one in the Spanish army; at the outbreak of the Civil War, there were 3 tenientes generales in the army Rafael Villegas Montesinos, Osvaldo Capaz Montes, Joaquín Fanjul Goñi, Eduardo López Ochoa, Mateo García de los Reyes, Julio Ruiz de Alda and Luis Barceló Jover. High officials who lost their lives were Santiago Martín Báguenas and José Martinez de Velasco, the list of scholars includes Rufino Blanco Sánchez and Álvaro López Núñez. The outstanding religious killed were Zacarias García Villada, Pedro Poveda Castroverde and Ignacio Casanovas Camprubí. Also sport personalities might have been subject to repression, as demonstrated by cases of Ricardo Zamora Martínez (who escaped death), Ramon Triana Arroyo and Hernando Fitz-James Stuart. Time and geography Checa de Bellas Artes There is no study that suggests even approximate quantitative estimates of the scale of Madrid repression year by year. However, almost all studies suggest that most violence took place in 1936. One historian claims that 96% of executions took place in 1936;Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76 some challenge or reject the methodology altogether, others tend to accept the figures.Ruiz 2014, p. 4 An analysis of paseos only, the study based on files stored in the Madrid Audiencia Territorial, indicates that 97,6% of these killings took place before 1937,Cervera 1995-1996, p. 76 though documentation stored might also reflect changing procedural and filing patterns within the security forces. Detailed analysis of existing evidence of small-scale executions suggests that they climaxed in July (400),372 bodies were collected for burial at the Cementerio del Este, Ruiz 2014, p. 70 August (650) and September (550), with smaller figures for October and November (around 300 each) and still lower in December (below 100).Cervera 1996-1996, p. 77, also Cervera 1998, especially graphs on pp. 73–79 However, it should by no means be assumed that the overall number of victims decreased throughout 1936; the Paracuellos executions, carried out in late November and early December, took the toll of at least 2,000 victims with few estimates pointing to around 4,000. There is no doubt that the scale of the killings was much smaller throughout 1937, 1938 and 1939, especially that since the spring of 1937 the Minister of Justice Garcia Olivier strove to set up a wide network of forced labor camps and advanced the thesis that rather than be punished by death for their crimes, the enemies of the Republic should redeem their deeds by hard work.Cervera 2015, pp. 214–215 However, also after then executions continued and at times climaxed in large-scale waves of killings; in November 1937 at least 67 individuals were executed in a scam known as Túnel de Usera, while in March 1939 SIM cracked down on unspecified number of Communists, with many of them killed. Geographical analysis of repression system in the Republican Madrid does not demonstrate any specific pattern as to location of Madrid detention centers. With 4 checas per square kilometer on average, they were covering the city with dense and rather regular network;detailed analysis Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 86, Cervera 1998, pp. 64–65 even at that time suburban borough of Puente de Vallecas hosted 17 such places.see e.g. a map published in La Razón, available here Among 5 checas with the largest number of victims recorded, Checa San Bernardo, Checa Lista and Checa Santa Engracia were located in the very centre, while Checa del Ateneo and Checa del Circulo somewhat more outside.out of some 100 barrios of Madrid there were 20 with no checas, Izquierdo Alvarez 2012, p. 87 Headquarters of CPIP, perhaps the most prominent institution of Republican repression system,the number of deaths administered or otherwise effectuated by CPIP is estimated between 2,400 and 7,200, Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 18 was centrally located first at Calle de Alcala and then at Calle de Fomento; premises of DGS and its agendas were scattered around the Salamanca district, usually at or near Calle de Serrano. Until mid-1937 most detentions were carried out in the districts of Chamberi and Buenavista; later these areas ceased to stand out.Cervera 1998. pp. 161–162 Pradera de San Isidro today Geographical location of execution sites changed over time.details Cervera 1995-1996 During the first months of the conflict the inmates were taken usually to the Western districts of Madrid or to its Western suburbs, especially to Aravaca in the North, large green areas of Casa de Campo in the centre and to the park known as Pradera de San Isidro in the South.Cervera 1995-1996, p. 81 It is supposed that these sparsely populated and partially rural areas were deemed more suitable for executions than more densely inhabited Eastern and Northern peripheries of the capital. However, as the Nationalist troops approached from the West, Aravaca or Casa del Campo found themselves dangerously close to the frontline and soon became the battlefield themselves, which prompted re-orientation of executions. Since October they were taking place in the East and in the South, especially in Rivas-Vaciamadrid, along Carretera de Andalusia and near Cimiterio del Este.Cervera 1995-1996, pp. 80–81 Paracuellos de Jarama was chosen as site of the largest executions because it remained away from the frontline, because there was an easy road access from Madrid, and because local ayuntamientos were considered politically reliable, ready to organize the locals for work related to burying the bodies.Ruiz 2014, pp. 230 and onwards Protagonists Ángel Galarza During the first few weeks of the war the person responsible for public order in Republican Spain was Sebastián Pozas Perea, the Minister of Interior; scarcely involved in local Madrid issues, he nevertheless demonstrated complacency towards the revolutionary groupings.as example of Pozas' yielding position versus the militias some historians quote his stand in case of the so-called Jaen trains, Ruiz 2014, pp. 154–156 His second in command, the DSG head José Alonso Mallol, tried to preserve integrity of state structures yet overwhelmed by events, he resigned on July 31, 1936. His replacement was Manuel Muñoz Martínez,Ruiz 2014, p. 372 who since early September reported already to the new minister, Angel Galarza Gago. The two remained key public order officials in Madrid until early November 1936, when they left the capital. From this moment onwards both Galarza and Muñoz, but also their successors at ministry and DSG retained less influence over state public order structures in Madrid. Their role was about initiating and overseeing some structural changes, yet implementation and local public order policy remained largely in hands of Junta de Defensa de Madrid (JDM) and later other local bodies. JDM was set up in early November 1936; its branch responsible for public order, Consejeria de Orden Público, was assumed by Santiago Carillo Solares and his deputy José Cazorla Mauré. When a month later Carillo left Madrid, it was Cazorla who became the most potent man in security forces of the capital, the post held almost until the dissolution of JDM in April 1937.Ruiz 2014, p. 369 For a few months various individuals competed for power, like e.g. David Vázquez Baldominos, Cazorla's nominee as inspector general of Madrid police. In the summer of 1937 Gustavo Durán Martínez was appointed head of the Madrid SIM. His tenure lasted few months; in October 1937 he was replaced by Ángel Pedrero García, former deputy head of the Atadell Brigade and a personal Prieto's trustee.Julius Ruiz, Defending the Republic: The García Atadell Brigade in Madrid, 1936, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 42 (2007), pp. 114-115 Pedrero was the most important man in Madrid policing structures for 17 months; during the Casado coup in March 1939 he greatly assisted the rebels by leading SIM to arrest a number of Communist personalities in Madrid.Ruiz 2007, p. 115 He left the capital in late March; at that time the key man behind forces of order was Vicente Girauta Liñares, since mid-1938 Comisario General de Seguridad in the province.BOE 18.08.1937, available here, Ruiz 2014, p. 88 Some individuals rather briefly commanded important public order structures. This was the case of Segundo Serrano Poncela; he headed the DSG Security Council only few weeks, just in time to issue orders to extract prisoners who ended up at Paracuellos.Ruiz 2014, pp. 239–240 Federico Manzano Govantes first directed MVR and effectively managed the militias manning the Paracuellos extractions; later he moved to SIM.Ruiz 2014, p. 243 Ramón Rascón Ramírez headed CPIP personal section, sat in DGS council and led its prison department, headed commissions selecting inmates for Paracuellos and left for the front in 1937.Ruiz 2014, p. 373 Manuel Salgado Moreira vigorously commanded military counter-intelligence at the turn of 1936 and 1937 and organized some spectacular scams, like the false Siam embassy. Julio de Mora Martinez since 1938 supervised the SIM labor camp structure in the province.Ruiz 2014, p. 322 Benigno Mancebo Martín served as secretary of CPIP and then was member of provincial board which reconstructed new security forces, apart from leading a unit himself.Ruiz 2014, p. 371 Melchor Rodríguez García was briefly Delegado General de Prisiones and with limited success tried to stop the Paracuellos extractions.he secured the post of Prisons Director specifically to stop the killings and at this post he was successful until dismissed by Garcia Oliver. After few days he managed to secure his re-appointment. It is not clear whether he managed to stop the Paracuellos killings again, compare Ruiz 2014, p. 283, or whether the extractions were stopped anyway, as due to international uproar they were no longer \\"plausibly deniable\\", Ruiz 2014, p. 236 Santiago Carrillo There are individuals who did not hold top positions in power structures yet made themselves known as particularly efficient when implementing new order. Agapito García Atadell became iconic celebrity as head of CIV squad until he defected in October 1936.Ruiz 2007, pp. 97–115 Valero Serrano Tagueña and Marcos García Redondo gained names as leaders of Brigada de Amanacer and Los Linces de la República respectively.Ruiz 2014, pp. 92–98 Carmelo Iglesias Muñoz was particularly active as head of a tribunal in 1936. Felipe Sandoval Cabrerizo worked as member of revolutionary tribunal and squad leader; instrumental during both Modelo and Paracuellos actions, he joined new Seguridad and until 1938 operated as member of Mancebo's unit.Ruiz 2014, p. 373 Fernando Valenti Fernandez engaged in counter-espionage investigations and headed Brigada Especial, widely known for setting traps; he was then seconded to DEDIDE and ended up in SIM.A. Vargas, Fernando Valenti, un Sherlock Holmes republicano en el Madrid de la Guerra Civil, [in:] Guerra en Madrid service, available here Elviro Ferret Obrador commanded the DGS Technical Secretariat squad and excelled in expropriations.Ruiz 2014, p. 99 Eduardo Val Bescós as chief of CNT Defence Committee was responsible for Anarchist militias throughout most of the war.Ruiz 2014, p. 285 Politics Anarchist standard Initially key personalities holding posts related to public order in Madrid fell generally into the range between militant Republicanism and moderate socialism. Mallol and Muñoz were former Republican Radical Socialists and both joined Izquierda Republicana in the mid-1930s, and Galarza was former PRRSI militant, but unlike his colleagues, he preferred to move to the PSOE and as a Socialist and nominee of Largo Caballero nominee, he landed the job of Minister of Interior. The new head of the Madrid police who appointed in late July, Manuel López Rey Arroyo, was also the IR man.Ruiz 2014, p. 77; His tenure did not last long since in September, he was promoted to director of prisons nationwide, López-Rey Arrojo, Manuel entry, [in:] Diccionario de Catedráticos Españoles de Derecho, available here Indeed, some scholars claim that early weeks of the war were marked by attempts to maintain \\"bourgeoisie policing\\",Ruiz 2014, p. 71 the pattern that was abandoned and gave way to a new type of security while the CPIP came into existence. Its creation acknowledged actual new balance of power, certified by mushrooming party and trade union militias. Attempts to gauge the share of political influences among the units are based on presumed affiliations of checas, operating in Madrid, but that measure is inconclusive. Analysis of some 300 points broadly classified as checas seems to suggest that the anarchist CNT-FAI and the communist PCE controlled some 25% of them each, with the rest distributed among PSOE, JSU, various Republican groupings and politically-ambiguous units like UHT.see map in La Razón, published here Analysis of some 70 larger detention centres reveals a 34% domination of CNT-FAI, with PCE behind 19%, PSOE 13% and JSU behind 6% of the units.Ruiz 2014, p. 90 The CPIP itself was theoretically controlled by a 30-member board divided equally among a number of parties,Confederación Nacional de Trabajadores (CNT), Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI), Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias (FIJL), Partido Sindicalista (PS), Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE), Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), Partido Comunista Español (PCE), Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (JSU) Izquierda Republicana (IR) and Unión Republicana (UR), Jiménez Herrera 2014, p. 10 but its investigative squads reflected clear anarchist domination: 40% were related to CNT-FAI, 19% to PSOE and 19% to PCE.Ruiz 2014, p. 102 The end of \\"bourgeoisie policing\\" was marked also by transformation of CIV, the state plainclothes police, a formation that was overtaken by the Socialists, as 31% of new recruits were from UGT, 17% from PSOE, 15% from IR, 5% from PCE and mere 3% - perhaps unsurprisingly because of the anarchist position toward state structures in general and police in particular – from CNT-FAI.Ruiz 2014, pp. 90–91 IGM, a body marginally involved in security system, was also in 64% dominated by PSOE with marginal anarchist presence.Ruiz 2014, p. 101 Definitely more important MVR was similarly the socialist fiefdom; its director Manzano was a PSOE man at the timelater, he changed to join the communists, Ruiz 2014, p. 243 and 59% of militiamen registered were members of UGT; however, PCE affiliations marked 17% of them recorded and membership in the communist-dominated JSU was indicated by 14%.Ruiz 2014, pp. 180–182 Political control of state security structures in Madrid turned a corner with the government leaving the capital. Within JDM, the public order department was seized by the communists, as reflected by appointments of Carillo and Cazorla,new Consejo de la Dirección General de Seguridad, presided by Poncela, was composed mostly of members of PCU and JSU, Ruiz 2014, pp. 293–240 especially since PSOE-dominated CPIP and IGM were soon disbanded, and MVR followed suit some time afterwards. However, late 1936 and early 1937 were marked by mounting conflict between the anarchists and the communists, which following a shootoutin what looked like an accidental night control getting got out of hand anarchist militiamen wounded Pablo Yague, a PCE member and head of JDM Supply Department. Cazorla and PCE demanded dissolution of military counterintelligence brigades controlled by CNT and exemplary punishment for the culprits, but the anarchists opposed these demands and the militiamen were eventually released, Ruiz 2014, p. 289 and a cabinet war in the government led to dissolution of JDM; nevertheless, the Communists at least for some time retained control over some CIV brigades and used some in their campaigns, as suggested by Valenti's role in the fate of Nin.Ruiz 2014, pp. 289–292 The Anarchists retained a grade of control over military counter-intelligence, supervised by Salgado and Val. Of the new bodies emergent in mid-1937, the Madrid DEDIDE was controlled by PCERuiz 2014, p. 299 while the Madrid SIM fell mostly into hands of the Socialists, as certified by political affiliations of its head, Pedrero.Ruiz 2007, p. 114 The new police force, Cuerpo de Seguridad, was in 70% composed of former CPIPfor fate of dissolved CPIP members see Jiménez Herrera 2014, pp. 25–27 and in 30% of former MVR members, which given structure of these two dissolved formations suggests that PSOE got the upper hand.Ruiz 2014, p. 296 The Republicans remained visible only in juridical bodies, e.g. in Jurados de Urgencia they formed 34% of the members, with CNT-FAI coming second at 21%.Ruiz 2014, pp. 296–297 PSOE symbol It appears that throughout most of 1938 the Madrid public order system remained a politically balanced structure with Communists (DEDIDE), Anarchists (military counter-intelligence, militias) and Socialists (Seguridad, SIM) keeping each other in check. This shaky modus vivendi was demolished during the Casado coup in March 1939, when PSOE-led SIM and Anarchist-led military units crushed the Communist resistance. The showdown left some of PCE personalities executed, like it was the case of former IGM head Barceló, and some imprisoned, like it was the case of former DSG Security Council head Cazorla. The last person who might be considered the top positioned man of Republican Madrid security, Girauta, was a professional policeman-detective and can hardly be put into any political rubric. Aftermath Causa General files Few protagonists of the Madrid policing units were captured by the Nationalists in course of the war, but it was the case of Atadell, who in November 1936 was intercepted in Canary Islands when the French cruise liner that he had boarded in St. Nazaire was about to set off to Cuba.Ruiz 2007, pp. 111-113 Some high officials who no longer held their posts (Galarza, Muñoz, Carillo, Serrano Poncela, and Pozas) crossed the French border in Catalonia in early 1939. Most of them still involved left Madrid during final weeks of the war and headed for the Levantine coast, but few managed to leave Spain. Val secured a seat in an aircraft, and Duran and Salgado boarded a British warship. The rest found themselves trapped on the quays of Alicante in vain hopes for a ship to get them out. Many, like Girauta, Manzano, de Mora, Pedrero, Sandoval and Valenti, were apprehended there and identified already in April 1939. Some managed to slip through the Nationalist security net and tried to start a new life assuming a false identity. However, the Francoist hunters were determined in their pursuit; Mancebo and CazorlaCazorla was arrested by the Casadistas at the post of civil governor of Guadalajara. However, on March 28, he left prison, but whether he was released or he escaped is unclear were caught in August 1939, García Redondo in July 1940,Ruiz 2014, p. 331 Iglesias in November 1940 and Rascón in July 1941.Ruiz 2014, p. 329 Muñoz was handed over by Vichy France in August 1942. Ferret spent 14 years on the run before he was detained in June 1953.the last person charged with terror who died in captivity was Justo López de la Fuente who was commanding the 36. Brigada Mixta at a time when the unit was involved in the Tunel de Usera scam. For decades on exile, he returned to Spain in 1963. Arrested in 1964 in relation to his clandestine PCE activities, he died in prison in 1967 Most underwent brutal interrogation; Sandoval terminated it by committing suicide. The rest were all executed, some by garrote.e.g. Pedrero, Ruiz 2007, pp. 115 Duran,Duran moved from France to the US, where he married a wealthy woman and acquired American citizenship. He worked in the Museum of Modern Art in New York and than as a diplomat in Havana, recommended by his friend Hemingway. During World War II he worked for the State Department. In 1946 he was employed by the United Nations, assuming a post in the Social Department of the Refugee Division. Back in the US he was accused of being a Soviet agent, but the charges have never been proven; he died in 1969. Francisco J. Romero Salvadó, Historical Dictionary of the Spanish Civil War, Plymouth 2013, , p. 116. Galarza,following his 1939 move to France at unspecified time, though probably prior to the fall of France in 1940, he transferred to Mexico. Galarza returned to France in 1946, Galarza Gago, Angel, [in:] Catedra del Exilio service 17.09.12, available here Mallol,in 1938 Mallol was nominated Inspector General de los Consulados de España en el Norte de África and at the moment of Republican defeat served at the consular post in French Africa. In 1940 he was interned by the Vichy government, perhaps to be handed over to the Francoist Spain, but in unclear circumstances he was eventually set free. He left to Mexico either in 1940 or 1941, Ángel Herrerín López, El dinero del exilio: Indalecio Prieto y las pugnas de posguerra (1939-1947), Madrid 2009, , p. 75 Pozas,having crossed in early 1939 to France, at unspecified time - though probably prior to the fall of France in 1940 - Pozas transferred to Mexico, Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, London 2007, , p. 923 Salgado,having boarded a British warship in Gandia, Salgado was transported to the UK. He spent the rest of his life in Britain, reportedly managing a restaurant, Manuel Salgado Moreira (1899-1967), [in:] EstelNegre service, available here Serrano PoncelaSerrano crossed the French frontier in early 1939 and spent 9 months in Boulogne sur Seine. He then transferred to Santo Domingo, see the chapter De Paris a Santo Domingo in his Memorias and ValVal was imprisoned in the Vichy France, though not because of his Madrid engagements; he nearly missed transport to a Nazi death camp and was set free in 1944, Val Bescos Eduardo ‘El Serio’, [in:] lacntenelexilio service, available here; from France he moved to Britain, where until death in 1967 he worked as a waiter in a Spanish restaurant in London, Romero Salvadó 2013, p. 299 died on exile, some of them – like Serrano Poncela – as distinguished personalities.Serrano became a scholar of Spanish literature and a writer himself, residing in numerous Latin American countries. Despite his involvement in Paracuellos killings, some of his novels were published in the Francoist Spain In general, out of 1,143 individuals identified as active in the Madrid Republican public order system around 90 are known to have been executed after the war.Entregada la más amplia y novedosa investigación sobre las checas en Madrid, [in:] Universidad CEU San Pablo service, available here Some of them got captured, but survived imprisonment and were eventually set free. Rodríguez Garcíawho since his second dismissal from the prison director job kept occupying various posts in the Madrid city council and officially handed the city over to the Nationalists was sentenced to longtimeaccording to some sources he was sentenced to lifetime incarceration, Antonio Gutiérrez López, Melchor Rodrguez, el ‘Angel Rojo’: el adalidad del anarquismo humanista, [in:] feandalucia service, p. 10, available here; Preston claims he was sentenced to 20 years and some authors mention a 30-year sentence, others note that he was sentenced to life behind bars but first got the sentence commuted to 20 years and then to 5 years incarceration, but was released in 1944.Gutiérrez López, Melchor Rodrguez, el ‘Angel Rojo’: el adalidad del anarquismo humanista Anselmo Gil Burgos, head of so-called Checa de Fuencarral, was first sentenced to death, then had the sentence lowered to 30 years in prison, and was conditionally released in 1944.Burgos Gil, Anselmo entry, [in:] Fundacion Pablo Iglesias service, available here Fate of some individuals is unknown.none of the sources consulted provides information on fate of David Vazquez Baldominos, briefly head of the Fuencarral checa, temporarily head of the Madrid CIV and possibly also of the Madrid DEDIDE, the person by some deemed to be the one who shot José Robles Pazos After the war the Spanish Ministerio Fiscal launched massive investigation into the Republican repression nationwide; the scheme was commonly known as Causa General and it stockpiled colossal documentation, serving as basis for criminal investigations, historical research and propaganda activities. Indeed, authorities launched a massive campaign; it was intended to present the Republican rule in Madrid as period of savage barbarity and to honor its victims. Apart from frequent press notes, there were tens of documentary, para-documentary or historical books on what was dubbed \\"red terror\\" published every year, and Madrid featured prominently in most of them; it is estimated that some 450 related works were released until 1975, though mostly during the first two decades of Francoism.José Luis Ledesma, El 1936 más opaco: las violencias en la zona republicana durante la guerra civil y sus narrativas, [in:] Historia Social 58 (2007), p. 153 Republican system of public order was depicted in culture, presented as horrific machine of murder in numerous novels and in some films.not all films were unambigious in their presentation of the Republicans, compare Yo amé a un rojo. La película falangista maldita que Franco decidió enterrar, [in:] elconfidencial service, available here Following exhumation of bodies some execution scenes were turned into commemorative sites; this was the case especially of Paracuellos de Jarama, where El Cementerio de los Mártires was constructed and at times visited by the officials, though first of all remained frequented by relatives of these executed. Cementerio de los Mártires in Paracuellos de Jarama After the fall of Franco public attention shifted to the Nationalist repression. Memory of victims of Republican violence in Madrid was cultivated mostly by their relatives, though periodically it gained renewed attention, especially in relation to Santiago Carillo;Carillo's fate following his crossing to France in early 1939 is unclear. During World War Two as one of key PCE personalities he shuttled between France, Latin America and the USSR, but details are either unknown or highly uncertain. He returned permanently to France in the late 1940s his re-entry into politics sparked heated controversy which continued for decades, climaxing in a failed attempt to launch legal action on basis of presumed crimes against humanity.ABC 08.09.2008, available here Some major new publications, e.g. the 1983 Gibson's work on Paracuellos, renewed public attention; it was also the case of beatifications, proceeded and completed by pope John Paul II in the 1990s and Benedict XVI in the early 21st century.see e.g. LXXX Aniversario del Martirio de 134 Beatos de Paracuellos de Jarama, [in:] Diocesis de Alcalá de Henares service, available here Public debate on role and official acknowledgement of the Madrid repression system continued. In 2015 Comisionado de Memoria Histórica marked the Bellas Artes checa, the Modelo prison and the Porlier prison to feature among 15 \\"sites of historical memory\\" in Madrid.Antonia Laborde, El Comisionado renuncia a poner una placa en la checa del Círculo de Bellas Artes, [in:] El País 26.01.2017, available here The proposal generated ongoing public controversy related to the list of sites and exact wording used.Luca Constantini, Rojo, Miaja y De los Ríoz tendrán una placa conmemorativa en la ciudad, [in:] El País 28.11.2017, available here, Juan E. Plfuger, La ‘memoria histórica’ reivindica ahora las checas por su ‘lucha contra los sublevados’, [in:] gaceta.es service, available here Initially it was intended to mount plaques commemorating the victims; however, according to legal expertise obtained the proposal would be incompatible with Ley de Memoria Histórica, which prohibits \\"exaltación de la sublevación militar, de la Guerra Civil y de la represión de la Dictadura\\".Laborde 2017 So far, minor plaques are currently mounted in premises which do not form public space, e.g. in religious buildings.El Túnel de la Muerte de Usera, 80 años después, [in:] Acción Juvenil Española blog, available here Debates related to other initiatives of the Madrid town hall continue.the Madrid town hall, headed by a left-wing mayor Manuela Carmena, decided to commemorate victims of Francoism by a dedicated site on the Madrid Almudena cemetery. Some historians claim that among a few thousand names to be engraved there are few hundred names of operatives of the Republican repression system, including the notorious ones, compare Carmena homenajeará a 335 «chequistas» en un memorial de La Almudena, [in:] ABC 19.02.18, available here In historiography Paul Preston Historiography on the violence in the Civil War is massive and growing every week.\\"rarely a week goes by without two or three books being published on the subject\\", Angel Viñas, On the 80th Anniversary of the Spanish Civil War, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), p. 126 Until 1975, the focus was mostly on terror behind the Republican lines;there were 489 studies on violence in the Republican zone, published before 1975, J. J. Ledesma, El 1936 más opaco: las violencias en la zona republicana durante la guerra civil y sus narrativas, [in:] Historia Social 58 (2007), p. 153 in the late 20th century, attention shifted to Nationalist repression. Research on the Loyalist zone has been reinvigorated recently, resulting in at least three major works dedicated to Madrid;Rafael Casas de la Vega, El Terror. Madrid 1936, Toledo 1994, , Cesar Vidal, Checas de Madrid, Barcelona 2004, , Julius Ruiz, Red Terror and the Spanish Civil War, Cambridge 2015, . A few works on wartime Madrid are not dedicated exclusively to terror but dwell on it extensively, see e.g. Javier Cervera, Madrid en guerra, Madrid 1998, , or Pedro Montoliú Camps, Madrid en la guerra civil: La historia, Madrid 1998, some specific issues, especially the Paracuellos killings, also earned a sizeable literature. However, the contributions are by no means finish the issue; most of the questions raised are still subject to historiographic debates, usually unrelated to Madrid specifics but referring to violence during the Civil War in general. In the early 21st century, it was hoped that the discourse was approaching \\"synthesis\\"Francois Godicheau, La represión y la guerra civil española. Memoria y tratamiento histórico, [in:] Prohistoria 5 (2001), p. 112 and \\"normalisación\\".Godicheau 2001, p. 117 but that judgment turned decisively premature; quite to the contrary, the debate grew \\"more heated than ever before\\".Maria Thomas, Political Violence in the Republican Zone of Spain during the Spanish Civil War: Evolving Historiographical Perspectives, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), p. 140 The central point of almost all debates is the role of state structures in repression behind the Republican lines. Most generally, the discussion is whether violence occurred despite of or because of the regime. Some claim that terror was integral to the Republic's systemFernando del Rey Reguillo, Por tierras de la Mancha: Apuntos sobre la violencia revolucionaria en la Guerra Civil española (1936-1939), [in:] Alcores 11 (2011), pp. 261–262, Ruiz 2014, p. 8 and some maintain that it was fundamentally opposed by official structures.Thomas 2017, p. 145 Most specific problems are part of the general dilemma. One of these questions is the existence of a blueprint for extermination; some suggest that Republican violence resulted from a premeditated general strategy,the extermination thesis is perhaps most decisively presented in Cesar Vidal, Paracuellos – Katyn: un ensayo sobre el genocidio de la izquierda, Madrid 2005, others claim that no such plan, strategy or intention has ever existed.Ruiz 2014, pp. 333-334 Another question is whether violence might be perceived as a revolution; some scholars see the Civil War principally in revolutionary terms, but others note that violence \\"was not related to any revolutionary project\\".Cervera 1995-1996, p. 67 These who associate violence with revolutionsee e.g. Chris Ealham, Class, Culture and Conflict in Barcelona, 1898-1937, London 2004, , or Julián Casanova, Anarquismo y revolución en la sociedad rural aragonesa, 1936-1938, Madrid 1985, debate whether it was a Communist, multifold or \\"leaderless\\" one.Chris Ealham, ‘Myths’ and the Spanish Civil War: Some Old, Some Exploded, Some Clearly Borrowed and Some Almost ‘Blue’, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 42/2 (2007), p. 372 Some suppose that the state was assuming a revolutionary formatPayne 2007, p. 370 and some disagree by claiming that it competed for power with revolutionary groupings.F. J. Jiménez Herrera, ‘El Terror Rojo’. Discursos y realidades sobre la violencia en la zona republicana (fothcoming), Peter Anderson, Knowing and Acknowledging Spain’s Dark Civil War Past, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), p. 135 Accordingly, there are conflicting views of public realm shaped either by collapse of state or by excess of state powersome scholars refer to the Republican zone as to a \\"new type of democracy\\", see e.g. writings of Burnett Bollotten or Stanley G. Payne, referred after Gerald Blaney Jr, Violence, Continuity, and the Spanish State: Some Considerations, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 51/2 (2016), p. 415 or by fragmentation of power.Jiménez Herrera 2017. Fragmentation of power is a theory advanced mostly by Ledesma, see José Luis Ledesma Vera, Total War behind the Frontlines. An Inquiry into the Violence on the Republican Side in the Spanish Civil War in the Age of Total War, [in:] M. Baumeister, S. Schuler-Springorum, If you tolerate this: the Spanish Civil War in the Age of Total War, Frankfurt a/M, 2008, A separate problem is \\"autonomous violence\\"Cervera 1995-1996, p. 67 or the impact of criminal activity;see e.g. Paul Preston, The Spanish Holocaust, London 2013, , p. xiii; \\"opening of the prisons saw hundreds of common criminals released, among them sadists and psychopaths who were only too willing to use the political chaos as a shield for their activities\\", Preston 2013, p. 259 some consider it central and key for terror in the Republican rear, others apply the criminal tag to systemic nature of the Republic,Estado Español, Dictamen de la Comisión sobre ilegitimidad de poderes actuantes en 18 de julio de 1936, Barcelona 1939, p. 104 and some consider the criminal thread generally misleading. A related analytical concept is this of \\"incontrolados\\";key supporter of the thesis is Alberto Reig Tapia, see Alberto Reig Tapia, Ideología y historia: sobre la represión franquista y la guerra civil, Madrid 1984, some approach them as key agents of violence,e.g. Atadell is presented as one of \\"thieves and criminals that passed themselves off as radical or revolutionary socialists\\", opinion of Juliá 1999, p. 132, and \\"leading protagonist of uncontrollable murders in Madrid\\", Javier Tusell, Historia de España en el siglo XX. II. La crisis de los años treinta. República y Guerra Civil, Madrid 1998, , p. 315 others claim that principal protagonists of terror were firmly mounted within political structures.one author notes that only 3 CPIP operatives had been earlier convicted of crimes, Jiménez Herrera 2014, pp. 30–31. Another author claims that one of the best known cases of criminal incontrolados, Luis Bonilla, was executed by the Republicans not because he was a criminal, but because he lacked political sponsor, Julius Ruiz, \\"Incontrolados\\" en la España republicana durante la guerra civil el caso de Luis Bonilla Echevarría, [in:] Historia y política: Ideas, procesos y movimientos sociales 21 (2009), pp. 191–218 The role of ideology remains disputed; some name the public order model adopted in the Republican zone a \\"crusade\\" against ideological enemiesBlaney 2016, p. 419 and underline importance of inflammatory, ideology-driven press,one Socialist daily claimed that \\"the instigators [of rebellion] were all members of the old and rotten society...\\" and went on listing its their sub-categories, El Socialista 21.07.1936; another called \\"don’t be sentimental\\", CNT 31.07.1936; one more demanded \\"death penalty\\" to \\"hidden enemies\\", Claridad 09.10.1936; top Republican personalities like Ibárruri or Nelken penned articles and delivered lectures by some scholars presented as inflammatory, Ruiz 2014, pp. 60, Julius Ruiz, Militant history and the Spanish Civil War. Paul Preston’s The Spanish Holocaust, [in:] Academia.edu service, pp. 26, 37–38, available here others claim that focus on ideology obscures a complex tangle of various factors.Anderson 2017, p. 133 One more point is reactive nature of terror behind the Republican lines.\\"in contrast, the repression in the Republican zone was hot-blooded and reactive\\", Preston 2013, pp. xii-xiii, same opinion in Cathie Carmichael, The Need to Record the Past, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 51/2 (2016), p. 438 There are scholars who discuss outbreaks of violence in relation to specific preceding eventslike Nationalist bombing raids, radio harrangues of Queipo de Llano or news aboud the Badajoz massacre; Preston 2013 titled his a chapter on Paracuellos killings \\"the response of a terrorised city\\" or to systemic features of Spanish society and politics.like decades of establishment-driven politics or omnipresence of Church and religion; one scholar notes that \\"Spain’s harshly repressive society had produced a brutalized underclass\\", Preston 2013, p. 259 Others either question factual sequences presentedone scholar claims that Nationalist bombing raids, supposed to have led to outburst of violence in August 1936, have never taken place, Ruiz 2012, p. 190 or the logic of structural links advanced and reject the \\"reactive\\" label. A related problem is this of continuity; some students see the wartime unrest as climax of violence mounting through previous decades,see e.g. claims that violence of the Civil War \\"can be explained through reading of the early Republican period\\", Fernando del Rey, The Spanish Second Republic Revisited: From Democratic Hopes to Civil War (1931-1936), London 2013, , pp. 432–433 others make it clear that these are two clearly distinct phenomena.Blaney 2016, p. 415, Roberto Villa García, The Second Republic: Myths and Realities, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 51/2 (2016), p. 421 One more and also related puzzle is about selective or sweeping nature of terror, namely whether it was directed against specific individuals, whether it was generally chaotic or whether it was aimed against particular sections of the population.see e.g. Cervera 1998, p. 153. The author inspected verdicts of popular tribunals and concluded that 50% of cases resulted in acquitttal and death penalties formed 8% Many authors claim that since there was no real threat of Fifth Column,one author admits that anti-Republican conspiracy might have involved 3,000 individuals and further 30,000 \\"collaborators\\", yet notes they were engaged mostly in mutual assistance, evasion and psychological warfare, with cases of gathering intelligence and small-scale sabotage being rather marginal, Ruiz 2014, p. 287 the Republican repressive measures were means of terrorizing the population; many others relate violence to anti-Republican conspiracy and consider it mostly means of fighting Nationalist subversion.\\"in addition, there was the real military necessity of combating the enemy within\\", Preston 2013, p. xiii, on nocturnal snipers, saboteurs and agents Preston 2013, p. 293; in his 536-page monograph on wartime Madrid one author dedicates 100 pages to the Fifth Column, Cervera 1998, pp. 235–338 The role of the Soviets remains another point of contention; some students consider it instrumental,Angel Viñas, Aportaciones para una reescritura de la Guerra Civil española, [in:] Revista de libros 59 (2010), pp. 9–12 others tend to view it as of minor importance.Ruiz 2014, p. 257 Julian Casanova Most if not all questions discussed in general translate also to specifics of Madrid; in case of the capital they might be anchored in issues related to 100-day period of central government institutions operating from the capital, genesis and role of CPIP, transformation of police force, relations between JDM and central authorities operating from Valencia, mechanics of the Paracuellos executions, responsibility of single individuals like Carillo, Orlov or Galarza, functioning of local branches of central institutions like DEDIDE, SIM or DSG, role of the Fifth Column, specifics related to proximity to the frontlines, local balance of power between key political groupings or Madrid dynamics of the Casado coup. However, local-scale analysis has not significantly contributed to reaching consensus in general debate and in most of the cases discussed agreement seems to be nowhere near; moreover, in terms of tension and vitriol historiographic debate has been recently brought to another levelcompare contributions of Blaney, Villa Garcia, Alvarez Tardio and del Rey in Journal of Contemporary History 51/2 (2016) and Vinas, Anderson, Thomas, Casanova and Marco in Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), all triggered by a review article of Ealham in Journal of Contemporary History 48/1 (2012); most authors suspect their adversaries of pursuing a hidden political or ideological agenda. Escalation of abuse seems to be ongoing, see the article “Cry babies” or authoritarians?, being prepared by Chris Ealham, available here and some suggest that it is less of a historiography and more of a \\"memory war\\".Fernando del Rey, The Spanish Second Republic and Political Violence, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 51/2 (2016), p. 431 See also * Red Terror (Spain) * Paracuellos massacres * Madrid Defense Council * Revisionism (Spain) Footnotes Further reading * Rafael Casas de la Vega, El Terror.

Formerly an important military base overseeing the Portuguese-administered enclave of Macao, it is now a Chinese manufacturing center, with particular emphasis on household appliances, airconditioners, and printing supplies. Name Qiánshān is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the subdistrict's Chinese name , meaning \\"Front Hill\\".. This was formerly also written as \\"'Tsëen-shan\\" using Robert Morrison's system, \\"Ch‘ien-shan\\" using the Wade-Giles system, and as \\"Sinshan\\" for the Chinese Postal Map. The same characters are pronounced Cin- saan or Tchin-Sán in Cantonese; this was also formerly written \\"Tchin-shang\\" or \\"'\\" by Portuguese authorities on Macao. In historical records, the name also sometimes appears as Tsëen-shan-chae, from the addition of zhài (, jzaai⁶, \\"fort\\" or \\"stockade\\").. Qianshan was also formerly known as Casa Blanca,. Casa-blanca, Casa Branca, Casa-branca, or Casa Braca from the white residence of the Macanese subprefect. History \\"Cazablanc\\" and the border wall in 1781 Remains of the old fort wall at Qianshan Qianshan was formerly a separate village, first settled under the Southern Song in 1152 (Shaoxing22) to produce salt from the Qianshan River. The location once overlooked the inner harbor of Macao, whose border wall lay to its southwest. and main settlement about 3 km farther. With the Portuguese developing a permanent enclave there during the late Ming, Qianshan—being the Chinese settlement nearest to its peninsula's northern border—was turned into a military outpost in 1621. By 1640, it comprised a 500-man garrison. Qianshan became the seat of the subprefect or \\"keun-min-foo\\" (t s jūnmínfǔ) in 1731. He was charged with dealing with the foreign settlement and overseeing their trade with Guangzhou (\\"Canton\\"). As part of these duties, he controlled the permits needed for pilots yǐnshuǐrén) of the ships sailing north through the Humen (\\"Bocca Tigris\\" or \\"Bogue\\") to the Huangpu Anchorage (\\"Whampoa\\", now Pazhou).. He would ensure that foreign ships headed upriver had some cargo apart from silver dollars and bullion. He was also sometimes obliged to quarantine Macao's market, prohibiting Chinese farmers and merchants from trading there and supplying its food, in order to maintain the freedom of the area's Chinese to practice Buddhist and local rituals, which the Portuguese periodically attempted to prohibit. In the lead-up to the First Opium War, Lin Zexu and Deng Tingzhen visited Qianshan during their procession from Xiangshan (now Zhongshan) to visit the Portuguese authorities at Macao on 3 September 1839. From 1862 to 1874, the Qianshan River was thoroughly dredged by Chinese authorities to create a safe shipping channel for the communities on its banks, including Qianshan. On 22–23 September 1874, Qianshan was hit by a devastating typhoon: around 4000 were killed in Macao, Wanzai (\\"Lapa\\"), and Qianshan and hundreds of bodies that washed ashore had to be buried by local hospitals or incinerated by the government. The area continued to be pummeled by typhoons—56 in the century from 1883 to 1983—but none on the scale of the 1874 disaster. Qianshan benefited from Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy and was granted town status in 1987. As settlements throughout the Pearl River Delta expanded, though, Qianshan no longer formed a separate settlement and was reorganized as a subdistrict of Zhuhai's Xiangzhou District in August 2001.. Qianshan Port, which opened onto the Qianshan River, was closed in the 2000s, with its ticket hall becoming a warehouse and the waterfront being developed as a public park. Landmarks Entrance to the Meixi Royal Stone Archways Meixi Archways Qianshan's Meixi Village is the home to the Meixi Royal Stone Archways. The three engraved granite archways were built by order of the Guangxu Emperor in 1886 and 1891 in honor of Chen Fang (t s Chén Fāng) or Chun Afong, a native of Meixi who served as China's first consul to Hawaii and became a prominent philanthropist. It is surrounded by a park. covering the old Chen estate, expanded by Chen's son Tony (t s Chén Xírú),. and its gardens..

It also serves as a demonstration facility in its own right, as with its research into techniques for growing organic olecranon peaches (t s yīngzuǐtáo, \\"eagle-beak peaches\\") in the Pearl River Delta.. Since 2010, Qianshan Waterfront has been developed as a large community park.. Economy Through the early stages of Qianshan's history, the main industry was refining salt from the Qianshan River under the auspices of the Jindou Bay Saltworks in Xiangshan, which began operation under the Tang.. Under Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy, Zhuhai was established as one of China's first special economic zones in 1980. Companies based in Qianshan enjoy preferential government policies, and some have grown into some of the largest firms in the world.. Qianshan-based Gree Electric Appliances (est. 1989), the world's largest residential air-conditioner manufacturer, operates factories in China, Brazil, and Pakistan.. It is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The Qianshan Interior Decoration and Electric Appliance Marketplace is the biggest in the Zhujiang River Delta.. Xiangzhou District as a whole is the world leader in printing supplies, producing 70% of the world's color ribbons and 60% of its ink cartridges.

It purchased the American printer company Lexmark on 30 November 2016 for $3.9 billion.. Culture Mandarin is used for educational and official purposes, while the local dialect is a form of Cantonese. During the 1990s and 2000s, however, an influx of migrants meant that those holding local hukous were outnumbered 2:1 by natives of other parts of China. The Phoenix-Rooster Dance is a local form of the mix of dance and costume seen in lion and dragon dancing. Performers construct a bird costume out of bamboo and other materials that can turn its head and flap its wings. Performances run through a gamut of emotions and activities, attested since 1621 during the late Ming. The art came to Xiangshan County in the early Qing and became particularly associated with Qianshan during the early Republican Period when the performer Li Fuwu opened a studio that taught both kung fu and the dance. His pupils Bao Liu and Li Shoushan continued the tradition, which is still celebrated at local cultural events.. Events Since around 2011, the Agricultural Paradise has held an annual Pumpkin Art Festival for the first six days of the Chinese New Year, awarding up to 10,000 in prizes for big or unusual pumpkins. Other activities include magic shows, \\"pumpkin art dancing\\", pumpkin bowling, and pumpkin noodle-making. Transportation Construction of the Guangzhu MRT in 2012.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History In the mid-1800s, sailing across Saginaw Bay could be risky, and the nearest refuge from oncoming storm was the mouth of the St. Clair River, 80 miles away. Laker captains requested the construction of a more accessible harbor, and in 1872 this location was chosen. Construction began in 1873. In 1875, a skeletal light tower was put in place to mark the location of the entrance to the partially completed harbor. The current Harbor Beach Light was constructed in 1885. That same year marked the end of breakwater construction; the entire project was completed at a cost of $975,000. In 1903, the wooden breakwaters were found to be deteriorating, and the next year the Army Corps of Engineers began replacing the timber structures above the waterline with a concrete superstructure. The main breakwater was completed by 1909, with the north and south sections following in 1911/12 and 1916/17. Major rehabilitation was performed in the late 1960s / early 1970s, and again in the 1980s. Description Harbor Beach Light on breakwater, from Bathing Beach Park The navigation structures include nearly 7,900 feet of breakwater surrounding the Harbor Beach harbor. The breakwater is constructed of stone- filled cribwork, and is laid in three pieces; with the first running approximately 1500 feet eastward, beginning three-quarters of a mile north of the dock. There is a gap of about 300 feet to the next section of breakwater, which runs approximately 300 feet eastward, 3960 feet southeast, and another 300 feet east. There is a gap of 600 feet for the entrance, followed by the final section of breakwater which runs 1900 feet southward. The inner basin is dredged to a depth of 23 feet. The Harbor Beach Light is located on the breakwater at the mouth of the harbor. The breakwater is capped with concrete.

The neighborhood features access to the Connecticut River through the Sue Ellen Panitch River Center and the Land of Providence reservation. Ingleside is also home to the Holyoke Mall, the Nuestras Raices farm, the Sisters of Providence of Holyoke, the Providence Behavioral Health Hospital, and several recreational and historical venues. While Ingleside holds the same ZIP code as the rest of Holyoke, it is served by its own post office, maintained at the Holyoke Mall.Ingleside Mall, Location Details. United States Postal Service. History Prior to the annexation of Holyoke from West Springfield in 1850, Ingleside was the site of a ferry known as the Jones' ferry, its landing sites are known as Jones Ferry Road on both the Holyoke and Chicopee sides of the Connecticut River today. The word ingle, stemming from a Gaelic word for fire, may have been chosen for lime kilns which were once in the vicinity in its time as a part of West Springfield. The origin of the name Ingleside itself seems to stem from the eponymous Ingleside Hotel, a large complex constructed by one Jones S. Davis, a key figure in the creation of the city's Lyman Mills, which are now known as Open Square. Completed in 1868, the hotel cost Mr. Davis a total of $162,000 (approximated $3.6 million in 2016 US Dollars), but following the Panic of 1873 was sold at auction to one N.S. Chandler \\"for a little less than $30,000\\". The hotel, which featured a farm, telegram station, gasworks, and railway stop, was short-lived however, and closed in the winter of 1874 due to low attendance in the midst of an economic depression. The hotel was razed by fire on July 25, 1875, with some indication that the blaze \\"was the work of an incendiary\\". The hotel and its contents were insured in total for $20,000. Though the hotel itself stood on the shores of the Connecticut for less than a decade, the Ingleside name would persist as that of the surrounding area long after its absence. Geography Map of the eastern portion of Ingleside as it appears in Richard's Standard Atlas of Holyoke, c. 1911 The contemporary boundaries of Ingleside are defined by Rt 91 to its west, railroad tracks to its north west, Springdale park to its northeast, the Connecticut River to its east, and West Springfield to its south. Geology Ingleside's western boundaries contain primarily sand and gravel deposits created by aeolian processes, creating an abundance of gravelly silty loam. In contrast the easterly portion of the neighborhood, which is adjacent to the Connecticut River, consists of floodplain alluvium.MassGIS Data - Surficial Geology (1:250,000), MassGIS, Executive Office for Administration and Finance The boundary of Ingleside which borders the river contains FEMA regulated floodways which are part of a 100-year floodplain, defined by the agency as areas with a 1% chance of flooding per annum.MassGIS Data - FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer, MassGIS, Executive Office for Administration and FinanceDefinitions of FEMA Flood Zone Designations, Map Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency Transportation Streets and highways Ingleside is directly accessible from U.S. Interstate 91 via Exit 15, Lower Westfield Rd./Ingleside. U.S. Route 5 traverses the neighborhood from north to south, with direct access to I-91 via exit 14, and the Massachusetts Turnpike I-90 via exit 4 at Holyoke's border with West Springfield. To its north Route 5 splits from Main Street, which continues northeasterly toward Springdale. Several bus routes serve Ingleside, including PVTA R29 at Providence Hospital, P20 at the Holyoke Crossing shopping center, and these routes, along with the P20 Express and R41, serve the Holyoke Mall. Peter Pan Buslines also serves the Holyoke Mall stop with connections to points north and Springfield Union Station.Pioneer Valley Transit Authority, Routes and Schedules Rail Ingleside was originally a stop on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad but is no longer serviced by passenger rail service. A freight railway defines the northwest of the neighborhood and is presently a rail connection for the Pioneer Valley Railroad, which services rails between Westfield, Southampton, and the factory-access railways in Holyoke's canal district. Boat Public boat access on the Connecticut River is available for small craft from the Sue Ellen Panitch River Center on Jones Ferry Road.Connecticut River Greenway State Park, HG&E; and MassDCR While portage is required for all points north of the Hadley Falls Dam or south of the dam in Enfield, Connecticut, the river can be navigated largely uninterrupted between these two points.

Purchased from the Scottish Presbyterian church in 1975, Saint Mark's was the first Coptic Orthodox church in Europe. It was the seed church of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Britain and Ireland, first served by three hieromonks who later became members of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Services are conducted in both English and Arabic. The exterior of the church has remained almost unchanged since its construction in 1862-1863 in the Victorian Gothic style. However, the interior has changed significantly since then: in the 19th century to address aesthetic and practical issues apparent after the initial construction, involving several architects in the changes, and in the 20th century with its conversion to a Coptic Orthodox church. As part of the conversion, it was the first church outside Egypt to display Neo-Coptic iconography. History Construction (1862–1863) The construction of the church building originated in a suggestion made by the minister of the Regent Square church to the Reverend Gavin Carlyle, a nephew of Edward Irving, that Carlyle should travel from Edinburgh to preach in London.St. John’s Presbyterian Church, Kensington 1862–1962, n.d., p. 7: St. John’s Presbyterian Church (United Reformed) The Last Years 1962–1975, n.d., pp. 13–14. Tenders for the construction were accepted in July 1862, and in December the trustees accepted a 99-year lease at the site.St. John’s Presbyterian Church, Kensington 1862–1962, n.d., p. 7: B.N. 11 July 1862, p. 37; 18 July 1862, p. 58. The architect, J.M. McCulloch, and the builders, R. and A. M. Greig, quoted a price of £3,368, but costs eventually rose to £6,000 as the church was opened in May 1863.British Almanac for 1864. Companion, p. 161: B.N. 11 July 1862, p. 37; 18 July 1862, p. 58. As a Scottish Presbyterian church (1863–1975) After the initial construction was completed, there were practical problems and aesthetic discontent with the interior of the church. A visitor to the church remarked:Pepperell, pg. 29 To attempt to address these issues, alterations were soon begun. In 1866–1867, advice was sought from J. J. Stevenson about acoustical matters, and in particular the design of the pulpit.K.P.L., MS. 21555. An architect, J. Theodore Barker, made large charges between 1876–1880 and 1882. A chancel arch was inserted, galleries inserted at either end of the transept to increase the seating from 500 to 750. A missing organ was supplied and the pulpit replaced. The heating apparatus and stained glass were also replaced in the work.St. John’s Presbyterian Church, Kensington 1862–1962, n.d., p. 8: K.P.L., MS. 21561: Kensington News, 11 Nov. 1876; 9 Dec. 1876: M.B.W. case no. 31368: R.I.B.A. Library, Fellowship Nomination Papers, J. T. Barker, 9 Jan. 1882. The last service of the Presbyterian church was held in October 1975. The congregation joined the former Congregational Kensington Chapel further up Allen Street, within the Kensington United Reformed Church.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol42/pp386-394#p30 As a Coptic Orthodox church (1975–present) The nave of the church in 2015 In 1975 St John's was sold to the Coptic Orthodox Church and has been home to the congregation of St Mark's ever since. The church was consecrated by Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria in 1979, as the first Coptic church in Europe. Ministry and functions A single holy liturgy is held each morning from Tuesday to Saturday, with two Sunday liturgies, one in Arabic and one in English. Description The church is built in the Victorian Gothic style. Exterior Externally the church stands about the same as when it was first constructed in 1863. Interior =Iconography= St Mark's was the first church outside of Egypt to display Neo-Coptic iconography. There are two stained glass windows, and a cycle of narrative icons, including a very large icon depicting the martyrdom of Saint Mark.

It was formed in 1194 in the courthouse of the Church of Saint Peter by a congregation of citizens headed by the Latin patriarch, Radulph II. The prince, Bohemond III, was at the time imprisoned by Leo II of Armenia, and the citizens had driven out the Armenians who came to occupy the city. The commune, with its elected members, took over the administration. To legalize their position, they quickly paid homage to Bohemond III's eldest son and regent, Raymond, who gave them a formal recognition. Despite the Latin Church's sympathy for the commune, it is more likely that the idea came from the Genoese and Pisan merchants, who were anxious about the future of their trade under an Armenian domination; the Italians were much more familiar with communes than the French in any case. It was the Greeks, however, who soon took a leading role.

She is an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Center at the University. Battle-Baptiste's research focuses on \\"how the intersection of race, gender, class, and sexuality look through an archaeological lens\\". Battle-Baptiste is currently working on \\"Rules of Engagement: Community-Based Archaeology as a Tool for Social Justice\\" (Left Coast Press). Her current research takes place on the Millars Plantation site on Eluethera island in the Bahamas, at a community-based archeology project. She focuses on the archeology of gender and race because “if people are being written about, archaeology can be used not only to fill the gaps, but to create alternative stories and histories.\\"  Early life and education  Battle-Baptiste grew up in the Bronx and was exposed to history through her mother, who taught on Long Island. She attended Virginia State University, an HBCU in Petersburg, with the same goal, then earned her master's degree in history at The College of William and Mary. At a summer internship, she met several African-American women who were archaeologists, and this sparked her interest in the subject. She pursued her Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin in the African Diaspora program in anthropology, and focused her studies on archaeology through the lens of race and gender. Her dissertation, titled “A Yard to Sweep: Race, Gender and the Enslaved Landscape” was published in 2004 and based on her research at Andrew Jackson's Tennessee plantation, The Hermitage. It explores the gender power dynamics in captive African domestic areas.  Career  Battle-Baptiste has participated in archaeological excavations at Colonial Williamsburg, The Hermitage, the Rich Neck Plantation in Virginia the W.E.B.

Ducal is French for Duke. History Ducal was founded in 1969 by Landewyck Tobacco as a response to the price war which emerged on the cigarette market in the 1960s, which opted smokers to go for filtered and king size 25-pack cigarettes instead of the traditional 20-packs. The brand became very popular from the 1970s onward and is one of the most popular regional brands, along with Lexington. Advertising Various adverts were made for Ducal, such as ashtrays, billboards and advertising pins. Controversy In 2014, two young E-cigarette businessmen named their product \\"Ducal\\", similar to the traditional cigarette brand. Currently, Ducal is protected under class 34 of the International Classification of Goods and Services, namely that of tobacco and smokers. However, the same law also falls under the field of which the electronic cigarette sits. In January 2018 a judge has yet to decide whether or not the name is a breach of the brand protection law. Markets The brand is mainly sold in Luxembourg, but also was or still is sold in Belgium, Netherlands (as rolling tobacco), Germany and Peru.

Seven of these have advanced to the third round, which was announced July 22, 2020 (four encryption/key-establishment and three signature schemes). Background A NIST published report from April 2016 cites experts that acknowledge the possibility of quantum technology to render the commonly used RSA algorithm insecure by 2030. As a result, a need to standardize quantum-secure cryptographic primitives arose. Since most symmetric primitives are relatively easy to modify in a way that makes them quantum resistant, efforts have focused on public-key cryptography, namely digital signatures and key encapsulation mechanisms. In December 2016 NIST initiated a standardization process by announcing a call for proposals. The competition is now in its third round out of expected four, where in each round some algorithms are discarded and others are studied more carefully. NIST hopes to publish the standardization documents by 2024, but may speed up the process if major breakthroughs in quantum computing are made. It is currently undecided whether the future standards be published as FIPS or as NIST Special Publication (SP). Round One Under consideration were: ( ~~strikethrough~~ means it had been withdrawn) {  - ! Type ! PKE/KEM ! Signature !

The first track contains the algorithms which appear to have the most promise, and will be considered for standardization at the end of the third round. Algorithms in the second track could still become part of the standard, after the third round ends. NIST expects some of the alternate candidates to be considered in a fourth round. Finalists {  - ! Type ! PKE/KEM ! Signature -  Lattice  * CRYSTALS- KYBER * NTRU * SABER  * CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM * FALCON -  Code-based  * Classic McEliece  -  Multivariate   * Rainbow } Alternate candidates {  - !

NIST claims they shall take such considerations into account while picking the winning algorithms. NIST holds signed statements from the submitters clearing any legal claims, while trying to clear the possibility the third parties will raise such claims.

Written and directed by Corey Pearson, the film is the first of a planned five-part saga, entitled The Five Frequencies, which follow five orphans as they learn to develop their own unique powers in order to save humanity. Plot Harmony centers on the titular 21-year-old homeless woman, played by Jessica Falkholt, who can absorb fear from anyone that she comes in contact with. Manifesting within her as a black liquid, the fear can then be washed off, but absorbing too much fear can kill her. Harmony meets Mason, played by Jerome Meyer, a socially awkward man who is seemingly void of fear. Relieved that she can feel no pain with him, she falls in love. However, she soon crosses paths with Jimmy, played by Eamon Farren, whose evil presence exudes fear. After a near-death experience, Harmony and Mason must unite to balance the growing negative energy.

It was located on the to of the North Eastern Railway (NER), an extension of the earlier Byers Green Branch of the Clarence Railway (CR).  History  The station opened in 1885 as a stop on a new single-track line built by the North Eastern Railway linking to Burnhouse Junction, where it joined the earlier Byers Green Branch built by the Clarence Railway (a predecessor of the NER) in 1837. Beyond Burnhouse Junction, passenger trains continued over the former CR route to . In 1925 the station was served by eight trains to Ferryhill and seven to Bishop Auckland. However, due to the rural nature of the western section of this new through route, traffic between and Bishop Auckland was fairly light and as a consequence Coundon station closed to passenger on 4 December 1939 when passenger services on the line west of Spennymoor were withdrawn. The station closed completely in May 1948 though freight continued to pass through its site until September 1956. The trackbed of the railway through Coundon has been converted into the Auckland Way, a path for walkers and cyclists.

The station was on the North Yorkshire and Cleveland's railway line between Picton and Stokesley. The line was extended progressively until it met the Whitby and Pickering Line at . Potto station was closed in 1954 to passengers and four years later to goods. History The station was opened with the line in 1857 when the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway Company built their line between Picton and Stokesley. Picton became a north facing junction on the Leeds Northern Railway that allowed services on the line through Potto to work between Stockton and . The line and stations were taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1859. The station was in use for passengers until 1954 when the line became freight only, with freight being withdrawn by December 1958. During the last few years of operation, only the eastbound track was used through the station, whilst the westbound track was used for wagon storage. The station had only nine stationmasters, of whom the first three, were from the same family (grandfather, father and son) and were incumbent between 1857 and 1911. The last stationmaster was appointed in 1945 and he formally ended his tenure as stationmaster in 1960, just over a year after the line had closed. Between 1867 and 1892, Potto was the junction for the Whorlton Branch line which served Ailesbury ironstone mines in the Whorlton and Swainby region to the south of Potto. Cabin in the former station yard After closure, the main station building became a private house with the goods yard and other sidings becoming part of the freight depot for a road freight haulier. The haulage company have left the weighbridge cabin and former NER crane in-situ.

Some notable people of the time devoted themselves to societies such as the Commons Preservation Society, now known as the Open Spaces Society, in order to gain protection for some clearly defined areas . One of these areas was Epping Forest on the outskirts of London. It was an area beginning to suffer encroachments of building development and enclosure. The local people of Loughton were also, by tradition, taking a limited quantity of wood from the forest under what was termed their 'lopping rights'. The enclosure of the lands within the forest bounds was threatening the performance of the annual lopping tradition and thus, a dispute also arose over the removal by private individuals of forest considered to be in public ownership. Following the intervention of a number of bodies and interested parties, some Acts of Parliament were enacted gradually bringing about the desired protections. The Epping Forest Act 1878 brought together the diverse rules and prescribed how the Forest was to be protected. The Act formally records the Crown renouncing rights over the land and the Corporation of London, having bought acres of unenclosed Epping Forest land, named as the official conservators.  Purpose  A local Act of the United Kingdom parliament for the disafforestation of Epping Forest and the preservation and management of unenclosed parts thereof as an open space for the recreation and enjoyment of the public. The management of the forest became, via the Act, the Corporation of London. The Act removed the rights of Loughton householders to lop wood within the forest for which, in substitution, a public hall was constructed in the town. The hall was named The Lopping Hall. The Lopping Hall is maintained, and its business carried on, by the charity organization called The Lopping Endowment, a UK registered charity number 228236. Police Constables with special powers granted under section 43 of the Act are known as Forest Keepers in order to ensure the proper protection of the forest.

Hanging Sword Alley is an alley in the Alsatia district of London, running between Whitefriars Street and Salisbury Square, close to Fleet Street. History The alley was first known as Ouldwood Alley in the 16th century, when it was in the manor of the Bishop of Salisbury, who owned twenty-four tenements there. It was then named after the sign of a fencing school recorded in 1564, and tuition in this martial art remained in the area until the 17th century. Walter Bell described the alley as it was at the start of the twentieth century, Blood Bowl House \\"The Idle 'Prentice betrayed and taken in a Night-Cellar with his Accomplice\\". William Hogarth depicted Blood Bowl House in Industry and Idleness. In the 18th century, the street became known as Blood Bowl Alley after a night-cellar which was an infamous drinking den. In 1743, George Morgan encountered a lady in Ludgate Hill and offered to escort her home. The lady, Mary Stansbury, took him to a house in the alley. After some pleasantries and exchange of money, they undressed and went to bed but she then left him to be robbed by a man with a club. Morgan defended himself with his cane and summoned the constable. The Stansburys were tried for assault and the theft of his property: a pair of silver knee- buckles; a pair of silver shoe-buckles; a cambric stock; a bath metal stock- buckle; a silk handkerchief; a hat; a periwig; five moidores; half a guinea and three shillings.

The company was founded in Lesotho, where it manufactures the ACE One Energy System. The company's headquarters are in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. History African Clean Energy (ACE) is a family-owned business, founded in 2011 by Ruben Walker and his father, Stephen Walker. Ruben Walker studied environmental engineering in Australia. Prior to founding ACE, Ruben owned a bamboo flooring company, as a sustainable alternative to wood. The ACE One was developed in 2014 with support from crowdfunding and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. As of 2017, the company is active in Lesotho, Cambodia and Uganda.Stephen Walker, an expert in manufacturing, helped set up ACE's factories in Lesotho and Cambodia. The company expects to open a third factory in Uganda in 2020. The Biomass Cooking Sector The ACE One and solar PV Panel More than 3 billion people cook using solid biomass fuels like wood, crop waste, coal and animal dung. There are also 1.2 billion people without access to electricity, who currently rely on dangerous fuels like kerosene for lighting. The World Health Organization estimates that 4.3 million people die prematurely every year from illnesses attributable to household air pollution from burning solid fuels. These include lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, pulmonary disease and childhood pneumonia. Exposure to indoor smoke is particularly high amongst women and girls, who are typically responsible for cooking. The responsibility of sourcing fuel for cooking and heating also predominantly falls on women, who spend hours each day collecting firewood for their homes, cutting short their potential to study or do other things. The ACE One Energy System was designed to address these issues, while still being compatible with widely available biomass fuels, such as sticks, animal waste and agricultural waste. It is capable of burning any type of solid biomass smokelessly, and provides electricity for households that do not have access to the grid. The Product Functionality The ACE One has an integrated lithium-ion ferrophosphate battery which powers a small fan. The fan draws oxygen into the burning chamber of the device, intensifying the fire inside. This causes the biomass to gasify, ensuring complete combustion and creating a smokeless flame. The battery will power the fan for 20 hours, and can be charged using the included 10W solar panel. The latest ACE One includes a microprocessor and is sold with a second-use Samsung smartphone, giving the device \\"smart\\" capabilities. This means that customers can connect their smartphones with the ACE One. Customers can use the pre-installed ACE Connect app on their phones in order to track their loan repayments and contact ACE customer services directly. ACE are using the ACE One's smart functionality to implement a flexible 'pay-as-you-save' model as the unit can now be remotely switched off if the customer stops paying for it. The Colorado State University has certified the ACE One as an IWA-ISO Tier 3 for emissions and efficiency, and 4 for safety in laboratory tests. The product has been field tested in Cambodia by the Berkeley Air Monitoring Group, who estimate that every 25,000 units in use will avert as many as 40 early deaths, and avert 1,295 Disability-adjusted life years (aDALYs). The ACE One Energy System Key Features * Fuel Savings: Through efficient combustion, the ACE One can reduce fuel use by up to 70% compared to an open fire. In Cambodia, researchers found that the product reduces fuel use by 52% compared to traditional Khmer stoves. By using the ACE One, customers can cut their basic energy expenses by up to 80%. * Reduced Emissions: The ACE One burns biomass fuels without smoke, reducing CO and PM 2.5 emissions by as much as 95% compared to an open fire. * Solar Electricity: The ACE One has an integrated USB port which can be used for charging mobile devices. The product also includes an LED lamp attachment. The Business Model ACE Cambodia African Clean Energy is a for-profit company. It is currently active in Lesotho, Cambodia and Uganda, and its flagship factory is located in Lesotho. The ACE One is sold direct to consumers in these countries using an instalment-based payment model at a cost of about $100 each. This ensures that the product is affordable to people who would be unable to afford a large lump sum payment.To date, the company has sold about 60,000 units. The company has a potential market of approximately 900 million households. ACE is currently expanding its mobile retail shops to give more people access to its products and services, in a project which is being co-funded by the European Union. African Clean Energy sponsors ACE Maseru FC, an A division football team in Lesotho. The company also manages the Lesotho Orphans Project, an initiative for donating stoves to orphaned children in Lesotho. ACE is an equal opportunity employer, that has committed to ensuring that 50% of employees are women.The company currently employs 193 people globally and another 12 in Amsterdam.

The PSV received two ministerial posts in the Arron cabinet. In 1977, the NPK once again won 22 of the 39 seats in a slightly changed composition, with another two PSV ministers in the cabinet. As a result of the military coup in 1980 led by sergeant Dési Bouterse, this government came to an end prematurely. After the restoration of democracy, the PSV no longer played a major role in Surinamese politics.

Her work uses high-pressure, high-temperature experiments and stable isotope geochemistry to understand the formation of planets in the solar system.  Career  Anat Shahar obtained a B.S. and a M.E. in geological engineering from Cornell University in 2002 and 2003, respectively. She earned her Ph.D. in geochemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2008, while working in the lab of Edward Young. She went on to complete her postdoctoral research at the Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington and in 2009 was appointed staff scientist. Since 2012 she also has served as an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Geology at the University of Maryland. Shahar was awarded the Nininger Meteorite Award, which recognizes outstanding student achievement in the meteoritical sciences, for her 2008 paper on \\"Astrophysics of CAI formation as revealed by silicon isotope LA-MC-ICPMS of an igneous CAI\\". In 2012 Shahar was awarded Stanford Universitys Blaustein Fellowship, which helped fund her work investigating the pressure-dependent relationship of the isotopic composition of iron alloys, published in Science. In 2015, Shahar won the F.W. Clarke Medal, an award from the Geochemical Society that recognizes a single outstanding contribution to geochemistry or cosmochemistry by an early-career scientist. Shahar won the 2016 Mineralogical Society of America’s Young Investigator Award, given to individuals near the beginning of their professional careers, who have made outstanding published contributions to the field of mineralogy. The award also made her a Life Fellow of the society. Shahar also serves as geochemistry secretary for the Volcanology, Geochemistry, and Petrology Section of the American Geophysical Union.  Research initiatives  In her research, Shahar investigates how planets in the solar system formed and evolved through lab experiments that simulate the high temperature and pressure conditions that occur within Earth and other planets. She is the first person to perform stable isotope geochemistry experiments with high-temperature materials. Her lab group determines how these conditions alter the ratios of isotopes in different planetary materials. Shahar utilizes this method to understand planetary processes ranging from the formation of the first solids in the solar system, CAIs, to core formation. Shahar measured the silicon isotope fractionation during silicate and iron interaction in experiments that simulate the formation of a metallic core and surrounding mantle, such as occurred during Earth's formation. The experiments suggest that silicon may be one of the lighter elements that make up Earth’s core, along with iron and nickel. Shahar’s lab group also investigates how the presence of magnesium, sulfur, and nickel affect iron isotopic fractionation in planetary and asteroid materials.

She was born in Germany and emigrated to Argentina, arriving in May 1939: she never saw her parents again. Her own youngest daughter disappeared when aged 28 in August 1976. After that Ellen Marx became a prominent member of the German-Jewish community in Buenos Aires and a leader in the German originating group within the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo movement.  Life   Provenance and early years  Ellen Pinkus was born into a German-Jewish family in Berlin. She was her parents' only child. Isidor Pinkus, her father. was a leather wholesaler, and a committed democrat at a time when many Germans identified the new democratic regime as a foreign imposition resulting from military defeat and national humiliation. Her mother, born Gertrud Hoffnung, was a Social Democrat and a member of the German League for Human Rights. Ellen received a liberal Jewish education. She attended the prestigious \\"Prince Bismarck School\\" (as it was known at that time). In 1934 she joined the Berlin \\"Ring\\" scouting organisation which since 1933 had been part of the \\"League of German-Jewish Youth\\" (\\"Bund deutsch- jüdischer Jugend\\"). Traditionally the league organised Saturday meetings at which members could learn the revived Hebrew language and study Jewish history. There were also games and camping expeditions; but by the time Ellen joined the league's priority had become the organisation of escapes and foreign visas for those who, on account both of race and (at this stage) political activities, were being targeted by the government for persecution. The \\"League of German-Jewish Youth\\" was in turn was closely connected with the National Association of German-Jewish Citizens (\\" Central Verein\\" / CV).Jeanette Erazo Heufelder: Von Berlin nach Buenos Aires. Ellen Marx. Deutsch-jüdische Emigrantin und Mutter der Plaza de Mayo. Metropol Verlag, Berlin 2014, The family traced their German roots back at least two centuries. Ellen's great grandfather had been granted citizenship (at a time when German Jews did not automatically qualify for it) because he had fought valiantly in the armies confronting Napoleon at the start of the nineteenth century. There was pride in German culture, and before 1933 not too much reason to consider themselves politically or socially separated from other Germans. Even though she would spend most of her life living in a Spanish speaking country, when looking for literary quotes it was to Schiller and Goethe that she would always instinctively turn. At the same time, her Social Democratic mother would have shunned the shrill nationalism that had become a feature of political life since 1919. The Nazis had taken power early in 1933 and rapidly transformed Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Antisemitism was integrated into public policy and became progressively more oppressive for those affected. After the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938 Isidor Pinkus lost his customers. The day after the pogrom she was handed a letter at school addressed to her father from the mayor of Berlin in which Ellen's father was requested to remove her from the school. One teacher called her aside and whispered that he wished her \\"all the best\\", while other teachers and fellow- pupils looked away. For Jewish pupils, exclusion from the school turned out to be permanent. She never had an opportunity to sit for her school final exams (Abitur), and despite later attempts to catch up after she had left Germany, she would never succeed in completing her schooling.  Escape to Argentina  For the first few years of the Nazi regime, arrests and detentions of Jews had been restricted to the overtly politically engaged, but during the (exceptionally cold) winter of 1938/39 a large number of working age Jewish men in Berlin were arrested and placed in labour camps. Those who persuaded the authorities they intended to leave Germany would be released after six weeks: others were used for forced labour. The Gestapo came for Ellen's father on 10 December 1938 but he was out: as they left, the arresting officers passed Isidor Pinkus as he came home, but they did not recognise him and he naturally ignored them. Ellen's mother saw the encounter from the window of their apartment, and made arrangements to hide her husband with her 85-year- old father, at the same time starting to plan her 18-year-old daughter's emigration. She herself was unwilling to emigrate because it would have been necessary to leave her own father behind. Regulations meant that they would have been forced to leave their money and other worldly goods (apart from ten Marks) behind in Germany. Isidor Pinkus, more simply, \\"felt too old to start form the beginning again somewhere else\\". Ellen's emigration was part of a larger scale children's emigration programme organised by the CV. Jewish associations had been banned and meetings of more than two or three would have attracted suspicion from the authorities, but if people took care to visit one another only in ones and twos, and not to coincide with other visitors, enough communication to organise the escape became possible, without attracting Gestapo intervention. Three batches of children were collected together to be transported by train to the Aachen frontier point (and from there to Paris). The first batch had been granted entry visas by Brazil, but by the time it came to the second batch the Brazilian quota had been filled up. Assurances were received, however, that in return for payment, the Argentinian government would provide entry visa for the second and third batches - approximately 60 children and young people. It was forbidden for Jews to take significant amounts of money out of Germany, but Isidor Pinkus was able to give effect to the Argentinian entry fee on Ellen's behalf by contacting a kinsman in Palestine who owned a bank and made the payment. The third batch of refugee children, which included Ellen, left Berlin on 13 April 1939. Her mother and grandfather said their farewells on the station platform. Her father could not bear to come to the station and stayed home. Travelling via Paris and Le Havre on a cargo ship the children reached Buenos Aires on 25 May 1939, the day of Argentina's May Revolution Holiday. During the ocean crossing one stage she contracted polio, a common infection among the European refugees starting off near the bottom of the social pyramid: the disease was untreated, and although she recovered she would be left with a permanent stoop. The Jewish Colonization Association (HICEM) in Paris had successfully organised French exit visas, but had been able to provide the children with entry visas only for Bolivia, so the refugees stayed on the boat for several more days, fearful of being sent back to Europe, until a Jewish Aid organisation succeeded in obtaining entry visas for Argentina and Ellen Pinkus was able to begin her new life. The small bag her mother had packed for her with clothes and basic medications disappeared her first night ashore. In Buenos Aires Ellen Pinkus worked, initially, as a nanny in the Recoleta quarter. Responsibilies include attempting to teach the English language to her employers' two-year old infant. After five months her (Catholic) employers visited a relative who was a novice nun, and who pointed out that the new nanny was Jewish, so she was dismissed. There followed another job with a French family with whom duties included looking after the five children, cleaning the house, and preparing meals appropriate to her employers' \\"exquisite French palettes\\". That was followed by work as an assistant in a care-home founded by a Jewish doctor. The hours were shorter, but she was still only 18 and there were some unanticipated challenges, including teaching reading to a Down syndrome sufferer and looking after an elderly lady with cancer. Later in 1940 she accepted a position as a Kindergarten assistant at a children's home operated by the \\"Asociación Filantropia Isrealita\\" (AFI), founded by a long-established Jewish merchant family in Buenos Aires in anticipation of the flow of Jewish refugees from Europe.  Family developments and community involvement  At a musical evening held by the \\"Jewish Cultural Association\\" in the Buenos Aires quarter of Belgrano she met a pianist called Erich Marx, a German-Jewish refugee like herself. He had studied piano and voice at Mainz and in 1935 followed his brother to Argentina. His parents were murdered at Theresienstadt. On 11 March 1942 Erich Marx and Ellen Pinkus were married. By 1964 the marriage would have produced four children. Long before that new began to come through about relatives who had remained in Germany. During 1942/43 a message on the edge of one of the anodyne postcards that her mother was able to send stated \\"Frau Pinkus ist jetzt ganz alleine\\" (\\"Mrs. Pincus is now quite alone\\"). Her mother's postcards stopped after Gertrud was arrested and transported to Auschwitz, used for forced labour, and then, a year or so later, killed by gassing. Although a steady trickle of grim news emerged during the war years, it was only many years later that Ellen Marx learned in greater detail of father's death in Berlin in July 1942, of her mother's final years, and of the fates of nine other relatives who had been \\"hauled-off\\" by the authorities in Germany. Three of the couple's four children were born in 1943, 1947 and 1948. Between the births Ellen Marx taught German at the Pestalozzi School which had been founded on the north side of the city in 1934 by Ernesto Alemann. Most of the pupils were from Jewish families that had fled Germany and Austria. As her own children became less full-time, for around twenty years she found enormous satisfaction from helping to look after children with the Lamroth Hakol Community (loosely: \\"Despite everything community\\"), established in 1944 by and for German-Jewish refugees. The immediate priority was to teach the children Spanish. During the early 1950s she met many badly traumatised children whose parents' had survived the Shoa. Most had arrived via a large displaced persons' camp near Ulm where 7,000 holocaust survivors had been gathered together. During the 1960s Ellen Marx recovered her German nationality, but she did not return. Nor did she emigrate to Israel, though many did including, during the course of that decade, Miriam and Daniel, her two eldest children. During the 1950s and 1960s there was plenty of anti-Semitism to contend with on the streets of Peronist Argentina, although there was no question of this receiving government support. It was Miriam's emigration that prompted Ellen to visit the West German embassy and apply for a passport. But, just as with her father back in 1938, it was now Erich Marx who declared himself no longer able to go back to zero and start again. Although she lived in Argentina for the rest of her life, Ellen Marx remained steeped in German culture, and according to the international human rights lawyer Tonja Salomon, always spoke \\"wonderful\\" German. That was why Argentinian friends, with barely translatable irony, took to identifying her as \\"die Hiesigen\\" (\\"the local girl\\").  Nora  The third child of Erich and Ellen Marx, Nora, was born on 21 June 1948: unlike her elder siblings, Nora never showed any indication of wanting to live anywhere other than Argentina. As a school girl she was actively involved with the Argentinian Zionist youth movement. She attended the University of Buenos Aires, studying Meteorology, between 1966 and 1970. Her student career was in most respects unremarkable. She joined a welfare organisation called \\"Social Justice\\" which provided support classes for the children of disadvantaged families in the city's Mataderos slum quarters, as well as collecting unwanted second hand clothes and distributing them to the poor. After completing her studies, in 1971 Nora was hired as a civilian worker for the Argentine Air Force for work that involved airport security. She joined the Air workers' trades union (\\"Sindicato del Personal Civil y Técnico Argentino del Aire\\" / ATEPSEA) and became a union activist. She also remained active as a member of the \\"Social Justice\\" organisation.  1976  A military coup d'état overthrew the Perón government in 1976. As the generals consolidated their hold on power some 30,000 people were disappeared or killed. Three months after the military take-over a decree was promulgated making it possible for public service workers to be removed instantly from their jobs without justification. The union activist Nora Marx lost her job two weeks later. A couple of months after that, on the evening of Saturday 21 August 1976, Nora arranged to meet up with friends to go to the cinema. At around 8 in the evening Ellen Marx received a 'phone call from her daughter's boyfriend, asking if Nora was still at home. She was not. Ellen had been out since mid-afternoon so did not know when Nora had left the house. Nora was never seen again. Two weeks after the disappearance her parents received a telephone call: the caller did not give his name, but he conveyed greetings from Nora and said that she hoped to see her parents soon. Nothing further came of that, however. Witness statements obtained long afterwards indicate that she probably had not survived the serious torture inflicted by her captors during the first week or so after she was taken. Although the full extent and nature of the disappearances that occurred after the army took power emerged only little by little, people already knew enough for Ellen Marx to have been desperately worried by her daughter's unexplained disappearance. She looked everywhere and asked everyone she could think of for evidence of her daughter's whereabouts. She went to all the police stations in the area. Everyone she asked said they knew nothing about what had happened to Nora. The police stations she visited included Police station number 42 in the Mataderos quarter. There she was assured that there were no detainees held in the police cells. It later transpired, from the testimony of a fellow detainee, that this was the police station to which Nora was taken following her capture and where, with others, she was held and tortured for at least five days. Eventually Ellen Marx was reconciled to the probability that Nora was dead, but she never stopped trying to find out more about what had happened, though many details remain uncertain. It appears that Nora Marx was captured by \\"security personnel\\" between 16.00 and 19.00 on Saturday 21 August 1976. According to one version, Nora Marx was one of several people detained in a workshop used to make tote bags. The workshop also contained a printing machine and towards the end of that Saturday afternoon Nora Marx, with others, had gone to use that machine \\"to print leaflets\\". Another version has it that during the afternoon she was in the area of, or visiting, offices of the \\"Social Justice\\" organisation in Mataderos, with which she was still involved. Unbeknown to Nora, several days earlier the office had been occupied by government security officials, who then set about detaining anyone who entered the building. One of those detained had recognised and identified Nora, which had led to her arrest. The security officials involved were later determined to have been members of the so-called \\"First corps of the armed forces\\" (\\"Primer cuerpo de las fuerzas armadas\\"), commanded by Guillermo Suárez Mason, who during the 1980s and 1990s would face a succession of prosections, extraditions and convictions, along with a presidential pardon, in connection with his Dirty War crimes under the 1976-1983 dictatorship.  Later years  The military government collapsed in 1983, after which it became easier to investigate what had happened to victims of the Dirty War and to pursue some level of justice. Shortly after Nora disappeared Ellen Marx had become a member of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo movement. She was one of the women who at some stage during 1977 began to appear in the Plaza de Mayo, directly in front of the presidential palace, participating in silent demonstrations which involved holding up posters of their missing children with the slogan \\"¿Dónde están?\\" (\\"Where are they?\\"). As the silent demonstrations drew international interest the protestors themselves faced increased danger from the government. Their spokeswoman, Azucena Villaflor, was herself disappeared on 10 December 1977. The campaigners understood that international awareness was one of their most powerful tools. Argentina was an immmigrant nation, home to millions who had emigrated, or whose parents had emigrated, from different European countries. Ellen Marx had herself reinstated her (West) German citizenship as the nightmare Hitler years began to recede into history. The women made urgent representations to the embassies in Buenos Aires of the European countries from which they or their parents had emigrated. The West German embassy representatives were polite but, the women felt, spectacularly less helpful than embassy staff representing the other principal European countries involved. In Nora Marx's case they pointed out that since Nora herself did not hold a West German passport her disappearance was not a problem for them. The embassy appointed a man called \\"Major Peirano\\" as a liaison officer to \\"support\\" the women, but the parents came away with the strong impression that Peirano was procipally concerned to withhold any information to which he might have had access concerning the disappearances. He certainly did nothing to help find the disappeared children, giving rise to accusations afterwards that whereas the mothers at this stage knew only that their children were missing, West German embassy staff knew already that they had long since been murdered. After the military government collapsed and a form of democracy returned in 1983, a memorial tablet to Nora was set up in the Natural Sciences faculty at the university where she had studied. The Kaddish for Nora was delivered in Buenos Aires by Rabbi Rothschild. By 1983 Ellen Marx had realised that her daughter was almost certainly dead: the issue became one about truth and justice. She still needed to know what had happened and to see the killers punished. She and Idalina Tatter accepted now an invitation from Amnesty International and the Evangelical Churches in Germany to travel to West Germany. Idalina Tatter's German born husband Federico had, like Nora Marx, been disappeared. A third member of the deputation was Annemarie Zieschank from Argentina whose son, Klaus, was also missing. Controversially, from Ellen Marx's point of view, the German born Annemarie Zieschank had been a member of the Nazi party as a young woman. They made the trip as representatives of the families of the victims of the military dictatorship in Argentina, and arrived with a list of 72 people from the German-originating minority in Argentina who had disappeared during the dictatorship years. In West Germany Marx addressed the Evangelical Church Assembly, she spoke at press conferences and she addressed universities. Pointing out that she was a Jewess from Berlin she told her audiences: \\"You Germans know what an authoritarian regime is\\". She disparaged West Germany's diplomats in Argentina, contrasting their efforts with those of embassies representing countries such as Austria, Spain and Ireland, all of which had done a spectacularly better job of looking after their people. She was received by Willy Brandt who promised to help. Helmut Kohl, who had taken over as chancellor in 1982, expressed solidarity. Ellen Marx was keen to press criminal charges against the Argentine military. The civil rights lawyer Wolfgang Kaleck, who took on the case in the German courts, launched a case in 1999 on behalf of German-born victims of the military dictatorship in the Berlin district court, and later at the Nuremberg district high court. In the case of Nora Marx, however, the court decided it had no competence to hear the case, since the victim was not German. According to the final report of the commission set up by a later Argentinian government in respect of these matters, more than 12% of the thousands of disappeared under the military dictatorship were members of the Jewish community - many descended from German-Jewish emigrants - even though the overall proportion of the Argentine population identified as Jewish was a little under 1%. Ellen Marx continued to investigate human rights violations and crimes committed under the dictatorship for the rest of her life. Till shortly before she died she led the group of German-born mothers of the disappeared and the other victims. In January 2008, tend years after the death of her husband, Erich Marx, she died following a fall at the \\"Hogar Alfredo Hirsch\\" retirement home just outside Buenos Aires where, by that time, she was living. She had handed over family memorabilia to the Jewish Museum in Berlin.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. History The area around Huron City was first settled as part of the area's lumber boom, with a sawmill constructed at this location in the 1830s or 1840s. By 1852, P. F. Brakeman & Co. was operating a water- powered sawmill. Brakeman sold out to Dowling & Forbes of Port Huron, who sold to R. B. Hubbard & Co., a lumbering firm owned by Bloomfield, Connecticut brothers Langdon and Watson Hubbard and their cousin Rollin Barnard Hubbard; the company itself was based in Sandusky, Ohio. R. B. Hubbard & Co. managed a mill in Lexington, Michigan, and began developing their Huron City operation in the mid-late 1850s. By 1867, both Rollin and Watson Hubbard were working in Sandusky, leaving Langdon Hubbard in charge of the Huron City operations. By 1871, the Hubbard sawmill was reportedly producing 40,000 board feet of lumber per day, and a settlement had grown up around it. However, the Great Michigan Fire of 1871 completely destroyed the town. Hubbard rebuilt, and by 1875 the sawmill was rebuilt, and the village has a store, hotel, school, and houses. After the fire, Langdon Hubbard began obtaining rights to parcels in the village from the other Hubbard & Co. partners, and by 1881 effectively controlled the entire settlement. However, the 1881 Thumb Fire again entirely destroyed the village of Huron City, with Langdon Hubbard's losses reported at $50,000. Hubbard again rebuilt, constructing a grist mill, saw mill, boardinghouse, hotel, school, stores, and a number of houses. The sawmill was still in business, but local timber was scarce, and there was an influx of newcomers seeking farmland in the area, allowing Hubbard to sell what had previously been timberland. Langdon Hubbard died in 1892, and William H. Bennett took over the mill. However, without Hubbard, Huron City began to slowly wither. The hotel closed in 1901, the mill in 1903, and by 1907 there was only a single business in town. However, Hubbard's daughter Annabel had married William Lyon Phelps in 1892, and the couple summered in Huron City nearly every year until Annabel's death in 1938. The Phelpses owned nearly all of Huron City, and the village transformed from a declining mill town to a small rural hamlet, maintaining the former hotel as a community gathering place and re-landscaping portions of the village. After Annabel's death in 1938, Phelps turned over control of the town to his niece Carolyn Hubbard Parcells, who with her husband Charles began the project of preserving Huron City. In 1946 they established the William Lyon Phelps Foundation, which constructed a museum, and restored the general store and hotel. Description The Huron City Historic District contains a number of structures in the village, nearly all of which date to the mid-1880s rebuilding of the village after the Thumb Fire. It also contains two structures, the LaGassa Log House and the Point aux Barques U. S. Life-Saving Station Building, which have been moved from their original location to their current location. The structures are generally located along Pioneer Drive. Significant structures and locations, from west to east, include: * Cemetery: The cemetery covers a half acre of ground, and includes 12 marked graves, the earliest of which is of Langdon Hubbard. * Allen House: A 1-1/2 story, T-plan front-gable building with a one-story, side-gable wing to either side. The house is clad with clapboard and has paired front windows. It likely was constructed in the 1880s. * Hubbard Grist Mill site: A grist mill was constructed in this location in 1883, but there are no visible remnants. * Hubbard Saw Mill site: At least two sawmills, one built after the 1871 fire and the second built in 1883 occupied this site. Earlier mills may have been located at the same site. There are no visible remnants. * Langdon Hubbard General Store: The general store is a large, two-story, front-gable building, standing on a fieldstone foundation and covered with clapboard. A full-width one-story veranda runs across the front. The store sold a mixture of groceries/soft goods and hardware. * Pottenger House: This two-story, front- gable, clapboarded house was built in the 1880s. It was the home of William Pottenger, general manager of the town for the Phelpses. * Langdon Hubbard House: The Hubbard House is a T-shaped, two-story, cross-gable-roof structure with Gothic windows and bargeboards. A front veranda extends across the building. It was built in two sections, in 1881 and in 1886. * LaGassa Log House: This is a one-story, rectangular, gable-roof log cabin made of square- hewn, half-saddle-notched logs. It was constructed in the late 1830s or early 1840s by Mitchell and Delia LaGassa at a location along M-25 about two miles west of the present location. It was moved in 1922 to become a granary, and again in 1930 by Annabel Hubbard Phelps to her property to use as a tea house. It was moved again, to its present site, in 1958/60. * Hubbard Memorial Church: The church is a cross-gable-roof, clapboarded building with a symmetrical facade. It was originally constructed in 1883, and had substantial additions in the 1920s. * Lakeview House: The Lakeview House hotel, built in 1883-84. It is a two-story, front-gable building covered in clapboard, with a one-story veranda in front and a hip-roof, one-story, rear ell. It now serves as a museum. * Point aux Barques U. S. Life-Saving Station Building: This station was opened in 1876 at a site on the shore of the lake, about two miles east of the present location. It was moved to the present location in 1964 to preserve it. It is a wood-frame building constructed in two sections: a 1-1/2-story, gable-roof building which housed the life-saving apparatus and an attached 1-1/2-story dwelling with office for the station's captain.

It was the first \\"American blend cigarette\\" produced by a Swedish tobacco company. The mixture was produced by William c. Bethea who was hired by the Tobaksmonopolet in 1947.

The cars were constructed from 1998-2008 and replaced all remaining Boeing LRVs. They were built to have a low-floor section to allow for wheelchair accessibility. As of 2018, most cars are coupled to one Kinki Sharyo Type 7 in regular service to create a two-car train with one handicap accessible car. They run on all branches of the Green Line: B, C, D, and E. The MBTA currently runs 93 out of 96 Type 8 vehicles, numbered 3800 to 3894. They are maintained at the Reservoir and Riverside carhouses. History In 1996, the MBTA requested AnsaldoBreda make 96 new cars for the Green Line. The MBTA started running these cars in 1999, but they were very prone to derailment because of an incorrectly sized wheel axle and had to be taken out of service before returning in 2006. This delayed the retirement of the Boeing LRVs by several years. According to MBTA Chief Operating Officer Jeff Gonneville, they present a \\"maintenance challenge\\". They started tethering the Type 7s and Type 8s together to work with each other and making the wheels on the cars the same as the Kinki Sharyo Type 7s. In 1998, car numbers 3800 to 3802 were delivered are started testing in the summer of 1998 on the Riverside branch, then they went into service in March 1999. However the trains were removed from service several times, first time from August 2000 to June 2001, out of service completely in 2002, and eventually returning to service on the B branch in May 2003 because of derailment and axle size issues. The vehicles were first used in regular service on the B, C, and E branches. This is because these branches run in street medians or mixed traffic, generally operating at low speeds, while most problems with these cars happened at high speeds. The D branch, which is a grade-separated right-of-way, allows trains to reach higher speeds of 40 to 50 mph; therefore these cars were unable to run on the D branch until the tracks were fully rehabilitated in Summer 2007. Since then, Type 8 cars have run on all 4 branches of the Green Line since December 1, 2008. In May 2008, car number 3879 the A end was severely damaged from a derailment and eventually was stored at the Riverside yard until 2013. In January 2013, 3879 was fixed but was permanently retired and was moved to the new training facility in Broadway where it got preserved for training employees. In October 2016, the Boston Globe reported that the MBTA Green Line had the most derailments in the nation because of this train model. As of December 2019, car numbers 3847 and 3854 were retired from damages and are now stored for parts.  Features  Features include automated announcements, next stop signs, 75% low floor accessibility for wheelchairs, and white interior walls. The automated announcements and next stop signs were also retrofitted onto the Kinki Sharyo Type 7s. Like the rest of the MBTA system, the pre-recorded announcements were made by the voice of Frank Oglesby, Jr. The traction systems in these cars are similar to those used in the New York City Subway's R142A, R188 and R143 trains, as well as the entirety of the MARTA rail network in Atlanta.

Sadie Crawford, 1935 Based for the last 35 years of her life in Washington, D.C., United States, she was born Louisa Harriet Marshall in Tooting, London on 27 December 1885.Birth certificate (General Register Office, U.K.). The youngest of the seven children of Francis Thomas Marshall and his wife Ellen Maria, she maintained a close bond with her siblings and their families throughout her life. The household in which she grew up was a somewhat unconventional one: her father, a removal-man, died just before her fifth birthday,Death certificate (General Register Office, U.K.). and shortly afterwards her mother Ellen began a relationship with a man some 20 years her junior, Louis Slade, with whom in 1892 she went on to have one further child.Birth certificate (General Register Office, U.K.). Ellen and Louis finally married in 1905,Marriage certificate (General Register Office, U.K.). four years before Ellen’s death.Death certificate (General Register Office, U.K.). Most of Louisa’s siblings lived their adult lives in south London. Throughout her life she remained particularly close to her eldest sister Mrs Rhoda Matilda Newbon, who was mother to 13 children.See www.newbonfamilyhistory.com. Sadie took to the stage in London in her mid teens, and it is clear that early on she developed a taste for black popular culture, and music in particular. She would marry twice; both her husbands were black Americans. Numerous photographs show she presented herself as a 'black', 'coloured' or 'creole' woman and several newspaper articles also suggest that her origins were more exotic than they really were. Throughout her career she seems to have used professionally the forename Sadie, although the origins of this stage name are not known. Various sources allow us to piece together Sadie’s career. Not least among these is a short account of her life that she herself wrote in 1960 in her mid 70s.In a private family archive. From this we learn that she left school at 11 (working initially as a domestic servant) and within a few years was employed as a dancer at London’s Empire Theatre. Her first big break came with an invitation from the American entertainer Laura Hampton (née Bowman) to join her review troupe, following which she was signed up for a European tour of the show 'A Trip to Coontown'. Adolph and Sadie Crawford Sadie met her first husband, saxophonist Adolph Crawford, in 1906 and was soon working with him as a vaudeville music hall double act, although at this time she was using the name Sadie Johnson. In the years leading up to the First World War the duo can be found performing in Russia, Bucharest, the Balkan States and Scandinavia, as well as Berlin and Paris, and in the war years all corners of the United Kingdom. Sadie and Adolph finally married in Southwark in June 1918,Marriage certificate (General Register Office, U.K.). just as the jazz craze was sweeping across Europe. Their international careers started to take off in earnest at this time, with invitations to tour the world pouring in. In the post-war years they can be found as far afield as New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, in addition to Austria, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Paris, very much the European capital of jazz with so many resident and ad hoc bands and orchestras, became an important base for the duo. It was in Paris in 1923 that the few recordings to feature them (as part of Gordon Stretton’s ‘Orchestre Syncopated Six’) were made by Pathé; it was also at the American Hospital of Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, that Adolph Crawford died in 1929. Within a few months of Adolph's death Sadie sailed to New York City with Lew Leslie's ‘Blackbirds’ and it was in the United States that she thereafter settled. After suffering a nervous breakdown she was advised to go to Saratoga Springs to recuperate and it was there she met her second husband Frank Mozee (a chauffeur, some 16 years younger than she was), whom she married in 1930, when she would have been 44. Sadie and Frank made their home in Washington D.C. and it seems that her second marriage effectively marked the end of her stage career. From America she regularly visited her family back in Tooting (in the early years by boat but latterly by plane), staying at the Regent Palace Hotel in central London. Although she had no children of her own, Sadie was ‘foster mother’ to a daughter, Lillian Brown. Sadie Mozee (Sadie Crawford)This is the family copy of the image used for her obituary notice in the Evening Star (Washington), 21 December 1965. Sadie Mozee died at Washington’s District of Columbia General Hospital on 18 December 1965, a few days short of her 80th birthday, the Washington Evening Star revealing in her obituary notice that her death occurred ‘after a long illness’.Evening Star (Washington), 21 December 1965. The article also states that she was a member of St Martin’s Catholic Church and that she is buried in Washington's Mount Olivet Cemetery. Her husband Frank died in Washington D.C. in 1981. The plaque commemorating the house where Sadie Crawford was born and lived as a child in Tooting, London, UK On Saturday 16 June 2018, 53 years after her death, a blue plaque was erected on the house in which she was born and lived as a child in Tooting, London, the third in that area of the city. On that occasion it was announced that the nearby Streatham & Clapham High School was introducing an annual scholarship award, the Sadie Crawford Music Scholarship, in memory of her pioneering musical activity.

History This palace was built by Agostino Fraccia, baron of Favarotta and Furni since 1697,Pietro Francesco Mistretta: Il Vespro, Alcamo 24 marzo 1977 in order to have a mansion fitting to the new social position he had acquired from his noble family; it can certainly be considered one of the most beautiful civil buildings built in the 18th century in Alcamo.  Description  On the Baroque style façade there are eight entrances on the ground floor: the central one is full of decorations; the portal, made with travertine, owing to the restoration of the road, has a raised bottom with simple pedestals, two capitals and a lowered arch (finely decorated at its arrises), surmounted by two brackets with leaf and fruit decorations, supporting the balcony of honour.Roberto Calia: I Palazzi dell'aristocrazia e della borghesia alcamese; Alcamo, Carrubba, 1997 The portal of the balcony is also rich with baroque decorations, with two pilasters, other garnitures on both sides, ending with three masks, the biggest one in the middle; the family emblem dominates the tympanum: it is formed by a heart confixed by an arrow and surmounted by the baronial crown. The other five balconies on the first floor are made with carved stone; the brackets are fluted and have some decorations; on the second floor there are five stone balconies, two windows and two recent balconies. As soon as you enter the lobby, there is an atrium: today, of the two ancient staircases, there is only the one leading to the first floor; in the late 19th century they built another staircase leading up to the second floor. The palace is situated between the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari (along corso 6 Aprile) and via Porta Stella, where there are two other entrances on the first floor, leading to its eight rooms with accessories, and to the ten rooms existing on the second floor. The terrace dominates the Church, with a recent balcony which was added in the last century; during the 1950s the building has changed its ownership from the marquess Patti di Santa Rosalia to the families Manno, La Colla, Lucchese and Ippolito.

He previously worked as a Senior Fellow at Sentience Politics, and before that at Animal Charity Evaluators as chair of the board of directors, then as a full-time researcher. Anthis's research focuses on effective altruism, anti-speciesism, and plant-based and cellular agriculture. He was recognized as one of Vices \\"Humans of the Year\\" in December 2017, along with Witwicki. His book, The End of Animal Farming (2018), argues that animal farming will end by 2100. Education Anthis attended the University of Texas at Austin, graduating with a Bachelor of Science and Art degree in 2015.  Career  Before graduating, Anthis worked on the Animal Charity Evaluators Board of Directors; he joined them as a full-time researcher after graduation. Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE, formerly called Effective Animal Activism) is an organization within the effective altruism movement that evaluates and compares various animal charities based on their cost-effectiveness and transparency, particularly those that are tackling factory farming.Engber, Daniel (August 18, 2016) \\"Save the Chicken\\", Slate While at ACE, Anthis published an article that addressed the issue of wild animal suffering, arguing that humans should act on behalf of wild animals to alleviate their suffering if it can be done safely and effectively. His 2015 Vox article on the topic was criticized by writers who argued that humanity should not intervene or that it should instead focus on helping domestic animals.  Sentience Institute  After a year and a half at Animal Charity Evaluators, Anthis briefly worked with Sentience Politics, a project of the Effective Altruism Foundation. Sentience Politics then split into two organizations, one of which was the Sentience Institute, co-founded by Anthis and Kelly Witwicki in June 2017, Anthis and Witwicki married in 2020, after which she took his surname.  The End of Animal Farming  In The End of Animal Farming, Anthis \\"outlines an evidence-based roadmap to a humane, ethical, efficient food system where slaughterhouses are obsolete\\". Anthis wrote this book from the perspective of effective altruism because there is already much content explaining the problems of animal agriculture, but he perceived a need for a book to guide the \\"farmed animal movement\\" towards its long-term goal. Near the end of the book, Anthis concludes that, “if I had to speculate, I would say by 2100 all forms of animal farming will seem outdated and barbaric.” Selected works *(2018).

The site was discovered by a group of archaeologists, during an archaeological excavation done in the Sampur area in December 2017. However the ruins, including an old Stupa were completely destroyed and flattened out by a group of vandals on 18 December, few days after the discovery. Archaeological exploration During the Sri Lankan civil war, many of the archaeological sites in the North and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were not properly investigated or recorded as the prevailed threats from the LTTE rebel group. After the defeat of LTTE in 2009, the archaeology department carried out several projects across the North & Eastern provinces to investigate and identify the places with archaeological evidences and the some of places were finally declared as archaeologically protected reserves and monuments. As the instructions given by Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, a similar project was started after the 2015 to investigate the unknown archaeological sites in the Eastern province of the country. In December 2017, as a part of the project a group of archaeologists unearthed a dilapidated Stupa during an excavation done in a Hindu temple premises in Soodaikudah in Sampur. According to the initial evaluations done by the archaeologists, the Stupa is a construction of early Anuradhapura period (377 BC to 1017 AD) with a girth of 15 feet. Hindu shrine The ruins of the stupa were found on land which is used by a recently built Hindu shrine. The local people in Soodaikudah are said to be displaced in 2006 along with Muttur people and had been resettling around the area from 2013. The Hindu shrine, constructed near to the stupa mound, was officially registered in 2014. Destruction A few days after the identification, the Stupa mound had been cleared completely by a group of people using a bulldozer before the Department declared it as an archaeologically and historically important site. The destruction was first revealed by police who conducted investigations following a tip-off given on the police hotline. The incident was reported to the authorities including the Secretary to the President and the Eastern Province Governor by the chief monk of Seruvila Mangala Raja Maha Vihara. A police investigation was started following the incident and meanwhile a court order was issued by the Muttur magistrate, suspending all rehabilitation works on the Hindu temple. On 23 December, the speaker Karu Jayasuriya revealed that the people who destroyed the Soodaikudah Stupa in Sampur has been identified. A few days after the statement, three people were arrested with a bulldozer and a lorry which were used to destroy the Stupa. The bulldozer had been brought to the Hindu shrine to dig a drinking well around 100 metres away from the Kovil but they had used the vehicle to destroy the Stupa. Local media reported that the two drivers involved in the destruction of the Stupa had met with accidents at different places on the same day. On 29 December the Department of Archaeology announced that they will take over the entire land area, where the Sudaikuda Stupa was located for further preservation. In January police arrested three senior members of the Hindu temple board who had connected with the incident.

It is grows in clearings, mountain ridges and in forest margins, from tropical and temperate Asia, Australia and some islands in the Pacific Ocean. It has limited native medicinal uses. Description It has a creeping rhizome, covered with black shiny hairs,R.C. Cambie and J. Ash or reddish brown hairlike scales. The hairs are 4 to 5 mm long and 0.2 mm in diam. The hairs are more like bristles on the older sections of the rhizomes. It is up to 1 cm or more in diameter. It has Stipes (or stalks) that are between tall, which have hairlike scales at base, and then becomes smooth and glabrous. They are stramineous (straw coloured) to brown. The leaf stems appear at regular intervals along the rhizome. and branch three or four times, with 1 metre wide fronds, or lamina (leaf blades).F. O. Bower The mid green, or dark green fronds, but paler or glaucous underneath. are between long and wide. They are divided to the base into two spreading fan-shaped halves, which are further divided more than halfway into 4 or more unequal lobes, these lobes are again less deeply lobed once or more times. The ultimate lobes taper to a narrow apex with the edges deeply or coarsely toothed. The main veins are dichotomously branched several times. The veins on the fronds are also dichotomously-branched with 2–4 main veins entering each of the lobes. The juvenile fronds are tomentose (with a layer of downy hairs). On the lower surface of the fronds, are numerous, small sori (spore producers), they are irregularly scattered and of irregular size and shape. They do not have indusia (umbrella-like covers) and have paraphyses (filament-like support structures) which are club-shaped. Biochemistry The leaves contain 2 ent-kauranoid hydroxy acids.N.

Distribution and habitat Close-up of the leaf of the fern It is native to tropical and temperate Asia, Australia and some islands in the Pacific Ocean. Range It can be found in temperate Asia, within the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. In tropical Asia, within Papua New Guinea, Cambodia (mainly Kampot), Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Hainan (in China), Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia (including on the slopes of Mount Ophir,A. C. Seward ) and in the Philippines. Also within Queensland in Australia, and on the islands of New Caledonia, (of New Zealand) and Fiji. Within Thailand, it is found in the provinces of Surat Thani, Phangnga, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Trang and Yala. Within Singapore, it is found in the district of Kranji, Tanjung Gul and on the island of Pulau Tekong. Habitat D. conjugata grows on clay slopes, in clearings, ridges and on forest margins. In East Kalimantan, Indonesia, it grows along rivers together with Nypa Palms. In Borneo, it is found commonly growing with Histiopteris incisa (Thunb.) J. Sm. and Lygodium circinnatum (Burm.) Sw., along forest margins and paths. In New Caledonia, it is found on sunny roadside banks. The fern is also common in forest margins in high rainfall areas. The species occurs mainly at altitudes of above sea level in China, in Malaysia, and in Singapore. In Singapore, it occurs on coastal cliffs, and at the risk of landslides. It is also Conservation Dipteris conjugata is listed as Critically Endangered, in the 2008 Singapore Red Data Book. In Labrador Nature Reserve in Singapore, a large historic fern population was decimated, when the reserve was downgraded to a nature park to only a few plants left in 2001. It has also been found in Tanjong Berlayar Park in Singapore.Raffaella Sini Peter K. L. Ng, Richard Corlett and Hugh T. W. Tan (editors) To help conserve this fern, staff from the National Biodiversity Centre regularly check on the growth of the Dipteris in the Western Water Catchment. Using parangs and secateurs, they prune and clear the plants that may damage the fern, such as the invasive weed, Simpuh Air (Dillenia suffruticosa), the Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina), and the Resam (fern) (Dicranopteris linearis). Elsewhere in other areas, at has been assessed as Least Concern (LC), as this species is widespread and not under any known threat. Cultivation D.conjugata in Cibodas Botanical Garden, Indonesia It is sometimes planted as an ornamental plant in Singapore. It can grown in poor to well drained soils and is mostly disease and pest resistant. Also specimens of the plant can be found in Cibodas Botanical Garden in West Java of Indonesia, and in the Fernarium of Univerisiti Kebangsaan in MalaysiaV. H.

He is best known for his role in the development of the Romanized Popular Alphabet for the Hmong language. Noble, Holcomb B. (1997). 'William Smalley, 74, Linguist for the Hmong'. The New York Times, December 26. Life Early life William A. Smalley was born in 1923 in Jerusalem, where his parents worked as missionaries of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. He and his family remained there until 1934, at which time they returned to the United States.Wang, Lorain (2008). 'Register to the Papers of William A. Smalley'. National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution. In 1941, he matriculated in Houghton College,Smalley, William A. (1991). 'My Pilgrimage in Mission'. International Bulletin of Missionary Research, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 70-73. where he developed an interest in anthropology, which he saw as relevant to missionary work. After graduating from Houghton in 1945 with a degree in English literature, he attended the Missionary Training Institute (1945-46) and received linguistic training in Bible translation at the Summer Institute of Linguistics at the University of Oklahoma (1946, 1947). In 1946, he also enrolled in Columbia University's graduate program in anthropology with an emphasis on linguistics. Vietnam and Laos In 1950, the Christian and Missionary Alliance sent him to the southern region of Vietnam, where he worked on problems of language analysis. The following year, he was sent to Luang Prabang in Laos in order to analyse Khmu and prepare lessons in the language for other missionaries. In Laos, he met Reverend G. Linwood Barney and Father Yves Bertrais, and together they began working on a writing system for the Hmong language, which had until then been unwritten. The system they developed became known as the Romanized Popular Alphabet, and it is today the most widely used Hmong writing system. Yang Dao, the assistant director of the English Language Learner Project of the St. Paul Public Schools, has said: \\"I cannot value his work. … It is invaluable. This writing system helped us to preserve our culture and tradition and history. Now it is used by Hmong all over the world.\\" In 1954, the outbreak of the Laotian Civil War forced him and his wife to return to the United States. There he completed his dissertation on the Khmu language, for which he was awarded a doctorate by Columbia in 1956.

The nature of his work meant that he twice took up residence in Thailand, first from 1962 to 1967 and then again from 1969 to 1972. He was the editor of Practical Anthropology (now known as Missiology) from 1955 to 1968 and an associate editor of The Bible Translator from 1957 to 1959. In 1977, after twenty-three years with the American Bible Society and United Bible Societies, he decided to leave. Unable to find employment, he worked for a time at a discount toy store. Bethel University In 1978, he relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota, to accept a position as Professor of Linguistics at Bethel University. To his surprise, he discovered that many thousands of Hmong refugees were also settling in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. As an Honorary Fellow with the University of Minnesota Southeast Asia Refugee Studies Program, he took part in a project studying Hmong adaptation to life in the United States, publishing 'Adaptive Language Strategies of the Hmong: From Asian Mountains to American Ghettos' (1985) and 'Stages of Hmong Cultural Adaptation' (1986). He also studied the different Hmong scripts that had been developed after the Romanized Popular Alphabet, in particular the Pahawh Hmong script, which was created in Laos in 1959 by Shong Lue Yang. With Chia Koua Vang and Gnia Yee Yang, he wrote two books about Pahawh Hmong and its creator: Mother of Writing: The Origin and Development of a Hmong Messianic Script and The Life of Shong Lue Yang: Hmong “Mother of Writing” (both published in 1990).Bright, William (1998). 'Appreciation: William A. Smalley (1923-1997)'. LSA Bulletin, No. 159, pp. 10-11. From 1983 to 1992, he was an associate editor of Language Sciences. In 1985 and 1986, he once again lived in Thailand, this time as a Fulbright research fellow researching the different languages and dialects of the country. His book Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand (1994) has been described by the Thai scholar David Smyth as \\"a masterful study of the relationship between the national language, regional dialects and minority languages\\".Smyth, David (2002).

History Background Map of the then walled city of Erfurt, 1730, showing Petersberg Citadel in the top western part of the city. Petersberg Citadel is entwined with the history of Erfurt. The city was first mentioned in 742 in a letter from St Boniface to Pope Zachary, when the Catholic Diocese of Erfurt was established.Heinemeyer, Karl (2004). Bonifatius: Heidenopfer, Christuskreuz, Eichenkult. Erfurt: Stadtverwaltung Erfurt. It was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and was brought into the Diocese of Mainz in 755. The earliest archaeological find from the Middle Ages on Petersberg hill is a coin dating from c.850, from the time of Lothair I, Holy Roman Emperor from 817 to 855. It was found in a grave, in the mouth of the deceased.Stadt Erfurt. Archäologischer Wanderführer Thüringen. Weimar: Landesamt für Archäologie, 2005 The oldest surviving building in the citadel is the Peterskirche (St. Peters Church), which was part of the Benedictine Monastery of St Peter and Paul, after which the hill, and subsequently the citadel, was named. The first recorded evidence of the monastery is from 1060, but it may have existed a considerable time before that.Stadtverwaltung Erfurt Kirchen in Erfurt: Peterskirche. Retrieved 26 December 2017 The original building burned down in 1080, but was rebuilt from 1103 to 1147 and St Peter's Church is from this second period. In 1184, the Erfurt latrine disaster occurred in this building, where a meeting of nobles from around the Holy Roman Empire fell through the floor into the latrine, with at least 60 drowning. The city gradually grew more independent during the 12th century, and in 1217 it became fully independent with the founding of its own city council. From 1066 until 1873 the old town of Erfurt was encircled by a fortified wall. About 1168 this was extended to run around the western side of Petersberg hill, enclosing it within the city boundaries.Stadtverwaltung Erfurt (4 September 2012). Stadtbefestigung einst und jetzt. Retrieved 28 December 2017 About 1625 the city council had the city wall at the Petersberg strengthened by building a large hornwork and two bastions. These are the bastions named Gabriel and Michael. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), Erfurt was occupied by Swedish forces from 1631. The Swedish king, Gustav II Adolf, hoped to build a fortress on Petersberg hill, but he died in 1632 and the plans never came to fruition. However, the Swedes did strengthen the existing Bastion Gabriel in 1643. In 1664 the city and the surrounding area were conquered by the Electorate of Mainz. On 1 June 1665 the foundation stone of Petersberg Citadel was laid. Building of the citadel The formal first construction phase lasted from 1665-1707, following an order from Johann Philipp von Schönborn (1605-1673), Archbishop-Elector of Mainz and Bishop of Würzburg and Worms, to build the citadel. Von Schönborn had recently conquered Erfurt and wanted to build the fortress to demonstrate his power to the local population, in order to suppress any ideas of rebellion.Raßloff, Steffen (16 May 2015).Zitadelle Petersberg. Retrieved 28 December 2017 A plan that the Erfurt architect :de:Caspar Vogel (c.1660-1663) had created for the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf served as a basic model for the citadel, and the work was substantially influenced by :de:Antonio Petrini (c.1620-1701) the architect to the imperial court of Mainz.Raßloff, Steffen (5 October 2013).Caspar Vogel:Ein großer Baumeister. Retrieved 28 December 2017 This included the building of the walls, bastions, the ravelins called Anselm and Lotha, the main gateway (Peterstor) and commandant building, three barracks, which are among the oldest surviving barracks in Germany, and the tunnels within the walls, called Horchgänge in German, meaning the 'listening passages'.Kürsten, O. (1943). Der Petersberg: die Akropolis von Erfurt. Gotha: Engelhard-Reyher-VerlagMoritz, Horst (2001). Die Festung Petersberg unter Kurmainz 1664–1802. Erfurt: Stadtmuseum Erfurt The second construction phase was from 1707 to 1728, under the direction of the architect Maximilian von Welsch (1671-1745), who was made an imperial knight with the title Edler von Welsch for his services to architecture by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in 1714. Welsch put special emphasis on the reinforcement of the fortress and trench defenses. Erfurt became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802, to compensate Prussia for its territories on the left bank of the Rhine that were lost to France. However, on 16 October 1806 Erfurt was handed over to French forces in what is known as the Capitulation of Erfurt, which followed the Prussian defeat in the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt.

French troops were stationed at Erfurt from 1806 to 1814, when Erfurt was under Napoleonic occupation. Napoleon arrived in the city on 23 June 1807, and created the Principality of Erfurt, which he ruled directly himself. Napoleon visited Erfurt a number of times during the French occupation. He took a particular interest in Petersberg Citadel.Kaiser, Klaus-Dieter (2007). Erfurt als Garnison und Festung 1813-1873. Berlin: Klaus-Dieter Kaiser. He stayed in Erfurt from 27 September to 14 October 1808, when he meet with Tsar Alexander I of Russia for the Congress of Erfurt.Unsere Leben - unsere Stadt. Erfurt Tourismus und Marketing, 2017 The two leaders visited Petersberg Citadel together during the Congress.Erfurt, Capitial of Thuringia. Erfurt Tourismus und Marketing, 2013. He also went to Erfurt on 15 December 1812 on his return from Russia to France, and from 25–28 April 1813. On 21 April 1813 he had ordered that Petersberg Citadel should be strengthened and equipped so that it could support 2000 men under siege for six months. Both French troops and civilian residents of Erfurt were put to work on the project, with over 3000 civilians working on building the ditches that surround the external walls. The work was carried both day and night, used flaming torches to see by. During this time a hidden trench connecting Petersburg and Cyriaksburg citadels was built, the remains of which can still be seen at Cyriaksburg today. On 4 November 1813 Prussian, Austrian and Russian forces drew in on Erfurt and sought to get the French to surrender and leave Petersberg Citadel. There was no surrender and fire was opened on the citadel on 6 November, at six o'clock in the morning. A number of buildings caught fire, including the main guardhouse, monastery building, and parts of St. Peter's Church. One hundred and twenty-one houses in the town centre below the citadel were also destroyed. The French didn't surrender, but there was an extended truce and at the beginning of January 1814, the city of Erfurt was handed over to the Prussians, although the French troops remained in the Petersberg and Cyriaksburg citadels. When Paris was captured by allied troops in April 1814, the Napoleonic troops still remained in Petersberg citadel. It was not until 5 May 1814 that French Field Marshal Alexandre Dalton surrendered and handed the citadel over peacefully to the Prussians. Prussian rule (1814-1871) Caponier I, built 1824/25, between the citadel wall and Ravelin Anselm When the Prussians took back the citadel in 1814, they began a new building phase which lasted until 1868. They wanted to make the fortress \\"bomb proof\\", and resilent to the strength of the latest weapons. During this period they built the Defence Barracks, the fortress bakery, wells, latrines, and caponiers. A caponier is part of a fortification built in a ditch to provided covered defence to the ditch and/or access to outer parts of the fort. German Empire (1871-1918) After German Unification in 1871, Erfurt became part of the newly created German Empire. The threat to the city from its Saxon neighbours and from Bavaria was no longer present, so it was decided to dismantle the city walls. Only a few remnants remain today. In June 1873 Emperor Wilhelm I gave orders for the Petersberg and Cyriaksburg citadels to be pulled down, but due to lack of funds this was mostly not done. Two ravelins (Peter and Wilhelm) and the hornwork along the walls were removed. An access road was built and Lunette I was demolished and Lunette II and Ravelin Gabriel were reduced in height. The rubble was used to fill in the ditches.Moritz, Horst (2002). Die Festung Petersberg unter Preußen 1802–1918. Erfurt: Stadtmuseum Erfurt Prior to World War I there was a renewed interest in the strategic military location of Petersberg Citadel. New buildings, such as workshops, warehouses, barracks and a military detention centre were built between 1912 and 1914. Post World War I The fortress remained an important garrison position until the end of the war in 1918. After World War I, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, there was a gradual abandonment of military facilities during the Weimar Republic period. Petersberg was used for garden allotments and by the civil police, who had a detention centre, garages, workshops and stores on the site.  Nazi period (1933-1945)  Detention centre, built 1912-1914, where political opponents were held by the Nazis. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, they again brought the citadel into military use. They built gun casemates, and from 1935 divisional army units, reserve army units and the district army recruitment office were based there. Also from 1935, the Nazis used parts of the citadel as a prison for the internment of their political enemies, such as communists and trade unionists. They were kept in a police detention centre originally built to accommodate up to 60 prisoners, but at its peak 241 internees were crowded into the facility. Many of the internees were sent directly from Petersberg citadel to concentration camps. Some were murdered by the Nazis at the citadel itself. The Nazis also had a military court at the citadel for dealing with people such as deserters, which could pronounce death sentences on those being tried, and sometimes these people were immediately executed at the citadel. Today there is a memorial to those mistreated by the Nazis at the site. Some war damage was sustained, including the 12th century Leonhardskirche (St Leonard's Church) which was totally destroyed in an air raid. The church had been converted into an artillery store. Post World War II At the end of World War II, Erfurt was liberated by American forces in April 1945, and handed over to the Soviet administration on 3 July 1945, as agreed at the Yalta Conference, held in February 1945. In 1944 a transit camp for displaced people had been established in the Defense Barracks, and this continued operating under the occupying Soviet administration after the war. In 1949 the Soviet Occupied Zone became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). From 1947 Peterberg Citadel was used mainly for civil purposes, with barracks being used by the civil police. From 1956 until 1963 the East German Army (German: Nationale Volksarmee) used the citadel and its barracks, but they then moved to new facilities on the outskirts of the city. After that the main users of site were the police, for storing equipment, and a garden allotment association. The Stasi, whose prison and district headquarters were immediately below the citadel, had warehouses and workshops on the site for their motor pool until 1990. The rest of the citadel was unused and plants were allowed to naturally regrow. Restoration After German reunification in 1990, a massive project to restore the citadel was begun. It is the largest such project undertaken by the Erfurt city council and it is funded by the city council and the Thuringian state and German federal governments. Over 300 people were temporarily employed. Most buildings added since 1868 were removed, most earlier buildings, including the 12th century St Peter's Church, were restored or stabilised, ditches were cleared and walls and bastions were repaired, the horchgänge (listening passages) were cleared, and the 1832 wood- fired fortress bakery was brought back into working order. As at January 2018, the restoration is still on-going. Main buildings and structures Walls Stone walls, Petersberg Citadel The citadel is surround by 2,180 metres of stone walls, which were erected in the first building phase, beginning in 1665. They form the star-shaped ground plan of the citadel, made with eight bastions and four ravelins and are between 1.2 and 6 metres thick, and from 8 to 26 metres high. There are small look-out towers built into the walls. There are now only three ravelins as Ravelin Wilhelm was removed in the 19th century. There are tunnels within the walls, called the Horchgänge in German, meaning the 'listening passages'. At the time the citadel was first built there were no trenches or moats beyond the wall, so the Horchgänge were constructed so that soldiers could walk through them to listen for anyone trying to tunnel into the fortress. Gate and Commandant Building (Peterstor & Kommandantenhaus) Main Gate and Commandant building, 2014 The Peterstor, the main entrance to the citadel, was built from 1666-1668. It was designed by Antonio Petrini and bears the coat of arms of Johann Philipp von Schönborn (1605-1673), the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz. In 1993 the two wooden portcullis were reconstructed within the double archway entrance. The script above the gateway which reads \\"Citadelle Petersberg\\", was installed in 1861. The Commandant Building was built in 1669 by an Italian construction team. From 1939 to 1945 it was used as a military court by the Nazis. It was restored in 1998 and is now used by Tanztenne Petersberg, a dance school for traditional Thuringian folkdancing.Tanztenne Petersberg. Retrieved 3 January 2018 St Peter's Church (Peterskirche) St Peter's Church built 1103-1147 The Peterskirche, the 75 metre-long monastery church, was built between 1103 and 1147. It originally had two towers at its east end, which along with the towers of the Erfurt cathedral and the Severikirche, dominated the city skyline. Until the end of the 13th century, Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and German kings often held court in the church. Church synods also took place there. In November 1181 an Imperial Diet was held in the church, presided over by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, known as Barbarossa. There Barbarossa's cousin Henry the Lion submitted to the emperor's authority after several years of opposition and war, and ceded most of his lands. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) Erfurt was occupied from 1631 by the troops of Gustav II Adolf of Sweden. In 1632, the Swedes briefly dissolved the monastery and temporarily converted it into a Protestant monastery in 1633. After the occupation only three monks remained. The church was damaged and the treasures and stores of the monastery were plundered. The damage to the church was repaired in the first and second building phases of citadel, in 1672 and 1727. In 1765 its interior was baroqueized by Italian plasterers.Stiftung Thüringer Schlösser und Gärten (2004). 700 Jahre Erfurter Peterskloster: Geschichte und Kunst auf den Erfurter Petersberg 1103–1803. Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner In 1803 the monastery was secularised. On 6 November 1813 Prussian troops bombarded the French occupied citadel and much of it caught fire, including the church and monastery buildings. The monastery buildings, other than the church, were later then completely removed by Prussian forces who took possession of citadel in May 1814. From 1820 the remaining church was used as a store for flour and military provisions. The towers were dismantled, a new roof was built and three storage levels were constructed inside. In spite of these alterations, the building still has traces of medieval and baroque architectural details, sculpture and paintwork, and the monumental size of the building can still be appreciated. Since 1993 the church has been used as an exhibition space for international concrete art, i.e. art which places a strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction. It has nothing to do with concrete, the building material. Defense Barracks (Defensionkaserne) Defense Barracks, 2014 The Defense Barracks, by far the largest building on Petersberg Citadel, was built from 1828 to 1831 by the Prussian administration, on the site of the former monastery building which had been damage by fire in 1813 and later demolished. The building is 167 metres long and 18.8 metres wide. The external walls are up to 2 metres thick. It could accommodate approximately 500 soldiers and was built primarily as an artillery position to hinder enemy access to the upper plateau of the citadel from the north. After the unification of Germany in 1871, the building was mainly used for housing soldiers and for storage. In 1912-1913 it was remodelled and expanded with a neo-Baroque style mansard roof and the addition of large dormer windows on both sides of the building. After this it was then able to accommodate 750 soldiers. After the end of World War I in 1918, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, there was gradual decline in use of military facilities in Germany. The barracks was used as residential building and as quarters for the civil police and the Freikorps Thüringen, a civilian militia army unit. During the rearmament of the army during the Nazi period, there was renewed military use of Petersberg citadel. From 1936 to 1938 part of the barracks was used to house the new established Motorized Infantry Regiment no. 71, and from 1938 to 1939 as the headquarters of the army's administrative offices. In 1944 a transit camp for displaced people was established in the Defense Barracks, and this was continued by the occupying Soviet administration after the war. When the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded in 1949, the citadel again was used by the military. The Defense Barracks was used to accommodate a police school, the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (a precursor to the Nationale Volksarmee - NVA), and after 1956 newly formed NVA. After 1963 the citadel became the property of the city of Erfurt and the Defense Barracks were used for storage. It has been vacant since 2000 and there is on going discussion about how it will ultimately be restored and used. Barracks A (Kaserne A) Barracks A, 2014 Barracks A was built in 1675. The 94 meter long building is a terrace of four houses with separate entrances and a central portal providing access to a back courtyard. It was used as a barracks until the end of World War I in 1918. After that it was used for civilian housing. From 1935-1945 it housed the Wehrbezirkskommando (District military command headquarters). From 1945 it was an old people's home. The building was restored between 2000-2001 and it now houses a mixture of private apartments and offices.Zitadelle Petersberg Verwaltung (c.2010). Site Information. Lower Barracks (Untere Kaserne) The Lower Barracks was built c.1690. It now houses the Stasi Records Agency, officially the Bundesbeauftragt für die Stasi-Unterlagen (BStU).

It remains the deadliest Tu-124 crash and regular passenger services with the Tu-124 were permanently suspended after the accident, but the Tu-124 was still used by the Soviet military after the accident.  Aircraft and crew  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-124V powered by two Soloviev D-20P engines, registered as CCCP-45038 to the Privolzhsk Civil Aviation Directorate of Aeroflot. At the time of the accident the aircraft had flown 23,232 flight hours and sustained 18,369 pressurization cycles. The five crew members that were aboard the flight consisted of a captain, co-pilot, navigator, flight engineer and one flight attendant.  Synopsis  Flight 5484 departed from the stopover at Kyiv-Boryspil Airport on August 28 at 23:21 Moscow time (22:21 local time) with five crew members and 58 passengers aboard, including five children. The night was clear with visibility ranging from . After takeoff the flight climbed to a cruising altitude of and maintained a speed of . At 00:23 the flight contacted Penza air traffic control to report entering their airspace. That was the last time the flight made contact with controllers. The flaps were extended for unknown reasons at 00:24:35 while the Tu-124 was at a speed of and flying at a heading of 65°. The crew immediately noticed the aircraft began to lose altitude and they switched off the autopilot at 00:24:43. The flaps did not retract and the position of the flaps led to the aircraft descending quickly; the crew pulled on the control column in attempt to level the aircraft, which levelled briefly before the aircraft went into a roll. The force on the control column was weakened at 00:24:52, and thereafter the flaps fully extended to 30° putting the aircraft in a steep dive that quickly exceeded the aircraft maximum safe speed of . At 00:25:13, less than a minute after the flaps were extended, the aircraft was at an altitude of and flying at a speed of with a rate of descent of , the inboard flap tore off the right wing, followed by the outboard flaps tearing off; the Tu-124 was put into a spin rotating 45°/s (7.5 rpm). At 00:26 the damaged airliner reached an altitude of while at a speed of and a rate of descent of , putting a 5g load on the aircraft, resulting in the left wing tearing off the airliner and the fuselage breaking apart in mid-air. The wreckage of the crash was found at 07:40 Moscow time in the town of Inokovka, on the floodplains of the Vorona River in Tambov Oblast in the Russian SFSR. The wreckage was spread across an area , with fragments of the fuselage in an area of . All 63 passengers and crew were killed in the accident, which remains the deadliest Tu-124 crash in aviation history.  Conclusions  The exact reason for the flaps being released at cruising altitude was not discovered because major portions of the flap control system were not found among the wreckage. The board did speculate several possible causes but produced no definitive cause for the release of the flaps in the first place. Possible causes were as described: # It was possible that the pilot in command accidentally threw the switch to release the flaps without realizing it. Tests of the lock on that switch showed that accidentally activating it was indeed possible. # Electrical malfunction of the signals in the flap control system; investigators speculated if it is possible that a signal from a nearby wire could have activated it, but not quickly, and such issue would not have been detected by mechanics. However, six Tu-124 aircraft with identical flap control systems were examined to test this hypothesis but all the tests showed the flap control system to be in safe working order. It is also unknown why the crew weakened their grip on the control column at 00:25:13, which led to the aircraft going into a sharp rate of descent. Possible reasons for this include: # The crew could have been misled by the indications of the variometer, which indicated the aircraft was increasing altitude at speeds between 15–20 m/s when it was actually decreasing at a rate of 40–45 m/s; # The crew could have diverted their attention towards other tasks in the cockpit, ex. changing engine power, attempting to adjust the flaps, checking the position of the spoilers, etc.; # Overload and overspeed on the control column; # The overload from the rate of descent limiting the crew's capability to apply sufficient force; # any combination of the above factors.  Aftermath  The Tupolev Tu-124 was withdrawn from regular passenger service in the USSR, but was still used by the Soviet military. The design and placement of the switch to release the flaps was changed to prevent accidental activation of the flaps.

Location Mungret Abbey is located immediately west of Dooradoyle and northeast of Mungret College, southwest of Limerick city centre, to the south of the Shannon Estuary. History black and white image old Mungret Church Ruin Mungret was an early monastic site, founded before AD 551 by Saint Nessan (Neasán) the Deacon. At one point there may have been as many as 1,500 monks and six churches operating in competition to attract followers. Some offered free loaves and salted fish to entice followers to their ceremonies on special occasions. The first Thursday of every month was devoted to developing good habits, and monks were encouraged to chant for their supper, after devout prayer. John O'Donovan claimed a fourth-century date, predating Saint Patrick. In 908, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King of Munster, gifted the abbey three ounces of gold and a satin chasuble. It was plundered on four occasions in the 9th century by Vikings. High King Domnall Ua Lochlainn destroyed the monastery in 1107. Mungret claimed episcopal status 1152, but was deemed to be too close to Limerick. 1179 the then king of Munster, Domnall Mór Ua Briain, granted the monastery to Brictius, Bishop of Limerick. Mungret then became a parish church (built 1251−72), operated by the Augustinian Canons Regular. Mungret Abbey church was used by the Church of Ireland until 1822. The antiquary Austin Cooper wrote about Mungret in 1781. The building was extended and the tower, the priest's living quarters, was added during the 15th century. A bell was found at Loghmore nearby, called the Bell of Mungret. Buildings Mungret Abbey Located in the west of the group. A nave and chancel church with a square tower at the west.

Background Since the Troubles began, the South Armagh area—especially around Crossmaglen and other similar republican strongholds—was one of the most dangerous places for the British security forces, and the IRA's South Armagh brigade carried out numerous ambushes on the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). This included the 1975 Drummuckavall ambush and the 1978 downing of a British Army Gazelle helicopter which led to the death of one British soldier and four others being seriously injured. \\\\- A number of British security force members had been killed in Crossmaglen during 1978. On 4 March, Nicholas Smith (20), 7 Platoon, B Company, 2 Royal Green Jackets, was killed by an IRA booby trap bomb while attempting to remove an Irish flag from a telegraph pole in Crossmaglen. On 17 June, William Turbitt (42) and Hugh McConnell (32), both Protestant RUC officers, were shot by the IRA while on mobile patrol near Crossmaglen. McConnell was killed at the scene, but Turbitt was kidnapped. The next day, a Catholic priest, Fr. Hugh Murphy, was kidnapped in retaliation but later released after appeals from Protestant clergy. The body of Turbitt was found on 10 July 1978. Ambush When the patrol was near Rio's Bar in Crossmaglen coming around a bend, a red Royal Mail-type van was spotted by the patrol's commander, Sergeant Richard Garmory. The van was fitted with armour plating and was facing away from the patrol, which Garmory believed to be in a suspicious place on the other side of the street. Just as Garmory noticed what looked like boxes in the back of the van (it was sand bag covering for the IRA) IRA volunteers opened fire from the back of the van with an M60 machine gun which was fitted to the van's floor. Four other IRA volunteers armed with AR-15 ArmaLite rifles and an AK47 opened fire on the patrol and the British soldiers returned fire but did not claim any hits. A handful of Christmas shoppers scrambled for cover. Three soldiers at the front of the patrol were fatally wounded. They were treated by staff at a nearby health centre and then taken to Musgrave Park Hospital but were declared dead on arrival.Toby Harnden, Bandit Country, Coronet Books, 2010; , pp. 62, 84-86 The soldiers killed were Graham Duggan (22), Kevin Johnson (20) and Glen Ling (18).

Ono earned the 2017 Paul Gast Lectureship award from the European Association of Geochemistry, given to mid-career scientists who have made outstanding contributions to geochemistry.  Research initiatives  Ono has developed an instrument that uses tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy to detect the ratio of different isotopes in a sample of methane, which can indicate the methane’s source. The instrument has enabled his group to discover the origins of methane from seafloor hot springs, and to understand the effects of microbial and atmospheric methane cycling on the isotopic composition of methane in a sample. Ono’s team also measures sulfur isotopes to study how early microbial life impacted atmospheric and ocean chemistry. Specifically, they are looking at Archean rocks in South Africa and Western Australia that are 4 to 2.5 billion years old. They also are using sulfur isotopes to investigate sulfur cycling within mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vent systems and sulfate reduction in the deep subsurface. Additionally, Ono collaborates with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor of Atmospheric Science Ronald Prinn to explore the natural and environmental sources of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas and catalyst that destroys ozone.

Sullivan, Captain U.S. Army Air Force, Circa 1943 William N. Sullivan (June 23, 1908 - March 2, 1979) was an American entomologist who is widely credited with co-inventing the aerosol bomb or \\"bug bomb,\\" with Lyle D. Goodhue, while employed by the United States Department of Agriculture. The \\"bug bomb\\" was developed for aircraft disinsection through the dispersion of insecticide for controlling mosquitoes. The invention proved invaluable in the Pacific Theater during World War II where it was used extensively to control the spread of insect borne disease - primarily malaria - which was causing far more casualties than actual combat. Personal Life and Education Sullivan was born on June 23, 1908 in Lawrence, Massachusetts, one of eight children born to Katherine (Lynch) and William N. Sullivan, Sr. between 1898 and 1910. Three of his siblings died at young ages; Katherine as a toddler of unknown causes, Frances as an infant of whooping cough, and Mary at age 20 of tuberculosis. William received his early education in the public schools of Lawrence, graduating from Lawrence High School in 1926. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930 from Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst and then a Master of Science degree (Entomology Major) in 1939, also from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. William was a member of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) as an undergraduate student at Massachusetts Agriculture College, and he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army 3rd Cavalry Division, Reserves at graduation. William N. Sullivan never married and had no children. Career The majority of Sullivan's career was with the United States Department of Agriculture (May 18, 1931 - May 5, 1942, and July 21, 1947 - June 30, 1978). He served in the United States Army Air Force during and after World War II (May 5, 1942 - July 21, 1947), entering as a commissioned 1st Lieutenant and rising to t Major before being honorably discharged. World War II Aerosol Bomb (Bug Bomb) In the late 1930s, the first of Sullivan's scientific innovations occurred as a result of his interest in the emergence of global air transportation and the possible damage that aircraft travel could do by spreading insects dangerous to humans, crops, and animals. At that time, a crude hand sprayer was used to disperse a solution of pyrethrum in kerosene with the hope of killing some of the insect hitchhikers. Sullivan joined with Dr. Lyle D. Goodhue, an accomplished chemist, to develop improved methods for disinsecting aircraft. Theirs first effort involved burning a mixture of pyrethrum, corn stalks, and sodium nitrate in the presence of house flies. The kill was satisfactory, but too much of the insecticide was destroyed by burning. Dripping the solution on the heated surface of a hotplate gave better results, and splashing was overcome by spraying the solution on a hotplate. The heat produced a fine mist or aerosol that was 20 times more effective against house flies than the original burning method. This principle was widely used in \\"fogging machines\\" to control mosquitoes in urban areas, but it was not a practical way for disinsecting aircraft. Goodhue and Sullivan subsequently experimented with a mixture of pyrethrum, sesame oil, and Freon 12 (Dichlorodifluoromethane) placed in a 5 lb. carbon dioxide cylinder equipped with a valve and an oil burner nozzle. When the tank was inverted and the valve opened, the solution was sprayed out under the vapor pressure of Freon 12, which is 82 lbs./sq. in. at 20 deg. C. The Freon immediately evaporated and left the insecticide dispersed in the air as an aerosol. Goodhue and Sullivan now had a method of dispersing insecticides that was simple, highly effective against mosquitoes, nonflammable, and nonstaining; exactly the qualities that they were seeking in aircraft disinsection. The U.S. Patent Office subsequently granted Goodhue and Sullivan a patent (#2,321,023) on this invention which was assigned to the Secretary of Agriculture. The breadboard model, as the original patented aerosol was referred to, was excellent for demonstrations, but unsuitable for use in the field. In the jungles of the South Pacific, malaria alone incapacitated eight times as many troops as combat. Sullivan was commissioned into the U.S. Army Air Force and assigned to the Army Medical Center, Walter Reed Hospital. The commanding officer there was familiar with the aerosol development, and secured his transfer to the Aero-Medical Laboratory, Wright Patterson Army Air Force Base to develop a suitable insecticidal aerosol container for use by troops in the field. At Wright Field, a representative of Westinghouse Electric Co. and Lt. Sullivan evolved the idea of modifying the 1-lb Freon container used for home refrigerators for use as the aerosol dispenser. The prototype was promising, but the rubber stopper that was used to seal the container between uses was found to leak. This difficulty was overcome by using a metal screw cap, and the World War II \\"aerosol bomb\\" was born. Within three months of Sullivan's arrival at Wright Field, the first order of 150,000 aerosol bombs went out. With this order began the manufacture of over 40 million aerosol bombs during World War II for military use. Sullivan was attached to the Air Transport Command, after three months at Wright Field, and assigned to train personnel in the use of the newly-developed aerosol insecticide at U.S. air bases serving the North Africa and India theatres,. During the tour of duty, he traveled throughout British West Africa, North Africa and Karachi, India (now part of Pakistan), in charge of dis- insecticizing U.S. planes to prevent their carrying the malaria-bearing anopheles gambia mosquito and other insects to South American air bases. After 18 months of service overseas,he was transferred to the Army Air Force Center at Orlando, FL, to develop methods of controlling mosquitoes in jungle areas by airplane spraying. In July 1946 he served as a radiological monitor on atomic bomb tests at the Southwest Pacific atoll of Bikini. Released to inactive duty as a Major in the U.S. Army Air Force in August 1947, he returned to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine where he spent the remainder of his career, continuing to specialize in aircraft disinsection.

It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea where it is associated with reefs. It is found in the aquarium trade. Description Anthias anthias has a rather deep body which has a standard length which is equivalent to 2.5 times its depth. The dorsal fin has 10 spines, with the third spine being especially long, and 15 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 7 soft rays. The pectoral fins are longer than the pelvic fins. The caudal fin has asymmetrical, pointed lobes with lower lobe being longer than the upper lobe. It has a complete lateral line which has 36-39 scales, the scales are large. Their colour varies from pink through to red and they have 3 yellow lines on the sides of their heads. Frequently they can show brown blotches along the back. The pelvic fins are yellow in colour but when breeding those of the males turn red. They can attain a standard length of but they are more normally around . Distribution Anthias anthias is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. In the Eastern Atlantic it occurs from Portugal south to Angola and northern Namibia. It also occurs around the Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands and Cape Verde Islands and the islands in the Gulf of Guinea. It is widespread in the Mediterranean and has been recorded in the Canakkale Strait off Gallipoli but not in the Black Sea. Habitat and biology Anthias anthias occurs from in depth and lives among rocks and corals, hiding in caves during the day. It emerges at night to feed on zooplankton, small crustacea and smaller fishes. >ref name = Atlantis/> This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, all individuals hatch as females. Each time a male dies, one of the larger females changes her sex and becomes male. The majority are female throughout their lives and even a large school of these fish will contain only a few males. It takes around two weeks for the female to change sex and this involves not just a change in the gonads but also in colour, size and shape. If there are too many males in a social group then some of the males can reverse the sex change and revert to being females. They have been observed to co-operatively feed, some fish feed while others herd the prey, such as shrimp, the roles being reversed to allow all the fish to feed. Species description and taxonomy Anthias anthias was first formally described in 1758 as Labrus anthius by Carolus Linnaeus in Volume 1 of the Xth edition of the Systema Naturae with the type locality given as southern Europe. When Marcus Elieser Bloch created the genus Anthias he used Anthias sacer as the type species but this is regarded as a synonym of Linnaeus's Labrus anthias, so this species is the type species of its genus. The name anthias is Greek for a fish, probably the gilt-head bream. Utilisation Anthias anthias is used in the marine aquarium trade.

The case drew particular national media attention because it happened in a middle-class residential part of the city not customarily known for such a crime. Adding all the more to its controversy was that it was carried out by a band of mixed-race youth from neighboring Montgomery County's upscale suburban Abington Township that no one ever suspected of being capable of committing such a crime. Because of these two factors combined plus others, the Philadelphia 911 emergency phone service and the Philadelphia police were extraordinarily slow in responding that night and proved far from adequate, with that aspect of the case in itself drawing considerable media attention. Inciting incident The murder of Eddie Polec was the end result of minor hostilities that had developed between some Fox Chase youth and a young female from Abington Township the week before outside a Fox Chase McDonald's Restaurant. A group of Fox Chase teenagers there were alleged to have upset the girl by tossing a plastic cup of soda into her car. This much was later admitted to by the Fox Chase youth. But when word of the incident got back to Abington Township it grew wildly out of proportion to include a false rumor that she had been raped in the McDonald's parking lot. In response, a group of Abington teenagers decided to retaliate on her behalf in conjunction with a warning she had allegedly made the night of the initial incident just before departing Fox Chase: \\"You're all getting [expletive] beat up next weekend.\\" According to witnesses, she was seen again in Fox Chase early the following Friday night driving the same vehicle, this time along with Abington youth in another car, the passengers of both cars making threats similar to the one she had made the week before, only this time for later that night. Both vehicles then departed Fox Chase, and around 9:30 P.M. five carloads packed with other Abington teenagers arrived in their wake in what was described as a tightly formed caravan. With music blasting loudly, it first stopped at a Fox Chase 7-Eleven store, and after fully taking over its parking lot, some of its passengers got out and demanded directions to the McDonald's. The one perceived to be the leader was overheard to say, \\"Come on, we have to do this. We have a job to get done. Let's do this before the police come.\\" Before returning to their cars he was witnessed jumping up and down shouting: \\"I'm so psyched, I could kill someone.\\" Initial assaults Just before 10:00 P.M. the caravan next arrived to the McDonald's, where its passengers then jumped out and began chasing every Fox Chase youth they saw with broken off hockey sticks and baseball bats. According to one account, they outnumbered the Fox Chase teenagers thirteen to two. They cornered one and began severely beating him with bats until his friends could pull him free. The Fox Chase teenagers then scattered, but the rampage spread out to encompass a much wider portion of Fox Chase. Startled adult Fox Chase residents and others when witnessing this unfolding melee overtaking their normally peaceful neighborhood began calling Philadelphia's 911 emergency response service in growing number, each caller expecting police to be sent out right away. Some callers described what looked to be as many as 40 to 50 kids shouting obscenities, smashing bottles, hurling rocks, and breaking car windows. But with no police patrol cars being dispatched, the caravan began racing recklessly throughout Fox Chase until finally zeroing in on one particular young male it saw near to the front steps of his church – Eddie Polec, who had simply been waiting there to walk home with his younger brother when suddenly he found himself being chased down by this loud succession of cars coming straight at him. As the caravan sharply pulled into the church's parking lot cutting him off while simultaneously blocking other Fox Chase youth from coming to his aid, he tried running farther, but the first passenger out threw a baseball bat at his legs causing him to fall. The moment he was down that Abington teenager and others began striking him with baseball bats as he helplessly lay on the ground pleading for his life. He was then brought back to his feet once more so that some in the group could take bat swings directly at his head. After suffering eight forceful blows to the head this way he was then dropped back to the pavement, at which point another, wearing steal tipped boots, kicked him several times in the face. With that final assault, the assailants then quickly fled in their caravan and were said to have been laughing and high-fiving one another as it sped away. Authorities would later describe it as having been one of the most brutal murders in all Philadelphia history. Arrival of police It was 40 minutes after the first 911 call was placed that police were finally sent. But by then it was too late. The young Eddie Polec lay bloodied and unconscious on the steps of a church where just a few short years before he had served as an altar boy. He was immediately rushed to a hospital. But the following morning, after a full night of intensive medical emergency treatment had failed, Eddie Polec was pronounced dead. As the news of his death broke, it would later come out that while Eddie Polec's friends gathered in mourning outside the church where he had been killed the night before, four teenage girls from Abington who had been part of the caravan the night before attended a party for a friend just a few blocks away from the church, by all accounts totally unfazed by it. News coverage The news coverage of Eddie Polec's murder quickly went national, with the failure on the part of Philadelphia's 911 operators receiving special emphasis, much of the blame being placed directly on them. Fox Chase residents and others had complained about them being insensitive and unresponsive, and even expressing resentment as the callers tried to make clear the matter's urgency. The head of the union representing the operators stated that the reason for their questionable performance was because they had been working with outdated equipment, were underpaid, and had not been trained properly by the city. Nonetheless, Philadelphia's Mayor Ed Rendell took immediate disciplinary action against them, saying, \\"Flaws in the system in no way, shape or form give anybody license to be abusive to citizens calling to report a crime.\\" In their own defense the operators soon after appeared on ABC's The Oprah Winfrey Show, where they tried to argue that they had done a good job that night. But 911 tapes that had been released by the police and that were getting extensive airplay nationally by that point only confirmed the callers' accusations. The 911 operators themselves, meantime, believed that because they were all African American they were being made political scapegoats. But that claim was denounced by the president of Philadelphia's branch of the NAACP, Thornhill Cosby, who said: \\"This is not a racial issue. It is a human issue.\\" The 911 workers appealed the city's disciplinary action and were eventually exonerated. The mayor, meantime, created a commission to explore ways the 911 system could be improved upon The investigation of Eddie Polec's murder led to the arrest of seven Abington teenagers, aged 16 to 18, with six of them charged with murder, and the seventh for supplying the bats used in the crime. All of them were found to have some school disciplinary records., in some instances for violent behavior, and one had been expelled for bringing a gun into school. Several of them were on probation for various offenses. Four of them were students at Abington High School, another had graduated from there, and two attended other schools. The investigation also revealed that many other youths from Abington had been involved as well. But those others were never charged. The reason why, it was argued, they had to be ruled out to keep the case manageable, given the extraordinary extent of it. As one Philadelphia police officer put it, when youth from Abington were brought into Philadelphia's police headquarters for purposes of establishing witnesses they all acted like suspects. All the females were described as being defiantly untruthful while all the males showed no signs of sympathy towards the victim When the news emerged that teenagers from Abington were behind it, Abington declared the week \\"Nonviolent Conflict Resolution Week,\\" while fellow students at Abington High School were reported to be in shock, having a great deal of difficulty comprehending how this crime could have originated from what they had perceived to be an idyllic suburbia totally free of such type behavior. The mother of one of the perpetrators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, \\"These are suburban kids – you don't figure them to go bad. It's not their character to be a rough group of kids.\\" Nonetheless, the news media attacks on Abington's newly acquired bad image continued, with the Daily News in its front-page headline calling Abington High School \\"MURDER HIGH\\" alongside a graphic of the school's crest, with a subhead reading: \\"They're suspects in Fox Chase beating – and they're walking the halls in Abington.\\" This particular report drew strong criticism from Eddie Polec's younger brother, who in a local TV news spot insisted it totally mischaracterized Abington kids as he knew them to be. For despite the crime and a strong desire among many to seek revenge, all the members of the Polec family showed extraordinary restraint. This especially came to light when they appeared on local television pleading for calm and to allow the courts to handle the matter. This plea on their part proved effective. Following it not a single retaliation attempt was reported, although news media attacks on Philadelphia's 911 system continued unabashed. These criticisms grew so intense that they threatened to fully derail the mayoral administration of Ed Rendell, who up till then had been praised as a fast rising star on the U.S. political stage and had been hailed as \\"America's Mayor\\" by The Wall Street Journal. In his defense he appeared on Larry King Live and other national broadcasts in efforts to distance himself from what he summarized as a defective carryover from previous administrations that he vowed to amend. Still, the bad publicity regarding Philadelphia's 911 system remained strong, with NBC-TV's Saturday Night Live doing a comedy sketch with Roseanne Arnold in the role of an indifferent Philadelphia 911 operator refusing to take any callers seriously. As for Eddie Polec, he had been a well-liked high school senior with no apparent ties to the Fox Chase youth said to have initially sparked the hostilities. His popularity was such that when a memorial service for him was held at his church, his entire high school senior class was in attendance, the church itself was packed to near double capacity, and a thousand more people stood outside in the rain where a loudspeaker was set up so all could hear the service. At his viewing over four thousand people came, waiting in line for hours to pay last respects, and his funeral procession when traveling from the funeral home to the cemetery was reported to be a mile long. Murder trial The Eddie Polec murder trial began on January 2, 1996. at the Philadelphia Criminal Justice Center with Judge Jane Cutler Greenspan of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas presiding. Joseph Patrick Casey of the Philadelphia district attorney's office served as the prosecuting attorney, and Angelo Charles Peruto, Sr., in addition to his personally representing one of the defendants, served as the lead defense attorney. Other defendants under his representation also had their own personal defense attorneys. Famous for never having lost a murder case, and notorious for representing major Philadelphia organized crime figures, the Eddie Polec murder trial would prove to be one of Peruto's greatest challenges Another defendant, the grandson of a retired Philadelphia police officer, was not under Peruto's representation because he had struck a deal with the prosecution to be the star witness in exchange for leniency. Before the trial got under way, although the defendants would be tried as adults, the Philadelphia's district attorney ruled out the death penalty because under Pennsylvania law there weren't enough aggravating circumstances to make it a capital offense. So the prosecution sought convictions for first-degree-murder life sentences instead. This concurred with the Polec family, who strongly opposed the death penalty on moral grounds Throughout the trial all members of the Polec family were in attendance along with many others from the Fox Chase community. All the defendants, meantime, were allowed to freely walk around outside the courtroom and immediately outside the Criminal Justice Center whenever the trial was not in session. Ofttimes the Polec family and others from Fox Chase saw them in passing. And although this became questionable when one of the defendants turned violent out in the courtroom hallway and had to be quickly restrained by a police detective, the practice was allowed to continue. After several weeks of exposure to powerful arguments made by the prosecution, with graphic medical photos being shown of the extent of the brutality to Eddie Polec, countless witness testimonies, arguments made by the defense team – which primarily questioned the validity of the star witness – and six days of deliberation, on February 5, 1996 at 5:00 P.M. the jury announced the verdict. It found three of the defendants guilty of third-degree murder and conspiracy, another of voluntary manslaughter and conspiracy, and two of conspiracy. The immediate reaction to the verdict was mixed, with the prosecuting attorney Joseph Casey overheard to whisper, \\"Eddie Polec is dead, and so is justice in the city of Philadelphia.\\" As the Polec family exited the Criminal Justice Center following the announcement, the father of Eddie Polec told reporters that they accepted the verdict, although they didn't understand it Sentencing took place on March 19, 1996. Just before it got underway the defendants were asked if they wanted to make any last statements. Only one agreed to, and in doing so was the only one to express any remorse. In response he became the only one shown any mercy by the court. His maximum sentence of fifteen to thirty years for third-degree murder and conspiracy was reduced by six months. Of the other three defendants found guilty of the same charge, one received ten to twenty years for murder and a consecutive five to ten years for conspiracy, and the third was sentenced to fifteen to thirty years. The one found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and conspiracy received eight to twenty years, and the two found guilty of conspiracy were sentenced to five to ten years. Legacy In the trial's aftermath, the father of Eddie Polec, through a determined letter-writing campaign and intense lobbying effort, tried to sway Pennsylvania's legislators to change how the law defined first-degree murder. And because some members of the defense team had made false and misleading statements during the trial, he hoped for a possible re- ruling. But all these efforts failed, and the Philadelphia District Attorney's office officially closed the case in September 1996. During this same period he turned down the chance to sue the city for $50 million, choosing instead to dedicate himself to ensuring that Philadelphia's Mayor Ed Rendell made good on his promise to upgrade the city's 911 system. And that effort paid off. In exchange for his agreeing not to sue, in September 1998 Philadelphia officially dedicated its all-new 911 Emergency Communication Center, along with far better training for operators. In addition, the father of Eddie Polec became a much-in-demand speaker at church groups and high schools, and he did extensive voluntary work for the non-profit Lost Dreams on Canvas organization that commissions artists to do portraits of children who were killed violently to be displayed at area schools, shopping malls, etc. The Eddie Polec murder case also spurred the formation of the Fox Chase Town Watch Association., with one of the first callers to Philadelphia's 911 system the night of the crime eventually becoming its leader And in 1999 the Los Angeles-based journalist team of Bryn Freedman (Emmy winning investigative reporter, radio talk show host for ABC News and USA Broadcasting., and the official reporter who covered the Polec murder trial) and William Knoedelseder (former Los Angeles Times reporter and news executive at Fox TV, Disney and USA Broadcasting) published a book titled, In Eddie's Name: One Family's Triumph over Tragedy, which intimately explored every aspect of what the Polec family went through, with in-depth insights about the murder, investigation, and trial Since 1994 there has not been another incident in Fox Chase in any way similar to the Eddie Polec murder case. But several decades later many questions still remain how it could have happened and also with regards to how it was handled by the courts  References  Category:1994 murders in the United States Category:Crimes in Philadelphia Category:1994 in Pennsylvania Category:1996 in Pennsylvania Category:History of Philadelphia Category:Incidents of violence against boys ","title":"Eddie Polec murder case"},{"id":"56164208","text":"Apache Arrow is a language-agnostic software framework for developing data analytics applications that process columnar data.

The two countries established relations following the independence of Moldova at 1991. History Historically, the Principality of Moldavia was a vassal of Kingdom of Poland and later, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to this, a small but active Polish community existed in Moldova. Both were later occupied by Russia and Soviet Union in various times. Polish Community in Moldova Petru Lucinschi served as the second President of Moldova and carries a transcribed version of the Polish surname Łuczyński. According to the 1989 Soviet Census, there were 4,739 Poles in the Moldavian SSR.\\"Moldova: Arena of International Influences\\", 2012, , \\"Support of Polish Disapora\\" The Moldovan Census of 2004 reported 2,383 Poles. 2004 Moldovan Census results (list of all available census documents in .xls and .doc format) The latter census did not include data collected in Transnistria, which for centuries was within the boundaries of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and was subject to significant Polish colonization. The 2004 Census in Transnistria reported 2% of the population (about 1,100) to be Poles. Some publications of Polonia activists and Polish diplomats mention numbers of more than 20,000 Poles in Moldova, -- numbers significantly exceeding that of self-identified Poles in the census. Some authors include in their estimates people of Polish descent, while others assume people of Catholic faith (in a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country) are most probably of Polish descent; and this may include, e.g. Ukrainians with ties to Poland in their ancestry. As a consequence of the Russian and Soviet policies towards Polish culture, only a small percentage of Poles in Moldova today speak Polish. For example, Petru Lucinschi (, who served as the second President of Moldova carries a transcribed version of the Polish surname Łuczyński, but has never publicly identified with a Polish heritage. A number of Transnistrian politicians such as former First Lady Nina Shtanski and Yevgeni Zubov, however, are open about their Polish roots. Modern relations Poland has always been a vocal supporter for Moldova's integration and membership to the European Union, which Poland is a member of. Poland has been well-aware with political marginalization of Moldova with the situation of Transnistria and Poland has officially announced it won't recognize Transnistria as a separate nation.

Related to the handover of the mandate by Tubagus Fathul Adzim to Soerjaatmadja, historical records mention that in the early days of Indonesian Independence around 1947 there was a meeting between the heirs of the Sultanate of Banten (Ratu Bagus Aryo Marjono Soerjaatmadja), President of Indonesia (Sukarno), Sultan of Yogyakarta (Hamengkubuwono IX), and Resident of Banten (Tubagus Ahmad Chatib al-Bantani). At the meeting, Sukarno invited the heir to the throne of Banten Sultanate to lead the Banten area back, but the heir to the throne due to his responsibilities as Director of BRI (now the Governor of Bank Indonesia) entrusted Banten's leadership including the guarding and maintenance of the big family asset of Banten Sultanate to Tubagus Ahmad Chatib al-Bantani as Resident of Banten, until the time when child or grandson Marjono return to Banten. 2013 In 2013, Soerjaatmadja genealogy as the heir of the Sultanate of Banten recognized and endorsed by Rabithah Azmatkhan as research institute Walisongo descendants family.

He was also given a testament and mandate as the heir of the Sultanate who led culturally to strengthen the bond with the community, local government, and the Bantenese ulama. 2016 Soerajaatmadja was officially crowned as the 18th Sultan of Banten with the title of Sultan Syarif Muhammad as-Shafiuddin during the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's Mawlid at the Great Mosque of Banten, Serang, Banten, on Sunday 11 December 2016. As the Sultan of Banten =Pros and cons= A series of pros and cons occurred after the establishment of Soerjaatmadja as the 18th Sultan of Banten on December 11, 2016 in Old Banten. The Religious Courts of Serang spoke about the pros and cons of the inauguration. The court declared not to establish the title of 18th Sultan of Banten, but only set Soerjaatmadja as the heir of the descendants of the Sultanate of Banten. The Decree of the Religious Courts of Serang was numbered 0316 / PDT.P / 2016 / PA.SRG dated 22 September 2016 on the Stipulation of the Heirs. Meanwhile, Soerjaatmadja said that the decision of the Religious Courts of Serang has established himself as the heir of the Sultanate of Banten so entitled to the title of Sultan of Banten. He invited the parties who objected to his enthronement as the 18th Sultan of Banten to file a lawsuit. As the Sultan of Banten, he intends to embrace all parties, including those who reject the coronation himself as the Sultan of Banten. Soerjaatmadja wants to invite all to work together to rebuild the glory of the Sultanate of Banten. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ulema Council of Banten Province assessed the horizontal conflict that occurred on the coronation of the 18th Sultan of Banten between Soerjaatmadja as the heir of the Sultanate with the Kenadziran Kesultanan Banten was a family affair and must be resolved by way of kinship.

Schooner barges originated on the Great Lakes in the 1860s and were in use until World War II, although a few survived into the 1950s. Even though steamboats were used for time-critical routes such as for passengers and mail, schooners were still economical to use for bulk cargoes such as grain, wood, or iron ore. Steam tugs were introduced on the Great Lakes that could tow one or more barges. Since old schooners were available, they could be adapted to towing service with reduced crews. When winds were favorable, the schooner barge could have one or two sails rigged to save fuel in the steam tug. Eventually schooner-rigged wooden ships were purposely built for use as barges. The concept was later extended to salt- water use, with, for example, the United States Navy converting some schooners for use as barges for coal.Theodore J. Karamanski Schooner Passage: Sailing Ships and the Lake Michigan Frontier , Wayne State University Press, 2000, pp. 35-41 Because of rough weather and small crews, schooner barges were frequently lost from tows, set adrift during bad weather, or sunk. By the 1920s, schooner barges were no longer in practical use on the Great Lakes since steam and diesel powered ships provided better operating flexibility and safety, with lower crew costs than a tug and barges hauling the same amount of cargo.

Originally trained in Ireland, he was a top-class performer as a juvenile in 1998 when he finished second in both the Tyros Stakes and the Futurity Stakes before recording his biggest win in the Group 1 National Stakes. After failing to win as a three-year-old he was sent to the United States and gelded. Returning to the track in 2001 he made little impact in two starts but did much better in the following year when he won five races including the Henry S. Clark Stakes and C. Edmund O'Brien Stakes. Background Mus-If was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by Eurostrait Ltd. As a yearling he was consigned to the sales at Deauville in August 1997 and was bought for ₣350,000 by Hamdan Al-Maktoum's Shadwell Estate company. The colt was sent to Ireland and entered training with Dermot Weld. He was one of the best horses sired by Lahib who won the Queen Anne Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. Lahib's other progeny included Super Tassa, Vicious Circle (Ebor Handicap), Last Resort (Challenge Stakes) and Late Night Out (Supreme Stakes). Mus-If's dam Navajo Love Song showed little racing ability, failing to win in seven starts. She was, however, a descendant of the French broodmare Moira (foaled 1959) who was the female-line ancestor of Dancing Maid. Racing career 1998: two-year-old season Mus-If made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 18 June in which he started at odds of 7/2 and finished second by a neck to Fable after leading for most of the way. Eighteen days late he recorded his first success in a maiden over seven furlongs at the Curragh. Ridden by Mick Kinane and starting the 6/4 favourite, he took the lead three furlongs out and kept on well in the closing stages to win by a head from Globe Theatre. The colt was moved up in class for the Listed Tyros Stakes over the same course and distance on 15 August for which he started favourite but was beaten into second place by the Jim Bolger-trained filly Arctic Blue. He found another Bolger filly, St Clair Ridge, too good for him in the Group 3 Futurity Stakes two weeks later and was beaten a length and a half into second place. In the Group 1 National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 20 September Mus-If, with Kinane in the saddle started the 8/1 third choice in the betting behind the Acomb Stakes runner-up Coliseum and Globe Theatre. None of the other six runners had contested a Group race, making the field appear to be a poor one by Group 1 standards. The best horse in the race was probably the British-trained Royal Rebel, who later won two editions of the Ascot Gold Cup. Wearing blinkers, Mus-If went to the front from the start, opened up a clear advantage approaching the last quarter mile and held off the late challenge of Coliseum to win by a neck. 1999: three-year-old season Mus-if began his second season in the Listed 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown on 18 April. He took the lead in the straight but was caught in the final strides and was beaten a head by the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Saffron Walden. In the Irish 2000 Guineas five week later at the Curragh he went to the front two furlongs out but was overtaken entering the final furlong and came home fourth behind Saffron Walden, Enrique and Orpen with the 2000 Guineas winner Island Sands in fifth. The colt was the dropped in class for the International Stakes over nine furlongs at the Curragh in June but finished last of the five runners behind the Henry Cecil-tranied favourite Great Dane. On his final European start, Mus-If was sent to Germany to contest the Group 2 Grosse Europcar-Meile at Cologne-Weidenpesch Racecourse on 25 September. He was made the 3/5 favourite but came home fourth behind the four- year-old El Divino. 2001: five-year-old season At the end of his European racing career Mus-If was sent to the United States where he was \\"mistakenly\\" gelded. He re-entered training in 2001 and joined the stable of Neil Drysdale in California. He raced twice at Santa Anita Park, finishing second in a claiming race in February and fourth in a similar event in March. 2002: six-year-old season In 2002 Mus-If moved to the training stable of Michael Pino and began his campaign in claiming races at Fair Grounds Race Course. After finishing fourth and third on his first two starts he recorded his first success for three and a half years whe taking a claimer on 11 March. After winning a similar event at Keeneland Racecourse in April he was stepped up in class to contest the Henry S. Clark Stakes over one mile at Pimlico Race Course on 4 May. Starting favourite against ten opponents he took the lead in the stretch and won by five lengths under a \\"hand ride\\" from his trainer's brother Mario Pino. Three weeks later at the same track, Mus-If extended his winning sequence to four in the C. Edmund O'Brien Stakes. With Mario Pino again in the saddle he started at long odds-on and came home two lengths clear of Cynics Beware after taking the lead on the home turn. His victory was only confirmed after a lengthy inquiry by the racecourse stewards into possible interference caused by Mus-If to one of his rivals on the far turn. The gelding's winning streak came to an end in June when he was beaten into second place by Del Mar Show in the Grade III New Hampshire Sweepstakes Handicap at Rockingham Park. In the late summer and autumn of 2002 Mus-If was campaigned at Delaware Park Racetrack where he finished sixth in the Susex Handicap and third in the Leader of the Band Stakes before winning a claiming race on 6 October. On his last two starts he finished second in a claiming race at Churchill Downs in November and seventh in a similar event at Fair Grounds on 8 December.

It models an alternate way of organizing the military, along lines of responsibility and competence instead of heredity and privilege, as he had seen that the British Armed Forces was at that time. Plot The story begins with an army officer taking the narrator to show off his military unit, the Tynesiders. It is revealed that in this parallel Britain envisaged by Kipling, military service for males is voluntary, but almost universal, because only those who have served may vote, along with a number of other incentives. The result is a sort of citizen militia composed of competent men focused on dealing with any threat to their community and nation. In addition to ensuring home defence this \\"Army of a Dream\\" contains units intended for overseas colonial service and for possible intervention in Europe. The complex and idealised military system of Kipling's imagination includes features such as rudimentary training for boys beginning at the age of eight, close integration between army and navy and an Empire- wide sense of assimilation between civilians and soldiers. On the last page of the novel the unnamed story teller suddenly realises that the officers accompanying him on his inspection tour are actually dead friends or acquaintances who died in the mismanaged South African War. Criticism \\"The Army of a Dream\\" was criticised as being political propaganda masquerading as a short story. Kipling himself acknowledged that it was not a serious attempt at army reform but simply an effort to put forward a number of ideas for consideration. Influence Rudyard Kipling was, in general, a major influence on one of the 20th century's most influential writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In his seminal work Starship Troopers, Heinlein models a similar society, where one is not a citizen unless one becomes a veteran of government service. While this does not have to be in combat forces but is actually more like being a civil servant, that novel follows characters in the mobile infantry, and is the origin of the mech trope that has pervaded science fiction since. Also foreshadowed is Heinlein's fondness for the competent hero, a character who — though usually bearing normal human flaws — is rugged and self-responsible, able to do most things at least on a fundamental level and functioning with a high level of confidence and self-actualization.

He was a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways and during World War I promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast. He persuaded the legislature to approve the project. In 1919, the legislature approved submission of a bond measure to voters. He was the son of Rufus Rigdon and Indiana Scott Rigdon. His parents homesteaded in Cambria during the 1860s. Elmer Rigdon became a rancher and timber harvester. He also owned a brickyard in Cambria and the Bank Mine on San Simeon Creek. He extracted quicksilver from the mine from 1903 to 1906, when he sold his interest. He was elected to the California State Assembly in 1914 and to the State Senate in 1916. Dr. John L. D. Roberts, who founded Seaside, California, had a strong interest in building a road along the California central coast. In 1897, he walked the entire stretch of rocky coast from Monterey to San Luis Obispo in five days and mapped out the course of the future road. He photographed the land and became the first surveyor of the route. In 1915, he presented the results of his survey and photographic work to a joint session of the California legislature. Roberts initially promoted the coastal highway to allow access to a region of spectacular beauty, but failed to obtain funding. Rigdon embraced the necessity of building the road. As a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways during World War I, he promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast and persuaded the legislature to support the project. The $1.5 million bond issue was approved by voters, but construction was delayed by World War I. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds. Rigdon died in office in San Francisco on December 13, 1922, before the highway was completed.

London: University of London Press Ltd, 1964Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 130 Sea fish New Quay harbour The sea around Ceredigion has traditionally been rich in fish and for many centuries great shoals of herring would be caught in Cardigan Bay. The fish would be landed and sold at all the Ceredigion ports, including Aberaeron, Aberporth and Aberystwyth. Flavours of Wales: Recipes, page 13. London: The Francis Frith Collection, 2011. Bobby Freeman: Traditional Food From Wales, page 71. New York: Hippocrene Books Inc., 1997. At Aberystwyth the volume of herring landed increased significantly after the harbour was enlarged during the eighteenth century. Here, the fish were salted between September and November and then packed in barrels for transport by train to England. Francis Frith, Flavours of Wales, page 12 Herring was also an important food source for local people and the fish were salted in the autumn for winter use. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 72 In South Wales herring are known as Ysgadenyn (or Sgadan for short); in North Wales they are known as Pennog. At Aberporth herrings were sold to the following: > Sgadan Aberporth, Dau fola ac un corff, Sgadan Aberporth, Dau enaid mewn un > corff Aberporth herrings, two bellies in one body. Aberporth herrings, two > souls in one body Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 71 Swper Scadan, or Supper Herrings, is a traditional baked dish from the area and contains six to eight herrings which have been cleaned, scaled and filleted. A seasoning of mustard, salt and ground black pepper is spread on the inside of each herring fillet and the fillets are then rolled and laid on top of layers of thin potato slices, onions and apples, which form a base. The whole dish is topped off with more sliced potatoes, additional seasoning and a dessert spoon of sage. Boiling water is added and then the dish is baked in foil which is removed, when nearly ready, in order to brown the potatoes. Francis Frith, Flavours of Wales, page 12 Historically, this dish is considered to be an interesting recipe because it reflects the simplicity of the traditional Welsh kitchen prior to the introduction of the frying pan. At this time boiling, roasting and stewing were the most common methods of food preparation and kitchen utensils included the griddle, the tripod (which was used for roasting), the bakestone and a great iron pot which would be suspended over a fire. Grant, Chris: Welsh Country Cooking, A Selection of Traditional and Well-loved Recipes, page 23. Llanrwst: Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 1993. Salted herrings would also be roasted on the tripod, as an alternative to baking. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 72 Coat of arms of Ceredigion showing a herring in the top right hand corner of the shield The traditional importance of fishing, and in particular the herring trade, is reflected in the coat of arms of the county, which were officially granted on October 21, 1937 and which have emblazoned in the top right quarter a herring against a background of the sea, to signify the fishing industry of Ceredigion Mackerel (Macrell) are also plentiful in Cardigan Bay. They are in season from late June to early September and are considered to have an excellent flavour when fresh. Bobby Freeman (writer and cook) commented that this fish is at its best when \\"the sea-green colours are very brilliant and beautiful, and the eyes are bright\\". In Ceredigion, Mackerel was usually fried in vegetable oil or olive oil. The olive oil used to be imported into the Ceredigion ports that used to trade with the Mediterranean. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, pages 67-68 It is reported that in the 1880s the fishermen of Aberaeron and New Quay once caught over one million mackerel over two nights. The fish were sold for a farthing each and what remained unsold from the mammoth catch was used on the fields as fertilizer. Francis Frith, Flavours of Wales, page 13 Monkfish is commonly caught in Cardigan Bay and Colin Pressdee comments that this fish is particularly suitable for kebabs due to the solid texture of the flesh, which is not grainy or flaky. He comments that the large tail can also be roasted French-style, like a leg of lamb and explains that this gives it the French name of 'gigot de mer'. He notes that in Ceredigion, some restaurants cook the fish in this way and accompany it with a red wine sauce.Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 92 Teifi Fish Bake is a traditional local fish dish made from fillets of cod and smoked haddock which are skinned, cubed and covered in a parsley sauce. Diced potato and Teifi cheese are added before the dish is baked and garnished with fresh parsley. [Welsh Calendar Cookbook, P 12] Shellfish gathered from the shore once formed an important source of food for Ceredigion families. One traditional dish included scrambled eggs to which limpets (llygaid meheryn) and common periwinkles (gwichiaid) were added, these were then fried in bacon fat. Limpets would also be boiled with nettle tips, to help tenderise them, before being fried in oatmeal. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 88 S. Minwel Tibbott, in her book 'Welsh Fare', has a recipe for Limpet Pie (tarten lygaid), which is a traditional dish from Aberporth. The limpets are boiled for half an hour and then bacon and leeks are added to a pastry-lined dish before being baked. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 89 Sand eels (llymriaid) were also eaten as part of the local diet and were usually fried in bacon fat. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 88 Lobster and shellfish are an important sea food industry for Ceredigion. However, by the 1980s the lobster stock of Cardigan Bay had become seriously depleted and this led to the Development Board for Rural Wales commencing a restocking programme. As a result, 19,000 baby lobsters were tagged and released off Aberystwyth between 1984 and 1988. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 135 Although fishing has been a traditional activity in Ceredigion for generations, fish stocks became heavily depleted due to commercial fishing. Today the trade is mainly restricted to local, part-time fishing boats. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 130 Gilli Davies comments that this means fishmongers and restaurants in places like Aberaeron usually serve fresh fish which may have been caught the same day, compared to deep sea fishing where the catch may spend up to two weeks at sea, before being transferred to market and consumed. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 134 The traditional importance of sea food to the local economy is now celebrated with the Cardigan Bay Seafood Festival. This seafood festival is held each July at Aberaeron harbour. Aberaeron also hosts an annual Mackerel festival, in late August and early September, in order to celebrate the traditional importance of this fish to the economy of the town. Francis Frith, Flavours of Wales, page 13 Freshwater fish Coracle fishing on the River Teifi Freshwater fish were also a traditional and important part of the Ceredigion diet. The River Teifi is noted for its salmon and sewin. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 130 The source of the river is located near Tregaron. The river then runs through a valley that was once \\"thick with mansions and former great houses\\" before entering the sea at Cardigan. It is said that during the nineteenth century salmon was so plentiful that servants begged not to be fed it more than three times a week. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 130 As a result, 'Teifi salmon sauce' is found in almost every collection of Welsh recipes from the kitchens of the Welsh country houses. Freeman notes that Welsh eighteenth century recipes tend to use a large quantity of butter, which reflects the fashion in most country house cooking of this period. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 66 Lady Llanover, in her book 'First Principles of Good Cookery', gives detailed instructions for crimping fresh-caught salmon in order to 'set' the flesh before the curd (which is the white substance between the flakes of orange flesh) melts and makes the fish oily. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 63 Fennel, which grows wild in Ceredigion, was often used in sauces for fish, especially salmon and mackerel. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 67 Gerald of Wales commented on the spectacular sight of salmon leaping at the waterfalls at Cenarth Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 12 while Bobby Freeman recalls that when she ran a hotel in Pembrokeshire in the 1960s, salmon from the river Teifi would be dropped off by bus outside the hotel, with the bus conductor carrying them in boxes to the kitchen. The fish had been packed in cool, fresh bracken with six or seven big fish to a box. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 61Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 13 Salmon is in season in Wales from February to October, but the main runs of fish tend to be from June to September. When in the river salmon use their energy to produce roe ready for spawning and so the flesh begins to deteriorate quickly. For this reason Pressdee notes that gravid fish, which tend to be darker and thinner, should be avoided and left in the river to spawn. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 82 He also notes that wild salmon are considered to have a more solid and defined texture and a flavour than farmed salmon and comments that this reflects their diet of shellfish, while farmed salmon, although more readily available, tends to have less muscular flesh and a more buttery taste. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 82 Trout are also plentiful in the rivers of Ceredigion and are farmed commercially at Rhydlewis Trout Farm where the trout are raised in pools fed by the rivers Teifi and Ceri and smoked in wooden chambers. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 132 Lamb The flavour of lamb from Welsh Mountain Sheep is influenced by geography. Ceredigion's coastal cliffs are subject to westerly winds which cover the cliffs in salt spray. The spray is caught by goose grass on which the lambs graze and this influences the flavour of the meat. Along estuaries and salt marshes, such as the Dyfi Estuary Mudflats, wild spearmint, samphire and sea beet give the meat a rich flavour, with saline nuances while lamb from upland areas, like Cader Idris, feed off mauve flowering heather (calluna) in summer which gives the meat a more aromatic flavour. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 94 Welsh Mountain Sheep at Llanddewi Brefi - ewes shorn of their coats with Nant Coli stream in the background (photo by Roger Kidd) The flavour of Welsh lamb is also influenced by the seasons. Spring lamb appears on sale from May each year and is sweet and mild-flavoured. Pressdee notes that this makes it ideal for light spring casseroles, particularly if warmth of flavour is required. Autumn lamb, however, acquires a stronger, gamey flavour but can be richer in flavour and can be enhanced by the addition of fresh, wild field mushrooms. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 94, page 98 Although Welsh Mountain Sheep are smaller than other British sheep breeds, it is considered to have a sweeter flavour and to have more meat nearer the bone. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, pages 133-134 Generally, the shoulder of Welsh lamb is more succulent, and has a higher fat content, than the leg. However, due to the difficulty of carving it, shops tend to sell shoulder of lamb already boned and rolled. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 98 Up until the nineteenth century, mutton was a popular dish in Wales. However, due to changes in farming practices and food preferences, it is no longer part of the staple diet. However, it can still be found in Victorian recipe books, where the salting, or 'powdering', of mutton and the preparation of 'Welsh Mutton Hams' was a regular item of daily fare. Mutton was commonly found in Ceredigion restaurants catering for the Victorian tourist trade. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 133 The importance of sheep in the economy of Ceredigion is reflected in one of the banknotes of a now defunct Ceredigion bank called the Aberystwyth and Tregaron Bank, where the number of black sheep depicted on each banknote corresponded to the value of the note in pounds and with the £5 and £10 notes displaying one ram or two rams, respectively. This gave the bank its alternative name of the Black Sheep Bank or Banc y Ddafad Ddu. Banknote of the Aberystwith and Tregaron Bank Pork Pigs have been an important part of the Ceredigion diet since Medieval times and are recorded in the Laws of Hywel Dda. Up until the middle of the twentieth century every cottage would keep a pig in the back yard. Freeman, Bobby: Welsh Country Cookery, Traditional Recipes from the Country Kitchens of Wales, page 45. Talybont, Ceredigion: Y Lolfa Cyf., 1988. As a result, Welsh cookery books usually include several recipes which Freeman classifies as being based on the \\"bacon-plus-potatoes theme\\".Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 115 The killing of the family pig would be a community event and village households would co-ordinate pig killing in order to avoid an over-supply of pork in the village. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 118-119 When a pig was killed, all the parts of the animal which couldn't be salted or eaten would be given to neighbours with each pig providing a stock of faggots, sausages, puddings, brawn and haslet. Haslet and faggots are still popular dishes in Wales and can usually be bought from the local market. Haslet is often called aislet or islet in Wales. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 118-119 Butcher’s shop in Cardigan which also sells vegetables (photo by Ceridwen) Pressdee comments that traditional butchers can be found in Ceredigion that produce dry-salted Welsh bacon and gammon from locally produced pork. The meat is considered to be generally of good value and widely available. He notes that the least expensive cut of pork is 'cig moch', or belly pork. Each farmhouse would traditionally cure its own bacon and the crackling from the belly, if cooked until crisp, was considered to be the most succulent part of a joint. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 108 Sheila Barry recounts the keeping of pigs on Penrallt Farm, Llangranog shortly after World War II. The pigs would be killed during cold weather to keep the meat fresh. Barry recounts that the farm would kill two pigs a year with the first pig being killed in November, or the first week of December. If the pig was killed later than this then the task would overlap with the work of preparing poultry for the Christmas market. The second pig would be killed in early March. The fat from the pig would be rendered into lard which was clarified and stored in large, glazed earthenware jars for use in pastry and for roasting. Barry comments that the lard would keep for years, if covered and stored in a cool dairy. However, the lean meat would need to be eaten within ten days and the custom would be to give packs of meat to neighbours who would reciprocate when their pig was killed. The offal would be used to make brawn and faggots. After being hung for three days the rest of the pig would be cut into sections and salted to make bacon, with the salt being rubbed into the flesh twice a day for three or four weeks. Each bacon joint was then wrapped in fine muslin and hung from hooks in the ceiling of the living room to mature. Barry recalls that the practice ceased on the farm around 1953 as farms became more commercialised. Barry, Sheila: There’s a calf in the sitting room..., pages 70-78. Derby: The Breedon Books Publishing Company Limited, 2003. Glanrafon - an example of a traditional Ceredigion farm Beef Welsh Black cattle are a relatively small but powerful breed of cattle that originates from Wales. They eat a wide variety of vegetation and this gives the meat a good flavour. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 100 At Llanerchaeron, the National Trust has a working farm which includes Welsh black cattle, together with other species of farm animals where they attempt to demonstrate the relationship between a country house, its service courtyard and the home farm and where visitors can see activities from a full year's farming calendar Welsh Black cattle at Cwm Doethie – Mynydd Mallaen (photo by Roger Kidd) Many local farms are family run, such as Golwg y Môr, and regularly supply local restaurants and shops, with cattle grazing on the coastal grass which produces tender and well flavoured meat. Goat Goat also remained a staple in Wales for much longer than in England. This is because goats were more suitable to the rugged Welsh terrain. Goat hams were often known in Wales as 'hung venison'. Although no longer popular, the antiquarian Thomas Pennant writes that in Wales 'hung venison' was a source of cheap and plentiful food during the winter months. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 138-139 Game In Ceredigion, the estates that once formed part of notable Welsh country houses, such as the Trawsgoed Estate, near Aberystwyth, now offer wild shooting for a variety of game (hunting). The Trawsgoed Estate covers over 5,000 acres of marshes and wetland around Tregaron Bog (Cors Caron). Here game includes pheasant, snipe, mallard, Eurasian teal, widgeon and hares. The Monachty Shoot is a long established shoot on a 1500 acre estate near Aberaeron which includes pheasant and duck. Cefngwyn Hall, south of Aberystwyth offers semi-wild duck shooting with 25 pools in 400 acres Pheasant is commercially reared and then released into the wild where it spends one or two seasons feeding on grain, berries, worms, grubs and roots. This diet can lead to the flesh acquiring a deep mellow flavour which is improved if it is hung for several days in a cool, airy place. Pressdee recommends eating pheasant with a very rich old Burgundy wine or Rhone wine and believes that the flavour of a semi-wild bird is better than the flavour of one reared and fed on commercial feed. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 124 In Wales several venison farms have free-range deer and cull their animals when young and tender. Venison can be treated like beef, lamb or pork and many recipes include venison which has a rich flavour. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 127 Rabbits are plentiful in Wales, especially along undisturbed open land and along the shoreline. The meat is tender and delicate and can be used in a variety of ways, including casseroles. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 120 Poultry Most rural families traditionally kept geese or ducks. Geese would feed on the fields after the harvest had been gathered in order to help fatten them quickly. Welsh hill-farms used goose feathers for bedding, while large goose feathers would be used in the kitchen for sweeping the hearth. Smaller wing feathers would be used for brushing flour or oatmeal while baking. Bobby Freeman: Welsh Country Cookery, Traditional Recipes from the Country Kitchens of Wales, page 46. Talybont, Ceredigion: Y Lolfa Cyf., 1988. Goose meat was also used in cawl and Michaelmas Goose, or Gwydd Mihangel, is a recipe where the goose is boiled in water with a bowlful of chopped onions, salt and pepper and thickened with oatmeal. The thick fatty broth was popular during cold weather. Goose cawl also formed part of the feast given by a farmer to his tenants when they paid their rents. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 116 Vegetables The potato has been a staple vegetable in Wales since its introduction and a number of interesting recipes have developed as a result. Potato Harvest Pudding (Poten Ben Fedi), for example, is a traditional Sunday supper dish made during late September and October, once the potato harvest had been collected and storedFreeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 48 Another traditional dish is Roast Potatoes and Bacon (Tatws Rhost a Bacwm), which would be cooked in the pot oven (or ffwrn fach) over the fire until cooked. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 159 The combination of potatoes with bacon is a traditional one in Welsh cuisine, where the relative blandness of the potato is counter-balanced by the saltiness and fat of the bacon. If potato was not available, cabbage would take the place of potatoes to give a Bacon and Cabbage dish (Cig Moch a Chabaits), with the cabbage being cooked in the liquor of the bacon or a boiling ham. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 1159 Although leeks are closely connected with Wales, Freeman notes that there are few recipes specifically made for them. At one time they were the only member of the onion family that grew throughout Wales and thus merited a mention in the Laws of Hywel Dda, together with the cabbage. One notable dish is Pastai Cennin (Leek pasty) which combines leeks with a shortcrust pastry.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 162 Cawl is a soup or broth that was an important dish throughout Wales and would traditionally be eaten with a special cawl-spoon. This was made of wood to avoid burning the mouth on the hot broth. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, pages 106-107 Traditionally, the broth of the cawl would be drunk first and the meat and vegetables eaten second. This is similar to the French dish pot-au-feu, which cawl closely resembles. These days cawl is eaten all at once, although the use of a hand-carved wooden cawl spoon and a wooden bowl may be less common than before. Traditionally, cawl is accompanied by nothing more than a hunk of wholemeal bread and a chunk of cheeseFreeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 9 There is no standard cawl recipe, but in New Quay it was traditionally made on the beach on the first day of August as a special feast for the sailors of the village. One woman would oversee the making of the cawl in a large cauldron, while each family would contribute its portion of the ingredients - either a piece of beef or fresh garden vegetables. Because of the variety of vegetables available during the summer, cawl was considered to be at its best during this time of year and was known as Cawl Awst.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 111 Tregaron has its own cawl recipe, known as Tregaron Broth (Cawl Mamgu Tregaron). This is made from meat and vegetables boiled in water, except for the leeks, which are added later. The vegetables usually include parsnip, potatoes, carrots, swede, and white cabbage while the meat includes bacon and shin beef (beef shank). The ingredients are boiled together with oatmeal to thicken and left simmering for as long as required. The leek is added 10 minutes before serving and the cawl is left to boil.Grant, Welsh Country Cooking, page 23 Cawl is a key part of traditional Welsh cuisine and Bobby Freeman noted that it forms \\"an unspoken part of life\\" in Wales.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 106 Dairy products Teifi cheeses Ceredigion is noted for dairy produce which is due to the quality of its pasture. In the past, milk would be sent daily to London to \\"quench the capital's thirst\\".Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 130 As a result, Ceredigion also has an important dairy industry and, in addition to milk, is noted for its cheese and yoghurt. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 132 Gilli Davies notes that, in Wales, the system of transhumance meant that cheese production remained a farmhouse activity for longer than elsewhere in Britain. During the summer, butter and cheese making would form part of the economy of the hafod, the summer dwelling-place of the Welsh farmer (see Agriculture in Wales). The hafod would be located up in the hills, where the livestock would make the best of the summer grazing. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 147 However, the acid soils of the uplands (highland) mean that hard cheeses are less easy to produce and traditionally the drovers, who would take the sheep on foot to market in England, would often barter sheep for a hard cheese, usually Cheddar cheese, in order to make their 'caws pobi' or welsh rabbit.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 153 Carved butter stamps at Ceredigion Museum (photo by Jopparn) During the twentieth century there was a renaissance in cheese making in Ceredigion. Ty'n Grug is a farm-based cheese producer and is considered to be the 'uncle' of organic cheeses in Wales. It makes cheese from cow, goat and ewe milk and varieties include Teifi, Penbryn and Felin Gernos (from cows' milk), Merlin (from goats' milk) and Acorn (from ewes' milk). The proprietor, Dougall Campbell, was born in Sydney and moved to Ceredigion in 1976. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 130 He became a pioneering figure in the world of Welsh cheese production and is considered to have led the \\"renaissance in farmhouse cheese-making\\". By 1984 the few organic dairy farms in Ceredigion sold their milk to the Milk Marketing Board but without any premium for their organic produce. Campbell established Welsh Organic Foods to support organic milk producers, capitalising on the organic provenance of the milk and turning it into the first organic-cheese making company in Britain. He also helped educate the public on the nature and benefits of organic cheese. The Soil Association has since established the Dougal Campbell Memorial Fund in his honour while The Specialist Cheesemakers Association offers a bursary, known as the Dougal Campbell Cheese Award, for aspiring cheese makers. (Independent obituary) Tyn-y-Llwyn is farm-based cheese producer located at Pontrhydygroes. The farm produces a firm Cheddar- type cheese and has been in production since 1986. Flocks of Anglo-Nubian goat, the Alpine goat and Saanen goat breeds provide milk for the cheese. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 133 farmland south of Penuwch Little Acorn Products was established in 1985 at a time when cheese made from ewes milk was a rarity. The business was started from the kitchen table of Karen and Don Ross, who started by making one cheese a day and recorded the production process in detail. Their ewes' milk cheese resembles an old fashioned Wensleydale. In addition, they make cheeses from cows milk, including a variety called Monks of Strata Florida, named after a famous local monastery. Davies, A Taste of Wales, pages 134-135 Penbryn Organic Farmhouse Cheese is made by Paul Knifton and Andrea Degen, who previously made Gouda cheese in Ireland and Holland respectively. The cheese moulds are filled with curd and wrapped individually by hand and stored for 8-10 months to enhance the flavour to give a traditional taste. Varieties include a Penbryn Mature cheese. Gilli Davies comments that they \\"produce some of the best cheese produced in Wales today\\".Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 134 Teifi Farmhouse Cheese is made at Ffostrasol, Llandysul and is considered to be one of the finest farmhouse cheeses made in Wales. Pressdee, Welsh Coastal Cookery, page 132 Rachel's Organic was established by Rachel Rowland at Brynllys Farm; a 254 acre organic farm in Dolybont, near Borth, that has been owned by four generations of the same family. In 1982, a snow storm prevented access to the farm so, in order not to waste the farm's milk, they made butter for local consumption. Production of butter, yoghurt and cheese soon followed. Rachel's grandmother was a dairy instructor at UCW, Aberystwyth, and was responsible for developing organic methods using scientific principles. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 136 Bread, cakes and puddings Organic wheat is still stone-ground in small flour mills across Wales. The slow grinding of the flour retains the wheat germ in its entirety while the warm, but not hot, friction between the mill stones gently releases the wheat oil and thus retains all the nutrients.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 90 In Ceredigion, Felin Ganol, at Llanrhystud, is an example of a restored flour mill that retains its original machinery. It is the only working water-powered mill in Ceredigion and was visited by the Prince of Wales in 2012.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 94 Bread and cakes were made for daily use and also for special occasions, which usually revolved around the religious or agricultural calendar. Freeman notes that cakes come from the later tradition in Welsh cookery, when the bakestone was replaced by the oven. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 203 Sheep shearing remains one of the major social occasions in Welsh rural life and during this period farmers help each other with the rounding-up of the sheep and the shearing of the wool. At this time the host farm will spend days beforehand making pies, cakes and baked meats. Cacen Gneifo, or Shearing Cake, is a traditional cake made at this time, which is flavoured with caraway seeds. Freeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 38 The Threshing Cake, or Cacen Ddyrnu, is a traditional cake made at threshing time and uses buttermilk and bacon fat, which are always available on Welsh farms. Freeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 43 Teisen Carawe, or Seed Cake, is another cake using caraway seeds. It is one of the oldest of the Welsh egg- raised cakes and is traditionally associated with chapel and Sunday tea in the parlour. Freeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 30 An old Ceredigion recipe is Christmas Cake, or Teisen Ddu Nadolig, which typically includes some home brewed ale.Grant, Welsh Country Cooking, page 57 National Museum of History, built of bricks in 1900, this was a communal bakehouse in Thespian Street, Aberystwyth till 1924. Today, Bara Brith is baked here for sale to visitors Commercial bakeries developed in urban areas during the nineteenth and early twentieth century to satisfy the need of urban dwellers to bake their own bread. They would bring their home-prepared dough to the bakery in baking tins and would pay the baker for baking it. The reason for this is that town houses were fitted with iron ovens attached to kitchen ranges which were not regarded as 'good bakers of bread'. The Derwen Bakehouse was one of three such bakeries in Aberystwyth. It served the local community from around 1900 to 1924 and was re-erected in the National Museum of History during the mid-1980s. It is a functional bakery that allows visitors to the Museum to see bakers at work using traditional wooden appliances, mixing dough and using the large brick oven in the traditional way.Minwel Tibbott, S.: Baking in Wales, pages 5-6. Cardiff: Amgueddfa Genedlaethol Cymru, National Museum of Wales, 1991. Pancakes, which are called poncagen (poncagau) or pancosen (pancos) in Ceredigion, are considered to be as traditional in Wales as cawl. Because they could be quickly made on the bakestone over the fire and would often be made for unexpected visitors, as a birthday treat or eaten at high tea.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 195 Pancakes still remain popular and are considered best made with buttermilk and bicarbonate of soda, rather than ordinary milk. Most recipe books from Welsh country houses include pancake recipes that use cream, which would be considered a special luxury.Freeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 30, page8 Waffles are a more recent addition to Ceredigion cuisine, with local production commencing in the 1980s. Tregroes Waffles is run by Kees Huysmans and Ans Brouwer who arrived in Ceredigion in 1981 from Holland. They started with a simple waffle iron offering their first waffles at a Guy Fawkes party at Henllan in 1984 and have since moved to larger premises in Llandysul. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 132 Trifle and rice pudding remain very popular in west Wales, with Freeman commenting that trifle is the \\"more or less obligatory 'finale' to a special occasion feast\\".Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 174 In the case of rice pudding, this is expected to be rich and creamy.Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 183 In 2012 the Ceredigion Federation of Women’s Institutes published a book of recipes called “Cardi Cuisine” to celebrate their 90th anniversary and the hosting of the WI Wales Conference at Aberystwyth. The spiral bound book contained over 90 recipes from WI members, including some traditional bread and cake recipes, including recipes for Parsnip Bread, Bara Brith, Shearing Cake, Welsh Cakes, Llanddarog Fair Cakes and Welsh Tea Buns.Ceredigion Federation of Women’s Institutes: Cardi Cuisine, Favourite Recipes of Ceredigion WI Members, Aberystwyth: Argraffwyr E. L. Jones Printers, 2012. Fruit Fruit growing tends to be for household use, with each farm having its own apple, plum or damson tree. However, due to the acid soil in upland areas, soft fruit is a rarity, although it may be grown on a commercial basis where the soil is less acid. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 173 Pen Caled is a traditional apple variety from Ceredigion which is a good variety for cider production. It has a full, sharp taste and is low in tannin. It can also be used as a late-season cooking apple. Pren Glas is an apple variety from the St Dogmaels area. It is an early-season eating apple. Both apples are available from commercial growers. Like elsewhere in the country, Welsh apples and fruit varieties may await rediscovery and a full assessment of traditional Welsh horticultural biodiversity remains to be undertaken. Wild fruit is also collected, including blackberry (mwyar), whinberry (llus), wild raspberry (afan) and wild cranberry, which can be found growing in the boggier uplands of Ceredigion. Gooseberry and rhubarb are also commonly grown in gardens. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 176 Fruit tarts, including turnover tarts, were traditionally made on the bakestone without a plate or dish; sugar was only added after the fruit was cooked. This was done by lifting off the pastry lid and then working the sugar into the fruit. Making a tart on the bakestone required skill and the use of a special wooden slice. Freeman, Traditional Food From Wales, page 174 Organic produce Ceredigion farming traditions go back generations, but the influence of alternative lifestyles has added new ideas and philosophies to traditional ways of life and thus enriched the local community. This means that, in addition to traditional Welsh staples, such as butter and bacon, new foods such as pulses, beans and soya milk have supplemented the diet. In addition, there has been a move away from artificially fertilized farm land to organic pasture, together with a growth in horticulture and an increase in the production of high-quality produce. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 130 Drinks Llanllyr mineral water Dà Mhìle is an independent whiskey distillery established in 2012 with help from the Springbank Distillery. It is based at Glynhynod Farm and is reputed to be the first organic, farmhouse distillery in the UK. The distillery produces organic whiskey and offers guided tours by arrangement. It also produces an organic orange liqueur called Dà Mhile Orange 33. Freeman notes that home-brewed beer is \\"a legend\\" in rural Wales, with family recipes being jealously guarded. Freeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 41 One farm that now produces beer commercially is Panteg Farm, at Maen-y-groes where Penlon Cottage Brewery offer beer tastings and events. They produce ten types of ales, lagers and stouts using traditional methods and vegetarian recipes. Celtic Country Wines, is located at Henllan, Llandysul and produces fruit wines, liqueurs and country preserves. The winery accepts visitors and has a gift shop. Traditionally, ginger beer has always been popular as a non-alcoholic alternative to ordinary beer. There are two kinds of Welsh ginger beer, one uses a gingered herb to make 'small' beer and the other uses root ginger.Freeman, Welsh Country Cookery, page 41 Tŷ Nant is a 350 year old farm near Bethania, Ceredigion. The farm has bottled spring water since 1986. The Tŷ Nant brand was established in 1989 and is recognised by its distinctive cobalt blue, glass bottles which won a British Glass Federation design award and were the first bottles to use dark blue glass since Phillip's Milk of Magnesia. Davies, A Taste of Wales, page 133 Llanllyr is a bottled water which has been drawn since 1180 at an organic farm in Talsarn, and is available throughout Wales.

Both PseAAC and PseKNC are of vector descriptor, but the former represents protein or peptide sequences while the latter represents DNA or RNA sequences. To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information for protein and peptide sequences, the PseAAC was proposed by Kuo-Chen Chou. To address the problem of DNA and RNA sequences, the pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC was proposed. For the convenience scientific community, a freely available web server called PseKNC and an open source package called PseKNC-General were developed in 2013 and 2014, respectively, that could convert large-scale sequence datasets to pseudo nucleotide compositions with numerous choices of physicochemical property combinations. PseKNC-General can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions, including conventional k-tuple nucleotide compositions, Moreau–Broto autocorrelation coefficient, Moran autocorrelation coefficient, Geary autocorrelation coefficient, Type I PseKNC and Type II PseKNC.

It begins in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate at Staudernheim on the River Nahe, follows the course of the Glan, crosses the state of Saarland along the Blies and finishes in Lorraine.  Route  The way begins on the Nahe Cycleway. Running past Disibodenberg Abbey and then making its way via Odernheim am Glan and Meisenheim it reaches the Kusel Musikantenland. In the Veldenz town of Lauterecken there is a railway connexion and the option to switch onto the Lauter Valley Cycleway to Kaiserslautern. A few kilometres further on, the trail passes Offenbach- Hundheim and the old Benedictine Provost Church of St. Mary. It then continues initially in a southwesterly direction, then swings south to Altenglan. At Altenglan, a junction with the Fritz-Wunderlich Way runs through Kusel on an old railway trackbed to Freisen. Between Altenglan and Staudernheim, there is a separate draisine route that runs through the Glan valley. The cycleway continues for two kilometres alongside the federal highway. Kübelberg gallows in Sand on the Glan-Blies Cycleway Between Glan-Münchweiler and Niedermohr the Barbarossa Cycleway branches off, running through North Palatinate to Worms. From Glan-Münchweiler the route follows the old trackbed of the Glan Valley Railway via Nanzdietschweiler, with its old washing facility and the preserved mill from 1884, through the Elschbach Tunnel. It continues past the lake of Ohmbachsee to Schönenberg-Kübelberg, where it passes the protected railway station. Next, the way passes Waldmohr with its bog mill and the Eichelscheiderhof. Here it leaves the route of the railway and follows cycle tracks to Homburg. After Beeden the way runs along the River Blies through the Bliesgau Biosphere Reserve. In Wörschweiler, a detour goes to the abbey ruins and the Schwarzenacker Roman Museum. On the next stage, the route reaches Blieskastel with its baroque Altstadt. The route runs along the old embankment of the Blies Valley Railway. The last station on German soil is the Bliesbruck-Reinheim European Culture Park, with a Celtic prince's grave and settlement from the Roman era. Here the way crosses the Franco-German border and comes to an end after Saargemünd (French: Sarreguemines) at the confluence of the Blies and the Saar. In Sarreguemines the Glan-Blies Way is joined from the north by the Saar Cycleway, which runs between Sarreguemines and Völklingen parallel to the Saarland Cycleway. To the south is a junction with the cycling path along the Saar Canal and thus to the French cycle network.Radwege (Voies vertes) in Frankreich  Signage and surfacing  The bidirectional way is signposted throughout. The waymarks along the route give the distances and destinations as well as the logo of the way. The multicoloured logo depicts a beckoning cyclist and bears the inscription Glan- Blies-Weg. The route runs predominantly on asphalt forest tracks, farm tracks and cycle paths.Glan-Blies-Radweg. Tourenplaner Rheinland-Pfalz. Retrieved 30 October 2013.

The band's current line-up consists of four members: leader, vocalist, guitarist, composer and producer Nam Tae-hyun, bassist Jung Hoe-Min, drummer Lee Dong-Geun and guitarist Kang Min-Jun.

Tae-hyun then posted a recruitment announcement online, and eventually met his future bandmate Kim Eui-myeong at a church. Kim Eui-myeong then later introduced Nam Tae-hyun to his musician friends Kang Kun-ku, Jang Won-young, and Choi Yun-hee and together they formed a five member band. Besides Tae-hyun who already had some experience in the entertainment industry, Kang Kun-ku and Kim Eui-myeong were former members of a band. Jang Won-young would often help his fellow musician friends Their first performance was announced by Tae-hyun on his social media on March 25, along with the name of the band, \\"South Club\\". The formation of the band was then made official and Nam Tae-hyun established a music company called \\"South Buyers Club\\" under his name, in order to pursue the musical style that he likes. Tae-hyun then became the leader and main composer, while all the members help with the arrangement adding their own style to the songs.  2017: The beginning, 90  South Club debuted on May 26, 2017, with their first single \\"Hug Me\\", a melancholy song that expresses people’s loneliness. Their first single received a good response from fans and other fellow artists and from there the band started to perform at many events and festivals. On June 18, South Club had their first official public stage at the music festival \\"Smile, Love, Weekend\\", where they gave an album preview and played the songs they have prepared for their first EP. Their first seven-track EP 90 was released on June 27. South Club described their music style as alternative rock with blues as the foundation. Along with the album release, they also released three music videos. \\"Dirty House\\" (더러운 집), \\"I Got the Blues\\", and \\"Liar\\". They spoke about freedom and youth throughout their songs. Their music is heavily inspired by rock bands in the 90's, such as Nirvana. On July 8, the band released their second single \\"NO\\" and the accompanying music video was uploaded on South Club’s official YouTube account. Later that year, Choi Yun- hee wasn't seen performing together with South Club.

On November 18 and 19, South Club held their first official solo concert curated by Kim Tae-won at the Hyundai Card Understage, in Seoul, with the appearances of 10cm, Heize, and Nam Dong-hyun as their guests. Their third single \\"누굴 위한 노래인가요 (Who Is This Song For?)\\" was released through digital music websites on December 5. The song itself was based on Nam Tae-hyun's personal love story. He admitted that at first it was supposed to be a warm love song, but that after his lover left him, he rewrote the song to describe his feelings of getting lost. 180x180px  2018–present: South Club's Europe tour & Japan tour, 20 and other plans At the start of 2018, Tae-hyun announced on his radio show that South Club would be touring across Europe, visiting London, Paris, Cologne, and Madrid in April.

Sheard has held chief economist positions at Lehman Brothers, Nomura Securities, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, and S&P; Global. Prior to entering financial markets in 1995, he was an academic economist based in Australia, Japan and the United States, specializing in the Japanese economy and the economics of firm organization. He is a member of the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on the New Agenda for Fiscal and Monetary Policy, having been a member of the WEF's Global Future Council on the New Economic Agenda (2018-2020) and of its Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System (2010-2012). He is a member of the board of the Foreign Policy Association and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bretton Woods Committee and the Economic Club of New York. He attends and speaks regularly at conferences around the world, and his views on the global economy and economic policy are frequently cited in the international press.  Career  Sheard was Kiyoshi Kojima Postdoctoral Fellow at the Australia-Japan Research Centre,https://ajrc.crawford.anu.edu.au/ ANU, Lecturer in Economics, and later Associate Professor of Economics at Osaka University. He held visiting scholar positions at Osaka University, the Bank of Japan, and Stanford University, where he was also visiting assistant professor of economics. In January 1995, Sheard became Japan Strategist for Baring Asset Management and later Head of Japan Equity Investments. In September 2000, he was appointed Chief Economist for Asia of Lehman Brothers and became Global Chief Economist of Lehman in April 2006. When Lehman failed in September 2008, after a stint at Barclays Capital, in November 2008 Sheard was appointed Global Chief Economist and Head of Economic Research at Nomura Securities, based in New York.https://www.investmentbank.barclays.com/ In June 2012, he moved to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services as Global Chief Economist and Head of Global Economics and Research and a member of the firm's executive committee, later becoming Chief Economist and Executive Vice President of S&P; Global, the parent firm. Sheard served as a member of committees of the Japanese Government's Economic Deliberation Council, in 1997-98 as an appointee of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and in 1998-99 as an appointee of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. He served as a member of the oversight board of the Japanese Government's Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry,https://www.rieti.go.jp/en/ 2001-2006. From 2003 to 2010, Sheard served as a non-executive director of ORIX Corporation, a large Japanese financial services firm.  Contributions  Sheard's academic work analyzed the economic rationale of distinct features of Japanese corporate organization, including the role of multi-tier subcontracting networks in the auto sector ;“Auto production systems in Japan: organizational and locational features,” Australian Geographical Studies, 21(1), pp.46-68, 1983 the role of main banks and interlocking shareholdings in creating an internalized market for corporate control that supported the \\"lifetime\\" employment system;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interlocking- shareholdings.asp“Main banks and internal capital markets in Japan,” Shoken Keizai, 157, pp.255-285, 1986“The main bank system and corporate monitoring and control in Japan,” Journal of Economic Organization and Behavior, 11, pp.399-422, 1989 the informational and risk-sharing role of general trading companies (Sogo shosha) as financial intermediaries;“The Japanese general trading company as an aspect of interfirm risk-sharing,” Journal of the Japanese and International Economies, 3(3), pp.308-322, 1989 and assessing the arguments that Japanese firms avoided short-termism.“Long-termism and the Japanese firm,” in Mitsuaki Okabe (editor), The Structure of the Japanese Economy: Changes on the Domestic and International Fronts, Macmillan Press, pp.25-52, 1994 In the \\"structural impediments\\" debate of the early 1990s, Sheard argued that many of the features criticized as \\"non-tariff barriers\\" or as being anti-competitive were better understood in terms of how firms and markets in Japan were efficiently organized.“The economics of Japanese corporate organization and the ‘structural impediments’ debate,” Japanese Economic Studies, 19(4), pp.30-78, 1991 He pointed out that the common practice of characterizing keiretsu or affiliated enterprise groups in Japan as \\"horizontal groups\\" was confusing because to many foreign observers \\"horizontal\\" connoted within-same-market whereas most of the relationships in question were \\"vertical\\" (between stages of production) or between-market in nature.“Keiretsu, competition, and market access,” in Edward M. Graham and J. David Richardson (editors), Global Competition Policies, Institute for International Economics, pp.501-546, 1997 As a markets economist in Tokyo, Sheard was active in the policy debate, identifying two factors as contributing to Japan's falling into and remaining in deflation: the failure of the government to aggressively recapitalize the banks after it issued a blanket guarantee of deposits in June 1995 and the aggregate demand management policy mix, under macro deleveraging, of \\"timid\\" monetary policy and stop- start fiscal policy.“The Japanese economy: where is it leading in the Asia Pacific?,” in Mari Pangestu and Ligang Song (editors), Japan’s future in East Asia and the Pacific: In honour of Professor Peter Drysdale, Asia Pacific Press, pp.1-30, 2007 After the Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession, Sheard argued that sustained, aggressive monetary and fiscal policy expansion was needed to restore lost aggregate demand in the developed economies.“Navigating historic times,” Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services Ratings Direct, Oct. 8, 2012 He has argued that quantitative easing (QE), far from being inflationary \\"money printing,\\" is best viewed as a \\"debt management operation of the consolidated government\\" whereby the central bank retires government debt securities and refinances them into central bank money, and that, contrary to common parlance, banks cannot \\"lend out\\" their excess reserves. Sheard argues that, QE being a mild form of monetary easing, the unwinding of QE, in principle, is an innocuous process.

Long a critic of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy communication and action,“Japanese Reflation Is In Play, But Hurdles Galore Stand In The Way,” Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services RatingsDirect, Jan. 3, 2013 Sheard has been a strong supporter of the Bank's April 2013 policy shift under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda,\\"Change Of The Guard--And The Deflation Storyline--At The Bank of Japan,” Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services RatingsDirect, March 28, 2013 describing it as the monetary policy equivalent of a Copernican Revolution.

It is an example of a \\"stretch code,\\" or \\"reach code,\\" in that it is an appendix to a mandatory minimum energy code that allows communities to voluntarily adopt a uniform approach to achieving more ambitious levels of energy efficiency in new construction. The BC Energy Step Code consists of a series of specific measurable efficiency targets, and groups them into \\"steps\\" that represent increasing levels of energy-efficiency performance. By gradually adopting one or more steps, a local government can increase the building performance requirements in its community. The regulation is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032. The Government of British Columbia enacted the BC Energy Step Code as regulation on April 6, 2017. It entered into legal force on December 15, 2017.  How it works  The BC Energy Step Code establishes a series of measurable energy-efficiency requirements that builders must meet in communities that reference it in their building and development bylaws. The regulation groups these performance targets into a series of \\"steps\\" of increasing energy efficiency. Step 1 simply requires confirmation that new buildings meet the existing energy- efficiency requirements of the existing BC Building Code. Meanwhile, at the opposite end of the scale, Step 5 for homes represents a home that is net-zero energy ready. A Step 5 home is effectively the most energy-efficient home that can be built today, roughly equivalent to the rigorous Passive house standard. The BC Building Code separates all buildings into two basic categories – Part 9 and Part 3, as follows: * Part 9 buildings refer to houses and small buildings three storeys or less, that have a building area or \\"footprint\\" no more than 600 square metres. This category includes single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes, small apartment buildings, and small stores, offices, and industrial shops. * Part 3 buildings are larger and more complex. They are four storeys and taller, and have a footprint greater than 600 square metres. This category includes larger apartment buildings, condos, shopping malls, office buildings, hospitals, care facilities, schools, churches, theatres, and restaurants. For Part 9 buildings, there are five steps of the BC Energy Step Code; Part 3 buildings have four steps, while commercial buildings have three. Each step represents a more stringent set of energy-efficiency requirements. As communities climb the steps, they gradually increase the level of energy efficiency in their new buildings. The BC Energy Step Code applies to new construction only. For small buildings, Steps 1 to 3 (collectively, the \\"Lower Steps\\") can be achieved using construction techniques and products readily understood and available in today's market; homes built to Steps 4 and 5 (the \\"Upper Steps\\") are more ambitious and may require more training and incentives to achieve. The regulation is performance-based, not prescriptive, in that it does not specify the specific materials and strategies a builder must use. Instead, it sets measurable performance targets that the proposed building must meet. To ensure that builders have the skills and capacity they need to cost-effectively produce higher performance buildings, until 2020, governments that wish to use the BC Energy Step Code may incentivize all steps, but may only require Lower Steps.  What it measures  The BC Energy Step Code measures a building's energy performance via a variety of metrics. The Building Envelope Metrics and the Equipment and Systems Metrics are demonstrated through a whole-building performance simulation, while the Airtightness Metric is demonstrated through an on-site blower door test of the building before occupancy.  Building envelope metrics  * Thermal Energy Demand Intensity (TEDI): The amount of annual heating energy needed to maintain a stable interior temperature, taking into account heat loss through the envelope and passive gains (i.e., the amount of heat gained from solar energy passing through the envelope, or from activities in the home such as cooking and lighting, and that provided by body heat). It is calculated per unit of area of the conditioned space over the course of a year, and expressed in kWh/(m2·year).  Equipment and systems metrics  * Percent Lower than EnerGuide Reference House: An EnerGuide reference house establishes how much energy a home would use if it was built to base building code standards. This metric identifies how much less energy, stated as a percentage, the new home will require compared to the reference house. * Mechanical Energy Use Intensity: The modelled amount of energy used by space heating and cooling, ventilation, and domestic hot water systems, per unit of area, over the course of a year, expressed in kWh/(m2·year). * Total Energy Use Intensity: The modelled amount of total energy used by a building, per unit of area, over the course of a year, expressed in kWh/(m2·year).  Airtightness metrics  * Air Changes per Hour at a 50 Pa Pressure differential, as measured by a blower door test. * Air Leakage Rate: A measure of the rate that air leaks through the building envelope per unit area of the building envelope, as recorded in L/(sm2) at a 75 Pa pressure differential.  Requirements  To meet the requirements of the BC Energy Step Code, builders will work with an energy advisor to check that their plans will meet the energy-performance requirements of a given step. An energy advisor uses software to analyze construction plans and determine the energy efficiency of a building. The builder then begins construction, paying special attention to the building envelope—the walls, windows, doors, and insulation. The energy advisor also tests a building once it is built to see how well it performs. To achieve the Lower Steps, building and design professionals and trades can rely on conventional building designs with careful air-sealing practices, and incrementally incorporate some key elements in the design, building envelope, and equipment and systems. Builders and designers will collaborate with the energy advisor to select the most cost effective way to meet the standard's requirements. These Lower Steps give builders new flexibility in how to achieve modest gains in efficiency through improved envelopes and/or upgraded systems. To achieve the Upper Steps, builders and designers will need to adopt an integrated design approach to building design and may need to incorporate more substantial changes in building design, layout, framing techniques, system selection, and materials. These techniques and materials will be more costly and challenging without additional training and experience.  Origins  In September 2015, the province's Building Safety and Standards branch established an Energy Efficiency Working Group (EEWG) to review policies and regulations that apply to energy efficiency in BC, to seek stakeholder input and offer guidance on how to best implement an Energy Step Code to achieve consistent building energy performance beyond the BC Building Code. The consultations engaged with the building and development sectors, and the trades and professions that support them, as well as local governments, utilities, and other stakeholders, to identify a consistent approach to increasing energy-efficiency standards. In August 2016, the group renamed itself the Stretch Code Implementation Working Group and published its final report and recommendations, including adoption of a Step Code into a voluntary provincial regulation.  The Energy Step Code Council  In mid 2017, the province renamed the group the Energy Step Code Council, and mandated it \\"to support local governments and industry towards smooth uptake of the BC Energy Step Code and help guide market transformation towards higher-performance buildings within B.C.\\" The Energy Step Code Council meets quarterly to support training and capacity building opportunities for local governments, industry, and other stakeholder, communicate what the BC Energy Step Code is and how it may be implemented across the province, and provide advice and clarification on technical aspects of the standard.  Cost implications of adoption  In September 2017, BC Housing, the province's housing authority, and the Energy Step Code Council published the BC Energy Step Code 2017 Metrics Research Study as a comprehensive exploration of the standard's energy, emissions and economic impacts. The research is based on data generated by builders from all across British Columbia, and bills itself as \\"one of the most extensive energy analyses of buildings in Canada.\\" The researchers conclude that meeting the requirements of the Lower Steps of the BC Energy Step Code involve only very modest construction premiums. In most situations, builders can achieve the Lower Steps for less than a 2% construction cost premium above that of a home built to the requirements of the BC Building Code. The construction cost premiums associated with meeting the requirements of Step 1 amounts to just a small fraction of a percent, the report states. In exchange, owners, occupants, and others would enjoy the benefits detailed in the \\"Benefits of adoption\\" section below. In an effort to illustrate how the BC Energy Step Code would impact construction costs in the \\"real world,\\" the study's authors produced a series of hypothetical scenarios for various building types in various cities.  For an apartment in a six-storey building  The Metrics Research report offers an example of the anticipated capital construction cost premium for a hypothetical 730 square foot unit in a six-storey apartment building in Surrey, British Columbia. Units in this hypothetical new building would sell for between CAD$270,000 and CAD$730,000. For this building, the report says meeting the requirements of Step 1 would involve a construction cost premium of CAD$100 per unit above the cost of building to the standard modelling requirements of the BC Building Code. Meeting the requirements of Step 2 would incur A 0.5 percent construction cost premium, about CAD$790 per unit. Meeting the requirements of Step 3 adds about CAD$970 to the per-unit build cost. Finally, the researchers found that building to the very high- performance levels of Step 4 may entail a per-unit construction cost premium of CAD$4,215.  For a home in a six-unit row house  The Metrics Research report also models an example of the anticipated capital construction cost premium for a hypothetical 1,720 square feet unit built into a six-unit row house project in Surrey, B.C. Units in this hypothetical new building would sell for between CAD$550,000 and CAD$800,000. For this building, the researchers conclude that meeting the requirements of Step 1 would involve a construction cost premium of $560 per unit above the cost of building to the BC Building Code. Meeting the requirements of Step 2 would incur a 0.4% construction cost premium, about CAD$1,250 per unit. Meeting the requirements of Step 3 adds about CAD$2,950 to the per-unit build cost. Finally, the report states that building to the highest performance levels may require non- conventional building practices; this would increase construction costs between $5,500 (Step 4) and $9,400 (Step 5) per unit, the study suggests.  Benefits of adoption  Buildings built to higher energy efficiency standard have been shown to provide multiple co-benefits – to home and building owners and occupants, to industry, to the environment, and to the community.  For building owners and occupants  Owners and tenants often prefer high- performance buildings as they require less energy, reducing utility bills. Occupants also prefer them because they better manage: * Temperature, improving comfort. * Fresh air throughout the building, improving health. * Soundproofing, reducing exterior noise.  For industry  The BC Energy Step Code provides industry with a clear sense of where the province is heading on energy efficiency, while giving builders a welcome level of consistency via standardized performance metrics.  For climate change mitigation  If a given community's new homes are likely to be heated with natural gas, the BC Energy Step Code will reduce the amount of that fuel they need to burn to stay comfortable. A well-insulated and well-sealed Step 3 home heated with natural gas will consume much less of the fuel when compared with one built to the minimum code requirements. This will result in fewer carbon emissions.  For economic development  The global green-building market doubles every three years and the value of the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. British Columbia is already a green building design and construction leader, boasting some of highest-performing buildings in North America. Almost 12,000 people work in green architecture and related construction services in BC, while close to 9,000 work in clean energy services. The BC Energy Step Code could open up new local economic development opportunities, and helps unlock a significant export opportunity. At a November 2017 conference, an assistant deputy minister with the Province of British Columbia's Office of Housing and Construction Standards called the BC Energy Step Code \\"a driver of the clean economy.\\"  Geographic availability  The BC Energy Step Code is available to communities to all climate zones across the province for Part 9 buildings, and only to Climate Zone 4 (Lower Mainland and South Vancouver Island) for Part 3 buildings. Future iterations of the standard will increase coverage to all types and all areas. All British Columbia local governments except the City of Vancouver may reference and enforce the BC Energy Step Code in their policies and bylaws. The City of Vancouver has its own building code, and its own high-performance buildings strategy, the Zero Emissions Building Plan.  B.C. local governments referencing the standard  As of a March 2019 survey of 76 local governments, 14 local governments reported that they had implemented the BC Energy Step Code, and 17 local governments reported they were in the process of implementing at the time of the survey.  Related Canadian Policies  In August 2017, British Columbia joined Canada's federal government, represented by Natural Resources Canada, and other provinces and territories in endorsing the Build Smart: Canada's Buildings Strategy, which is a \\"key driver\\" of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The strategy commits signatories to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a \\"net-zero energy ready\\" model building code by 2030. In British Columbia, the BC Energy Step Code serves as a technical policy pathway for British Columbia to deliver on that goal. As of mid-2018, the only other tiered building standard in Canada's is the Toronto Green Standard, which establishes sustainable design requirements for new private and public developments in that city. The Toronto Green Standard consists of stepped levels of performance measures with supporting guidelines that promote sustainable site and building design.  Similar regulations  The New Buildings Institute, a U.S. nonprofit organization advocating for improved energy performance in commercial buildings, describes a stretch code as \\"a locally mandated or incentivized code or alternative compliance path that is more ambitious than the base code, resulting in buildings that achieve higher energy savings.\\" The institute says the codes provide an opportunity to train building and development communities in advanced practices before the underlying energy code is improved. They help accelerate market acceptance and adoption of more stringent energy efficiency codes in the future. Stretch codes can work in tandem with utility incentive programs. In November 2017, the New Buildings Institute released a set of model stretch building code strategies that target 20% better efficiency than current U.S. national building energy codes. The new 20% Stretch Code Provisions address design aspects such as envelope, mechanical, water heating, lighting and plug loads. Other stretch codes are in place in the United States, in Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and California.

The strategy was focused on swing blue states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin where there was a Democratic majority but which they could swing towards Republican with appropriate redistricting. The project was launched in 2010 and estimated to have cost the Republican party around . Effects REDMAP targeted 107 local state legislative races in 16 states, including swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. With the intention of flipping Democratic-majority state legislatures and Democrat-held state governorships for the express purpose of controlling redistricting, REDMAP funded negative ads in lower-profile state legislative races. This helped to give Republicans control of 10 of the 15 states that would be redrawing their districts in 2010. They then used sophisticated software such as Maptitude to devise districts favorable to the Republican party, for example by clustering Democratic voters into a handful of districts and ensuring the rest were drawn to include Republican majorities. The effects of REDMAP first came about in the 2012 United States House of Representatives elections, in which Republicans were able to secure several districts and retain control of the United States House of Representatives by a 33-seat margin despite Democratic candidates collectively receiving over 1 million more votes than Republican candidates. However, in the 2018 US midterm elections, though the GOP won a majority of Senate seats, it lost the house by a portion roughly equal to the popular vote. The redistricting of Wisconsin became the basis of a case before the Supreme Court of the United States, Gill v. Whitford, brought to challenge if the redistricting of that state was considered unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Criticism REDMAP has been criticized as an attempt to gerrymander districts. Critics have noted that the Republican Party won a 33-seat majority in the House of Representatives despite its candidates collectively receiving 1.4 million fewer votes than Democratic candidates. REDMAP has also been criticized for supposedly targeting people of color, particularly African Americans. David Daley, author of the 2016 book Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn't Count, has said that the effects of REDMAP constituted a \\"wholesale political resegregation along both sides of the Mason-Dixon line\\", alleging that redistricting by Republican legislatures redrew maps to \\"pack as many Black and Democratic voters into as few districts as possible\\". Reverend William J. Barber II, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign, has likewise asserted that Republicans \\"cracked, stacked, packed, and bleached Black voters\\".

The perpetrator, Nengmy Vang, upset following a dispute with his wife, fatally shot two employees at the bank where she worked, his wife's lawyer, and a police officer. After a three-hour standoff, Vang was shot by police officers and later died from his wounds. The shooting resulted in the Wisconsin legislature passing \\"Sara's Law\\", named after Sara Quirt Sann, one of the victims. The law \\"makes it a felony to harm or threaten a lawyer, corporation counsel or guardian ad litem for work on a family law case\\".  Family background  According to a Wausau Daily Herald interview with Naly Vang, her marriage to Nengmy had been fraught with trouble over its 25-year tenure. Naly Vang, a Laotian immigrant, met Nengmy when she was 16, and married a year later when Naly was 17 and Nengmy was 21. She had their first of seven children shortly after the marriage began. Around 2007, according to Naly, Nengmy began spending more time away from home, drinking heavily and leaving Naly to run the household. According to family friends, Nemgmy began dancing with other women at these parties, and after checking his phone bills (Naly dealt with the family's finances), she noticed several calls to another woman. According to court records obtained by the Herald, Nengmy was the target of frequent legal action over unpaid credit card balances, and Naly had attempted to rein in her husband's spending, to no avail. In May 2008, Nengmy called the police to report that his wife had broken several appliances while confronting him about a suspected affair. Police arrested Naly on a charge of noncriminal disorderly conduct, and she served no jail time. Though the Vangs' marriage was not especially violent, Nengmy was extremely emotionally abusive, according to Mao Khang, a social worker at a Wausau-based domestic violence organization. Nengmy moved out of the family's house in 2015 and filed for divorce shortly after, hoping for a quick settlement. Nengmy wanted to use the Hmong clan system to resolve the divorce, but Naly wished to use the court system, as she felt it would give her more security towards receiving custody and child support payments. Naly believed that Nengmy was pursuing a relationship with a woman in Laos, as he told her he was planning on moving there after attempting to cash out some of his assets. According to Nengmy Vang's brother, he began acting \\"crazy,\\" and hit their mother after his separation from Naly; he also believed his brother to have a \\"serious mental illness.\\" Police were called to the Vang residence 5 times in late 2015, when Nengmy attempted to remove his belongings, but no arrests resulted. Nengmy threatened that \\"something bad would happen\\" if Naly continued to request alimony payments.  Incident   Marathon Savings Bank  Nengmy Vang phoned his wife, Naly, and demanded that she sign divorce papers within 24 hours, or he would kill her. He arrived at the bank a short time later, and asked Naly to sign the papers, saying \\"Do you want to die now?\\" in Hmong before exiting the bank to go to his car. According to Naly Vang, she knew that her husband kept a handgun in the car, and fearing for her life, fled to a nearby Subway restaurant. From there, she called police around 1 PM to report her husband's confrontation at the bank. Nengmy Vang then returned to the bank with a black bag, loaded his gun, and shot MSB employees Dianne Look and Karen Barclay, who later died from their wounds.  Law offices of Tlusty, Kennedy & Dirks  After shooting the bank tellers, Vang drove to the law offices of Tlusty, Kennedy and Dirks, where his wife's attorney, Sara Quirt Sann, worked. He held two people at gunpoint and demanded to be led to Quirt Sann's office, where he briefly confronted Quirt Sann before killing her.  Standoff at Nengmy Vang's apartment  Vang's final act was to return to his apartment in the town of Weston. As the police set up a safety perimeter around Vang's apartment, a shot rang out, killing Detective Jason Weiland. Weiland's killing began a three-hour standoff, where police and dispatchers attempted to coax Vang out of his apartment, but he refused. Vang called 911 twice during the standoff, expressing remorse for the murders and requesting that news stations send reporters so he could explain his actions. Police turned off power in the apartment, and tore down part of an exterior wall with an armored car, causing Vang to fire a warning shot. Claiming they saw Vang with a gun, an officer fired \\"more than two dozen rounds\\" into Vang's apartment, wounding him. Vang later died of his wounds at a Wausau hospital.  Victims  * Det.

Quirt Sann, 43; attorney at Tlusty, Kennedy & Dirks and Naly Vang's divorce lawyer  Aftermath  The shooting led to the passage of Wisconsin Assembly Bill 825, colloquially known as \\"Sara's Law.\\" Introduced by Schofield assemblyman Patrick Snyder and 8 other assemblypersons (6 Republican, 2 Democrat), the bill reworded a Wisconsin stature with regard to protections against harm for judges, prosecutors and court bailiffs. The revised statute extended the law's protections to family lawyers, guardians ad litem, and corporate lawyers, making the act of threatening any of the named professions a felony punishable by a fine of $10,000 and six years in prison. The bill passed the Wisconsin legislature with no debate, and governor Scott Walker signed the bill into law in February 2018. According to legal scholar Stephen Kerson, the law, which was the first of its kind in the country, could provide a case study into providing better protections for family lawyers.

Medical career  Jones studies medicine at King's College, London and qualified with MRCS, LRCP from Westminster Hospital Medical School in 1939. He stayed on at the hospital to complete his junior house posts. Between 1942 and 1946, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a regimental medical officer to a field artillery regiment in North Africa and Italy. He witnessed the Salerno landing and the attack on Monte Cassino. Declining an elevation in rank, he opted to endure the rest of the war along with his regiment. Returning to England in 1946, Jones continued his surgical training and passed the FRCS in 1948. Afterwards, he joined the surgical team under Sir Clement Price Thomas at the Brompton Hospital and Westminster Hospitals. Baguley and Davyhulme Hospitals appointed Jones as thoracic surgeon in 1955 and Manchester Royal Infirmary took him on in 1960. Also, in 1960, Jones attended the Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco to learn new techniques in open heart surgery. After spending six months with Dr Frank Gerbode, he returned to Westminster Hospital as thoracic surgeon. As Hunterian Professor, he gave a lecture on bronchial sleeve resection in 1958.  Sir Clement Price Thomas  In 1951, Jones spent three weeks as resident surgeon in Buckingham Palace. On 23 September 1951, whilst still in the palace, he had assisted Price Thomas with the pneumonectomy on King George VI’s lung cancer. In return, he was awarded the MVO. The surgery has since been researched and re-enacted by real surgeons in Stephen Daldry's The Crown (TV series).  Later life  Jones enjoyed fishing and antique clocks. Coronary artery disease and an illness resulting in loss of voice limited his activities and resulted in his premature retirement.

It is a reflection on Komunyakaa's first visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa served in Vietnam and was discharged from the Army in 1966, during which time he wrote for army newspaper Southern Cross. It is the second poem written by Komunyakaa about Vietnam. R. S. Gwynn has referred to the poem as \\"the most poignant elegy that has been written about the Vietnam War.\\" Background The poem was his second to deal with the topic of the Vietnam War. He first wrote a poem dealing with Vietnam fourteen years after returning from the war. \\"Facing It\\" was written approximately a year after visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa has said \\"Facing It\\" influenced the other poems of the collection in which it was first published, Dien Cai Dau. Content The poem concerns the speaker's visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a black gabbro wall engraved with the names of American soldiers who died in the war. The wall is polished so that it is reflective. Composition Like jazz, the poem appears to be free of form, but it is in fact split into a verse-bridge-verse structure similar to many jazz songs. The first thirteen lines reflect on the speaker's reaction, and the final thirteen reflect on the reactions of others; these two sections are separated by a shorter section describing the act of finding and touching a name. Context The poem is one of several by Vietnam veterans to deal with memorials. Andrew Palmer and Sally Minogue have contrasted the \\"ambivalent response\\" of \\"Facing It\\" with W. D. Ehrhart's \\"The Invasion of Grenada\\", in which the speaker rejects the idea of a Vietnam memorial and refuses to engage with \\"...that vast black wall of broken lives\\". The poem has been anthologized in a number of collections, and is perhaps Komunyakaa's best known work.

The brass is in front of the monument to Etchingham's ancestors. The Latin inscription under Elizabeth Etchingham identifies her as the first daughter of Thomas and Margaret Etchingham. The text under Agnes Oxenbridge identifies her as the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge. Both Judith M. Bennett in The Lesbian Premodern and Alan Bray in Homosexuality in Renaissance England observed that the arrangement of the memorial brasses resembled those made for married couples, and therefore speculate that the brasses for Oxenbridge and Etchingham represented a particular friendship. This, they infer, may have been a medieval example of Lesbian relationship.

In the satire film, Tran is a supporting character and a Vietnamese political activist who is jailed and \\"downsized\\" (shrunken to five inches, or 12.7 cm, tall) by her country. In the process of escaping her country, she loses her left leg below the knee. The film was directed by Alexander Payne, who wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor. Chau's performance was widely recognized as a standout. Some critics complained that the role was an Asian caricature with the performance involving a heavy Vietnamese accent and broken English. Chau defended the portrayal and considered her character to be more layered. For her performance, she was nominated for several awards for best supporting actress. Fictional appearance In Downsizing, Ngoc Lan Tran is a Vietnamese political activist who is jailed by her government and is \\"downsized\\" to a height of five inches. She and others attempt to smuggle themselves into the United States in a television box, but she becomes the sole survivor of the effort, losing her left leg below the knee. She becomes a house cleaner in Leisureland, and the film's protagonist Paul Safranek notices her and tries to help her with her prosthetic leg. Casting and preparation Hong Chau read that director Alexander Payne was developing a sci-fi satire, and since she had seen all of the director's films, she asked her manager for a copy of the script before knowing there was an Asian female role in the film. Chau submitted an audition tape, which the director received. They both met to discuss the role, and while the filmmakers conducted an international casting search, they ultimately cast Chau. Chau, who is of Vietnamese descent but grew up in the United States, worked on her character's accent by drawing from her personal experience with family members having been first-generation immigrants in the country. Chau said there was a dearth of Vietnamese and Vietnamese-American roles, particularly one with her character's refugee background that reflected her family's. She described the role, \\"Here's this character we normally see in the background and they're not given very much attention in both movies and in life.\\" Chau described her character as \\"Chau sees Ngoc as \\"part dictator, part Mother Teresa and part Charlie Chaplin\\". She modeled her character after the writer Flannery O'Connor and the Honduran environmental activist Berta Cáceres. She also drew inspiration from Akira Kurosawa's 1965 film Red Beard, which features a town doctor and his intern. Chau also sought to portray the amputee character authentically by working with an amputee consultant based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The consultant, who was an amputee like the written character, showed her around a rehabilitation center where she and other amputees had gone through rehab. She also practiced how to walk as if she had a prosthetic leg, and later a pegleg. Chau said, \\"I hope that, in addition to people seeing this role and being inspired that she's an Asian woman, they're also inspired that she's a person with a disability, and I hope that inspires them to write more stories.\\" The actress said the director offered to let Chau change the character's name, but she declined, finding that past Asian characters had names easy for Americans to pronounce. Critical reception Downsizing received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregator website Metacritic, which scored the film 63 out of 100. It sampled 48 critics and identified 26 reviews as positive, 19 as mixed, and 3 as negative. Among the positive reviews, The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday said Chau's performance was \\"spiky, endearing, bracingly direct and touchingly expressive\\". Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said, \\"If there's a standout here, it's Chau, taking a character who could easily have been a saintly martyr and making her funny, bristly, moving and occasionally profane.\\" Richard Roeper, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, said, \\"Hong Chau is brilliant as the fiery and funny and fantastically blunt Ngoc Lan.\\" Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times called Chau's performance \\"wickedly supersized\\". Among the mixed reviews, The Atlantics David Sims said, \\"Chau's performance is energetic and heartfelt, but Ngoc Lan Tran seems to exist only to help Paul realize a truth about himself: He's not going to better himself simply by fleeing to a packaged 'perfect community,' and he needs to recognize the good in him to finally feel comfortable about his place in the world.\\" Time Outs Joshua Rothkopf said, \\"The introduction of a cringeworthy Vietnamese cleaning woman and ex-dissident (Inherent Vices Hong Chau) borders on broken-English caricature.\\" Emily Yoshida, writing for New York magazine's blog Vulture, said, \\"There’s been some divided criticism over Chau's performance, which uses a heavy accent, but is also easily the most interesting and vibrant of the entire cast’s. Ngoc Lan is operating from an entire different scale of human experience than Paul, whose greatest struggle prior to going small was that he and his wife couldn’t afford a bigger house. But Chau does her best to find interesting nooks in the borderline saintly character Payne has written — Ngoc Lan is more than a little abrasive and unsentimental, which is the only redeeming aspect of her and Paul’s wholly unnecessary romance.\\" Voxs Alissa Wilkinson said, \\"Since Downsizings festival run, there's been criticism of Chau's character, who has a heavy accent that is played (quite a lot) for laughs.\\" Wilkinson said Damon's character was \\"not a terribly compelling or interesting person\\" especially next to \\"Chau's character, who is a pragmatic spitfire\\" and Waltz's character. Among the negative reviews, RogerEbert.com's Sheila O'Malley found there to be \\"a lot of problems\\" with the story and said, \\"Because Ngoc Lan is such a strong character, and Chau is so funny and strident and bossy, she takes over the entire film.\\" O'Malley found most side characters, including Ngoc Lan, to be characters \\"more interesting and fleshed-out\\" than Damon's main character. Portrayal of Asian role Following early screenings, several critics and audience members criticized the character Ngoc Lan Tran as an Asian caricature, with the role involving a heavy Vietnamese accent and dialogue in broken English, a reaction that director Alexander Payne and distributor Paramount Pictures did not anticipate since it did not surface during preview screenings. The Guardian said the character's accent and dialogue were \\"milked repeatedly for laughs\\", and ScreenCrush called the role an \\"icky, racist caricature\\". The Independent reported, \\"Some critics... have focused on her accent, claiming her broken English is nothing short of mockery.\\" The Los Angeles Times said, \\"The character has also faced scrutiny from critics over the heavily accented broken English she speaks in a cadence that some say veers into stereotype before the script—and Chau's layered, dimensional performance—makes her a hero.\\" Throughout 2017, Chau was asked repeatedly about the criticism. A website reported that she was \\"steadfastly defending the character from what she felt was misplaced criticism regarding the tastefulness of her portrayal\\". She called the questions about her character's accent \\"dehumanizing\\" and said, \\"When I look at my parents I don't see a stereotype.\\" She described her character as \\"so multifaceted and complex and well-written\\" and said the criticism was solely based on her character's accent. She later added, \\"I didn't want the accent to be the thing people take away most from this movie. I wanted them to really see this woman. I wanted them to feel her heartbeat.\\" The New York Times said many reviewers agreed with her perspective and that the plaudits found her performance likely to result in an Academy Award nomination. In January 2018, Chau said, Salons John Semley wrote, \\"What the reaction to Downsizing['s Asian character] suggests are the real-world growing pains that accompany North America's increasing reliance on the arrival of non-European immigrants.\\" Semley highlighted a 2010 study that showed that participants found statements with \\"heavy Middle Eastern, European or Asian accents\\" were less truthful than those from native English speakers. He said, \\"It seems reasonable enough to believe that viewers calling out Alexander Payne, or Thai-Vietnamese actress Hong Chau herself, as troubling or in poor taste are in fact dealing with their own built-in cognitive mis-recognition, as they struggle with internalized accent discrimination.\\" Tran is depicted as Christian, despite 85% of Vietnamese people practicing Buddhism and less than 7% of them practicing Christianity. Bright Lights Film Journals Malcolm Alsett said Downsizing \\"has a Christian message of goodness\\" and criticized the Christian depiction of Tran, \\"Yes, a broader American audience gets to perceive her actions in a way they can identify with as churchgoers. Unfortunately, it aids the persistence of a construct of goodness and social responsibility being the sole domain of Christianity, the font of all that is moral and ethical according to many Westerners.\\" Portrayal of disability Literary critic Adam Mars-Jones said while films like Forrest Gump and Logan Lucky have \\"contorted messages that are sent when physically unimpaired actors occupy non-standard bodies thanks to the magic of special effects\\", the addition of Hong Chau as Ngoc Lan Tran to Downsizing was \\"putting this multiply marginal existence close to its centre\\". Mars-Jones said, \\"This angry woman becomes something infinitely rarer in films than a sexual object – a sexual subject, whose desire rather than her desirability takes charge of events.\\" Performance recognition Hong Chau was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for a Screen Actors Guild Award for best supporting female actor. Vanity Fair wrote, \\"Chau steals every scene away from Damon and her other starry co-stars, including Kristen Wiig, Christoph Waltz, and Laura Dern.\\" References Category:Female characters in film Category:Fictional activists Category:Fictional amputees Category:Fictional Vietnamese people ","title":"Ngoc Lan Tran"},{"id":"56165136","text":"The 2008 Saint Francis Cougars football team represented the University of Saint Francis, located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in the 2008 NAIA football season.

Nicolucci became a confidante of Vito Rizzuto, who went on a trip to Venezuela in 1984 where they met the allied Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan, regarded as drug specialists. That same year, a probe into Nicolucci's drug trafficking by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) found 12 kilograms of cocaine at Vancouver International Airport in false bottom suitcases intended for pick up by Montreal associate William Papier. The RCMP kept close surveillance on Nicolucci and Papier in Montreal through wiretaps, and even followed them by plane to Caracas, Venezuela where they received help from the United States Embassy in Venezuela, and bugged the mobsters hotel rooms. In 1985, the RCMP amassed enough evidence on Nicolucci and Papier, and the two were convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison in Montreal Superior Court in relation to the Vancouver haul; they appealed, but the verdict was upheld. Release, kidnapping and another sentencing In 1991, serving less than half his sentence, Nicolucci was released on parole. Within months of Nicolucci's release, he was money laundering, moving $31 million through a phony currency exchange in Montreal secretly run by the RCMP in an elaborate sting operation, called Project Compote. Officers traced a $1.7-million purchase of 280 kilograms of cocaine made by Nicolucci on behalf of Vito Rizzuto. However, Nicolucci refused to pay the debt to the Colombian Cali cartel, claiming the cocaine was of poor quality. As a result, the Colombians kidnapped Nicolucci from Castel Tina on August 2, 1994, a Montreal strip club he managed, and smuggled him across the border to Miami, Florida, and then into Colombia. With an international warrant for Nicolucci's arrest, the Colombian police found Nicolucci in a house in Cali, Colombia in February 1995. He was extradited back to Canada and brought back to Montreal on May 30, 1996. Nicolucci was found guilty of 437 charges for drug trafficking and money laundering, and sentenced to 19 years in prison. Later years Nicolucci was paroled on Statutory Release in 2012.

He is renowned for participating in the first-ever deathmatch in Japanese wrestling history on December 10, 1989 and is also credited for participating in a Piranha Deathmatch against Kendo Nagasaki on August 19, 1996, which has been considered to be the most popular and greatest deathmatch in Japanese wrestling history by wrestling journalists and many sports websites and Matsunaga has received critical acclaim for his performance. Matsunaga began his career in FMW where he specialized in the deathmatch wrestling style and adopted it as his own trademark style. He competed in many infamous deathmatches in W*ING and high-profile feuds with Mr. Pogo, Freddy Krueger and Leatherface in many successful deathmatches earned him the moniker of \\"Mr. Danger\\". After working as W*ING's ace from 1992-1993, Matsunaga left the company and returned to FMW where he headlined the successful 1993 Year End Spectacular event against Atsushi Onita. After an alliance with Onita, Matsunaga formed the W*ING Alliance to feud with FMW and avenge the demise of W*ING from FMW. Initially considered to be Onita's successor as FMW's ace, Matsunaga was demoted from his role and failed to gain prominence in FMW and ultimately quit the company in 1996. He then joined BJW and helped the promotion revolutionize in deathmatch wrestling and became a two-time Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion in the company before quitting in 2001. Professional wrestling career Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (1989-1990) Matsunaga was initially trained in martial arts and worked for the World Karate Association (WKA) organization. He received the training of professional wrestling from fellow karateka Masashi Aoyagi and made his wrestling debut for Atsushi Onita's Grudge in Nagoya event promoted under the Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) banner on October 6, 1989, by defeating Billy Mack. FMW would bring in martial artists and several fighters to combine matches between professional wrestlers and martial artists and Matsunaga would be roped in to tour with FMW for a few more shows as part of FMW's working partnership with WKA. Matsunaga headlined the Battle Creation event on December 10 at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo by teaming with Jerry Blayman against Onita and Tarzan Goto in the company's first-ever barbed wire deathmatch and the first-ever deathmatch in Japan, which Matsunaga and Blayman lost. This match would set the stage for Matsunaga to establish himself as a deathmatch wrestler. Matsunaga then participated in the Battle Resistance Tournament on January 7, 1990, in which he defeated Katsuji Ueda via disqualification in the first round before losing to eventual winner Masanobu Kurisu in the quarterfinals. New Japan Pro Wrestling (1991) Matsunaga left FMW after the partnership of FMW and WKA ended. He worked two shows for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in the summer of 1991 in which he traded wins with Masashi Aoyagi. Wrestling International New Generations (1991-1993) Matsunaga joined the newly upstart deathmatch wrestling promotion Wrestling International New Generations (W*ING) later that year, making his debut on September 20 by defeating Nobuhiro Tsurumaki. He was soon placed in a rivalry against the company's top villain Mr. Pogo and was pushed as the promotion's top fan favorite and the company's ace. After having faced off against each other in many tag team matches throughout the late 1991, Matsunaga and Pogo competed in their first singles match against one another in a Scramble Bunkhouse Barbed Wire Baseball Bat Deathmatch on March 8, 1992 at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, which Matsunaga lost. Matsunaga rebounded by defeating Pogo in a Fire Deathmatch at One Night One Soul. Matsunaga competed in many memorable deathmatches throughout 1992 and his rivalry with Mr. Pogo was considered a classic. He was then involved in a feud with Leatherface, to whom he lost in a Barbed Wire Deathmatch on October 28. He then suffered another loss against Leatherface in a Spike Nail Deathmatch at We Love W*ING. On April 3, 1993, Matsunaga won his first title, the promotion's World Tag Team Championship with Yukihiro Kanemura by defeating Freddie Krueger and Leatherface. He vacated the title only six days later to concentrate on his ongoing feud with Leatherface. On May 5, Matsunaga defeated Leatherface in a Spike Nail Deathmatch to gain his first singles win over his nemesis. Matsunaga then defeated Mr. Pogo in a Scramble Bunkhouse Deathmatch in their last meeting against each other in W*ING as Pogo would leave the company afterwards due to a contract dispute and return to FMW. Following Pogo's departure, Matsunaga continued to feud with Freddie Krueger, Leatherface and The Headhunters throughout the summer of 1993. He also made an appearance for Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the United States on the August 31 episode of Hardcore TV by teaming with Miguelito Perez to wrestle The Headhunters to a double disqualification. He then toured Mexico to wrestle on two shows for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA). Matsunaga's final match in W*ING was a WarGames match, in which Matsunaga, Crash the Terminator and W*ING Kanemura lost to Freddie Krueger, Jado and Gedo at Best Champ on August 25. Return to FMW (1993-1996) Matsunaga followed his rival Mr. Pogo and left W*ING to return to FMW on September 15, 1993 as a villain. He teamed with Pogo to defeat Atsushi Onita and Mr. Gannosuke in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Street Fight Deathmatch. Matsunaga feuded with Onita throughout the fall of 1993 and he challenged Onita for the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship in a highly anticipated No Ropes Barbed Wire Deathmatch between the two at Year End Spectacular, which was promoted as the first-ever meeting between FMW's ace and W*ING's ace. Onita retained the title. After the match, Matsunaga made friends with Onita and turned fan favorite as he joined the FMW side to feud with Pogo and his entourage. At FMW 5th Anniversary Show on May 5, 1994, Matsunaga and Tarzan Goto unsuccessfully challenged Pogo and Hisakatsu Oya for the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. On July 31, Matsunaga teamed with Atsushi Onita to defeat Pogo and Oya for the tag team championship. As a result, Matsunaga renewed his W*ING-era rivalry with Mr. Pogo as the two clashed in a Street Fight Deathmatch at Summer Spectacular, which Matsunaga lost. Matsunaga had gained fame for his deathmatch wrestling style and was considered by Onita to succeed him as FMW's ace after Onita's retirement at FMW 6th Anniversary Show but Matsunaga's box office drawing power was considered weak by management and the management had to change their mind. On September 7, former W*ING wrestler Yukihiro Kanemura debuted in FMW and quickly joined Mr. Pogo and convinced Matsunaga to join them but a reluctant Matsunaga did not agree to the offer. Matsunaga met Kanemura at a hospital where Kanemura was being treated for some burns suffered in a match and Onita got the pictures of the meeting and accused Matsunaga of having turned on FMW and joined Kanemura which upset Matsunaga and he broke up with Onita and turned on FMW to form W*ING Alliance with Kanemura and Pogo to become a villain and feud with FMW. At 6th Anniversary Show on May 5, 1995, the W*ING team of Matsunaga, Hido and Hideki Hosaka lost to Takashi Ishikawa, Apollo Sagawa and Kishin Kawabata. Matsunaga's stock began dropping in FMW and he was mainly utilized in the mid-card. Following Onita's retirement, Matsunaga and Pogo continued their rivalry to maintain the deathmatch wrestling in FMW. Matsunaga would enter the Grand Slam Tournament for the vacant Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship, in which he scored eight points and lost his last match in the tournament against Hayabusa on September 24. After the loss, Matsunaga showed respect to Hayabusa and teased an alliance between FMW and W*ING as the two defeated W*ING Kanemura and Masato Tanaka in a tag team match on October 28. The four men formed an alliance while Super Leather and Hido grew upset at Matsunaga and Kanemura for turning on W*ING and joining FMW and the two joined Lethal Weapon. This turned out to be a ruse as Matsunaga turned on Hayabusa during a match against Mr. Pogo and Super Leather on November 20 and then Matsunaga and Kanemura turned on FMW and Leather and Hido turned on Lethal Weapon to reform W*ING. This was where W*ING regained its spot as the top villainous group and feuded with FMW and Lethal Weapon. On February 23, 1996, Matsunaga, Hido and W*ING Kanemura lost to Masato Tanaka, Ricky Fuji and Tetsuhiro Kuroda in the first-ever WarGames match in FMW history. After the match, Víctor Quiñones debuted in FMW and led The Headhunters in attacking FMW and W*ING and then Quinones formed Puerto Rican Army in an attempt to take over FMW. FMW and W*ING joined forces and W*ING turned into a fan favorite group. Matsunaga lost to longtime rival Mr. Pogo in a Barbed Wire Double Hell Deathmatch on March 15. Matsunaga was initially scheduled to take on Abdullah the Butcher in a high-profile Barbwire Caribbean Glass Double Hell Deathmatch at FMW 7th Anniversary Show but then Cactus Jack was selected in Abdullah's place. Jack was contracted to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) at the time and WWF did not allow Jack to compete against Matsunaga due to Matsunaga's Hepatitis B and Matsunaga was pulled out of the match by FMW and replaced by W*ING Kanemura. Matsunaga would instead team with Hideki Hosaka and Hido to defeat Miguel Perez, Shoji Nakamaki and Toryu. This would be his last appearance with the company as Matsunaga left FMW due to being unhappy with his spot in the company. Big Japan Pro Wrestling (1996-2001) Matsunaga debuted for the new rising deathmatch promotion Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) on July 19, 1996 by teaming with Shoji Nakamaki to defeat Kendo Nagasaki and Seiji Yamakawa in a No Ropes Barbed Wire, Scaffold, Table and Barbed Wire Boards Elimination Deathmatch to begin feuding with Nagasaki. Matsunaga defeated Nagasaki in a singles match on August 5. At Summer Night Dream, Matsunaga competed against Nagasaki in a high-profile Yokohama Amazon River Piranha and Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch, which Nagasaki won. The match earned critical acclaim and would become very popular in Japan and considered to be a pioneer in the popularity and success of deathmatch wrestling in Japan. It was considered by many to be the best deathmatch in Japanese wrestling history. Daniel Massey of Bleacher Report commented \\"The piranhas took a chunk out of Matsunaga’s chest and he looked in terrible pain when he left the arena. I don’t wish that on anyone, but he chose to wrestle there and in Japan—had they have been fobbed off with a rubbish ending, there would have been a riot. That does not mean I condone the actions, but that’s what makes it great. The final reason this match was the greatest Death Match of all time was because the wrestlers were so good. Matsunaga was already synonymous with the Death Match format and was considered a veteran, so this new concept of piranhas made it more exciting, as even he hadn’t encountered anything like it before. The two wrestlers had a certain chemistry in the ring, and to hold an audience for 20 minutes with a tank of piranhas in the middle of the ring is no easy feat.\\" Ryan Byers of 411mania commented \\"This probably seemed like a fairly revolutionary little match when it first occurred, and the stipulation upon which the match was built is something that has rarely if ever been duplicated. However, if you take away the piranha, there’s nothing that separates it from five hundred other deathmatches that we have seen throughout the years\\", with \\"The match is still well worth watching for curiosity’s sake, but I can’t imagine going out of your way to watch it if you’re interesting in seeing a top of the line deathmatch.\\" Matsunaga competed in a variety of deathmatches during the early years of BJW and helped the promotion to make a mark in the deathmatch wrestling fame in Japan. In the summer of 1998, Matsunaga participated in a tournament to crown the inaugural Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion, losing to The Great Pogo in the final in a Glass and Fire Coffin Cremation Deathmatch on August 9. On August 23, Matsunaga defeated Pogo in a Glass and Fire Coffin Cremation Deathmatch to win the title. Matsunaga lost the title to Shadow WX in a 3-Way Board Alligator Deathmatch on September 23. On August 19, 2001, Matsunaga defeated Zandig in a 200 lighttubes and thumbtack and glass board deathmatch to win his second Deathmatch Heavyweight Championship. Matsunaga lost the title back to Zandig at Ante Up. This was his last appearance with BJW as he left the company after losing the title. Independent circuit (2002-2009) Matsunaga competed as a freelancer in the Japanese independent circuit during the last few years of his career. On September 16, 2002, Matsunaga attacked Mammoth Sasaki with a baseball bat during Sasaki's match against Hisakatsu Oya for the Wrestlings Marvelous Future (WMF) promotion. A match was made between Matsunaga and Sasaki which stipulated that if Matsunaga won then he would be allowed to compete in WMF and deathmatches would also be legal in the company and if he lost then he would be banned from competing in WMF.

Paulette was reported to have disappeared from her home on 22 March 2010, and her family began a campaign through media, advertisements, and social networks to find Paulette. Paulette's body was found in her own room wrapped in sheets between the mattress and the foot of the bed, the same room where her mother had offered interviews and that had been searched by experts from various agencies, including the utilization of search and rescue dogs. The body was discovered on 31 March due to the smell of putrefaction. Her death was ruled accidental by Alberto Bazbaz, General Attorney for the State of Mexico, who said his investigation concluded that Paulette died during the night after she turned herself around in bed and ended up at the foot, and died by suffocating, described as \\"mechanical asphyxia by obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression\\". Paulette's body was buried at Panteón Francés in Mexico City in 2010; her remains were exhumed and cremated on 3 May 2017, after authorities considered that the remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.  Case   Paulette's disappearance  On the night of Sunday 21 March 2010, Paulette arrived from Valle de Bravo to her home, located in Huixquilucan, accompanied by her sister and her father, Mauricio Gebara. The mother of the girls, Lizette Farah, awaited their arrival to put them to bed, which she did. On the morning of 22 March one of Paulette's two nannies, Erika, entered the room to wake the girl, but could not find her. She notified Lizette and began searching the building. Mauricio Gebara informed his sister of the disappearance of his daughter, and his sister informed the Huixquilucan authorities. Later, the mayor, Alfredo del Mazo Maza, notified the Attorney General of State of Mexico, Alberto Bazbaz. After the initial search of the apartment building, Paulette's family claimed they could not find her. There were no signs of theft or kidnapping; the locks were intact, as were the windows and doors. The housing complex had surveillance, but no evidence of Paulette leaving or being taken was found. Paulette could not go out alone due to a motor and language disability.  Search for Paulette and false statements of her disappearance  In the afternoon, the Attorney General of the State of Mexico released a poster with a photo of Paulette and information about her age, appearance and physical deficiencies. Paulette's aunt, Arlette Farah, sent e-mails and uploaded a photo to social networks, where the news quickly spread, prompting a large response. In the evening, Lizette Farah released a message on television to the alleged abductor asking that her daughter be returned to her, saying that she could be left in a shopping center or a crowded place and there would be no reprisal. After the announcement, she distributed flyers with Paulette's face, put up billboards, and placed advertisements on television and public transport. Mauricio also appeared in the media, asking that his daughter be returned to him. He recalled that he had gone out to work on the morning of Monday, the 22nd of March, when Paulette had apparently disappeared. On March 29h, The Attorney General of the State of Mexico announced that Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah, Paulette's parents, as well as the sisters Erika and Martha Casimiro, Paulette's nannies, would be placed under a restriction order due to falsehoods and inconsistencies in their statements. On March 30th, Paulette's parents spent several hours at the Mexican police station before being transferred to a hotel to fulfill their restriction order. The same day, police experts placed blankets at the home for a reconstruction of events.  Discovery of the body and autopsy  On 31 March at around 2:00 am, Paulette's dead body was found in her bedroom. In the video prepared by the investigators and leaked to the public, one voice is heard saying \\"she was severely beaten\\" while examining the stained sheets. However, this statement was almost immediately refuted by General Attorney Alberto Bazbaz. Paulette had died accidentally due to \\"mechanical asphyxia due to obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression\\", he said. An autopsy revealed that Paulette slept with an \\"orthopaedic cloth\\" over her mouth, which was placed every night to prevent her from sleeping with her mouth open; that her body was not manipulated after her death; and that she had eaten food at least five hours before her death. The body had two segments of rectangular adhesive cloth in vertical position on both cheeks, in addition to signs of a blow to the left elbow and knee. The official findings, however, indicated no signs of physical or sexual violence. The autopsy also established that her death occurred between five and nine days before the analysis was made, establishing that she could have died from the first day. This was reported on 31 March, although they failed to reveal the exact date and hour of her death. The official report also included mention that no traces of drugs or toxic substances in the body that could have affected the girl's consciousness. The conclusion was that Paulette \\"by her own means\\" moved on the bed and accidentally fell headlong into a space at the foot of her bed, where she died of asphyxiation, and subsequently remained there unnoticed for nine days.  Aftermath and Paulette's remains  On 3 April, Paulette's mother, Lizette Farah, initiated an amparo proceeding against the restriction order, claiming that she had not been involved in the events that caused her daughter's death. Specialists indicated that the woman suffered from personality disorders. During the procedure, Mrs. Farah became subject to indictment. On 4 April a judge granted freedom to Paulette's parents and nannies. Mauricio Gebara left the hotel where he was staying at 10:20; Lizette Farah, main suspect, at 11:00; and the nannies, Erika and Martha Casimiro, at noon. None could leave the country because the inquiries continued. On 5 April, in separate interviews, Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah accused each other, Lizette claiming that her husband blamed her for Paulette's death, Mauricio that the death could not have been just an accident and that he could not completely trust his wife. On 6 April, Paulette's body was buried at Panteón Francés in Mexico City. The funeral procession was headed by the girl's mother; the Gebara family were not allowed to attend the burial according to an \\"agreement\\". On 7 April, The Gebara family denied Lizette Farah's request to see her other daughter, Lizette, seven years old, who had stayed with her father's family since Sunday, 4 April. On 10 May, The Attorney General of the Federal District, who also collaborated in the case at the request of her counterpart in the State of Mexico, granted the custody of Paulette's sister to her mother, Lizette Farah, who brought a complaint against her husband demanding custody of the girl. On 26 May, although Alberto Bazbaz defended the investigation and conclusions of the case, he resigned his position as head of the Attorney General of the State of Mexico, saying that an attorney general needs confidence to act effectively and that he had lost this confidence due to the questioning of his actions in the investigation of the death of Paulette Gebara Farah. More than seven years later on 3 May 2017, Paulette's body was exhumed from her grave and cremated, since authorities considered that her remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.  Controversies   Statements by Paulette's nannies  Paulette's nannies, Ericka and Martha Casimiro, insisted that the girl's body was not under her mattress, with Martha stating: and Ericka stating:  Statements by Amanda de la Rosa  A close friend of Lizette Farah, Amanda de la Rosa, was allowed to live in the Gebara's house for several days immediately following the girl's disappearance. De la Rosa slept in Paulette's room which was not secured by the authorities. In the time she spent in the house, the bed was made on a daily basis, and nobody noticed the girl's body or the bloody stains on the sheets as they appear on the forensic video. As a result, Amanda was also investigated as a possible suspect, but no charges were filed. At the end of the investigation, she wrote a book titled Where's Paulette? narrating the events from her personal perspective questioning the discrepancies between the facts and the authorities' statements.  Forensics Video  Nine days after her disappearance, a team of 3 forensic experts enter Paulette's room at 2:00 in the morning, go straight to the bed and started taking measurements, loudly stating its characteristics and recording their activities on video. At some point, one of them declares in a loud and clear voice, twice in a row, that Paulette \\"was severely beaten\\" to death, and a few moments after, the forensic expert at his right removes the bed's blanket to reveal two large blood stains, one of them as big as an adult's head. The same man walks to the front of the bed and with the help of another forensic expert, removes all the sheets to reveal Paulette's corpse, partially hidden on one side of the mattress. Although the local authorities gave the video to the press as a document to prove how the body was found, there are several doubts about its authenticity. Most experts agree that it is a reenactment, and not a real-time event, which may explain how one of the forensic experts could know that Paulette was beaten before any evidence was found. It would also explain the placement of the camera and the position of the forensic experts in the exact place to be able to show all the elements to the public without any obstruction. It has also been noted that none of those present seems to show any surprise when discovering the body, and they even continue narrating the events with a monotonous and mechanical voice, as if they were repeating a badly rehearsed script. The time the video was recorded is very unusual, too. Such legal procedures are usually performed in the daytime. The biggest controversy regarding this video is that as soon as it was released, General Attorney Bazbaz publicly stated that the images proved that Paulette had accidentally died from suffocation, avoiding any mention of violence. In later interviews or statements to the press, the latter was not mentioned again and the official cause of death was ruled as an unfortunate accident.  Autopsy  Paulette disappeared on March 21. Her body was found on March 31, nine days later. The initial autopsy report established March 28 as the probable date of her death. The forensic expert in charge of the investigation confirmed that an unidentified high command of the state asked him to correct the date of the death, establishing a non-specific time between March 21 and 26 as the official date of death. The exact day and hour was never revealed to the public. The cause of death, ruled as an accident caused by mechanical asphyxia, does not explain the stains showed in the forensics video.  Recording between Paulette's mother and older sister  During the investigation of the case, a recording between Paulette's mother, Lizette, and her then 7-year-old sister, also named Lizette, was released, in which she tells her daughter not to say anything of Paulette's disappearance, so that they would not be blamed, with the following words: At first Lizette denied this, saying that the recording was edited so it sounded like she was telling her daughter to hide any information. Later, however, she accepted that these were the words she said, stating, \\"I had the conversation with my daughter, but not in the context they showed it.\\"  Paulette's pajamas  In 2010 via YouTube, a video titled \\"'The strange case of Paulette's pajamas\\" was taken by experts and disseminated in some media; the video makes a comparison between photographs of Paulette's body dressed in blue and red pajamas with reindeer figures, with an interview with her mother previously recorded several days before the girl's corpse found in which the same pajamas appear on the girl's room. After this discovery was made public, the television network aired all the footage without cuts, including all preparation prior to the interview. As Lizette and the reporter in charge of the interview examine various items owned by Paulette, the aforementioned pajamas appear. When asked directly, Lizette states that the pajamas belong to Paulette's sister, and are discarded by the news reporter as interview material, being placed aside on the bed, where the audience identified it. However, the presentation of the video without cuts caused more doubts. The audience immediately questioned why the sister's clothes were among Paulette's belongings, and as it could be seen in subsequent days in continuous interviews, those pajamas were placed in Paulette's closet. It was also questioned why the authorities were never informed that the family had a second set of pajamas identical to the one the girl was wearing at the time of her disappearance, and later after finding the girl's body, it was not known what happened to those pajamas. The public was very surprised that during all the previous preparation of the interview, and especially when reviewing the personal objects of her daughter, Lizette did not show any pain, grief, or concern.

Page 17 Life His father was Hugo Selchow. His wife was Erna Selchow and he had one daughter called Gitta. He was educated in Oppeln until 1906 when he became a soldier. He was initially assigned to the Infantry, then in 1912 he was transferred to Signal Corps (Nachrichten Telegrafen Bataillon) in Frankfurt (Oder). Military He served with the German Army of World War I as a signal officer with the troop. Selchow stated that even in the midst of World War I, he pointed out to the Chief Signal Office that much of the work being done in the German Army Signal Corps belonged properly to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs because of its diplomatic nature. The Chief Signal Officer did not agree with this statement and during World War I much of the work done by the Army was diplomatic in nature. Directly after the war, Selchow entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he organized the cipher bureau. He brought with him several soldiers who had been with him during World War I. These were Schauffler, Paschke, Zastrow, Brandes, Hoffman and Kunze. He is listed as a Principal Foreign Office Specialist (Vortragender Legationsrat) on 1 November 1935, with the rank of Minister in 1945. In mid-April 1947, Selchow moved to Wedel in Hamburgh. After the war Selchow maintained contact with some of his colleagues. Little is known about his abilities, but statements from personnel in other cipher bureaus imply that he was jealous and secretive. His Pers Z S staff characterized him as a competent administrator who knew little about cryptography and cryptanalysis. Selchow was somewhat of a Europhile and detested the Nazi Party. With the advent of Adolf Hitler in 1933 and Hermann Göring's Forschungsamt cipher bureau encroached upon the field of the Pers Z S, which was the interception and processing of diplomatic ciphers. Selchow at the time fervently wished to resign by was persuaded to stay by von Bülow, who until 1938 was Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when he died. When Joachim von Ribbentrop, the new Foreign Minister, he lost a lot of supervisory power, and was restricted in duties. He was forced to join the Nazi Party in 1941. During World War II, he had no exact knowledge of the messages passed between different parties, and took no part in any matters pertaining to diplomacy. He remained head of the cipher bureau until May 1945. After World War II In 1950, the Federal Foreign Office tasked Selchow along with Erich Hüttenhain, Heinz Kuntze and Rudolf Schauffler to form a cryptographic service under the direction of Adolf Paschke that was called Section 114. The service was to act as a cypher bureau for the Central office of Encryption (ZfCh) () that had been previously created in 1947 and was located at Camp King. In 1955 the unit was disbanded as West Germany was rearming and a new unit was to be created. In 1956 all the equipment and resources of the unit were transferred to the Federal Intelligence Service (Germany). In 1989 the unit was renamed to ZFI ().

He was the founder of the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, the colony's first successful brewery. History Primrose was the son of a distiller in Carsebridge, near Alloa, Scotland. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh, and on leaving school he joined his father's establishment, where he remained for some time, gaining sound practical and scientific knowledge of the arts of brewing and distilling. He gained further experience managing a distillery for the Messrs. Shea, of Belfast, then that of Beamish, in Cork. He remained with them for several years, only leaving them to establish a brewery on his own account on the Isle of Man. He was then attracted to Australia, with the prospect of managing a large established distillery in Sydney. Primrose arrived in Adelaide aboard Ariadne in August 1839 and decided to travel no further. Shortly after his arrival he set up a distillery in partnership with John Richmond. After carrying it on for about two years he ceased operation because the Government demanded payment of duty upon all spirit manufactured in the colony at the same rate as if it had been imported. Workers at Union Brewery, James Place c. 1890 Primrose then turned his attention to brewing, and in 1841 took over the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, which had been founded on Robert Cock's Town Acre 80, east corner Rundle Street and James Place, by Daniel Cudmore in 1838 and put up for sale in 1839. He ran the business until November 1875, when he transferred the management to his nephew William Ross Sawers (c. 1839–1911) and his son-in-law Arthur Rait Malcom. They were able to use the basement of the Academy of Music, Rundle Street, (opened 1879) for cellaring. The brewery ceased operations around 1900. Primrose's remains were interred in the West Terrace Cemetery. Family John Primrose married Elizabeth Paton Reid (c. 1822 – 30 August 1867) on 10 April 1845.

It has become commonplace to distinguish between three distinct phases in 20th-century intellectual ideas: history of ideas, social history, and cultural history.Darrin M. McMahon & Samuel Moyn, 'Introduction: Interim intellectual history', in 'Rethinking modern European intellectual history', 1914, p5 These concern, respectively, the investigation of independent unit ideas, the social conditions of knowledge production, and the cultural- literary technologies and practices by which intellectual authority arises. The transition towards a quantitative social history took place during the 1960s as an attempt to broaden intellectual history, “which had lost itself in flights of idealist abstraction, underestimated the importance of material factors in shaping the human past, and ignored the plight of ordinary people.”Darrin M. McMahon & Samuel Moyn, 'Introduction: Interim intellectual history', in 'Rethinking modern European intellectual history', 1914 A second transition took place in 1980s when social history was criticized for a lack of political self-reflexivity.LaCapra, D. (1982) 'Rethinking intellectual history and reading texts', in 'Modern European intellectual history: Reappraisals and new perspectives' p79 Formation of the discipline in Sweden The Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 sparked a renewed need to define Sweden as a cultural and political entity. The rapid expansion of the Swedish Academy of Sciences offered the institutional space wherein this need could be further cultivated: nationalist narratives of Swedish scientific personas were produced on an extensive scale. This genre provided in Sweden the first production of a history of science. Two apt examples of this practice are Eneström’s Bibliotheca mathematica (1984 – 1914) and Linnésällskapets Årsskrift (1918).Frängsmyr, T. (1984), 'History of Science in Sweden. The Growth of a Discipline', 1932-1982 p12-18 After the events of the first world war, the supposed progressive direction of science was discredited, and its historical study lost interest. It was not until the 1930s that the interest for a new history of science increased in Sweden. Important figures within this revival were Eneström, Arrhenius, von Hofsten, Nordenskiöld, Oseen, and, most famously, Johan Nordström. In 1932 Nordström was appointed the first chair of History of Ideas (Idé- och lärdomshistoria) in Uppsala. Influenced by figures ranging as widely as Dilthey, Burckhardt, Comte, Buckle, Tannery, and Sarton, Nordström argued for a new social historical understanding of the history of science. History of science was considered at the base of history of ideas, Nordström writes:Frängsmyr, T. (1984), p11-18 […] history of science […] should set out to depict scientific life in its totality and in its context, to focus on the essential features of progress, the basic opinions, the emergent new ideas, the great revolutionizing discoveries, and seek to establish their importance as factors shaping the cultural process.Frängsmyr, T. (1984), p32 In 1934, Nordström founded the Swedish History of Science Association and its annual journal Lychnos, in which he was involved as editor.Frängsmyr, T. (1984), p34 He continued to hold his Chair in Uppsala until 1957. Nordström school What later became known as the Nordström school in Sweden was marked less by strict methodology than by a general sensitivity to social historical circumstances of scientific knowledge production. His students, most notably Sten Lindroth and Henrik Sandblad, worked towards a further dissemination and cultivation of the field. The former succeeded to Nordström in Uppsala in 1957, whilst the latter went on to found a Chair in the History of Ideas at the University of Gothenburg. In 1966, Rolf Lindborg founded a Chair of History of Ideas in Lund. Four years later, another chair was founded in Umeå by Gunnar Eriksson, and, lastly, in 1978, Nils Runeby founded a similar chair in Stockholm.Frängsmyr, T. (1984) Among these different departments, two general shared perspectives stand out.Frängsmyr, T. (1984), p52 First, their investigations go beyond the history of science and extend into history of humanities, religion, and a wider History of ideas. Secondly, most of the historians involved have no formal background in the natural sciences, and favour an externalist, social-contextual approach to knowledge production. Currents trends of history of science and ideas During the ‘70s and ‘80s, several Swedish History of Science and Ideas scholars were public intellectuals and engaged in the public debate, most notably Sten Lindroth, Tore Frängsmyr, Henrik Sandblad, Sven-Eric Liedman, Karin Johannisson and Ronny Ambjörnsson. At present, a number of subfields have become particularly prevalent within the history of ideas in Sweden. Most notably, media history, Cultural history, History of medicine, History of science, history of concepts, and History of theology have received increased attention. Today, history of science and ideas is practiced in Sweden at most of the universities with several hundred active scholars. The journal Lychnos continues to be an important place for intellectual exchange within the subject in Sweden.

This assessment is the most frequently used among research publications related to pelvic organ prolapse. When assessed using the POP-Q, the prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse is estimated to be up to 50% while diagnosis by symptoms has a prevalence of 3–6%. Some advocate that the system of assessment be modified. The POP-Q was developed in 1996; it quantifies the descent of pelvic organs into the vagina. The POP-Q provides reliable description of the support of the anterior, posterior and apical vaginal wall. It uses objective and precise distance measurements to the reference point, the hymen. Cystocele and prolapse of the vagina from other causes is staged using POP-Q criteria and can range from good support (no descent into the vagina) reported as a POP-Q stage 0 or I to a POP-Q score of IV, which includes prolapse beyond the hymen. It also used to quantify the movement of other structures into the vaginal lumen and their descent.  Stages  POP-Q points {  border=\\"1\\" + Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POP-Q) ! Stage !! Description -  0  No prolapse anterior and posterior points are all −3 cm, and C or D is between −TVL and −(TVL−2) cm. -  1  The criteria for stage 0 are not met, and the most distal prolapse is more than 1 cm above the level of the hymen (less than −1 cm). -  2  The most distal prolapse is between 1 cm above and 1 cm below the hymen (at least one point is −1, 0, or +1). -  3  The most distal prolapse is more than 1 cm below the hymen but no further than 2 cm less than TVL. -  4  Represents complete procidentia or vault eversion; the most distal prolapse protrudes to at least (TVL−2) cm. } The POP-Q assessment tool measures nine points in the vagina. The hymen is the reference point to which the other points are compared. The prolapsed organs are measured in centimeters to the hymen. The measurements are taken when the Valsalva maneuver is performed while The woman is in the dorsal lithotomy position. The anatomical landmarks used are anterior vaginal wall, cervix, hymen, perineal body, total vaginal length, posterior vaginal wall and posterior fornix. A three-by-three centimeter grid is used to record the proximal and distal numbers. The information on the grid is translated to the appropriate stage of prolapse. This system of assessing pelvic organ prolapse is used widely in China and the US.  Other assessments  Other assessment tools are abailable to determine the impact of pelvic floor prolapse. These are Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ), The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the shorter forms PFIQ-7 and PFDI-20. The evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse includes other diagnostic tests in addition to the POP-Q. These can be: * voiding cystometry * ultrasound * defecating proctography * anal manometry * electromyography * MRI In the US, greater than 200,000 surgeries are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse. Examples of pelvic organ prolapse are cystocele, rectocele, urethrocele, enterocele and sigmoidocele. Cystocele is the most common.  History  The Porges or Severity prolapse assessment system was proposed in 1963. In 1972, the Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring System was developed and is the second most used system. In 1980, the Beecham system was developed. The POP was developed in 1996.

It is one of his best known poems, partially because of the tonal contrast between the content of the poem and its final line. History The poem was first published in The Paris Review. It was later featured in a short story by Ann Beattie also published in The Paris Review. The poem was included in Wright's collection This Branch Will Not Break. Content The poem is a description of a pastoral scene from the perspective of a person in a hammock. Final line Much of the critical attention focused on the poem has concerned the last line. Dan Piepenbring, writing for The Paris Review, summarized the criticism in a 2010 article: > Since [the poem's publication], that last line has inspired reams of > analysis and debate—is it a lament? Is it a joke, a kind of boast? Did > Wright intend to undercut or to bolster his pastoral scene with it? Could it > be a winking response to Rilke, whose “Archaic Torso of Apollo” concludes > with the imperative “You must change your life”? Thom Gunn, in 1964, dismissed the line as \\"...certainly meaningless. The more one searches for an explicit meaning in it, the vaguer it becomes. Other general statements of different import could well be substituted for it and the poem would neither gain nor lose strength.\\" Robert Bly, a friend of Wright, wrote in defense of the line a year later, and criticized Gunn for being unable to relate to the emotion expressed by the line. David Mitchell has said that the line is a happy one, writing: \\"...I hear him exhale it with a wry laugh\\". The line is discussed in Ann Beattie's short story \\"Yancey\\". Influences Wright acknowledged that he was influenced by Chinese poetry in writing \\"Lying in a Hammock...\\" in an interview with Dave Smith. This influence has been discussed by academics including Sven Birkerts. Reception The poem has been widely anthologized. It is one of David Mitchell's favorite pieces of writing.

It is located in Benban (Aswan Governorate) in the western desert, approximately 650 km south of Cairo and 40 km northwest of Aswan. Benban is currently the 4th largest solar power plant in the world. Overview Benban Solar Park located on an area of which is subdivided into 41 separate plots arranged in 4 rows with each plot range in size from to . Each plot will be available to different companies to develop 41 plants. The 41 plants in the Benban solar park will be connected to the high voltage network through four new substations, which will be constructed on the site by the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC). These substations will in turn connect to an existing 220 kV line, which passes near the Benban Site at a distance of approximately 12 km. At a later stage EETC may also construct an additional connection to the neighbouring 500 kV line. According to measurements reported in the environmental & social assessment report the solar site resource is approximately 2,300 kWh/(m2-yr). Assuming a peak insolation of 1000 W/m2 this translates to a potential plant capacity factor of approximately 26%, i.e. the average capacity will be 26% of the nameplate capacity. If the planned capacity of 1,8 GW is utilized the potential annual energy production will be slightly more than 4 TWh/yr. The Benban Solar Park is a part of Egypt’s Nubian Suns Feed-in Tariff program, which is a major initiative to influence private sector capital and expertise, in order to support the goal of generating 20% electricity from renewable resources by 2022. The solar park is so large that it is visible from space.Egypt’s Massive 1.8-Gigawatt Benban Solar Park Nears Completion, ieee.org, visited on 19 September 2019 Commissioning status On 13 March 2018 the first 50 MWp section of the plant called \\"Infinity 50\\" was started and connected to the grid. Assuming a plant capacity factor of 26% this corresponds to an annual production of 114 GWh or 0.11 TWh. The total electricity consumption in Egypt (2015) was 182 TWh Finance On 13 March, ib vogt and Infinity Solar inaugurated the first part of the complex in the presence of the Egyptian Energy Minister, Prof. Dr. Mohamed Shaker Almraqbi. With an output of 64.1 MWp, it is also the country's first large-scale photovoltaic power plant. The project obtained financing from Bayerische Landesbank (BLB) for 85% of the debt, with the remaining 15% coming from (AAIB). The German government has provided an Euler Hermes export credit guarantee (ECG), covering the BLB loan. As part of the German foreign trade promotion programme, it thus supports Egypt's goal of meeting more than a third of its energy requirements by 2035 through renewable energies. At the end of January, ib vogt commenced construction of a portfolio of three additional solar power plants with a total capacity of 166.5 MWp in Benban, Aswan Governorate, Egypt. The project partners – an international conglomerate consisting of ib vogt, Infinity Solar, Phoenix Energy and BPE Partners – achieved financial close at the end of October. Debt financing amounting to USD 146 Million was secured for these projects. For the “BSEP 50” and “MMID 30” installations financing has been provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Dutch Development Bank (FMO) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the CDC Group provided the financing for the “Phoenix 50” project. The International Finance Corporation led a consortium of Africa Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Arab Bank of Bahrain, CDC Group, Europe Arab Bank, Green for Growth Fund, FinnFund, ICBC, and OeEB of Austria by pledging US$653 million to finance building and operating 13 plants by six groups of private power companies, including, TAQA Arabia, Shapoorji Energy, a subsidiary of Shapoorji Pallonji Group and Acciona Energy. The 13 solar power plants, which are expected to have a peak power of 752 MW, will cost US$823 million in total. Assuming a capacity factor of 26% this corresponds to an annual production of 1,75 TWh/yr. Also the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, will provide US$210 million in political risk insurance to 12 projects within Benban.

Founded in 2004, Bargain Hunt is headquartered in La Vergne, Tennessee with retail locations in Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas. History Essex Technology Group - Bargain Hunt's parent company was founded in the year 2000 in Nashville by Robert Echols and Phil Pfeffer. They started off the company as a wholesaler of closeout goods. The company bought overstock and excess inventory goods from big box retailers and sold them. Initially, the focus was on electronics and computers. The first store was opened in 2004 in Nashville and was known as Essex Bargain Hunt. The company also began an online store selling directly to retail customers from its original Nashville location. The strategy was to sell items that were too big or expensive to sell online. After a successful run, Essex launched the Bargain Hunt superstores - using locations abandoned by stores such as Staples and Circuit City. The name was later changed to Bargain Hunt. Expansion Bargain Hunt opened its first store in Nashville in the year 2004 and went on to expand in Southern and Midwest United States. The chain operates more than 80 stores in 10 states as of 2017. In 2015, Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired a majority stake in the retail chain. Retail Format Bargain Hunt stores are typically around 20,000 - 25,000 sq ft. in size and sell products such as electronics, movies and music, furniture, home improvement, clothing, footwear, jewelry, toys, health and beauty, pet supplies, sporting goods and fitness. Bargain Hunt in Griffin, Georgia Sales Strategy The stores sells name brands at a discount of 30% to 70% on regular prices and plays in the extreme value retail space. The store also utilizes a discounting program that drops the prices on items by specific percentages depending on the time they have been on shelves.

She worked to get Maryland's death penalty law repealed in 2013, and founded and co- organizes quarterly 72-hour \\"Ceasefire\\" weekends. Baltimore Ceasefire weekends began in 2017, in the hope of reducing violence. Erricka was named 2017's Marylander of the Year by the Baltimore Sun.  Early life  Bridgeford was born on October 9, 1972, the oldest of four children. She grew up in Normount Court, a housing project in West Baltimore. Her family was close-knit, and her parents, she said in an interview, were like \\"the Huxtables of the ghetto,\\" serving as surrogate parents to other young people in the neighborhood. The area was poor but not plagued with violence until the 1980s and 90s. Since then she has lost a brother, a stepson, two cousins (who were brothers), and several friends to gun violence. As a result of Amniotic Band Syndrome, Bridgeford was born without a right hand, and with four fingers on her left hand.  Career  Bridgeford began her career working for an organization devoted to infant wellness. In 2001 she trained as a volunteer at the Baltimore Community Mediation Center; two months later she was hired, and in 2002 she became their director of training. In 2005, Erricka became Director of Training at Community Mediation Maryland where she provided training to the 18 community mediation centers in Maryland, as well as to state agencies and organizations. In 2020, she was named Executive Director at Baltimore Community Mediation Center. On February 3, 2018, she made a guest appearance on the online children's web series, Danny Joe's Tree House.  Activism  Bridgeford has been involved in community activism since the late 1990s. The death of her brother David in 2007 inspired her to focus on ending violence.  Death penalty repeal  Bridgeford began advocating for repeal of the death penalty in Maryland in 2009. Along with several other survivors of homicide victims, she testified before the Maryland legislature, spoke repeatedly to the press, and shared her personal story at rallies and other events. She argued that justice could not be gained through revenge, and that the death penalty was a form of revenge. \\"It's not justice to me to have another dead body in place of my brother's dead body,\\" she said in an interview. Bridgeford believed the death penalty only brought more pain and failed to honor the victims; she suggested to a CBS reporter that the money Maryland saved by repealing the death penalty could be used to provide services to the victims' families. Senator Bobby Zirkin later cited the testimony of homicide survivors such as Bridgeford as a major factor in his decision to support the repeal. The death penalty was repealed in Maryland in 2013.  Support for survivors of homicide victims  Bridgeford worked with a coalition of murder victims' family members and organizations to support Maryland House Bill 0355 (Programs for Survivors of Homicide Victims). The bill was designed to identify survivors of homicide victims as a group of victims, and to ensure yearly funding. The bill passed and was approved by the governor on April 14, 2015. Maryland became the second state in the United States to provide specific funds and resources to murder victims' family members. The same year, Senator Lisa Gladden introduced Senate Bill 0512, which called for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to include a survivor of homicide. At the hearing, Gladden said that she was inspired by Bridgeford's advocacy for homicide survivors, and believed that someone who had lost a loved one to homicide should be included on the Board that makes decisions about providing resources to victims' families. The bill was signed into law on April 14, 2014.  Baltimore Ceasefire 365  The idea for a ceasefire weekend was first suggested by hip-hop artist Ogun, who was working with Bridgeford on a rally for the anti-violence group 300 Men March. In 2017, with Baltimore's murder rate climbing, Bridgeford revisited the idea with Ogun and several other activists and began planning. The idea was to see if the community could go 72 hours without a shooting, stabbing, or any other kind of violence; their motto was \\"Nobody kill anybody.\\" In addition, the effort rallied citizens to create and attend life-affirming events for 72 hours, while accepting the Baltimore Peace Challenge. The first Ceasefire took place the first weekend in August, and drew thousands of residents to special community events and activities. The second Ceasefire weekend, held in November, was even larger. Events included basketball tournaments, a yoga class, art exhibits, a sip-and-paint, a peace walk, and a campout. During the November 2017 ceasefire weekend, Tony Mason was killed, and then, the weekend continued with 48 hours of zero shootings. During the third ceasefire weekend in February 2018, there were zero homicides. This was the first weekend in 2018 in which no Baltimore residents were killed. The February 2018 ceasefire also began a stretch of 11.5 days without murder in Baltimore. This was the first time the city had experienced this since March 2014. Bridgeford gave credit to everyone in the city who had been tirelessly doing good work for years. When murders occurred during the first two Baltimore Ceasefire weekends, residents were called to show up at the murder locations to pour light and love into the space and into the traumatized community. This began a new campaign, \\"Don't Be Numb\\", which encourages Baltimoreans to notice when people are killed, and to remember that each life lost is a loss for all of Baltimore. This also gave birth to Sacred Space Rituals, in which residents go to murder locations to make them sacred ground. Bridgeford's efforts started a grassroots movement and \\"awakened a sense that the cycle of killing can be broken and that the power to do it lies in our own hands.\\" She was named Marylander of the Year \\"for bringing hope to Baltimore in some of its bleakest hours.\\" In 2020, research published by the American Journal for Public Health showed that there was an estimated 52% reduction in gun violence during ceasefire days and no evidence of a postponement effect on either the next 3 days or the next 3-day weekend following each ceasefire weekend.

It has a single, thin tubular leaf and up to fifteen small, greenish-brown to brown flowers well-spaced along a thin flowering stem. It is only known from a small area around Stawell. Description Prasophyllum subbisectum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf long and wide. Between seven and fifteen flowers are well-spaced along a flowering stem long which reaches to a height of . The flowers are greenish-brown to brown and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, about wide and curves downward. The lateral sepals are long, about wide and curve backwards. The petals are long, about wide and pointed. The labellum is greenish or pinkish, egg-shaped, about long and wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle. There is a shiny green or brown, deeply channelled callus along the centre of the labellum, extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in October and November. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum subbisectum was first formally described in 1936 by William Henry Nicholls and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist from a specimen collected near Pomonal. The specific epithet (subbisectum) is derived from the Latin word sectus meaning \\"cut\\", with the prefixes sub- meaning \\"somewhat\\" and bi- meaning \\"two\\" or \\"double\\". Distribution and habitat The Pomonal leek orchid mostly grows in heathy woodland near Stawell. Conservation In 2010, P. subbisectum was recorded in four populations with a total of about 130 plants. It is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to its survival are grazing by rabbits and kangaroos, habitat disturbance and inappropriate fire regimes.

The inaccessibility, strength, beauty and fragility of the fairy-tale figure Snow White became her trademark. Tilley would regularly refer to this in her later visual work. Tilley studied at Sint Lucas in Brussels and learned the technique of painting there. Tilley was a former student of the Antwerp Fashion Academy. She graduated there cum laude with the theme for her final collection Mahler and Venice . Tilley was known for her romantic to fairytale clothing. In 1990 she designed a jewelry collection. In 1993 she signed the costumes for the film Antoine. Her creations are midway between fashion and art. She dressed among others Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Naomi Campbell, Melanie Griffith and Halle Berry. In the meantime she became an established name, witness her retrospective exhibition at the Gaasbeek Castle in the autumn of 2005. In 2007 Tilley kept on her living and working area in Asbeek (Asse) an exhibition and sale of a large part of her prototypes and paintings.

Fossils of Vernonopterus have been discovered in deposits of the Carboniferous period in Scotland. The name of the genus derives from the location where the only known fossil has been discovered, Mount Vernon near Airdrie in Lanarkshire, Scotland. A single species of Vernonopterus is recognized, V. minutisculptus, based on fragmentary fossilized tergites, segments on the upper side of the abdomen. The species name minutisculptus refers to the ornamentation of scales that covers the entirety of the preserved parts of the eurypterid. Although little can confidently be said about the appearance of Vernonopterus, it is likely to have been similar to its relatives within the hibbertopterid family, Hibbertopterus and Campylocephalus. The hibbertopterids were large eurypterids with broad heads and bodies and appendages developed for sweep-feeding, a technique involving blade-like adaptations to search for food in the substrate of its living environment. Compared to both Hibbertopterus and Campylocephalus, Vernonopterus would have been small, reaching lengths of about 50 centimetres (19.7 inches).  Description  The estimated size of V. minutisculptus compared to a human Classified as a member of the hibbertopterid family of eurypterids, Vernonopterus is assumed to have been overall similar to the other members of the family. The scant fossil remains attributed to the eurypterid suggests that it was a large and broad- bodied animal that probably measured around 50 centimetres (19.7 inches) in length.Lamsdell, James C.; Braddy, Simon J. (2009). \\"Cope's Rule and Romer's theory: patterns of diversity and gigantism in eurypterids and Palaeozoic vertebrates\\". Biology Letters: rsbl20090700. doi:10.1098/rsbl.2009.0700. ISSN 1744-9561. PMID 19828493. Supplementary information Although limited in number by the fragmentary nature of the fossil remains, some distinguishing features of Vernonopterus have been established. In particular, the more posterior (further towards the back) tergites (segments on the upper side of the abdomen) tend to become more and more trilobate (shaped so that they almost have three distinct lobes), in the middle of the tergites the ornamentation (something typical of eurypterid exoskeletons) form a series of tracts that almost morph into three ridges. Due to the tergites being the only known parts of Vernonopterus, next to nothing can be said about other parts of its body such as the head and the appendages (limbs). They are likely to have resembled those of its relatives, where the carapace (exoskeleton covering the head) was large and broad (similar to the rest of the body) with appendages developed to sweep-feeding, a technique involving blade-like adaptations to search for food in the substrate of its living environment. The ventral plates of Vernonopterus were granulated finely (had a rough surface) with small scales being present near the posterior borders of the plates. In the middle of the tergites, the ornamentation is more pronounced than at their borders, taking the form of semi-lunar (almost moon-shaped) scales. Further back on the eurypterids' body, these scales change into larger scales grouped into large longitudinal ridges. On the borders of the later tergites, these large scales protrude and form structures similar to crenulations. The longitudinal ridges divide the tergites of Vernonopterus into axial (spine) and pleural (ribs) parts, which differentiates it from all other hibbertopterids.Hughes, Emily (2019). Discerning the Diets of Sweep-Feeding Eurypterids Through Analyses of Mesh-Modified Appendage Armature. West Virginia University Graduate Theses, Dissertations, and Problem Reports.  History of research  The holotype and only known specimen of Vernonopterus was discovered by local fossil hunter Robert Dunlop in coal measures at Mount Vernon near Airdrie in Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1884. The fossil, at the present stored at the Royal Scottish Museum with the specimen number 1957.1.4992, consists of a series of fragmentary tergites. It wasn't described scientifically until 1905, when British geologist Ben Peach descriped the specimen and assigned it to a new species of the genus Glyptoscorpius (a name today recognized as synonymous with Adelophthalmus) as G. minutisculptus. Peach's description has been criticized by later researchers as inadequate and in some ways misleading. Peach considered the fossil's horizon to prove that Glyptoscorpius was a land animal since it was preserved alongside plant fossils. The specific name minutisculptus refers to the ornementation that covers the entirety of the preserved portions of the animal. The specimen was given a more complete description by British geologist Charles D. Waterston in 1957, who instead referred it to the genus Eurypterus as E. minutisculptus. By this time it had been encased in a collar of \\"fibrenyle\\" packaging (a type of plastic) to give strength to and preserve the very fragile fossil. Features revealed during Waterston's second examination of the fossil in 1968 made it clear that the eurypterid was not congeneric with known species of Eurypterus, nor part of the eurypterine suborder (eurypterids that possessed swimming paddles) at all. Instead, Waterston inferred that E. minutisculptus had very clearly been a broad-bodied and large eurypterid, although any detailed statements about the prosoma (head), appendages and the telson (the final body segment, often taking the shape of a tail spike) could not be made as those portions of the body were unknown. Waterston created a new genus to contain the species, Vernonopterus, with the name deriving from the location where the fossil had been found, Mount Vernon. Waterston referred the new genus to the family \\"Woodwardopteridae\\" (now referred to as the Mycteroptidae), but no particular reasoning was given. Vernonopterus was assigned to Hibbertopterus by Cuban paleontolgost Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering in 1966 as H. minutisculptus, but he noted that this classification was not certain. Similarities between the Vernonopterus specimen and specimens referred to Dunsopterus (today recognized as a junior synonym of Hibbertopterus) were noted by Waterston and Norwegian paleontologist Leif Størmer in 1968. Modern researchers classify the genus within the Hibbertopteridae instead, sometimes noting that its position is somewhat uncertain due to its fragmentary nature.  Classification  Reconstruction of the related Hibbertopterus, a more completely known hibbertopterid eurypterid. Vernonopterus is classified as part of the family Hibbertopteridae, a family of eurypterids within the superfamily Mycteropoidea, alongside the genera Hibbertopterus and Campylocephalus. The genus contains one species; V. minutisculptus from the Carboniferous of Lanarkshire, Scotland.Dunlop, J. A., Penney, D. & Jekel, D. 2015. A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives. In World Spider Catalog. Natural History Museum Bern, online at http://wsc.nmbe.ch, version 16.0 http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/resources/fossils/Fossils16.0.pdf (PDF). The hibbertopterids are united as a group by being large mycteropoids with broad prosomas, a hastate (e.g. shaped like a gladius, a Roman sword) telson with paired keels on the ventral side, ornamentation consisting of scales or other similar structures on the exoskeleton, the fourth pair of appendages possessing spines, the more posterior tergites of the abdomen possessing tongue-shaped scales near their edges and there being lobes positioned posterolaterally (posteriorly on both sides) on the prosoma. The features of Campylocephalus and Vernonopterus makes it clear that both genera represent hibbertopterid eurypterids, but the incomplete nature of all fossil specimens referred to them make any further study of the precise phylogenetic relationships within the Hibbertopteridae difficult. Both genera could even represent synonyms of Hibbertopterus itself, though the highly incomplete nature of their remains again makes that hypothesis impossible to confirm. By comparing the ornamentation of various hibbertopterids in 2019, American geologist Emily Hughes could conclude that several genera were actually congeneric, subsuming some previously recognized hibbertopterids (such as Cyrtoctenus) into Hibbertopterus. She noted that the distinct ornamentation of Vernonopterus supported it as a distinct genus.  Paleoecology  Vernonopterus lived during the Westphalian age in modern-day Lanarkshire, Scotland. Though they probably would not have been prey items to Vernonopterus, a diverse contemporary fauna of actinopterygian fish are known from Lanarkshire as well, including species such as Rhadinichthys ornatocephalum, R. glabrolepis, R. plumosum, Pseudogonatodus aurulentum and Lanarkichthys gardineri. Out of this actinopterygian diversity, there are many haplolepid fishes, a small and basal group, known, including Blairolepis wallacei, Parahaplolepis poppaea, P. elenae, P. alexandrae, Braccohaplolepis fenestratum, Andrewsolepis lochlani, Protohaplolepis isabellae, P. limnades, P. traquairi, Pyritocephalus youngii and Millerolepis eleionomae. Vernonopterus and these fish would have lived in a brackish fresh water environment. Hibbertopterids such as Vernonopterus were sweep-feeders, having modified spines on their forward-facing prosomal appendages that allowed them to rake through the substrate of their living environments. Though sweep- feeding was used as a strategy by many genera within the Stylonurina, it was most developed within the hibbertopterids, which possessed blades on the second, third and fourth pair of appendages. Some species of the closely related Hibbertopterus had specialized comb-like rachis (shafts) that were able to entrap small prey and other organic food particles. Though they would have been slow owing to their massive size and robust form, studies on Hibbertopterus footprints discovered in Scotland have demonstrated that hibbertopterids would have been able to walk on land for at least short periods of time. The tracks discovered indicate that they would have utilized a lumbering, jerking and dragging movement and that the keeled belly and the telson left a central groove behind. Some studies suggest that eurypterids possessed a dual respiratory system (capable of breathing in both air and underwater), which would have allowed for this kind of occasional terrestrial movement.

Starry currently operates within Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Denver, and Washington, DC. Background and availability Starry, Inc. was publicly announced in January 2016 by Chaitanya \\"Chet\\" Kanojia, who had previously founded Aereo. , it was providing commercial service to a limited number of apartment buildings in the Boston area for $50/month per apartment, promising 200Mbit/s upload and download speeds. , Starry was based in Boston, had about 100 employees, and had raised $63 million of funding. Kanojia claims that Starry's capital cost will be only $25 per home, as compared to $2,500 for cable. Starry announced on July 1st, 2019 that through an FCC spectrum auction, they acquired 104 licenses for 24 GHz millimeter-wave spectrum to cover 51 markets in 25 states. Starry's system operates on the 38.2 GHz and 38.6 GHz bands, connecting its base stations (\\"Starry Beam\\") to receivers on individual buildings (\\"Starry Points\\"). Each base station covers a radius of 1.5 km. Signal propagation is near line-of- sight, not penetrating buildings and windows, and is degraded by foliage or rain, so Starry directs its signal using Multi-user MIMO phased array antennas, and can take advantage of reflections. The base station redistributes its signal within a building using Starry's own Wi-Fi router (\\"Starry Station\\"). Critical reception Analysts are mixed about Starry's prospects.

In 1849 she left her husband to care for her niece and nephew in Hobart after their mother died. She became their carer and returned with them to England. her brother remarried and no longer needed her as foster mother in England.

Many settlers left the area. Charles A.

Production The boat was built by Performance Sailcraft, the builder of the Laser dinghy, in Canada from 1984 until 1990, but it is now out of production. Production-level manufacturing was started in March 1984 and the first customer deliveries were made in October 1984 Early versions were hand-laid, while later ones were produced using a closed-mold process. The company specifically planned that the Laser 28 would be the sole keelboat offered and did not intend to produce a graduated line of boats, unlike other manufacturers at that time. Development The Laser 28's design started in 1978, following the success of the Laser dinghy, with the intention to produce a keelboat equivalent, for the Laser sailors who would outgrow the Laser, just need a keelboat as they aged, or for family cruising and racing. In 1980 Ian Bruce, president of Performance Sailcraft decided to take the boat design away from that company to reduce commercial pressures on the design team. He formed Bruce Yacht R&D; Inc (BYRD) and teamed with designer Bruce Farr and a group headed up by the president of the International Laser Class Association, Tim Coventry. The Laser 28 was Farr's 91st boat design. The project development team included Performance Sailcraft's Ian Bruce, Tim Coventry President of the International Laser Class Association, experienced sailor Peter Hicks, Norman Frost as plastics engineer and Piers Phipps as project financial advisor. Hans Fogh designed the sails, as he had done for the Laser dinghy. The boat project had four design goals. First, that the boat should be a strict one-design in the same vein as the Laser dinghy, with all boats produced the same with class rules that prohibited any changes to the boat, so that the competition would be between sailing skills and not the ability to pay for improvements. Second, that the design should have outstanding performance, unhampered by adherence to any rule structure, such as the International Offshore Rule, to ensure a long life as a competitive boat. Third, that the boat be a quality product, using the best of available technology. Fourth, that the boat represent a good value for the monetary outlay, \\"the intention being to produce a 28 foot yacht with a performance of a 35 foot yacht at the price of a 25 foot yacht.\\" Two prototypes were built and the first sailed in the early summer of 1981 in Falmouth, England, with the second in the water that autumn. Originally fitted with a large genoa foresail the second prototype used a 108% \\"lapper\\" jib, that proved superior in winds over and was easier to handle by short-handed crews, as well as cheaper to produce. The prototypes were tested in severe conditions, including broaching and intentional knockdowns with the spinnaker flying, in winds that left the cockpit dry and with no equipment failures. With $1,000,000 invested, to get the design from testing to production, a new firm was created by financial consultant Piers Phipps, Precis Ninety Nine Limited. The design was licensed to Performance Sailcraft to produce. Design Laser 28 The Laser 28 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with a Termanto PVC foam hull and deck. It has a fractional sloop rig and a spinnaker, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard fin keel. The prototypes were fitted with Honda four-stroke gasoline engines, coupled to a Volvo saildrive, but there was resistance to using gasoline engines in Europe, due to the fire hazard. The production boats were therefore delivered with a Bukh 8SME diesel engine of . Production sails include mainsail, a 106% \\"lapper\\" jib of , a working jib of , a #1 spinnaker of , a #2 spinnaker of and an optional genoa of . The boat has a hull speed of and a PHRF racing average handicap of 123 with a high of 117 and low of 132. Operational history The Laser 28 was not sold though the existing Performance Sailcraft company dealer network, but rather through direct representatives who owned and sailed Laser 28s and organized events for them. Robert Dunkley of Nassau, Bahamas, took delivery of his Laser 28 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and sailed directly to Nassau with a crew of three, the same day. They sailed in north winds in the Gulf Stream and encountered waves en route, but completed the voyage without incident, although the rigging required tightening at destination. Judy and Frank Button from Vancouver, British Columbia won the IYC winter series in their Laser 28, for the fourth time in a row. The company's San Francisco Bay representative, Paul Kaplan, sailed his Laser 28 single handed on its fourth outing and won first place in the class and first overall in a 38 boat fleet in the Singlehanded Sailing Society’s Three Bridge Fiasco Race. Kaplan's wife, Chris, sailed the boat with an all-female crew to third place in the Women’s Racing Association winter series.

In the War of the Two Kings in Ireland he fought for William III against the Jacobite Irish Army of James II. During the campaign he was Chief Engineer with charge of the Royal Artillery. Background He was an Irish Protestant raised partly on his father's estates in County Wexford. His father Solomon Richards had served in the New Model Army under Oliver Cromwell. Campaigns In 1689 he was sent to Londonderry, which was under siege at the time to study the feasibility of relieving the city by sea. In 1689 he oversaw the artillery bombardment during the Siege of Carrickfergus, where he was wounded three times. He was apparently present at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. At the second, decisive Siege of Limerick the next year his action was decisive in the taking of Castle Connell, north-east of Limerick. In 1692, following the Treaty of Limerick, which ended the Irish War, much of his force was redeployed to Flanders where William was leading an Allied Army against the French. His sons Jacob and Michael both oversaw the Artillery during the battles of Steenkirk and Landen and went some way to establishing the traditions of the Royal Artillery. Family He had three sons, all of whom pursued military careers. The eldest, also called Jacob, served as part of the Tangier Garrison and later with William of Orange in Flanders. He died in 1701. The second son John Richards converted to Catholicism. This led him to serve abroad in the Austrian Army.

History  The Fighting Cocks public house in November 2005 seen from the site of the level crossing. The station was located on the immediately to the left of the road.When the Stockton & Darlington Railway first opened on 10 October 1825, there were no official stations, as passenger trains were provided by independent coach operators who purchased a licence from the railway company to enable them to operate on the line. Tickets were sold by local publicans, and so it has been claimed that the Fighting Cocks public house, a coaching inn near where the railway crossed Rykeneild Street, could be the oldest station booking office in the world. It was not until the success of passenger services on the Liverpool & Manchester Railway persuaded the S&DR; to purchase the coach operators that in December 1833 it began to operate its own locomotive-hauled passenger service. In 1829, the Dinsdale Spa Hotel was opened close to the village of Low Dinsdale, which led to an increase in travel to the village using the railway. As a result, a permanent station was opened during the 1830s (appearing in timetables by 1838), on the east side of the level crossing, to cater for this traffic. It was originally called 'Middleton and Dinsdale' but was renamed 'Fighting Cocks' in 1866. In 1863 the S&DR; was amalgamated into the North Eastern Railway (NER), who on 1 July 1887 opened a new line from south of Darlington Bank Top station to Oak Tree Junction, east of Fighting Cocks station, to enable passenger services on the former S&DR; route to serve Bank Top station. However the opening of this new route meant that Fighting Cocks was bypassed, and so a new station was provided at to replace it. Over the course of its life as a passenger station, approximately 30,000 passenger tickets were sold to Fighting Cocks. From this point on Fighting Cocks was only served by goods trains until it was closed completely as an economy measure in 1964. The line through the station remained as a through line until it was severed at the western end on 21 May 1967, though it was partially retained as a short branch line from Oak Tree Junction until the 1970s. A public footpath now runs along the alignment of the railway through the site of the station.

In Prehispanic Mexico, it is present in pyramids, sanctuaries, esplanades and communal objects; examples of this are the Olmec, Mayan, Teotihuacan, Tarascan, Mixtec and Aztec sculptures. Many of these sculptures have been cataloged as masterpieces and stand out for their monumentality, since many of them are huge and exposed to be seen publicly.  Sculpture in 16th and 17th centuries  País de volcanes Personaje con penacho. Church of Santa María Tonantzintla, Puebla, México. Sculpture after the conquest is divided into two areas: decorative and statuary. Both were made in stone or wood. Plateresque art was essentially sculptural and in the Colony it produced important altarpieces. In the cathedral of Mexico, work Claudio Arciniega and Juan Miguel Agüero. It will become the paradigm of colonial architecture. Francisco Becerra will raise the cathedral of Puebla. Francisco Antonio Guerrero y Torres: Chapel of the Pocito, in the Villa de Guadalupe. In Puebla, a very active baroque school appears. Sanctuaries of Ocotlán in Tlaxcala, and of San Francisco de Acatepec, two magnificent examples of the New Spanish Baroque. In all the colonial cities, fine finishes in the ornamentation and the facades of the churches can be appreciated. Oaxaca and its numerous temples like Soledad and Santo Domingo show the beauty and magnificence of it.  Sculpture in 18th century  The academies created in Europe from the s17th century were founded on the rational abandoning the purely religious vision that had dominated the previous centuries. In New Spain, this philosophy sparked a reaction against the baroque. Thus, altarpieces that were essentially sculptural were considered overloaded and replaced by architectural manifestations. The central figure of this era in New Spain is the Spaniard Manuel Tolsá.  Sculpture in 19th century  Romanticism tended to break the norms and strict models of classicism, as it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. Religious sculpture was reduced to sporadic imagery, while secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature. Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the insurgency movement and scenes and characters of pre-Cortesian history, and portraits of the old aristocracy, of the rising bourgeoisie and champions of the pre revolution. The transcendent sphere consisted in introducing civil reasons, the first national types and glimpses of a current of self-expression.  Sculpture in 20th century  Differentiated by its objectives and the emphasis of its theme, three currents emerged: an indigenist, archaic and folkloric; another, neoclassical, civic and historical; and a third, socialist, with ideological propaganda. During the 20th century, great exponents of Mexican sculpture are Rómulo Rozo, Enrique Gottdiener Soto, Juan Soriano, José Luis Cuevas, Sebastián and Mathias Goeritz.

History BambooHR was founded in 2008 by Ben Peterson and Ryan Sanders. Based in Lindon, Utah, the company has a dancing panda mascot. BambooHR had 470 employees in November 2019. In 2019, BambooHR served 11,000 clients that were based in 100 countries. BambooHR customers in 2017 included Shopify, Foursquare, and Reddit. BambooHR started a \\"paid paid vacation\\" policy in 2015. Employees who have worked at BambooHR for at least six months are eligible for $2,000 in reimbursements for vacation expenses like airline tickets, hotel rooms, and other tourist activities. Joe Fryer profiled BambooHR's vacation policy on the Today show on September 16, 2016. In October 2019, BambooHR appointed Brad Rencher, who had previously been a marketing executive at Adobe Inc., to replace Ben Peterson as the company's CEO. Peterson became a co-chairman on the board of directors with fellow co-founder Ryan Sanders. Software BambooHR provides companies a human capital management software as a service. The service has a dashboard homepage with different sections for employee information, vacation time record keeping, and reports. The dashboard also contains an employee's image, contact details, and vacation time remaining. It has areas that show scheduled lessons and business communications. Users can see their coworkers' birthdays and scheduled time off. BambooHR's software includes an applicant tracking system. The system has a catalogue of job opportunities and data about each opportunity including the hiring manager, how many people have applied, and how long it has been posted. BambooHR's integration allows job openings to be posted at the same time to the company's jobs page and to career sites like Glassdoor and Indeed. BambooHR allows companies to record employee benefits. It includes reports that help employees fill out Affordable Care Act compliance forms. In 2017, Juan Martinez and Rob Marvin wrote in PC Magazine that BambooHR's benefits administration functionalities are inferior to Zenefits'. They concluded that although the software is \\"easy to get up and running\\", it is more expensive than a large number of its competitors and its website is \\"pretty but lacks functionality\\". It also has a performance review feature. It provides an open API to allow combination with other HR software services. In 2017, it started BambooHR Marketplace to allow software developers to market HR apps they have integrated with BambooHR.

In 1910 Nielsen built the first biplane in Alameda, commissioned by Adrian J Merle. An early adopter of automobile technology, he also believed in the potential represented by aviation. Nielsen was also a firefighter who innovated several firefighting devices, and was the first engineer at the Alameda Electric Light Plant. As a prominent member of the Alameda community his activities were frequently covered in local newspapers, often under the misspelling \\"Nielson.\\" Early life Hans Peter Nielsen was born in Denmark in 1855. He married his wife Hansine Christine (18531925) in 1883, and the following year he traveled to the United States for the first time. Nielsen returned to Denmark in 1886. He, Hansine, and their children Augusta and Christian sailed to San Francisco in 1887 and settled in Alameda. The ship manifest lists Nielsen's occupation as Watchmaker. Nielsen became a naturalized citizen on July 27, 1892.California State Library, California History Section; Great Registers 1866-1898; Collection Number: 4 - 2A; CSL Roll Number: 4; FHL Roll Number: 976450 He and Hansine had two more children in California: Ella and Adolph. As of the 1920 Census Hansine reported having given birth to 8 children, but only Augusta, Ella, and Adolph still lived. Career Firefighter Nielsen joined the Alameda Fire Department in 1890 as the \\"first paid Alameda city fireman.\\" He served as engineer of the Encinal Steamer No. 1, a horse-drawn engine with a steam pumper. Nielsen's idiosyncratic methods made an impression on his fellow firefighters: Alameda Electric Light In 1901, Nielsen left the Fire Department to become the first engineer at the Alameda Electric Light Plant. Alameda Municipal Power is the oldest municipal electrical utility west of the Mississippi, and from 1887 until 1902 provided Alameda with electric street lights. In 1902, the Alameda Electric Light Plant sub-station also began to offer electrical power to homes and businesses.http://media.alamedamp.com/assets/pdf/theFlash/2012/flash_July2012_O.pdf Automobile repairman Nielsen repaired automobiles as proprietor of the Encinal Garage in Alameda. In 1909 Nielsen was also issued a permit for him to build a $600 machine shop building behind his home at 2254 Santa Clara Avenue. Even as Nielsen was working on flying machines in his backyard shop, his Encinal garage reportedly hired \\"a couple of men\\" to assist with the motor line during the busy spring season of 1910. In 1912, the city of Alameda awarded Nielsen a contract for construction of a tractor to pull the Fire Station No. 1 hook-and-ladder truck. The contract for $800 specified that the tractor would be equipped with pneumatic front tires and a 35-horsepower Toledo engine, and guaranteed to draw the truck at 20 miles per hour. Further, the engine had to detachable, with the ability to hitch the truck to horses within five minutes. Aeroplane builder Nielsen in his biplane, 1910 Nielsen studied the new science of aviation, including making close examination of planes flown by aviator Louis Paulhan, and had made designs for several aircraft. He did not have the funds to manufacture these designs himself. In 1910, he met businessman Adrian J Merle at an aviation meet in San Francisco. Merle had recently flown as a passenger at a Los Angeles aviation meet, and was determined to start manufacturing aircraft. On January 23, 1910, Nielsen announced to a group of automobile enthusiasts his intention to begin manufacturing aircraft. With financial backing from Adrian and Isadore Merle, Nielsen expected to start construction in weeks. In early February Nielsen announced that he was indeed ready to start construction of airplanes at once, beginning with orders for two biplanes and one monoplane. Nielsen anticipated completion of the first airplane in two months: \\"a plane for pleasure purposes that will combine speed and safety ... about thirty feet in width, and [with the] capacity of carrying two passengers.\\" Building Merle's biplane took months longer than anticipated, and by September Nielsen was in a race with another local engineer, William Gorham, to build Alameda's first working airplane. Both craft were described as a cross between Curtiss and Farman models. Gorham's plane was described as a 120-pound craft with a six-cylinder, 30 horsepower engine and a 30-foot span. Nielsen's much larger airplane had a 45 horse power six-cylinder engine, 40-foot span, a record wing area of 740 square feet, and weighed about 800 pounds. Nielsen had designed his larger, heavier airplane with the inexperienced aviator in mind: Merle tested Nielsen's aeroplane at the Stockton Airport in September 1910. The biplane was too heavy for sustained flight, only managing to remain airborne for a few hundred feet at a time. The plane was dismantled and kept in Merle's basement for decades afterwards, but never flew again. Nielsen is not reported to have completed any other aircraft. Inventions Firefighting innovations In 1892, after two years with the Alameda Fire Department, Nielsen submitted a patent for an Automatic Releasing Device \\"which can be applied to the releasing of hitched animals, such as horses in fire houses.\\" He was granted US Patent 490211 the next year. Nielsen and Alameda Fire Chiefhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/alam-kra.htm Frederick Keller Krauth, Jr. registered in 1897 for an improved Hose Nozzle. Their multi-headed design included a novel method of switching between a single stream, a double stream, and a wider spray, anticipating the modern manually adjustable fog nozzle. This design was used by the Alameda Fire Department and others. Workshop inventions , an acetylene gas generator devised by HP Nielsen. In 1898, Nielsen filed a patent for an Acetylene Gas Generator. His central drip generator, designed for use in automobiles and similar portable lamps, proposed to use calcium carbide to generate gas as well as to dehydrate the gas after production. When the carbide was spent, the mechanism would cut off the flow of water and automatically give an alarm. When was awarded in 1900, local newspapers celebrated Nielsen's patent for a \\"gas generator\\" or \\"acetylene gas meter.\\" In January 1910 the Alameda Times- Star reported that \\"H.P. , an automobile expert of this city,\\" had patented an electrical automobile starter. No such patent can be found, and it is likely that the newspaper misattributed a foreign patent by Herman Nielsen to the local inventor. Similarly, in 1912 the Times-Star announced that Nielsen had, patented a new electric welding device in partnership with Otto Beckman of Oakland, but no matching patent has been found. Caster wheel designs In the late 1920s, Nielsen patented several inventions related to caster wheels. Nielsen is listed as assignor to the Eames Company of San Francisco. This company, maker of \\"invalid chairs, steel wheels and rubber tired ball bearing wheel goods,\\" was owned by Adrian J Merle, for whom Nielsen had built a biplane in 1910. In 1927, Nielsen patented an improved caster wheel to solve the problem of tire creep and side flex under heavy load: .His wheel structure included disks clamped to either side of the wheel, and a webbed fabric structure integrated into the rubber of the tire. In the same year, Nielsen filed a patent for Wheel Structures comprising a swivel caster with ball bearings. He refiled in 1930, and was granted . The same year he filed and was issued a patent for a caster wheel brake structure, . Personal life Nielsen and his family were subject to frequent news coverage, his name frequently misspelled as \\"Nielson.\\" Besides his professional accomplishments and inventions, the local press took a keen interest in his injuries, clashes with the law, and second marriage. Injuries and mishaps In 1900, Nielsen made the local Swedish-language newspaper with a work-related injury sustained from a fall from a ladder. Nielsen and his daughter Augusta were almost killed in an automobile accident during a pleasure drive in 1904. Nielsen lost control of his vehicle on a steep road on the way to Redwood Canyon. Augusta was thrown from the vehicle but avoided injury; Nielsen landed in bushes and barbed wire, and was hurt but not severely. In November, 1907, Augusta was badly injured in an accident at work. The office where she worked as a stenographer was undergoing construction, and she was struck unconscious when a carpenter dropped a door, smashing her head into her typewriter. Nielsen made front-page news in 1905 when, driving near Sacramento, his automobile was trampled by steers being herded by cattlemen. Although Nielsen was injured and his automobile suffered serious damage, he was able to perform makeshift repairs. He drove to Oakland with a gas lamp as a headlight and a piece of lumber in place of the steering wheel. In January 1909, the Oakland Tribune reported on Nielsen's bout of food poisoning in San Francisco. \\"Medical assistance was called in on his arrival home and the prompt use of the stomach pump probably saved life.\\" Just days later, while driving an automobile owned by Dr. J.A. Riley, Nielsen reportedly struck a boy named Bert Smith riding a bicycle. The boy was unhurt. On February 8, 1910, just days after announcing his plan to build airships, Nielsen suffered a traumatic blood vessel rupture in his leg. His condition remained poor a month later. In 1913, Nielsen was badly injured by an automobile \\"kick,\\" possibly in Sacramento. His doctor advised him to keep away from the Bay in order to avoid rheumatism. He headed to San Jose and Paso Robles for a therapeutic mineral and mud bath. Nielsen suffered another automobile-related injury in 1928, while working in his home garage at the age of 69. A jack slipped while he worked beneath the car, crushing his hand. Clashes with the law In 1904, police officer Dennis Welch had Nielsen arrested on charges that Nielsen's dogs barked at night and kept him from sleeping. Later that year, one of Nielsen's dogs was reportedly poisoned. In 1913, Nielsen refused to pay a $36 per year business license for doing manual work as an automobile mechanic. He was arrested and taken before a judge on July 11. As with the dogs in 1904, Nielsen pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial. He argued that the ordinance unjustly compelled him to pay a license while blacksmiths, carpenters, and brick masons were not subject to such a license. According to the Oakland Tribune, Nielsen \\"the artisan\\" stated in court that if the judge \\"would pay a license for being a judge, he would be willing to pay for repairing automobiles.\\" He was released on payment of a $50 cash bond. Nielsen argued against paying for a business license by stating that his garage was simply a repair shop. The Alameda Daily reported that Nielsen argued that he did \\"not do a garage business, nor deal in supplies or commodities ... and that the only money he receives is what he earns repairing cars.\\" Nonetheless, classified listings indicate that Nielsen regularly sold vehicles from his garage before, during, and after 1913. Second marriage Nielsen's first wife Hansine died in San Rafael, California in 1925, and Nielsen remarried on April 14, 1933. At the age of 78, Nielsen and his former lodger Lilly Palmer, 47, married in Reno. Reno was known as a place for California couples to marry without waiting the three days required by California state law. The couple separated February 11, 1941. Nielsen pursued a divorce suit, charging Lilly with cruelty. At this point Nielsen was retired without income, and supporting his son Adolph, now blind. Meanwhile, Lilly, \\"a large strong woman of approximately 52 years of age, was earning $150 per month by using the house as a convalescent home. The judge denied Nielsen's request for $65 per month pending the divorce trial, but granted him temporary alimony of $150 to cover his attorney fees and issued a restraining order to prevent Lilly from \\"conveying or encumbering any of the community property.\\" Six months later, Nielsen dropped his divorce suit 10 minutes before the trial was set to begin, settling with Lilly out of court. The divorce was never finalized, and Lilly was listed as Nielsen's widow in his obituary. Nielsen was buried in Oakland's Mountain View Cemetery under a headstone with both of their names. Lilly is not buried with him.

Pereira was a co-recipient of the 1988 UNESCO Carlos J. Finlay Prize for Microbiology and was known for his work on the book, Viruses of Vertebrates. He contributed to several areas of virology in research and international public service. Early life and education Pereira was born in the town of Petrópolis in the state of Rio de Janeiro to Raul Pereira Geronymo (Portuguese, via the Azores) and Maria Gelli Pereira, of Italian origin. His early years were spent in Petrópolis, where he was influenced by his Italian-Brazilian family. Pereira began attending the Anglo-American Colégio Pitanga primary school in Rio de Janeiro in 1924. The school had no scientific facilities, and he believed that he barely passed his examinations. Despite this, Pereira entered the Faculty of Medicine in Niterói in 1928. Although the school in Niterói also had poor scientific equipment, his teachers were enthusiastic and Pereira worked toward a microbiology degree with the help of Arlindo de Assis and A. Monteiro Filho. Halfway through the course, he worked part-time as a technician in the clinical pathology laboratory of a local hospital. In 1941, Pereira received his medical diploma. The Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, where Pereira completed a postgraduate course in 1942 The following year, he began a postgraduate course in biology at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. After compulsory military service, Pereira returned and graduated with honors. Early work Pereira held several part-time positions, including in clinical pathology at public and private institutions, in 1943 and 1944. He completed assistantships in microbiology under A. Monteiro Filho, and in neurology under D. Couto. Chafing at the routine, Pereira received a British Council Scholarship to study microbiology in the UK. In England, he worked in the University of Manchester's department of microbiology under virology pioneer Hugh Bethune Maitland and bacterial taxonomist Samuel Tertius Cowan. Pereira then spent a short time at Liverpool University under Allan Watt Downie. After eight months in Manchester, Pereira moved to London to work at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) and spent a year working under Christopher Andrewes and W. J. Elford. He said about this time, \\"Although this period of postgraduate training did not lead to formal qualifications or published papers, it was certainly one of the most satisfactory and rewarding stages of my professional career\\". Pereira then became interested in laboratory research. He married in 1946 and returned to Rio de Janeiro the following year, beginning work as a clinical pathologist at a government hospital. Pereira soon left this position to join a research team directed by J. Travasso at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, studying rickettsia as a part-time assistant. In contrast to his previous work in Rio de Janeiro, he described the environment as \\"highly stimulating\\". At the institute, Pereira helped demonstrate the presence of murine typhus and tick-transmitted spotted fever in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The team also developed new methods to study rickettsial antigen-antibody reactions. Later career Common Cold Unit The National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, where Pereira worked for many years Political interference at the institute frustrated Pereira, who moved back to Britain in 1951 to work at the Medical Research Council's Common Cold Unit in Salisbury. He worked under Christopher Andrewes, head of bacteriology and virology at the National Institute for Medical Research. The team studied the issue of culturing the common cold virus in the laboratory, and Pereira was successful at the facility. He used equipment from the institute and its library, where he often met with other scientists in his field. During a 1953 study, Pereira propagated a common-cold virus in the laboratory for the first time. Unaware at the time of what he had achieved, he changed the direction of his work to adenoviruses. Pereira again did important work in this area, researching the reversal of the cytopathic effect of infected-cell extracts. When he was called an adenovirologist he often corrected the speaker, saying that he was an \\"adenovirologist type 5\\". Pereira spent several years working out the molecular structure of this icosahedral virus, including crystallising its subunits and producing images of the virus with electron microscopist Robin Valentine. In 1957, he became a naturalised British subject. Around this time, his wife began working at a local hospital in a division of the Public Health Laboratory Service. Pereira accepted a post in the same laboratory, and they moved their family back to Mill Hill. At this time, he also spent time at the Virus Reference Laboratory of the Central Public Health Laboratory in Colindale. Pereira returned to Brazil in 1960 and worked at the University of Brazil, punctuating his stay with occasional visits to England. He also went to Italy to work with N. Nardelli and A. Rinaldi on avian influenza. The importance of Pereira's work was recognised in 1961, when he became a director of the World Influenza Centre. Influenza He spent three months at the Universidad de Montevideo in Uruguay in 1963, and spent time at the University of São Paulo in 1965. Pereira left the Animal Virus Research Institute department at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill in 1973 to work at the Pirbright Institute (then the Institute for Animal Health), due to increased interest in comparative virology. Using contacts from his old department, he headed the new department of epidemiology at the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease. The department focused on researching exotic viral diseases and studying pathogenesis and vaccine development. Free from time-consuming administration, he enjoyed doing research there. That year, Pereira was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Around this time, his daughter died. Pereira retired from the Pirbright Institute in 1979 and became a scientific consultant at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, where he worked on the AIDS virus. In 1985, he was appointed head researcher at the institute. Pereira travelled between the UK and Brazil around this time, spending time with family in each country. He assisted and advised young scientists about local health problems between 1979 and 1985, developing new methods and discovering new viruses with his colleagues. Pereira's wife, Peggy, organised a study of viruses which caused acute respiratory illnesses in Rio de Janeiro children at this time. They contributed to a World Health Organization meeting in Rio about the respiratory diseases programme. Later life Shortly after Peggy retired from the Public Health Laboratory Service in 1987, she and Pereira were involved in a serious car accident in Rio de Janeiro. Peggy was killed, and he was seriously injured. During the late 1980s, Pereira was a visiting professor for a year at the University of London's St George's Medical School. Around that time, he was a visiting fellow for a year at the Centers for Disease Control's Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases in Atlanta. Pereira worked with Roger Glass on characterizing unusual picobirnaviruses found in the feces of HIV patients in Brazil. He died of heart failure on August 16, 1994. Personal life In 1946 Pereira married Marguerite \\"Peggy\\" Scott, daughter of William McDonald Scott (a senior medical officer at the UK Ministry of Health) and granddaughter of French Republic senator Antoine Mollard. They had one son and two daughters. Influenced by his parents, their son Raul Scott become an immunologist. Pereira was known as a man of \\"infectious good nature\\". For the March 1994 issue of Archives of Virology, Mahy and Murphy wrote: \\"His legacy is grounded in his unstinting good nature - his gentleness and warmth, his smile and sense of humor, his caring nature - and his great capacity for building lifelong friendships with so many virologists working in so many disciplines. His legacy is capped off by his many scholarly contributions to science and human welfare and to the affairs of the world's virologic community\\".

It was first published by David Philip in Cape Town in 1998. Plot The book, which is autobiographical fiction, describes the life of Jock Lundie (Strachan's nickname and middle name). The protagonist is born in Pretoria. As a young boy he is close to a German widow called Marthe Guldenpfennig. When his adoptive father dies, he moves with his mother and attends school in Pietermaritzburg. He enjoys the nurturing atmosphere and the arts and crafts in primary school. He keeps in touch with Guldenpfennig until she moves back to Darmstadt on the eve of the Second World War. When he goes to boarding school, he is able to avoid bullying by creative use of his artistic talents. With his best friend \\"Cheese\\" Kreis, he goes climbing in the Drakensberg mountains. After graduation he joins the South African Air Force near the end of the war. He learns to fly and to do aerobatics in the Tiger Moth, then does advanced bomber pilot training in the Airspeed Oxford. A Royal Air Force trainer called O'Dowd tells him that he was involved in the bombing of Darmstadt, where a firestorm was created and the entire city wiped out. Several of his friends, including \\"Cheese\\", are killed in flying accidents. Airspeed Oxford Style The book is loosely chronological but there are many diversions into South African history. It is written in South African English, with extensive use of Afrikaans phrases. The book is autobiographical fiction and was based on anecdotes he told. He has described how he tries to use the techniques of painting, such as contrast of texture, in his writing, and has expressed his admiration for the writing style of John Bunyan and Laurence Sterne, and the emotional authenticity of Thomas Hardy and Graham Greene. Background Strachan wrote an early draft of the book very quickly after a friend persuaded him to start writing in his 70s. Strachan's original title was So It Goes, a reference to the anti-war book Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut. He had intended the book to be an anti-war one: \\"I wanted it to be about four wars, ... because I'd known men from four imperial wars, you know – the Anglo-Zulu War, the Anglo-Boer War, World War 1, World War 2 – which I was in at the, at the gat kant\\". He was disappointed with the edited version that was published. The South African academic Zoë Molver contends that the book was \\"bowdlerised\\" in the editing process, giving examples of how the original language was edited to adjust racial terms and much material relating to historical background was excised. Reception The publisher, David Philip, described the book on its front cover as a \\"satirical novel\\". Dan Jacobson said in response, \\"While much of it is satirical in intention, as a whole it deserves a much grander designation. It is in fact a Bildungsroman, a novel describing the formation of a character or soul\\". He commented in the London Review of Books that Strachan had \\"seized eagerly on the expressive potentialities of South African English demotic speech ... in order to make something new and rare of it\\". He made a link between the protagonist's \\"call to arms\\" in the Second World War and the author's motivation in his involvement in the struggle against apartheid. David Evans said the publisher's description was inaccurate and that the book was the \\"first part of a semi-autobiographical trilogy\\". He also commented that \\"...the overall effect [is] rather like a multilayered painting, early touches being picked up later, the clever patterning only fully appreciated at the end\\". Sam Sole called Way Up, Way Out a \\"remarkable autobiography filled with rich and lunatic prose\\", and Athol Fugard described Strachan's \\"extraordinary gift for story telling which in my opinion makes him the rightful heir to the Herman Charles Bosman crown of our time\\". Jane Rosenthal wrote \\"Whether it is a memoir or a novel is interesting but irrelevant: it rings true\\".

Timeline 2015 In September 2015, Saudi-backed Yemeni forces loyal to the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi engaged Houthi forces and successfully established control over the eastern and western regions of Marib province. They took territory in Sirwah and Hareeb including the Hailan mountain, Al Ateef, Al Makhdarah, and Al Masaryah hill. Mar'ib is of particular strategic importance in the conflict because it is a center for oil & gas production in Yemen; the powerplants of Mar'ib supply power to a significant part of the country and a gas pipeline passes south through Marib to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The Safer Exploration and Production Operations Company and other foreign companies who work in the energy sector are based in Mar'ib, 52 Emirati soldiers, 10 Saudis and 5 Bahrainis were killed when a Houthi missile struck the coalition base at Safer in September 2015. 2016 The 2015 missile strike marked an escalation in the conflict. In the months that followed, coalition air strikes targeted more civilian sites than military targets. During the 18-month period, between 26 March 2015 and 2 August 2016 there were nearly 500 attacks in Mar'ib, which was located at the frontline of the battle between coalition and Houthi forces. In 2016 the Yemen Data Project reported that Saudi air raids had hit a market in Sirwah twenty-four times. In October, Houthi forces killed Major General Abdul-Rab al-Shadadi, a high-level pro- government commander.Top general in Yemen's Saudi-backed army killed. Reuters. Published 8 October 2016. Retrieved 22 October 2016. Several prominent Houthis, including militia leaders Hussain al-Mutawakel and Abu Jabar Ahmad al-Houthi, were captured by coalition forces. Coalition forces fought with Houthis for control over the route that runs from Yemen's capital Sanaa through Sirwah to Mar'ib. 2017 US drone strikes were reported in early 2017 after the election of President Donald Trump. This marked the first U.S. engagement in Yemen since the failed Yakla raid. In November 2017 the New York Times reported that Mar'ib was \\"an island of relative calm\\". 2020 On 18 January, a missile attack on a military training camp in the central province of Ma'rib killed at least 111 soldiers, while dozens were wounded. Yemeni government blamed Houthi rebels for the attack, as there was no claim of responsibility. The strike targeted a mosque as people met for prayer, military sources told Reuters. On 8 April, the Saudi-led coalition announced a two-week ceasefire, in part to avoid the COVID-19 pandemic. Saudi vice defence minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted that Saudi Arabia would contribute $500 million to the U.N. humanitarian response plan for Yemen in 2020 and another $25 million to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. On 27 May, Houthi fighters launched two ballistic missiles on the Saudi backed forces of the Hadi government in Marib province. One missile targeted an army headquarters and another a military camp. The attack left 7 officers dead, including the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Sagheer bin Aziz's son and nephew, both officers. Bin Aziz survived the attack. On 30 May, regional media reported the departure of American and Saudi servicemen from Marib province. One of the alleged reasons was to avoid Houthi attacks and missile strikes. On 3 June, an explosive device killed 9 Hadi Government soldiers and high-ranking officers, including the 81st Infantry Brigade Chief of Operations, Brigadier General Abdullah Ahmad Al Abdi and the Commander of the 2nd Battalion, Colonel Ali Omar Murad. Another Colonel was killed by another IED after going to the region to investigate. In the last weeks a total of 13 officers were killed in IED style of ambushes near the Seventh Military Region in Marib. On 21 June Houthi-led forces fought its way in the Baydha District, with the aim on reaching Mahilia area and attack Marib by the South. According to pro-Hadi government media the Houthi offensive on Al-Nahma area, Mahliyah District of Marib, left tribesmen loyal to the government and soldiers in a dire situation of being attacked from the South. On 24 June, media sources close to the Houthis reported the deaths of prominent commanders on Hadi Government forces including Lt. Col. Saleh Abdo Hashem al-Jamali, two Captains; Ibrahim al Akki and Adam Jarban, the Chief from the 4th Battalion, 141st Brigade. Several other soldiers were reported killed amid news of hospitals in Shabwa and Marib collapsing from battle casualties. On 30 June, Houthi forces made further advances on the north of Badya and the south of Marib, seizing 400 km2 of terrain and inflicting 250 killed, wounded and captured Pro-Hadi Government forces. On 12 August, Houthi sources reported advances on the Marib front against ISIS and Al-Qaeda forces located in the southeast of Marib and Saudi- led forces in the southwest. On 22 August, Houthi affiliated media said Houthi forces captured the Mas military camp in Northwest Marib, after defeating Hadi government forces and Islah party militias. The Mas military camp was twice unsuccessfully attacked by Houthi fighters on 4 April and 16 July, it is reportedly the main military base of Saudi Arabia-led forces in west Marib and overlooks the Saana Marib highway. On 1 September, Houthi media reported military advances made by the Houthi rebels on the district of Mahiliya in Marib Province. Advances were reported also on Al-Aqabah, Al-Mohalil Market, the Murad Mountain and villages of Ghubayb and Asha. On 7 September, Houthi forces made further advances in Marib Province closing into the Ma'rib city itself, Mohamed al-Bokhaiti a member of the Houthi movement informed in social media. By late September, the campaign had become a war of attrition.https://www.france24.com/en/20200925-last-stand-in-yemen-as-battle- for-oil-rich-province-rages On 8 October media close to the Houthis announced that a large force of Hadi government forces was defeated in the North of Marib and the area of Al-Khanjar camp in al Jawf governorate, at least 3 Colonels and many field commanders and soldiers were reported killed. Analysis According to Nadwa Dawsari, an expert of Yemen topics cited by The New Arab, the 2020 Houthi offensive in Yemen was the largest offensive launched by the Houthis since 2015 after the Aden offensive. He also considered that if the Houthis managed to capture Marib they would consolidate their advances on the North and could continue launching attacks towards Shabwah or Hadhramaut.

The gens must have been very old, as one of the original Servian tribes was named after it, suggesting that the Pollii were important landowners during the Roman monarchy. However, few Pollii are mentioned in history, and none of them attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state. A number of Pollii are known from inscriptions. Origin The nomen Pollius seems to be a patronymic surname derived from the old praenomen Paullus, \\"little\\", which was little used in historical times, except in its feminine form, Paulla, or as a cognomen, particularly by the great patrician house of the Aemilii. An alternative derivation would be from the surname Pollio, originally referring to one who polished arms. Chase classifies Pollius among those gentilicia which either originated at Rome, or are not known to have come from anywhere else.Chase, pp. 111, 129–132. Praenomina The Pollii used a variety of praenomina, especially Publius, Gaius, Marcus, Gnaeus, and Lucius, all of which were very common throughout Roman history. Other names appear occasionally, including Quintus and Numerius, of which the latter was widespread, but uncommon.

Samsara was released on 6 February 2018 for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Xbox One. The developer, Auckland based Marker Limited, states that versions for iOS and Android will follow shortly afterwards. Samsara is an original title from Marker, a New Zealand development studio best known for its contract work. Gameplay Samsara was on display for the public to play at PAX Australia 2017. It was reported that the puzzles were physics-based, and involved moving the player character from one point to another, in a game world divided into two halves horizontally. The upper world was described as \\"real\\" with the lower mirrored half described as a \\"Stranger Things inspired Upside-Down\\". The gameplay video shows the player selecting and rotating blocks from the right-hand side of the play area and dropping them into the gameworld. Blocks respond to gravity, and gravity is reversed in the lower, upside-down segment of the play area. The game comprises 77 levels across 6 realms. According to the developer Marker, blocks with different properties are introduced later in the game and more complex interaction with the environment, including thorns that wither or grow depending on the game character that passes them. Senior Producer Alex Humphries states that \\"the player uses very simple mechanics to solve increasingly intricate problems\\", stressing that \\"progression has been carefully tuned\\".

History and writing The poem first appeared in The New Yorker in 1984. It was the opening poem of Ashbery's 1984 collection The Wave. It was written soon after Ashbery almost died due to an infection. The poem is in part a reference to the epic poem Kalevala, which Ashbery revisited in his later poem \\"Finnish Rhapsody\\". Content Composition The poem loosely adheres to the form of a sonnet, with the traditional fourteen lines and the octet/seste of a Petrarchan sonnet. Adhering to the format was not intentional on Ashbery's part. Themes In her review of A Wave, Helen Vendler wrote that the poem deals with the pains of aging using clichés. Allusions and influences The poem is evocative of W. H. Auden's work. Auden had an influence on Ashbery early poetry, an influence that diminished over the course of his career.

It is designated a Grade I listed building.  History  St Mary’s was established in the first half of the 12th century as a daughter church of Beverley Minster, to serve Beverley’s trading community. It is a cruciform church, 197 feet in length, with aisled nave and chancel, south transept with east aisle, north transept with east chapel and crypt below, northeast chapel with adjoining sacristy and priests’ rooms above, and a crossing tower. A few 12th and early 13th century fragments remain scattered throughout the church. These are numerous enough to determine that by the mid-13th century, the church consisted of an aisle-less chancel and transepts, an aisled nave, and probably a crossing tower. East window of northeast chapel, built in the 1330s or 1340s. The stained glass is from the 19th century, by left Systematic rebuilding began in the late 13th century, during the Decorated period, when a large chapel was added on to the east side of the north transept. This was followed by the addition of a south aisle to the previously aisle-less chancel, in conjunction with a widening of east aisle of the south transept. The nave aisles were completely rebuilt in the early 14th century. In the 1330s or 1340s the chancel was given a north aisle, the three easternmost bays of which were made into a superb chapel with Flowing tracery and a tierceron-star vault. The mouldings of the tracery, windows, vault, and piers all merge fluidly with each other, unifying the space. The mouldings of the vault ribs on the north wall spring from the floor and form fluted columns without capitals, and on the south wall spring from the column capitals, intersecting and running through the arcade mouldings. Building work at St Mary’s ceased in the mid-14th century, as in so many cases throughout England, because of the Black Death. It did not resume until , when the west front was rebuilt in the Perpendicular style and a Perpendicular clerestory was added to the nave. The south porch and a clerestory for the chancel followed in the early 15th century. The transepts were rebuilt with clerestories in the mid-15th century; the Early Gothic arches were reused, but set on new piers. Bequests for this work were made in 1451-3, and further bequests in 1498–1500 funded the rebuilding of the west end of the nave aisles. Also installed throughout the 15th and into the 16th centuries were the series of fine wooden ceilings for which the building is known. The most recognized is the chancel ceiling, originally of the mid-15th century but entirely repainted in 1863, with depictions of forty English kings from the mythical Brutus through Henry VI, and a portrait of George VI from 1939. During Evensong on 29 April 1520, the central tower collapsed, ‘and overwhelmed some that then were in [the church]’. Much of the work on the eastern end of the nave was undone, though the aisle walls were little damaged. The central tower and the nave arcades and clerestory were entirely rebuilt, though the clerestory windows appear to be of : Pevsner suggests that \\"[p]ossibly they were reused in spite of the radical damage done by the falling tower\\". This rebuilding work began immediately after the collapse, the south arcade bearing an inscribed date of 1524 at both east and west ends. Those who gave money for the piers of the north arcade are commemorated in inscriptions on the hoodmould stops: merchant John Crossley and his wife; the good wives of Beverley; and the minstrels, five of whom are depicted as statues on corbels against their pier. The 19th century saw significant restoration undertaken at St. Mary’s, in 1829–30 under William Comins, then under A. W. N. Pugin in 1844–52. E. W. Pugin took over the work, and was followed by Cuthbert Brodrick, George Gilbert Scott (who refitted the nave and chancel), and numerous other architects.

It contained three individual games between the original launch and 2004: Vermeer (1987), Vermeer: Die Kunst zu erben (1997), and Vermeer: The Great Art Race (2004). The name of the game series is reminiscent of the Dutch painter Jan Vermeer. The game title of the original game contained a graphic that is similar to his famous work \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". In the game, however, the name stands for a fictional art forger named Vico Vermeer.  Description   Aim of the game  The action takes place in the 1920s. The game is playable in both single and multiplayer modes with up to 4 players (up to 5 in Vermeer 2). The aim of the game is to recover works of art which were lost in the first world war and which belong the players' dying uncle - the Berlin art collector Walter von Grünschild. Each player receives funding from the uncle which has to be increased by various means in order to enable the player to buy at auction various works of art as they come up for sale. The winner will inherit Walter von Grünschild's fortune and gain control of the corporate empire.  Game play  As the main source of income, the player engages in the acquisition of and trade in colonial goods. To this end, property is being acquired all over the world with up to twenty-four plantations for the cultivation of coffee, cocoa, silk, tea or tobacco. The harvested goods are then being sold at major trading venues in London and New York. Commodity forward transactions with individual customers are also possible. In addition, revenue can be generated through stock and foreign exchange trading and it is possible to win money at the racecourse. With the assets generated, a total of 40 paintings belonging to the uncle's former collection can be acquired at auction. If a player does not have sufficient knowledge of art, he can easily end up with a counterfeit. Numerous deceptively genuine reproductions of the art forger Vico Vermeer are in circulation. In order to generate a game score, only real works or art are counted. Images of the forger Vico Vermeer are accepted by the uncle, as long as none of the other players can present the corresponding original. In order conceal the pictures players are chasing, players can choose to be represented by intermediaries at auction. The global economic crisis and many other unforeseen events are troubling the players or offering opportunities and bringing him luck. Numerous gimmicks lighten up the game.

Three of Boston's largest cigar manufacturers chose to leave the city rather than meet the union's demands and a number of union members formed a cigar-making co-operative. By August 30, 1919, all of the remaining manufacturers had reached agreements with the union. Early labor struggles During the early years of World War I, Boston's cigar factories hired many refugees from Belgium. In addition to being expert cigar makers, many of them were socialists. After this, the manufacturers clashed with the local union, who threatened to strike if the manufacturers hired more employees, implemented the use of machinery, weighed tobacco, ended the practice of cigar makers using their mouths to shape cigars, or dismissed an employee without the consent of a union committee. On January 24, 1919, the Boston Cigar Makers' Union adopted a resolution calling for \\"all the land and workshops and public utilities\\" to \\"be conscripted for control by the A. F. of L., in the interest of all of the people\\" and that \\"the working class take over the control of wealth production\\". Cigar Makers' International Union President George W. Perkins criticized the amendment as an \\"attempt to fasten upon the International Union...a communistic, socialistic, soviet form of government\\". On June 19, 1919, Perkins wrote that the proposed strike by the cigar makers would \\"put the Boston seed cigar entirely out of the market...How much longer the Boston manufacturers can continue to pay these demands, with the many restrictions thrown around them, is a mighty serious question\\". Walkout On July 7, 1919, more than 2,000 of the 2,400 members of the Cigarmakers' Union, Local 97 walked out against manufacturers who failed to implement a 13 7/11% wage increase. This shut down Boston's large cigar manufacturers, including Waitt & Bond, H. Traiser, C. C. A., Breslin & Campbell, Elcho, M. C. A., and Alles & Fisher. A number of the smaller shops who had granted the increase were able to continue production. A strike at the R. G. Sullivan factory in Manchester, New Hampshire was ongoing at the time of the Boston strike. Gustave A. Rothfuss, secretary of the Boston Cigar Manufacturers' Association, accused Local 97 of making repeating wage demands and of striking without the sanction of the Cigar Makers' International Union. He also stated that the manufacturers would refuse to consider the cigar makers demand that \\"no firm shall discharge an employe without first consulting the grievance committee\\". Rothfuss claimed that the wage increase would raise the price of a ten-cent cigar to fifteen cents, while William Collins contended the increase would be less than 1/4th of a cent. Collins blamed the manufacturers for increased prices, stating that from 1906 to 1919, cigar manufacturers have increased their prices by $30 per 1,000 cigars, while cigar makers had only received a raise of $3.80 per 1,000 cigars made. Waitt & Bond cited increased wages of cigar packers, tobacco stripers, and general workers, increased federal taxes on cigars, increased tobacco prices, and other increased expenses, including freight and insurance rates, as the reason for the increased price and went on to state that Boston's cigar manufacturers were operating at the lowest profit since the establishment of the industry. Departure of manufacturers On August 13, 1919, Waitt & Bond announced that they would move from Boston to Newark, New Jersey as a result of the walkout. Prior to the strike, Waitt & Bond had employed 1,200 cigar makers and had a weekly payroll of $30,000. Upon moving to Newark, Waitt & Bond operated on a non-union machine production basis. Other cigars makers followed suit. C. C. A. also moved to Newark while Breslin & Campbell moved to New York City. Both switched to machine production. Co-operative Following Waitt & Bond and C. C. A.'s departure, the Boston Union Cigarmaker's Co-operative was formed. The Co-operative began with 50 cigar workers and $90,000 worth of capital. Morris Becker, a cigar maker who had put himself through Suffolk Law School, was the Co-operative's first manager. Its factory was a former bowling alley. Although all of the Co- operative's employees were union members, the union officially had nothing to do with the business. The Co-operative operated on a \\"one-man, one-vote\\" system, which entitled a member to only one vote no matter how many shares he held. By February 1920, 100 cigar makers were employed. By that December, the co-operative was the third largest cigar factory in Boston. On October 8, 1921, five creditors filed a bankruptcy petition against the Co-operative. According to the February 18, 1922 issue of Industrial Relations \\"Lack of business training, acumen and experience seems to be the generally accepted reason for the failure\\". All of the Co-operative's departments, except for bookkeeping and accounting, were staffed by cigar makers, which resulted in buyers and salesmen with little experience. Becker also criticized the accounting department, which he stated was \\"run by a man who owed his position to a feeling of sympathy by certain members\\". Industrial Relations also faulted the Co-operative for not making an effort to take advantage of special seasonal demands and stated that \\"the generally accepted...final blow was due to a decision of the Board of Directors not to center their activities in New England, but to open up a market in New York City\\". The Co-operative's rights were sold to a Boston cigar factory superintendent for $5,500. Resolution of the strike The strike ended on August 30, 1919 when the Sullivan factory in Manchester and the cigar makers agreed on a compromise of $20 per 1,000 cigars made (down from the union's original demand of $21). By that time, H. Traiser, Elcho, M. C. A., and Alles & Fisher had all resumed production.
