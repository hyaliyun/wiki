View of Ferns from Castle tower Ferns, 2017 ==History== Ferns is believed to have been established in the 6th century, when a monastery was founded in 598 dedicated to St Mogue of Clonmore (St. Aidan) who was a Bishop of Ferns.Blue Guide, Ireland. Brian Lalor. (p248) The town became the capital of the Kingdom of Leinster, and also the Capital of Ireland when the kings of that southern part of the province established their seat of power there. It was a very large city then but shrunk in the fire that destroyed most of it. The city stretched all the way down and further than the River Bann (tributary of the River Slaney), if it was not burnt it would've been one of Ireland's biggest cities today. King Dermot MacMurrough founded St. Mary's Abbey as a house of Augustinian canons c. 1158 and was buried there in 1171.T. O'Keeffe & R.

Dublin: Four Courts Press, 73-96 Ferns Castle, an Anglo-Norman fortress, was built in the middle of the 13th century by William, Earl Marshall. Today about half of the castle still stands. The town also contains the 13th-century St Edan's Cathedral (Church of Ireland) This was a big aisled cathedral with a long chancel. The present east wall of the cathedral is the original east wall; the cathedral ran further to the west, towards the entrance to the cemetery. It has been suggested that the ruined building to the east, which has a row of fine Gothic windows, might have been built to house the effigy of Bishop John St John, now in the porch of the church.T. O'Keeffe & R. Carey Bates, The abbey and cathedral of Ferns, 1111-1253, in Ian Doyle and Bernard Browne (eds) Medieval Wexford. Essays in memory of Billy Colfer. Dublin: Four Courts Press, 73-96 The Tower and the Chapter House were added on in the 19th century. The cemetery has several high crosses and parts of crosses. The 19th-century population peaked in 1851, but never reached the levels of medieval times. Lewis's Topography of 1834 claimed the town \\"consists chiefly of one irregular street, and contains 106 houses indifferently built, retaining no trace of its ancient importance\\". The Abbey, St.Peter's Church (Catholic and Anglican), and the remainder of the great cathedral are regarded as historic, holy places, and regarded as churches still, this includes the abbey which has the title of an abbey church. ==Annalistic references== See Annals of Inisfallen (AI) * AI741.1 Kl. Repose of Cúán.u, abbot of Ferna, and Flann.Feórna son of Colmán, king of Ciarraige Luachra, [died]. ==Church of St. Aidan== The old Catholic church stood at the north of the town until the 1970s, when it was decided to demolish the building. A convent, St. Aidan's Monastery of Adoration, has stood in its place since the early 1990s. The foundation stone of the new Church of St. Aidan was laid on the Feast of St. Aidan, 31 January 1974. This new Roman Catholic church was completed in 1975. In 2007, the new church went under a major refurbishment, and during 2007 and 2008 the parish replaced the old slates with new composite metal-material. The interior was also refurbished and few minor changes were made to the look of the building. A plaque listing the names of parish priests, from 1644, is on the wall to the right of the altar, beside the organ. The pipe organ in St. Aidan's Church dates from 1901. Its bellows were once inflated by hand, until modifications were made to it in the 1970s, one of which saw a new electric blower to inflate the bellows installed. The pipe organ was transferred from the old church to the new church and is still in use. Before being transferred, it was completely dismantled, re-shaped and re-designed to fit into a much smaller space, in the new church. The Bell, dating from 1911, was installed in the tower of St.Mogue's Church, by Canon John Doyle. It was moved and now stands outside the new Catholic Church today, and is rung on special occasions, such as the New Year's midnight celebrations, Christmas, and Easter. ==Religion and heritage== The town gave the name to the Diocese of Ferns (both Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland). The town's religious traditions live on today through the recent establishment in Ferns of a hermitage. The whole history of modern Ireland stems from Ferns – Diarmuid MacMurrough, King of Leinster invited the Normans in 1169 to help him fight his battles (they never left) – he sealed the deal with his daughter Aoife's marriage to Strongbow. Ferns has evidence of four distinct periods in Irish history. Archaeological digs have revealed habitations from the Bronze, Iron, early Christian and Norman eras. Ferns boasts many ecclesiastical sites dating from early Christian era through Norman and the Middle Ages. Heritage sites include :Ferns Castle (Visitor Centre May to end of September – 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Open daily, housing the Ferns Tapestries) :Cathedral graveyard The Grave of King Dermot MacMurrough :St. Mary’s Augustinian Abbey :St. Edan’s Cathedral :Remainder of the great Medieval Gothic Cathedral :Ferns High Crosses :St. Mogue’s Cottage :St. Peter’s Church :St. Mogue's Well :Monument to Father John Murphy (who was born near Ferns) :St.Aidan's Church (New Catholic Church) :St. Aidan’s Monastery of Adoration (Convent on the old Catholic church site) For further information on Ferns Heritage http://www.fernsvillage.ie/ferns-heritage-page.html ==Transport== Ferns is located on the R772 road, having been bypassed by the M11 motorway linking Dublin to Wexford since 18 July 2019. Regular (almost hourly) bus services link Ferns to Dublin and Rosslare are provided by a number of companies. Ferns railway station opened on 16 November 1863, closed to passenger traffic on 30 March 1964 and to goods traffic on 3 November 1975, before finally closing altogether on 7 March 1977. ==People== *Anne Doyle - former RTÉ newsreader *Dermot MacMurrough (d. 1171) - former King of Uí Cheinnselaig and Leinster *Gordon D'Arcy professional Ireland and Leinster rugby player ==See also== *Ferns Inquiry *List of towns and villages in Ireland. ==References== ==External links== *Ferns Village Website - Heritage, Community and Business *Roman Catholic diocese of Ferns *Heritage Ireland's page on Ferns Castle *Photos of Monastic sites in Ferns *Fáilte Ireland's description of Ferns *Northwexford.com's description of Ferns Category:Towns and villages in County Wexford Category:MacMorrough Kavanagh dynasty ","title":"Ferns, County Wexford"},{"id":"529468","text":"In mathematics, a remarkable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number.

From near its source in the Okefenokee Swamp, to its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean, it forms a portion of the border between the U.S. states of Georgia and Florida. The river also serves as the southernmost point in the state of Georgia. The St. Marys River rises as a tiny stream, River Styx, flowing from the western edge of Trail Ridge, the geological relic of a barrier island/dune system, and into the southeastern Okefenokee Swamp. Arching to the northwest, it loses its channel within the swamp, then turns back to the southwest and reforms a stream, at which point it becomes the St. Marys River. Joined by another stream, Moccasin Creek, the river emerges from the Okefenokee Swamp at Baxter, Florida/Moniac, Georgia. It then flows south, then east, then north, then east-southeast, finally emptying its waters into the Atlantic, near St. Marys, Georgia and Fernandina Beach, Florida. ==1805 incident== On 6 July 1805 Lieutenant Robert Pigot of arrived off the harbour in the French privateer schooner Matilda, which the British had captured three days earlier. On 7 July Pigot took Matilda twelve miles up the St Marys River to attack three vessels reported to be there. Along the way militia and riflemen fired on Matilda. Eventually the British reached the three vessels, which were lashed in a line across the river. They consisted of a Spanish privateer schooner and her two British prizes, the ship and the brig Ceres, which the Spanish privateer had captured some two months earlier. The Spaniards had armed Golden Grove with eight 6-pounder guns and six swivels, and given her a crew of 50 men. The brig too was armed with swivels and small arms. The Spanish schooner carried six guns and a crew of 70 men. Pigot engaged the vessels for an hour, and then after Matilda had grounded, took his crew in her boats and captured Golden Grove. The British then captured the other two vessels. Lastly, Pigot fired on a group of 100 militia, with a field gun, dispersing them. The British had two men killed, and 14 wounded, including Pigot, who had received two bullet wounds to head and one to a leg.

For more than a thousand years, Tibetan artists have played a key role in the cultural life of Tibet. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the Tibetan plateau. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, with the main forms being thangka, distemper paintings on cloth, Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings, and small statues in bronze, or large ones in clay, stucco or wood. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of Tibetan Buddhism and were manufactured in large workshops by monks and lay artists, who are mostly unknown. The art of Tibet may be studied in terms of influences which have contributed to it over the centuries, from other Chinese, Nepalese, Indian, and sacred styles. Many bronzes in Tibet that suggest Pala influence, are thought to have been either crafted by Indian sculptors or brought from India.Pala India, Maitreya – standing, OCTOBER 16, 2016 ==Mahayana Buddhist influence== Bronze statue of Buddha Akshobya, Tibet, 12th–13th century AD British MuseumBritish Museum Collection As Mahayana Buddhism emerged as a separate school in the 4th century AD, it emphasized the role of bodhisattvas, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to nirvana in order to assist others. From an early time, various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the Vajrayana (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity Chenrezig (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a yidam, or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice. ==Tantric influence== Dharmapala, Field Museum, Chicago. More specifically, Tibetan Buddhism contains Tantric Buddhism, also known as Vajrayana Buddhism for its common symbolism of the vajra, the diamond thunderbolt (known in Tibetan as the dorje). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities (yidams) to mandalas and all kinds of ritual implements. A surprising aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of wrathful deities, often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the Protectors (Skt. dharmapala) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the dharma teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner. ==Bön influence== The indigenous shamanistic religion of the Himalayas is known as Bön. Bon contributes a pantheon of local tutelary deities to Tibetan art. In Tibetan temples (known as lhakhang), statues of the Buddha or Padmasambhava are often paired with statues of the tutelary deity of the district who often appears angry or dark. These gods once inflicted harm and sickness on the local citizens but after the arrival of Padmasambhava these negative forces have been subdued and now must serve Buddha. ==Contemporary Tibetan art== Painting by Sonam Dolma Brauen, 2008 \\"visionary artists for tibet\\" exhibitionContemporary Tibetan art refers to the art of modern Tibet, or Tibet after 1950. It can also refer to art by the Tibetan diaspora, which is explicitly political and religious in nature.

This missile was somewhat similar in design to the R-11FM missile, which caused some confusion in Western intelligence services during the Cold War. The missiles were phased out from 1965 to 1975. This missile was the first Soviet design to use a small set of rocket engines (vernier thrusters) to perform course and trajectory alterations instead of aerodynamic control surfaces, although a set of four stabilizers were used to keep the missile on-course during initial flight.

When used as a cultural label especially within the culture, the word deaf is often written with a capital D and referred to as \\"big D Deaf\\" in speech and sign. When used as a label for the audiological condition, it is written with a lower case d. Carl G. Croneberg coined the term of \\"Deaf Culture\\" and he was the first to discuss analogies between Deaf and hearing cultures in his appendices C/D of the 1965 Dictionary of American Sign Language.Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press == Background == Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, in the sense of a community or culture, can then be seen as a minority group, and therefore some who are a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike some other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than needing to be born into it. Three views on Deaf people There are several perspectives on deaf people and Deaf culture that shape their treatment and role in society. From a medical standpoint, many encourage Deaf children to undergo surgery. Especially in the past, the medical perspective discouraged the use of sign language because they believed it would distract from development of auditory and speech skills. From a social standpoint, Deaf individuals are welcomed to participate in society in the same manner as any other individual. This view discourages the idea that those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing are sick and in need of a cure. The social view also encourages making accommodations for deaf people so that they can fully participate in society. Such accommodations include the use of interpreters or improved closed captioning systems. Many feel, however, that the social view fails to recognize the unique qualities of Deaf people and Deaf culture. They believe that this perspective asks Deaf people to fit and find their own way in a predominantly hearing society, instead of recognizing their own abilities and culture. Another perspective is referred to as the cultural-linguistic view. Supporters of Deaf Culture state that this perspective appropriately recognizes Deaf people as a minority culture in the world with their own language and social norms. This standpoint is believed to promote Deaf people's right to collective space within society to pass on their language and culture to future generations.Lane, Harlan L.; Richard Pillard; Ulf Hedberg (2011). The People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry. Oxford University Press. p. 269.

The community can provide support, easy social interaction, and \\"refuge from the grinding frustrations of the hearing world.\\" Conversely, Deaf individuals who are not a part of the Deaf community may not have the same support in the hearing world, resulting in lower self-esteem. Stereotypes, lack of knowledge, and negative attitudes about Deafness cause widespread discrimination. This could lead to a lower education and economic status for deaf people. Deaf Community The community may include hearing family members of deaf people and sign-language interpreters who identify with Deaf culture. It does not automatically include all people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. As educator and American Sign Language interpreter Anna Mindess writes, \\"it is not the extent of hearing loss that defines a member of the deaf community but the individual's own sense of identity and resultant actions.\\" As with all social groups that a person chooses to belong to, a person is a member of the Deaf community if he/she \\"identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community.\\" Deaf culture is recognized under Article 30, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which states that \\"Persons with disabilities shall be entitled, on an equal basis with others, to recognition and support of their specific cultural and linguistic identity, including sign languages and deaf culture.\\" ==Acculturation== Merikartano school for deaf students in left Acquisition of Deaf Culture Students at a school for deaf students in left Historically, acculturation has often occurred within schools for Deaf students and within Deaf social clubs, both of which unite deaf people into communities with which they can identify. Becoming Deaf culturally can occur at different times for different people, depending on the circumstances of one's life. A small proportion of deaf individuals acquire sign language and Deaf culture in infancy from Deaf parents, others acquire it through attendance at schools, and yet others may not be exposed to sign language and Deaf culture until college or a time after that. Although up to fifty percent of deafness has genetic causes, fewer than five percent of deaf people have a deaf parent,Mitchell, Ross E. & Karchmer, Michael A. (2004) Chasing the mythical ten percent: Parental hearing status of deaf and hard of hearing students in the United States. Sign Language Studies 4:2, 138–163. so Deaf communities are unusual among cultural groups in that most members do not acquire their cultural identities from parents. ===Diversity within Deaf culture=== Educator and ASL interpreter Anna Mindess notes that there is \\"not just one homogeneous deaf culture\\". There are many distinct Deaf communities around the world, which communicate using different sign languages and exhibit different cultural norms. Deaf identity also intersects with other kinds of cultural identity. Deaf culture intersects with nationality, education, race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, and other identity markers, leading to a culture that is at once quite small and also tremendously diverse. The extent to which people identify primarily with their deaf identity rather than their membership in other intersecting cultural groups also varies. Mindess notes a 1989 study, which found that \\"87 percent of black deaf people polled identified with their black culture first\\". == Education == Deaf culture is prevalent in schools for the deaf. There are K–12 schools for the deaf throughout the world and the United States, however higher education specifically for the deaf is more limited. Abbé Charles-Michel de l'Épée opened the first school for the deaf in Paris at the deaf school. The American Thomas Gallaudet witnessed a demonstration of deaf teaching skills from Épée's successor Abbé Sicard and two of the school's deaf faculty members, Laurent Clerc and Jean Massieu; accompanied by Clerc, he returned to the United States, where in 1817 they founded American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. American Sign Language (ASL) started to evolve from primarily French Sign Language (LSF), and other outside influences. In a residential school where all the children use the same communication system (whether it is a school using sign language, Total Communication or Oralism), students will be able to interact normally with other students, without having to worry about being criticized. An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom. === United States === In comparison to the general public, deaf people have lower levels of educational achievement.Christiansen, John B. “Sociological Implications of Hearing Loss.” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, vol. 630, no. 1 Genetics of H, 1991, pp. 230–235.,doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb19592.x. Advocates in deaf education believe that an improved recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) as an official language would improve education, as well as economic status. Some argue that by improving the recognition of ASL, better access to school materials, deaf teachers, interpreters, and video- telephone communication would take place.Padden, Carol, and Tom Humphries. Deaf in America: Voices from a Culture. Harvard University Press, 2003. Gallaudet University's Chapel Hall Three colleges within the United States are often identified as the best providers of higher education for deaf people. Referred to often as the \\"Big Three,\\" these include California State University at Northridge (CSUN), National Technical Institute for the Deaf (part of Rochester Institute of Technology), and Gallaudet University. Gallaudet University is the first and only liberal-arts college for deaf students in the world. Texas School for the Deaf Those who are deaf (by either state or federal standards) have access to a free and appropriate public education. If a child does qualify as being deaf or hard of hearing and receives an individualized education plan, the IEP team must consider, \\"the child's language and communication needs. The IEP must include opportunities for direct communication with peers and professionals. It must also include the student’s academic level, and finally must include the students full range of needs\\" In part, the Department of Education defines deafness as \\"... a hearing impairment that is so severe that the child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, with or without amplification ....\\" Hearing impairment is defined as \\"... an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness ....\\" === Other countries === Although the United States leads in higher education opportunities for the deaf, there are colleges across the globe. Brazil has several institutions, including Instituto Santa Tersinha and Escola para Crianças Surdas Rio Branco. China's deaf universities include Beijing Union University, Special Education College of Beijing University, and Zhongzhou University. Other notable universities for the deaf across the globe include Finland School for the Deaf (Finland), Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris (France), Berlin School for the Deaf (Germany), and Northwest Secondary School for the Deaf (South Africa.) ==Characteristics== Sign language is just one part of deaf culture. Deaf identity is also constructed around specific beliefs, values and art. ===Sign languages=== Sign languages are an important part of Deaf culture. The American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet is shown here. The sign language for \\"friend\\". Members of Deaf cultures communicate via sign languages. Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. \\"Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information\\". There are over 200 distinct sign languages in the world. These include 114 sign languages listed in the Ethnologue database and 157 more sign languages, systems, and dialects.Harrington, Thomas. \\"Sign language of the world by name.\\" n. page. Print. While the United Kingdom and the United States are both predominantly English speaking, the predominant signed languages used in these countries differ markedly. Due to the origins of deaf education in the United States, American Sign Language is most closely related to French Sign Language. ===Values and beliefs=== * A positive attitude towards deafness is typical in Deaf cultural groups. Deafness is not generally considered a condition that needs to be fixed. * The term \\"Deaf Gain\\" is used by Deaf people, to re-frame the perceived losses of Deafness and \\"hearing loss\\" to highlight the benefits of being deaf. According to deaf scientist Michele Cooke, it describes the benefits that Deaf people provide the larger community.Cochlear Implant - A surgically implanted device used by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people to improve hearing. * The use of a sign language is central to Deaf cultural identity. Oralist approaches to educating deaf children thereby pose a threat to the continued existence of Deaf culture. Some members of Deaf communities may also oppose technological innovations like cochlear implants for the same reason. * Culturally, Deaf people value the use of natural sign languages that exhibit their own grammatical conventions, such as American Sign Language and British Sign Language, over signed versions of English or other oral languages. Spoken English, written English and signed English are three different symbolic systems for expressing the same language. * Deaf communities strongly oppose discrimination against deaf people. * Deaf culture in the United States tends to be collectivist rather than individualist; culturally Deaf people value the group. ===Behavioral patterns=== * Culturally Deaf people have rules of etiquette for getting attention, walking through signed conversations, leave- taking, and otherwise politely negotiating a signing environment. * Deaf people also keep each other informed of what is going on in one's environment. It is common to provide detailed information when leaving early or arriving late; withholding such information may be considered rude. * Deaf people may be more direct or blunt than their hearing counterparts. * When giving introductions, Deaf people typically try to find common ground; since the Deaf community is relatively small, Deaf people usually have other Deaf people in common. * Deaf people may also consider time differently. Showing up early to large-scale events, such as lectures, is typical. This may be motivated by the need to get a seat that provides the best visual clarity for the Deaf person. ===Importance of technology=== *Like all other people, Deaf individuals rely on technology for communication significantly. In the United States, video relay services and an array of freestanding and software-driven video phones are often used by deaf people to conduct telephonic communication with hearing and deaf businesses, family and friends. Devices such as the teletype (known as a TTY, an electronic device used for communication over a telephone line) are far less common, but are used by some deaf people who are without access to high-speed Internet or have a preference for these methods for their telephonic communication. *Technology is even important in face-to-face social situations. For example, when deaf people meet a hearing person who does not know sign language, they often communicate via the notepad on their cell phones. Here, technology takes the place of a human sense, allowing deaf individuals to successfully communicate with different cultures. *Social media tends to be of great importance to deaf individuals. Networking sites allow deaf people to find each other and to remain in contact. Many deaf people have deaf friends throughout the entire country that they met or maintain contact with through online communities. Because the deaf community is so small, for many deaf people, the stigma of meeting others online does not exist. *Closed Captioning must be available on a television in order for a deaf person to fully appreciate the audio portion of the broadcast. Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through stand-alone devices, glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released. *Alert systems such as fire alarms and alarm clocks must appeal to different senses in order for a deaf individual to notice the alert. Objects such as vibrating pillows and flashing lights often take the place of the noise-based alarms. *Lack of understanding about technological accessibility for the deaf causes conflict and injustice for the deaf community. For example, a significant number of deaf individuals in the UK admit that they are dissatisfied with their banks because of their heavy reliance on telephone banking and lack of assistance to deaf and hard- of-hearing individuals. *Architecture that is conducive to signed communication minimizes visual obstructions and may include such things as automatic sliding doors to free up the hands for continuous conversation. ===Literary traditions and the arts=== A strong tradition of poetry and storytelling exists in American Sign Language and other sign languages. Some prominent performers in the United States include Clayton Valli, Ben Bahan, Ella Mae Lentz, Manny Hernandez, C. J. Jones, Debbie Rennie, Patrick Graybill, Peter Cook, and many others. Their works are now increasingly available on video. Literacy Traditions and Arts Culturally Deaf people have also represented themselves in the dominant written languages of their nations. Deaf artists such as Betty G. Miller and Chuck Baird have produced visual artwork that conveys a Deaf worldview. Douglas Tilden was a famous Deaf sculptor who produced many different sculptures in his lifetime. Some Deaf artists belong to an art movement called De'VIA, which stands for Deaf View Image Art. Organizations such as the Deaf Professional Arts Network or D-PAN are dedicated to promoting professional development and access to the entertainment, visual and media arts fields for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Daily Moth was established by Alex Abenchuchan in 2017 to make the news accessible for Deaf ASL users. ===History=== In the United States, the Cobbs School, a deaf school in Virginia, was established in 1815. This school lasted only one and half years due to financial setbacks. American Deaf Community recounts the story of Laurent Clerc, a deaf educator, coming to the United States from France in 1817 to help found the first permanent school for deaf children in the country now named American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. American School is the first official school for the deaf. Another well-known event is the 1880 Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf in Milan, Italy, where hearing educators voted to embrace oral education and remove sign language from the classroom. This effort resulted in pressure around the world to abandon sign language in favor of the oral approach exclusively. The intent of the oralist method was to teach deaf children to speak and lip read with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom in order to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The Milan conference recommendations were repudiated in Hamburg a century later,Brill, Richard G. 1984. International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980, Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 25. and sign languages in education came back into vogue after the publication of Stokoe's linguistic analyses of ASL. ===Shared institutions=== Women's art class at State School of the Deaf, Delavan, Wisconsin, c. 1880 Deaf culture revolves around such institutions as residential schools for deaf students, universities for deaf students (including Gallaudet University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf), deaf clubs, deaf athletic leagues, communal homes (such as The Home for Aged and Infirm Deaf-Mutes, founded by Jane Middleton, in New York City), deaf social organizations (such as the Deaf Professional Happy Hour), deaf religious groups, deaf theaters, and an array of conferences and festivals, such as the Deaf Way II Conference and Festival and the World Federation of the Deaf conferences. Deaf clubs, popular in the 1940s and 1950s, were also an important part of deaf culture. During this time there were very few places that the deaf could call their own– places run by deaf people for deaf people. Deaf clubs were the solution to this need. Money was made by selling alcohol and hosting card games. Sometimes these ventures were so successful that the building used by the club was able to be purchased. However, the main attraction of these clubs was that they provided a place that deaf people could go to be around other deaf people, sometimes sharing stories, hosting parties, comedians, and plays. Many of today's common ABC stories were first seen at deaf clubs. The clubs were found in all of the major cities, New York City being home to at least 12. These clubs were an important break from their usually solitary day spent at factory jobs. In the 1960s, deaf clubs began their quick and drastic decline. Today there are only a few spread-out deaf clubs found in the United States and their attendance is commonly small with a tendency to the elderly. This sudden decline is often attributed to the rise of technology like the TTY and closed captioning for personal TVs. With other options available for entertainment and communication, the need for deaf clubs grew smaller. It was no longer the only option for getting in touch with other members of the deaf community. However, others attribute the decline of deaf clubs to the end of World War II and a change in the job market. During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers and a promise of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move to bigger cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World War II ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular. Deaf African-American institutions The National Black Deaf Advocates was established in 1982 \\"to promote the leadership development, economic and educational opportunities, social equality, and to safeguard the general health and welfare of Black deaf and hard-of-hearing people.\\" Deaf LGBT institutions The Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf is a nonprofit established in 1977 to, \\"establish and maintain a society of Deaf LGBT to encourage and promote the educational, economical, and social welfare; to foster fellowship; to defend our rights; and advance our interests as Deaf LGBT citizens concerning social justice; to build up an organization in which all worthy members may participate in the discussion of practical problems and solutions related to their social welfare. RAD has over twenty chapters in the United States and Canada.\\" There is also the American deaf resource center Deaf Queer Resource Center (DQRC), the Hong Kong Bauhinias Deaf Club, and the Greenbow LGBT Society of Ireland. Deaf religious institutions There are deaf churches (where sign language is the main language), deaf synagogues, deaf Jewish community centers, and the Hebrew Seminary of the Deaf in Illinois. In 2011 the Conservative Movement unanimously passed the rabbinic responsa, \\"The Status of the Heresh [one who is deaf] and of Sign Language,\\" by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS). This responsa declared that, among other things, \\"The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards rules that the deaf who communicate via sign language and do not speak are no longer to be considered mentally incapacitated. Jews who are deaf are responsible for observing mitzvot. Our communities, synagogues, schools, and camps must strive to be welcoming and accessible, and inclusive. Sign language may be used in matters of personal status and may be used in rituals. A deaf person called to the Torah who does not speak may recite the berakhot via sign language. A deaf person may serve as a shaliah tzibbur in sign language in a minyan whose medium of communication is sign language.\\" Deaf women's institutions There are 15 chapters of Deaf Women United throughout the United States; its mission is, \\"to promote the lives of Deaf women through empowerment, enrichment, and networking.\\" There is also Pink Wings of Hope, an American breast cancer support group for deaf and hard-of-hearing women. ===Libraries and the Deaf community=== Deaf people at the library have the same needs as other library patrons, but they often have more difficulty accessing materials and services. Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for Deaf patrons and are working harder every year to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible. The American Library Association considers disabled people, including the Deaf, as a minority that is often overlooked by library staff. However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made improvements in library accessibility in general and to the Deaf community specifically. One of the first activists in the library community working toward accessibility for the Deaf was Alice Hagemeyer. When disabled communities began demanding equality in the 1970s, Hagemeyer decided to go back to school for her master's degree in library science. While she was studying there, she realized that there was not very much information about the Deaf community at her library or at the libraries of any of her classmates. She soon became an activist for Deaf awareness at her library, and she became the first \\"Librarian for the Deaf Community\\" from any public library in the nation. Hagemeyer also constructed a manual of resources for Deaf people and those associated with them called The Red Notebook. This notebook is now an online resource, which is available at the website of the Friends of Libraries for Deaf Action. Hagemeyer was one of the first library activists to make strides for the Deaf community.Hagemeyer, A. L. (2001). Achievement: From a lack of knowledge to an appreciation of Deaf history. IFLA Conference Proceedings, 1–3. Australian librarian Karen McQuigg states that \\"even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively.\\" There was a dearth of information for or about the Deaf community available in libraries across the nation and around the globe. New guidelines from library organizations such as International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the Deaf community. IFLA's Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People is one such set of guidelines, and it was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for Deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that Deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the Deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with Deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the Deaf community.Day, J. M. (2000). Guidelines for library services to deaf people (Report no. 62). The Hague: International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. Over the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local Deaf communities. At the Queens Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the Deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about Deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for Deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.Hollander, P. (1995). Deaf-advocacy at Queens Borough PL. American Libraries, 26(6), 560–562. ===Deaf services=== The library at Gallaudet University, the only Deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The library created a hybrid classification system based on an extension of the Dewey decimal system because traditional Dewey was not fine-grained enough to handle thousands of books in relatively small classification areas such as audiology or Deaf communication. The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.Harrington, T.R. (1998). The Deaf collection at the Gallaudet University Library. Education Libraries, 22(3), 5–12. In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the Deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, Deaf culture, and information for family members of Deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.Cohen, S. (2006). Have you heard about the Library Services for the Deaf & Hard of Hearing?

It encompasses a vast number of results that describe how do certain graph properties - number of vertices (size), number of edges, edge density, chromatic number, and girth, for example - guarantee the existence of certain local substructures.The Turán graph T(n,r) is an example of an extremal graph. It has the maximum possible number of edges for a graph on n vertices without (r + 1)-cliques. This is T(13,4). One of the main objects of study in this area of graph theory are extremal graphs, which are maximal or minimal with respect to some global parameter, and such that they contain (or do not contain) a local substructure- such as a clique, or an edge coloring. ==Examples== Extremal graph theory can be motivated by questions such as the following: Question 1. What is the maximum possible number of edges in a graph on n vertices such that it does not contain a cycle? If a graph on n vertices contains at least n edges, then it must also contain a cycle. Moreover, any tree with n vertices contains n-1 edges and does not contain cycles; trees are the only graphs with n-1 edges and no cycles. Therefore, the answer to this question is n-1, and trees are the extremal graphs. Question 2. If a graph on n vertices does not contain any triangle subgraph, what is the maximum number of edges it can have? Mantel's Theorem answers this question – the maximal number of edges is \\\\lfloor n^{2}/4 \\\\rfloor. The corresponding extremal graph is a complete bipartite graph on (\\\\lceil n/2\\\\rceil, \\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor) vertices, i.e., the two parts differ in size by at most 1. A generalization of Question 2 follows: Question 3. Let r be a positive integer. How many edges must there be in a graph G on n vertices in order to guarantee that, no matter how the edges are arranged, the clique K_{r} can be found as a subgraph? The answer to this question is \\\\frac{r-2}{r-1}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{n^{2}}{2}+ 1 and it is answered by Turán's Theorem. Therefore, if a graph G on n vertices is K_{r}-free, it can have at most \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{(r-2) n^2}{2(r-1)} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\left( 1- \\\\frac{1}{r-1} \\\\right) \\\\frac{n^2}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor many edges; the corresponding extremal graph with that many edges is the Turán graph, shown in the figure above. It is the complete join of r-1 independent sets (with sizes as equal as possible – such a partition is called equitable). The following question is a generalization of Question 3, where the complete graph K_r is replaced by any graph H: Question 4. Let r be a positive integer, and H any graph on r vertices. How many edges must there be in a graph G on n vertices in order to guarantee that, no matter how the edges are arranged, H is a subgraph of G? This question is mostly answered by the Erdős–Stone theorem. The main caveat is that for bipartite H, the theorem does not satisfactorily determine the asymptotic behavior of the extremal edge count. For many particular (classes of) bipartite graphs, determining the asymptotic behavior remains an open problem. Several foundational results in extremal graph theory answer questions which follow this general formulation: Question 5. Given a graph property P, a parameter u=u(G) describing a graph, and a set of graphs \\\\mathcal{S}, we wish to find the minimal possible value u_0 such that every graph G\\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} with u(G)\\\\geq u_0 has property P. Additionally, we might want to describe graphs G which are extremal in the sense of having u(G) close to u_0 but which do not satisfy the property P. In Question 1, for instance, \\\\mathcal{S} is the set of n-vertex graphs, P is the property of containing a cycle, u is the number of edges, and the cutoff is u_0=n. The extremal examples are trees. ==History== Mantel's Theorem (1907) and Turán's Theorem (1941) were some of the first milestones in the study of Extremal graph theory. In particular, Turán's theorem would later on become a motivation for the finding of results such as the Erdős-Stone-Simonovits Theorem (1946). This result is surprising because it connects the chromatic number with the maximal number of edges in an H-free graph. An alternative proof of Erdős-Stone-Simonovits was given in 1975, and utilised the Szemerédi regularity lemma, an essential technique in the resolution of extremal graph theory problems. ==Density results and inequalities== A global parameter which has an important role in extremal graph theory is subgraph density; for a graph G=(V,E) and a graph H, its subgraph density is defined as t(H,G)=(\\\\text{number of copies of }H\\\\text{ in }G)/\\\\binom{n}{V(H)}. In particular, edge density is the subgraph density for H=K_{2}: t(K_{2},G)=E/\\\\binom{V}{2} The theorems mentioned above can be rephrased in terms of edge density. For instance, Mantel's Theorem implies that the edge density of a triangle-free subgraph is at most 1/2. Turán's theorem implies that edge density of K_{r}-free graph is at most (r-2/r-1)+o(1). Moreover, the Erdős-Stone-Simonovits theorem states that \\\\mbox{ex}(n; H) = \\\\left( 1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\chi(H)-1} + o(1) \\\\right){n\\\\choose2}, where ex(n;H) is the maximal number of edges that an H-free graph on n vertices can have, and \\\\chi(H) is the chromatic number of H. An interpretation of this result is that the edge density of an H-free graph is asymptotically 1-(1/(\\\\chi(H)-1)). Another result by Erdős, Rényi and Sós (1966) shows that graph on n vertices not containing C_{4} as a subgraph has at most the following number of edges. \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}+o(1)\\\\right) n^{3/2} ==Minimum degree conditions== The theorems stated above give conditions for a small object to appear within a (perhaps) very large graph. Another direction in extremal graph theory is looking for conditions that guarantee the existence of a structure that covers every vertex. Note that it is even possible for a graph with n vertices and \\\\binom{n-1}{2} edges to have an isolated vertex, even though almost every possible edge is present in the graph. Edge counting conditions give no indication as to how the edges in the graph are distributed, leading to results which only find bounded structures on very large graphs. This provides motivation for considering the minimum degree parameter, which is defined as : \\\\delta(G)=\\\\min_{v\\\\in G} d(v) . A large minimum degree eliminates the possibility of having some 'pathological' vertices; if the minimum degree of a graph G is 1, for example, then there can be no isolated vertices (even though G may have very few edges). An extremal graph theory result related to the minimum degree parameter is Dirac's theorem, which states that every graph G with n vertices and minimum degree at least n/2 contains a Hamilton cycle. Another theorem says that if the minimum degree of a graph G is \\\\delta\\\\geq 3, and the girth is g\\\\geq 3, then the number of vertices in the graph is at least n_{0}(\\\\delta,g)=\\\\begin{cases}1+\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{\\\\delta-2}[(\\\\delta-1)^{(g-1)/2}-1] & \\\\text{if }g\\\\text{ is odd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\frac{2}{\\\\delta-2}[(\\\\delta-1)^{g/2}-1] & \\\\text{if }g\\\\text{ is even} \\\\end{cases}. == Some open questions == Even though many important observations have been made in the field of extremal graph theory, several questions still remain unanswered. For instance, Zarankiewicz problem asks what is the maximum possible number of edges in a bipartite graph on n vertices which does not have complete bipartite subgraphs of size m. Another important conjecture in extremal graph theory was formulated by Sidorenko in 1993. It is conjectured that if H is a bipartite graph, then its graphon density (a generalized notion of graph density) t(H,W) is at least t(K_{2},W)^{v(H)}. ==See also== *Ramsey theory *Graph density inequalities *Forbidden subgraph problem *Dependent random choice ==Notes== ==References== * . * . * . * M.

His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions. ==Biography== London was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland) as the son of Franz London (1863-1917). Being a Jew, London lost his position at the University of Berlin after Hitler's Nazi Party passed the 1933 racial laws. He took visiting positions in England and France, and emigrated to the United States in 1939, of which he became a naturalized citizen in 1945. Later in his life, London was a professor at Duke University. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1953. He died from a heart ailment in Durham, North Carolina, in 1954. ==Academic achievements== Fritz London at the Bunsen Congress, Munich, 1928 London's early work with Walter Heitler on chemical bonding is now treated in any textbook on physical chemistry. This paper was the first to properly explain the bonding in a homonuclear molecule such as H2. It is no coincidence that the Heitler–London work appeared shortly after the introduction of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg and Schrödinger, because quantum mechanics was crucial in their explanation of the covalent bond. Another necessary ingredient was the realization that electrons are indistinguishable, as expressed in the Pauli principle. Other early work of London was in the area of intermolecular forces. He coined the expression \\"dispersion effect\\" for the attraction between two rare gas atoms at large (say about 1 nanometer) distance from each other. Nowadays this attraction is often referred to as \\"London force\\". In 1930 he gave (together with R. Eisenschitz) a unified treatment of the interaction between two noble gas atoms that attract each other at large distance, but repel each other at short distances. Eisenschitz and London showed that this repulsion is a consequence of enforcing the electronic wavefunction to be antisymmetric under electron permutations. This antisymmetry is required by the Pauli principle and the fact that electrons are fermions. For atoms and nonpolar molecules, the London dispersion force is the only intermolecular force, and is responsible for their existence in liquid and solid states. For polar molecules, this force is one part of the van der Waals force, along with forces between the permanent molecular dipole moments. London was the first theoretical physicist to make the fundamental, and at the time controversial, suggestion that superfluidity is intrinsically related to the Einstein condensation of bosons, a phenomenon now known as Bose–Einstein condensation. Bose recognized that the statistics of massless photons could also be applied to massive particles; he did not contribute to the theory of the condensation of bosons. London was also one of the early authors (including Schrödinger) to have properly understood the principle of local gauge invariance (Weyl) in the context of the then new quantum mechanics. London predicted the effect of flux quantization in superconductors and with his brother Heinz postulated that the electrodynamics of superconductors is described by a massive field. I.e. that whilst magnetic flux is expelled from a superconductor, this happens exponentially over a finite length with an exponent which is now called the London penetration depth. London also developed a theory of a rotational response of a superconductor, pointing out that rotation of a superconductor generates magnetic field London moment. This effect is used in models of rotational dynamics of neutron stars. ==Fritz London Memorial Lectures and Prize== Since 1956, the Fritz London Memorial Lectures have brought to the scientific community at Duke University a distinguished group of lecturers including twenty Nobel laureates. The scientific interests of each lecturer impinge at one or more points upon the various fields of physics and chemistry to which Fritz London contributed. In December 1972, John Bardeen, two-time winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, established an endowment fund \\"to perpetuate the memory of Fritz London, distinguished scientist and member of the Duke faculty from 1939 to the time of his death in 1954, and to promote research and understanding of Physics at Duke University and in the wider scientific community\\". The fund is to be used to underwrite the Fritz London Memorial Prize, given in recognition of outstanding contributions in Low Temperature Physics, and provide support for the London Memorial Lectures at Duke University.Fritz London Memorial lecture ==References== ==External links== *Gavroglu, Kostas Fritz London: A Scientific Biography (Cambridge, 2005) *Fritz London: A Scientific Biography , by Kostas Gavroglu, Cambridge University Press (1995). . * Article about Fritz London * Article from Duke Physics Dept. *Key Participants: Fritz London - Linus Pauling and the Nature of the Chemical Bond: A Documentary History Category:1900 births Category:1954 deaths Category:People from Durham, North Carolina Category:Scientists from Wrocław Category:People from the Province of Silesia Category:20th-century American physicists Category:Duke University faculty Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Jewish physicists Category:Lorentz Medal winners Category:Quantum physicists Category:Theoretical physicists Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ","title":"Fritz London"},{"id":"529593","text":"The Congress of Soviets was the supreme governing body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and several other Soviet republics from 1917 to 1936 and again from 1989 to 1991.

Launched in 1967, TOPS-10 evolved from the earlier \\"Monitor\\" software for the PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers; this was renamed to TOPS-10 in 1970. == Overview == TOPS-10 supported shared memory and allowed the development of one of the first true multiplayer computer games. The game, called DECWAR,http://hsnewman.freeshell.org/decwar.htm The Decwar Page was a text-oriented Star Trek type game. Users at terminals typed in commands and fought each other in real time. TOPS-10 was also the home of the original Multi User Dungeon, MUD, the fore runner to today's MMORPGs. Another groundbreaking application was called FORUM. This application was perhaps the first so-called CB Simulator that allowed users to converse with one another in what is now known as a chat room. This application showed the potential of multi-user communication and led to the development of CompuServe's chat application. TOPS-10 had a very robust application programming interface (API) that used a mechanism called a UUO or Unimplemented User Operation. UUOs implemented operating system calls in a way that made them look like machine instructions. The Monitor Call API was very much ahead of its time, like most of the operating system, and made system programming on DECsystem-10s simple and powerful. The TOPS-10 scheduler supported prioritized run queues, and appended a process onto a queue depending on its priority. The system also included User file and Device independence. === Commands === The following list of commands are supported by TOPS-10. * ASSIGN * ATTACH * BACKSPACE * BACKUP * CCONTINUE * COMPILE * CONTINUE * COPY * CORE * CPUNCH * CREATE * CREDIR * CREF * CSTART * D(eposit) * DAYTIME * DCORE * DDT * DEASSIGN * DEBUG * DELETE * DETACH * DIRECTORY * DISABLE * DISMOUNT * DSK * DUMP * E(xamine) * EDIT * ENABLE * EOF * EXECUTE * FILCOM * FILE * FINISH * FUDGE * GET * GLOB * HALT * HELP * INITIA * JCONTINUE * KJOB * LABEL * LIST * LOAD * LOCATE * LOGIN * MAKE * MERGE * MIC * MOUNT * NETWORK * NODE * NSAVE * NSSAVE * OPSER * PJOB * PLEASE * PLOT * PRESERVE * PRINT * PROTECT * PUNCH * QUEUE * QUOLST * R * REASSIGN * REATTACH * REENTER * RENAME * RESOURCES * REWIND * RUN * SAVE * SSAVE * SCHED * SEND * SET * SKIP * START * SUBMIT * SYSTAT * TECO * TIME * TPUNCH * TYPE * UNLOAD * USESTAT * VERSION * WHERE * ZERO == History  Release history === The PDP-6 Monitor software was first released in 1964. Support for the PDP-10's KA10 processor was added to the Monitor in release 2.18 in 1967. The TOPS-10 name was first used in 1970 for release 5.01. Release 6.01 (May 1974) was the first TOPS-10 to implement virtual memory (demand paging), enabling programs larger than physical memory to be run. From release 7.00 onwards, symmetrical multiprocessing was available (as opposed to the master/slave arrangement used before). The final release of TOPS-10 was 7.04 in 1988. === TOPS-10 today === Hobbyists are now entitled to set up and use TOPS-10 under a Hobbyist's License. The easiest way for the hobbyist to run TOPS-10 is to acquire a suitable emulator and an operating system image. TOPS-10 may also be generated from archived original distribution \\"tapes\\". Paul Allen maintained several publicly accessible historic computer systems, including a DECsystem-2065 running TOPS-10. == Software  Implemented programming languages === The TOPS-10 assembler, MACRO-10, was bundled with the TOPS-10 distribution. The following programming languages were implemented on TOPS-10 as layered products: * ALGOL, as ALGOL-10 v10B, a compiler used for general computing * APL, as APL-SF V2, an interpreter used for mathematical modelling * BASIC, as BASIC-10 v17F, an interpreter used for general computing * BLISS, as BLISS-10 and BLISS-36, compilers used for systems programming * COBOL, as COBOL-68 and COBOL-74, compilers used for business computing * Fortran, as FORTRAN-10 v11, a compiler used for numerical computing The following programming languages were implemented on TOPS-10 as contributions from DECUS members: * FOCAL, as FOCAL-10 * Forth, a threaded interpreted language * IMP72 * Lisp, an interpreter used for AI programming * Pascal, a compiler used for computing education * PILOT * SAM76 * Simula, a compiler used for modeling * SNOBOL, an interpreter used for string processing * BCPL, a compiler implemented by Essex University === Implemented user utilities === The following major user utilities were implemented on TOPS-10: * RMS (Records Management Services) * IQL (Interactive Query language) * DBMS-10 (CODASYL Database Management System) === Notable games implemented on TOPS-10 === * ADVENT * DECWAR, as noted above * FORUM, as noted above * HAUNT, an early role-playing game * Mac Hack, a chess program by Richard Greenblatt * MUD == Legacy == MS-DOS was heavily influenced by TOPS-10.

The fewer ligands a protein can bind, the greater its specificity. Specificity describes the strength of binding between a given protein and ligand. This relationship can be described by a dissociation constant, which characterizes the balance between bound and unbound states for the protein-ligand system. In the context of a single enzyme and a pair of binding molecules, the two ligands can be compared as stronger or weaker ligands (for the enzyme) on the basis of their dissociation constants. (A lower value corresponds to a stronger binding.) Specificity for a set of ligands is unrelated to the ability of an enzyme to catalyze a given reaction, with the ligand as a substrate If a given enzyme has a high chemical specificity, this means that the set of ligands to which it binds is limited, such that neither binding events nor catalysis can occur at an appreciable rate with additional molecules. An example of a protein-ligand pair whose binding activity can be described as highly specific is the antibody-antigen system. Conversely, an example of a protein-ligand system that can bind substrates and catalyze multiple reactions effectively is the Cytochrome P450 system, which can be considered a promiscuous enzyme due to its broad specificity for multiple ligands. == Basis  Binding === The interactions between the protein and ligand substantially affect the specificity between the two entities. Electrostatic interactions and Hydrophobic interactions are known to be the most influential in regards to where specificity between two molecules is derived from. The strength of these interactions between the protein and ligand positively correlate with their specificity for one another. === Catalysis === Enzyme specificity refers to the interactions between any particular enzyme and its corresponding substrate. In addition to the specificity in binding its substrates, correct proximity and orientation as well as binding the transition state provide an additional layer of enzyme specificity. == Types == Enzymes vary in the specificity of the substrates that they bind to, in order to carry out specific physiological functions. Some enzymes may need to be less specific and therefore may bind to numerous substrates to catalyze a reaction. On the other hand, certain physiological functions require extreme specificity of the enzyme for a single specific substrate in order for a proper reaction and physiological phenotype to occur. The different types of categorizations differ based on their specificity for substrates. Most generally, they are divided into four groups: absolute, group, linkage, and stereochemical specificity. === Absolute specificity === Absolute specificity can be thought of as being exclusive, in which an enzyme acts upon one specific substrate. Absolute specific enzymes will only catalyze one reaction with its specific substrate. For example, lactase is an enzyme specific for the degradation of lactose into two sugar monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. Another example is Glucokinase, which is an enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. It is primarily active in the liver and is the main isozyme of Hexokinase. Its absolute specificity refers to glucose being the only hexose that is able to be its substrate, as opposed to hexokinase, which accommodates many hexoses as its substrate. === Group specificity === Group specificity occurs when an enzyme will only react with molecules that have specific functional groups, such as aromatic structures, phosphate groups, and methyls. One example is Pepsin, an enzyme that is crucial in digestion of foods ingested in our diet, that hydrolyzes peptide bonds in between hydrophobic amino acids, with recognition for aromatic side chains such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Another example is hexokinase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis that phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate. This enzyme exhibits group specificity by allowing multiple hexoses (6 carbon sugars) as its substrate. Glucose is one of the most important substrates in metabolic pathways involving hexokinase due to its role in glycolysis, but is not the only substrate that hexokinase can catalyze a reaction with. === Bond specificity === A reaction that illustrates an enzyme cleaving a specific bond of the reactant in order to create two productsBond specificity, unlike group specificity, recognizes particular chemical bond types. This differs from group specificity, as it is not reliant on the presence of particular functional groups in order to catalyze a particular reaction, but rather a certain bond type (for example, a peptide bond). === Stereochemical specificity === Sugars containing alpha-glycosidic linkages This type of specificity is sensitive to the substrate’s optical activity of orientation. Stereochemical molecules differ in the way in which they rotate plane polarized light, or orientations of linkages (see alpha, beta glycosidic linkages). Enzymes that are stereochemically specific will bind substrates with these particular properties. For example, beta-glycosidase will only react with beta-glycosidic bonds which are present in cellulose, but not present in starch and glycogen, which contain alpha-glycosidic linkages. This is relevant in how mammals are able to digest food. For instance, the enzyme Amylase is present in mammal saliva, that is stereo-specific for alpha- linkages, this is why mammals are able to efficiently use starch and glycogen as forms of energy, but not cellulose (because it is a beta-linkage). == Determination == kd, is known as the specific equilibrium dissociation constant for formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. kd is used as a measure of affinity, with higher values indicating a lower affinity. For the given equation (E = enzyme, S = substrate, P = product) k1 k2 E + S <\\\\--> ES <\\\\--> E + P k-1 kd would be equivalent to k-1/k1, where k1 and k-1 are the rates of the forward and backward reaction, respectively in the conversion of individual E and S to the enzyme substrate complex. === Application to enzyme kinetics === The chemical specificity of an enzyme for a particular substrate can be found using two variables that are derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation. km approximates the dissociation constant of enzyme-substrate complexes. kcat represents the turnover rate, or the number of reactions catalyzed by an enzyme over the enzyme amount. kcat over km is known as the specificity constant, which gives a measure of the affinity of a substrate to some particular enzyme. Also known as the efficiency of an enzyme, this relationship reveals an enzyme's preference for a particular substrate. The higher the specificity constant of an enzyme corresponds to a high preference for that substrate. == Significance  Medical research relevance === Enzymatic specificity provides useful insight into enzyme structure, which ultimately determines and plays a role in physiological functions. Specificity studies also may provide information of the catalytic mechanism. Specificity is important for novel drug discovery and the field of clinical research, with new drugs being tested for its specificity to the target molecule in various rounds of clinical trials. Drugs must contain as specific as possible structures in order to minimize the possibility of off-target affects that would produce unfavorable symptoms in the patient. Drugs depend on the specificity of the designed molecules and formulations to inhibit particular molecular targets. Novel drug discovery progresses with experiments involving highly specific compounds. For example, the basis that drugs must successfully be proven to accomplish is both the ability to bind the target receptor in the physiological environment with high specificity and also its ability to transduce a signal to produce a favorable biological effect against the sickness or disease that the drug is intended to negate. == Applications == Scientific techniques, such as immunostaining, depend on chemical specificity. Immunostaining utilizes the chemical specificity of antibodies in order to detect a protein of interest at the cellular level. Another technique that relies on chemical specificity is Western blotting, which is utilized to detect a certain protein of interest in a tissue. This technique involves gel electrophoresis followed by transferring of the sample onto a membrane which is stained by antibodies. Antibodies are specific to the target protein of interest, and will contain a fluorescent tag signaling the presence of the researcher's protein of interest. == See also == * Enzyme promiscuity * Substrate (chemistry) ==References== Category:Chemical bonding Category:Protein structure ","title":"Chemical specificity"},{"id":"529613","text":"Glucose binds to hexokinase in the active site at the beginning of glycolysis. In biochemistry and molecular biology, a binding site is a region on a macromolecule such as a protein that binds to another molecule with specificity. The binding partner of the macromolecule is often referred to as a ligand. Ligands may include other proteins (resulting in a protein-protein interaction), enzyme substrates, second messengers, hormones, or allosteric modulators. The binding event is often, but not always, accompanied by a conformational change that alters the protein's function. Binding to protein binding sites is most often reversible (transient and non-covalent), but can also be covalent reversible or irreversible. == Function == Binding of a ligand to a binding site on protein often triggers a change in conformation in the protein and results in altered cellular function. Hence binding site on protein are critical parts of signal transduction pathways. Types of ligands include neurotransmitters, toxins, neuropeptides, and steroid hormones. Binding sites incur functional changes in a number of contexts, including enzyme catalysis, molecular pathway signaling, homeostatic regulation, and physiological function. Electric charge, steric shape and geometry of the site selectively allow for highly specific ligands to bind, activating a particular cascade of cellular interactions the protein is responsible for. === Catalysis === Activation energy is decreased in the presence of an enzyme to catalyze the reaction. Enzymes incur catalysis by binding more strongly to transition states than substrates and products. At the catalytic binding site, several different interactions may act upon the substrate. These range from electric catalysis, acid and base catalysis, covalent catalysis, and metal ion catalysis. These interactions decrease the activation energy of a chemical reaction by providing favorable interactions to stabilize the high energy molecule. Enzyme binding allows for closer proximity and exclusion of substances irrelevant to the reaction. Side reactions are also discouraged by this specific binding. Types of enzymes that can perform these actions include oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases. For instance, the transferase hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to make glucose-6-phosphate. Active site residues of hexokinase allow for stabilization of the glucose molecule in the active site and spur the onset of an alternative pathway of favorable interactions, decreasing the activation energy. === Inhibition === Protein inhibition by inhibitor binding may induce obstruction in pathway regulation, homeostatic regulation and physiological function. Competitive inhibitors compete with substrate to bind to free enzymes at active sites and thus impede the production of the enzyme- substrate complex upon binding. For example, carbon monoxide poisoning is caused by the competitive binding of carbon monoxide as opposed to oxygen in hemoglobin. Uncompetitive inhibitors, alternatively, bind concurrently with substrate at active sites. Upon binding to an enzyme substrate (ES) complex, an enzyme substrate inhibitor (ESI) complex is formed. Similar to competitive inhibitors, the rate at product formation is decreased also. Lastly, mixed inhibitors are able to bind to both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. However, in contrast to competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors, mixed inhibitors bind to the allosteric site. Allosteric binding induces conformational changes that may increase the protein's affinity for substrate. This phenomenon is called positive modulation. Conversely, allosteric binding that decreases the protein's affinity for substrate is negative modulation. == Types  Active site === At the active site, a substrate binds to an enzyme to induce a chemical reaction. Substrates, transition states, and products can bind to the active site, as well as any competitive inhibitors. For example, in the context of protein function, the binding of calcium to troponin in muscle cells can induce a conformational change in troponin. This allows for tropomyosin to expose the actin-myosin binding site to which the myosin head binds to form a cross-bridge and induce a muscle contraction. In the context of the blood, an example of competitive binding is carbon monoxide which competes with oxygen for the active site on heme. Carbon monoxide's high affinity may outcompete oxygen in the presence of low oxygen concentration. In these circumstances, the binding of carbon monoxide induces a conformation change that discourages heme from binding to oxygen, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning. Competitive and noncompetitive enzyme binding at active and regulatory (allosteric) site respectively. ===Allosteric site=== At the regulatory site, the binding of a ligand may elicit amplified or inhibited protein function. The binding of a ligand to an allosteric site of a multimeric enzyme often induces positive cooperativity, that is the binding of one substrate induces a favorable conformation change and increases the enzyme's likelihood to bind to a second substrate. Regulatory site ligands can involve homotropic and heterotropic ligands, in which single or multiple types of molecule affects enzyme activity respectively. Enzymes that are highly regulated are often essential in metabolic pathways. For example, phosphofructokinase (PFK), which phosphorylates fructose in glycolysis, is largely regulated by ATP. Its regulation in glycolysis is imperative because it is the committing and rate limiting step of the pathway. PFK also controls the amount of glucose designated to form ATP through the catabolic pathway. Therefore, at sufficient levels of ATP, PFK is allosterically inhibited by ATP. This regulation efficiently conserves glucose reserves, which may be needed for other pathways. Citrate, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, also works as an allosteric regulator of PFK. ===Single- and multi-chain binding sites=== Binding sites can be characterized also by their structural features. Single-chain sites (of “monodesmic” ligands, μόνος: single, δεσμός: binding) are formed by a single protein chain, while multi-chain sites (of \\"polydesmic” ligands, πολοί: many) are frequent in protein complexes, and are formed by ligands that bind more than one protein chain, typically in or near protein interfaces. Recent research shows that binding site structure has profound consequences for the biology of protein complexes (evolution of function, allostery). == Binding curves == Sigmoidal versus hyperbolic binding patterns demonstrate cooperative and noncooperative character of enzymes. Binding curves describe the binding behavior of ligand to a protein. Curves can be characterized by their shape, sigmoidal or hyperbolic, which reflect whether or not the protein exhibits cooperative or noncooperative binding behavior respectively. Typically, the x-axis describes the concentration of ligand and the y-axis describes the fractional saturation of ligands bound to all available binding sites. The Michaelis Menten equation is usually used when determining the shape of the curve. The Michaelis Menten equation is derived based on steady-state conditions and accounts for the enzyme reactions taking place in a solution. However, when the reaction takes place while the enzyme is bound to a substrate, the kinetics play out differently. Modeling with binding curves are useful when evaluating the binding affinities of oxygen to hemoglobin and myoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin, which has four heme groups, exhibits cooperative binding. This means that the binding of oxygen to a heme group on hemoglobin induces a favorable conformation change that allows for increased binding favorability of oxygen for the next heme groups. In these circumstances, the binding curve of hemoglobin will be sigmoidal due to its increased binding favorability for oxygen. Since myoglobin has only one heme group, it exhibits noncooperative binding which is hyperbolic on a binding curve. == Applications == Biochemical differences between different organisms and humans are useful for drug development. For instance, penicillin kills bacterial enzymes by inhibiting DD-transpeptidase, destroying the development of the bacterial cell wall and inducing cell death. Thus, the study of binding sites is relevant to many fields of research, including cancer mechanisms, drug formulation, and physiological regulation. The formulation of an inhibitor to mute a protein's function is a common form of pharmaceutical therapy. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase by outcompeting the substrate folic acid. Binding site in blue, inhibitor in green, and substrate in black. In the scope of cancer, ligands that are edited to have a similar appearance to the natural ligand are used to inhibit tumor growth. For example, Methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic, acts as a competitive inhibitor at the dihydrofolate reductase active site. This interaction inhibits the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, shutting off production of DNA, RNA and proteins. Inhibition of this function represses neoplastic growth and improves severe psoriasis and adult rheumatoid arthritis. In cardiovascular illnesses, drugs such as beta blockers are used to treat patients with hypertension. Beta blockers (β-Blockers) are antihypertensive agents that block the binding of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline to β1 and β2 receptors in the heart and blood vessels. These receptors normally mediate the sympathetic \\"fight or flight\\" response, causing constriction of the blood vessels. Competitive inhibitors are also largely found commercially. Botulinum toxin, known commercially as Botox, is a neurotoxin causes flaccid paralysis in the muscle due to binding to acetylcholine dependent nerves. This interaction inhibits muscle contractions, giving the appearance of smooth muscle. == Prediction == A number of computational tools have been developed for the prediction of the location of binding sites on proteins. These can be broadly classified into sequence based or structure based. Sequence based methods rely on the assumption that the sequences of functionally conserved portions of proteins such as binding site are conserved. Structure based methods require the 3D structure of the protein. These methods in turn can be subdivided into template and pocket based methods. Template based methods search for 3D similarities between the target protein and proteins with known binding sites. The pocket based methods search for concave surfaces or buried pockets in the target protein that possess features such as hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding capacity that would allow them to bind ligands with high affinity. Even though the term pocket is used here, similar methods can be used to predict binding sites used in protein-protein interactions that are usually more planar, not in pockets. == References == == External links == * *Drawing the active site of an enzyme Category:Chemical bonding Category:Structural biology Category:Protein structure ","title":"Binding site"},{"id":"529614","text":"Sabriel is a fantasy novel by Garth Nix, first published in 1995. It is the first in his Old Kingdom series, followed by Lirael, Abhorsen, Clariel and Goldenhand. ==Plot introduction== The novel is set in two neighbouring fictional countries: To the South lies Ancelstierre, which has a technology level and society similar to that of early-20th century Australia, and to the North lies the Old Kingdom, where both Free magic and Charter Magic exist—a fact officially denied by the government of Ancelstierre and disbelieved by most of Ancelstierre's inhabitants. A wall separates the two countries. Near the border some magic crosses the Wall, especially on days when the wind is blowing out of the Old Kingdom. Since the fall of the Royal Family, dangerous entities roam, ranging from the undead to powerful sorcerers and Free Magic elementals. These living Dead are raised by Necromancers, diviners of the dead who roam the Old Kingdom or live in Death, using Hands to do their bidding. To remedy the problem of dangerous living dead, a necromancer under the title of Abhorsen uses a bandolier of Bells and a sword to put the dead to rest. At the time of Sabriel, it is her father Terciel who has the job of putting the dead to rest in the Old Kingdom, especially difficult since a new evil is rising. When the current Abhorsen is overcome by one such evil and beyond the Seventh Gate, he sends his bells (the primary tools of a necromancer and used in various ways to control the Dead) and sword to his daughter Sabriel via an undead messenger bound and under his control. Sabriel is at an Ancelstierre school for girls to remain out of reach of those who might try to strike at her father through her and end the Abhorsen bloodline. The bound undead is also attempting to speak, but she must enter death in order to make out the words. She is instructed by her father (speaking through the undead messenger in Death) to return to the Old Kingdom to take on the role of Abhorsen and stop Kerrigor's return to Life. While in Death obtaining her father's guidance, she narrowly avoids a fatal altercation with a Lesser Dead. ==Plot summary== The book opens with Sabriel raising a freshly killed rabbit from death. She is a young girl attending Wyverly College, an all-female boarding school in Ancelstierre. An undead creature enters the dormitory where Sabriel lives and frightens all of the girls. Sabriel, however, notices it is holding a satchel and is attempting to speak. She enters Death to see what it is and notices strings attached to it passing over the waterfall of the First Gate; a sign that the creature is under the control of a necromancer further in Death. It is very weak, but Sabriel makes out that it is a messenger bound by her father who is past the Seventh Gate of Death. She is instructed by her father (through the messenger) that she is to take on the role of Abhorsen and defeat Kerrigor (a powerful Free Magic necromancer) who is attempting to make his way back into Life to break the Charter which binds the Free Magic and thus destroy the Charter of the Old Kingdom. She retrieves the satchel which contains the Abhorsen's bandelier of bells, the Abhorsen's sword and a map of the Old Kingdom. Having left her school, Sabriel crosses the Wall using papers given to her by her father. Her destination is Abhorsen's House, the home of her father. Near the wall, she meets a southern colonel and his troops. The soldiers are using brute force to stop hordes of Shadow Hands from dismantling the Wall and crossing over. The areas near the Wall are being evacuated and only those who are inhabitants of the Old Kingdom are allowed the cross. As she continues her journey, Sabriel becomes aware that she is being stalked by a Mordicant, a powerful Dead creature. She is able to outrun the creature and reach the safety of Abhorsen's House, which is located on an island in the center of the river. (The Dead cannot cross fast and deep running water.) Inside Abhorsen's house, Sabriel is able to rest and obtain food and other supplies, as well as armor. She also meets Mogget, a Free Magic construct who takes the form of a small white cat, wearing a collar with a powerful binding spell on it and a miniature Saraneth hanging from it. Mogget insists on accompanying her on her journey to find her father. Later, they look out over the walls surrounding the house and discover the Dead attempting to build a bridge. Sabriel performs a ritual to summon a flood of water and then flees the house by Paperwing (a magically propelled plane-like structure.) While in the air, Sabriel and Mogget are attacked by the Dead, and Sabriel loosens Mogget's collar to avoid a fatal crash. They fall into a sinkhole, where Mogget, in his unbound form, attempts to murder Sabriel. However, she is able to bind him anew with a ring given to her for that purpose. The next day, Sabriel and Mogget walk through a tunnel to another sinkhole, which Mogget determines to be Holehallow, the historical burial place of the royal family. Each king is buried in a boat. Sabriel discovers that the figurehead on one of the boats is not a wooden carving but an actual man, who has been imprisoned in that form for two hundred years. The man tells Sabriel that he was a Royal Guard before his imprisonment, and asks to be called Touchstone (a jester's name) for reasons that remain cryptic. Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget continue their journey, stopping to help rid a seaside village of a Dead creature. They obtain a boat there and sail up the coast of the Old Kingdom until they reach Belisaere, the capital. They find the Abhorsen in an underground reservoir in Belisaere, trapped in Death. Since he has stayed too long in Death, he cannot return for long, but with what little time he has left, the Abhorsen tells Sabriel about the evil known as Kerrigor. Kerrigor has risen far from Death and intends to wreak havoc in the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. Sabriel releases her father from Death, and once they emerge from Death, father and daughter part for the last time — he, to ring the bell Astarael (the sound of which throws everyone who hears it far into the realm of Death) and delay Kerrigor's havoc; and she, to save Touchstone by bringing him (and herself) as far away from Astarael's music as possible. To prevent him from losing to Death, she kisses him roughly in order to keep him focused on Life. In the process of ringing Astarael, Sabriel's father releases Mogget. They succeed, but as long as Kerrigor's body is intact, he will rise from Death again and again. Sabriel and Touchstone use another Paperwing to bring them as close to the Wall as possible, and cross over to Ancelstierre to find Kerrigor's body, following the clairvoyant guidance of the Clayr twins Sanar and Ryelle. They find the body, and Sabriel finally defeats Kerrigor by binding him with Ranna and Mogget's collar. She dies but the previous Abhorsens prevent her from crossing into Final Death as she cannot die without someone else to take her place as Abhorsen. She wakes up with Touchstone before her, and both Mogget and Kerrigor asleep, bound by Ranna (the first of seven necromantic bells that instills sleep and quiescence in those who hear it). ==Important characters and magical entitiesThe Bloodlines=== Thousands of years ago, seven of the Nine Bright Shiners sacrificed their powers to create the Charter: a combination of powerful objects (the Great Stones and the Wall) and three magic blood lines, known as the Abhorsen, the Clayr and the Royal Family. Five of the Seven completely lost themselves (one in each object or blood line) while two remained somewhat independent. One invested his/her power in the Royal bloodline, one in the Abhorsen's and one in the Clayr's (which is why the Clayr greet Sabriel as \\"cousin\\"). The remaining two, known as the \\"Wallmakers\\" invested themselves in several objects of power, including the Stones and Wall, then disappeared. These artifacts, the Charter Stones, are sources of the web of Charter magic that maintains peace and order over the kingdom. The Bloodlines all have a higher concentration of strong Charter mages than the general populace. The Abhorsens One of the most respected figures in the Old Kingdom, the Abhorsen uses both the dangerous Free Magic-based powers of a necromancer and the benevolent magic of the Charter to keep the gates of Death against the return of Dead spirits back into Life. Sabriel and her father are members of the Abhorsen family. They use the bells, named after the seven bright shiners that established the old kingdom, in tandem with their natural affinity with Death, granted by their ancestor bright shiner, to amplify their powers. The bells, smallest to largest, are Ranna, Mosrael, Kibeth, Dyrim, Belgaer, Saraneth, and Astarael. Saraneth, the \\"binder\\", is thought to be the original Abhorsen, and the bright shiner who invested her powers in this bloodline. Her gift is \\"binding\\", just as the Abhorsens job is to \\"bind\\" the dead to Death. Ranna the \\"sleepbringer\\", causing listeners to fall asleep; she is the least tricksome. Mosrael, \\"the waker\\", wakes the dead, bringing them into life as it throws the necromancer farther into death. Kibeth, \\"walker\\", forces the dead to march back into death, or wherever the ringer desires, although if the ringer is not careful it may end up \\"walking\\" her. Dyrim is the \\"speaker\\", granting the ability of speech to the dead, or taking it away. Belgaer is the \\"thinker\\" and can restore independent thought to the dead and resurrect old memories, but can also erase them in a careless hand. Astarael is the \\"Sorrowful\\". Last and final of the bells, she sends all who hear her, including the ringer, deep into death. It is nearly impossible to return after hearing Astarael. Like all three bloodlines, the Abhorsen bloodline not only defines their job (the Abhorsen may only be chosen from direct blood relatives) and grants them their powers, but also determines their appearance. All members of the Abhorsen family have black hair and their skin is unnaturally pale. Among the families guarding the Old Kingdom from disaster, and the only family guarding it from disasters from Death, Abhorsens are unique in their ability to sense Death. They are able to identify undead creatures and differentiate them from the living, and cross over into Death to fight undead minions there and banish them to a final death. They are also the only ones who have the proper authority to enter Death, and therefore the only Necromancers who retain uncorrupted charter marks and mage powers. Their symbol is a silver key on a background of blue. The Royal Family For centuries, the royalty justly ruled the Old Kingdom from their palace at the capital Belisaere as powerful upholders of the peace, until their fall by the hands of Kerrigor, or Prince Rogirek nicknamed Rogir, a rogue member of the royal family who killed his sisters and mother to use their blood to break the Great Charter Stones. The Kingdom now suffers from their 200-year absence. Unlike the Abhorsens, the Royalty cannot cross into Death at will and do not usually use Free Magic. Their specialty lies in diplomacy and Charter magic. They are connected to the Clayr and Abhorsens in that they're a Great Charter. It is thought they are descended from Dyrim, the \\"speaker\\", because of their skill in diplomacy. Their symbol is a golden tower on a sea of red. The Clayr The largest family among the magical bloodlines, the Clayr are arbiters of justice and foresight who see all from their glacier in the northernmost parts of the Old Kingdom. The Clayr are a family of seers who may, when there is need, pool their powers together to see clear visions of the future, while individually they see only splinters. The Clayr also possess abilities in Charter Magic, but to a lesser extent than the Abhorsen or Royal family lines. They are descended from Mosrael, the \\"waker\\". The Clayr celebrate the young's \\"awakening\\" of their sight when they receive their first vision. Like the Abhorsen, the Clayr have a strong family resemblance. All daughters of the Clayr (they have few sons), excluding Remembrancers, have brown skin and blonde, almost white, hair. The Glacier of the Clayr is home to a great library, as well, which is a repository of magic and history, and is even used as \\"cold storage\\" for particularly dangerous, but immortal, creatures. Their symbol is a seven pointed star. The Wallmakers The Wallmakers were the builders of the Wall that divides the Old Kingdom from Ancelstriere and creators of the Charter Stones; A Charter Magic bloodline particularly skilled in the creation of magical objects. They created the weaponry of the Royal Family (such as the twin swords wielded by Touchstone), the ceramic, nearly impervious armor known as Gethre owned by the Abhorsens, the Abhorsen's sword, and other powerful Charter Magic objects and weapons possessed by the Clayr. It can be deduced that they were the last 2 bright shiners, Ranna and Belgaer. They invested all of their power in their creations, thus leaving no bloodline. Therefore, for the majority of the books, it is apparent that the Wallmakers are 'extinct' and no longer exist. By the end of Lirael and for the whole of Abhorsen, we find out that the Wallmaker bloodline has been reconstituted in Prince Sameth, explaining his uncanny ability to create magical \\"toys\\" and enchant weaponry, which otherwise would 'take months' to do. The line was probably brought back for the sole purpose of defeating Orannis. The symbol of the Wallmaker is a silver trowel or spade. The Dead And Free Magic Creatures The Greater Dead: The souls of dead necromancers who have used their dark knowledge to rise from Death. These creatures are the strongest of the Dead and with their necromantic powers they can raise and command the lesser dead. The most powerful of the Greater Dead is Kerrigor, who is the only undead creature to retain his full potential for Free magic after death. Sabriel implies that the true home of the greater dead is beyond the Seventh Gate of Death. The Lesser Dead: The collective name for all dead spirits which lack the knowledge and power it takes to become one of the greater dead. Most lesser dead are the souls after ordinary mortals who refused to accept death. They often died under unfortunate circumstances, like Thralk who died in a hunting accident. It is also implied that powerful undead can enslave unwilling souls and force them to become lesser dead. Sabriel fears this fate when she is running from the Mordicant. Mordicant: A powerful Lesser Dead Free Magic creature which can easily pass through the Gates of Death and into Life where it has a strong hold. It is created by a necromancer by molding bog-clay and human blood, infusing it with Free Magic, and placing a Dead spirit inside. It is described as man-like, with eyes like fire, and grey-green flesh that drips with flames and smoke. Sabriel defeated a weak Mordicant when she was fourteen years old. However, a very strong one stalked Sabriel on her journey from Ancelstierre to the Abhorsen's House. As Sabriel drew closer to the Door in the Long Cliffs leading to the Abhorsen's House, it gave chase, but Sabriel made it to the door and through a passageway due to its Charter Magic Guard which momentarily held off the Mordicant. The Abhorsen's bridge leading to the house stopped the Mordicant as the undead cannot cross fast and deep running water. The Mordicant then led a siege using Shadow hands and living human slaves who worked non-stop for days to fill the river with earth to allow him to cross. To end the siege, Sabriel called on the Clayr's gift of water bringing forth a massive wave to wipe the Mordicant and his slaves away. Thralk: A dead spirit that slipped out of Death after the commotion Kerrigor caused in breaking through all the gates single-handedly. It stayed in Life for decades, feeding off humans. It found Sabriel in Life on Cloven Crest while she was in Death, though surrounded by a diamond of protection. Sabriel sensed when the creature broke through her protection, and banished it to death with the Abhorsen's sword and the bell Kibeth. Thralk died 300 years before when a hunting spear rebounded off a rock and cut his throat. Shadow Hands: Dead creatures controlled and created by a necromancer. Usually a skilled necromancer uses the heads of dead humans to bring back only their spirits, forming an incorporeal, and dark shadow that only has a pair of hands and does the bidding of the necromancer. Shadow Hands are difficult to destroy by mere force, but can be easily put to rest by the bells of the Abhorsen. Sabriel suspected a necromancer of having formed Shadow Hands from the soldiers close to Cloven Crest. They attacked Wyverly College after the Dead Hands made it past the soldiers and while Sabriel was attempting to destroy Rogirrek (Rogir)/Kerrigor's body. Mordaut: One of the weaker Dead creatures; a parasite. It cohabits a human body, controlling and hiding in it, and slowly saps the life from it in order to avoid Death. Once it has nearly consumed the soul of the host, it comes out at night and takes the life of any other human around it. It has no definite form and moves like a pool of darkness from host to host. Sabriel encountered a Mordaut on the tiny rocky islet of Nestowe, inhabiting the body of a fisherman named Patar. Once she had sensed it and was putting it to sleep with Ranna, the Mordaut killed Patar by sucking all the life out of him instantly. Sabriel stabbed it with her sword and sent it deep into Death using the bells Saraneth (the Binder), Ranna (the Sleepbringer), and Kibeth (the Walker). Gore Crows: Ordinary crows trapped, killed with a ritual, and infused with a single human spirit by a necromancer. They disintegrate in the sun, are torn apart by wind, and decay over time, but they can fly over running water. They are strongest when freshly killed, infused with a strong spirit, and are great in numbers. They seemingly fly without the use of wings or plumage as they are suspended by the Free Magic which was used to create them. A flock of gore crows attacks Sabriel when she is flying in the Paperwing after escaping from Abhorsen's house. ==Characters in Sabriel== * Sabriel -- Title character. 53rd Abhorsen. She is 18 and finishing her last year at Wyverly College at the start of the novel. * Mogget -- an ancient Free Magic construct of unknown origin; appears in the form of a white cat and is bound by a red Charter magic collar to serve the Abhorsen. * Touchstone -- a bastard prince, son of a former Queen and a nobleman, and is the only remaining heir of the Royal Blood. He was trapped as the wooden figurehead of a ceremonial boat for two hundred years by the Abhorsen of that time in order to save him (and his Blood) from death. He is also Sabriel's growing love interest as the story progresses. * Kerrigor -- Formerly known as Rogir, or Rogirrek. A Greater Dead adept in Free Magic necromancy, former member of the Royal Family, and who is at odds with the Charter. Powerful Spells of past Abhorsens bound him to Death and his body was buried in Ancelstierre beyond the Wall where magic was not present; but during Sabriel's father's time, he has awoken and once again trying to destroy the Charter which binds Free Magic. The name Kerrigor, as is revealed by Touchstone, was a childhood nickname, made up by the royal prince himself. It is derived from his full ceremonial name, Rogirek. * Terciel (known as \\"Abhorsen\\") -- Sabriel's father, Abhorsen before Sabriel. Revived his daughter after she died at birth. He was unable to save his wife, who died during child birth. Although he rarely visited her physically while she was at school, he would often visit her through sendings of himself in the fireplace at the dark of the moon each month. ==Major themes== This book deals with the loss of family (Sabriel's and Touchstone's) and coming to terms with oneself and one's responsibilities. Abhorsen's final words to Sabriel, \\"Everyone and everything has a time to die,\\" refer to the idea of sacrifice. Another theme is that of destiny. Both the Book of the Dead and Sabriel's almanac contain the lines: Does the Walker choose the Path, or the Path the Walker? Death is not considered a bad thing as such, and loss is shown to be something that builds character. ==Awards== Sabriel won the Aurealis Award for best young-adult novel and best fantasy novel in 1995. It is also an ALA Notable Book and was a short-list nominee for the 1996 Ditmar Award for best long fiction. ==Film== According to Publishing News, Garth Nix was preparing to pitch a Sabriel film to studios in mid-2008 via Steve Fisher at APA. Nix co-wrote the screenplay with Dan Futterman, actor and Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Capote, and Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner at Plan B Entertainment were to produce. The director would be Anand Tucker. Planning for the pitch was delayed by the writer's strike, and resumed in February. While the current status of any film is unknown, Nix is now represented by Matthew Snyder at CAA. ==References== ==External links== Category:1995 Australian novels Category:Old Kingdom series books Category:Aurealis Award-winning works Category:Australian fantasy novels Category:Australian young adult novels Category:Novels by Garth Nix Category:Fictional undead Category:1995 fantasy novels Category:Books with cover art by Leo and Diane Dillon ","title":"Sabriel"},{"id":"529627","text":"Brewster Hopkinson Shaw Jr. (born May 16, 1945) is a former NASA astronaut, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel and former executive at Boeing.

He served as an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School from August 1977 to July 1978. ==NASA career== Shaw was selected by NASA to be an astronaut in January 1978 where he served on loan from the Air Force. ===Space flight experience=== STS-9 Shaw's first trip to space was as pilot on STS-9 Columbia from November 28 to December 8, 1983. His fellow crew included Commander John W. Young, mission specialists Owen Garriott and Robert Parker, and payload specialists, Byron Lichtenberg and Ulf Merbold. This was the largest crew to fly aboard a single spacecraft, the first international Shuttle crew and the first to carry payload specialists. The crew conducted more than seventy multi-disciplinary scientific and technical investigations in the fields of life sciences, atmospheric physics and earth observations, astronomy and solar physics, space plasma physics, and materials processing. After ten days of spacelab hardware verification and around-the-clock scientific operations, Columbia and its laboratory cargo (the heaviest payload to be returned to earth in the shuttle's cargo bay) returned to land on the dry lake bed at Edwards Air Force Base, California. STS-61B Brewster Shaw first served as shuttle commander on STS-61B Atlantis. The mission launched at night on November 26 and returned on December 3, 1985. The crew included spacecraft commander Brewster Shaw; pilot, Bryan O'Connor; mission specialists, Mary Cleave, Jerry Ross, and Woody Spring; as well as payload specialists Rodolfo Neri Vela (Mexico), and Charles Walker (McDonnell Douglas). During the mission the crew deployed the communications satellites, conducted two six-hour spacewalks to demonstrate space station construction techniques with the EASE/ACCESS experiments, operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis (CRFES) experiment for McDonnell Douglas and a Getaway Special (GAS) container for Telesat, Canada, conducted several Mexican Payload Specialists Experiments for the Mexican Government and tested the Orbiter Experiments Digital Autopilot (OEX DAP). This was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the space shuttle to date. After completing 108 orbits of the Earth in 165 hours, Shaw landed Atlantis on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. STS-28 Shaw was the commander of STS-28 Columbia (August 8–13, 1989). The mission included pilot Dick Richards and three mission specialists: Jim Adamson, Dave Leestma and Mark Brown. The shuttle carried classified Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of the earth, this five-day mission concluded with a dry lake bed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. ===NASA Management=== Shaw left the Johnson Space Center in October 1989 to assume the NASA Headquarters senior executive position of Deputy Director, Space Shuttle Operations, located at the Kennedy Space Center. As operations manager, Shaw was responsible for all operational aspects of the Space Shuttle Program and had Level II authority over the Space Shuttle elements from the time the Orbiters left the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF), were mated to the external tank and solid rocket boosters, transported to the launch pad, launched and recovered and returned to the Orbiter Processing Facility. He was the final authority for the launch decision, and chaired the Mission Management Team. Shaw moved on to serve as the Deputy Program Manager, Space Shuttle, as a NASA Headquarters employee located at the Kennedy Space Center. In addition to the duties he previously held, he also shared with the Space Shuttle Program Manager, full authority and responsibility for the conduct of the Space Shuttle Program. He then served as Director, Space Shuttle Operations, with responsibility for the development of all Space Shuttle elements, including the Orbiter, external tank, solid rocket boosters, Space Shuttle main engines, the facilities required to support mission operations and in the planning necessary to efficiently conduct Space Shuttle operations. ==Aerospace executiveRockwell and Boeing=== Shaw joined Rockwell in 1996 after 27 years with the U.S. Air Force and NASA.

After serving in the United States Navy, Garriott was an engineering professor at Stanford University before attending the United States Air Force Pilot Training Program and later joining NASA. After his NASA career, he worked for various aerospace companies, consulted on NASA-related committees, taught as an adjunct professor, and conducted research on microbes found in extreme environments. ==Early life== Owen Kay Garriott was born in Enid, Oklahoma, on November 22, 1930, to Owen and Mary Catherine Garriott (). Owen's middle name was based on his mother's middle name. He was a Boy Scout (earning the rank of Star Scout), and graduated from Enid High School in 1948, where he served as senior class president and was voted \\"Most Likely To Succeed.\\" He received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1953, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He was also the elected president of the senior class. He later earned Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University in electrical engineering in 1957 and 1960, respectively. == Career  U.S. military === Garriott served as electronics officer in the United States Navy from 1953 to 1956. From 1961 through 1965, he was an assistant professor and associate professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University. He performed research and led graduate studies in ionospheric physics after obtaining his doctorate, and authored or co-authored more than 45 scientific papers, chapters and one book, principally in areas of the physical sciences. As a prerequisite of the era's scientist-astronaut training, he completed a one-year United States Air Force pilot training program in 1966, receiving qualification as pilot in jet aircraft. ===NASA=== spacewalk during the Skylab 3 mission. In 1965, Garriott was one of the six scientist-astronauts selected by NASA. His first spaceflight, the Skylab 3 mission in 1973, set a world record for duration of approximately 60 days, more than double the previous record. Extensive experiments were conducted of the Sun, of Earth resources and in various life sciences relating to human adaptation to weightlessness. His second space flight was aboard STS-9 (Spacelab-1) in 1983, a multidisciplinary and international mission of 10 days aboard Space Shuttle Columbia. Over 70 separate experiments in six different disciplines were conducted, primarily to demonstrate the suitability of Spacelab for research in all these areas. He operated the world's first amateur radio station from space, W5LFL, which expanded into an important activity on dozens of shuttle flights, Space Station Mir and the International Space Station, with scores of astronauts and cosmonauts participating. Between these missions, Garriott received a NASA fellowship in the Space Station Project Office. In this position, he worked closely with the external scientific communities and advised the project manager concerning the scientific suitability of the space station design. Garriott held the distinction of being the NASA astronaut with the earliest- obtained PhD degree, having earned his PhD from Stanford University in 1960, two years before Robert A. Parker who obtained his PhD from Caltech in 1962. ===The Skylab \\"stowaway\\" prank=== On September 10, 1973, controllers in Houston were startled to hear a woman's voice beaming down from Skylab. The voice startled capsule communicator (CAPCOM) Bob Crippen by calling him by name, and then the woman explained: \\"The boys haven't had a home-cooked meal in so long I thought I'd bring one up.\\" After several minutes in which she described forest fires seen from space and the beautiful sunrise, the woman said: \\"Oh oh. I have to cut off now. I think the boys are floating up here toward the command module and I'm not supposed to be talking to you.\\" As the Skylab astronauts later revealed, Garriott had recorded his wife, Helen, during a private radio transmission the night before.Skylab, Our First Space Station – Leland F. Belew, Scientific Technical Information Office National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1977, page 118 ===Post-NASA career=== After leaving NASA in June 1986, Garriott consulted for various aerospace companies and served as a member of several NASA and National Research Council Committees. From January 1988 until May 1993, he was vice president of space programs at Teledyne Brown Engineering. This division, which grew to over 1,000 people, provided payload integration for all Spacelab projects at the Marshall Space Flight Center and had a substantial role in the development of the U.S. laboratory for the International Space Station. Garriott devoted time to several charitable activities in his hometown, including the Enid Arts and Sciences Foundation of which he was a co-founder in 1992. Later, he accepted a position as adjunct professor in the Laboratory for Structural Biology at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and participated in research activities there involving new microbes he returned from extreme environments such as very alkaline lakes and deep sea hydrothermal vents. Hyperthermophiles were returned from several dives in Russian MIR submersibles to the Rainbow Vent Field at a depth of 2,300 meters near the Azores in the central Atlantic Ocean. Other research activities included three trips to Antarctica from which 20 meteorites were returned for laboratory study. Garriott formed a 501(c)(3) public philanthropic Garriott Family Foundation to finance the aforementioned adventure travel for himself, his wife and other members of his family. == Personal life and death == Owen with Richard, prior to his son's spaceflight Garriott married Helen Mary Walker, his high school sweetheart, in 1952. They had four children: Randall O. (born 1955), Robert K. (born 1956), Richard A. (born 1961, a computer programmer and the creator of the Ultima computer game series), and Linda S. (born 1966). After he divorced his first wife, Garriott married Evelyn L. Garriott, who had three children from a previous relationship. His son Richard was launched as a space tourist on board Soyuz TMA-13 on October 12, 2008, the first American and the second person worldwide to follow a parent into space. Owen Garriott was in mission control at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for the launch and was in attendance when his son returned 12 days later. Garriott died on April 15, 2019, at his home in Huntsville, Alabama. ==Organizations== Garriott was a member of the following organizations: American Astronautical Society (fellow), American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (associate fellow), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, American Geophysical Union, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Association of Space Explorers (Board of Directors), Astronaut Scholarship Foundation (vice president and vice chairman).

The intense early-season \\"panhandle hook\\" winter storm cut a 1,000-mile-wide (1600 km) swath through the middle of the country from Kansas to Michigan. ==Meteorological synopsis== On November 7, 1940, the low pressure system that later developed into the storm was affecting the Pacific Northwest and produced the winds that destroyed the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. On November 10 the fast-moving storm crossed the Rocky Mountains in just two hours on its way to the Midwest. The morning of November 11, 1940, brought with it unseasonably high temperatures in the Upper Midwest. By early afternoon, temperatures approached over most of the affected region. However, as the day wore on conditions quickly deteriorated. Severe weather was reported across much of the Midwest with heavy rain and snow, a tornado, and gale-force winds were all reported. Temperatures dropped sharply, winds picked up and rain, followed by sleet and then snow, began to fall. An intense low pressure system had tracked from the southern plains northeastward into western Wisconsin, pulling Gulf of Mexico moisture up from the South and pulling down a cold arctic air mass from the North. The result was a raging blizzard that would last into the next day. Snowfalls of up to , winds of , snow drifts, and temperature drops were common over parts of the states of Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. In Minnesota, of snow fell at Collegeville, and the Twin Cities recorded . Record low pressures were recorded in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. Transportation and communications were crippled, which made finding the dead and injured more difficult. The Armistice Day Blizzard ranks #2 in Minnesota's list of the top five weather events of the 20th century. Survivors describe the cold as so severe that it was difficult to breathe, with the air so moisture laden it was thick like syrup and that the cold seared the survivors lungs like a red-hot blade. Many individuals claim that animals were aware of the upcoming weather shifts which led to animals moving rapidly from the area. Duck hunters who were out at the time were amazed at the amount of ducks that were in the area and on the move through the skies, one survivor recounting there were thousands. ==Casualties== A total of 146 deaths were blamed on the storm, with the following instances being noteworthy: *Along the Mississippi River several hundred duck hunters had taken time off from work and school to take advantage of the ideal hunting conditions. Weather forecasters had not predicted the severity of the oncoming storm, and as a result many of the hunters were not dressed for cold weather. When the storm began many hunters took shelter on small islands in the Mississippi River, and the 50 mph (80 km/h) winds and 5-foot (1.5 m) waves overcame their encampments. Some became stranded on the islands and then froze to death in the single-digit (°F) temperatures that moved in over night. Others tried to make it to shore and drowned. Duck hunters constituted about half of the 49 deaths in Minnesota. Those who survived told of how ducks came south with the storm by the thousands, and everybody could have shot their daily limit had they not been focused on survival. *Casualties were lessened by the efforts of Max Conrad, a pioneering light plane pilot and flight school owner and John R. \\"Bob\\" Bean (one of the flight school instructors) both based in Winona, Minnesota, 25 miles upriver from La Crosse. They flew up and down the river in the wake of the storm, locating survivors and dropping supplies to them. Both men were nominated for the Carnegie Medal for their heroism. *One survivor, Gerald Tarras, survived the storm in Minneapolis due to the two family Labrador dogs who lay beside him and provided body heat to protect him. *In Watkins, Minnesota, 2 people died when a passenger train and a freight train collided in the blinding snow. Watkins residents formed a human chain to lead the passengers to safety. *In Lake Michigan, 66 sailors died in the sinking of three freighters, the SS Anna C. Minch, the SS Novadoc, and the SS William B. Davock, and two smaller boats. *13 people died in Illinois, 13 in Wisconsin, and 4 in Michigan. Additionally, 1.5 million turkeys intended for Thanksgiving dinner across Minnesota perished from exposure to the cold conditions. ==Aftermath== Prior to this event, all of the weather forecasts for the region originated in Chicago. After the failure to provide an accurate forecast for this blizzard, forecasting responsibilities were expanded to include 24-hour coverage and more forecasting offices were created, yielding more accurate local forecasts. The U.S. Weather Bureau was criticized that it failed to predict the huge blizzard and officials released a statement that they were aware that the storm was coming but wrong about its strength and scope. The Twin Cities (Minneapolis/St. Paul) branch of Meteorology was upgraded to issue forecasts and not rely on the Chicago site. ==See also== *Climate of Minnesota *Collapse of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, an infamous bridge collapse caused by the same low pressure system several days prior ==References== ==External links== *Armistice Day Blizzard *Yesterday's news: Storm paralyzes Minnesota *Armistice Day Blizzard of 1940, a podcast by the Minnesota Historical Society on the storm and subsequent changes to the National Weather Service's forecasting practices. 1940-11 Category:1940 meteorology Category:1940 natural disasters in the United States Category:Natural disasters in Minnesota Category:Natural disasters in Wisconsin Category:1940 in Minnesota Category:1940 in Wisconsin Category:November 1940 events ","title":"1940 Armistice Day Blizzard"},{"id":"529647","text":"Robert Parker may refer to: *Sir Robert Parker, 1st Baronet (c. 1655–1691), English politician; Member of Parliament for Hastings, 1679–1685 *Robert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington (1857–1918), British law lord *Robert Parker (cricketer) (born 1942), Australian cricketer *Robert Parker (dancer), British dancer, principal dancer at Birmingham Royal Ballet *Robert Parker (historian) (born 1950), Wykeham Professor of Ancient History at Oxford University *Robert Parker (judge) (1796–1865), lawyer, judge and politician in New Brunswick *Robert Parker (minister) (1564–1614), English Puritan scholar and divine *Robert Parker (music producer), electronic musician from Stockholm, Sweden *Robert Parker (musician) (1847–1937), New Zealand organist, choirmaster and conductor *Robert Parker (singer) (1930–2020), American R&B; singer *Robert Parker (sound engineer) (1936–2004), Australian sound engineer and broadcaster *Robert Parker (water polo) (born 1987), British water polo player *Robert A.

His career continued as colonel in 1810, being aide-de-camp to King George III between 1810 and 1812 and then major general in 1813. He was present at most of the battles in the Peninsular War. In 1814, following service in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, he was appointed adjutant general of British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823. ==North American administration== After reaching the position of lieutenant-general in 1825, Aylmer was, in 1830, appointed commander of British military forces in North America as well as Governor General of British North America and Lieutenant Governor of Lower Canada. Lord Aylmer had no previous experience as a civil administrator and no political experience. He was unable to pacify the growing demands in Lower Canada for responsible government and, in 1834, the radical Assembly of Lower Canada passed 92 resolutions of grievance including a demand that Aylmer be recalled. Lord Aylmer exacerbated ethnic tensions in Lower Canada by favouring the English over the French. The deterioration of the situation led to his recall in 1835. His administration may have been a contributing factor to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. ==Return to England== Returning to England, Aylmer was promoted to the rank of general in 1845 but he never obtained a British peerage (his dignity was in the Irish peerage), nor another administrative post. He died at 15 Eaton Square, Belgravia on 23 February 1850, and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. Aylmer's sister Rose Aylmer was the inspiration behind the poem of that name by Walter Savage Landor. ==Family== Lady Louisa Anne Aylmer General the Right Honourable Matthew Whitworth, 5th Lord Aylmer, G.C.B., married Louisa Anne Call, daughter of Sir John Call, Bart. on 4 August 1801. When her husband was appointed in 1830 to administer the government of Canada, as Governor-General, from February 1831 to August 1835, the couple entertained at the Castle of St. Louis, Quebec. During the cholera epidemic of 1831–32, she was interested in the relief of the sufferers. Since she was interested in education, she regularly visited and bestowed prizes in the schools. She served as the patroness of the Societe d'Education sous la direction des dames lie Quebec. She died on 13 August 1862. ==References== * Works cited *Obituary, The Times, 26 February 1850 Category:1775 births Category:1850 deaths Category:18th- century English people Category:19th-century English people Category:British Army personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Governors of British North America Category:Barons Aylmer Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:British Army generals Category:Coldstream Guards officers Category:Burials at West Norwood Cemetery Category:English people of Irish descent Category:56th Regiment of Foot officers ","title":"Matthew Whitworth-Aylmer, 5th Baron Aylmer"},{"id":"529650","text":"Byron Kurt Lichtenberg, Sc.

Although regionally accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, the college was placed on probation in July 2014 for failing to meet the accreditor's standards regarding financial resources. The college announced on May 16, 2016, that it would cease operations on May 27. ==History== Burlington College started in 1972 as the Vermont Institute of Community Involvement. A handful of students met in the living room of founder Dr. Steward LaCasce. It originally served adult learners and veterans. In 2007, the college had 204 students at its main campus in buildings in downtown Burlington. Since most were part-time, this worked out to 130 \\"full-time equivalents\\". An additional 30 students studied off-campus. In 2010, Jane O’Meara Sanders oversaw the purchase of 33 acres of property to be used for college expansion, with the resulting significant debt to be covered by already pledged donations and tuition from planned increased enrollment over five years. Sanders departed shortly after, with Christine Plunkett assuming the position of president. In 2014, the regional accreditor of the college placed it on probation because of its financial condition, and votes of no confidence were given to Plunkett from organizations representing students, faculty, and staff. She resigned shortly thereafter. In 2015, the college resold 27.5 acres of the land it had purchased. In May 2016, the college board of trustees decided to close the school. According to David A. Graham, writing in The Atlantic, some of the school's financial difficulties dated back to 2010 when the board of directors and Sanders purchased the property in 2010. The original $11 million of debt had been worked down to about $2 million, but because of remaining debt and \\"insufficient financial resources\\", the school's bank declined to renew their $1 million line of credit, and the school was facing the loss of their accreditation. Local Burlington developer Eric Farrell will be purchasing the campus from the bank and plans to develop a park and housing. === Presidents === # 1972–1994: J.

The college sold its former campus to the Committee for Temporary Shelter, a welfare agency, and purchased of waterfront diocese property in early 2011. In 2015, the college arranged to sell a local developer a parcel of land, as well as the former diocesan orphanage attached to the office and classroom building. The developer, Farrell Real Estate, drafted a master plan to convert the orphanage to student housing. The college retained the original diocese building for classrooms, studios, art rooms, film and radio, laboratories, etc., and the surrounding property. At the press conference announcing the closure, the school stated that the developer would purchase the college's North Avenue campus from the bank. ==Academics== Burlington College offered a span of undergraduate programs in the arts, writing and literature, film studies, photography, fine arts, legal studies, transpersonal psychology/psychology, human services, media activism, and graphic design, and an individualized undergraduate and graduate degree program. The college offered students study-abroad options within Europe, and in 2008, Burlington College became one of the very few universities in the United States to offer a study-abroad program in Havana, Cuba in conjunction with the University of Havana. Students had the ability to spend a semester at the university or take one of several one-week trips offered throughout the academic year. Burlington College joined several other universities in the United States by offering students the option of a narrative evaluation in addition to traditional transcripts. In connection with the undergraduate legal studies program, Burlington College held an articulation agreement with Vermont Law School which allowed Burlington College graduates to proceed into the juris doctor and joint juris doctor programs at Vermont Law School upon successful completion of their undergraduate studies. Burlington College also offered an affiliation with the Vermont Woodworking School in Fairfax. The courses in woodworking and fine craftsmanship were offered for credit to support both associate of arts and bachelor of fine arts degree programs. In addition to woodworking skills, students took the usual general education requirements of the college. The degree could be taken on campus, at a distance, or in combination. Burlington College offered a low-residency master of arts degree. The degree was individualized and tailored to meet the academic needs and focus of individual graduate students. ===Rankings=== In August 2011, The Daily Beast and Newsweek ranked Burlington College as the number-one school in the United States for free-spirited students (free-spirited defined as schools where, \\"there are no mandatory classes, tests or official letter or number grades\\"). In October 2013, Newsweek named Burlington College as among the 10 colleges in the United States to have the highest rate of participation in student internships in their study field. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Defunct private universities and colleges in Vermont Category:Education in Burlington, Vermont Category:Educational institutions established in 1972 Category:Buildings and structures in Burlington, Vermont Category:Education in Chittenden County, Vermont Category:1972 establishments in Vermont Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2016 Category:2016 disestablishments in Vermont ","title":"Burlington College"},{"id":"529662","text":"Michael Weiner may refer to: *Michael Weiner (professor) (born 1949), professor of East Asian History *Michael Weiner (actor) (born 1975), American actor and composer *Michael Savage (Michael Weiner, born 1942), American talk- radio host and commentator *Michael Weiner (executive) (1961–2013), Executive Director of Major League Baseball Players Association *Michael Weiner (referee) (born 1969), German football referee ","title":"Michael Weiner"},{"id":"529666","text":"The Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas (Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Rights), more commonly CEDA, was a Spanish political party in the Second Spanish Republic. A Catholic conservative force, it was the political heir to Ángel Herrera Oria's Acción Popular and defined itself in terms of the 'affirmation and defence of the principles of Christian civilization,' translating this theoretical stand into a practical demand for the revision of the republican constitution. The CEDA saw itself as a defensive organisation, formed to protect religion, family, and property.Mary Vincent , Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic, Chapter 9, p.202 José María Gil-Robles declared his intention to \\"give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity...\\" and went on to say \\"Democracy is not an end but a mean to achieve the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either parliament submits or we will eliminate it.\\"Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 64. The CEDA held fascist-style rallies, called Gil-Robles \\"Jefe\\", the equivalent of Duce, and claimed that the CEDA might lead a \\"March on Madrid\\" (similar to the Italian Fascist March on Rome) to forcefully seize power.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 45, 69. The CEDA claimed that it was defending Spain and \\"Christian civilization\\" from Marxism, and claimed that the political atmosphere in Spain had made politics a matter of Marxism versus anti-Marxism.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 62. With the advent of the rise of the Nazi Party to power in Germany, the CEDA aligned itself with similar propaganda ploys to the Nazis, including the Nazi emphasis on authority, the fatherland, and hierarchy. Gil- Robles attended an audience at the Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg and was influenced by it, henceforth becoming committed to creating a single anti- Marxist counterrevolutionary front in Spain. CEDA was largely the party of the Catholic middle-class and Northern Spanish smallholders. It would ultimately be the most popular individual party in Spain in the 1936 elections.Payne, Stanley G. The Franco Regime, 1936–1975. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2011, p.46 The CEDA failed to make the substantive electoral gains from 1933 to 1936 (though it did see an increase in the number of individual votesPayne, Stanley G. The Franco Regime, 1936–1975. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2011, p.46) that were needed for it to form government which resulted in right-wing support draining from it and turning towards the belligerent Alfonsist monarchist leader José Calvo Sotelo.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 88–89. Subsequently, the CEDA abandoned its moderation and legalism and began providing support for those committed to violence against the republic, including handing over its electoral funds to the initial leader of the military coup against the republic, General Emilio Mola.Paul Preston. The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution & Revenge. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York, USA: Norton & Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 Pp. 89. Subsequently, many of the supporters of the CEDA's youth movement, Juventudes de Acción Popular (JAP; \\"Youth for Popular Action\\") began to defect en masse to join the Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista or \\"Falange\\". ==The CEDA eclipses the republican centre== Gil Robles set up CEDA to contest the 1933 election, and tacitly embraced Fascism.Preston (2006). pp. 63-65. Despite dismissing the idea of a party as a 'rigid fiction', the CEDA leaders created a stable party organisation which would lead the Spanish right into the age of mass politics.Vincent, p.202 The CEDA was constructed around organisational units known as Derechas Autónomas, the first of which had been established in Salamanca in December 1932. Having accepted the \\"principles of Christian civilization\\", confederated bodies retained full freedom both of thought and of action - such a definition was framed with the Carlists in mind. The right would work together for 'the radical transformation of the regime.' Gaceta Regional, 27 December 1932, 9 January 1933, quoted, M.Vincent, 203 The announcement of a general election in November 1933 brought about an unprecedented mobilization of the Spanish right. El Debate instructed its readers to make the coming elections into an \\"obsession\\", the \\" sublime culmination of citizenly duties,\\" so that victory in the polls would bring an end to the republican bienio rojo. Great emphasis was placed on the techniques of electoral propaganda. Gil Robles visited Nazi Germany to study modern methods, including the Nuremberg Rally. A national electoral committee was established, comprising CEDA, Alfonsist, Traditionalist, and Agrarian representatives - but excluding Miguel Maura's Conservative Republicans. The CEDA swamped entire localities with electoral publicity. The party produced ten million leaflets, together with some two hundred thousand coloured posters and hundreds of cars were used to distribute this material through the provinces. In all of the major cities propaganda films were shown around the streets on screens mounted on large lorries.Gil Robles, No fue posible la paz p.100 ==The polarization of political opinions and the CEDA== The need for unity was the constant theme of the campaign fought by the CEDA and the election was presented as a confrontation of ideas, not of personalities. The electors' choice was simple: they voted for redemption or revolution and they voted for Christianity or Communism. The fortunes of Republican Spain, according to one of its posters had been decided by 'immorality and anarchy'. Catholics who continued to proclaim their republicanism were moved into the revolutionary camp and many speeches argued that the Catholic republican option had become totally illegitimate. 'A good Catholic may not vote for the Conservative Republican party' declared a Gaceta Regional editorial and the impression was given that Conservative Republicans, far from being Catholics, were in fact anti-religious. In this all-round attack on the political centre, the mobilization of women also became a major electoral tactic of the Catholic right. The Asociación Femenina de Educación had been formed in October 1931. As the 1933 general election approached women were warned that unless they voted correctly communism would come \\" which will tear your children from your arms, your parish church will be destroyed, the husband you love will flee from your side authorized by the divorce law, anarchy will come to the countryside, hunger and misery to your home.\\" Gaceta Regional, 5 and 8 November 1933 AFEC orators and organisers urged women to vote 'For God and for Spain!' Mirroring the female qualities emphasized by AFEC the CEDA's self-styled sección de defensa brought young male activists to the fore. In one incident in the last week of the campaign, in Guijuelo the efforts of a group of left wing sympathisers to prevent people entering the bullring, where José María Lamamié de Clairac was speaking, led to a running battle with CEDA's sección de defensa. Later stopped and searched they were found to be carrying a quantity of pizzle whips - (bullwhips made from the dried penises of bulls) - taken along to 'fend off the violence which had been promised.' It was one example of the polarisation of political opinions which had occurred in the province of Salamanca, Robles's province, since the early days of the Republic. This new CEDA squad was also very much in evidence on election day itself, when its members patrolled the streets and polling stations in the provincial capital, supposedly to prevent the left from tampering with the ballot boxes.Vincent p. 212. In the 1933 elections, the CEDA won the most seats in the Cortes in no small part because the massive CNT membership abstained, holding true to their anarchist principles. The CEDA had won a plurality of seats; however, these were not enough to form a majority, but then President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government and instead invited the Radical Republican Party's Alejandro Lerroux to do so.Preston (2006). p. 67. CEDA supported the centrist government led by Lerroux; it later demanded and, on October 1, 1934, received three ministerial positions. They suspended most of the reforms of the previous Manuel Azaña government, provoking an armed miners' rebellion in Asturias on October 6, and an independentist rebellion in Catalonia--both rebellions were suppressed (the Asturias rebellion by young General Francisco Franco), being followed by mass political arrests and trials. CEDA continued to mimic the German Nazi Party, Robles staging a rally in March 1934, to shouts of \\"Jefe\\" (\\"Chief\\", after the Italian \\"Duce\\" used in support of Mussolini).Thomas (1961). p. 100.Preston (2006). p. 72. Robles used anti-strike law to pick union leaders off one by one, and attempted to undermine the republican government of the Republican Left of Catalonia, who attempted to continue the republic's previous reforms.Preston (2006). pp. 73-74. Using the title jefe, the JAP created an intense and often disturbing cult around the figure of Gil Robles. Robles himself had returned from Nuremberg Rally in 1933 and spoken of its \\" youthful enthusiasm, steeped in optimism, so different to the desolate and enervating scepticism of our defeatists and intellectuals.\\" Stanley Payne argues that CEDA was neither fascist nor democratic. Payne argues that CEDA's goal was to win power through legal means and to then enact a constitutional revision that would protect property and religion and alter the basic political system. They would create neither a fascist state nor an absolute monarchy but a Catholic, corporative republic. While this would entail the limitation of direct democratic rights, it would not be a state in the style of Hitler or Mussolini's but probably closer to the neighbouring Portuguese Estado Novo.Payne, Stanley G. Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977. University of Wisconsin Pres, 1999, p.45 The Juventudes de Acción Popular, the youth wing within the CEDA, \\"soon developed its own character. The JAP emphasized sporting and political activity. It had its own fortnightly paper, the first issue of which proclaimed: 'We want a new state.' The JAP's distaste for the principles of universal suffrage was such that internal decisions were never voted upon. As the thirteenth point of the JAP put it: \\"Anti-parliamentarianism. Anti-dictatorship. The people participating in Government in an organic manner, not by degenerate democracy.\\" The line between Christian corporatism and fascist statism became very thin indeed. The fascist tendencies of the JAP were vividly demonstrated in the series of rallies held by the CEDA youth movement during the course of 1934. On 26 September, the CEDA announced it would no longer support the RRP's minority government; it was replaced by a RRP cabinet, led by Lerroux once more, that included three members of the CEDA.Thomas (1961). p. 78. ==Rifts, moving further to the right== José María Gil-Robles at a campaign rally at San Sebastián in 1935. Between November 1934 and March 1935, the CEDA minister for agriculture, Manuel Gimenez Fernandez, introduced into parliament a series of agrarian reform measures designed to better conditions in the Spanish countryside. These moderate proposals met with a hostile response from reactionary elements within the Cortes, including the conservative wing of the CEDA and the proposed reform was defeated. A change of personnel in the ministry also followed. The agrarian reform bill proved to be a catalyst for a series of increasingly bitter divisions within the Catholic right, rifts that indicated that the broad based CEDA alliance was disintegrating. Partly as a result of the impetus of the JAP, the Catholic party had been moving further to the right, forcing the resignation of moderate government figures, including Filiberto Villalobos.Preston, Coming of the Spanish Civil war, 153-54 (2nd edn, 184) Gil Robles was not prepared to return the agriculture portfolio to Gimenez Fernandez. \\"For all the social Catholic rhetoric, the extreme right had won the day.\\" Vincent, p.235 Lerroux's Radical government collapsed after two large scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, and called elections. The elections of February 16, 1936 were narrowly won by the Popular front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right, who followed Nazi propaganda techniques.Preston (2006). pp. 82-83. CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter Emilio Mola. Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced Gil Robles as the right's leading spokesman in parliament.Preston (1999). pp. 17–23. The Falange expanded massively, and thousands of the JAP joined the organisation (though the majority of the JAP seem to have abandoned politics).Ruiz, Julius. The'red Terror'and the Spanish Civil War. Cambridge University Press, 2014, p.28 They successfully created a sense of militancy on the streets, in order to make an authoritarian regime justifiable.Preston (2006). p. 89. CEDA came under direct attack from the Falange.Preston (2006). p. 92. This rapid radicalization of the CEDA youth movement effectively meant that all attempts to save parliamentary Catholicism were doomed to failure. Many of the party's supporters welcomed the military rebellion in the summer of 1936 which led to the Spanish Civil War. In April 1937, the rebel leader Francisco Franco issued the Unification Decree which laid out the creation of the FET y de las JONS upon the merging of the Fascist FE de las JONS and the traditionalist carlists, outlawing the rest of political parties in the rebel- controlled territory. As result, CEDA ceased to exist. Many party cadres, including Franco's co-brother-in-law Ramon Serrano Suñer (who ended up becoming chief of the political junta of the FET y de las JONS) joined the new organization. ==See also== *:Category:CEDA politicians ==References== ==Sources== * *Preston, Paul.

Numbering about 11 million, they are the largest subgroup of the Mandé peoples and one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa. They speak the Mandinka language, which is one of the Western Manding languages in the Mande language family and a lingua franca in much of West Africa. Over 99% of Mandinka adhere to Islam. They are predominantly subsistence farmers and live in rural villages. Their largest urban center is Bamako, the capital of Mali, which is also inhabited by the closely related Bambara. The Mandinka are the descendants of the Mali Empire, which rose to power in the 13th century under the rule of king Sundiata Keita, who founded an empire that would go on to span a large part of West Africa. They migrated west from the Niger River in search of better agricultural lands and more opportunities for conquest. Nowadays, the Mandinka inhabit the West sudanian savanna region extending from The Gambia and the Casamance region in Senegal to Ivory Coast. Although widespread, the Mandinka constitute the largest ethnic group only in the countries of Mali, Guinea and The Gambia. Most Mandinka live in family-related compounds in traditional rural villages. Their traditional society has featured socially stratified castes. Mandinka communities have been fairly autonomous and self-ruled, being led by a chief and group of elders. Mandinka has been an oral society, where mythologies, history and knowledge are verbally transmitted from one generation to the next. Their music and literary traditions are preserved by a caste of griots, known locally as jelis, as well as guilds and brotherhoods like the donso (hunters). Between the 16th and 19th centuries, many Muslim and non-Muslim Mandinka people, along with numerous other African ethnic groups, were captured, enslaved and shipped to the Americas. They intermixed with slaves and workers of other ethnicities, creating a Creole culture. The Mandinka people significantly influenced the African heritage of descended peoples now found in Brazil, the Southern United States and, to a lesser extent, the Caribbean., Quote: \\"The identification of Mande influence in the South [United States], the Caribbean and Brazil, must also be conditioned with a huge reality—ethnic diversity. Slaves from hundreds of ethnic groups from all over Africa came into the South and the rest of the Americas along with the Mandinka/Mande.\\" ==History== The Mandés were initially a part of many fragmented kingdoms that formed after the collapse of Ghana empire in the 11th century. During the rule of Sundiata Keita, these kingdoms were consolidated, and the Mandinka expanded west from the Niger River basin under Sundiata's general Tiramakhan Traore. This expansion was a part of creating a region of conquest, according to the oral tradition of the Mandinka people. This migration began in the later part of the 13th century. Another group of Mandinka people, under Faran Kamara – the son of the king of Tabou – expanded southeast of Mali, while a third group expanded with Fakoli Kourouma. With the migration, many gold artisans and metal working Mandinka smiths settled along the coast and in the hilly Fouta Djallon and plateau areas of West Africa. Their presence and products attracted Mandika merchants and brought trading caravans from north Africa and the eastern Sahel, states Toby Green – a professor of African History and Culture. It also brought conflicts with other ethnic groups, such as the Wolof people, particularly the Jolof Empire. The caravan trade to North Africa and Middle East brought Islamic people into Mandinka people's original and expanded home region. The Muslim traders sought presence in the host Mandinka community, and this likely initiated proselytizing efforts to convert the Mandinka from their traditional religious beliefs into Islam. In Ghana, for example, the Almoravids had divided its capital into two parts by 1077, one part was Muslim and the other non-Muslim. The Muslim influence from North Africa had arrived in the Mandinka region before this, via Islamic trading diasporas. A map of West Africa showing Mandinka peoples, languages and influence, 1906. In 1324, Mansa Musa who ruled Mali, went on Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca with a caravan carrying gold. Shihab al-Umari, the Arabic historian, described his visit and stated that Musa built mosques in his kingdom, established Islamic prayers and took back Maliki school of Sunni jurists with him. According to Richard Turner – a professor of African American Religious History, Musa was highly influential in attracting North African and Middle Eastern Muslims to West Africa. The Mandinka people of Mali converted early, but those who migrated to the west did not convert and retained their traditional religious rites. One of the legends among the Mandingo of western Africa is that the general Tiramakhan Traore led the migration, because people in Mali had converted to Islam and he did not want to. Another legend gives a contrasting account, and states that Traore himself had converted and married Muhammad's granddaughter. The Traore's marriage with a Muhammad's granddaughter, states Toby Green, is fanciful, but these conflicting oral histories suggest that Islam had arrived well before the 13th century and had a complex interaction with the Mandinka people. Through a series of conflicts, primarily with the Fula-led jihads under Imamate of Futa Jallon, many Mandinka converted to Islam. In contemporary West Africa, the Mandinka are predominantly Muslim, with a few regions where significant portions of the population are not Muslim, such as Guinea Bissau, where 35 percent of the Mandinka practice Islam, more than 20 percent are Christian, and 15 percent follow traditional beliefs. ===Slavery=== Slave raiding, capture and trading in the Mandinka regions may have existed in significant numbers before the European colonial era, as is evidenced in the memoirs of the 14th century Moroccan traveller and Islamic historian Ibn Battuta. Slaves were part of the socially stratified Mandinka people, and several Mandinka language words, such as Jong or Jongo refer to slaves. There were fourteen Mandinke kingdoms along the Gambia River in the Senegambia region during the early 19th century, for example, where slaves were a part of the social strata in all these kingdoms. { class=\\" floatright\\" + style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Slave shipment between 1501–1867, by regionDavid Eltis and David Richardson (2015), Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, 2nd Edition, Yale University Press, ; Archive: Slave Route Maps , see Map 9; The transatlantic slave trade volume over the 350+ years involved an estimated 12.5 million Africans, almost every country that bordered the Atlantic ocean, as well as Mozambique and the Swahili coast. - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\"  Region !! scope=\\"col\\"  Total embarked !! scope=\\"col\\"  Total disembarked - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Kongo people region  5.69 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Bight of Benin  2.00 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Bight of Biafra  1.6 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: #F4A460;\\"  Gold Coast  1.21 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Windward Coast  0.34 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Sierra Leone  0.39 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: #F4A460;\\"  Senegambia  0.76 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Mozambique  0.54 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\"  Brazil (South America)   4.7 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" Rest of South America   0.9 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" Caribbean   4.1 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" North America   0.4 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" Europe   0.01 million } According to Toby Green, selling slaves along with gold was already a significant part of the trans-Saharan caravan trade across the Sahel between West Africa and the Middle East after the 13th century. With the arrival of Portuguese explorers in Africa as they looked for a sea route to India, the European purchase of slaves had begun. The shipment of slaves by the Portuguese, primarily from the Jolof people, along with some Mandinka, started in the 15th century, states Green, but the earliest evidence of a trade involving Mandinka slaves is from and after 1497 CE. In parallel with the start of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the institution of slavery and slave- trading of West Africans into the Mediterranean region and inside Africa continued as a historic normal practice. Slavery grew significantly between the 16th and 19th century. The Portuguese considered slave sources in Guinea and Senegambia parts of Mandinka territory as belonging to them, with their 16th to 18th century slave trade-related documents referring to \\"our Guinea\\" and complaining about French and British slave trading ships overrunning them. Their slave exports from this region nearly doubled in the second half of the 18th century compared to the first, but most of these slaves disembarked in Brazil. Scholars have offered several theories on the source of the transatlantic slave trade of Mandinka people. According to Boubacar Barry, a professor of History and African Studies, chronic violence between ethnic groups such as Mandinka people and their neighbours, combined with weapons sold by slave traders and lucrative income from slave ships to the slave sellers, fed the practice of captives, raiding, manhunts, and slaves. The victimised ethnic group felt justified in retaliating. Slavery was already an accepted practice before the 15th century. As the demand grew, states Barry, Futa Jallon led by an Islamic military theocracy became one of the centers of this slavery-perpetuating violence, while Farim of Kaabu – or the commander of Mandinka people in Kaabu – energetically hunted slaves on a large scale. Kaabu was, states Martin Klein – a professor of African Studies, one of early suppliers of African slaves to European merchants.; Quote: \\"Kaabu, for example, began as a Malian colony that provided sea salt and other coastal products to the Mandinka heartland, but it moved early into supplying slaves to European merchants\\". (p. 39) The historian Walter Rodney states that Mandinka and other ethnic groups already had slaves who inherited slavery by birth, and who could be sold. The Islamic armies from Sudan had long established the practice of slave raids and trade. Fula jihad from Futa Jallon plateau perpetuated and expanded this practice.Walter Rodney (1968), \\"Jihad and Social Revolution in Futa Djalon in the Eighteenth Century\\", Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria, Volume 4, Number 2, pp. 269–284. These jihads were the largest producer of slaves for the Portuguese traders at the ports controlled by Mandinka people. The insecure ethnic groups, states Rodney, stopped working productively and became withdrawn, which made social and economic conditions desperate, and they also joined the retaliatory cycle of slave raids and violence. Walter Hawthorne – a professor of African History, states that the Barry and Rodney explanation was not universally true for all of Senegambia and Guinea where high concentrations of Mandinka people have traditionally lived. Hawthorne states that large numbers of Mandinka people started arriving as slaves in Portuguese, French and British colonies in the Caribbean and South America, only between mid 18th through to the 19th century. During these years, slave trade records show that nearly 33% of the slaves from Senegambia and Guinea-Bissau coasts were Mandinka people. Hawthorne suggests three causes of Mandinka people appearing as slaves during this era: small scale jihads by Muslims against non-Muslim Mandinka, non- religious reasons such as economic greed of Islamic elites who wanted imports from the coast, and attacks by the Fula people on Mandinka's Kaabu with consequent cycle of violence. ==Economy== Mandinka marabout Mandinka are rural subsistence farmers in the Sahel who rely on peanuts, rice, millet, maize, and small-scale husbandry for their livelihood. During the wet season, men plant peanuts as their main cash crop. Men also grow millet and women grow rice (traditionally, African rice), tending the plants by hand.Schaffer, Matt (2003). Djinns, Stars, and Warriors: Mandinka Legends from Pakao, Senegal. Leiden: Springer-Brill. p. 6. This is extremely labour-intensive and physically demanding work. Only about 50% of the rice consumption needs are met by local planting; the rest is imported from Asia and the United States. The oldest male is the head of the family and marriages are commonly arranged. Small mud houses with conical thatch or tin roofs make up their villages, which are organised on the basis of the clan groups. While farming is the predominant profession among the Mandinka, men also work as tailors, butchers, taxi drivers, woodworkers, metalworkers, soldiers, nurses, and extension workers for aid agencies. However, most women, probably 95%, tend to the home, children, and animals as well as work alongside the men in the fields. ==Religion== Today, over 99% of Mandinka are Muslim. Mandinkas recite chapters of the Qur'an in Arabic. Some Mandinka syncretise Islam and traditional African religions. Among these syncretists spirits can be controlled mainly through the power of a marabout, who knows the protective formulas. In most cases, no important decision is made without first consulting a marabout. Marabouts, who have Islamic training, write Qur'anic verses on slips of paper and sew them into leather pouches (talisman); these are worn as protective amulets. The conversion to Islam took place over many centuries. According to Robert Wyndham Nicholls, Mandinka in Senegambia started converting to Islam as early as the 17th century, and most of Mandinka leatherworkers there converted to Islam before the 19th century. The Mandinka musicians, however were last, converting to Islam mostly in the first half of the 20th century. Like elsewhere, these Muslims have continued their pre-Islamic religious practices such as their annual rain ceremony and \\"sacrifice of the black bull\\" to their past deities. ==Society and culture== Mandinka dancing Most Mandinkas live in family-related compounds in traditional rural villages. Mandinka villages are fairly autonomous and self-ruled, being led by a council of upper class elders and a chief who functions as a first among equals. ===Social stratification=== The Mandinka people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, like many West African ethnic groups with castes., Quote: \\"[Castes] are found among the Soninke, the various Manding-speaking populations, the Wolof, Tukulor, Senufo, Minianka, Dogon, Songhay and most Fulani, Moorish and Tuareg populations\\". The Mandinka society, states Arnold Hughes – a professor of West African Studies and African Politics, has been \\"divided into three endogamous castes – the freeborn (foro), slaves (jongo), and artisans and praise singers (nyamolo). The freeborn castes are primarily farmers, while the slave strata included labor providers to the farmers, as well as leather workers, pottery makers, metal smiths, griots, and others. The Mandinka Muslim clerics and scribes have traditionally been considered as a separate occupational caste called Jakhanke, with their Islamic roots traceable to about the 13th century., Quote: \\"The Jakhanke, who now primarily speak Mandinka, have formed a specialized caste of Muslim clerics and educators since approximately the 13th century\\". The Mandinka castes are hereditary, and marriages outside the caste was forbidden. Their caste system is similar to those of other ethnic groups of the African Sahel region,, Quote: \\"The general organization of the society into castes is shared with Sahelian peoples such as the Mandinka, Wolof, (...)\\" and found across the Mandinka communities such as those in Gambia, Mali, Guinea and other countries. ===Rites of passage=== The Mandinka practice a rite of passage, kuyangwoo, which marks the beginning of adulthood for their children. At an age between four and fourteen, the youngsters have their genitalia ritually cut (see articles on male and female genital cutting), in separate groups according to their sex. In years past, the children spent up to a year in the bush, but that has been reduced now to coincide with their physical healing time, between three and four weeks. During this time, they learn about their adult social responsibilities and rules of behaviour. Preparation is made in the village or compound for the return of the children. A celebration marks the return of these new adults to their families. As a result of these traditional teachings, in marriage a woman's loyalty remains to her parents and her family; a man's to his. Female genital mutilation The women among the Mandinka people, like other ethnic groups near them, have traditionally practiced female genital mutilation (FGM), traditionally referred to as \\"female circumcision.\\" According to UNICEF, the female genital mutilation prevalence rates among the Mandinkas of the Gambia is the highest at over 96%, followed by FGM among the women of the Jola people's at 91% and Fula people at 88%.Accelerating the Abandonment of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) in The Gambia, UNICEF (2012) Among the Mandinka women of some other countries of West Africa, the FGM prevalence rates are lower, but range between 40% to 90%.Berhane Ras-Work (2009), LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION (FGM), UN, page 11 This cultural practice, locally called Niaka or Kuyungo or Musolula Karoola or Bondo,Multi-Agency Practice Guidelines: Female Genital Mutilation, HM Government, United Kingdom (2014), involves the partial or total removal of the clitoris, or alternatively, the partial or total removal of the labia minora with the clitoris. Some surveys, such as those by the Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices (GAMCOTRAP), estimate FGM is prevalent among 100% of the Mandinkas in Gambia. In 2010, after community efforts of UNICEF and the local government bodies, several Mandinka women's organization pledged to abandon the female genital mutilation practices. ===Marriage=== Marriages are traditionally arranged by family members rather than either the bride or groom. This practice is particularly prevalent in the rural areas. Kola nuts, a bitter nut from a tree, are formally sent by the suitor's family to the male elders of the bride-to-be, and if accepted, the courtship begins. Polygamy has been practiced among the Mandinka since pre- Islamic days. A Mandinka man is legally allowed to have up to four wives, as long as he is able to care for each of them equally. Mandinka believe the crowning glory of any woman is the ability to produce children, especially sons. The first wife has authority over any subsequent wives. The husband has complete control over his wives and is responsible for feeding and clothing them. He also helps the wives' parents when necessary. Wives are expected to live together in harmony, at least superficially. They share work responsibilities of the compound, such as cooking, laundry, and other tasks. ===Music=== A Mandinka Griot Al-Haji Papa Susso performing songs from the oral tradition of the Gambia on the kora. Mandinka culture is rich in tradition, music, and spiritual ritual. Mandinkas continue a long oral history tradition through stories, songs, and proverbs. In rural areas, western education's impact is minimal; the literacy rate in Latin script among these Mandinka is quite low. However, more than half the adult population can read the local Arabic script (including Mandinka Ajami); small Qur'anic schools for children where this is taught are quite common. Mandinka children are given their name on the eighth day after their birth, and their children are almost always named after a very important person in their family. The Mandinka have a rich oral history that is passed down through griots. This passing down of oral history through music has made music one of the most distinctive traits of the Mandinka. They have long been known for their drumming and also for their unique musical instrument, the kora. The kora is a twenty-one-stringed West- African harp made out of a halved, dried, hollowed-out gourd covered with cow or goat skin. The strings are made of fishing line (these were traditionally made from a cow's tendons). It is played to accompany a griot's singing or simply on its own. A Mandinka religious and cultural site under consideration for World Heritage status is located in Guinea at Gberedou/Hamana. Mandinka saber, Gallieni collection MHNT The kora The kora has become the hallmark of traditional Mandinka musicians\\". The kora with its 21 strings is made from half a calabash, covered with cow's hide fastened on by decorative tacks. The kora has sound holes in the side which are used to store coins offered to the praise singers, in appreciation of their performance. The praise singers are called \\"jalibaas\\" or \\"jalis\\" in Mandinka. ==In literature and other media== One Mandinka outside Africa is Kunta Kinte, a main figure in Alex Haley's book Roots and a subsequent TV mini-series. Haley claimed he was descended from Kinte, though this familial link has been criticised by many professional historians and at least one genealogist as highly improbable (see D. Wright's The World And A Very Small Place). Martin R. Delany, a 19th- century abolitionist, military leader, politician and physician in the United States, was of partial Mandinka descent. Sinéad O'Connor's 1988 hit \\"Mandinka\\" was inspired by Alex Haley's book. Mr. T, of American television fame, once claimed that his distinctive hairstyle was modelled after a Mandinka warrior that he saw in National Geographic magazine.Mentioned in a number of interviews, including Mr. T: Pity The Fool , allhiphop.com, Published Thursday, November 9, 2006. Mr. T gives a 1977 date, for an article with photos on the Mandinka in Mali. National Geographic Magazine's index has no record of such an article. http://publicationsindex.nationalgeographic.com/ . In his motivational video Be Somebody... or Be Somebody's Fool!, he states: \\"My folks came from Africa. They were from the Mandinka tribe. They wore their hair like this. These gold chains I wear symbolize the fact that my ancestors were brought over here as slaves.\\"Be Somebody... or Be Somebody's Fool! at Youtube In a 2006 interview, he reiterated that he modeled his hair style after photographs of Mandinka men he saw in National Geographic.Mr. T: Pity The Fool interview by Greg Watkins Many early works by Malian author Massa Makan Diabaté are retellings of Mandinka legends, including Janjon, which won the 1971 Grand prix littéraire d'Afrique noire. His novels The Lieutenant of Kouta, The Barber of Kouta and The Butcher of Kouta attempt to capture the proverbs and customs of the Mandinka people in novelistic form. ==Notable people by countrySierra Leone=== * Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of Sierra Leone from 1996 to 2007 * Haja Afsatu Kabba, former Sierra Leone's Minister of Marine Resources and Fisheries; Energy and Power; Lands * Alhaji Mohamed Kemoh Fadika, current Sierra Leone's High Commissioner to the Gambia and former High Commissioner to Nigeria, former Ambassador to Egypt and Iran. * Mabinty Daramy, current Sierra Leone's Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry * Fode Dabo, former Sierra Leone Ambassador to Belgium, France, Netherlands, Luxemburg and Italy and former High Commissioner to the Gambia. * Alhaji Shekuba Saccoh, former Sierra Leone's ambassador to Guinea and former Minister of Social Welfare * Ibrahim Jaffa Condeh, Sierra Leonean journalist and news anchor * Mohamed Kakay, former MP of Sierra Leone from Koinadugu District (SLPP) * Mohamed B.

She was transferred to the fledgling Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in 1912. During World War I, the cruiser captured two German merchant ships, and was involved in the East African Campaign, including the blockade of the cruiser and a bombardment of Dar-es- Salaam. She returned to Australia in late 1916 and was decommissioned. Pioneer was used as an accommodation ship for the following six years, then was stripped down and sold off by 1926. The cruiser was scuttled outside Sydney Heads in 1931. ==Design and construction== Pioneer was a third-class protected cruiser of the nine-ship Pelorus or P class.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 111 These ships had a displacement of 2,200 tons, were long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion was supplied by inverted three-cylinder triple expansion steam engines, providing to two propeller shafts.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 112 Although designed to reach speeds of , Pioneer was only capable of . The cruiser was armed with eight single QF guns, eight single QF 3-pounder guns, two field guns, three Maxim machine guns, and two torpedo tubes sited above the waterline. The ship's company initially stood at 225, but this was later reduced to 188; 12 officers, and 176 sailors. Pioneer was laid down for the Royal Navy at HM Dockyard, Chatham, Kent on 16 December 1897. She was launched 28 June 1899 by Miss Andoe, daughter of the dockyard's admiral superintendent. The cruiser was completed on 23 January 1900, and was placed in reserve until her commissioning on 10 July 1900. ==Operational history== Pioneer spent the majority of 1900 in British waters, before sailing for the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Commander Hugh Evan-Thomas on 15 November. Commander George Hope was appointed in command on 5 July 1902, taking up the command later that month after a visit by the ship to Brindisi. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until returning to Chatham on 20 November 1904. Pioneer was decommissioned until 5 September 1905, when she was reactivated for service as a drill ship with the Australian Squadron of the Royal Navy. On 29 November 1912, Pioneer was decommissioned and gifted to the Australian government, who commissioned the ship as part of the Royal Australian Navy on 1 March 1913. Initially used as a tender for the naval base at Garden Island, New South Wales, Pioneer was refitted during the second half of 1913, and on 1 January 1914, was reassigned for reservist training. At the start of World War I, Pioneer sailed from Victoria to Western Australia, where she served as a patrol vessel. On 16 August, she captured the German merchant ship Neumunster, which was taken by the Australian government as a prize of war and renamed Cooee. Ten days later, the cruiser captured a second German ship, the Norddeutscher Lloyd liner Thuringen, which was presented to the government of India for use as a troop transport. On 1 November, Pioneer joined the escort of the convoy transporting the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to Egypt as a replacement for the Japanese cruiser Nisshin, and with orders to check on the Cocos Islands during the voyage. However, as the Australian warship took up position, she suffered a major engine malfunction, and joined the convoy instead. Pioneer undergoing refit in Simon's Town, South Africa during late 1915 In late December, the cruiser was assigned to the blockade of German East Africa, and sailed for Zanzibar on 9 January 1915. On arrival, Pioneer was ordered to help contain the German cruiser in the Rufiji River and prevent German supply ships from arriving. Königsberg was scuttled on 12 July following shelling by two monitors, although Pioneer remained in the region until 31 August, when she sailed to Simon's Town in South Africa for a six- week refit.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 112–3 Pioneer returned to uneventful patrols of German East Africa on 22 October, and continued until early February 1916, when the Admiralty instructed the ship to return to Australia.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 113 However, before she could leave, demands by General Jan Smuts for more Admiralty involvement in the East African Campaign saw Pioneer return to patrols on 24 February. On 30 July, the cruiser fired 100 4-inch shells during the bombardment of Dar-es-Salaam. ==Decommissioning and fate== Pioneer was ordered to return to Australia on 8 August 1916, and was paid off on 7 November 1916. Despite being \\"obsolete and decrepit\\" she saw more actual combat than any other Australian ship of World War I. Pioneer returned to Garden Island and was used as an accommodation vessel until 1922. She was handed to Cockatoo Island Dockyard for stripping in May 1923, was passed to the control of the Commonwealth Shipping Board in 1924, who then sold the hulk to H. P. Stacey of Sydney, in 1926. The ship was scuttled off Sydney Heads on 18 February 1931. The location of the wreck was lost until March 2014, when it was rediscovered by wreck-hunters analysing data taken from the research vessel Southern Surveyor. Pioneers wreck sits below sea level, at , approximately east of Vaucluse. The wreck lies with the bow towards the south-east, and is intact in places, with structures rising up to from the sea floor. Following a reorganisation of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, Pioneer was retroactively awarded the honour \\"German East Africa 1915–16\\" in recognition of her wartime service. ==Citations== ==References== * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:Pelorus-class cruisers of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built in Chatham Category:1899 ships Category:Pelorus-class cruisers of the Royal Australian Navy Category:World War I cruisers of Australia Category:Scuttled vessels of New South Wales Category:Shipwrecks in the Tasman Sea Category:Maritime incidents in 1931 ","title":"HMAS Pioneer"},{"id":"529669","text":"The Council of Science Editors (CSE), formerly the Conference of Biology Editors (CBE), is a United States-based nonprofit organization that supports editorial practice among scientific writers.

He graduated from Hattiesburg High School in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in 1960. He also received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1964, and a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1972. Stewart is married and has two children. His interests include woodworking, photography, and skiing. ==Military career== Stewart entered on active duty with the United States Army in May 1964 and was assigned as an air defense artillery director at the 32nd NORAD Region Headquarters (SAGE), Gunter Air Force Base, Alabama. In July 1966, after completing rotary wing training at Fort Wolters, Texas, and Fort Rucker, Alabama, he was designated an Army Aviator. He flew 1,035 hours of combat time during Vietnam War from August 1966 to 1967, primarily as a fire team leader in the armed helicopter platoon of \\"A\\" Company, 101st Aviation Battalion (redesignated 336th Assault Helicopter Company). He was an instructor pilot at the U.S. Army Primary Helicopter School -- serving one year in the pre-solo/primary-1 phase of instruction and about 6 months as commander of methods of instruction flight III, training rated aviators to become instructor pilots. He is a graduate of the U.S. Army's Air Defense Artillery School's Air Defense Officers Advanced Course and Guided Missile Systems Officers Course. Stewart served in Seoul, Korea, from 1972 to 1973, with the 309th Aviation Battalion (Combat) as a battalion operations officer and battalion executive officer. He next attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, completing the Rotary Wing Test Pilot Course in 1974, and was then assigned as an experimental test pilot to the U.S. Army Aviation Engineering Flight Activity at Edwards Air Force Base, California. His duties there included chief of the integrated systems test division, as well as participating in engineering flight tests of UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters and U-21 and OV-1 fixed wing aircraft, serving as project officer and senior test pilot on the Hughes YAH-64 advanced attack helicopter during government competitive testing; and participation with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation test pilots in developing an electronic automatic flight control system for the new Army transport helicopter -- the UH-60A Black Hawk. He has military and civilian experience in 38 types of airplanes and helicopters and logged approximately 6,000 hours total flight time. ==NASA career== Robert L. Stewart Stewart became a NASA astronaut in August 1979. His technical duties in the Astronaut Office included: testing and evaluation of the entry flight control systems for STS-1 (the first Space Shuttle orbital mission), ascent abort procedures development, and payload coordination. He also served as support crewman for STS-4, and Ascent/Orbit CAPCOM for STS-5. He served as a mission specialist on STS-41-B in 1984 and STS-51-J in 1985, and logged a total of 289 hours in space, including approximately 12 hours of EVA operations. Although astronauts who had served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II (including Gus Grissom and Deke Slayton) had previously flown, Stewart was the first active-duty Army officer to make a spaceflight. While in training for his scheduled third flight (STS-61-K, ultimately cancelled as a result of the Challenger disaster) in 1986, Stewart was selected by the Army for promotion to Brigadier General. Upon accepting this promotion, Stewart was reassigned from NASA to be the Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command, in Huntsville, Alabama. In this capacity, Stewart managed research efforts in developing ballistic missile defense technology. He was reassigned as Director of Plans, United States Space Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1989. ==Spaceflight experience== STS-41-B Challenger (February 3–11, 1984) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land there 8 days later. During the mission, Stewart and fellow astronaut Bruce McCandless participated in two extravehicular activities (EVAs) to conduct first flight evaluations of the Manned Maneuvering Units (MMUs). These EVAs represented man's first untethered operations from a spacecraft in flight. Upon completion of this mission Stewart became the first Army officer awarded the Army Astronaut Badge. Stewart first EVA, together with Bruce McCandless lasted 6 hours and 17 minutes. During the second EVA, Stewart used the MMU for an untethered spacewalk, lasted 5 hours and 55 minutes. STS-51-J Atlantis (October 3–7, 1985) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and after 98 hours of orbital operations returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the second Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, and the maiden voyage of Atlantis. During the mission, he was responsible for a number of on- orbit activities. ==Later career== Stewart (left) with John Rouse, University of Texas at Arlington Dean of Engineering, 1984 Stewart retired from the Army in 1992 and made his home in Woodland Park, Colorado, for many years. He was employed as director of advanced programs at the Nichols Research Corporation in Colorado Springs, Colorado, before retiring. He later moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where he currently resides. He makes daily appearances at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, greeting visitors and signing autographs. ==Organizations== He has been a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Association of Space Explorers, Phi Eta Sigma, and the Scabbard and Blade (a military honor society). ==Awards and honors== *60px Army Distinguished Service Medal *60px Defense Superior Service Medal *60px Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster *60px Distinguished Flying Cross with three oak leaf clusters *60px Bronze Star *60px Purple Heart with oak leaf cluster *60px Meritorious Service Medal *60px Air Medal with six silver oak leaf clusters and two bronze oak leaf clusters *60px Army Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster and Valor device *60px NASA Space Flight Medals (1984 & 1985) *60px National Defense Service Medal *60px Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal *60px Vietnam Service Medal *60px Vietnam Cross of Gallantry *60px Vietnam Campaign Medal *Army Aviation Award of the Year, 1984 *AHS Feinberg Memorial Award *AIAA Oberth Award ==References== ==External links== *NASA bio *Spacefacts biography of Robert Stewart Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:American astronauts Category:United States Army astronauts Category:People from Hattiesburg, Mississippi Category:University of Southern Mississippi alumni Category:University of Texas at Arlington alumni Category:United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni Category:United States Army generals Category:American test pilots Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army) Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Recipients of the Defense Superior Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Gallantry Cross (Vietnam) Category:People from Woodland Park, Colorado Category:Space Shuttle program astronauts ","title":"Robert L.

Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes are essential to many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling. Whereas phosphatases remove phosphate groups from molecules, kinases catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups to molecules from ATP. Together, kinases and phosphatases direct a form of post- translational modification that is essential to the cell's regulatory network. Phosphatase enzymes are not to be confused with phosphorylase enzymes, which catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from hydrogen phosphate to an acceptor. Due to their prevalence in cellular regulation, phosphatases are an area of interest for pharmaceutical research. == Biochemistry == The general reaction catalyzed by a phosphatase enzyme Phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of a phosphomonoester, removing a phosphate moiety from the substrate. Water is split in the reaction, with the -OH group attaching to the phosphate ion, and the H+ protonating the hydroxyl group of the other product. The net result of the reaction is the destruction of a phosphomonoester and the creation of both a phosphate ion and a molecule with a free hydroxyl group. Phosphatases are able to dephosphorylate seemingly different sites on their substrates with great specificity. Identifying the \\"phosphatase code,\\" that is, the mechanisms and rules that govern substrate recognition for phosphatases, is still a work in progress, but the first comparative analysis of all the protein phosphatases encoded across nine eukaryotic 'phosphatome' genomes is now available. Studies reveal that so called \\"docking interactions\\" play a significant role in substrate binding. A phosphatase recognizes and interacts with various motifs (elements of secondary structure) on its substrate; these motifs bind with low affinity to docking sites on the phosphatase, which are not contained within its active site. Although each individual docking interaction is weak, many interactions occur simultaneously, conferring a cumulative effect on binding specificity. Docking interactions can also allosterically regulate phosphatases and thus influence their catalytic activity. == Functions == In contrast to kinases, phosphatase enzymes recognize and catalyze a wider array of substrates and reactions. For example, in humans, Ser/Thr kinases outnumber Ser/Thr phosphatases by a factor of ten. To some extent, this disparity results from incomplete knowledge of the human phosphatome, that is, the complete set of phosphatases expressed in a cell, tissue, or organism. Many phosphatases have yet to be discovered, and for numerous known phosphatases, a substrate has yet to be identified. However, among well-studied phosphatase/kinase pairs, phosphatases exhibit greater variety than their kinase counterparts in both form and function; this may result from the lesser degree of conservation among phosphatases.Calcineurin (PP2B) is a protein phosphatase enzyme involved in immune system function. === Protein phosphatases === A protein phosphatase is an enzyme that dephosphorylates an amino acid residue of its protein substrate. Whereas protein kinases act as signaling molecules by phosphorylating proteins, phosphatases remove the phosphate group, which is essential if the system of intracellular signaling is to be able to reset for future use. The tandem work of kinases and phosphatases constitute a significant element of the cell's regulatory network. Phosphorylation (and dephosphorylation) is among the most common modes of posttranslational modification in proteins, and it is estimated that, at any given time, up to 30% of all proteins are phosphorylated. Two notable protein phosphatases are PP2A and PP2B. PP2A is involved in multiple regulatory processes, such as DNA replication, metabolism, transcription, and development. PP2B, also called calcineurin, is involved in the proliferation of T cells; because of this, it is the target of some drugs that seek to suppress the immune system.Nucleosides and nucleotides differ by one phosphate, which is cleaved from nucleotides by nucleotidases. === Nucleotidases === A nucleotidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a nucleotide, forming a nucleoside and a phosphate ion. Nucleotidases are essential for cellular homeostasis, because they are partially responsible for maintaining a balanced ratio of nucleotides to nucleosides. Some nucleotidases function outside the cell, creating nucleosides that can be transported into the cell and used to regenerate nucleotides via salvage pathways. Inside the cell, nucleotidases may help to maintain energy levels under stress conditions. A cell deprived of oxygen and nutrients may catabolize more nucleotides to boost levels of nucleoside triphosphates such as ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. === In gluconeogenesis === Phosphatases can also act on carbohydrates, such as intermediates in gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is a biosynthetic pathway wherein glucose is created from noncarbohydrate precursors; the pathway is essential because many tissues can only derive energy from glucose. Two phosphatases, glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, catalyze irreversible steps in gluconeogenesis. Each cleaves a phosphate group from a six-carbon sugar phosphate intermediate. == Classification == Within the larger class of phosphatase, the Enzyme Commission recognizes 104 distinct enzyme families. Phosphatases are classified by substrate specificity and sequence homology in catalytic domains. Despite their classification into over one hundred families, all phosphatases still catalyze the same general hydrolysis reaction. In in-vitro experiments, phosphatase enzymes seem to recognize many different substrates, and one substrate may be recognized by many different phosphatases. However, when experiments have been carried out in-vivo, phosphatase enzymes have been shown to be incredibly specific. In some cases, a protein phosphatase (i.e. one defined by its recognition of protein substrates) can catalyze the dephosphorylation of nonprotein substrates. Similarly, dual-specificity tyrosine phosphatases can dephosphorylate not only tyrosine residues, but also serine residues. Thus, one phosphatase can exhibit the qualities of multiple phosphatase families. == See also == *Acid phosphatase *Alkaline phosphatase *Endonuclease/Exonuclease/phosphatase family *Kinase *Phosphatome *Phosphotransferase *Protein phosphatase *Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) == References == == External links == * Category:EC 3.1.3 ","title":"Phosphatase"},{"id":"529679","text":"Castleton University is a public university in Castleton, Vermont.

The Grammar School was a regional school, preparing young men for college through instruction in traditional academic subjects such as Latin and Greek. The institution frequently changed its name during the 19th century. At various times it was known as Castleton Academy, Castleton Academy and Female Seminary, Vermont Classical High School, and Castleton Seminary. In 1823, instruction in \\"the solid branches of female education\\" began for \\"young Ladies and Misses\\". By the time of the Civil War, the majority of the students attending Castleton were young women. In 1829, a three-story brick building costing US$30,000 was constructed on a small hill south of the village. Principal Solomon Foot (1826–1829), who would go on to be President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate during the Civil War, was the driving force in this expansion of the school. The Seminary Building (eventually known as the Old Seminary Building) was the most impressive structure in the village, but expensive to maintain and often too large for the school's struggling enrollment. Castleton Medical College (1818–1862) was also located in the village. It graduated 1400 students, more than any other medical school in New England at the time. Although Castleton Medical College and Castleton Seminary were separate institutions, they often shared faculty. Today the former medical college building, known as the Old Chapel, is the oldest building on the campus.Waite, Frederick Clayton. The First Medical College in Vermont: Castleton 1818–1862. Vermont Historical Society (1949). The first female principal was Harriet Newell Haskell (1862–1867). She had attended the Seminary as a child, took classes at Middlebury College without being permitted to matriculate, and then attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, which was not yet a college but offered a college-level curriculum for women. Although Haskell was in her 20s when she served as principal, the school flourished under her administration. With her departure to be principal of Monticello Ladies Seminary in Godfrey, Illinois, Castleton Seminary went into decline. The school began its transition to a college in 1867, when the State Normal School at Castleton was founded as one of three state normal schools chartered by Vermont. Normal schools educated students for teaching careers. For 30 years the Normal School property and grounds were privately owned by Abel E. Leavenworth and his son Philip. In 1912, the State of Vermont purchased the property. In the 1920s and 1930s, under the direction of Caroline Woodruff, the College experienced dramatic growth in students and its stature. Woodruff modernized the school's curriculum, incorporating the theories of Vermont educator-philosopher John Dewey, especially his precepts of \\"learning by doing\\" and \\"learning by teaching\\". She hired staff with advanced degrees, and broadened her students' exposure to the world by bringing people such as Helen Keller, Robert Frost, and Norman Rockwell to Castleton. Woodruff was the first and only Vermonter to become president of the National Education Association. In 1947, the Normal School became Castleton Teachers College. With increased enrollment from men, intercollegiate athletics began in the 1950s. In 1962, the institution became Castleton State College when it joined other state-supported colleges in becoming a part of the Vermont State Colleges, a consortium of colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor, and Council of Presidents, each college having its own president and deans.Vermont State Colleges Manual of Policies and Procedures, Section A: Statute and By-Laws. Vermont State Colleges (2003). pgs. 4, 21. In 1979, the Board of Trustees proposed a name change to Southern Vermont State College; the proposal was never acted on. On July 23, 2015, the Vermont State Colleges Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the institution to Castleton University. Nearby Rutland plays host to the Castleton Polling Institute, as well as a professional development center for educators and entrepreneurs. In September 2016, the university opened Foley Hall, a two-floor residence, in collaboration with Green Mountain Power and Efficiency Vermont that provides housing for students. Castleton extended its reach into Bennington County in 2019, when it began a partnership with Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington to host its B.S. registered nurse program after the closure of Southern Vermont College that year. Castleton collaborates with Vermont Technical College in the nursing program, whose offices are housed in the Bjur Building (otherwise known as the Vermont Mill). ==Castleton Polling Institute== In 2012, Castleton began the Castleton Polling Institute with an initial investment of $100,000. The first poll was conducted from February 11 to February 22, 2012 and polled Vermont voters about the 2012 Presidential Primaries. Since the first poll, the Polling Institute has conducted over 30 public opinion and public policy polls for state agencies, non-profits, and media organizations. The Institute's founding director, Rich Clark, is a professor of political science and had been working in academia and polling for 15 years before coming to Castleton in 2011 from the University of Georgia. ==Gallery== Castleton state college Woodruff Hall.jpgWoodruff Hall Castleton Vermont 20040701.jpgBuilt in 1821, Old Chapel (Castleton Medical College Building) is the oldest building on the Castleton campus. ==Athletics== The Castleton State Spartans compete in 20 NCAA Division III varsity sports in the Little East Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Castleton was also the 1963 NAIA Division III Men's soccer National Champions. From 1983-1986, Stan Van Gundy (later head coach of the Orlando Magic and the Detroit Pistons) coached Men's Basketball at Castleton. Castleton started a football team for the 2009 season as a member of the newly formed Eastern Collegiate Football Conference. Castleton's men's soccer team were declared 1963 NAIA co-champions (along with Earlham College of Indiana) after the championship and consolation games at Frostburg State University, Maryland were cancelled due to snow. The men's and women's Castleton Spartans hockey teams compete at the Spartan Arena in the Diamond Run Mall in Rutland. The Castleton Spartans football team represents the school in NCAA Division III college football. The team has been coached by Tony Volpone since 2014. Volpone replaced Marc Klatt, who resigned in December 2013. It has been part of the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference since its inaugural season in 2009. ==Notable alumni== *Chad Bentz, baseball player *Arthur P.

Ordered prior to World War I to support the Australian submarines AE1 and AE2, Platypus was not completed until after both submarines had been lost, and she was commissioned into the Royal Navy from 1917 to 1919. After the RAN acquired six J class submarines, Platypus was recommissioned as an Australian warship. She was repurposed as a destroyer tender after the J class was removed from service in the 1920s, tasked with supporting the two O class submarines during 1929 and 1930. After the submarines were placed in reserve, Platypus was renamed HMAS Penguin and operated as a depot ship until 1941. The ship assumed her old name and was relocated to Darwin, then Cairns for use as a base ship. After a refit in 1944, Platypus operated as a repair vessel in New Guinea waters until she was placed into reserve in 1946. Platypus was sold for scrap in 1958. ==Construction and acquisition== Platypus was ordered by the Australian government before the outbreak of the war to service the new E class submarines, AE1 and AE2. She was built by John Brown and Company at Clydebank in Scotland, and launched on 28 October 1916. By the time she was completed, both submarines had been lost, and she was instead commissioned into the Royal Navy on 21 March 1917. ==Operational historyRoyal Navy=== At the conclusion of the war, the ship was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy and was commissioned into the RAN on 25 March 1919. ===Royal Australian Navy=== Platypus’s main role was to support the RAN's six J class submarines, which she sailed with from Britain to Sydney between April and July 1919. Platypus and all six J class submarines were based at Geelong in February 1920. Due to the poor condition of the submarines and financial pressure on the RAN the Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service was disbanded in May 1922 and Platypus was redesignated as a destroyer tender. Platypus reverted to her original role as a submarine tender in 1929 when the RAN acquired two O class submarines but was used as a depot ship after these submarines were placed into reserve in 1930. She was renamed HMAS Penguin on 15 August 1930. In October 1932, a mutiny occurred aboard Penguin.Frame & Baker, Mutiny, p. 126 The mutiny was in protest of the decreases in sailor pay and conditions: Depression-era cutbacks had impacted them harder than officers, as they had no avenues of protest. The ship's commanding officer was sympathetic, promising that he would forward their concerns to the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (which refused to consider them) and that they would not be punished. She continued as a depot ship until 26 February 1941 when she was renamed HMAS Platypus and returned to seagoing service as a training ship. In May 1941, Platypus sailed to Darwin to serve as a base ship. She survived the Japanese attack on Darwin in February 1942 and remained at Darwin until January 1943 when she sailed to Cairns, Queensland where she again served as a base ship until May 1944. In June 1944 Platypus received a major refit and sailed to New Guinea as a repair and maintenance vessel. She operated off New Guinea and Morotai Island until returning to Australia in December 1945. The wartime service of Platypus was later recognised with the battle honour \\"Darwin 1942-43\\". ==Decommissioning and fate== Platypus was placed into reserve on 13 May 1946, paid off on 1 November 1956 and was sold for scrap on 20 February 1958. ==References== * * ==External links== Category:Submarine depot ships of the Royal Australian Navy Category:1916 ships Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1916 in Scotland ","title":"HMAS Platypus (1917)"},{"id":"529685","text":"Three ships and two shore installations of the Royal Australian Navy have been named HMAS Penguin after the aquatic, flightless bird: * , a composite sloop originally commissioned by the Royal Navy, before being transferred to the RAN in 1913 as a depot ship * HMAS Penguin, a second-class protected cruiser, , that was renamed Penguin in 1923 when it was converted to accommodations * HMAS Penguin, a submarine depot ship HMS Platypus built for the Royal Navy before transferring to the RAN as in 1919 and renamed Penguin in 1929.

Wireless Ridge was one of seven strategic hills within five miles of Stanley at that had to be taken in order for the Island's capital to be approached. The attack was successful, and the entire Argentine force on the Islands surrendered later that day. The British force consisted of 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (2 Para), a troop of the Blues & Royals, with two FV101 Scorpion and two FV107 Scimitar light tanks, as well as artillery support from two batteries of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and naval gunfire support provided by 's 4.5-in gun. The Argentine force consisted of the 7th Infantry Regiment as well as detachments from other units. The first Argentine unit to arrive in the sector was that commanded by Major José Rodolfo Banetta that took up residence inside the Moody Brook Barracks,Desde El Frente Batallon De Infanteria De Marina Nº 5, Carlos H. Robacio, Carlos Hugo Robacio, Jorge Hernández, p. 216, Centro Naval, Instituto de Publicaciones Navales, 01/01/1996 but this unit had to evacuate the area on 11 June when British fire struck the building, killing three conscripts and wounding the Argentine major. At first, the 7th Regiment on Wireless Ridge was relatively comfortable, shooting sheep and roasting them on old bed frames the soldiers had found nearby. Private Guillermo Vélez maintains that he personally shot and killed 50 sheep during his time on Wireless Ridge.Daniel Kon, p. 24, Los Chicos de la Guerra: Hablan los soldados que estuvieron en Malvinas, Galerna, 1982 ==Background== After heavy losses during the Battle of Goose Green, including their commander, Lieutenant Colonel 'H' Jones, command of 2 Para passed to Lieutenant-Colonel David Chaundler, who was in England at the time of the battle. Chaundler flew to Ascension Island on a Vickers VC10 and then to the Falklands on a C-130 Hercules that was dropping supplies by parachute. Chaundler jumped into the sea, where he was picked up by helicopter and eventually delivered to for a briefing with Admiral Sandy Woodward and then to Major General Jeremy Moore's headquarters. Four days after Goose Green, Chaundler joined 2 Para. After debriefing the battalion's officers about Goose Green and the events following, he vowed that the unit would never again go into action without fire support. From Fitzroy, 2 Para were moved by helicopter to Bluff Cove Peak where they were held in reserve. The first line of hills: Two Sisters, Mount Longdon and Mount Harriet, were taken. Three other hills were then slated to be captured: Mount Tumbledown by the Scots Guards, Mount William by the Gurkhas and Wireless Ridge by 2 Para. The final phase of 3 Commando Brigade's campaign, the battle for Stanley, would follow the capture of these hills. On the morning of 13 June, it became clear that the attacks on Tumbledown had been successful, so 2 Para marched around the back of Mount Longdon to take up their positions for the assault on Wireless Ridge. As the action was expected to be concluded quickly, they took only their weapons and as much ammunition as possible, leaving most other gear behind in the camp. On Bluff Cove Peak, the Battalion's mortars and heavy machine guns were attacked by Argentine A-4 Skyhawks, which delayed their planned move forward, although they suffered no casualties. ==Initial assault== Final Actions, 13 to 14 June 1982 In the closing hours of 13 June, D Company (Coy) began the attack sequence, advancing upon 'Rough Diamond' hill north-west of Mount Longdon. It had been hit by an intense barrage from British guns, from land and sea. In the softening-up bombardment, British artillery had fired 6,000 rounds with their 105 mm pieces, and as the British paratroopers began their push, they were further backed by naval fire and the 76 and 30 mm guns mounted on the light tanks. The approximately 80 casualties sustained by 2 Para two weeks earlier at the Battle of Goose Green (including the loss of their commanding officer), had induced them not to take any unnecessary chances the second time around. The Argentine commanding officer, Lt.Col. Omar Giménez, says that three or four times he was nearly killed by a direct hit during the softening-up bombardment. \\"Cuando volví parecía un delincuente\\" When D Coy reached the hill, they found that the Argentine compañía C of the 7th Infantry Regiment had withdrawn due to the heavy bombardment. As Major Philip Neame's D Coy started to consolidate their position, the Argentine 7th Regiment launched a series of heavy recoilless rifle, rocket and mortar attacks on Mount Longdon, causing casualties to the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (3 Para). With this massive fire support, A and B Coys were convinced the enemy on the 'Apple Pie' feature had been defeated, and began to advance confidently, but they met fierce resistance when they left their trenches. They came under heavy machine-gun fire; massive retaliation was initiated by the British machine-gunners and the guns of the Blues and Royals light tanks. One Mount Longdon survivor from 3 Para recalled the British attack which was initially repulsed by the Argentines: The Argentine defenders there eventually withdrew in the face of such withering fire, and A and B Coys took their objective. By this stage of the battle, there were not many experienced Argentine officers left; the Forward Artillery Observation Officer (Major Guillermo Nani), the Operations Officer (Captain Carlos Ferreyra) and the compañía A and C commanders (Captains Jorge Calvo and Hugo García) and at least three senior platoon commanders (First Lieutenants Antonio Estrada, Jorge Guidobono and Ramon Galíndez-Matienzo) were wounded. C Coy then moved down from their northern start line to advance to a position east of Wireless Ridge where they found a platoon position was unoccupied. By about 4.30am, Lieutenant-Colonel Gimenez knew that the 7th Infantry Regiment had been decisively defeated; Communications are lost, my whole regiment is finished,Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.209, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 but other attached units continued to fight. ==SAS diversionary raid== The Special Air Service, along with men from the Special Boat Squadron, attempted to carry out a diversionary raid immediately north of Port Stanley on the night of 13-14 June. The plan was, as 2 PARA attacked the northern half of Wireless Ridge, 30 SAS and SBS commandos aboard 4 Rigid Raiders would speed across the Murrell River entrance and attack the oil storage facilities on Cortley Ridge. However, before it could reach its objective, the assault force was illuminated by a spotlight on the Argentine Almirante Irízar hospital ship (preparing to collect Major José Ricardo Spadaro's 601 National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron on Navy PointGendarmería en Malvinas: Alacrán, un Escuadrón con justa gloriafor a major insertion behind 2 PARA)\\"Next night, they met up with the Special Forces at Blanco Bay and then, with nine soldiers to each Rigid Raider, they sped across Port William Bay, but had the misfortune to be heard by a Border Guard commando collecting supplies on board the Almirante Irízar for an Argentine special forces infiltration operation en route to Beagle Ridge to raid and direct air and 155mm artillery fire on the British rear.\\" Nine Battles to Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, p. 211, Pen & Sword Books, 1999. A massive amount of fire, including 30mm anti-aircraft guns arched down onto the SAS/SBS force from positions along the northern shore, caused the British raiders to withdraw. Three British commandos were wounded and all the Rigid Raiders involved were damaged beyond repair. ==Final assault== Led by Captain Rodrigo Alejandro Soloaga, two platoons (under Lieutenant Luis Bertolini and Second Lieutenant Diego Harrington) from the Argentine 10th Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (which normally operated the Panhard AML) arrived as reinforcements and took over the abandoned positions of the 7th Regiment Reconnaissance Platoon (under Lieutenant Francisco Ramón Galindez-Matienzo) in the western rocks of Wireless Ridge.During the night of 12/13 June the two dismounted cavalry platoons commanded by Lieutenant Luis Bertolini and Second Lieutenant Diego Harrington, who had been covering the road and directing the shelling of Mount Longdon, were pulled back behind Recce Platoon.Nine Battles to Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, p. 208, Pen & Sword, 2014 Maj. Philip Neame's D Coy (2 Para) then began the final assault from the western end of Wireless Ridge, under the cover of fire from 's 4.5 inch gun, four light tanks, twelve 105 mm artillery pieces, several mortars and anti-tank rockets. As the Argentine 7th Infantry absorbed the attack, Soloaga's patrol engaged British forces on \\"Apple Pie\\", including the tanks, a Milan platoon and a machine gun platoon. Over the course of two hours the 10th Squadron suffered five dead and about 50 wounded. D Coy took the first half of their objective after a hard fight with a platoon of Argentine paratroopers, led by 2nd Lt Gustavo Alberto Aimar of the 2nd Airborne Infantry Regiment. While Neame's company was able to overrun the Argentine paratroopers, wounding Aimara and several of his men, the British suffered two killed (Privates David Parr and Francis Slough) in the process. Neame's men then came under fierce attack from Maj. Guillermo Berazay's Compañía A, 3rd Regiment which had tried to move forward to Mt Longdon during the fighting two nights earlier but had only reached Moody Brook valley. With Lt José Luis Dobroevic's 81mm Mortar Platoon providing fire support, the company, in the form of the platoons of Subteniente (Sub-Lieutenant) Carlos Javier Aristegui and 2nd Lt Víctor Rodriguez-Pérez advanced to contact. Private Patricio Pérez from Aristegui's platoon, recalled the unnerving experience of 66 mm rockets coming straight at them like undulating fireballs.Bilton and Kosminsky, 1989 He believed he shot a British paratrooper, possibly 12 Platoon's commander, and became enraged when he heard that his friend, Horacio Benítez from his platoon, had been shot. According to Private Horacio Benítez from Aristegui's platoon: The platoon of 2nd Lt Rodriguez-Pérez delivered a frontal assault and in fact closed in with the British 12 Platoon, under the command of Lt Jonathan Page (following the death of Lt Barry at Goose Green). The fight surged back and forth. Lt Page managed to hold the line, but only just. Commenting later on the action, retired Major-General John Frost (who in 1944 as a lieutenant-colonel had commanded 2 Para during the Battle of Arnhem) describes the resulting attack on 12 Platoon: \\"For two very long hours the company remained under pressure. Small- arms fire mingled with all types of HE [high explosive rifle-grenades] fell in and around 12 Platoon's position as the men crouched in the abandoned enemy sangars [a type of fortification] and in shell holes.\\"Frost, 1983 According to Neame: \\"Then from the east we got this counterattack. Jon Page, whose platoon I had left up that end did a really bloody good job. He managed to get hold of our artillery by flicking his radio onto their net, as we were still without our FOO. That broke up their attack.\\"Above All, Courage: The Falklands Front Line: First-Hand Accounts, Max Arthur, p.200, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1985 Private Graham Carter from D Coy confirms that several men in Aristegui's platoon had managed to sneak into the rocks through which 12 Platoon had come earlier: \\"We were out in the open on limb, and it looked like 10 and 11 Platoons were shooting at us. We asked the OC [Neame] to come over and check our position. He bimbled across seeming oblivious to tracer all around him, then wondered back. We thought, 'silly bugger'. Then our platoon commander [Lt Jonathan Page] stood up, shouted to everyone to keep down and was knocked over himself, hit in the leg. He was screaming and shouting, but when the medic stripped him off there was no wound, just massive bruising where the round had hit his ammunition pouch.\\"The scars of war, Hugh McManners, p.186, HarperCollins, 1993 Neame's officers and NCOs rallied the men to capture the final part of their objective and in the face of heavy fire, the Argentines having run out of ammunition, broke and retreated, covered by supporting machine gun fire, controlled by Lt Horacio Alejandro Mones-Ruiz of Berazay's compañía. Privates Esteban Tríes and José Cerezuela of Rodriguez-Pérez's platoon, volunteered to stay behind and rescue their wounded platoon sergeant, Manuel Villegas, laboriously carrying him to Port Stanley.Rescatando al sargento Villegas Private Michael Savage and other survivors from Compañía C were the first 7th Regiment troops to reach the relative safety of Port Stanley, only to be greeted with shock and disdain, he recalls, by immaculately dressed staff officers: \\"They had been sleeping in houses, in warm beds. They had shiny shoes, pristine ironed uniforms and waxed moustaches. They even had heating in their cars. I was so furious with them.\\"‘You never get over it, but I have a double problem. I was fighting against Brits, people who were as good as family'. By Sophie Arie. Published on Saturday 30 March 2002. news.scotsman.com. The battle was not yet over. Lt-Col. Eugenio Dalton, an Argentine 10th Brigade staff officer, during the pre-dawn darkness of 14 June, was seen driving around in a jeep, marshalling tired, panicky and dazed soldiers from various units into a company and leading them into Stanley's western sector, under heavy fire.5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, p.30, Leo Cooper, 2003 Some 200 survivors from Wireless Ridge had been rallied by Dalton to form, under heavy gunfire, a last-ditch defensive line in front of the now silenced guns of the 4th Airborne Artillery Group near the racecourse. Near the church in Stanley, intent on helping Berazay, Maj. Carrizo-Salvadores, Second-in-command of the 7th Regiment, helped by the chaplain Father José Fernández,Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.209, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 mustered about 50 Wireless Ridge survivors and led them on a bayonet charge, with the soldiers chanting their famous 'Malvinas March', but were stopped by heavy artillery and machine-gun fire.Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War, Hugh Bicheno, p.312, Phoenix, 01/02/2007 The Paras were momentarily alarmed and watched surprised, with Neame describing it as \\"quite a sporting effort, but one without a sporting chance\\".Operation Corporate: The Falklands War, 1982, Martin Middlebrook, p.371, Viking, 1985 Neame later gave more details: \\"Then as daylight began we got another counter-attack, this time from the Moody brook side onto Sean Webster's platoon. I thought 'bloody hell, what's going on around here?' I wondered what we had got into and thought that this was most unlike the Argentinians. For a while they were quite persistent.\\"Above All, Courage: The Falklands Front Line: First-Hand Accounts, Max Arthur, p.201, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1985 2 Para had suffered three dead and 11 wounded. Its mortar platoon also reported four mortarmen with broken ankles after having fired supercharge rounds for extra range, in order to repel the Argentine counterattack force that had attacked from Moody Brook.\\"During the action at Wireless Ridge 2 PARA's mortars fired on supercharge for extra range and the teams had been forced to improvise to prevent the baseplates from sinking into the peat. Another problem was that the tubes would occasionally jump out of the baseplates on recoil. To prevent this, team members took it in turns to stand on the baseplates, but the shock was so great that four of them had suffered broken angles by the end of the battle.\\" Task Force: The Illustrated History of the Falklands War, David Reynolds, p. 239, Sutton, 2002The Argentines suffered approximately 25 dead and about 125 wounded, about 50 were taken prisoner. In the final stages of the battle, Brigadier-General Jofre had been offered the use of Skyhawks to bomb Wireless Ridge with napalm but declined in the belief that the British response would be commensurate.\\"Brigadier General Jofre had already refused an offer of Skyhawks to napalm Wireless Ridge because he believed the British response would be catastrophic\\".

In the wake of the battle, British forces witnessed the Argentine soldiers pull back toward Stanley, before continuing to turn firepower onto them as they retreated, with one officer remarking \\"It was a most pathetic sight, and one which I never wish to see again.\\" Not wanting to replicate the heavy losses of Goose Green, the British had focussed a heavy artillery bombardment onto the opposing troops before undertaking the main assault, an action that would strongly affect the morale of the Argentine soldiers. The barrage lowered their will to fight significantly, spreading a sense of hopelessness through the forces as they retreated.Landry, Chris D. (2002). British Artillery During Operation Corporate. Marine Corps University, Virginia. With the opposing forces in retreat, and the successful capture of several key positions, including Wireless Ridge and Mount Tumbledown, the British obtained permission to advance on Stanley, with 2 Para leading the first troops into the town since Argentinian forces had first occupied the territory at the beginning of the war in April 1982. After its recapture, the Argentine surrender came into effect from 14 June. For the bravery shown at Wireless Ridge, 2 Para was awarded three Military Crosses, one Military Medal and one Distinguished Conduct Medal. 29 Commando was awarded one Military Cross. ==See also== * Falklands War ==References Notes = Bibliography === * * * Jolly, Rick (1983) The red and green life machine : a diary of the Falklands Field Hospital, London: Century, * * Paul, James and Spirit, Martin (2002) Second time around for 2 Para: The Battle for Wireless Ridge, Britain's Small Wars, WWW site, Accessed 19 March 2007 ==External links== *Anglo-Argentine Alan Craig tells of fight for Wireless Ridge *recollections of Anglo-Argentine conscript Michael Savage of the 7th Infantry Regiment's C Company Wireless Ridge Category:Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom) Category:Household Cavalry Category:British Army in the Falklands War Category:June 1982 events in South America ","title":"Battle of Wireless Ridge"},{"id":"529700","text":"These are lists of Privy Counsellors of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom from the reorganisation in 1679 of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council to the present day.

The Precisionist style, which first emerged after World War I and was at the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, celebrated the new American landscape of skyscrapers, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called \\"Cubist-Realism.\\"Milton Brown, American Painting from the Armory Show to the Depression (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1955), pp. 114–115. The term \\"Precisionism\\" was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. BarrGail Stavitsky, Precisionism in America, 1915–1941: Reordering Reality (New York: Abrams, 1994), p. 21. although according to Amy Dempsey the term \\"Precisionism\\" was coined by Charles Sheeler.[Styles, schools and movements, published by Thames & Hudson 2002 Amy Dempsey] Painters working in this style were also known as the \\"Immaculates\\", which was the more commonly used term at the time.Stavitsky, p. 19. The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists. == An American movement == Charles Demuth, I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold, 1928, Metropolitan Museum of Art Influenced by Cubism and Futurism, Precisionism took for its main themes industrialisation and the modernization of the American landscape, the structures of which were depicted in precise, sharply defined geometrical forms. Precisionist artists considered themselves strictly American and some were reluctant to acknowledge their European artistic influences.Metropolitan Museum of Art Yet it was readily apparent at the time that the fracturing of planes in many Precisionist paintings originates in the Cubism of Picasso and Léger; similarly, Precisionist renderings of shafts of light as rigidly drawn \\"lines of force\\" is a clear borrowing from Futurism. In the end, Precisionism was less about pure originality of expression and more about an energetic American use and amalgamation of certain European modernist techniques. Part of precisionism's originality is found in its subject matter and outlook. There is a degree of reverence for the industrial age in the movement, but social commentary was not fundamental to the style. Like Pop Art, Precisionism has on occasion been interpreted as a criticism of the de-natured society it portrays, though its artists did not often feel comfortable with this reading of their work. Elsie Driggs' Pittsburgh (1926) illustrates this gap in perception.For a fuller discussion of Pittsburgh, see Constance Kimmerle, Elsie Driggs: The Quick and the Classical (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), pp. 31-33 and John Loughery, \\"Blending the Classical and the Modern: The Art of Elsie Driggs\\", Woman's Art Journal (Winter 1987), p 24. A painting of black and gray steel-mill smokestacks, thick piping, and crisscrossing wires, with only clouds of smoke to relieve the severity of the image, viewers have been tempted to see this dark painting as a statement of environmental concern. To the contrary, Driggs always claimed that she intended an ironic beauty in the image and referred to it as \\"my El Greco.\\" Upon seeing the painting, Charles Daniel dubbed her \\"one of the new classicists.\\"Kimmerle, p. 32. More often than not, Precisionism implicitly celebrated man-made dynamism and new technologies. Possible exceptions to this statement are some of the darker, more claustrophobic city paintings of Louis Lozowick and the comic anti-capitalist satires of Preston Dickinson. As might be expected, varying degrees of abstraction are found in Precisionist works. The Figure 5 in Gold (1928) by Charles Demuth, a clamorous hommage to William Carlos Williams' imagist poem about a fire truck is abstract and stylized, while the paintings of Charles Sheeler sometimes verge on a form of photorealism. (In addition to his meticulously detailed paintings like River Rouge Plant and American Landscape, Sheeler, like his friend Paul Strand, also created sharply focused photographs of factories and public buildings.Charles Sheeler photo, retrieved online November 9, 2008) The majority of Precisionist paintings and drawings, however, present no obstacles in identifying their imagery. Some Precisionist work tended toward a \\"highly controlled approach to technique and form\\" as well as an application of \\"hard-edged style to long- familiar American scenes\\".Metropolitan Museum of Art Precisionist artists aimed to convey the geometric and psychological essence of a scene or a structure but intended that essence to be almost immediately accessible. Most Precisionist imagery is urban: office towers, apartment houses, bridges, tunnels, subway platforms, streets, the skyline and grid of the modern city. Other artists, however, such as Charles Demuth, Niles Spencer, Ralston Crawford, Sanford Ross, and Charles Sheeler, applied the same approach to more pastoral settings and painted starkly geometric renderings of barns, cottages, country roads, and farm houses. Artists such as Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy painted Precisionist still lifes as well. ==Precisionists== Paul Strand, Wall Street, 1915 Many American artists worked in a Precisionist style over a twenty-year period. George Ault, Ralston Crawford, Francis Criss, Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Preston Dickinson, Elsie Driggs, Louis Lozowick, Gerald Murphy, Charles Sheeler, Niles Spencer, Morton Schamberg and Joseph Stella, were among the most prominent Precisionists.The New York Times, Roberta Smith, ART VIEW: Precisionism And a Few Of Its Friends\\", October 26, 2008 Examples of their work can be found in most major American museum collections. Dale Nichols, Millard Sheets,The Hilbert Museum reveals treasures of California Scene Painting, Liz Goldner, February 24, 2016 KCET https://www.kcet.org/ Virginia Berresford, Henry Billings, Peter Blume, Stefan Hirsch, Edmund Lewandowski, John Storrs, Miklos Suba, Sandor Bernath, Herman Trunk, Arnold Wiltz, Clarence Holbrook Carter, Edgar Corbridge and the photographers Paul Strand and Lewis Hine were other artists associated with Precisionism. The movement had no major presence outside the United States, although it did influence Australian art where Jeffrey Smart adopted its principles. Although no manifesto was ever created, some of the artists were friends and frequently exhibited at the same galleries. Georgia O'Keeffe, especially with paintings like New York City with Moon (1926) and The Shelton With Sun Spots (1926), created her own more sensuous version of Precisionism, although her best-known works are not closely related to Precisionism, and it would be inaccurate to state that O'Keeffe (who vehemently resisted movement ties) was closely aligned with the Precisionist movement. Her husband, photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, was a highly regarded mentor for the group and was especially supportive of Paul Strand. Precisionist art would have an indirect influence on the later styles known as magic realism, pop art, and photorealism, but it was largely considered a dated \\"period style\\" by the 1950s, though its influence on advertising imagery and stage and set design continued throughout the twentieth century. Its two most famous practitioners are Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler. ==Quotations== * \\"America is the country of the art of the future. ... Look at the skyscrapers!

The college offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs. With predecessor institutions dating to 1863, Goddard College was founded in 1938 as an experimental and non-traditional educational institution based on the idea of John Dewey that experience and education are intricately linked. Goddard College uses an intensive low-residency model. First developed for Goddard's MFA in Creative Writing Program, Goddard College operated a mix of residential, low-residency, and distance-learning programs starting in 1963 before switching to a system of 100% low-residency programs with the closure of its Residential Undergraduate Program in 2002. In most programs, each student designs their own curriculum and the college uses a student self- directed, mentored system in which faculty issue narrative evaluations of students' progress as they fulfill their program's degree criteria. Goddard offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Master of Arts (MA), Master of Fine Arts (MFA), along with several concentrations and Licensures. It enrolls approximately 700 students, 30% of whom are undergraduates. It employs 110 faculty and 90 staff. Goddard College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. ==History== Goddard College began in 1863 in Barre, Vermont, as the Green Mountain Central Institute. In 1870, it was renamed Goddard Seminary in honor of Thomas A. Goddard (1811–1868) and his wife Mary (1816–1889). Goddard was a prominent merchant in Boston, and was one of the school's earliest and most generous benefactors. Founded by Universalists, Goddard Seminary was a four-year preparatory high school, primarily for Tufts College. For many years the Seminary prospered. But the opening of many good public high schools in the 20th century made many of the New England academies obsolete. To attempt to save it, the trustees added a Junior College to the Seminary in 1935, with a Seminary graduate, Royce S. \\"Tim\\" Pitkin, as President. Royce S. \\"Tim\\" Pitkin, President of Goddard College for 31 years. Royce S. \\"Tim\\" Pitkin was a progressive educator and follower of John Dewey, William Heard Kilpatrick and other, similar proponents of educational democracy. In 1936, under his leadership, the Seminary concluded that in order for Goddard to survive, an entirely new institution would need to be created. A number of prominent educators and laymen agreed with him. Pitkin was supported by Stanley C. Wilson, ex-governor of Vermont and chairman of the Goddard Seminary Board of Trustees; Senators George Aiken and Ralph Flanders and Dorothy Canfield Fisher. Pitkin was able to persuade the Board of Trustees to embrace a new style of education, one that substituted individual attention, democracy, and informality for the traditionally austere and autocratic educational model. On March 13, 1938, Goddard College was chartered. In July 1938 the newly formed Goddard College moved to Greatwood Farm in Plainfield, Vermont. The new Goddard was an experimental and progressive college. For its first 21 years of operation, Goddard was unaccredited and small, but built a reputation as one of the most innovative colleges in the country. Especially noteworthy were Goddard's use of discussion as the basic method in classroom teaching; its emphasis on the whole lives of students in determining personal curricula; its incorporation of practical work into the life of every student; and its development of the college as a self-governing learning community in which everyone had a voice. In 1959 Goddard College became accredited. As of 2018, it is accredited on probation by the New England Commission of Higher Education.Goddard accreditation statement Retrieved 15 February 2015 One of the founding principles of Goddard was that it should provide educational opportunities for adults. There was a great need for a program for adults who had not completed college, to obtain degrees without disrupting their family lives or careers. The Adult Degree Program (ADP), created by Evalyn Bates, was established in 1963. It was the first low-residency adult education program in the country. Over the years many experimental programs were designed at Goddard. These programs included the Goddard Experimental Program for Further Education, Design Build Program, Goddard Cambridge Program for Social Change, Third World Studies Program, Institute for Social Ecology, Single Parent Program and many others. Having narrative transcripts instead of traditional letter grades, as well as learner-designed curricula, Goddard was one of the founding members of the Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities, which also included Franconia, Nasson, Antioch, and others. In 2002, after 54 years, the college terminated its residential undergraduate degree program and became an exclusively low-residency college. Three years later, the college expanded to the West Coast and established a residency site in Port Townsend, Washington. In July 2011 Goddard began to offer their education program (non- licensure only) in Seattle, Washington. ==CampusesMain campus, Greatwood: Plainfield, Vermont=== The campus in Plainfield was founded in 1938 on the grounds of a late 19th-century model farm: The Greatwood Farm & Estate consists of shingle style buildings and gardens designed by Arthur Shurcliff. The Village of Learning, consisting of eleven dormitory buildings, was constructed adjacent to the ensemble of renovated farm buildings in 1963 to accommodate an increasing student population. The Pratt Center & Library, sited to be at the heart of a larger campus, was constructed in 1968. No other significant new construction has been added to the campus since that time. On March 7, 1996 the Greatwood campus was recognized for its historic and architectural significance with its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. ===Fort Worden State Park, Port Townsend, Washington campus=== A US Army post from 1902 to 1953,Fort Worden much of the fort has been renovated and turned into a year-round, multi-use facility dedicated to lifelong learning which houses several organizations that comprise Fort Worden State Park. The fort sits on a bluff overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Admiralty Inlet near Port Townsend, Washington. ===Columbia City, Seattle campus=== The MA in Education program, originally held in the Plainfield-based low-residency program, expanded into Columbia City, one of Seattle's most ethnically and racially diverse neighborhoods, in 2011. The program is unique in that it trains students in bilingual preschool education. Students can focus on such areas as intercultural studies, dual language, early childhood, cultural arts, and community education, and then create their plan of studies for each semester. The program is also different in that it is designed to serve students who cannot leave their families and communities for the residency. The “community campus” is housed in different buildings in the area. ==Academics== Each Goddard student designs their own curriculum in accordance with their program's degree criteria. In addition to fulfilling academic criteria in the subjects of the arts, the humanities, mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences, undergraduate students must also demonstrate critical thinking and writing, understanding of social and ecological contexts, positive self-development and thoughtful action within their learning processes. The college uses a student self-directed, mentored system in which faculty issue narrative evaluations of student's progress instead of grades. The intensive low-residency model requires that students come to campus every six months for approximately eight days when students engage in a variety of activities and lectures from early morning until late in the evening and create detailed study plans. During the semester, students study independently, sending in \\"packets\\" to their faculty mentors every few weeks. When low-residency education began at Goddard, packets were actual packets of paper sent via the mail, but with the advancement of the internet, most packets are sent electronically and may contain artwork, audio files, photography, video and web pages in addition to writing. The schedule and format of these packets differ from program to program, and content varies with each student-faculty correspondence, but almost always focuses on research, writing, and reflection related to each student's individualized study plan. At regular intervals students compile their work into \\"learning portfolios\\" to submit as part of a Progress Review before a cross-program board of faculty who track that all students' work is in compliance with the college's degree criteria. Undergraduates must then complete a yearlong Senior Study, accompanied by final graduating presentations of work, before being award a degree. ==FacilitiesThe Eliot D. Pratt Center and Library=== The Eliot D. Pratt Center and Library, located in Plainfield, Vermont serves the entire Goddard College community, and is open to the public. Its holdings contain over 70,000 physical items and access to over 20 electronic databases. The building also houses several administrative offices, an Archives room with artifacts from the 1800s to present, an Art Gallery, and WGDR (91.1 FM), a college/community radio station serving Central Vermont since 1973. ===Goddard College Community Radio (WGDR and WGDH)=== Goddard is home to Goddard College Community Radio, a community-based, non-commercial, listener-supported educational radio station with nearly 70 volunteer programmers who live and work in central and northern Vermont and who range in age from 12 to 78 years. WGDR, 91.1 FM, is licensed to Plainfield, Vermont. Its sister station, WGDH, 91.7 FM, is licensed to Hardwick, Vermont. Goddard College Community Radio is the largest non-commercial community radio station in Vermont and is the only non-commercial station in the state other than the statewide Vermont Public Radio network that receives funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. ===Haybarn Theatre=== The Haybarn Theatre was built in 1868 by the Martin Family and was one of the largest barns in Central Vermont. The Haybarn was originally used to store hay, grain and livestock. In 1938 when Goddard College purchased Greatwood Farm they began the process of turning the farm buildings into academic and student spaces. The Haybarn was renovated in order to provide a space for the performing arts. For almost 75 years the Haybarn Theatre has been a place where the local community and the College come together to enjoy and appreciate the arts. This long tradition continues to this day as the Haybarn hosts educational conferences, student and community performances and the ongoing Goddard College Concert Series. ==Notable eventsAlternative Media Conference=== In June 1970 Goddard hosted the Alternative Media Conference which attached more than 1,600 radio DJs and others involved in independent media from all over the United States. Featured presenters included Yippee founder Jerry Rubin, spiritual leader Ram Dass, Larry Yurdin, Danny Fields, Bob Fass and Paull Krassner from The Realist. A music roster of up-and-coming bands was curated by Atlantic Records and included Dr. John and the J. Geils Band. The conference embodied both the political activism and the free-love atmosphere of the time: a coalition affiliated with the Panther 21, The Guardian, Newsreel, Radio Free People, Liberation News Service, Media Women and The New York Rat put together a packet highlighting the political side of alternative media. A second Alternative Media Conference was held on campus in 2013 to commemorate the college's 150th anniversary. ===2014 undergraduate commencement=== In 2014, the graduating class of the college's undergraduate program selected convicted murderer and Goddard alumnus Mumia Abu-Jamal as commencement speaker. Abu- Jamal, who had attended Goddard as an undergraduate in the 1970s, completed his Goddard degree from prison via mail while serving his sentence for the 1982 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner.Boyer, Dave. \\"Cop- killing ex-Black Panther to give college commencement address\\", The Washington Times, September 30, 2014. Accessed October 1, 2014. The decision to invite Abu-Jamal to speak was criticized by Faulkner's widow, US Senator Pat Toomey, the Vermont Troopers Association, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. The college's interim President, Bob Kenny, supported the right of students to select a commencement speaker of their choosing.Kolber, Samantha. \\"Mumia Abu- Jamal to Give Commencement Speech at Goddard College\\" , September 29, 2014.

Founded in 1828 by John Chesamore, in 2018 it was merged with the former Lyndon State College to create Northern Vermont University. == History and governance == William Samuel Johnson (1727-1819), American jurist, statesman and educator. Both the college and the town are named for him. Painted by Gilbert Stuart. Both the college, and the town of Johnson are named for William Samuel Johnson (1727-1819), American jurist, statesman and educator. The town of Johnson, and a part of neighboring Cambridge, Vermont together once made up the King's College Tract, a land grant chartered by King George III in 1774 for the eventual expansion of King's College in New York, today's Columbia University. Following the Declaration of Independence, and the emergence of the Vermont Republic, the town was instead granted to William Samuel Johnson by Vermont's Council of Censors in 1782. Johnson represented Connecticut in the Continental Congress, and argued for Vermont's admission to the federal Union. He later became president of Columbia University. John Chesamore founded Johnson State College as Johnson Academy, a grammar school instructing students in Greek, Latin, algebra and geometry. In 1867 the school became a Vermont state \\"normal school\\", a term based on the French école normale – a school to educate teachers. Early on Johnson embraced the ideas of learning from experience, and the role of the student in directing some part of their curriculum. The college was among the first Vermont universities to introduce electives. Through the early to mid-twentieth century Johnson emerged as a college of the liberal arts and natural sciences. A commitment to educating the whole student in an interdisciplinary manner, begun in the 1920s and 1930s, set in place a history of bringing visiting poets, playwrights, politicians, and artists to the college. That tradition continues, bringing filmmakers, political and spiritual leaders, and artists. Recent visitors to the campus include Japanese and Cuban drummers, New Orleans jazz musicians, and Buddhist monks who installed an environmental art work at Lower Pond. The original campus was built in the village of Johnson and over time, the college expanded; slowly building higher upon what is now called College Hill, finally settling upon a plateau above the village with a view of Sterling Mountain and the Sterling Mountain Range. Today the college is a part of the Vermont State Colleges, a consortium of five colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor, and Council of Presidents, each college with its own president and deans. On July 1, 2018, Johnson State College and Lyndon State College were merged, creating Northern Vermont University. ==Athletics== Johnson State College teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III. The Badgers are a member of the North Atlantic Conference (NAC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track & field, and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball. In 2018, women's triathlon was added to the varsity sports roster, representing the only NCAA institution in New England to carry women's triathlon as a varsity sport. == Philosophy and academic programs  Education by engagement === Johnson emphasizes the self-development of undergraduate students with what the college terms \\"education by engagement.\\" The student is engaged not solely on her or his degree program, but as an adult citizen with emphasis on their place in, and contribution to, their society, nation, and world. After a year of interdisciplinary study, students file a Plan of Study during the sophomore year. This becomes a guiding yet flexible road map for completion of students' degree work. Degree programs include the natural sciences, business, fine and performing arts, education, mathematics, literature, health sciences, writing and literature, and hospitality and tourism management. Precepts of Vermont educator-philosopher John Dewey (1859-1952) inform Johnson's emphasis on students' self evolution with emphasis on \\"learning by doing\\" and \\"learning by teaching.\\" The college emphasizes the individual's civic contribution to their larger society. Flags of students' home countries hang over a dining room in Stearns Hall, the student union building; from left to right: Ukraine, Austria, the U.S., Rwanda, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Norway and Sweden. === Faculty and students === The college has a faculty-student ratio of 1:14. Ninety-one percent of the college's faculty hold a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate level terminal degree in their area of instruction. Nearly 60% of undergraduate students come from Vermont, with approximately 40% coming from other U.S. states and more than a dozen nations. Graduate programs at Johnson include an M.F.A. in Studio Arts, a Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Arts in Counseling. Parts of these programs can be completed with a low residency requirement. Portions of the M.F.A. in Studio Arts program includes course work in conjunction with the Vermont Studio Center, located in the village of Johnson. ==FacilitiesThe Dibden Center for the Arts=== Named for Arthur J. Dibden, president of Johnson State College 1967-69, Dibden oversaw the expansion and development of the fine and performing arts programs. The center is located on the southwest side of the campus and houses the college's Dance, Music, and Theater programs as well as gallery exhibition space for the Fine Arts programs. The striking late modernist building, whose sculptural roofline echoes the contours of the Sterling Mountain Range–its backdrop to the south, is the work of architect Robert Burley. Burley apprenticed in the studio of Eero Saarinen. The large 500-seat Dibden Theater with a 44' proscenium stage is the centerpiece of the performing arts facilities at the center. Excellent acoustics are achieved by a system of hardwood baffles along the walls and ceilings. Practice and instruction rooms wrap around the theater and the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery on the front of the center showcases exhibitions of fine art and design by the college's fine art students as well as travelling exhibitions and the work of visiting artists. The Dibden Center for the Arts houses the faculties of the Department of Music and the Department of Theater, a recording studio, music studios, practice rooms, classrooms and a piano laboratory. Recitals and concerts, theater and contemporary dance performances, and open rehearsals bring performing arts into the daily life of the college. The Vermont Symphony Orchestra performs regularly at the center. Several performing arts series available to the college community, are also available to the public by subscription. The Dibden Center is an important fine and performing arts venue for all of Vermont. One of the best aspects of Dibden is the fact that it is fully student run, both working Front of House and backstage, so there is always learning and working opportunity for students that seek work opportunities and those who would like to learn more about the theater. The new Library and Learning Center in the main quadrangle's northwest corner. The LLC building, is home to the Department of Humanities, and the Department of Writing and Literature. ===Library and Learning Center=== Johnson's Library and Learning Center (LLC) opened in 1996 and incorporates the collections of the older John Dewey Library with expanded collections and new technology. The print collection includes 130,000+ volumes and over 700 journals and periodicals. The LLC houses the largest collections of fine arts publications in Vermont and is a designated National Archives and Records Administration repository. The contemporary, green design building makes use of passive and active solar heating. Its south-southwest orintetation for reading rooms utilizes natural light. The LLC is built of terra cotta brick, Vermont gray granite, Vermont blue-gray slate, steel, and green-tinted glass. The LLC was designed by the architectural firm of Gossens Bachman Architects and has won numerous awards for its architecture and environmental efficiency. Awards include the 1997 American Institute of Architects (AIA) Vermont \\"Excellence in Architecture Award.\\" The LLC also houses the faculties of the Department of Humanities, and the Department of Writing and Literature. A skybrige links the LLC with Wilson Bentley Hall. The LLC has become a community centerpiece and serves as a gateway to the northwest side of the quadrangle. An informal outdoor amphitheater facing the quadrangle has become a popular outdoor social area in warmer weather. ===John Dewey Hall === John Dewey Hall on the south side of the quadrangle was built in 1963 in the International Style; to house the college's library. It is named for the philosopher and educator John Dewey. The building is lit by natural light from a panoramic glass clerestory around the perimeter of the building. Today the building houses the college bookstore, the office of the Dean of Students, the Student Association, the Registration and Advising Center, TRIO, academic advising, and career & internship offices. ===Visual Arts Center=== Johnson's Visual Arts Center (VAC) houses the college's Visual Arts Programs, which was renovated in 2012, with studios for design, drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture, ceramics and woodworking. The Digital Imaging Laboratory (DIL) is also located here with state-of-the-art oversized high-resolution laser CMYK and Inkjet printers. The VAC augments exhibition space at the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery in the Dibden Center with a gallery for exhibiting works in progress and student projects. Exhibitions play a major role in both academic and student life at Johnson. Students have opportunities to show their work beginning in their freshman year. Exhibition programs support and expand the studio curriculum, providing students with frequent opportunities to share their work and receive input; and, by exhibiting faculty and visiting artists' work, providing insights into teachers’ approaches to making art and critique. Exhibitions in many mediums both of work produced within the college, and by work exhibited by visiting artists exposes students to a wide range of contemporary thinking and art- making methods. Fine arts majors in the freshman and sophomore levels most commonly exhibit work in the VAC. Students in their junior and senior years, especially those presenting thesis level work exhibit in the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery at the Dibden Center for the Arts. Johnson's science building is named for the Vermont scientist-artist Wilson Bentley, who photographed snowflakes using a bellows camera. Bentley Hall with the Sterling Mountain Range in the background. ===Wilson Bentley Science Hall=== Named for the scientist-artist, Wilson Bentley (1865–1931) who first photographed snowflakes in the nineteenth century in nearby Jericho, Vermont. Bentley brought an objective scientific eye to the examination of snow and ice crystals via hugely magnified images called photomicrographs. Bentley published a monograph titled Snow Crystals which documented more than 2000 snowflakes and ice crystals. Wilson Bentley Hall, designed by noted architect Robert Burley, houses the faculties of the Department of Mathematics, and the Department of Environmental and Health Sciences. A 200-seat lecture hall with digital projection facilities, an interactive television studio, and laboratories for biology, chemistry, physical sciences, cartography, and geographic information systems. Bentley Hall also houses a state-of-the-art interactive multimedia computer laboratory and is a designated National Science Foundation research facility. The building also houses a meteorological station, and green house. ===The Babcock Nature Preserve=== The Babcock Nature Preserve, located ten miles from Johnson in Eden, Vermont is a 1,000 acre (4 km²) tract of forest land owned and maintained by the college for scientific and educational study. A large, environmentally significant bog, and three large ponds dominate the physical landscape. The Babcock Nature Preserve is a natural laboratory for field biology, ornithology and environmental sciences courses. The summer field program at the Babcock Nature Preserve features a number of intensive courses designed to provide field experience in the environmental and natural sciences. == Notable alumni == * Susan Bartlett, former member of the Vermont Senate from the Lamoille district *Vernon A.

The \\"Elseworlds\\" name was trademarked in 1989, the same year as the first Elseworlds publication. ==HistoryImaginary Stories=== From 1942 to the mid-1980s, particularly during the 1960s — the era of the Silver Age of Comic Books — DC Comics began to make a distinction between the continuity of its fictional universe and stories with plots that did not fit that continuity. These out-of-continuity stories eventually came to be called Imaginary Stories. The title page of \\"Superman, Cartoon Hero!\\"Superman #183 (January 1966) (a slightly retooled reprint of 1942's \\"Superman, Matinee Idol\\"),Superman #19 (Nov-Dec. 1942) stated that the story was \\"Our first imaginary story\\", and continued to say: \\"In 1942, a series of Superman shorts started showing throughout the U.S.! So, with tongue firmly in cheek, the DC team turned out this story of what might have happened if Lois Lane had decided to see... Superman, Cartoon Hero!\\" The story opens with Lois determined to learn Superman's secret identity and going to the theater to see the Max Fleisher Superman short \\"Mad Scientist\\" in hopes of seeing the animated Man of Steel reveal his secret identity. In addition to other things, when the opening credits roll and state that the cartoons are based on DC Comics, Lois Lane states that she has never heard of DC Comics. Clark Kent then wonders if the people there are clairvoyant. In the final panel, Clark Kent exchanges a knowing wink with the image of himself as Superman on the movie screen.Superman #183 (Jan. 1966) In Action Comics #60 (May 1943), \\"Lois Lane — Superwoman!\\" told the story of Lois gaining superpowers from a transfusion of Superman's blood; while this is explicitly a dream sequence, it has been called \\"a forerunner of what would be known as 'Imaginary Stories'\\". Craig Shutt, author of the Comics Buyer's Guide column Ask Mr. Silver Age, states that true imaginary stories differed from stories that were dreams and hoaxes. Dreams and hoaxes were \\"gyps\\" on account of \\"not having happened\\", whilst true imaginary stories were canonical at least unto themselves. Also, since they were \\"just\\" imaginary and thus had no bearing on the characters’ regular stories, imaginary stories could show things like people dying and the victory of evil. In the optimistic and hopeful Silver Age of Comics, such stories usually would not be told; this was hinted with writers telling readers how such an Imaginary Story often reassured the readers that it did not really happen. Most of these Imaginary Stories featured alternate histories of characters, such as \\"The Amazing Story of Superman-Red and Superman Blue!\\". There, readers saw possible pasts that could have happened, but did not happen. One such story has Superman being raised by apes in imitation of Tarzan, an idea that would be recycled into a later Elseworlds tale where Tarzan and Superman were switched at birth. Possible present times were shown, such as one story where Jonathan and Martha Kent, touched by pity, adopt a recently orphaned Bruce Wayne and raise him along with their own son, Clark. Thus, the present shows Superman and Batman as brothers, with Clark protecting Gotham and working for the Gotham Gazette instead of living in Metropolis, and Batman inviting his foster parents, the Kents, to live with him in Wayne Manor. In keeping with the fact that imaginary stories allowed for much grimmer stories than usual, the story ended with Lex Luthor killing the Kents and Batman trying to murder him in revenge. Possible futures that \\"could very well happen\\" were explored, such as Clark Kent revealing to Lois Lane his secret identity and marrying her. Futures that \\"perhaps never will\\" happen were also examined, such as the permanent death of Superman. Imaginary Stories appeared often enough that some comics – such as Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #15 (February 1960), the cover of which appears to depict Superman marrying Lois Lane – had to assure readers that their contents were not \\"imaginary\\". The cover of Lois Lane #59 (August 1965), by contrast, promised that its depiction of Lois as the romantic rival of Lara, Jor-El's girlfriend and future mother of Superman, was \\"real--not imaginary!\\". A few Imaginary Stories appeared in other DC publications. Batman editor Jack Schiff supervised stories in which the Dark Knight starts a family or loses his identity, though these were revealed at the end of the story to be stories written by Alfred.Batman #131 (April 1960)Batman #135 (Oct. 1960) Schiff's stories were notable for the first appearance of the original Bruce Wayne Junior. Writer/editor Robert Kanigher supervised Wonder Woman's own series of Imaginary Stories called Impossible Tales which featured the same principle. There, Wonder Woman appeared along with her younger selves, Wonder Girl and Wonder Tot. However, the majority of Imaginary Stories were published in various Superman comics under the guidance of Superman editor Mort Weisinger, the \\"King of Imaginary Stories\\". This was in part because, according to Shutt, Weisinger aimed for younger readers instead of older ones. Later editors such as Julius Schwartz rarely used the Imaginary Stories concept. Alan Moore's \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\" two-part story in Superman #423 and Action Comics #583 in 1986 was the last Pre-Crisis story to use the Imaginary Stories label. ===Elseworlds imprint=== The first Elseworlds title was Gotham by Gaslight (1989), written by Brian Augustyn and drawn by Mike Mignola, which featured a Victorian Age version of the superhero Batman hunting Jack the Ripper, who had come to Gotham City. The title was not originally published as an Elseworlds comic, but its success led to the creation of the Elseworlds imprint and this title was retroactively declared the first Elseworlds story. The first book to feature the Elseworlds logo was Batman: Holy Terror in 1991. In 1994, the Elseworlds imprint was used as the theme for the annual edition comic books of that summer. DC sporadically published various Elseworlds titles from 1989 to 2003. In August 2003, editor Mike Carlin mentioned that DC had scaled back the production of Elseworlds books in order to \\"put the luster back on them.\\" Several titles that were announced as Elseworlds books prior to this, such as Superman & Batman: Generations IV and The Teen Titans Swingin' Elseworlds Special, were cancelled. The planned Teen Titans tale was released in January 2008 as the Teen Titans Lost Annual. In September 2009, Dan DiDio revealed the return of the Elseworlds imprint as a series of Prestige Format books, with the approach of taking the basic concepts and origins of DC characters and twisting them in various ways. The only Elseworlds story released under the initiative was the three-issue miniseries Superman: The Last Family of Krypton, published from August to October 2010, which told the story of baby Kal-El reaching Earth with his mother and father and how the world handles the emergence of a superpowered family. Relationship to DC continuity Although the Elseworlds imprint was created to feature stories separate from DC continuity, concepts from various Elseworlds stories were incorporated into DC continuity at various times. The Kingdom miniseries in 1999 brought the 1996 Kingdom Come miniseries into DC continuity as part of a series of alternate timelines known as Hypertime, which included some of the alternate worlds depicted in various Elseworlds titles.The Kingdom #2 (Feb. 1999) A new Multiverse was introduced at the conclusion of the 52 weekly series that includes alternate worlds that were previously seen in various Elseworlds titles.52 Week Fifty-Two (May 2007) ==In other media== The Elseworlds name was used as the title for the fifth crossover in the Arrowverse franchise, which aired from December 9 to December 11, 2018 on The CW. The crossover was told across episodes of The Flash, Arrow and Supergirl and introduced Batwoman, Gotham City, Nora Fries, and Lois Lane to the Arrowverse. ==See also== * What If – Marvel Comics' similar non-canon comic book line * Intercompany crossover * List of Elseworlds publications ==References== ==External links== * Category:Comics about parallel universes Category:Continuity (fiction) Category:DC Comics imprints ","title":"Elseworlds"},{"id":"529758","text":"Victor Olegovich Pelevin (, born 22 November 1962) is a Russian fiction writer, the author of novels Omon Ra, Chapayev and Void, and Generation P. He is a laureate of multiple literary awards including the Russian Little Booker Prize (1993) and the Russian National Bestseller (2004). His books are multi- layered postmodernist texts fusing elements of pop culture and esoteric philosophies while carrying conventions of the science fiction genre. Some critics relate his prose to the New Sincerity literary movement.Victor Pelevin on This Is Like == Biography == Victor Olegovich Pelevin was born in Moscow on 22 November 1962 to Zinaida Semenovna Efremova, an English teacher, and Oleg Anatolyevich Pelevin, a teacher at the military department of Bauman University. He lived on Tverskoy Boulevard in Moscow, later moving to Chertanovo. In 1979 Pelevin graduated from an elite high school with a special English program located on Stanislavskogo Street in the centre of Moscow, now Kaptsov Gymnasium #1520. He then attended the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) graduating with a degree in electromechanical engineering in 1985. In April of that year MPEI Department of Electrical Transport hired him as engineer. Pelevin served in the Russian Air Force. From 1987 to 1989 Pelevin attended the MPEI graduate school. Pelevin is often in the east. He has been to Nepal, South Korea, China and Japan. While he does not call himself a Buddhist, he is engaged in Buddhist practices. Pelevin has repeatedly said that despite the fact that his characters use drugs, he is not an addict even though he has experimented with mind-expanding substances in his youth. Pelevin is not married. As of the beginning of the 2000s, he lived in Australia. ==Literary career== In 1989 Pelevin attended Mikhail Lobanov's creative writing seminar at Maxim Gorky Literary Institute. While studying at the Institute Pelevin met the young novelist Albert Egazarov and the poet Victor Kulle, later a literary critic. Pelevin was expelled from the Institute in 1991. Egazarov and Kulle went on to found a publishing house, first called The Day, then The Raven and Myth, for which Pelevin has edited three volumes of Carlos Castaneda's work. From 1989 to 1990 Pelevin worked as a staff reporter of the magazine Face to Face. In 1989 he also began to work in the journal Nauka i Religiya (Science and Religion), where he edited a series of articles on eastern mysticism. In 1989 Nauka i Religiya published Pelevin's first short story \\"Ignat the Sorcerer and the People\\". In 1992 Pelevin published his first collection of stories The Blue Lantern. A year later it received the Russian Little Booker Prize. In 1994 it received InterPressCon and the Bronze Snail awards. In March 1992 Pelevin published his first novel Omon Ra in the literary journal Znamya. The novel attracted the attention of literary critics and was nominated for the Booker Prize. In April 1993, the same journal published Pelevin's next novel The Life of Insects. In 1993 Pelevin published an essay \\"John Fowles and the tragedy of Russian liberalism\\" in Nezavisimaya Gazeta. The essay was the writer's answer to some negative critics reaction to his work. In the same year Pelevin was admitted to the Russian Union of Journalists. In 1996, Pelevin participated in the International Writing Program residency at the University of Iowa. That same year, Znamya published Pelevin's novel Chapayev and Void. Critics called it \\"the first Zen Buddhist novel in Russian\\". The writer himself called it \\"the first novel which takes place in an absolute vacuum\\". In 1997 the novel won Russia's Strannik Award for science fiction, and in 2001 it was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award. In 1999, Pelevin's novel Generation P was published. Over 3.5 million copies have been sold worldwide. The book received a number of awards including Germany's Richard Schoenfeld prize. In 2003 Pelevin published the novel The Dialectics of Transition Period from Out of Nowhere to Nowhere or DTP (NN), receiving the Apollon Grigoryev Prize in 2003 and the National Bestseller award in 2004. DTP (NN) was also shortlisted for the Andrei Bely Prize in 2003. In 2006 Eksmo published Pelevin's novel Empire V. The novel was shortlisted for the Russian Big Book award. The text of Empire V appeared on the Internet even before the publication of the novel. Representatives of Eksmo claimed that it was a result of a theft, but some speculated that it was a marketing ploy. In October 2009 the novel t was published. The author received the third award of the fifth season of the Big Book award (2009-2010) and won the reader choice vote. In December 2011, Eksmo released Pelevin's novel S.N.U.F.F. which received the E-book award for \\"Prose of the Year\\" in February 2012. Literary critics have noted Pelevin's postmodernist and absurdist styles, which incorporate Buddhist motifs, esoteric traditions, and satirical science fiction. Pelevin's books have been translated into many languages including Japanese and Chinese. According to a French magazine, Pelevin is among the 1,000 most significant people in the contemporary culture. A 2009 OpenSpace.ru survey voted Pelevin as the most influential intellectual in Russia. Pelevin is known for not being a part of the literary crowd, rarely appearing in public or giving interviews and preferring to communicate on the internet. When he gives interviews he talks more about the nature of mind rather than his writings. This has given grounds to various rumors. For instance, it has been suggested that the writer does not exist and Pelevin is actually a code name for a group of authors or even a computer. The journalist Alexander Gordon is one of the people who has questioned the very existence of the writer Pelevin. In May 2011 it was reported that Pelevin would personally attend the award ceremony SuperNatsBest, which would have been the writer's first appearance in public. However, he did not come. Pelevin has permitted all of his texts in Russian predating 2009 (except P5) to be published on the Internet for non-commercial use. Some novels are also available as audio files in Russian. ==Literary style== Pelevin's prose is usually devoid of dialogue between the author and the reader, whether through plot, character development, literary form or narrative language. This corresponds to his philosophy (both stated and unstated) that, for the most part, it is the reader who infuses the text with meaning. Typical of Pelevin's ironic style, the novel Babylon (\\"Generation П\\" or \\"Generation P\\" is the Russian title) bears on its cover the inscription, \\"Any thought that occurs in the process of reading this book is subject to copyright. Unauthorized thinking of it is prohibited\\". In a conversation with BOMB Magazine, Pelevin named Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita as an early influence on his reading, saying, \\"The effect of this book was really fantastic. [...] This book was totally out of the Soviet world.\\" Pelevin avoids, however, listing authors who have specifically influenced his writing, for he believes that \\"the only real Russian literary tradition is to write good books in a way nobody did before.\\"Kropywiansky, Leo. \\"Victor Pelevin\\".

Around 1824, ex-convict Mary Reibey applied for a land grant in the Burrier area, on the southern side of the Shoalhaven River. The Nowra township was officially recognised in 1852. Less than ten years later, in 1861, a postal service was established. Also in that year, the racehorse 'Archer', trained in Nowra by Etienne de Mestre, won the first Melbourne Cup. By 1885, Nowra was declared a town.\\"Nowra Police Station \\". NSW Police Regions and History.

The sandstone house features timber verandahs and is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/162 == Heritage listings == Nowra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Pleasant Way: Graham Lodge * 35 West Street: Meroogal * 49 Journal Street: Roseville ==Geography== Nowra is on the Shoalhaven River, which formerly hosted the Australian National wakeboarding championships and is a popular fishing location. The river divides Nowra from Bomaderry and North Nowra, and is bridged by the historic Nowra Bridge. The Shoalhaven River is a salt water river, although the river itself does not flow into the sea. The Shoalhaven River meets the sea through the canal that joins the Shoalhaven and Crookhaven Rivers, which was dug by convicts under direction of local entrepreneur and pioneer Alexander Berry. It is located near Berry, Jervis Bay, Kangaroo Valley, Culburra Beach, Greenwell Point, Huskisson, Shoalhaven Heads and Cambewarra. ===Climate=== With the warmest month's mean being just 22 °C (71.6 °F), Nowra has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) under the Köppen climate classification, making it the southernmost city on the coastal strip to be within this climate zone, albeit an isolated one — nearby coastal cities to the north, such as Wollongong and Kiama, have an oceanic climate (Cfb) as their warmest month's mean does not reach the 22 °C threshold.Stern, H., de Hoedt, G. and Ernst, J. 2000.

Chinook winds , or simply Chinooks, are föhn winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges, although the original usage is in reference to wet, warm coastal winds in the Pacific Northwest.The Indian and the South Wind, p. 156 , p.157 , p.158 in J.A. Costello's Indian History of the Northwest – Siwash , 1909 The Blackfoot people term this wind \\"Snow Eater\\"; however, the more commonly used term \\"Chinook\\" originates from the language spoken by the eponymous people in the region where the usage was first derived (the Chinook people lived near the ocean, along the lower Columbia River). The reference to a wind or weather system, simply \\"a Chinook\\", originally meant a warming wind from the ocean into the interior regions of the Pacific Northwest of the US. A strong föhn wind can make snow one foot (30 cm) deep almost vanish in one day. The snow partly melts and partly sublimates in the dry wind. Chinook winds have been observed to raise winter temperature, often from below −20 °C (−4 °F) to as high as 10-20 °C (50-68 °F) for a few hours or days, then temperatures plummet to their base levels. The greatest recorded temperature change in 24 hours was caused by Chinook winds on 15 January 1972, in Loma, Montana; the temperature rose from −48 to 9 °C (−54 to 49 °F).Andrew H. Horvitz, et al. On 13 September 2002 citing a unanimous recommendation from the National Climate Extremes Committee, the Director of NCDC accepted the Loma, Montana 24 hour temperature change of 103°F, making it the new official national record. ==In Canada== Where Chinooks occur most frequently. Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada, especially in a belt from Pincher Creek and Crowsnest Pass through Lethbridge, which get 30-35 Chinook days per year, on average. Chinooks become less frequent further south in the United States, and are not as common north of Red Deer, but they can and do occur annually as far north as High Level in northwestern Alberta and Fort St. John in northeastern British Columbia, and as far south as Las Vegas, Nevada, and occasionally to Carlsbad, in eastern New Mexico. In southwestern Alberta, Chinook winds can gust in excess of hurricane force . On 19-November 1962, an especially powerful Chinook in Lethbridge gusted to . In Pincher Creek, the temperature rose by , from , in one hour on January 6, 1966.ECCC - Historical Data Trains have been known to be derailed by Chinook winds. During the winter, driving can be treacherous, as the wind blows snow across roadways, sometimes causing roads to vanish and snowdrifts to pile up higher than a metre. Empty semitrailer trucks driving along Highway 3 and other routes in southern Alberta have been blown over by the high gusts of wind caused by Chinooks. Calgary, Alberta also gets many Chinooks – the Bow Valley in the Canadian Rockies west of the city acts as a natural wind tunnel, funneling the chinook winds. On 27 February 1992, Claresholm, Alberta, a small city just south of Calgary, recorded a temperature of ; again, the next day was recorded. These are some of Canada's highest February temperatures. ==Versus the Arctic air mass== The Chinook can seem to do battle with the Arctic air mass at times. It is not unheard of for people in Lethbridge to complain of temperatures while those in desert region, just down the road, enjoy temperatures. This clash of temperatures can remain stationary, or move back and forth, in the latter case causing such fluctuations as a warm morning, a bitterly cold afternoon, and a warm evening. A curtain of fog often accompanies the clash between warm to the west and cold to the east. ==Chinook arch== One of its most striking features is the Chinook arch, a föhn cloud in the form of a band of stationary stratus clouds caused by air rippling over the mountains due to orographic lifting. To those unfamiliar with it, the Chinook arch may look like a threatening storm cloud at times. However, they rarely produce rain or snow. They can also create stunning sunrises and sunsets. A similar phenomenon, the Nor'west arch, also a föhn cloud, is seen in southern New Zealand. The stunning colours seen in the Chinook arch are quite common. Typically, the colours will change throughout the day, starting with yellow, orange, red and pink shades in the morning as the sun comes up, grey shades at midday changing to pink / red colours, and then orange / yellow hues just before the sun sets.

As a consequence of the different adiabatic rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the windward slopes. As moist winds from the Pacific (also called \\"Chinooks\\") are forced to rise over the mountains, the moisture in the air is condensed and falls out as precipitation, while the air cools at the moist adiabatic rate of 5 °C / 1000 m (3.5 °F / 1000 ft). The dried air then descends on the leeward side of the mountains, warming at the dry adiabatic rate of 10 °C / 1000 m (5.5 °F / 1000 ft). The turbulence of the high winds also can prevent the usual nocturnal temperature inversion from forming on the lee side of the slope, allowing night-time temperatures to remain elevated. Quite often, when the Pacific Northwest coast is being drenched by rain, the windward side of the Rockies is being hammered by snow (as the air loses its moisture), and the leeward side of the Rockies in Alberta is basking in a föhn Chinook. The three different weather conditions are all caused by the same flow of air, hence the confusion over the use of the name \\"Chinook wind\\". Two common cloud patterns seen during this time are a chinook arch overhead, and a bank of clouds (also referred to as a cloud wall) obscuring the mountains to the west. It appears to be an approaching storm, but does not advance any further east. ==The Manyberries Chinook== Often, a Chinook is preceded by a \\"Manyberries Chinook\\" during the end of a cold spell. This southeast wind was named for the small village Manyberries, now a hamlet, in southeastern Alberta, from where the wind seems to originate. It can be fairly strong and cause bitter windchill and blowing snow. The wind will eventually swing around to the southwest and the temperature rises sharply as the real Chinook arrives. ==In the Pacific Northwest== The term Chinook wind is also used in British Columbia, and is the original usage, being rooted in the lore of coastal tribes and brought to Alberta by the fur-traders.The Facts on File Encyclopedia or Word and Phrase Origins, Checkmark Books, New York, 2000 Such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest. The winds are also known as the pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii. The air associated with a west coast Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon (most of the region's stormy winds come when a fast \\"westerly\\" jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash). When a Chinook comes in when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the tropical dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls and the cold spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm Chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week. The effects on the Interior of British Columbia when a Chinook is in effect are the reverse. In a rainy spell, most of the heavy moisture will be soaked out by the ramparts of mountains before the air mass reaches the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson River-Okanagan area. The effects are similar to those of an Alberta Chinook, though not to the same extreme, in part because the Okanagan is relatively warmer than the Prairies, and because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between Kelowna and Calgary. When the Chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will give way to a slushy melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain. The resulting outflow wind is more or less the opposite of British Columbia / Pacific Northwest Chinook. These are called a squamish in certain areas, rooted in the direction of such winds coming down out of Howe Sound, home to the Squamish people, and in Alaska are called a williwaw. They consist of cold airstreams from the continental air mass pouring out of the interior plateau via certain river valleys and canyons penetrating the Coast Mountains towards the coast. ===Pronunciation in the Pacific Northwest=== The word \\"Chinook\\" is in common usage among local fishermen and people in communities along the British Columbia Coast and coastal Washington and Oregon. The term is also used in the Puget Sound area of Washington. \\"Chinook\\" is not pronounced as it is east of the Cascades – shinook – but is in the original coastal pronunciation tshinook.Example of tshinook original pronunciation from Comparative vocabularies of the Indian tribes etc. by William Fraser Tolmie, 1884. In British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest, the word Chinook was once often pronounced . Currently, the common pronunciation throughout most of the Pacific Northwest, Alberta, and the rest of Canada, is , as in French. This difference may be because it was the Métis employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, who were familiar with the Chinook people and country, brought the name east of the Cascades and Rockies, along with their own ethnified pronunciation. Early records are clear that tshinook was the original pronunciation, before the word's transmission east of the Rockies. == First nations myth from British Columbia == Native legend of the Lil'wat subgroup of the St'at'imc tells of a girl named Chinook-Wind, who married Chinook Glacier, and moved to his country, which was in the area of today's Birkenhead River.Short Portage to Lillooet, Irene Edwards, self-published, Lillooet, various editionsRandy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy. (1977).Lillooet Stories. Victoria Sound Heritage 6.1. She pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. They came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and told her they were coming to get her. They came in great number and quarrelled with Glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and she went home with them in the end. While on the one hand this tale tells a tribal family-relations story, and family/tribal history as well, it also seems to be a parable of a typical weather pattern of a southwesterly wind at first bringing snow, then rain, and also of the melting of a glacier, namely the Place Glacier near Gates Lake at Birken. Thus, it also tells of a migration of people to the area – or a war, depending on how the details of the legend might be read, with Chinook-Wind taking the part of Helen in a First Nations parallel to the Trojan War. ==Gardening== The frequent midwinter thaws in Great Plains Chinook country are more of a bane than a blessing to gardeners. Plants can be visibly brought out of dormancy by persistent Chinook winds, or have their hardiness reduced even if they appear to be remaining dormant. In either case, they become vulnerable to later cold waves. Many plants which do well at Winnipeg (where constant cold maintains dormancy all winter) are difficult to grow in the Alberta Chinook belt; examples include basswood, some apple, raspberry and Saskatoon varieties, and Amur maples. Trees in the Chinook-affected areas of Alberta are known to be small, with much less growth than trees in areas not affected by Chinooks. This is once again caused by the \\"off-and-on\\" dormancy throughout winter. == Health == Chinook winds are said to sometimes cause a sharp increase in the number of migraine headaches suffered by the locals. At least one study conducted by the department of clinical neurosciences at the University of Calgary supports that belief.Chinooks and Health. Retrieved 2 February 2008. They are popularly believed to increase irritability and sleeplessness. In mid-winter over major centres such as Calgary, Chinooks can often override cold air in the city, trapping the pollutants in the cold air and causing inversion smog. At such times, it is possible for it to be cold at street level and much warmer at the tops of the skyscrapers and in higher terrain. In 1983, on the 45th floor [about 145 m (460 ft) above the street] of the Petro-Canada Center, carpenters worked shirtless in +12 °C, windy conditions (temperature reported to them by overhead crane operator), but were chagrined to find out the street temperature was still −20 °C as they left work at 3:30 that afternoon. == Records == Loma, Montana, boasts having the most extreme recorded temperature change in a 24-hour period. On 15 January 1972, the temperature rose from −54 °F to 49 °F (−48 °C to 9 °C), a 103 °F (58 °C) change in temperature, a dramatic example of the regional Chinook wind in action. The Black Hills of South Dakota are home to the world's fastest recorded rise in temperature. On 22 January 1943, at about 7:30 am MST, the temperature in Spearfish, South Dakota, was −4 °F (−20 °C). The Chinook kicked in, and two minutes later, the temperature was 45 °F (7 °C). The 49 °F (27 °C) rise set a world record, yet to be exceeded. By 9:00 am, the temperature had risen to 54 °F (12 °C). Suddenly, the Chinook died down and the temperature tumbled back to −4 °F (−20 °C). The 58 °F (32 °C) drop took only 27 minutes.\\"South Dakota Weather History and Trivia January\\".

On rare occasions, Chinook winds generated on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains have reached as far east as Wisconsin. ==Chinooks and föhn winds in the inland United States== The signature Chinook arch over a Denver suburb in 2006 Chinooks are generally called föhn winds by meteorologists and climatologists, and, regardless of name, can occur in most places on the leeward side of a nearby mountain range. They are called \\"Chinook winds\\" throughout most of inland western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountain region. Montana, in particular, has a significant amount of föhn winds across much of the state during the winter months, but particularly coming off the Rocky Mountain Front in the northern and west-central areas of the state. One such wind occurs in the Cook Inlet region in Alaska as air moves over the Chugach Mountains between Prince William Sound and Portage Glacier. Anchorage residents often believe the warm winds which melt snow and leave their streets slushy and muddy are a midwinter gift from Hawaii, following a common mistake that the warm winds come from the same place as the similar winds near the coasts in southern British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. ==See also== * Catabatic wind * Diablo wind * Loo (wind) * Nor'west arch * Santa Ana winds * Sundowner winds ==References== Category:Climate of the Rocky Mountains Category:Winds Category:Natural history of Alberta Category:Western United States Category:Climate of Canada Category:Föhn effect ml:കാറ്റ്#ചിനൂക്ക് ","title":"Chinook wind"},{"id":"529762","text":"Lyndon State College, was a public liberal arts college at Lyndon, Vermont. In 2018, it merged with Johnson State College to create Northern Vermont University; the former campus of Lyndon State College is now the university's Lyndon campus. It was accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. ==History== In 1911, the college was founded as a one-year normal school housed in rented space in nearby Lyndon Institute. The term \\"normal school\\" is based on the French école normale supérieure, a school to educate teachers. Consistent with education tradition of the times, the Lyndon Training Course expanded its curriculum in one-year increments, and the first two-year class graduated in 1923. In 1927, Rita Bole became principal of the school. The first three-year class, consisting of nine students, graduated in 1934. In 1944, the state allowed Lyndon to grant four-year degrees so long as it remained a teacher training institution. The first four-year degrees were granted to 18 students in 1944. It was during these years that the Northeast Kingdom began to depend on Lyndon to address the educational needs of its residents. Bole, who led the school until 1955, encouraged the Vermont State Legislature to establish Lyndon Teachers College, saw the admission of the first male and first out-of-state students during the 1940s, and oversaw the move to the Theodore Newton Vail estate. Vail was the first president of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T;). Vail had been instrumental in the establishment of Lyndon Institute, and Bole recognized his vacant estate as the perfect place to house the growing school. The move to Vail Manor was completed on June 30, 1951, the final day of the school's lease at Lyndon Institute. In 1961, the State Legislature established the Vermont State Colleges system, a consortium of Vermont's five public colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor and Council of Presidents and Lyndon Teachers College became Lyndon State College. This marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth and, in 1964, the campus began to expand. A library, a dormitory, a dining hall, a science wing, a gymnasium, and a theater were built. These additions began meeting the needs of a growing student population that also brought a rapid expansion of the Lyndon curriculum. In the 1970s, new majors were developed in business administration, special education, recreations, meteorology, communications, human services, and physical education. It was also during this decade that the original Vail Manor was deemed unsafe and was replaced with the Theodore N. Vail Center that now houses the Vail Museum and preserves the name that has become an integral part of the Lyndon State tradition.Lyndon State College Undergraduate Catalog, 2007-2008, p.4 In 2005, a new residence hall was constructed near Wheelock Hall. The building was named The Rita L. Bole Complex, after the principal of Lyndon Normal School. In 2009, the Academic and Student Activity Center, a LEED-certified, or \\"green\\" building, was constructed to house Lyndon's Business, Exercise Science and Meteorology majors. It also contains computer labs, classrooms and a student event center. In September 2016, the VSC board of trustees voted to merge Lyndon State College with Johnson State College, located roughly 50 miles away. The new combined institution was named Northern Vermont University, and JSC President Elaine Collins was named as NVU's first president to oversee the consolidation of both campus into the new university. The merger became effective on July 1, 2018 and ended over 100 years of Lyndon's existence as a separate institution, although the combined university remains public and under the Vermont State College system. ==Campus== The Vail Center had classrooms, and teachers' offices, including English, mathematics, and education. It also contained the bookstore, student center, and snack bar. The science wing contained classrooms and laboratories. There was a television wing for the television studies and was home to News 7, LSC's daily live broadcast facility. It also contained the small Alexander Twilight Theater. It was connected to the Library and Academic Center (LAC). LAC contained classrooms, a 24-hour computer lab, and the three-floor Samuel Read Hall Library. The Harvey Academic Center was located at the center of campus and housed offices and classrooms for Recreation Studies and other programs. The center of campus was centered around a small pond until the summer of 2019. It was filled in and made into a park. There was a large pond across from the library. Adjacent to the park was the Stevens Dining Hall. Adjacent to the theater was the Stannard Gymnasium. The smaller gym, known as the Rita Bole Gymnasium (there is also a Rita Bole residence hall) was used for basketball games, floor hockey, and a wide variety of intramural sports. In this complex was a swimming pool, racquetball court, rock climbing wall, and a fitness center.Lyndon State College Hornets: Facilities On the north side of the campus, across from the baseball fields, was the Brown House containing a dispensary. The Gray House was a special residential opportunity, most recently for those performing service to the community. ==Student lifeClubs=== There were over 25 student clubs at Lyndon State College. They included: *The Student Government Association *Lyndon State Anime Club *WWLR 91.5FM \\"The Impulse\\" - A student-run radio station. *The LSC AMS/NWA - Lyndon State College Student Chapter of the American Meteorological Society *The Critic - A student-run weekly newspaper *The Twilight Players - Campus Acting Guild *Alliance for Women in Media *The Society of Professional Journalists *Lyndon Ultimate (Ultimate Frisbee) *The Lyndon State Rugby Club (Associated with New England Rugby Football Union) *Lyndon Emergency Responders *Lyndon Model UN Club (Attends MUN conferences yearly) *M.E.I.S.A (Music and Entertainment Industry Students Association) LSC Chapter *Lyndon State Ice Skating Club ===Residence Halls=== Residence Halls: Whitelaw (left) and Crevecoeur (right) Half of the student population lived on campus in one of the nine residence halls. The Stonehenge residence hall complex was located on the southern end of campus and consisted of six residence halls: Whitelaw/Crevecoeur (first-year students), Arnold/Bayley, and Poland/Rogers. They were clustered around a central courtyard and shaped in a circle, hence the nickname \\"Stonehenge.\\" Wheelock was a residence hall in the center of campus. Rita Bole was the newest of the residence halls, which featured apartment-style living for upperclassmen. The ninth hall, Grey House, was a living-learning community dedicated to performing community service on campus and in the local area. ==Athletics== The Lyndon State Hornets were a member of the NCAA and competed on the Division III level in the North Atlantic Conference.

Rockhampton was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 6 November 1940, launched on 26 June 1941, and commissioned into the RAN on 21 January 1942. ==Operational history== Rockhampton began her career as a convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. Following a series of Japanese submarine attacks along the east coast of Australia, a convoy system was established. Rockhampton and escorted the first Sydney to Brisbane convoy. The corvette remained in this role until January 1944, when she began escorting convoys to and from New Guinea. She underwent refit in Sydney over April and May 1944, before returning to escort duties in New Guinea waters. Rockhampton operated in both Australian and New Guinea waters up until the end of World War II. Following the end of the war, Rockhampton was involved in the rescue of Dutch and Indonesian prisoners-of-war and the occupation of Ambon. On 8 October 1945, the corvette carried the Sultan of Ternate on his return home. Rockhampton returned to Sydney in November 1945, where she was assigned to minesweeping duties off the east coast of Australia. She later participated in survey duties off the coast of South Australia, before returning to Sydney on 29 April 1946. The corvette received two battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1942–45\\" and \\"New Guinea 1944\\". ==Fate== Rockhampton paid off to reserve on 5 August 1946, and was sold to Kino Shito (Australia) Pty Ltd for scrap on 6 January 1961.

The caves are formed in limestone at the southern extremity of the Sydney basin, a broad expanse of New South Wales between this point, the city of Newcastle in the north, the town of Lithgow to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The caves are precipitous in many places and entry is limited. The presence of \\"Foul air\\", dangerous levels of CO2 or O2, is common in the Bungonia caves, especially in summer and in The Grill Cave in particular. One of the more well-known caves, The Drum Cave, is an important bat breeding site. The Large Bent-wing Bat (formerly known as the Common Bent-wing Bat), is listed as Vulnerable under the Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995) in New South Wales. Drum Cave is closed annually from 1 November through to 1 April in order to provide a safe environment for the bats during their breeding season, but is open and available to the public for the remainder of each year. The importance of Drum Cave for the preservation of the Large Bent-wing Bat is underscored by the fact that the next closest suitable breeding cave is located near Wee Jasper. Grill Cave is also normally closed for the month of December as a bat staging cave. Chalk Cave is closed 1 May to 30 September for bat hibernation over winter; entry to these caves during these periods carries a fine. Many fossils can be found along the various walking tracks in the vicinity of the caves. There are also colour-coded bushwalks through the area. == List of caves == There are over one hundred and ninety caves at Bungonia, though some of these are not much more than small holes in the ground. They include: *The Drum Cave *The Blowfly Cave *The Grill Cave *Argyle Cave *Chalk Cave *College Cave *Mass \\"cathedral\\" cave *Canberra Hole *Odyssey (Note: Closed.

He is a clone of Cable. ==Publication history== The character was created by Louise Simonson and Rob Liefeld, and first appears in The New Mutants #86 (February 1990), a cameo appearance in which his head cannot be seen. His first full appearance was in the following issue, The New Mutants #87 (March 1990). A clone of Cable, Stryfe is the main antagonist in the 1990s crossover X-Cutioner's Song, the 2009 X-Force/Cable crossover Messiah War, and the 2014 Cable & X-Force/Uncanny X-Force crossover \\"Vendetta\\". Stryfe appears as the main villain of the 2018–2019 run of X-Force. ==Fictional character biography== A woman introducing herself as Askani appears to Cyclops and Jean Grey from the distant future after their infant son, Nathan Summers, is infected with a techno-organic virus by the immortal mutant Apocalypse and tells them that she can save the child. Nathan then arrives in the future and Mother Askani clones the baby, hoping to salvage something if he dies. The clone's growth is greatly accelerated until he is the same age as Nathan himself. The Askani succeed in halting the spread of the techno-organic virus in Nathan's body, thereby saving his life. However, Apocalypse and his forces attack the Askani's hiding place and steal the cloned infant. Apocalypse takes the child as his own, raising him himself and naming him \\"Stryfe\\", intending to use him as his next host body. Stryfe grows into a murderously decadent brat with no regard for life who is both terminally bored by having his every desire catered and extremely lonely at having no real company aside from Apocalypse and Ch'vayre (Apocalypse's second in command). Years later, as Apocalypse is about to transfer his essence into Stryfe, he discovers that Stryfe is in fact a clone, thus unfit to house his essence. A teenage Nathan and the time-traveling Cyclops and Jean confront Apocalypse, leaving him unable to transfer into any host body, thus causing his essence to discorporate. Ch'vayre raises Stryfe afterwards.The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #4 Stryfe grows up to be an embittered madman, wanting vengeance on both what he thought were his real parents (Cyclops and Jean) and his spiritual parent Apocalypse. He becomes an anarchist and terrorist rebel in the Nor-Am Pact region 3783–3806 in his alternate future. He raises an army and for years became a fierce opponent of both Cable (Nathan Summers) and his Clan Chosen, and the New Canaanites, a despotic regime that replaced Apocalypse's. Stryfe reveals to Cable much later in the present era that during this period in their life, he raped Aliya Dayspring (Cable's wife who Stryfe had grown to desire) at one point by pretending to be Cable and so the father of Tyler Dayspring could be Stryfe and not Cable. Later, he kills Aliya as well as kidnapping and brainwashing their son Tyler.Cable #1, (May 1993) In 3806, the New Canaanites take full control of the planet, but Stryfe manages to travel back in time two-thousand years. He forms a mutant terrorist group, the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF), alongside many powerful mutants including Tamara Kurtz. Stryfe orders his Mutant Liberation Front to capture Rusty Collins and Skids.New Mutants #87 In Japan, he fights Cable and clashes with the New Mutants, who thwart his attempt to poison the water supplies of major cities.New Mutants #93-94 Stryfe abandons his Antarctic Mutant Liberation Front base during an invasion by X-Force (a team composed of Cable and several former New Mutants).X-Force #1 Stryfe then has the Mutant Liberation Front free the captive mutants Hairbag and Slab, and turns them over to Mister Sinister before ordering an MLF attack on a clinic.X-Factor #77-78 He also confronts and defeats Kane,X-Force #9-10 and eventually declares his enmity for Apocalypse.X-Men Vol. 2 #13 Stryfe later battles Cable, who learns that Stryfe is actually his double.Cable #1-2 Stryfe sows chaos in the ranks of the X-Men, posing as Cable and shooting Professor X with an infected bullet, and taking Cyclops and Jean Grey captive.Uncanny X-Men #294 He bests the Dark RidersX-Men Vol. 2 #15 and Apocalypse, making him leader of the Dark Riders.X-Force #17 As a final insurance, Stryfe gives Mister Sinister a canister that he claims holds genetic material from two-thousand years worth of Summers's descendants;X-Men (vol. 2) #14 in truth, it holds the deadly Legacy Virus. Stryfe battles Cable until the latter opens a temporal rift by detonating a self-destruct system, destroying his body.X-Force #18 Stryfe's consciousness, however, enters Cable's mind, in which he stays until he voluntarily leaves.Cable #6-8 While physically dead, Stryfe attempts to return to life through the body of Warpath.X-Force #73 However, his attempt is avoided by the arrival of X-Force and Warpath is sent back to the living by Blackheart.X-Force #74 By unknown means, Stryfe revives and attempts to subjugate Latveria.X-Man #45 Stryfe is opposed by Cable and Nate Grey, and at first beats them easily, even going as far as to siphon off all of Nate's power. Madelyne Pryor appears to join forces with Stryfe, but secretly steals the psionic energy from Stryfe and gives it back to Nate. Nate, Madelyne, and Cable join forces to defeat Stryfe.X-Man #47 Stryfe reappears, controlling the activation sequence for the Prime Sentinels. He uses them to hunt down Lady Deathstrike, who holds the complete codes for all the Sentinels in her cybernetic systems. Deathstrike is forced to turn to the X-Men, and together they defeat Stryfe, who teleports away.X-Men Annual 2000, writer Chris Claremont, artist Scot Eaton Later, Stryfe experiences a personal existential crisis and becomes depressed at the futility of his efforts over the years after the X-Men finally manage to cure the Legacy Virus, which Stryfe considered to be his life's work and the one permanent victory he had against Cable, his parents Scott and Jean, and the rest of the X-Men. He hunts down Bishop who is possessed by the entity La Bete Noir, whose power rivals the Phoenix Force and threatens to consume Bishop's body and unleash its evil upon the universe.Gambit & Bishop: Sons of the Atom #1 However, Stryfe ultimately regrets the path he took and the choices he has made in his life (stemming from his perpetual identity crisis as a clone), frees Bishop from the entity and sacrifices himself to save the Earth from La Bete Noir. Gambit, however, is suspicious that Cable may have telepathically forced Stryfe to sacrifice himself.Gambit & Bishop - Sons of Atom #6 ===Messiah War=== Stryfe somehow survives and reappears in the future when he is discovered by Bishop, who has been traveling through time in an attempt to kill Hope Summers.Cable #13 (April 2009) This was confirmed by the writer Christopher Yost to be the same Stryfe that had previously plagued the X-Men, mentioning in particular his survival of his fight against Nate Grey and Cable.CCC09: X-Men Panel August 9, 2009 However, when Stryfe was reminded by Wolverine that he already \\"died a hero\\" to just become a villain again, Stryfe claims to not know what he is talking about. Bishop enlists his aid in hunting down Cable and Hope in exchange for helping Stryfe overthrow Apocalypse. Stryfe captures Hope when she and Cable emerge from the timestream. Cable, Deadpool, a time-displaced X-Force, and Apocalypse join forces to defeat Stryfe and Bishop. Cable and Hope travel further into the future, X-Force return to the present, and Apocalypse drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body for his essence.X-Force #16 ===Vendetta=== Stryfe is able to prevent Apocalypse from using his body as a new host and travels back in time to the present in the Cable and X-Force and Uncanny X-Force crossover, \\"Vendetta\\". Upon discovering that Bishop has returned to the present, Hope tries to kill him in an act of vengeance. Stryfe appears and kidnaps them both and brings them to an old, abandoned Mutant Liberation Force base. There, he attempts to manipulate Hope into killing Bishop who has come to realize the error of his ways. Stryfe explains to Bishop how he wants him to suffer after he betrayed him during Messiah War and claims that he was imprisoned and tortured by Apocalypse for years until he planned a successful escape and killed him. Stryfe tries to corrupt Hope by making her give in to her feelings of hatred towards Bishop, convincing her to take revenge and murder Bishop although he is shackled and refuses to fight back out of remorse. Cable and both teams of X-Force soon intervene and combat Stryfe. Hope sees that Stryfe is trying to undo the lessons which Cable taught her and refuses to kill Bishop but she does severely injure him. Stryfe is defeated by Cable and both X-Force teams, but before escaping he telepathically forces Hope to mimic his vast and nearly uncontrollable psionic power in the hope that she will destroy her friends. Bishop helps her to disperse the massive energy and they come to an uneasy truce.Uncanny X-Force Vol. 2 #16-17, Cable & X-Force #18-19 ==Powers and abilities== Stryfe is a clone of the mutant Cable and, as a result, possesses Cable's natural vast psionic abilities of telepathy and telekinesis. However, these abilities are far more powerful than the ones Cable has generally displayed in the main continuity, sufficient to block the use of Cyclops and Jean Grey's superhuman powers. This is because Stryfe was never infected with Apocalypse's techno-organic virus like Cable was. Therefore, he does not have to constantly expend his abilities to keep the virus from consuming his body, which apparently was a huge drain on Cable's capabilities. Stryfe can use his psionic abilities in a variety of ways such as moving large objects with his mind, reading minds, mind control, telepathically negating and activating the use of other's powers, telepathic camouflage, telekinetic flight, telekinetic force fields, mind transference and telekinetic blasts. Stryfe also has far more control over his massive psionic abilities than Cable or Nate Grey, apparently from having a whole lifetime of experience of learning how to use his powers which his alternate counterparts never had. Stryfe also possessed other abilities through genetic manipulation similar to those that Cable achieved through cybernetic augmentation, including superhuman strength and durability. Stryfe wears battle armor of unknown composition that is highly impervious to damage. He has been known to wield a blade capable of harming Apocalypse. He has used various advanced weaponry and technology from the 39th century of his alternate future, including his time-vortex field generator. Stryfe has received extensive training in military combat techniques and the martial arts, and is a master marksman with firearms. He is a cunning terrorist strategist. ==Other versionsUltimate Marvel=== In Ultimate X-Men, Ultimate Stryfe is also the leader of the Mutant Liberation Front. He appears to be a mutant supremacist convinced that Professor X was killed by the United States government and that mutants should fight against the government. His mutant power manifests as the ability to cause \\"strife\\" within people's minds, causing them to voice whatever is bothering them. However, when Psylocke scans his mind she senses that he has no real conviction in what he says, suggesting that much of his mutant supremacist attitude is an act, meaning his real motives are unknown. At his side is the ultimate version of Zero, a young mutant teleporter. It is revealed that Stryfe is actually a con man, working with Fenris to promote mutant unrest so they can sell Sentinels to the government.Ultimate X-Men #84 In Ultimate X-Men, when Cable returns from the future with Xavier they both don armor; Xavier's resembling Onslaught and Cable's resembling the mainstream Stryfe.Ultimate X-Men #92 ===Deadpool Pulp=== In the Deadpool Pulp timeline, a General Stryfe is introduced. Stryfe is a younger, corrupt General, who alongside Cable and J. Edgar Hoover hire Wade Wilson (who in this timeline is a former CIA man, turned merc) to get back a stolen nuclear briefcase.Deadpool Pulp #1 Stryfe is later killed by Deadpool.Deadpool Pulp #3 ==In other mediaTelevision=== * Stryfe appeared briefly in X-Men: The Animated Series. In the episode \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" (Part 4), he was one of Apocalypse's captured psychics. Redistributed in X-Men: Volume 4 (Marvel DVD Collection). ===Video games=== * Stryfe was the final boss in the Sega Game Gear game X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy. * Stryfe appears as a boss in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, voiced by Daniel Riordan. He is guarding the prison in Apocaplyse's tower in which Banshee and Iron Man are being held captive. To help defeat Stryfe, the players will need to use a Psychic Demon Spawn Control to create a Psychic Demon to help them fight Stryfe. He has special dialogue with Toad. ===Other appearances=== * An action figure of Stryfe was produced by Toy Biz in 1992 as part of the first X-Force line. He was packaged with a snap-on cape, adamantium mace accessory and a flip-up helmet to reveal his identity. * A second action figure of Stryfe was produced by Hasbro in 2014 as part of their Marvel Legends line. He is packaged with a golden sword and the head of his set's Build-A-Figure (BAF) Jubilee. * Stryfe has been made in two playing pieces in the Heroclix game system.

In principle, mendicant religious orders own little property, either individually or collectively, and in many instances members have taken a vow of poverty, in order that all their time and energy could be expended on practicing their respective faith, preaching and serving society. Mendicancy is a form of asceticism. ==Religious practice== Many religious orders adhere to a mendicant way of life, including the Catholic mendicant orders, Hindu ascetics, some Sufi dervishes of Islam, and the monastic orders of Jainism and Buddhism. While mendicants are the original type of monks in Buddhism and have a long history in Indian Hinduism and the countries which adapted Indian religious traditions, they did not become widespread in Christianity until the High Middle Ages. The Way of a Pilgrim depicts the life of an Eastern Christian mendicant. ==Christianity== A group of mendicant Christian friars ===Early Church=== Mendicancy in Christianity has its roots in the Bible. In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is described as granting his apostles a “gift of tongues”. This is later expanded upon in Luke’s Acts of the Apostles, where it allows them to be understood by anybody regardless of the language of the person being spoken to. Early 1st Century New Testament figures such as John the BaptistJaroslav Rindoš, He of Whom it is Written: John the Baptist and Elijah in Luke (2010), p. 110 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3631605501 and Paul of Tarsus were also known for extensively traveling and preaching the Gospel to unreached peoples in the Middle East and Europe, although often staying for longer periods than modern itinerant evangelists. ===Roman Catholicism=== In the early Latin Rite church, mendicants and itinerant preachers were looked down upon, and their preaching was suppressed. In the Rule of Saint Benedict, Benedict of Nursia referred to such traveling monks as gyrovagues, and accused them both of indulging their wills, and of being particularly subject to the sin of gluttony. In the early 13th century, the Catholic Church would see a revival of mendicant activity, as followers of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Dominic begged for food while they preached to the villages. These men came to found a particularly Catholic form of monastic life referred to as mendicant orders. These orders were in stark contrast to more powerful, and more conservative, monastic orders such as the Benedictines and Cistercians. Itinerant preachers that belonged to mendicant orders traveled from town to town to preach the Gospel, consciously modeling themselves after Jesus and the Twelve Disciples. Professor Giacomo Todeschini at the University of Trieste has described these mendicants in the following way: ===Other Christians=== Unlike the Western Church, Eastern Christians never created a form of monasticism equivalent to mendicant orders. Rather, all Orthodox monks and nuns follow the more traditionally monastic Rule of Saint Basil. Despite the abandoning of monastic practice within Protestantism, mendicant preaching has still come about independently of it. American Methodists were once known for sending out itinerant preachers known as circuit riders. The Mormons are particularly well-known for sending their members on proselytizing missions away from home. ==Buddhism== Mendicant monk reciting scriptures in Lhasa, Tibet, 1993 Buddhism is one of several religious traditions of ancient India that has an established practice of mendicancy. Monks of the Theravada traditions in Southeast Asia continue to practice alms round (Sanskrit and Pali: piṇḍapāta) as laid down by the Buddha. Food is procured from the faithful and divided equally among all members of the Sangha. A major difference between Buddhist and Christian mendicancy is the understanding of manual labor as a means of support. While many Buddhist communities formulated limited forms of labor for monks, there also exists the understanding that a Buddhist monk must remain aloof from secular affairs. Many of these rules of decorum and acceptable livelihood are preserved in the Vinaya literature of several schools. The Sangha's immersion into the work of laymen and laywomen is also believed to be a sign of impending calamity. ===Theravada=== A young layperson providing monks with alms Buddhist literature details the code of behavior and livelihood for monks and nuns, including several details on how mendicancy is to be practiced. Traditionally, mendicants relied on what have been termed the \\"four requisites\\" for survival: food, clothing, lodging, and medicine. As stated in the Theravada Vinaya: > \\"Properly considering the robe, I use it: simply to ward off cold, to ward > off heat, to ward off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, simply for the purpose > of covering the parts of the body that cause shame. \\"Properly considering > almsfood, I use it: not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on > weight, nor for beautification; but simply for the survival and continuance > of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the chaste > life, (thinking) I will destroy old feelings (of hunger) and not create new > feelings (from overeating). Thus I will maintain myself, be blameless, and > live in comfort. \\"Properly considering the lodging, I use it: simply to ward > off cold, to ward off heat, to ward off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, > wind, sun and reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemencies of > weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion. \\"Properly considering medicinal > requisites for curing the sick, I use them: simply to ward off any pains of > illness that have arisen and for the maximum freedom from disease.\\" In addition, a monk's personal property was also limited. The Theravada tradition recognizes eight requisites (Pali: aññha parikkhàra): #Uttarāsaṅga (outer robe) #Antarvāsa (inner robe) #Saṃghāti (double robe) #an alms bowl #a razor for shaving #a needle and thread #a belt #a water strainer Commentarial literature provides additional possessions based on circumstance. ===Japanese Buddhism=== Similar to the development of Buddhism in China, the Japanese did not frequently engage in alms round as was done in the Buddha's time. Monasteries would receive donations of land that were worked by peasant farmers which provided regular communal meals for residing monks. Nevertheless, piṇḍapāta is occasionally practiced in Japan, primarily within Zen Buddhism. Monks who engage in alms round tend to wear a bamboo hat, white leggings and straw sandals as traditionally worn by itinerant monks (行脚僧, angyasō). When going for alms in groups, the monks will form a line and wander through the town shouting the phrase hōu ( 法雨, lit. \\"rain of Dharma\\") to announce their presence. ==Islam== Among Muslims, especially in Northern Nigeria, there are mendicants called almajiri who are mostly children between the age of 5 to 18 years that are studying Qur'an in cities while begging to get sustenance. In addition to almajiri, Northern Nigeria, which is a predominantly Muslim region has many beggars that may not necessarily be almajiri. This includes people with physical disabilities such as cripples, blind and even aged destitutes.Patterns of Street-Begging, Support Services and Vocational Aspirations of People Living with Disabilities in Ilorin, Nigeria Department of Social Studies, Kwara State College of Education, Ilorin Mustapha, Jaiimi University of Abuja, Abuja Nigeriahttps://www.kwcoeilorin.edu.ng/publications/staff_publications/alhassan_yahaya_2x3k/patterns- of-street-begging-support-services-and-vocational-aspirations-people-living- with-disabilities-in-ilorin-nigeria.pdf ==See also== * Almajiri * Alms * Asceticism * Begging * Cynicism (philosophy) * Dervish * Fakir * Hermit * Kanjin * Mendicant orders * Monasticism * Open-air preaching * Rishi * Sadhu * Sannyasa * Śramaṇa * Yogi == Further reading== * Women of the Streets, Early Franciscan Women and Their Mendicant Vocation, by Darleen Pryds, Franciscan Institute Publications, 2010. , . ==External links== * *Dictionary definition from the Free Dictionary ==References== Category:Asceticism Category:Itinerant living * ","title":"Mendicant"},{"id":"529833","text":"Golden aster or goldenaster is a common name for several plants with yellow flowers in the aster family and may refer to: *Chrysopsis, species are generally called \\"golden asters\\" *Heterotheca, includes some species previously classified in Chrysopsis and called \\"golden asters\\" ==See also== False golden aster, a common name for some species of Heterotheca Category:Astereae ","title":"Golden aster"},{"id":"529834","text":"Episodic may refer to: * The nature of television series that are divided into short programs known as episodes * Episodic memory, types of memory that result from specific incidents in a lifetime * In Geology, episodic refers to events that occur or have occurred periodically * Episodic writing, a publishing format by which a single large work is presented in contiguous (typically chronological) installments * Episodic video game, a video game of a shorter length that is commercially released as an installment == See also == * ","title":"Episodic"},{"id":"529836","text":" HMPNGS Salamaua is a heavy landing craft operated by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF).

It is the first game in the House of the Dead series. Players assume the role of agents Thomas Rogan and \\"G\\" in their efforts to combat the products of the dangerous, inhumane experiments of Dr. Curien, a mad scientist. The House of the Dead has been, along with Resident Evil, credited with popularising zombie video games, as well as re- popularising zombies in wider popular culture from the late 1990s onwards, leading to renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s. The House of the Dead has also been credited with introducing fast running zombies, which became popular in zombie films and video games during the 2000s. ==Gameplay== The House of the Dead is a rail shooter light gun game. Players use a light gun (or mouse, in the PC version) to aim and shoot at approaching zombies. The characters' pistols use magazines which hold 6 rounds; players reload by shooting away from the screen. When a player sustains damage or shoots an innocent, one point of health is removed. The continue screen appears when all health is lost. If the player runs out of continues, the game is over. First- aid packs are available throughout the game which restore one point of health; some can be obtained from rescued hostages, while others are hidden inside certain breakable objects. Special items can be found within other breakables, granting a bonus to the player who shoots them. Throughout the course of the game, players are faced with numerous situations in which their action (or inaction) will have an effect on the direction of gameplay. This is exemplified in the opening stage of the game when a hostage is about to be thrown from the bridge to his death. If the player saves the hostage, they will enter the house directly through the front door; however, if the player fails to rescue the hostage, the character is redirected to an underground route through the sewers. If the player rescues all hostages, a secret room full of lives and bonuses is revealed toward the end of the game. Players can score additional points by shooting enemies in the head and by rescuing hostages. ==Plot== The renowned biochemist and geneticist Roy Curien becomes obsessed with discovering the nature of life and death. While supported by the DBR Corporation and its own team of scientists, Curien's behavior becomes more erratic and his experiments take a gruesome turn. The Curien Mansion in Europe, which serves as his home and laboratory, experiences an outbreak. On December 18, 1998, AMS Agent Thomas Rogan receives a distress call from his fiancée Sophie Richards from the Curien Mansion. Rogan and his partner \\"G\\" fly to Europe and arrive at the estate, finding it overrun with undead creatures, which Curien unleashed. A mortally wounded man gives them a journal containing information about Curien's creations and their weaknesses. Rogan and \\"G\\" reach Sophie, only to witness her being carried away by a gargoyle-like creature called the Hangedman. They later find Sophie, before she is attacked by the Chariot, a heavily armored mutant armed with a bardiche. After killing the mutant, Rogan and \\"G\\" attend to Sophie, who tells them they must stop Curien or else \\"something terrible will happen,\\" before passing out. A furious Rogan goes after the Hangedman to the rooftops surrounding the courtyard. After a lengthy battle, Rogan and \\"G\\" shoot it down. The two later encounter an armored, spider-like creature called The Hermit, whom they also kill to proceed. Arriving at the mansion's laboratory, Curien unleashes his masterpiece, The Magician, a humanoid creature with pyrokinetic abilities. However, the Magician refuses to serve any master and mortally wounds his creator. Curien expresses his confusion regarding his creation's loyalty before succumbing to his injuries. Rogan and \\"G\\" battle the Magician until it explodes, then leave the mansion. ===Endings=== There are three different endings, with which one player sees determined by their score rank. In what the developers called the \\"normal ending\\", Sophie is reanimated and becomes a zombie. What the developers have referred to as the \\"true ending\\" is only seen if the players get the highest rank: Sophie is alive, having survived her injuries. In the third ending, a far view of the mansion is shown and Sophie is absent (leaving it unknown if she survived or not). ==Development== Development started in December 1995 and took one year and three months. None of the development team could speak English, so they arrived at the name The House of the Dead by taking various horror-themed phrases in Japanese and picking the one where the English translated text had the most \\"cool\\" visual, without concern for what sort of connotations the phrase might have to English speakers. The team saw people in their 20s and 30s as their target audience, and hoped that the game would primarily be experienced as a two-player game. House of the Dead was built on the Virtua Cop game engine. The developers wanted to have a more complex system of path branches, and to have the system impact the game's story, but eventually realized these ideas were too ambitious to fulfill within the time allotted to make the game. The enemy designs were drafted quickly, going from idea directly to design drawing without any rough sketches. Anticipating that foreign markets, particularly Germany, would require the violence be toned down, they built in an option for operators to change the color of the game's blood, with green, purple, and blue available in addition to the traditional red. They also cut a female zombie from the game because they felt she looked too much like a normal elderly woman, which could provoke controversy given that the player is encouraged to shoot the zombies. The Chariot was animated by using motion capture with an actor wielding a broom, but the other enemies were all animated manually, using motion capture for reference only. Sega AM4 designed the game's cabinet using screenshots and illustrations given to them by AM1. ===Ports=== In late 1997 Sega confirmed that work had begun on a port to Sega Saturn, as an early version had been delivered to them. The port was handled by Tantalus Interactive and released in 1998, with a port to Windows (PC-CD) by Sega arriving the same year.https://archive.org/stream/Official_Sega_Saturn_Magazine_031/Official_Sega_Saturn_Magazine_031_-_may_1998_UK#page/n63/mode/2up Extra game modes were added to both ports, which include selectable characters and a boss rush mode. Both the Sega Saturn and PC editions have slightly remixed soundtracks. On Chapter 2, there is a reference to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the words \\"Challenger, go at throttle up\\", spoken by Richard O. Covey from the mission control room only seconds before the explosion, can be heard three times before the music loops. These words do not appear in the arcade version; a snickering laugh is heard instead. The title, and boss themes are reversed on the PC port as well. ==Release== The House of the Dead came in two cabinet formats, both upright: one with a 50-inch monitor and one with a 29-inch monitor. ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed The House of the Dead on their May 1, 1997 issue as being the second most- successful dedicated arcade game of the year. The House of the Dead garnered generally positive reviews. Next Generation reviewed the arcade version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Overall, this is an excellent take on the light-gun genre - a sheer bloody scream.\\" The review praised the branching levels, story, creature design, graphics, and destructible environments. In a retrospective review, AllGame awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, likewise praising the story, graphics, and destructible environments, but particularly focused on the game's intelligent challenge. The reviewer dubbed it \\"one of the best shooting games to hit arcades in the late 1990s.\\" The Saturn version held a 71% rating on review aggregation website GameRankings based on five reviews. When Indianapolis attempted to ban violent video games it argued that The House of the Dead was obscene and so unprotected by the First Amendment. This required U.S. Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner to review the game at length, ultimately finding Indianapolis’ ban was unconstitutional. Unimpressed by the graphics, Judge Posner wrote “The most violent game in the record, \\"The House of the Dead,\\" depicts zombies being killed flamboyantly, with much severing of limbs and effusion of blood; but so stylized and patently fictitious is the cartoon-like depiction that no one would suppose it \\"obscene\\" in the sense in which a photograph of a person being decapitated might be described as \\"obscene.\\" It will not turn anyone's stomach.”American Amusement Machine Ass'n v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001). ===Cultural impact=== According to Kim Newman in the book Nightmare Movies (2011), the \\"zombie revival began in the Far East\\" during the late 1990s with the Japanese zombie games Resident Evil and The House of the Dead. The success of these two 1996 zombie games inspired a wave of Asian zombie films, such as Bio Zombie (1998) and Versus (2000). The zombie revival later went global following the worldwide success of Resident Evil and The House of the Dead, which inspired a wave of Western zombie films during the 2000s, such as 28 Days Later (2002) and Shaun of the Dead (2004). In 2013, George Romero said it was the video games Resident Evil and House of the Dead \\"more than anything else\\" that popularised his zombie concept in early 21st-century popular culture. The House of the Dead has also been credited with introducing a new type of zombie distinct from Romero's classic slow zombie: the fast running zombie. After first appearing in The House of the Dead, they became popular in zombie films and video games during the 2000s, including the Resident Evil games and films, The House of the Dead film adaptation, and the films 28 Days Later (2002) and Dawn of the Dead (2004). ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * * The House of the Dead at SegaSaturn.co.uk Category:1996 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Light gun games Category:Mobile games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games Category:Rail shooters Category:Sega arcade games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Sega video games Category:The House of the Dead Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in 1998 Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Windows games Category:WOW Entertainment games ","title":"The House of the Dead (video game)"},{"id":"529842","text":"HIARCS is a proprietary UCI chess engine developed by Mark Uniacke. Its name is an acronym standing for higher intelligence auto-response chess system. Because Hiarcs is written portable in C, it is available on multiple platforms such as Pocket PC, Palm OS, PDAs, iOS, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. HIARCS opening book authors over time were Eric Hallsworth, Sebastian Böhme and Harvey Williamson, who is also operating HIARCS regularly at various computer chess tournaments. HIARCS author Mark Uniacke said in a 2011 video interview that one of his current priorities in development is improving HIARCS to play in a more \\"human-like fashion\\" at different Elo strengths.Kingscrusher YouTube Interview. London, December 11, 2011. \\"Hiarcs chess engine author.\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQX_PxKAMTE ==History== The first version of HIARCS was written in 1980 in PDP-11 Basic, when Mark Uniacke was only 15 years old. Subsequent versions were also written in interpreted Basic, which meant that the program was rather slow. To compensate for this, Mark developed some heuristics to guide the program's search and evaluation in a more 'targeted' way. This resulted in a program that relied on positional algorithms, rather than search depth.Christian Kongsted, How to Use Computers to Improve Your Chess (London: Gambit Publications, 2003), p. 111. At the end of the 80s, HIARCS was rewritten in C, and soon competed in computer chess tournaments. In 1991, Hiarcs went commercial and Hiarcs 1.0 was released for PCs and the MS-DOS operating system. In 1996, Hiarcs 4.0 became the first version to be marketed by Chessbase sold inside the Fritz GUI. Version 11, the first version to support multiprocessing, was released in December 2006. HIARCS 12.1 and 13 are the engines in Pocket Fritz by Chessbase. Since Version 14, released in August 2012, HIARCS has been sold along with its own GUI (Chess Explorer) available on Mac OS X and Windows. ==Competition results== HIARCS has won numerous computer and human tournaments. In 1991, it won the title of the World Amateur Microcomputer Chess Champion at the 11th World Microcomputer Chess Championship (WMCCC), in 1992, it won the gold medal at the 4th Computer Olympiad, and in 1993, it won the World Microcomputer Chess Championship held in Munich. In April 1997, HIARCS 6.0 became the first PC chess program to win a match played at tournament time controls over a FIDE International Master. In the same year, HIARCS went on to win the Godesberg Open ahead of Grandmasters and International Masters. In January 2003, HIARCS played a four-game match against Grandmaster Evgeny Bareev, world number 8 at the time. All the four games were drawn, resulting in a tied match. Since 2005, HIARCS has been tested to be the strongest chess program available on a handheld device. It is the top handheld on the SSDF rating list, and was considered the strongest engine in a comprehensive review of 63 handheld chess programs. In December 2007, HIARCS won the 17th International Paderborn Computer Chess Championship, and after the disqualification of Rybka,Rybka placed first but the program was found to have plagiarized Crafty and Fruit (the GPL'ed runner-up in 2005), and was stripped of its title.

ThoughtCo. is an extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television, comic books, comic strips, boardgames, video games, and films with each episode following a dramatic arc. On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series Wiseguy,Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). \\"Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town\\". Chicago Tribune. and was quickly adapted for other uses. Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as trade paperbacks for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending continuity that once characterised US comics. A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC Superman comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop. ==Dramatic structure and purpose== The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to effect change. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a tragic fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries. Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of character is that of \\"hero's journey,\\" as laid out in Joseph Campbell's theory of the monomyth in his work, The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Christopher Vogler's The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers details the same theory specifically for western storytelling. Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the denouement in the last third or quarter of a story. ==In television and radio== Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called \\"Golden Age of Radio\\", being the 1946 NBC Radio Summer-run docudrama serial, The Fifth Horseman, which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full \\"future\\" decades) surrounding a fictitious nuclear holocaust), and are common in many countries where multi- episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's Doctor Who), as well as most anime series. Many arc-based series in past decades, such as V, were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional syndication (one notable example being the science fiction \\"novel for television\\" Babylon 5). However, the rise of DVD retail and DVR of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as \\"soap operas\\" when they have adopted story arcs. Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as \\"monsters of the week\\") are sometimes dismissed as filler by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers. ===Usage in manga and anime=== Manga and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs. Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as Bleach, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, One Piece, Naruto, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Fairy Tail. The anime Dragon Ball Z adapts four different story arcs from the Dragon Ball manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series. ==See also== * Character arc * Dramatic structure * Frame story * Limited series * Miniseries * Saga * Serial * Sjuzhet * Storytelling *Storyteller ==References== ==External links== *Degann, Jonathan. \\"Game Theory 101 - Part I\\".

Allardyce Range on the island of South Georgia is named for him. ==Early life and education== Allardyce was born near Bombay, India, the son of Georgina Dickson Abbott and Colonel James Allardyce. Educated in Aberdeen, Scotland and at Oxford Military College, at the age of 18, he joined the British Civil Service in the Colonial Office. ==Career== Allardyce first posting was Fiji, where, just two years after his arrival, he was named acting Resident Commissioner for the island of Rotuma. The following year as magistrate and seven years later he was appointed to the Native Regulation Board and made the commissioner of the Supreme Court. In 1894, he was made Commissioner for Native Lands and given a seat in the Legislative Council. In 1895, he was appointed Native Commissioner, the chief liaison between the Fijian natives and the British. The following year he was appointed Receiver-General. He subsequently became Colonial Secretary and a member of the Executive Council in 1898.Fiji Blue Book for the Year 1903, p80Fiji Blue Book for the Year 1901, p76 In 1904, Allardyce was appointed as Governor of the Falkland Islands. After 10 years at the Falklands, he was then transferred to the Bahamas to become its governor, a position he held for six years. Allardyce then became governor of Tasmania but retired after only two years—taking the last three months as leave—as a result of his failure to obtain an increase in his salary of £2750. In fact, a statement made to the Parliament of Tasmania on his salary and allowances was followed by a vote by the Legislative Assembly to abolish his office, although the same motion was defeated in the Legislative Council. Nevertheless, when he left office he was widely praised for his performance of the office. Allardyce was subsequently ordered to Newfoundland where he was to succeed Sir Charles Alexander Harris as Governor of Newfoundland, where he was invited to become patron of the Great War Veterans Association. He was the official Crown representative of the unveiling of the National War Memorial by Field Marshal the Earl Haig on 1 July 1924. He officiated at the opening of the other national war memorial, Memorial University College, on 15 September 1925. Allardyce as governor was a key promoter in the decision awarding jurisdiction over most of the Labrador Peninsula to Newfoundland by the British Privy Council. In 1916, Allardyce was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael St George by King George V. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1927. Allardyce married twice. First, in 1895, to Constance Angel Greene of Melbourne, Australia, daughter of Molesworth Richard Greene. She died in 1918; then, in 1920, he married Elsie Elizabeth Stewart, widow of A.C. Goodfellow. In 1923, Lady Allardyce helped start the Girl Guide movement in Newfoundland, and then in 1924, she established the Newfoundland Outport Nursing and Industrial Association (NONIA). Allardyce was noted as one of the most competent administrators ever appointed by the Colonial Office to serve as the official representative of the British Crown in Newfoundland and Labrador. His brother Kenneth was also a colonial administrator, serving as Secretary for Native Affairs in Fiji.Death of K.J.

The species epithet struthiopteris comes from Ancient Greek words () \\"ostrich\\" and () \\"fern\\". ==Description== The fronds are dimorphic, with the deciduous green sterile fronds being almost vertical, tall and broad, long-tapering to the base but short-tapering to the tip, so that they resemble ostrich plumes, hence the name. The fertile fronds are shorter, long, brown when ripe, with highly modified and constricted leaf tissue curled over the sporangia; they develop in autumn, persist erect over the winter and release the spores in early spring. Along with Dryopteris goldieana, it is one of the largest species of fern in eastern North America. ==Classification== Matteuccia struthiopteris is the only species in the genus Matteuccia. Some sources include two Asian species, M. orientalis and M. intermedia, but molecular data shows that M. struthiopteris is more closely related to Onocleopsis and Onoclea (sensitive fern) than it is to M. orientalis and M. intermedia, and so the latter should be moved to a genus Pentarhizidium which contains those two species. Formerly classified as a member of the Dryopteridaceae, Matteuccia has been reassigned to the new much smaller family Onocleaceae. ==Distribution== It is a crown-forming, colony-forming plant, occurring in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in central and northern Europe,Altervista Flora Italiana, Felce penna di struzzo, Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Tod. northern Asia, and northern North America. It grows from a completely vertical crown, favoring riverbanks and sandbars, but sends out lateral stolons to form new crowns. It can thus form dense colonies resistant to destruction by floodwaters. ==Cultivation and uses== Spore- bearing fertile fronds in early spring Fiddlehead sprouts for sale in Japan The ostrich fern is a popular ornamental plant in gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. While choosing a place of planting it should be taken into account that this fern is very expansive and its leaves often lose their beauty throughout the summer, especially if not protected from wind and hail. The tightly wound immature fronds, called fiddleheads, are also used as a cooked vegetable,http://umaine.edu/publications/4198e/ and are considered a delicacy mainly in rural areas of northeastern North America. It is considered inadvisable to eat uncooked fiddleheads. The sprouts are also picked all over Japan, (\\"kogomi\\" in Japanese) where they are a delicacy. Matteuccia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Sthenopis pretiosus. ==References== ==Sources== *Hyde, H. A., Wade, A. E., & Harrison, S. G. (1978).

The title has a double meaning and can also be understood as Wumen's Barrier; the compiler's name, which literally means \\"No Gate\\", is the same as the title's first two characters. Wumen's preface indicates that the volume was published in 1228. Each koan is accompanied by a commentary and verse by Wumen. A classic edition includes a 49th case composed by Anwan (pen name for Cheng Ch'ing-Chih) in 1246. Wu-liang Tsung-shou also supplemented the volume with a verse of four stanzas composed in 1230 about the three checkpoints of Zen master Huanglong. These three checkpoints of Huanglong should not be confused with Doushuai's Three Checkpoints found in Case 47. Along with the Blue Cliff Record and the oral tradition of Hakuin Ekaku, The Gateless Gate is a central work much used in Rinzai School practice. Five of the koans in the work concern the sayings and doings of Zhaozhou; four concern Ummon. The common theme of the koans of the Wumen Guan and of Wumen's comments is the inquiry and introspection of dualistic conceptualization. Each koan epitomizes one or more of the polarities of consciousness that act like an obstacle or wall to the insight. The student is challenged to transcend the polarity that the koan represents and demonstrate or show that transcendence to the Zen teacher. == Structure and contents == The text was originally prepared by Wumen as a record of his teaching during a monastic training period held at Longxiang (Soaring Dragon) monastery in the summer of 1228. Wumen selected the 48 koans and commented on and added a verse for each koan. His teachings were transcribed and after the training period were compiled into the collection called the Wumen Guan. As was customary in China at the time, an edition might have additions of text inserted by a subsequent owner or publisher. The most well known version of the text is from the Japanese wood block edition made from the 1246 manuscript edition that contains the following sections. * An untitled introduction by Xi Xiang (習巷), publisher of the 1228 edition, written in the self-deprecating style of Zen humor. * An untitled dedication by Wumen to the Emperor and Empress. Works without such dedications were subject to Imperial censorship as being seditious. * An untitled foreword by Wumen followed by a verse on the title. * A table of contents with the title of each koan. However, the koans are unnumbered in both the table of contents and the body of the text and there are no page numbers in the text, so the table of contents is just the list of the koan's titles in order of appearance. * The 48 koans presented in four parts consisting of (1) a title composed of four characters, (2) the body of the koan beginning with the name of the protagonist of the case, (3) a comment beginning with the words \\"Wumen says\\" (無門曰), and a verse beginning with the words \\"The ode says\\" (頌曰). * An untitled afterword by Wumen that ends with the words \\"The end of the volume the Gateless Checkpoint.\\" * An appendix believed to be written by Wumen titled \\"Zen Caveats\\" or \\"Zen Warnings\\"\\" consisting of twelve one-line aphorisms about Zen practice written in the style of Zen contrariness that points to not falling for either side of dualistic thinking. For example, Zen is known as the school of Buddhism that does not stand on written words and one caveat says, \\"Neglecting the written records with unrestrained ideas is falling into a deep pit.\\" * An appendix titled \\"Huanglong's Three Checkpoints\\" (黄龍三關) written by Wuliang Zongshou (無量宗壽) in the late spring of 1230 C.E.. Huanglong Huinan (J. Oryo Enan), 1002-1069. was a Zen master who promulgated three questions as one-line koans: \\"Everyone exists by a particular cause of birth. What is your cause of birth?\\" \\"How is my hand like the hand of Buddha?\\" \\"How is my leg like the leg of a donkey?\\" Wulaing wrote four four-line stanzas (Sanskrit gathas). Each of the first three stanzas comments on one of Huanglong's three questions and the fourth stanza is a summation. Wulaing writes that he penned the four verses to thank and commemorate Wumen's recent stay at Ruiyan (瑞巖)(Lucky Cliff) monastery where Wumen was the visiting head teacher for the training period. * A short untitled addendum by Wuan written on the republishing of the work in the summer of 1245 C.E. Wuan called his brief addition the 49th case. It referred to Bodhidharma's famous Zen motto: \\"Not maintaining written words, but pointing directly to the human heart-mind to see one's own nature to become Buddha\\". * An undated postscript by Menggong (孟拱) consisting of a very brief story of a military ambassador who used his army as farmers to reclaim a wasteland and thus pacify the region. This appears to be a metaphor for the practice of Zen. * An appendix by Anwan dated the beginning of summer 1246, presented in the same format as one of the 48 main koans and consisting of (1) an untitled introduction, (2) a title, \\"Younger Brother's 49th Standard Talk\\", (3) the body of the case, (4) a comment beginning with \\"Anwan says\\", and (5) a verse beginning with \\"The ode says\\", followed by Anwan's signature with the place and date of the writing. ==Zen Caveats== The Wumen Guan has an appendix titled \\"Zen Caveats\\" (禪箴) with one-line aphorisms dealing with Zen practice The word zhēn (箴) means \\"caveat\\", \\"warning\\", or \\"admonition\\", but it also has the meaning of \\"needle\\" or \\"probe\\" (as in acupuncture needles) and is sometimes translated as \\"Zen Needles\\". As with the main koans, each caveat challenges the Zen student's attachment to dualistic concepts, here those especially related to Zen practice. : Following the rules and protecting the regulations is binding oneself without rope. : Moving freely vertically and horizontally without obstruction is the way of outsiders and the nightmare army. : To preserve the heart mind and to purify it by letting impurities settle to the bottom in quiescence is the perverted Zen of silent illumination. : Neglecting the written records with unrestrained ideas is falling into a deep pit. : To be awake and not ignorant is to wear chains and shoulder a cangue. : Thinking good and thinking evil are the halls of heaven and hell. : A view of Buddha and a view of Dharma are the two enclosing mountains of iron. : A person who perceives thoughts as they immediately arise is fiddling with spectral consciousness. : However, being on a high plateau practicing samadhi is the stratagem of living in the house of ghosts. : To advance results in ignoring truth; to retreat results in contradicting the lineage. : Neither to advance nor to retreat is being a breathing corpse. : Just say, how will you walk? : You must work hard to live in the present and, to finish, all the more. I do not advise the unfortunate excess of continual suffering. ==See also== *101 Zen Stories *Book of Equanimity *The Gateless Gate at wikisource ==References== ==External links== *The (incomplete) Gateless Gate at ibiblio *The (complete) Gateless Gate at Awakening 101 *About the Wu-Men Kuan koans edited by Dr. T.

Wall was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Swift Current in 1999, and re-elected in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2016. He became leader of the Official Opposition Saskatchewan Party on July 15, 2004. He replaced Elwin Hermanson, who resigned after leading the party to defeat in the 2003 provincial election. In the 2011 election, Wall's government won the third- largest majority in Saskatchewan's history, with 64.25% of the popular vote and 49 of the 58 seats in the legislature. The 2016 election delivered Wall 51 of the 61 seats in the newly expanded legislature, and 62.36% of the vote. This marked the first time since 1925 that a party other than the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party, or its predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Saskatchewan Section), had won a third consecutive majority mandate. Wall announced his intention to retire as Saskatchewan Party Leader, Premier, and MLA for Swift Current on August 10, 2017. In doing so, he became the first non-CCF/NDP Premier since 1935 to leave office for a reason other than losing a general election. Wall was succeeded as Premier on February 2, 2018 by Scott Moe. Wall resigned as MLA on the same day and a by-election was scheduled for March 1, 2018. The Saskatchewan Party candidate, Everett Hindley won the by-election and succeeds Wall. ==Early life== Wall was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, where he continues to live. He is the son of Alice (née Schmidt) and John Wall, ethnic German Canadians with Mennonite Russian German roots. He attended University of Saskatchewan, and completed his post- secondary education with an honours degree in Public Administration and an advanced certificate in Political Studies. ==Political career== Wall's political roots are in the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan, working as a ministerial assistant to Graham Taylor, Minister of Public Participation, Tourism, Small Business, Co-operatives and Health, and John Gerich, Associate Minister of Economic Development. Wall ran unsuccessfully for the Progressive Conservative nomination for Swift Current in April 1991. Prior to his election, Wall was the director of business development for the City of Swift Current. In 1999, the Saskatchewan Economic Developers Association (SEDA) had presented him with the 1998 Economic Developer of the Year Award. In the early 1990s, Wall also managed a country music museum that was relocated to Swift Current from Kitchener, ON, following a significant grant from the Grant Devine government.\\"Hall of Fame is Lured West,\\" Calgary Herald: September 26, 1991. The facility went bankrupt in 1995.\\"Country Music Center at a Low Note,\\" Regina Leader-Post: December 27, 1995. Wall has also sat on a number of boards including being a founding member of the Southwest Centre for Entrepreneurial Development. Wall also started his own business, The Last Stand Adventure Company. Wall won the Saskatchewan Party nomination for Swift Current in the 1999 election and won handily, defeating NDP incumbent John Wall (no relation) by 69 points as part of a wave of rural victories that saw the NDP cut down to a minority government. He was immediately appointed to the Saskatchewan Party's front bench as Justice Critic, and later became critic for the Crown Investments Corporation as well. When original leader Elwin Hermanson resigned after narrowly losing the 2003 provincial election, Wall announced his candidacy for the leadership. No other candidates stepped forward, and Wall was acclaimed the party's new leader on March 15, 2004. After becoming leader of the Saskatchewan Party, Wall committed to a review of Saskatchewan Party policies. This policy review process reached its culmination at the Saskatchewan Party's annual convention in February 2005 and resulted in a considerably more moderate policy platform designed to appeal to urban voters. Among the old resolutions that were replaced was one that called for \\"boot camps\\" for young offenders. New policy resolutions included calling for treatment for crystal methamphetamine addicts, a patient-first review of the health care system, the development of a comprehensive plan to recruit and retain health care professionals, the development of an integrated addictions strategy for young offenders who are incarcerated, a comprehensive review of the justice system to restore trust and confidence in the system, the establishment of a provincial youth justice board to address youth crime, rehabilitation and restitution measures, support for victims of crime, the establishment of a university research chair in occupational health and safety, and a review of the Workers' Compensation Board. In September 2004, Wall released The Promise of Saskatchewan: A New Vision for Saskatchewan's Economy, a plan to grow the province's economy. In the fall of 2006, Wall released a policy paper on behalf of the Saskatchewan Party caucus, \\"Getting Saskatchewan Back on Track: Addressing Saskatchewan's Labour Shortage.\\" Wall and the Saskatchewan Party consistently led in opinion polling leading up to the 2007 election. In that election, the Saskatchewan Party won 38 of the 58 seats in the legislature, making Wall only the third centre-right premier in the province's history. On November 7, 2011 Wall led the Saskatchewan Party to a historic landslide victory in the provincial election. The Saskatchewan Party garnered 49 seats, an increase of 11. The NDP was cut down to its smallest presence in the legislature since 1982, with only nine seats. This was the third-largest majority government in Saskatchewan's history. The Saskatchewan Party even managed to oust NDP leader Dwain Lingenfelter in his own riding. Arguably the biggest moment of Brad Wall’s time as premier came in the fall of 2010. BHP Billiton attempted to take over Saskatchewan-based Potash Corporation. The story received national and international attention. Wall successfully lobbied the federal government to block the takeover to ensure Saskatchewan had control over this critical resource.https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/saskatchewan-premier-brad-wall- retirement/ During Wall’s time as premier, the province experienced unprecedented population growth and, for most of his tenure, a strong economy buoyed by a robust oil, gas and potash sector. From 2007-2017, Saskatchewan grew by more than 160,000 people or 16 per cent, the most growth in any 10 year period since the 1920s.https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and- media/2017/december/20/population-growth Many credit Wall with attracting new residents to Saskatchewan. Wall is also credited with reducing Saskatchewan's surgical wait times from among the longest in Canada to among the shortest through the use of private surgical clinics within the public system. The policy was initially controversial but soon became popular due to the favourable results.https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/reducing- surgical-wait-times-a-saskatchewan-success-story Other accomplishments include doubling supports for people with disabilities, tripling the income assistance program for low income seniors and removing 114,000 low-income people from the tax rolls completely through some of the largest income tax in the province's history.https://www.ckom.com/2017/08/10/premier-wall-to-make-special- announcement-at-10-a-m/ Wall's charisma also helped him achieve political success. Noted for his quick wit and folksy charm, Wall led opinion polls as the most popular premier in Canada for almost the entirety of his tenure.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/brad-wall-still-most- popular-premier-in-canada-angus-reid-poll-1.4446147 In June 2013, Wall attended the Bilderberg Conference, an annual private conference of approximately 120 to 140 invited influential guests from North America and Europe. In 2016, Wall led the Sask. Party to yet another landslide victory, with the party winning 62 per cent of the popular vote.https://leaderpost.com/news/politics/live-saskatchewan-provincial- election-coverage On August 10, 2017, Wall announced that he was retiring from politics. Wall remains active in politics, most recently in his opposition to a federally imposed carbon tax. After the Justin Trudeau government introduced the carbon tax in 2016, Brad Wall and Saskatchewan was alone in its opposition to the tax, saying it would harm competitiveness while doing little to combat emissions.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/wall-threatens-legal- action-carbon-tax-1.3876489 However, now several premiers and many across Canada stand in strong opposition to the tax with many giving credit to Wall for being the first to take a stand.https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-carbon-tax-just-try-them/ ==Controversies== Wall's leadership style has generally been received as popular throughout Saskatchewan and within the Saskatchewan Party caucus. However, his leadership was called into question at the end of January 2006 when MLA Brenda Bakken-Lackey resigned from the party. Bakken-Lackey cited unspecified frustrations within Saskatchewan Party caucus as being among her reasons for resigning. This led to a by-election in Weyburn-Big Muddy, which was won by the Saskatchewan Party's former caucus researcher, Dustin Duncan. At the party's 2007 annual convention, Wall received the support of 98 per cent of convention delegates for his leadership. In the Saskatchewan Legislature's spring 2006 session, NDP MLAs revealed that Wall had worked in Gerich's office at the time when $15,000 worth of alcoholSaskatoon Star Phoenix, January 17, 1992 was misallocated to the Minister's office. Wall admitted to the media of his partaking in the alcohol and knowing it was \\"wrong\\"Brad Wall on CBC, March 23, 2006 and stated he considered it \\"an asset\\" to have learned from the government's activities. On April 3, 2008, the provincial NDP released a video tape that was found at a former Conservative MP office. The tape was filmed during the 1991 Saskatchewan general election on the day of the leaders debate. The video showed Conservative MP and former Saskatchewan Party staffer Tom Lukiwski making homophobic remarks. Wall was also on the video using an exaggerated Ukrainian accent, making racist derogatory statements about former NDP Premier Roy Romanow. In 2015, Brad Wall was named in a lawsuit against himself, Rob Norris, the former Minister of Advanced Education, and the University of Saskatchewan and its Board of Governors for the controversial firing of the President, Ilene Busch-Vishniac, after the Provost, Brett Fairbairn, fired an executive director at the university and ended his tenure for openly criticizing the university's leadership. Wall and Norris are accused of unlawfully inserting themselves into the Board's decision of firing Busch-Vishniac. The lawsuit is ongoing. In 2017, Wall raised the story of a member of the Saskatchewan NDP who had been sexually assaulted in Question Period in response to a question about the Global Transportation Hub land deal. The story was raised without the consent of the victim, and Wall was criticized for politicising the issue of sexual assault. Interim NDP leader Nicole Sarauer described his remarks as \\"disgusting,\\" and asked he withdraw his comments, and the victim took to twitter to demand an apology as well. After initially stating in the legislature that he would make \\"no apology,\\" Wall later publicly apologized to the victim, saying he \\"was not aware\\" she \\"did not want the matter raised in this forum.\\" It was described by Leader-Post columnist Murray Mandryk as \\"the worst of politics.\\" In 2017, Wall addressed a room of Saskatchewan Party members at a nomination meeting, where he recited a joke about the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel, who was captured and executed by the Canadian government in 1885 following the Battle of Batoche. British Columbia's Métis Federation labeled Wall's joke as \\"foolish\\" and \\"insensitive\\" and called for an apology. After Wall's retirement, he tweeted a derogatory message in opposition to the federal carbon tax, which read \\"Usually when someone tells you to send in money but you’ll get more back in return, it’s a Nigerian prince.\\" Shortly after, Wall deleted the tweet and issued an apology to Saskatchewan's Nigerian community. ==Personal life== Wall resides in Swift Current.

Ventilation facilitates respiration. Respiration refers to the utilization of oxygen and balancing of carbon dioxide by the body as a whole, or by individual cells in cellular respiration. The most important function of breathing is the supplying of oxygen to the body and balancing of the carbon dioxide levels. Under most conditions, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), or concentration of carbon dioxide, controls the respiratory rate. The peripheral chemoreceptors that detect changes in the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide are located in the arterial aortic bodies and the carotid bodies. Central chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to changes in the pH in the blood, (resulting from changes in the levels of carbon dioxide) and they are located on the medulla oblongata near to the medullar respiratory groups of the respiratory center. Information from the peripheral chemoreceptors is conveyed along nerves to the respiratory groups of the respiratory center. There are four respiratory groups, two in the medulla and two in the pons. The two groups in the pons are known as the pontine respiratory group. # Dorsal respiratory group – in the medulla # Ventral respiratory group – in the medulla # Pneumotaxic center – various nuclei of the pons #Apneustic center – nucleus of the pons From the respiratory center, the muscles of respiration, in particular the diaphragm,Tortora, G. J. and Derrickson, B. H., (2009). Principles of Anatomy and Physiology – Maintenance and continuity of the human body. 12th Edition. Danvers: Wiley are activated to cause air to move in and out of the lungs. ==Control of respiratory rhythm Ventilatory pattern === Respiratory centre and its groups of neurons Breathing is normally an unconscious, involuntary, automatic process. The pattern of motor stimuli during breathing can be divided into an inhalation stage and an exhalation stage. Inhalation shows a sudden, ramped increase in motor discharge to the respiratory muscles (and the pharyngeal constrictor muscles). Before the end of inhalation, there is a decline in, and end of motor discharge. Exhalation is usually silent, except at high respiratory rates. The respiratory centre in the medulla and pons of the brainstem controls the rate and depth of respiration, (the respiratory rhythm), through various inputs. These include signals from the peripheral chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors; from the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve carrying input from the pulmonary stretch receptors, and other mechanoreceptors in the lungs. as well as signals from the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. * Medulla ** ventral respiratory group (includes the pre-Bötzinger complex). The ventral respiratory group controls voluntary forced exhalation and acts to increase the force of inhalation. Regulates rhythm of inhalation and exhalation. ** dorsal respiratory group (solitary nucleus). The dorsal respiratory group controls mostly movements of inhalation and their timing. * Pons ** pneumotaxic center. *** Coordinates speed of inhalation and exhalation *** Sends inhibitory impulses to the inspiratory area *** Involved in fine tuning of respiration rate. ** apneustic center *** Coordinates speed of inhalation and exhalation. *** Sends stimulatory impulses to the inspiratory area – activates and prolongs inhalations *** Overridden by pneumotaxic control from the apneustic area to end inhalation === Control of ventilatory pattern === Ventilation is normally unconscious and automatic, but can be overridden by conscious alternative patterns. Thus the emotions can cause yawning, laughing, sighing (etc.), social communication causes speech, song and whistling, while entirely voluntary overrides are used to blow out candles, and breath holding (for instance, to swim underwater). Hyperventilation may be entirely voluntary or in response to emotional agitation or anxiety, when it can cause the distressing hyperventilation syndrome. The voluntary control can also influence other functions such as the heart rate as in yoga practices and meditation. The ventilatory pattern is also temporarily modified by complex reflexes such as sneezing, straining, burping, coughing and vomiting. === Determinants of ventilatory rate === Ventilatory rate (respiratory minute volume) is tightly controlled and determined primarily by blood levels of carbon dioxide as determined by metabolic rate. Blood levels of oxygen become important in hypoxia. These levels are sensed by central chemoreceptors on the surface of the medulla oblongata for increased pH (indirectly from the increase in CSF of carbon dioxide), and the peripheral chemoreceptors in the arterial blood for oxygen and carbon dioxide. Afferent neurons from the peripheral chemoreceptors are via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and the vagus nerve (CN X). Levels of CO2 rise in the blood when the metabolic use of O2, and the production of CO2 is increased during, for example, exercise. The CO2 in the blood is transported largely as bicarbonate (HCO3−) ions, by conversion first to carbonic acid (H2CO3), by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and then by disassociation of this acid to H+ and HCO3−. Build-up of CO2 therefore causes an equivalent build-up of the disassociated hydrogen ions, which, by definition, decreases the pH of the blood. The pH sensors on the brain stem immediately respond to this fall in pH, causing the respiratory center to increase the rate and depth of breathing. The consequence is that the partial pressure of CO (PCO2) does not change from rest going into exercise. During very short-term bouts of intense exercise the release of lactic acid into the blood by the exercising muscles causes a fall in the blood plasma pH, independently of the rise in the PCO2, and this will stimulate pulmonary ventilation sufficiently to keep the blood pH constant at the expense of a lowered PCO2. Mechanical stimulation of the lungs can trigger certain reflexes as discovered in animal studies. In humans, these seem to be more important in neonates and ventilated patients, but of little relevance in health. The tone of respiratory muscle is believed to be modulated by muscle spindles via a reflex arc involving the spinal cord. Drugs can greatly influence the rate of respiration. Opioids and anesthetics tend to depress ventilation, by decreasing the normal response to raised carbon dioxide levels in the arterial blood. Stimulants such as amphetamines can cause hyperventilation. Pregnancy tends to increase ventilation (lowering plasma carbon dioxide tension below normal values). This is due to increased progesterone levels and results in enhanced gas exchange in the placenta. === Feedback control === Receptors play important roles in the regulation of respiration and include the central and peripheral chemoreceptors, and pulmonary stretch receptors, a type of mechanoreceptor. * Central chemoreceptors of the central nervous system, located on the ventrolateral medullary surface, are sensitive to the pH of their environment.Coates EL, Li A, Nattie EE. Widespread sites of brain stem ventilatory chemoreceptors. J Appl Physiol. 75(1):5–14, 1984.Cordovez JM, Clausen C, Moore LC, Solomon, IC. A mathematical model of pH(i) regulation in central CO2 chemoreception. Adv Exp Med Biol. 605:306–311, 2008. * Peripheral chemoreceptors act most importantly to detect variation of the PO2 in the arterial blood, in addition to detecting arterial PCO2 and pH. * Mechanoreceptors are located in the airways and parenchyma, and are responsible for a variety of reflex responses. These include: ** The Hering-Breuer reflex that terminates inhalation to prevent over inflation of the lungs, and the reflex responses of coughing, airway constriction, and hyperventilation. ** The upper airway receptors are responsible for reflex responses such as, sneezing, coughing, closure of glottis, and hiccups. ** The spinal cord reflex responses include the activation of additional respiratory muscles as compensation, gasping response, hypoventilation, and an increase in breathing frequency and volume. ** The nasopulmonary and nasothoracic reflexes regulate the mechanism of breathing through deepening the inhale. Triggered by the flow of the air, the pressure of the air in the nose, and the quality of the air, impulses from the nasal mucosa are transmitted by the trigeminal nerve to the respiratory center in the brainstem, and the generated response is transmitted to the bronchi, the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. == References == == External links== * * Rabbany, Sina Y., \\"Breathing Coordination\\", Hofstra University * Webber, Charles L., Jr., Ph.D, Pulmonary Curriculum Function:\\"Neural Control of Breathing\\", Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University-Chicago Category:Respiratory physiology ","title":"Control of ventilation"},{"id":"529873","text":"Moscow Manege The Moscow Manege () is an oblong building along the west side of Manege Square, which was cleared in the 1930s and lies adjacent to Red Square.

Designed by Spanish engineer Agustín de Betancourt with a roof without internal support for (the building's width), it was erected from 1817 to 1825 by the Russian architect Joseph Bové, who clothed it in its Neoclassical exterior, an order of Roman Doric columns enclosing bays of arch- headed windows in a blind arcade, painted white and cream yellow. The roof, with its internal rafters and beams exposed, rests on external columns of the Manege. Night view. The structure was used first as a traditional manège, an indoor riding academy, to house parades of horsemen and a training school for officers. The 180 m long Manege was large enough to hold an entire infantry regiment--over two thousand soldiers-- as well as an invited audience. Since 1831 it has been an exhibition place. In 1867, Hector Berlioz and Nikolai Rubinstein performed at the Manege before a crowd of 12,000. During the Soviet years, the building was used as an art gallery. It was there that Nikita Khrushchev chided avant-garde artists for promoting degenerate art, an episode known as the Manege Affair. On 14 March 2004, the night of a Russian presidential election in which Vladimir Putin was overwhelmingly re-elected for a second four-year term, the building caught fire and burnt down, killing two firefighters. The wooden beams and rafters collapsed, leaving the walls remaining on site. The official investigation concluded that a short circuit caused the fire, though there was media speculation that a fire at such a historic building, only a stone's throw from the Kremlin, on the night of a presidential election, may not have been coincidental. On 18 February 2005 the restored Manege resumed its operation as an exhibition hall by mounting the same exposition that had been scheduled for the day of the fire. == See also == * Saint Petersburg Manege ==References== *Moscow News, \\"Third Annual Moscow World Fine Art Fair Opens at Restored Manege\\" 6 May 2006 Category:Buildings and structures in Moscow Category:Neoclassical architecture in Russia Category:Equestrian educational establishments Category:Convention centers in Russia Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1825 ","title":"Moscow Manege"},{"id":"529874","text":"Arno Breker's 1939 neoclassical sculpture Die Partei (The Party), which flanked one of the entrances to the Albert Speer-designed Reich Chancellery in Berlin. The sculpture emphasizes what the Nazi Party, as adherents of Aryanism, considered to be desirable Aryan characteristics. Aryanism is an ideology of racial supremacy which views the supposed Aryan race as a distinct and superior racial group entitled to rule the rest of humanity. Promoted initially by racist theorists such as Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Aryanism reached its peak of influence in Nazi Germany, where it was used to justify discrimination against minorities, which eventually culminated in the Holocaust. ==Background== By the late 19th century, a number of later writers, such as the French anthropologist Vacher de Lapouge in his book L'Aryen, argued that this superior branch could be identified biologically by using the cephalic index (a measure of head shape) and other indicators. He argued that the long-headed \\"dolichocephalic-blond\\" Europeans, characteristically found in Northern Europe, were natural leaders, destined to rule over more \\"brachiocephalic\\" (short headed) peoples.. Similar theories were promoted by Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. == Nazi Aryanism == The ideology of Nazism was based upon the conception of the ancient Aryan race being a superior race, holding the highest position in the racial hierarchy and that the Germanic peoples were the most racially pure existing peoples of Aryan stock. The Nazi conception of the Aryan race arose from earlier proponents of a supremacist conception of the race as described by racial theorist figures such as Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther identified the European race as having five subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine, and East Baltic.Bruce David Baum. The Rise and Fall of the Caucasian Race: A Political History of Racial Identity. New York, New York, USA; London, England, UK: New York University Press, 2006. P. 156. Günther applied a Nordicist conception that Nordics were the highest in the racial hierarchy amongst these five European subtype races. In his book Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (1922) (\\"Racial Science of the German People\\"), Günther recognized Germans as being composed of all five European subtypes, but emphasized the strong Nordic heritage amongst Germans.Anne Maxwell. Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870–1940. Eastbourne, England: UK; Portland, Oregon, USA: SUSSEX ACADEMIC PRESS, 2008, 2010. P. 150. Günther believed Slavic people to be of \\"Eastern race\\", one that was separate from Germans and Nordics, and warned about mixing \\"German blood\\" with Slavic one.Racisms Made in Germany, Wulf D. Hund 2011 page 19 He defined each racial subtype according to general physical appearance and their psychological qualities including their \\"racial soul\\" - referring to their emotional traits and religious beliefs, and provided detailed information on their hair, eye, and skin colours, facial structure. He provided photographs of Germans identified as Nordic in places like Baden, Stuttgart, Salzburg, and Schwaben; and provided photographs of Germans he identified as Alpine and Mediterranean types, especially in Vorarlberg, Bavaria, and the Black Forest region of Baden. Adolf Hitler read Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes, which influenced his racial policy and resulted in Günther's Nazi-backed attainment of a position in the anthropology department at the University of Jena in 1932 where Hitler attended Günther's inaugural lecture.John Cornwell. Hitler's Scientists: Science, War, and the Devil's Pact. Penguin, Sep 28, 2004. , p. 68 Adolf Hitler Günther distinguished Aryans from Jews, and identified Jews as descending from non-European races, particularly from what he classified as the Near Asian race (Vorderasiatische) more commonly known as the Armenoid race, and said that such origins rendered Jews fundamentally different from and incompatible with Germans and most Europeans.Alan E Steinweis. Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany. Harvard University Press, 2008. P. 28. This association of Jews with the Armenoid type had been utilized by Zionist Jews who claimed that Jews were a group within that type.Mitchell B. Hart. Jews & Race: Writings on Identity & Difference, 1880–1940. Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA: Brandeis University Press, 2011. P. 247. He claimed that the Near Eastern race descended from the Caucasus in the fifth and fourth millennia BC, and that it had expanded into Asia Minor and Mesopotamia and eventually to the west coast of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Aside from ascribing Armenians and Jews as having Near Eastern characteristics, he ascribed them to several other contemporary peoples, including: Greeks, Turks, Syrians, and Iranians.Alan E Steinweis. Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany. Harvard University Press, 2008. P. 29. In his work Racial Characteristics of the Jewish People, he defined the racial soul of the Near Eastern race as emphasizing a \\"commercial spirit\\" (Handelgeist), and described them as \\"artful traders\\" - a term that Günther ascribed as being used by Jewish racial theorist Samuel Weissenberg to describe contemporary Armenians, Greeks, and Jews. Günther added to that description of the Near Eastern type as being composed primarily of commercially spirited and artful traders, by claiming that the type held strong psychological manipulation skills that aided them in trade. He claimed that the Near Eastern race had been \\"bred not so much for the conquest and exploitation of nature as it was for the conquest and exploitation of people\\". Hitler's conception of the Aryan Herrenvolk (\\"master race\\") explicitly excluded the vast majority of Slavs, regarding the Slavs as having dangerous Jewish and Asiatic influences.André Mineau. Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics Against Human Dignity. Rodopi, 2004. Pp. 34-36. Because of this, the Nazis declared Slavs to be Untermenschen (subhumans).Steve Thorne. The Language of War. London, England, UK: Routledge, 2006. P. 38. Exceptions were made for a small percentage of Slavs who were seen by the Nazis to be descended from German settlers and therefore fit to be Germanised to be considered part of the Aryan folk or nation.Wendy Lower. Nazi Empire-building And The Holocaust In Ukraine. The University of North Carolina Press, 2005. P. 27. Hitler described Slavs as \\"a mass of born slaves who feel the need of a master\\".Marvin Perry. Western Civilization: A Brief History. Cengage Learning, 2012. P. 468. Hitler declared that because Slavs were subhumans that the Geneva Conventions were not applicable to them, and German soldiers in World War II were thus permitted to ignore the Geneva Conventions in regards to Slavs.Anne Nelson. Red Orchestra: The Story of the Berlin Underground and the Circle of Friends Who Resisted Hitler. Random House Digital, Inc., 2009. P. 212. Hitler called Slavs \\"a rabbit family\\" meaning they were intrinsically idle and disorganized.David Downing. Sealing Their Fate: The Twenty Two Days That Decided World War II. P. 48. Nazi Germany's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had media speak of Slavs as primitive animals who were from the Siberian tundra who were like a \\"dark wave of filth\\".David Downing. Sealing Their Fate: The Twenty Two Days That Decided World War II. Read How You Want, 2010 P. 48. The Nazi notion of Slavs being inferior non-Aryans was part of the agenda for creating Lebensraum (\\"living space\\") for Germans and other Germanic people in eastern Europe that was initiated during World War II under Generalplan Ost: millions of Germans and other Germanic settlers would be moved into conquered territories of Eastern Europe, while the original Slavic inhabitants were to be annihilated, removed, or enslaved.Joseph W. Bendersky. A concise history of Nazi Germany, Plymouth, England, UK: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc., 2007. p. 161-2. Nazi Germany's ally the Independent State of Croatia rejected the common conception that Croats were primarily a Slavic people and claimed that Croats were primarily the descendants of the Germanic Goths.Rich, Norman (1974). Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order, p. 276-7. W. W. Norton & Company Inc., New York. However the Nazi regime continued to classify Croats as a \\"subhuman\\" in spite of the alliance.Norman Davies. Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory. Pan Macmillan, 2008. Pp. 167, 209. Nazi Germany's policy changed towards Slavs in response to military manpower shortages, in which it accepted Slavs to serve in its armed forces within occupied territories, in spite of them being considered subhuman, as a pragmatic means to resolve such manpower shortages. Shortly after the Nazis came to power in 1933 they passed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service law which required all civil servants to provide proof of their Aryan ancestry and defined \\"non-Aryan\\" as a person with one Jewish grandparent.Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.10 In 1933, the German Interior Ministry official Albert Gorter drafted an official definition of the \\"Aryan race\\" for the new law which included all non-Jewish Europeans, this definition was unacceptable by the Nazis.Eric Ehrenreich. The Nazi Ancestral Proof: Genealogy, Racial Science, and the Final Solution. Bloomington, Indiana, USA: Indiana University Press, pp.9-10 However, Achim Gerke revised Gorter's draft of the Civil Service Law classifying Aryans as people \\"tribally\\" related to \\"German blood\\". The Nuremberg race laws of 1935 classified as \\"racially acceptable\\" people with \\"German or related blood\\".Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.70 Hitler often doubted whether Czechs were Aryan or not, he said in his table talk \\"It is enough for a Czech to grow a moustache for anyone to see, from the way the thing droops, that his origin is Mongolian.\\" The question of whether Italians were Aryan enough was questioned by the Nazi racial theorists. Hitler viewed northern Italians as strongly Aryan, but not southern Italians. The Nazis viewed the downfall of the Roman Empire as being the result of the pollution of blood from racial intermixing, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Hitler even mentioned his view of the presence of Negroid blood in the Mediterranean peoples during his first meeting with Mussolini in 1934. The definition of \\"Aryan\\" remained in constant flux to such an extent that the Nazis questioned whether European ethnic groups such as Finns or Hungarians were to be classified as \\"Aryans\\". Hungarians were classified as \\"tribally alien\\" but not necessarily \\"blood alien\\", in 1934 the Nazis published a pamphlet which declared Magyars (which it did not define) as Aryans. The following year, an article published by the Nazis admitted that there were disputes over the racial status of Hungarians. As late as 1943, there were disputes over whether Hungarians were to be classified as Aryan.Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.11 In 1942, Hitler declared that the Finns were \\"racially related Germanic neighboring peoples\\", although there is no evidence to suggest that this was based on anything racial. The idea of the Northern origins of the Aryans was particularly influential in Germany. It was widely believed that the \\"Vedic Aryans\\" were ethnically identical to the Goths, Vandals and other ancient Germanic peoples of the Völkerwanderung. This idea was often intertwined with antisemitic ideas. The distinctions between the \\"Aryan\\" and \\"Semitic\\" peoples were based on the aforementioned linguistic and ethnic history. A complete, highly speculative theory of Aryan and anti- Semitic history can be found in Alfred Rosenberg's major work, The Myth of the Twentieth Century. Semitic peoples came to be seen as a foreign presence within Aryan societies, and the Semitic peoples were often pointed to as the cause of conversion and destruction of social order and values leading to culture and civilization's downfall by proto-Nazi theorists such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain. These and other ideas evolved into the Nazi use of the term \\"Aryan race\\" to refer to what they saw as being a superior race, which was narrowly defined by the Nazis as being identical with the Nordic race, followed by other sub-races of the Aryan race and excluding Slavs as non- Aryan. They worked to maintain the purity of this race through eugenics programs (including anti-miscegenation legislation, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and the mentally deficient, the execution of the institutionalized mentally ill as part of a euthanasia program). Heinrich Himmler (the Reichsführer of the SS), the person ordered by Adolf Hitler to implement the Final Solution, or the Holocaust,Himmler noted on 26 July 1942 in response to Rosenberg's attempt to influence Jewish policy that \\"The occupied territories will be Jew-free. The Fuhrer has laid the implementation of this very difficult order on my shoulders.\\" Evans, Richard J. The Third Reich at War New York:2008 Penguin Page 271; Himmler had begun the initial pre-Wansee Conference implementation of the final solution by July and August of 1941. Evans, Richard J. The Third Reich at War New York:2008 Penguin Page 240. told his personal masseur Felix Kersten that he always carried with him a copy of the ancient Aryan scripture, the Bhagavad Gita because it relieved him of guilt about what he was doing – he felt that like the warrior Arjuna, he was simply doing his duty without attachment to his actions.Padfield, Peter Himmler New York: Henry Holt, 1990. p. 402. ===Italian Fascism and Aryanism=== In a 1921 speech in Bologna, Mussolini stated that \\"Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan and Mediterranean race\\".Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 11.Neocleous, Mark. Fascism. Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p. 35 In this speech Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race, Aryan in the meaning of people of an Indo-European language and culture.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39. Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations, and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors. While Italian Fascism based its conception of race on spiritual and cultural factors, Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically \\"pure\\" races existed though biology was still considered a relevant factor in race.Glenda Sluga. The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border: Difference, Identity, and Sovereignty in Twentieth-Century. SUNY Press, 2001. P. 52. Italian Fascism strongly rejected the common Nordicist conception of the Aryan race that idealized \\"pure\\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188. The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean inferiority complex that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior. Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism. However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter-skinned peoples had been depigmented from a darker skin, this theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology.Alan W. Ertl. Toward an Understanding of Europe:A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration. Boca Raton, Florida, USA: Universal Publishers, 2008. P. 8. Anthropologist Carleton S. Coon in his work The races of Europe (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that the Nordic race's light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.Melville Jacobs, Bernhard Joseph Stern. General anthropology. Barnes & Noble, 1963. P. 57. In the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the Nazi Party in Germany with Führer Adolf Hitler's emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues. In 1934, in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism's Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis' emphasizing of a common Nordic \\"Germanic race\\" was absurd, saying \\"a Germanic race does not exist. ... We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so.\\"Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 45. The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by prominent Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther in his book Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (1922) (\\"Racial Science of the German People\\"), where Günther recognized Germans as being composed of five Aryan subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine, and East Baltic while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five subtypes. By 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by Giulio Cogni.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 60. Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 61. Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 59-60. On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book Il Razzismo (1936). Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians. Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions. As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies. He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization. Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, however Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later. In 1938 Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognize Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society. Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognized Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and in a meeting with PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism. The Fascist regime began publication of the racialist magazine La Difesa della Razza in 1938.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 78. The Nordicist racial theorist Guido Landra took a major role in the early work of La Difesa, and published the Manifesto of Racial Scientists in the magazine in 1938.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 80. The Manifesto received substantial criticism, including its assertion of Italians being a \\"pure race\\", as it was viewed as absurd. La Difesa published other theories that described long-term Nordic Aryan amongst Italians, such as the theory that in the Eneolithic age Nordic Aryans arrived to Italy.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 81. Many of the writers took up the traditional Nordicist claim that the decline and fall of the Roman Empire was due to the arrival of Semitic immigrants. La Difesa's writers were divided on their claims that described how Italians extricated themselves from Semitic influence. The Nordicist direction of Fascist racial policy was challenged in 1938 by a resurgence of the Mediterraneanist faction in the PNF.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-111. By 1939, the Mediterraneanists' advocacy of a nativist racial theory that rejected ascribing the achievements of the Italian people to Nordic peoples. This nativist racial policy was prominently promoted by Ugo Rellini. Rellini rejected the notion of large-scale invasions of Italy by Nordic Aryans in the Eneolithic age, and claimed that Italians were an indigenous people descended from the Cro-Magnons.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-112. Rellini claimed that Mediterranean and Nordic peoples arrived later and peacefully intermixed in small numbers with the indigenous Italian population. In 1941 the PNF's Mediterraneanists through the influence of Giacomo Acerbo put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race.Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 146. However these efforts were challenged by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist Alberto Luchini as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested in Julius Evola's spiritual Nordicism in late 1941. Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist Manifesto of the Racial Scientists. The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group, and condemned the Manifesto for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the Manifesto \\"constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country\\". Furthermore, the Council denounced the Manifesto for \\"implicitly\\" crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the Lombards for having \\"a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance\\". The Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the ancient Greeks and Romans in comparison with the ancient Germanic tribes made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Aryan Germans. The Council denounced the Manifesto's Nordicist attitude towards Mediterraneans that it claimed was \\"considering them as slaves\\" and was \\"a repudiation of the entire Italian civilization\\". ==Neo-Nazism and Aryanism== sun wheel has been used as a symbol of the Aryan race by some neo-Nazis Since the military defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies in 1945, some neo-Nazis have developed a more inclusive definition of \\"Aryan\\", claiming that the peoples of Western Europe are the closest descendants of the ancient Aryans, with Nordic and Germanic peoples being the most \\"racially pure.\\"Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and The Politics of Identity New York: 2002--N.Y. University Press, See Chapter 15 for a discussion of Aryan identity politics According to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, many neo-Nazis want to establish an autocratic state modeled after Nazi Germany to be called the Western Imperium. It is believed that this proposed state would be able to attain world domination by combining the nuclear arsenals of the four major Aryan world powers, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia under a single military command. This proposed state would be led by a Führer- like figure called the Vindex, and would include all areas inhabited by the \\"Aryan race\\", as conceived by Neo-Nazis. Only those of the Aryan race would be full citizens of the state. The \\"Western Imperium\\" would embark on a vigorous and dynamic program of space exploration, followed by the creation by genetic engineering of a super race called Homo Galactica. The concept of the \\"Western Imperium\\" as outlined in the previous three sentences is based on the original concept of the Imperium as outlined in the 1947 book Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics by Francis Parker Yockey as further updated, extended and refined in the early 1990s in pamphlets published by David Myatt.Goodrick- Clarke, Nicholas Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and The Politics of Identity New York: 2002--N.Y.

The school was founded in 1847 by the Jesuits and serves students of all religious faiths. ==Description== The mission of Jesuit High School as a Catholic, college preparatory school is to develop in its students the competence, conscience, and compassion that will enable them to be men of faith and men for others. A service program is an integral part of the Jesuit High experience. More than 99% of graduates go on to colleges and universities. Jesuit ranks among the top private schools in the nation in number of National Merit semifinalists. Of the 286 seniors in the Class of 2018, 35 of them were named National Merit Semifinalists and eight were named in the National Hispanic Recognition Program. Selective admission to Jesuit is based on previous academic performance, recommendations of teachers, principals, and/or church parish pastors, promise of future development, and the desire of the student to profit from the moral, spiritual, academic, and physical programs offered by the school. In the long history of the school, no student has been refused admission because his family could not afford to pay all or part of the tuition. For students who qualify for admission, but whose families cannot afford the tuition, Jesuit has a generous financial assistance program. In the 2012–13 academic year, Jesuit provided families with more than $650,000 in tuition assistance, based on financial need only. Jesuit does not award academic or athletic scholarships. Tuition is near the lowest among private schools in the New Orleans area, $9,150 in 2017–2018. Fees are assessed for retreats ($6–$100, varies by grade), for computer class ($50), and for graduation ($100). In 1967, Jesuit became the first high school in the country to have a Marine Corps Junior ROTC program. For several years this program was mandatory for all students; the combination of Jesuit priests and Marine Corps JROTC instructors made the school's disciplinary system unique among American high schools. Guest speakers at Assembly have included alumnus Jay Thomas, authors Pat Conroy, Tony Hillerman, Sister Helen Prejean, Orson Scott Card, Dana Gioia, and Chaim Potok, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin, mayor and alumnus Marc Morial, actor Jim Caviezel, theologian George Weigel, environmental activist Luke Fontana, Jesuit Superior General Peter Hans Kolvenbach, ESPN announcer Mike Tirico, theologian and U.S. Ambassador Michael Novak, and President William Howard Taft. More recently, David F. Dixon is one of the very few non-alumni guest speakers invited to address students at Assembly. ==History== The College of the Immaculate Conception was founded in 1847 and opened in 1849. It was both a secondary school and college, and both were located in the Faubourg Ste. Marie of New Orleans (now the New Orleans Central Business District), a block upriver from the French Quarter, at the corner of Baronne and Common Streets. In 1911, the high school and college divisions were split, and the college division relocated to St. Charles Avenue, eventually becoming Loyola University New Orleans. The high school remained on Baronne Street until 1926, when it was moved to its current location at 4133 Banks Street in Mid-City. The Church of the Immaculate ConceptionImmaculate Conception Church, New Orleans, LA. Neworleanschurches.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-28. remains on the original campus and plays an active role in the Jesuit community. Since 1926, several additions have been made to the campus. In 1953 a wing was added along Palmyra Street; the addition included an auditorium, the Chapel of the North American Martyrs, a cafeteria, a library, several classrooms, and a band room. With the additions made to the school, the building, coincidentally, is now in the shape of a \\"J\\" when looking from a bird's eye view. In recent times, Fr. Raymond Fitzgerald, S.J., (class of 1976) served as school president and was succeeded by Fr. Anthony McGinn, S.J. In May 2015 it was announced that Fr. Chris Fronk, S.J., on active duty as a U.S. Navy chaplain, would serve as the school's 30th president, and he assumed office in November 2016.Fronk In January 2020, Fr. Chris Fronk, S.J. stepped down from school president. Fr. John Brown, S.J. is currently the interim president. The principal is Peter Kernion (Class of 1990). ===Mascot=== The mascot is a blue jay posed with his fists raised, designed by cartoonist Walt Kelly of Pogo fame. A contest among students was held to name the mascot, and the name \\"Jayson\\" won. The school's colors are blue and white to honor the Virgin Mary. Student athletes wore a white sweater with a blue letter \\"J\\" on it and were referred to as the \\"Blue Js\\", hence the mascot. As with most Jesuit schools, the school's motto is Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam (\\"For the Greater Glory of God\\").

The 1946 athletic year yielded undefeated state champions in baseball, basketball, track and field, and football all coached by G. Gernon Brown.New Orleans Times-Picayune, July 20, 2003 It has been said that Jesuit had \\"All the Tricks in '46.\\" In the 2004–2005 school year, Jesuit won state championships in baseball, cross country, soccer, tennis, wrestling, rugby, and swimming, and went to the state playoffs in football with an undefeated regular season. In 2012 Jesuit built Ryan stadium, a state of the art facility accommodating football, baseball, and soccer on a field covered entirely with artificial turf. In 2015, Jesuit was the first prep school in the States to get a germ- zapping robot, gift of an alumnus. Cross country: In 2005, Jesuit became the first 5A school in Louisiana history to win three state championships in a row in the sport of cross country. In 2006 they continued with an unprecedented 4th cross country state championship. Swimming: Jesuit swimming holds the LHSAA record for most consecutive state championships in any sport, with 18 straight. As of November 20, 2010, Jesuit Swimming has captured 36 state championships. The streak was broken in 2005 when the team, still feeling the effects of Hurricane Katrina, was only able to field 12 swimmers, yet managed to take second place, only a few points out of first. In 2006, however, the team was able to recapture the state championship. Wrestling: In wrestling within the state of Louisiana, Jesuit's rival Holy Cross was the perennial state champs under Br. Melchior Polowy in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Then in 1969 Jesuit hired Surachai \\"Sam\\" Harnsongkram as its new wrestling coach. In 1972 the Jesuit High School Blue Jays won the first of 18 State Championships under Coach Sam, including 11 in a row from 1988–1998. Prior to that 1972 win, Jesuit's only state championship was in 1951. And since that string-of-11 (ending in 1998) Jesuit has won 4 more state wrestling championships, with the last being in 2009. High School wrestling in Louisiana has become much more visible starting in the 1990s, resulting in other schools developing programs to challenge the \\"leaders\\". From 1999-til-2015, Jesuit has won 4 more state championships, and has been runner-up in the other years. Baseball: From 2007-09 Jesuit made it to the state tournament three times, and twice to the American Legion playoffs winning one championship. In August 2012, Jesuit's baseball team won the American Legion World Series. Jesuit's American Legion teams also won the national championship in 1946 and 1960. Football: In football, Jesuit High School vs. Holy Cross High School is the oldest continuous high school rivalry in Louisiana and one of the oldest continuous high school football rivalries in the United States. The first game was played in 1922 (Jesuit won by 52–0) and the two teams have played every year since (twice in 1963: once in regular season and another time for the state crown which Holy Cross won) Blue Jays vs. Tigers. The Jesuit Blue Jays Football team went to the State Championship for the 2014 season and played against the John Curtis Patriots and for the first time since 1978 against St. Augustine. Jesuit defeated John Curtis 17–14 to win the Division 1 state championship. Running back Charles Jackson was voted the game's most valuable player. Basketball: In February 1965, Jesuit's all-white basketball team played a secret game against St. Augustine, the city's all-male, all-black high school. The Purple Knights won the game, which was the basis for the 1999 motion picture Passing Glory. That same year, Jesuit won the 1965 Louisiana High School Athletic Association state championship in Class AAA (at the time the state's highest classification) while St. Augustine won the championship of the Louisiana Interscholastic and Literary Organization, the sanctioning body for the state's black schools. In the fall of 1967, St. Augustine joined the LHSAA and became a rival for the Blue Jays in the New Orleans Catholic League through the 2010–11 school year, when the Purple Knights were reclassified Class 4A by the LHSAA. Soccer: In the 1998–1999 season, 2006–2007 season, 2008–2009 season, and also the 2009–2010 season, Jesuit fielded one of the best soccer teams in the nation, winning the Louisiana state title and in all four cases ending the season undefeated. This record gave the Jesuit team a #3 (1998–99), a #2 (2006–2007), a #1 (2008–2009), and a #3 (2009–2010) rank in the nation. The 2006–2007 team is considered the best high school soccer team in LHSAA history. In the three seasons from 2009–2011, the soccer team had a 94-game unbeaten streak, which is the fourth longest unbeaten streak in the country. Rugby: In the 2007–2008 season, the rugby team won the State Championship for the sixth consecutive year with an undefeated season, only allowing 12 points while scoring over 300. Because of a conflict with the senior prom, the team was forced to play in the more difficult multi-school division at the Southern Regionals in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The team swept regionals and moved on to become 8th in the country in the multi-school division at the USA Rugby Boys High School National Championship. In 2017, the Blue Jays reclaimed the State Championship, winning the title for the first time since 2011, with an overtime victory over the Bayou Hurricanes, 25–22. In 2018, the Blue Jays remained the State Champions with a victory over the Brother Martin Crusaders, 22–12. Lacrosse: In 2014, Jesuit New Orleans won the 2014 Allstate Sugar Bowl Lacrosse Classic, with 14 schools competing from Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. Golf: Jesuit won the state championship twice in the late 1990s. Rear view of Jesuit from corner of Banks & S. Solomon ==Hurricane Katrina== When the flooding following Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, Jesuit High School was inundated, five feet (1.5 m) of water ruining the ground floor. When the school announced that it was closed indefinitely, many students enrolled in schools in cities to which they had evacuated. The largest concentration of students attended a satellite school at Strake Jesuit College Preparatory in Houston; at one point, approximately 420 displaced students attended classes at night with their own teachers and classmates. In mid-October, Jesuit opened another satellite school at St. Martin's Episcopal School in Metairie in unincorporated Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, which about 500 students attended until Thanksgiving. After Thanksgiving, Jesuit's students and faculty returned to their own campus, becoming the first flooded school in New Orleans to reopen – albeit with an unusable first floor. The school held its annual Thanksgiving Drive for the poor living in the surrounding neighborhoods. On 23 January 2006, 1285 of the 1450 students returned to attend Jesuit for the second semester. After the Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017, Jesuit hosted students from Colegio San Ignacio in Puerto Rico. ==Notable alumni== In chronological order: *Edward Douglass White (Class of 1865), Chief Justice of the United States *Larry Gilbert (Class of 1910), MLB player (Boston Braves) *F.

The carotid body is located in the adventitia, in the bifurcation (fork) of the common carotid artery, which runs along both sides of the neck.(guyton and hall ;text book of medical physiology) The carotid body detects changes in the composition of arterial blood flowing through it, mainly the partial pressure of arterial oxygen, but also of carbon dioxide. It is also sensitive to changes in blood pH, and temperature. ==Structure== The carotid body is made up of two types of cells, called glomus cells: glomus type I cells are peripheral chemoreceptors, and glomus type II cells are sustentacular supportive cells. * Glomus type I cells are derived from the neural crest. They release a variety of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, ATP, and dopamine that trigger EPSPs in synapsed neurons leading to the respiratory center. They are innervated by axons of the glossopharyngeal nerve which collectively are called the carotid sinus nerve. * Glomus type II cells resemble glial cells, express the glial marker S100 and act as supporting cells. ==Function== The carotid body functions as a sensor: it responds to a stimulus, primarily O2 partial pressure, which is detected by the type I (glomus) cells, and triggers an action potential through the afferent fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve, which relays the information to the central nervous system. ===Stimulus=== The carotid body peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). This is in contrast to the central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata that are primarily sensitive to changes in pH and PCO2 (a decrease in pH and an increase in PCO2). The carotid body chemoreceptors are also sensitive to pH and PCO2, but only secondarily. More specifically, the sensitivity of carotid body chemoreceptors to decreased PO2 is greater when pH is decreased and PCO2 is increased. Impulse rate for carotid bodies is particularly sensitive to changes in arterial PO2 in the range of 60down to 30 mm Hg, a range in which hemoglobin saturation with oxygen decreases rapidly.(Guyton and hall, Textbook of Medical Physiology)(13th edition) The output of the carotid bodies is low at an oxygen partial pressure above about 100mmHg (13,3 kPa) (at normal physiological pH), but below 60mmHg the activity of the type I (glomus) cells increases rapidly due to a decrease in hemoglobin-oxygen saturation below 90%. ===Detection=== The mechanism for detecting reductions in PO2 has yet to be identified, there may be multiple mechanisms and could vary between species. Hypoxia detection has been shown to depend upon increased hydrogen sulfide generation produced by cystathionine gamma-lyase as hypoxia detection is reduced in mice in which this enzyme is knocked out or pharmacologically inhibited. The process of detection involves the interaction of cystathionine gamma-lyase with hemeoxygenase-2 and the production of carbon monoxide.Peng Y-J, Nanduri J, Raghuraman G, Souvannakitti D, Gadalla M.M, Kumar GK, Snyder SH, Prabhakar NR. (2010). H2S mediates O2 sensing in the carotid body PNAS 107 (23) 10719-10724. Yet, some studies show that physiologic concentration of hydrogen sulfide may not be strong enough to trigger such responses. Other theories suggest it may involve mitochondrial oxygen sensors and the haem-containing cytochromes that undergo reversible one-electron reduction during oxidative-phosphorylation. Haem reversibly binds O2 with an affinity similar to that of the carotid body, suggesting that haem containing proteins may have a role in O2, potentially this could be one of the complexes involved in oxidative-phosphorylation. This leads to increases in reactive oxygen species and rises in intracellular Ca2+. However, whether hypoxia leads to an increase or decrease in reactive oxygen species is unknown. The role of reactive oxygen species in hypoxia sensing is also under question. The oxygen dependent enzyme haem-oxidase has also been put forward as a hypoxia sensor. In normoxia, haem-oxygenase generates carbon monoxide (CO), CO activates the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, BK. Falls in CO that occur as a consequence of hypoxia would lead to closure of this potassium channel and this would lead to membrane depolarisation and consequence activation of the carotid body. A role for the \\"energy sensor\\" AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has also been proposed in hypoxia sensing. This enzyme is activated during times of net energy usage and metabolic stress, including hypoxia. AMPK has a number of targets and it appears that, in the carotid body, when AMPK is activated by hypoxia, it leads to downstream potassium channel closure of both O2-sentive TASK-like and BK channels An increased PCO2 is detected because the CO2 diffuses into the cell, where it increases the concentration of carbonic acid and thus protons. The precise mechanism of CO2 sensing is unknown, however it has been demonstrated that CO2 and low pH inhibit a TASK-like potassium conductance, reducing potassium current. This leads to depolarisation of the cell membrane which leads to Ca2+ entry, excitation of glomus cells and consequent neurotransmitter release. Arterial acidosis (either metabolic or from altered PCO2) inhibits acid-base transporters (e.g. Na+-H+) which raise intracellular pH, and activates transporters (e.g. Cl−-HCO3−) which decrease it. Changes in proton concentration caused by acidosis (or the opposite from alkalosis) inside the cell stimulates the same pathways involved in PCO2 sensing. Another mechanism is through oxygen sensitive potassium channels. A drop in dissolved oxygen lead to closing of these channels which results in depolarization. This leads to release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the glossopharyngeal and vagus afferente to the vasomotor area. ===Action potential=== The type I (glomus) cells in the carotid (and aortic bodies) are derived from neuroectoderm and are thus electrically excitable. A decrease in oxygen partial pressure, an increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure, and a decrease in arterial pH can all cause depolarization of the cell membrane, and they affect this by blocking potassium currents. This reduction in the membrane potential opens voltage-gated calcium channels, which causes a rise in intracellular calcium concentration. This causes exocytosis of vesicles containing a variety of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, adenosine, ATP, substance P, and met-enkephalin. These act on receptors on the afferent nerve fibres which lie in apposition to the glomus cell to cause an action potential. ===Relay=== The feedback from the carotid body is sent to the cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla oblongata via the afferent branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The efferent fibres of the aortic body chemoreceptors are relayed by the vagus nerve. These centers, in turn, regulate breathing and blood pressure, with hypoxia causing an increase in ventilation. ==Clinical significance== Micrograph of a carotid body tumor. ===Paraganglioma=== A paraganglioma is a tumor that may involve the carotid body and is usually benign. Rarely, a malignant neuroblastoma may originate from the carotid body. ==References== Category:Angiology Category:Respiration ","title":"Carotid body"},{"id":"529896","text":"A juvenile Western Fence Lizard. The western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) is a common lizard of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Northern Mexico, and the surrounding area. As the ventral abdomen of an adult is characteristically blue, it is also known as the blue-belly. It is a member of the genus Sceloporus (the spiny lizards). ==Taxonomy== Taxonomy for the western fence lizard has been under much debate. S. occidentalis belongs in the order Squamata (snakes and lizards) and the suborder Iguania. The family in which it belongs is still under scrutiny. The family Phrynosomatidae, along with seven other families, used to be included in the single family Iguanidae, until Frost and Etheridge's (1989) analysis of iguanian systematics suggested the family be divided.Family Phrynosomatidae from Animal Diversity Web Most literature, however, still place the phrynosomatids in Iguanidae. Six subspecies are recognized, as follows: *Island fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis becki *San Joaquin fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis biseriatus *Coast Range fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis bocourtii *Great Basin fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis longipes *Northwestern fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis occidentalis *Sierra fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis taylori Some authors have raised the island fence lizard to specific rank, Sceloporus becki. However, recent work in molecular systematics has suggested there are four clades and 11 genetically separable populations, and the subspecies will probably have to be redefined. ==Identification== S. o. occidentalis courting on a log Western fence lizards measure 5.7–8.9 cm (snout-vent length)Stebbins, Robert C. \\"A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians.\\" 3rd ed. Peterson Field Guides, 2003 and a total length of about 21 cm.Sceloporus occidentalis from Idaho Museum of Natural History They are brown to black in color (the brown may be sandy or greenish) and have black stripes on their backs, but their most distinguishing characteristic is their bright blue bellies. The ventral sides of the limbs are yellow.Sceloporus occidentalis from San Diego Natural History Museum These lizards also have blue patches on their throats. This bright coloration is faint or absent in both females and juveniles. In some populations the males also display iridescent, bright turquoise blue spots on the dorsal surface. The scales of S. occidentalis are sharply keeled, and between the interparietal and rear of thighs, there are 35–57 scales. Many other lizards have similar bright-blue coloring. The eastern fence lizard, S. undulatus, instead of having one large patch on its throat, has two small patches. The sagebrush lizard, S. graciosus, lacks yellow limbs and has smaller dorsal scales. S. occidentalis also resembles the side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana. However, the axilla of U. stansburiana usually has a black spot behind it and it has a complete gular fold. ==Distribution and habitat== Although California is the heart of the range of this lizard, it is also found in eastern and southwestern Oregon (some populations are found even north of Seattle, Washington), as well as in the Columbia River Gorge, southwestern Idaho, Nevada, western Utah, northwestern Baja California, Arizona, and some of the islands off the coast of both California and Baja California. There is also an isolated population in the Northwestern Tualatin Valley, around Henry Hagg Lake.C. Michael Hogan (2008) \\"Western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis)\\", Globaltwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg The western fence lizard occupies a variety of habitats. It is found in grassland, broken chaparral, sagebrush, woodland, coniferous forest, and farmland, and occupies elevations from sea level to 10,800 ft. They generally avoid the harsh desert and are often found near water. As of now, the western fence lizard is listed as unprotected, and no conservation restrictions apply. ==Behavior== alt= These lizards are diurnal, and are commonly seen sunning on paths, rocks, and fence posts, and other high places, which makes them an easy target for predation by birds and even some mammals, such as shrews. Also they can be prey for Alligator lizards during cold mornings.They protect themselves by employing their fast reflexes, which are common in many other lizards including biting and possibly defecating on the predator. They can change color from light grey or tan to nearly jet black, but they probably use this ability for the purpose of thermoregulation while basking and not as a means to camouflage themselves. The western fence lizard eats spiders and insects such as beetles, mosquitoes, and various types of grasshoppers. Camouflaging Like most other lizards, S. occidentalis goes through a period of brumation during the winter. The length of time and when they emerge varies depending on climate. During the mating season, adult males will defend a home range. ==Reproduction== Western fence lizards mate in the spring, and do not breed until the spring of their second year. Females lay one to three clutches of three to 17 eggs (usually eight) between April and July. The eggs hatch in August. S. o. bocourtii Closeup of head ==Lyme disease== Studies have shown Lyme disease is lower in areas where the lizards occur. When ticks carrying Lyme disease feed on these lizards' blood (which they commonly do, especially around their ears), a protein in the lizard's blood kills the bacterium in the tick that causes Lyme disease. The infection inside the ticks' gut is therefore cleared and the tick no longer carries Lyme disease. ==References== ==See also== * Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep Category:Phrynosomatidae Western fence lizard Category:Reptiles of the United States Category:Reptiles of Mexico Category:Fauna of the Western United States Category:Fauna of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Fauna of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Fauna of the San Francisco Bay Area Western fence lizard ","title":"Western fence lizard"},{"id":"529901","text":"1926 in sports describes the year's events in world sport. ==American football== * Frankford Yellow Jackets win the National Football League championship with a league record of 14–1–1 * Rose Bowl (1925 season): ** The Alabama Crimson Tide won 20-19 over the Washington Huskies to share the college football national championship ==Association football== England * The Football League – Huddersfield Town 57 points, Arsenal 52, Sunderland 48, Bury 47, Sheffield United 46, Aston Villa 44 * FA Cup final – Bolton Wanderers 1–0 Manchester City at Empire Stadium, Wembley, London * Huddersfield Town is the first team to win the League championship title three times in succession.

The heart requires a continuous supply of oxygen to function and survive, much like any other tissue or organ of the body. The coronary arteries wrap around the entire heart. The two main branches are the left coronary artery (LCA) and right coronary artery (RCA). The arteries can additionally be categorized based on the area of the heart they provide circulation for. These categories are called epicardial (above the epicardium, or the outermost tissue of the heart) and microvascular (close to the endocardium, or the innermost tissue of the heart). Reduced function of the coronary arteries can lead to decreased flow of oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Not only does this affect supply to the heart muscle itself, but it also can affect the ability of the heart to pump blood throughout the body. Therefore, any disorder or disease of the coronary arteries can have a serious impact on health, possibly leading to angina, a heart attack, and even death. == Structure == The coronary arteries are mainly composed of the left and right coronary arteries, both of which give off several branches as shown in the 'Coronary artery flow' figure. * 384x384pxAorta **Left coronary artery (LCA) ***Left anterior descending artery ***Left circumflex artery ***Posterior descending artery ***Ramus or intermediate artery **Right coronary artery (RCA) ***Right marginal artery ***Posterior descending artery The left coronary artery (LCA) arises from the aorta within the left cusp of the aortic valve and feeds blood to the left side of the heart. It branches into two arteries, the left anterior descending and the left circumflex. The left anterior descending artery perfuses the interventricular septum and anterior wall of the left ventricle. The left circumflex artery perfuses the left ventricular free wall. In approximately 33% of individuals, the left coronary artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery which perfuses the posterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle. Sometimes a third branch is formed at the fork between left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries known as a ramus or intermediate artery. The right coronary artery (RCA) originates within the right cusp of the aortic valve. It travels down the right coronary sulcus, towards the crux of the heart. The RCA primarily branches into the right marginal arteries, and, in 67% of individuals, gives place to the posterior descending artery. The right marginal arteries perfuse the right ventricle and the posterior descending artery perfuses the left ventricular posterior and inferior walls. There is also the conus artery, which is only present in about 45 percent of the human population, and which provides collateral blood flow to the heart when the left anterior descending artery is occluded. ==Clinical significance== atherosclerosis Narrowing of the arteries can be caused by a process known as atherosclerosis (most common), arteriosclerosis, or arteriolosclerosis. This occurs when plaques (made up of deposits of cholesterol and other substances) build up over time in the walls of the arteries. Coronary artery disease (CAD) or ischemic heart disease (IHD) are the terms used to describe narrowing of the coronary arteries. As the disease progresses, plaque buildup can partially block blood flow to the heart muscle. Without enough blood supply (ischemia), the heart is unable to work properly, especially under increased stress. Stable angina is chest pain on exertion that improves with rest. Unstable angina is chest pain that can occur at rest, feels more severe, and/or last longer than stable angina. It is caused by more severe narrowing of the arteries. heart attack A heart attack results from a sudden plaque rupture and formation of a thrombus (blood clot) that completely blocks blood flow to a portion of the heart leading to tissue death (infarct). CAD can also result in heart failure or arrhythmias. Heart failure is caused by chronic oxygen deprivation due to reduced blood flow, which weakens the heart over time. Arrhythmias are caused by inadequate blood supply to the heart that interferes with the heart's electric impulse. The coronary arteries can constrict as a response to various stimuli, mostly chemical. This is known as a coronary reflex. There is also a rare condition known as spontaneous coronary artery dissection, in which the wall of one of the coronary arteries tears, causing severe pain. Unlike CAD, spontaneous coronary artery dissection is not due to plaque buildup in arteries, and tends to occur in younger individuals, including women who have recently given birth or men who do intense exercise. ==Name etymology== The word corona is a Latin word meaning \\"crown\\", from the Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnè, “garland, wreath”). It was applied to the coronary arteries because of a notional resemblance (compare the photos). The word arterie in Anglo-French (artaire in Old French, and artērium in Latin) means \\"windpipe\\" and \\"an artery.\\" It was applied to the coronary arteries because the arteries do not contain blood after death. == See also == * Coronary circulation * Left coronary artery * Right coronary artery * Heart * Cardiology * Coronary artery disease * Angina * Unstable angina * Heart attack ==Additional images== thumb thumb ==References== Category:Anatomy Category:Cardiac anatomy ","title":"Coronary arteries"},{"id":"529921","text":"1928 in sports describes the year's events in world sport. ==American football== * Providence Steam Roller wins the National Football League title * USC Trojans – college football national championship shared with Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets ==Association football== Czechoslovakia * Dukla Prague was founded, as predecessor for 1.

The first Inspire debuted in 1990 as the Accord Inspire, a sister nameplate to the Honda Vigor, but sold at different retail channels in Japan, known as Honda Verno for the Vigor/Saber, and the Inspire at Honda Clio stores. The Inspire was developed during what was known in Japan as the Japanese asset price bubble or \\"bubble economy\\". In 1995, the Inspire was updated by the second generation model, on a platform it shared with the Honda Legend, and exported to the US as the Acura 3.2 TL, while the Vigor nameplate was replaced with the Honda Saber. The longitudinal 2.5 L straight-5 engine layout and platform remained and was sold as the Acura 2.5 TL. In 1999, these cars were replaced by the third generation TL that was based on the US-spec Accord platform, and largely designed and engineered in the US by Honda R&D; Americas, Inc. in Raymond, Ohio. Manufactured in the US, these were imported into Japan as the new Inspire and Saber. In June 2003, the fourth generation Inspire was introduced in Japan derived from the North American Honda Accord V6. This Inspire marks the first time Honda introduced their Variable Cylinder Management technology. In October 2005, the fourth generation Inspire received a mild restyle, with new headlights, new taillights, revised interior and new colors. The Inspire targeted the Nissan Teana, the Toyota Mark X and numerous other entry level luxury cars from Japan. In October 2007, the fifth generation of the Inspire was previewed at the Tokyo Auto Show. It is essentially a rebadged 2008 North American-market Accord with minor exterior and interior modifications. In September 2012, after 6 generations and the introduction of the ninth generation Accord, the Inspire ended production for a short period after 23 years before relaunching in 2018 as a China-only model based on the tenth generation Accord. __TOC__ ==First generation series CB5, CC2 & CC3 (1989–1995)== 1st-gen Honda Inspire On October 12, 1989, the Honda Accord Inspire was introduced. The platform was shared with the Honda Vigor, a JDM Honda Accord derived five-cylinder luxury sedan available only at Honda Verno dealerships. The Inspire was introduced before the recession developed in Japan in the early 1990s (known in Japan as the \\"bubble economy\\"), and Honda wanted a car that would compete with the Toyota Cresta and Nissan Laurel, with the unique inline 5-cylinder Honda G engine, in a front-wheel- drive configuration. This 5-cylinder engine was also used in the JDM Honda Rafaga, which was a shorter sedan shared with the second generation Honda Ascot. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel. The body style was a four-door hardtop, but it wasn't a true hardtop, using a \\"B\\" pillar between the front and rear passenger compartments, and instead it used frameless doors. The Inspire was available in two versions; a shorter and narrower version badged as the Accord Inspire, with a G20A 2.0L engine in compliance with Japanese vehicle size requirements for cars classified as \\"compact\\". The CB5 Inspire was offered in three trim levels, the base AZ-i with manual transmission, AG-I with fog lamps and optional sunroof as well as central locking, and the top spec luxury AX-I with leather upholstery, more safety features and full cruise control as well as power seats. A longer and wider version with the 5 cylinder G25A 2.5L engine debuted in early 1992, similar in dimensions to the first generation Legend. The larger CC2-CC3 Inspire was a mild refresh of the first CB5 Inspire, featuring updated full-width boot lamps (the updated Vigor had conventional single lamp units) with less chrome, larger bumpers with new wrap-around cornering lamp design (instead of the optional separate units like the CB5) and mesh alloy wheels. Following the 1992 refresh, the Inspire offered fewer trim levels and the inline-five received upgrades (power was up from 118KW to 140KW). The CC2 Inspire shared more features with the Acura Vigor under a 'wide-body' marketing campaign with minor differences. The Inspire offered a luxurious approach to the interior as a lower price alternative to the top level Legend, and both vehicles were sold at Honda Clio dealerships. Interior appearance was provided by the Japanese furniture company, Tendo Mokko, offering unique leather interior and a choice of genuine wood inserts for the dashboard and center console. The SOHC four valves per cylinder G20A inline-five engine was all new, with a choice of 2.0 L or 2.5 L engine displacement. Japanese buyers had a choice of two engine displacements which was a consideration as to how much annual road tax they were willing to pay. The car with the larger engine had a much higher level of standard and luxury equipment to justify the expense. The transmission is attached behind the engine, with a driveshaft that sends power to the front of the car to an asymmetrically installed limited-slip differential which then supplies power to the front wheels using half shafts; this allowed the powertrain to remain slightly behind the front wheels. This also gave the car a 60:40 front to rear weight distribution. The turning radius of the Inspire also was not as tight as its competitors due to the use of Constant-velocity joint installed on the front axle half shafts, but the Inspire did have an advantage in adverse traction conditions. ==Second generation series UA1 through UA3 (1995–1998)== Honda Inspire The second generation Inspire was almost identical in its dimensions to the first generation 1986 Honda Legend, with that vehicle having been updated and enlarged to better fit the role of flagship for the Honda and Acura brands. The second generation Inspire was available with the Type I 3.2 L V6 offered in the Legend on July 6, 1995, while still offering the straight 5 in both 2.0 L and 2.5 L versions. The profile of this vehicle was reduced somewhat to . The luxury approach was enhanced. A carryover from the previous generation saw marginal increases in length, width, and height dimensions for vehicles installed with the V6 engine, but the smaller dimensions were not in compliance with Japanese government regulations concerning dimensions and maximum engine displacement, thereby giving buyers an incentive in interior accommodations when purchasing the V6 model. Each engine choice obligated the Japanese buyer with increased annual road tax liability, and one trim level package was designated with the engine choice, offering stepped levels of standard and luxury equipment for each selection.. The Inspire, sold at Honda Clio dealerships, was also known as the () and sold at the Honda Verno sales network, and mechanically identical to the UA1-UA3 Inspire. Starting with this generation, all Inspire and Saber vehicles were manufactured at Honda's Marysville Auto Plant in Ohio, USA. November 8, 1996 saw the introduction of dual airbags for front seat passengers and anti-lock brakes as standard. This version of the Inspire competed with the Toyota Camry Gracia, Mark II, Cresta and Chaser, the Nissan Cefiro and Skyline, the Mazda Millenia and the Mitsubishi Diamante. ==Third generation series UA4 and UA5 (1998–2003)== Honda Saber The third generation Honda Inspire/Saber was introduced October 15, 1998, and was the first Honda designed and built in the US and exported to Japan. In North America, this vehicle was sold as the Acura TL, while in Japan it was the second model that accompanied the flagship Honda Legend at Honda Clio Japanese dealerships. The Saber version of this car was sold as the top level sedan at Honda Verno. Honda's internet-based navigation system Internavi was introduced with this generation. The Inspire no longer offered the Straight-5 engine, and instead offered the 3.2 L J32A V6 and 2.5 L J25A V6 with VTEC, and a choice of a 4- or 5-speed automatic transmission. The bodystyle was changed from hardtop to sedan as a result of the USA-spec Accord having been upgraded to meet USA requirements for improved side impact protection. A cabin air filter, also known as a pollen filter is introduced with this generation and is located behind the glove compartment for all vehicles sold internationally. The Honda Saber was discontinued April 2003 along with the consolidation of the Honda Japan sales networks Primo, Clio and Verno. ==Fourth generation series UC1 (2003–2007)== 2005–2007 Honda Inspire The fourth generation was introduced June 18, 2003. This vehicle was built at the Saitama Prefecture facility in Sayama, Japan. The bodystyle and appearance was aligned with the North American Accord. This is the first vehicle that showcases Honda's \\"VCM\\" technology, on the 3.0 L J30A V6 with i-VTEC with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Honda also made available its Intelligent Highway Cruise Control (IHCC), \\"C-MOS\\", which utilized a front-mounted camera to assist in unwanted lane drifting. An Internet-based navigation service called Internavi is available for drivers in Japan. 2003 Honda's Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS, although originally introduced with the initials CMS) introduced in on the Inspire uses a radar-based system to monitor the situation ahead and provide automatic braking if the driver does not react to a warning in the instrument cluster and a tightening of the seat belts. The Honda system was the world's first production system to provide automatic braking. The 2003 Honda system also incorporated an \\"E-Pretensioner\\", which worked in conjunction with the CMBS system with electric motors on the seat belts. When activated, the CMBS has three warning stages. The first warning stage includes audible and visual warnings to brake. If ignored, the second stage would include the E-Pretensioner's tugging on the shoulder portion of the seat belt two to three times as an additional tactile warning to the driver to take action. The third stage, in which the CMBS predicts that a collision is unavoidable, includes full seat belt slack takeup by the E-Pretensioner for more effective seat belt protection and automatic application of the brakes to lessen the severity of the predicted crash. The E-Pretensioner would also work to reduce seat belt slack whenever the brakes are applied and the brake assist system is activated. A styling update appeared on November 4, 2005, changing both the front grille and rear tail lights. LED was introduced for the rear tail lights. In September 2002, a straight-4 DOHC i-VTEC 2.4 L K24A engine was made available on the USA-spec vehicle only. This model was also sold in parts of Southeast Asia as the Honda Accord with the 2.0L, 2.4L and 3.0L I-VTEC engines. ==Fifth generation series CP3 (2007–2012)== Honda Inspire JDM Honda Inspire interior The fifth generation Honda Inspire was released on December 19, 2007 in Japan. Honda technologies such as \\"CMBS\\", Adaptive Cruise Control, called IHCC, and HDD navigation with Honda's telematics subscription service Internavi is included. The power steering is now electric power assisted to reduce power demands on the engine, thereby improving fuel economy. The Inspire has over the previous generations grown in all dimensions in that it is larger than the first and second generation Honda/Acura Legends built between 1985 and 1996, with a larger and more powerful V6 engine. It matches the dimensions of the fourth generation Honda Legend/Acura RL. There are few exterior and interior differences between this Inspire and the Southeast Asian Honda Accord. In Japan, the Inspire competes with the Toyota Crown, and the Nissan Fuga. Sales of the Inspire ended September 2012 in Japan but would continued in 2014 as Proton Perdana in Malaysia. It was replaced by the ninth generation Accord. ==Sixth generation series (2018–present)== The Sixth generation Honda Inspire differs from the Honda Accord from the rear The Sixth generation Honda Inspire shares the same design as the Honda Accord except for the front and rear DRG The sixth generation Inspire was released in 2018 as a sedan designed exclusively for the Chinese market. It is based on the tenth generation Accord with a redesigned front and rear DRG. The sixth generation Inspire is made by Dongfeng Honda to replace the Spirior. ==References== ==External links== * Official Inspire Archive * Inspire Family Tree Inspire Category:2000s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1990 Category:Slanted engines Category:2010s cars ","title":"Honda Inspire"},{"id":"529931","text":"Software law refers to the legal remedies available to protect software-based assets.

After obtaining a first-class mathematics degree as a self- taught external student at the University of London, Wright studied at Jesus College, Oxford and Christ Church, Oxford. His research career lasted from 1931 until the early 1980s, firstly on a Research Fellowship at Christ Church, which included a year in Göttingen, Germany. He was then appointed a lecturer at Christ Church, teaching there until 1935 followed by his appointment as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Aberdeen. He held that chair from 1936 to 1962, except for a break during the war (from 1943 to 1945) when he was seconded to the Air Ministry Intelligence at MI6 headquarters. He became Vice-Principal of the University in 1961 and Principal and Vice- Chancellor from 1962 until he stood down in 1976. He nevertheless continued to work as a Research Fellow at the University until 1983. A building there is named after him in recognition of his service to the university. Wright worked in many different subspecialties, including number theory and graph theory, and published over a hundred papers. Most of his work focused on analytic number theory. ==Honours and awards== He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937 and awarded their Makdougall Brisbane Prize in 1952. He was elected to the London Mathematical Society in 1929 and awarded their Senior Berwick Prize in 1978.

Gibson is active as a professional pilot who currently races regularly at the annual Reno Air Races. ==Personal== Born October 30, 1946, in Cooperstown, New York, but considers the Lakewood area of east Long Beach, California, to be his hometown. On May 30, 1981, he married fellow astronaut, Dr. M. Rhea Seddon of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has four children. He enjoys home-built aircraft, Formula One Air Racing, Unlimited Class Air Racing, running and surfing during his free time. ==Education== Gibson graduated from Huntington High School, Huntington, New York as a part of the class of 1964, and went on to earn an Associate degree in Engineering Science from Suffolk County Community College in 1966. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from California Polytechnic State University in 1969. ==Military career== Gibson entered active duty with the U.S. Navy in 1969. He was commissioned through the Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS), and proceed to flight training. He received basic and primary flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola and Naval Air Station Saufley Field, Florida, and Naval Air Station Meridian, Mississippi. He completed advanced flight training at Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas and was assigned to Fighter Squadron 121 (VF-121) at Naval Air Station Miramar, California for replacement training in the F-4 Phantom II. While assigned to Fighter Squadron 111 (VF-111) and Fighter Squadron 1 (VF-1) from April 1972 to September 1975, he saw duty aboard the aircraft carriers and , flying combat missions in Southeast Asia in the F-4 with VF-111 and making the initial operational carrier deployment of the F-14 Tomcat with VF-1. He is a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as \\"TOPGUN.\\" Gibson returned to the United States and an assignment as an F-14A instructor pilot with Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124) at Naval Air Station Miramar. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland in June 1977 and later became involved in the test and evaluation of improvements to the F-14A aircraft while assigned to the Naval Air Test Center's Strike Aircraft Test Directorate. Selected as a NASA astronaut, he continued to be promoted, eventually achieving the rank of Captain in the U.S. Navy and the rank at which he retired from active naval service. Charles F. Bolden, his copilot on STS-61-C, described Gibson and John Young as the two best pilots he had met \\"in my life in aviation, over thirty-five years; never met two people like them. Everyone else gets into an airplane; John and Hoot wear their airplane. They're just awesome\\". Gibson's flight experience included over 6,000 flying hours (14,000 hours in total) in over 140 types of civil and military aircraft. He holds an airline transport pilot license. In 2006 he was required to stop flying for the airlines because he reached his 60th birthday. He still holds a multi-engine and instrument rating. He has held a private pilot rating since age 17. Gibson has also completed over 300 carrier landings. ==NASA career== Selected by NASA in January 1978, Gibson became an astronaut in August 1979. Gibson flew five missions: STS-41-B in 1984, STS-61-C in 1986, STS-27 in 1988, STS-47 in 1992, and STS-71 in 1995. Gibson served as Chief of the Astronaut Office (December 1992 to September 1994) and as Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations (March–November 1996). On his first space flight, Gibson was the pilot on the crew of STS 41-B which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 3, 1984. The flight accomplished the deployment of two Hughes 376 communications satellites which later failed to reach desired geosynchronous orbits due to upper-stage rocket failures. The STS 41-B mission marked the first checkout of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and Manipulator Foot Restraint (MFR), with Bruce McCandless II and Bob Stewart performing two EVAs (spacewalks). The German Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS), Remote Manipulator System (RMS), six \\"Getaway Specials\\", and materials processing experiments were included on the mission. The eight-day orbital flight of Challenger culminated in the first-ever landing at the Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 1984. Gibson was the commander of the STS-61-C mission, and the first of only four people under the age of 40 to command a STS Orbiter. The seven-man crew on board the Orbiter Columbia launched from the Kennedy Space Center on January 12, 1986. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed the SATCOM Ku satellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. The mission concluded with a successful night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 18, 1986. Gibson subsequently participated in the investigation of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, and also participated in the redesign and recertification of the solid rocket boosters. MMU. It was Gibson who took the photo and later remarked imagining about the caption being \\"NASA Photo by Hooter\\" STS-41-B in 1984 As the commander of STS-27, Gibson and his five-man crew launched from the Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1988, aboard the Orbiter Atlantis. The mission carried a Department of Defense payload, and a number of secondary payloads. After 68 orbits of the Earth the mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base on December 6, 1988. The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damage Atlantis sustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent. On Gibson's fourth space flight, the fiftieth Space Shuttle mission, he served as commander of STS-47, Spacelab-J, which launched on September 12, 1992 aboard the Orbiter Endeavour. The mission was a cooperative venture between the United States and Japan, and included the first Japanese astronaut and the first African-American woman, Mae Jemison, in the crew. During the eight-day flight, the crew focused on life science and materials processing experiments in over forty investigations in the Spacelab laboratory, as well as scientific and engineering tests performed aboard the Orbiter Endeavour. The mission ended with a successful landing on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on September 20, 1992. On his last flight, (June 27 to July 7, 1995), Gibson commanded a crew of seven-members (up) and eight-members (down) on Space Shuttle mission STS-71. This was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. The Atlantis Space Shuttle was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. It also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed various life sciences experiments and data collections. When the hatch separating the two modules was opened, Gibson and Vladimir Dezhurov shook hands, symbolizing the newly-found cooperation between the United States of America and the Russian Federation. Later that day, President Bill Clinton in a statement mentioned that this handshake was a major breakthrough towards the ending of the Cold War. When giving public speeches, Gibson often jokes that he ended the Cold War. In five space flights, Gibson completed a total of 36.5 days in space. ==Post-NASA career == Gibson left NASA in November 1996 and became a pilot for Southwest Airlines. In 2006, as reported by NASA Watch, Gibson was forced to retire as mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration for commercial airline pilots. Gibson has publicly spoken out against federal regulations which require airline pilots to retire at age 60.TOP STORIES  KHOU.com  News for Houston, Texas In December 2006, he joined the Benson Space Company as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Test Pilot. Gibson has flown 111 different aircraft types, and has become a regular competitor at the annual Reno Air Races. In 1998, Gibson flying the Hawker Sea Fury \\"Riff-Raff\\" won the Unlimited Class in the Inaugural Running of the EAA AirVenture Cup Race. In October 2007, Gibson was a contestant on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. During his appearance, he became the first contestant to make it to the million-dollar question without using any of his cheats. He incorrectly answered the $1,000,000 question (\\"How many factors do 32 and 28 share?\\"). The correct answer is three; 1, 2, and 4. He answered with two (2 and 4). All of his prize money ($25,000) went to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. Hawker Sea Fury aka September Fury race 232 Beginning in 2009, Gibson flew as a demonstration pilot for Hawker Beechcraft Corporation to showcase the Premier 1A light business jet across the United States and overseas. In 2010, The Academy of Model Aeronautics, the United States' national aeromodeling organization, named Gibson a spokesperson and Ambassador to promote the hobby of radio controlled model flight and to encourage an interest in aviation amongst young people. Gibson has stated that his interest in manned flight and his career as a test pilot and astronaut has its origin in his building of model aircraft as a youth. Gibson remains an avid radio controlled model hobbyist and is reportedly constructing a flyable version of the experimental vertical take off and landing Convair XFY-1 Pogo of the 1950s. In September 2013, Gibson qualified the Hawker Sea Fury known as \\"September Fury\\" in race #232 at the 50th National Championship Air Races at a speed of 479.164 mph. This is the fastest Sea Fury qualifying time. In September 2015, Gibson qualified the P51-D, known as \\"Strega\\" at the 52nd National Championship Air Races at a speed of 475.043. With a little bit of luck and some epic flying, Robert Lee \\"Hoot\\" Gibson took the checkered flag in the Gold Unlimited Race finishing at 488.983 mph average speed.

Springer Science & Business Media; 1966. . p. 365–. From 1885-1889 he served in the conservative Protestant Reform Party government of Sir Robert Thorburn. The Reform Party collapsed and Thorburn went into opposition as leader of the new Tory Party. Goodridge's Tories lost the 1893 election to the Liberals led by Sir William Whiteway. However, the Tories complained that Whiteway's Liberals had promised jobs to Newfoundlanders who voted for him and filed petitions in the Supreme Court under the Corrupt Practices Act against fifteen Liberal members of the House alleging bribery and corruption. The members were tried and found guilty and their seats were declared vacant. In April 1894, in the midsts of the trials, Whiteway attempted to dissolve the House of Assembly and call new elections. Instead, Governor Sir Arthur Murray refused Whiteway's requested and instead appointed Goodridge as the new Premier despite the fact that Goodridge's Tories were outnumbered by Liberals in the House of Assembly.\\"Bond Moves Past Bribery Charges, Becomes Prime Minister\\".

The City's Economic Development commission considers it the #1 Tourist Destination in the City.Falls Church EDC Presentation on official City Website The center is home to 120+ shops, restaurants and businesses catering extensively to the Asian American, especially the Vietnamese-American, population. Eden Center has created an anchor for Vietnamese culture serving the Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania areas, as evidenced by the large number of phở soup restaurants, bánh mì delicatessens, bakeries, markets, as well as Vietnamese-American cultural events that are regularly held at the Center. Eden Center is the largest Vietnamese commercial center on the East Coast, and the largest Asian-themed mall on the east coast of North America. ==History== The center opened in 1962 as the Plaza Seven Shopping Center, with a Grand Union supermarket and a Zayre discount store serving as anchors. After the Grand Union store closed in 1984, Vietnamese merchants displaced from the \\"Little Saigon\\" area in the Clarendon neighborhood of nearby Arlington, Virginia, due to Washington Metro subway construction and redevelopment moved into the space, as the Vietnamese-American community in Northern Virginia (and the Washington, DC, metropolitan area) grew following the Vietnam War. The name derives from the 1960s Saigon arcade Khu Eden; the cluster of stores took on the Eden name, and it ultimately evolved into the name for the entire center. The landlord, Capital Commercial Properties, later added a clock tower and an arch flanked by lions, inspired by the Bến Thành Market in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. ==Layout== Most businesses are located on ground level and offer direct access to the sidewalk and parking lot, as would a conventional strip mall. Additionally, approximately 65 stores and restaurants are contained inside three enclosed malls. In the rear of the mall are located two businesses, including a nightclub and Planet Fitness gym. Parking is contained largely in the front, with approximately 900 spaces. Parking in the rear of businesses number an additional 300 spaces. At all times, a South Vietnamese Flag flies proudly above the mall, as is common with many Vietnamese-owned businesses in the Washington, D.C., area. ==Stores== A 44,000 square foot Good Fortune supermarket opened in November 2014. A variety of business types exist within Eden Center, a few of which incorporate \\"Eden\\" into the name of the business. Most businesses are food-related, either as restaurants, supermarkets and specialty delicatessens catering prepared foods. A high percentage of the businesses in the mall are restaurants, specifically Vietnamese restaurants, specializing in various levels of formality and in various aspects of Vietnamese cuisine. These range from carry-out-only places that serve stir-fry dishes and spring rolls to high-volume phở soup restaurants to sit-down restaurants with large varied menus and a formal decor. Other business types exist, including jewelry stores, herbal medicine shops, clothing and toy stores and travel agents, though these are less numerous. ==Events== Eden Center hosts an annual Tết, or Vietnamese New Year festival and an annual Moon Festival, both widely attended with a vibrant display of special food, performers, fireworks and lion dancing. Each September the Eden Center plays host to the annual \\"Miss Vietnam DC\\" scholarship pageant, the preeminent contest of its kind in the Washington DC area. ==Security== A number of crimes have plagued the Eden Center in its nearly thirty years of operation. As a result, swift police investigations have ensued, and deficiencies in security have been addressed. ===Notable incidents=== In 1997, after a fatal shooting, the Falls Church Police Department opened a substation at Eden Center. The property landlord also began operating 48 closed-circuit monitoring cameras.Falls Church Targets Crime at Shopping Center On August 11, 2011, law enforcement consisting of federal, Virginia State and local police jointly raided several businesses in Eden Center, seizing more than $1 million in cash from one business, and small amounts from other businesses. Also seized were several gambling machines and arrested 19 people on suspicion of gambling and alcohol crimes. Police blamed the Dragon Family gang, a Vietnamese-American criminal gang that operates in Asian-American hubs across North America. No felony charges were ever filed, and ultimately, though some defendants pleaded guilty, many had their cases dismissed prior to trial and tensions were ignited between the Eden Center businesses and the City of Falls Church government. At least one defendant went to trial and was found not guilty of the charges. Those tensions continued when a second raid was conducted only 5 months later, and suspects were arrested on a variety of gambling and money laundering charges, with many in the community alleging racism and poor investigation on the part of the police. ==Reviews== On January 19, 2009, an episode of the show, Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, which was focused on the Washington, DC area, showcased the Eden Center. In particular, Bourdain visited the Song Que deli, and had a very favorable review of both that business and of the Eden Center. Many other reviews of Eden Center restaurants have been published in The Washington Post, Washingtonian Magazine, and the Falls Church News Press. ==References== ==See also== *Seven Corners, Virginia *Leesburg Pike *Little Saigon Category:Asian-American culture in Virginia Category:Buildings and structures in Falls Church, Virginia Category:Shopping malls in Virginia Category:Tourist attractions in Falls Church, Virginia Category:Shopping malls established in 1984 Category:Vietnamese-American history Category:1984 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Eden Center"},{"id":"529947","text":"Cosby is an American sitcom television series broadcast on CBS from September 16, 1996, until April 28, 2000. The program starred Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad, who had previously worked together in the 1984–1992 NBC sitcom The Cosby Show. Madeline Kahn portrayed their neighborly friend, Pauline, until her death in 1999. The series is loosely based on the British sitcom One Foot in the Grave airing on BBC from 1990 until 2001. This was also the second and final sitcom that Madeline Kahn made for The Carsey-Werner Company, her first being Oh Madeline (based on the British sitcom Pig in the Middle) in 1983. ==Premise== Set at corner of 33rd Ave and 1539 Blake St.S01 E09 - No Nudes is Good Nudes Astoria in Queens, Cosby portrayed grumpy Hilton Lucas, a New York City man forced into early retirement from his job as an airline customer service agent. His wife Ruth was again played by Phylicia Rashad. Initially, Telma Hopkins was cast as Ruth Lucas; however, she was recast after she reacted poorly to Cosby's tendency to ad libitum. The couple had one daughter, Erica Lucas, initially portrayed by Audra McDonald and later portrayed by T'Keyah Crystal Keymáh. Doug E. Doug played Griffin Vesey, a foster son the Lucas family took in when he was younger. Griffin occasionally tried to win Erica's affections, but they decided just to remain friends when in the fourth and final season, Darien Sills-Evans portrayed Darien Evans, Erica's fiancé/husband. Jurnee Smollett also joined the cast as 11-year-old Jurnee, whom Hilton adored. The show was based on the concept from the BBC series One Foot in the Grave, starring Richard Wilson and Annette Crosbie. David Renwick, the creator and writer of One Foot in the Grave, was listed as a consultant of Cosby. One Foot in the Grave was notable for containing dark humor for a mainstream sitcom. The tone was significantly lightened for Cosby, although certain controversial scenes, such as a scene in which the lead character incinerates a live tortoise, albeit by accident, were recreated (though, in this version, with a turtle). A notable later episode was the fourth-season premiere, \\"My Spy\\", which showed Hilton watching an episode of I Spy (the 1960s series in which Cosby co-starred) and then dreaming an adventure with Robert Culp's character from that series; the episode ends with a brief dream sequence in which Rashad dreams she is playing her previous character from The Cosby Show. The same season also presented an episode entitled \\"Loving Madeline\\" which featured the standard opening credits for the series but was in fact a tribute to Kahn featuring the cast members out of character discussing the recently deceased actress, punctuated by clips from past episodes. Cosby premiered to an audience of more than 24.7 million viewers, but averaged 16 million viewers during the course of the season. As the series progressed, ratings shrank and CBS, fresh with new hit comedies in Everybody Loves Raymond and The King of Queens, decided to move the series from Monday to Wednesday Friday night death slot. The moves led to a drop in ratings. At the end of the fourth season, having accumulated 100 episodes, Cosby and CBS executive Les Moonves mutually decided to end the series. The last episode, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", aired on April 28, 2000, and was the 96th episode to be produced and broadcast, drawing just over 7 million viewers. ==Episodes== ==Cast== *Bill Cosby — Hilton Lucas *Phylicia Rashad — Ruth Lucas *T'Keyah Crystal Keymáh — Erica Lucas *Doug E.

TBS shortly thereafter ran reruns of the series for about two years. In March 2010, Up TV (the current UP Network) began airing the show, but as a family network with religious ownership, removed some episodes and edited some content in episodes to meet the network's mores. It began to air on Bounce TV in January 2015, but was removed from air on July 7, 2015, when records were made public regarding Bill Cosby's sexual assault cases. Two seasons are available through Hoopla. All 4 seasons are available for streaming on Amazon Prime. ==Nielsen ratings== Cosby was considered to be a ratings success for CBS, winning its time slot of Monday, 8:00 PM in households and viewers for the first three seasons. { class= - !Season !Timeslot (EST) !Episodes !Rank !Viewers - 1  – May 19, 1997) 25 #21 16.0 - 2  – May 18, 1998)  24 #28 13.8 - 3  – May 17, 1999) 25 #35 12.5 - 4  / – April 28, 2000) 21 #82 8.4 } ==Awards and nominations== { class= - !Year !Award !Result !Category !Recipient - 1997rowspan=2 style=\\"min-width:8em\\"BMI Film & TV Awardsrowspan=2WonBMI TV Music AwardBill Cosby and Benny Golson - 1998BMI TV Music AwardBill Cosby and Benny Golson - 1997rowspan=2Emmy AwardNominatedOutstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a SeriesTheodore Ashton, Neal Carlos, Tom Conkright, Stephen A.

A mixture of hand-to-hand fighting and ranged combat resulted in the British occupying this key position around the Argentine garrison at Port Stanley. ==BackgroundBritish forces=== The British force consisted of Third Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 PARA), under Lieutenant Colonel Hew Pike. Artillery support came from six 105mm L118 light guns of 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery, and the 4.5-in gun of the Type 21 frigate, . Second Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 PARA) were held in reserve. ===Argentine forces=== The Argentine forces consisted of B Company, 7th Infantry Regiment (RI 7), part of 10th Mechanized Infantry Brigade, as well as detachments from other units. The local Argentine commander was the 34-year-old Major Carlos Carrizo Salvadores, the second-in- command of RI 7.Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present, Volume 1, David Marley, p.1076, ABC- CLIO, 28/02/2008 The 7th Infantry Regiment, reinforced by two Marine Infantry platoons, held Mount Longdon, Wireless Ridge to the northwest of the Capital, Port Stanley and to their east, Cortley Ridge. Marine Teniente de Navío (naval rank equivalent to army captain) Sergio Andrés Dachary had arrived at Mount Longdon in the week preceding the battle and was on hand to control the Marine-manned heavy machine-guns and protecting riflemen there.Batallón 5: El Batallón de Infantería de Marina No. 5 en la Guerra de las Malvinas, Emilio Villarino, p.93, Aller Atucha, 1992 The Argentine forces on Mount Longdon were recalled reservists with a year of military training. Part of this training saw 7th Regiment undertake major, all-arms collective training in central Argentina alongside the 3rd and 6th Infantry Regiments of the 10th Brigade.\\"Towards the end of October 1981, Brigadier-General Jofre laid on a major exercise in which the fully armed and equipped 10th Infantry Brigade pushed its way north and west towards the General Acha training area in La Pampa province high on the lower slopes of the Andes about 1,000 kilometres from Buenos Aires. The climax came with a brigade mechanized infantry assault, while overhead Skyhawks, representing both friendly and enemy air support, strafed hulks with rockets. The Argentinian Army Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant-General Roberto Viola, paid close attention to the performance of the brigade. It tested the men. \\" 5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, p.29, Leo Cooper, 2003 The young RI 7 soldiers were not going to abandon their positions easily and several were prepared to hold their ground. They possessed fully automatic FN FAL rifles, FAP light machine guns and PAMS sub-machine guns; these weapons delivered more firepower than the British L1A1 rifle (SLR). They were also equipped with FN MAG 7.62mm general purpose machineguns, which were almost identical to those of the Paras. At their San Miguel del Monte training camp the 7th Regiment companies prepared for a possible war against Chile and carried out helicopter drills with the 601st Combat Aviation Battalion.Major Carlos Carrizo Salvadores recalled that: \\"During 1981 the Regiment was selected to take part in an exercise with 601st Combat Aviation Battalion. This was a terrific opportunity for the rifle companies to work with the Army Aviation and it was excellent value. \\" 5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, p.29, Leo Cooper, 2003 Some fifty of the 7th Regiment were to fight more resolutely than the rest and share their skills, having been put through a commando course organized by commando-trained Major Oscar Jaimet,\\"He was an Army commando who had fought against the People's Revolutionary Army in Tucuman province during the 'Dirty War'. Thoroughly professional and a dedicated soldier, he expected high standards and exercised rigid but fair discipline. It was to Jaimet that Brigadier-General Jofre turned to when he wanted a heli-borne company. \\" 5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, p.161, Leo Cooper, 2003 the Operations Officer of the 6th Infantry Regiment (RI 6). Private Jorge Altieri in an interview after the war told how he trained hard (under training organized by Drill-Sergeant Pedro Maciel ReyesPrograma 32 - 9 de Agosto 2018 (Malvinas Su Historia) with B Company: > I was issued with a FAL 7.62 rifle. Other guys were given FAP light > machineguns – and others got PAMS [sub-machineguns]. The main emphasis in > shooting was making every bullet count. I was also shown how to use a > bazooka, how to make and lay booby-traps, and how to navigate at night, and > we went on helicopter drills, night and day attacks and ambushes.Vincent > Bramley, Two Sides of Hell, p. 9, Bloomsbury Publishing Limited, 1994; > published in Argentina as Los Dos Lados Del Infierno Altieri of Sub Lieutenant Juan Domingo Baldini's 1st Platoon would also claim the conscripts experienced hunger, despite permission to go through stockpiled rations on Mount Longdon: > During wartime, the higher ranking officers are in totally different places > ... Sub Lieutenant Baldini would receive orders from Major Carrizo who was > further down, to use our cold rations and that the more nutritious food we'd > get when the fighting started because they didn't know if they'd be able to > supply us with food. From 16 April to 11 June we fought, we'd have soup with > lentils, green peas and some piece of mutton. We would tell our officer: \\"We > can't tell the British soldiers to wait so that we could get better food and > then start shooting ... We weren't properly fed prior to the fighting like > we should've been, we were weakened.VGM Jorge “Beto” Altieri: “Yo defendí a > la Patria y la Patria no me defiende… Yo necesito a la Patria…” The experiences in Baldini's platoon varied from soldier to soldier. Private Luis Aparicio claims that he and others once escaped into Port Stanley where they were able to buy cigarettes, jam, bread, apples and cookies and that the corporal in charge of his group would allow them to shoot and eat sheep, but that in the last 20 days they hardly got any food. He also admits that the 1st Platoon was taken out of the mountain twice, in April and at the beginning of May, so that the soldiers could get a chance to shower in Port Stanley and that on the last march into town, the men were allowed to stay there under roofs overnight. Private Carlos Amato claims that Baldini had a net stretched outside his tent that contained tinned provisions for his men, but claims these rations were of poor quality, although he would consume them after getting a fellow conscript to heat them up first and that the NCOs in the platoon had no qualms in eating the cold rations made available to everybody in 1st Platoon. Sergio Delgado claims that he hated his section leader, Corporal Geronimo Diaz of the 1st Platoon, but says that the NCO allowed him and four other conscripts to open up and drink several cans of beer that had been helicoptered forward. Private Alberto Carbone claims that Baldini would always get him to go and look for firewood so that the officer could heat up his food while the remainder of the platoon \\"starved\\" and that Baldini \\"clashed with everyone\\" and was left to himself and \\"died alone\\" as a result. Subteniente Baldini is accused of having handed out field punishment to a number of conscripts for abanding their posts to go looking for food. \\"Our own officers were our greatest enemies\\", says Ernesto Alonso of Baldini's platoon who later became the president of CECIM, an anti-war veterans group founded by Rodolfo Carrizo and former conscripts of the 7th Regiment. \\"They supplied themselves with whiskey from the pubs, but they weren’t prepared for war. They disappeared when things got serious.\\" Argentina's Falklands War Veterans. 'Cannon Fodder in a War We Couldn't Win'. By Jens Glüsing. Der Spiegel, 4 March 2007 Alonso also claims the conscripts on Mount Longdon fought “without any type of leadership by our commanders, the officers and NCOs.\\" Alonso admits he took no part in the fighting for he was evacuated during the daylight hours of 11 June, a victim of shell-shock during an artillery bombardment. The previous day, Private Carbone had also been evacuated after he shot himself in his left thigh while inside his tent as is revealed in the book Two Sides of Hell (Bloomsbury Publishing, 1994). Baldini applied first- aid and allowed the conscript to be taken down the mountain, where a helicopter arrived to take the wounded soldier to Stanley Hospital, but not before coming under rifle fire from nervous Argentine sentries on Wireless Ridge that damaged the helicopter. British Warrant Officer Nick van der Bijl (who interviewed Argentine POWs), maintains that the defenders on Longdon were helped to make themselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and that their officers, including Baldini, tried hard to bolster morale: > Baldini was later heavily criticized by veterans for being indifferent and > selfish toward his men although this seems to have come from several > petulant soldiers who failed to appreciate his efforts to keep them alive in > difficult conditions.Nicholas van der Bijl, Nine Battles to Stanley, p. 155, > Leo Cooper, 1994 Baldini was reported to have handed cups of hot chocolate milk to his sodden conscripts in late May 1982. In 2016, Victor José Bruno (former 7th Regiment private) spoke in defence of Subteniente Baldini, claiming that the officer would happily share his cigarettes with the smokers in his platoon and that Baldini, although suffering from the onset of a serious case of trench foot, refused to be evacuated.Malvinas Banda de Hermanos Regimiento Infantería 7 (Programa 37 - Sábado 6/08/2016) In 2009, Argentine authorities in Comodoro Rivadavia ratified a decision made by authorities in Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego (which, according to Argentina, have authority over the islands), announcing their intention to charge 70 officers and NCOs with inhumane treatment of conscript soldiers during the war.Confirman el juzgamiento por torturas en Malvinas, (In Spanish), Clarín, Buenos Aires, 27 June 2009 \\"We have testimony from 23 people about a soldier who was shot to death by a corporal, four other former combatants who starved to death, and at least 15 cases of conscripts who were staked out on the ground\\", Pablo Vassel, president of the Human Rights Department of the province of Corrientes, told Inter Press Service News Agency.ARGENTINA: Soldiers Report Torture, Murder - By Superiors - in Malvinas. By Marcela Valente. IPS The conscript that was supposedly \\"shot to death\\", has been identified as Marine Private Rito Portillo, who according to the military surgeon that attended him (Major Andino Luis Francisco), was shot in error on the night of 4–5 May when returning to his tent from nearby latrines.Recuerdo el nombre de un soldado que murió, al que yo mismo enterré. Se llamaba Rito Portillo, un morochito de Marina. Vino muy mal herido, tenía una profunda herida en el abdomen con exposición de vísceras. Lo atendimos pero... Llegué a conversar bastante con él. Lo único que me decía es que eso le dolía mucho. No lloraba, no gritaba, no se quejaba en forma desmesurada. Se murió mansamente, mansamente... No dijo ninguna frase heroica ni nada. Solo se murió mansamente, diciendo que a él le dolía. No fue ningún sargento Cabral ni nada por el estilo. Se murió, pero lo hizo sin gritos, hasta sin demagogia. Humildemente, como debe haber sido su vida... Asi quisiera morirme yo, de la misma manera.(HECTOR RUBEN SIMEONI, Malvinas: Contrahistoria, páginas 152/153, Editorial Inédita, 1984) There are serious claims that false testimonies were used as evidence in accusing the Argentine officers and NCOs and Vassel had to step down from his post in 2010. Since the 2009 announcement was made, no one in the military or among the retired officers and NCOs has been charged, causing Pablo Vassel in April 2014 to comment: > For over two years we've been waiting for a final say on behalf of the > courts ... There are some types of crimes that no state should allow to go > unpunished, no matter how much time has passed, such as the crimes of the > dictatorship.

It didn't take into account his age or rank. In 2016, retired-Colonel Horacio Sánchez Mariño (former 601 Combat Aviation Battalion pilot), in an online newspaper article criticized the anti-war veterans' group CECIM for accusing the Argentine Army of dereliction of duty, accusing the veterans association of being caranchos (vultures) that lived off the Argentine dead.Los caranchos de nuestros muertos y heridos de Malvinas ==BattleBritish advance=== 3 PARA and the supporting Royal Engineers from the 9th Parachute Squadron\\"Ahead of the main body, 2 Troop under Captain Robbie Burns was already ashore and had completed the long walk to Port Stanley with 3 Commando Brigade; 2 Troop claims to be the only 3 Commando Brigade unit to walk all the way to Stanley.\\" The Paratroopers, Ashley Brown, Jonathan Reed, p. 124, National Historical Society, 1990 made a desperate march across the hills north of Mount Simon to seize the key piece of high ground above the settlement of Estancia, also known as Estancia House.

He set up a patrol base in the area of the Murrell Bridge, protected by 4 Platoon from B Company. The Battalion's patrols staged through this patrol base, reducing the distance that they had to travel to reach Mount Longdon and return to the main position each night.\\" 3 Commando Brigade in the Falklands, Julian Thomson, Pen & Sword, 2008 From their forward operating base, Selfridge and Burns sent out patrols to scout out and harass the Argentine positions on Mount Longdon. A Royal Engineer of 2 Troop (Lance- Corporal Hare) was seriously wounded while on patrol with 3 PARA.\\"Not long after, they heard that Lance-Corporal Hare of 2 Troop had been seriously wounded while on patrol with 3 Para.\\" The Paratroopers, Ashley Brown, Jonathan Reed, p. 124, National Historical Society, 1990 Terry Peck, a former FIDF member also carried out patrolling, and in early June, while pretending to have gotten lost while riding his motorbike, he chatted to a group of five conscripts (under Corporal Geronimo Diaz of Baldini's 1st Platoon) that had been tasked with guarding provisions that had been helicoptered forward and were relaxing in the sun after drinking several cans of beer on the eastern end of Mount Longdon.Not long after this successful foray, Peck while guiding a close-target-reconnaissance patrol (under Corporal Peter Hadden) opened fire in error at Sergeant John Pettinger's standing patrol also from 3 PARA's D Company, but no British casualties were registered in this friendly fire incident.He was patrolling with Corporal Pete Hadden when another group of men emerged from the gloom. A no-go corridor had been agreed to avoid blue-on-blue incidents, but Terry had led Hadden's group across it. Recognising the approaching patrol, Sergeant John Pettinger told his team to hold its fire. But Terry was not so cautious and fired several rifle rounds at the 'enemy'.Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, Graham Bound, p. 189, Casemate Publishers, 2007 On the night of 4–5 June, a British three-man patrol from D Company (consisting of Corporal Jerry Phillips and Privates Richard Absolon and Bill Hayward) was sent out to the northern slopes of Mount Longdon,Hugh Bicheno, Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War, p. 213, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006 detailed to penetrate Sub-Lieutenant Juan Baldini's 1st Platoon on the western slopes to secure a prisoner — supported to their rear by a battery of six 105 mm field guns, under cover of which the specialist snipers shot at Baldini, while another fired a 66mm anti- tank rocket at one of the 1st Platoon mortar pits (under Corporal Óscar Carrizo). The Argentine commanders reacted quickly and the British patrol found themselves under accurate machine gun, artillery and mortar fire. There were no Argentine casualties, although one British participant claimed to have shot and killed two Argentines and demolished the mortar crew with a rocket at close range. On the Argentine side, it was soon realised that the 7th Infantry Regiment Reconnaissance Platoon (under Second Lieutenant Francisco Ramón Galíndez Matienzo) on the surrounding Wireless Ridge position were in no condition to carry out their own patrolling, for they had been designated the Argentine reserve on Wireless Ridge. Thus the Argentine Commando units, normally used for deep-recce [reconnaissance] had to take on this role. They were able to do so with some success. In the early hours of 7 June, a combined patrol of the 601 Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron, investigating reports from Major Jaimet of enemy activity around there, approached the Murrell Bridge.Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.163, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 After several nights in the area, Corporals Peter Hadden and Mark Brown and their patrols had just arrived at the bluff on the western bank of the Murrell River, which Sergeant Ian Addle's patrol was using as a base.PARA!, p. 345, by Peter Harclerode Within a short time, a sentry reported moving figures down near the bridge. The Paras opened up and a confused firefight developed in the darkness, with small arms, machine gun, British LAW rockets and Argentine Energa rifle grenades being exchanged. Captain Rubén Teófilo Figueroa's 2nd Assault Section (from 601 Commando Company) was very aggressive, and before dawn forced the Paras to withdraw while leaving behind most of their equipment.Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.164, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 Argentine Sergeant Rubén Poggi was slightly wounded during the Argentine counter-ambush.Comandos en acción: el Ejército en Malvinas, Isidoro Ruiz Moreno, p.328, Emecé Editores, 01/01/1986 The official history of the Parachute Regiment acknowledges: > They were forced to evacuate their position rapidly, leaving behind their > packs and radio, but succeeded in withdrawing without suffering any > casualties. The location was checked on the evening of 8 June by another > patrol, but there was no sign of the packs or radio, which meant the > battalion's radio net could have been compromised. From then on, British patrols had to be mounted closer to their own lines. That same night, another 8-man section (under Corporal Oscar Nicolás Albornoz- Guevara), from the 4th Regiment's C Company on nearby Two Sisters Mountain, attempted to map out the British positions in the Estancia House area; but British lookouts detected this force and 3 PARA's Mortar Platoon repelled the Argentine patrol.Volveremos!, Jorge R. Farinella, p. 125, Editorial Rosario, 1984 Nevertheless, despite evidence of aggressive Argentine patrolling, Colonel Pike and his company commanders on the eve of battle still held the Argentine regulars in low regard and did not expect them to put up much resistance. For this reason, the British hoped to surprise the Argentine commanders by advancing as close to their forward platoon as possible under cover of darkness, before rushing the Argentine trenches. The three major objectives – 'Fly Half', 'Full Back' and 'Wing Forward' – were named after positions in Rugby football. B Company would attack through 'Fly Half' and proceed to 'Full Back', while A Company, followed by C Company if necessary, would do the same on Wireless Ridge.Christian Jennings & Adrian Weale, Green- Eyed Boys: 3 PARA & The Battle For Mount Longdon, p. 187 But morale was still reasonably strong in the 7th Regiment. Private Fabián Passaro of B Company served on Longdon with Baldini's 1st Platoon and remembers life at the time: > Most of us had adjusted to what we'd been landed in, we'd adjusted to the > war. But some boys [identified in the book \\"Two Sides Of Hell/Los Dos Lados > Del Infierno\\"] were still very depressed and, in many cases, were getting > worse all the time.

British sappers subsequently counted some 1,500 anti-personnel mines that Lieutenant Diego Arreseigor's platoon of Sappers from the 10th Mechanized Engineer Company had laid along the western and northern slopes of Mount Longdon, but only two exploded recalled Corporal Peter Cuxson,Twilight Warriors: Inside the World's Special Forces. St Martin Press, 1995 because the rest were frozen. Otherwise, the final battle for Port Stanley would have been an altogether different story. ===Assault on Longdon=== As dusk set-in, 3 PARA moved to their start lines and, after a brief stop, began to make the four-hour-long advance on their objectives. As B Company approached Mount Longdon, Corporal Brian Milne stepped on a mine or was hit by an Argentine rifle grenade, which, alerted Sub-Lieutenant Baldini's platoon who emerged from their tents to lay down fire just as Lieutenant Ian Bickerdike's No. 4 Platoon reached their positions. Corporal Stewart McLaughlin was seen clearing out an Argentine 7.62mm machine gun from the high ground overlooking the western slopes. Lieutenant Jonathan Shaw's No. 6 Platoon, on the right flank of B Company, captured the summit of 'Fly Half' with no fighting. However, they had missed a number of Argentine troops from the 3rd Platoon and these launched an attack on the rear of the unsuspecting platoon, resulting in a number of casualties before the area was cleared. For three hours the hand-to-hand combat raged in the 1st Platoon sector until the Paras drove out the defenders. All around the 1st Platoon position, small groups of soldiers were fighting for their lives. Privates Ben Gough and Dominic Gray managed to crawl undetected up to an Argentine bunker and crouched beside it as the Marine conscripts inside fired at the British. The two Paras each 'posted' a grenade through the firing slit of the bunker. Then jumped in the bunker and started to bayonet the two Marines. Private Gray killed a Marine by sticking his bayonet through his eye socket. They were both mentioned in despatches. Marine Corporal Carlos Rafael Colemil was part of the forward defence and fought as a sniper: > A British soldier climbed over the rock which supported the accommodation > bunker of the 105mm gun crew, and from here he was silhouetted. He screamed > like he was giving out orders. I aimed and fired and he fell, then Conscript > Daniel Ferrandis alerted me to the approach of three British soldiers on the > flank. I observed with a night sight; they were very close. I saw one of > them was carrying a gun with a bipod; he fell at the first shot and shouted. > Another man approached him and I fired again and also got him ... Many > people fell to the ground screaming, but soon the enemy was aware of my > presence and every time I fired a shot I received a great deal of fire in > response. Not long after my main action, I was wounded ... We could also > hear the cries for help from the Rasit radar operator Sergeant Roque Nista, > who was wounded. I could hear Sergeant Omar Cabral, who was a sniper: he was > also firing.James O'Connell, Three Days in June, p.?, Kindle edition, 2014 According to the account of Private Victor José Bruno, Baldini was killed as he tried to unjam a machinegun. \\"The Lieutenant pushed us back and stood up trying to unlock the barrel but then he was shot in his belly by enemy fire\\", he recalled in an interview with Eduardo César Gerding of the Nottingham Malvinas Group. Corporal Dario Ríos was found lying dead with his platoon commander, which disproves Private Carbone's claim that Baldini \\"died alone\\". Baldini's weapon and boots were removed for the use of British soldiers.Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.173, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 Also killed in the initial fighting was Cavalry Sergeant Jorge Alberto Ron (according to Private Altieri who was wounded in the blast that killed the NCOVGM Jorge \\"Beto\\" Altieri: \\"Yo defendí a la Patria y la Patria no me defiende… Yo necesito a la Patria…\\"BAHIANOTICIAS.COM 02/04/2009) and the Argentine forward artillery observation officer, Lieutenant Alberto Rolando Ramos, whose last message was that his position was surrounded. Sub-Lieutenant Baldini was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal.  Argentine reinforcements  Just as it seemed as if the Paras would overwhelm 2nd Lieutenant Enrique Neirotti's 3rd Platoon on the southern half and Staff Sergeant Raúl González's 2nd Platoon on the northern half of the mountain, reinforcements from 2nd Lieutenant Hugo Quiroga's 1st Platoon, 10th Engineer Company on 'Full Back' arrived to help Neirotti and González. Throughout the initial fighting in this sector, most of the Argentine positions on the saddle of the mountain held, the newly arrived engineers using rifle mounted night sights, proving particularly deadly to the Paras. Private Nick Rose in 6 Platoon resumes the story: > Pete Gray stood up and went to throw a grenade and he was shot by a sniper > in his left forearm. We thought the grenade had gone off. We punched his arm > down onto the ground to staunch the bleeding, believing he'd lost half his > right forearm and hand, but it was still there and his arm bent at the > forearm instead of the elbow – a horrible thing to watch. ...There's > 'incoming' everywhere, loads of stuff going down the range and then 'bang' > my pal \\"Fester\\" [Tony Greenwood], gets it just above his left eye, only a > yard away from me. That was a terrible thing. 'Fester' was such a lovely > guy. Then it was 'Baz' Barratt. 'Baz' had gone back to try to get field > dressings for Pete Grey and [as] he was coming back, 'bang', he got it in > the back. This was when we just stalled as a platoon. (Jon Cooksey, op. > cit., p. 66) The battle was going badly for Major Mike Argue. Argentine resistance was strong and well organized. At the centre of the mountain were Marine conscripts Jorge Maciel and Claudio Scaglione in a bunker with a heavy machinegun and Marine conscripts Luis Fernández and Sergio Giuseppetti with night-scope equipped rifles. As Lieutenant Bickerdike, his signaller and Sergeant Ian McKay and a number of other men in No. 4 Platoon were performing reconnaissance on the Marine position, the platoon commander and signaller were wounded. Sergeant McKay realising something needed to be done decided to attack the Marine position that was causing so much damage. The assault was met by a hail of fire. Corporal Ian Bailey was seriously wounded, a Private was killed and another wounded. Despite these losses Sergeant McKay, with complete disregard for his own safety for which he was to win a posthumous Victoria Cross, continued to charge the enemy position alone, lobbing grenades, and was killed. Peter Harclerode who was granted open access to the war diary of the 3rd Battalion and subsequently wrote PARA! (Arms & Armour Press, 1993), pointed out that McKay and his team cleared several Marine riflemen from the position but didn't neutralize the heavy machinegun. Later, Corporal McLaughlin managed to crawl to within grenade-throwing range of the Marine heavy-machinegun team, but despite several efforts with fragmentation grenades and 66 mm rockets, he was also unable to silence it.Christian Jennings and Adrian Weale, Green-Eyed Boys: 3 Para and the Battle for Mount Longdon, p. 142, HarperCollins, 1996 Major Carrizo-Salvadores on 'Full Back' had remained in touch with the Argentine commanders in Port Stanley: > Around midnight I asked RHQ for infantry reinforcements, and I was given a > rifle platoon from Captain Hugo García's C Company. First Lieutenant Raúl > Fernando Castañeda gathered the sections of his platoon, hooked around First > Sergeant Raúl González's 2nd Platoon that was already fighting and delivered > a counterattack [at about 2 am local time]. The Platoon fought with great > courage in fierce hand-to-hand combat and the battle raged for two more > hours, but gradually the enemy broke contact and withdrew while being > engaged by artillery strikes.Crónica de las Grandes Batallas del Ejército > Argentino: Historia de Caballeros Valientes y Desdichados, Alberto Jorge > Maffey, p. 348, Círculo Militar, 2000  Argentine counterattack  It was now the turn of the Argentines to counterattack. Major Carrizo-Salvadores manoeuvred Castañeda's reinforced platoon to close with 4 and 5 Platoons; meanwhile, under the direction of Corporal Jorge Daniel Arribas, part of Castañeda's platoon converged on the British aid post. Colour Sergeant Brian Faulkner, seeing that more than 20 wounded Paras on the western slopes of the mountain were about to fall into the hands of Corporal Arribas, deployed anyone fit enough to defend the position. > \\"I picked four blokes and got up on this high feature, and as I did so this > troop of twenty or thirty Argentines [in fact a reinforced section of just > fifteen riflemen under Corporal Arribas] were coming towards us. We just > opened fire on them.

Peter Harclerode, a noted British historian of the Parachute Regiment, went on record, saying that: > under covering fire, Nos. 4 and 5 Platoons withdrew, but another man was > killed and others wounded in the process. At that point, Lieutenant Colonel > Hew Pike and his 'R' Group arrived on the scene and Major Argue briefed him > on the situation. Shortly afterwards, Company Sergeant-Major Weeks reported > that both platoons had pulled back to a safe distance and that all the > wounded had been recovered. The dead, however, had to be left where they had > fallen. Meanwhile, on the southern slope of the objective, the wounded from > No. 6 Platoon were being evacuated while the rest remained under cover of > the rocks.Peter Harclerode, PARA!: Fifty Years of The Parachute Regiment, p. > 354, Arms & Armour Press, 1993 The British 3rd Commando Brigade commander, Brigadier Julian Thompson was reported as having said: > \\"I was on the point of withdrawing my Paras from Mount Longdon. We couldn't > believe that these teenagers disguised as soldiers were causing us to suffer > many casualties.\\" Jon Cooksey, 3 PARA Mount Longdon: The Bloodiest Battle, > p. 98, Pen & Sword Books Ltd By the time the 21 survivors of Castañeda's 46-man platoon had worked their way off the mountain, they were utterly exhausted. One of them, Private Leonardo Rondi, was wearing a maroon beret – taken from a dead Parachute Regiment soldier. Private Rondi, having dodged groups of Paras to deliver messages to Castañeda's section leaders, had found the body of a Para behind a rock (it may have been Sergeant McKay) and took his red beret and SLR which he later gave to the Argentine commanders as trophies.Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.176, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 Rondi was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal. British resume the attack Following the unexpectedly fierce fighting on 'Fly Half', Maj. Argue pulled back Nos. 4, and 5 Platoons and 29 Commando Regiment directed artillery fire at the mountain from Mount Kent, after which the area was flanked from the left. Under heavy fire, the remnants of 4 and 5 Platoons, under Lieutenant Mark Cox, advanced upon their objective of 'Full Back', taking some casualties from Casteñeda's platoon in the form of Corporal Julio Nardielo Mamani's section as they did so. As he was clearing the Argentine position, Private Grey was injured from a headshot but refused to be evacuated until Maj. Argue had consolidated his troops properly in their positions on 'Fly Half'. Private Kevin Connery dispatched three wounded Argentines in this action. The Paras could not move any further without taking unacceptable losses and so were pulled back to the western end of Mount Longdon, with the orders for Major David Collett's A Company to move through B Company and assault, from the west, the eastern objective of 'Full Back', a heavily defended position, with covering fire being given from Support Company. Lieutenant David Wright and Second Lieutenant Ian Moore mustered their platoons near the western summit and had briefed them on how to deal with the enemy. They then attacked the position, clearing it of its Argentine garrison with rifle, grenade and bayonet in close quarters combat. As A Company was clearing the final positions, Corporal McLaughlin was injured by a Czekalski recoilless rifle round fired from Wireless Ridge (reportedly the anti-tank gun operated by Corporals Julio César Canteros and Jorge Norberto González from the 7th Regiment Recce Platoon on nearby 'Rough Diamond') and was subsequently killed by an 81mm round fired from First Sergeant Mario Ricardo Alcaide's Mortar Platoon also on 'Rough Diamond' as he was making his way to the aid post. The Argentines rigorously defended 'Full Back'. Although already wounded, Corporal Manuel Medina of Castañeda's platoon took over another recoilless rifle detachment and fired along the ridge at Support Company, killing three Paras,Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.177, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 including Private Peter Heddicker, who took the full force of a 105 mm anti-tank round, and wounded three others. Major Carrizo- Salvadores abandoned his command bunker on 'Full Back' when a MILAN missile detonated against rocks just behind him.Malvinas: Relatos de Soldados, Martín Antonio Balza, p.83, Círculo Militar, 1986 In the command bunker Major Collett found 2,000 cigarettes, which he gave to the smokers in his company. Swearing in English\\"The reservists in Castaneda's platoon all knew each other well. Having been conscripted from Lanus and Bandfield, Buenos Aires, many of the conscripts indulged a taste for Hollywood movies and American swearing. This 46-man platoon came in at the critical moment and showed themselves to be willing to fight at close quarters. The platoon fought bitterly on the northern sector of Mount Longdon and not altogether without success. Castaneda's men made attacks on the advancing British Paratroopers, compelling them to eventually withdraw after 2 hours of brutal boulder-to-boulder fighting\\". Mount Longdon: The Argentinian Story and the discovery of several dead Argentine Marines dressed in camouflaged uniforms at first led the Paras to believe they had encountered mercenaries from the United States. ==Aftermath== National Memorial Arboretum, plaque to Jason, Neil & Ian The battle lasted twelve hours and had been costly to both sides. 3 PARA lost seventeen killed during the battle; one Royal Engineer attached to 3 PARA also died. Two of the 3 PARA dead – Privates Ian Scrivens and Jason Burt – were only seventeen years old, and Private Neil Grose was killed on his 18th birthday. Forty British paratroopers were wounded. A further four Paras and one REME craftsman were killed and seven Paratroopers were wounded in the following two-day shelling that followed, that was directed by Sub-Lieutenant Marcelo de Marco of the 5th Marines on Tumbledown Mountain. Several Paras were also wounded by the counter-fire directed by the Argentine Forward Artillery Observation Officer (Major Guillermo Nani) on Wireless Ridge on the night of 13–14 June.\\"There is half an hour between dawn and the arrival of the first casualties, mainly Scots Guards from Tumbledown. Fitzroy are saturated, and Teal Inlet busy with 3 Para casualties from an all-night stonking of Mount Longdon by enemy artillery. Red and Green Life Machine, Rick Jolly, p. 127, Transworld Publishers Limited, 1984 Another eight Paras had been wounded in an earlier Friendly fire incident.\\"The location of the patrol from A Company was somehow sent by battalion HQ on a different radio net to C Company as an enemy grid reference. The C Company patrol commander plotted this enemy position on his map and realised he could see soldiers there—some fifteen hundred metres away, too far to recognise who they were. Using great skill, he was able to bring down artillery and machine-gun fire onto the A Company patrol, chasing them down into a re-entrant, wounding most of them, two with serious head- wounds. Forgotten Voices of the Falklands, Hugh McManners, p. 334, Random House, 2008A Royal Marine Commando Sapper (Sergeant Peter Thorpe) was also wounded on the western lower slopes of Mount Longdon in the daylight hours of 12 June, when he was sent forward to assist members of an artillery battery trapped inside a disabled Snowcat tracked vehicle that had run into a minefield.The other companies had skirted one minefield on their approach and Staff Sergeant Pete Thorpe of Condor Troop Royal Engineers was later to lose his foot on a mine while trying to extract a damaged vehicle with injured gunners, near Murrell Bridge.

The high-energy electrical arc slowly erodes the glass, leaving a frosted appearance. Ablation is removal or destruction of material from an object by vaporization, chipping, or other erosive processes. Examples of ablative materials are described below, and include spacecraft material for ascent and atmospheric reentry, ice and snow in glaciology, biological tissues in medicine and passive fire protection materials. ==Artificial intelligence== In artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning, ablation is the removal of a component of an AI system. The term is by analogy with biology: removal of components of an organism. ==Biology== Biological ablation is the removal of a biological structure or functionality. Genetic ablation is another term for gene silencing, in which gene expression is abolished through the alteration or deletion of genetic sequence information. In cell ablation, individual cells in a population or culture are destroyed or removed. Both can be used as experimental tools, as in loss-of-function experiments.Cell Ablation definition, Change Bioscience. == Electro-Ablation == Electro-ablation, is an electrochemical process similar to electro-polishing, that removes material from a metallic workpiece to reduce surface roughness. It is similar to electro-polishing in that it uses a current flowing through an electrolyte from the workpiece (Anode) to remove metal from the surface of the workpiece, producing a smoother surface. It differs from electro-polishing in its current flow, frequency and high rate of metal removal (ablation). Electro-polishing uses low currents, usually much less than 1 Amp/cm2, that are usually constant or changing at very low frequency. This limits the speed of electro-polishing. Components often requiring several hours of immersed electro-polishing for significant reduction in surface roughness. This reduces the attractiveness of electro-polishing for post-processing of metallic components, such as those produced by Metal Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing of Metals). Electro- ablation uses a combination of very high current flow (usually in excess of 10 Amps/cm2) combined with very high frequency (up to 200kHz) changes in current flow. This allows electro-ablation to break through highly resistive oxide surfaces, such as those found on Titanium and other exotic metals and alloys. Through software control, electro-ablation processes are able to quickly remove - via ablation - tough protective oxide layers and then immediately reduce the current flow to avoid melting the underlying non-oxidised metal or alloy. This allows very quick surface finishing. The process is capable of providing surface finishing for a wide range of exotic and widely used metals and alloys, including: Titanium, Stainless Steel, Niobium, Chromium-Cobalt, Inconel, Aluminium and a range of widely available steels and alloys. Due to its use of very high frequencies, electro-ablation is very effective at achieving high levels of surface finishing in holes, valleys and hidden or internal surfaces on metallic workpieces (parts). The process is particularly applicable to components produced by Additive Manufacturing process, such as 3D-printed metals. These components tend to be produced with roughness levels well above 5-20 micron. Electro-ablation can be used to quickly reduce the surface roughness to less than 0.8 micron, allowing the post-process to be used for volume production surface finishing. The electro-ablation process can be applied in two ways, “Brush” or “Immersion” in a bath. The brush method occurs in air, above a drain tank, with the electrolyte and cathode contained in a brush, that is either handheld or positioned by robotic control. This method is preferred for objects that only require surface finishing on limited areas or on objects that are too large to be used in an Immersion tank. The Immersion method requires the object to be immersed in a tank containing an electrolyte, usually phosphoric acid, and cathodic probes. This method is preferred for objects produced in a high-volume production environment, where low-skilled labour is available for loading and unloading components, or where longer surface finishing times are required. ==Glaciology== In glaciology and meteorology, ablation—the opposite of accumulation—refers to all processes that remove snow, ice, or water from a glacier or snowfield.Paterson, W. S. B. 1999. The Physics of Glaciers. Tarrytown, N.Y., Pergamon. Ablation refers to the melting of snow or ice that runs off the glacier, evaporation, sublimation, calving, or erosive removal of snow by wind. Air temperature is typically the dominant control of ablation, with precipitation exercising secondary control. In a temperate climate during ablation season, ablation rates typically average around 2 mm/h. Where solar radiation is the dominant cause of snow ablation (e.g., if air temperatures are low under clear skies), characteristic ablation textures such as suncups and penitentes may develop on the snow surface. Ablation can refer either to the processes removing ice and snow or to the quantity of ice and snow removed. Debris-covered glaciers have also been shown to greatly impact the ablation process. There is a thin debris layer that can be located on the top of glaciers that intensifies the ablation process below the ice. The debris-covered parts of a glacier that is experiencing ablation are sectioned into three categories which include ice cliffs, ponds, and debris. These three sections allow scientists to measure the heat digested by the debris-covered area and is calculated. The calculations are dependent on the area and net absorbed heat amounts in regards to the entire debris-covered zones. These types of calculations are done to various glaciers to understand and analyze future patterns of melting.Sakai, Akiko, et al. \\"Role of supraglacial ponds in the ablation process of a debris-covered glacier in the Nepal Himalayas.\\" IAHS PUBLICATION (2000): 119-132. Moraine (glacial debris) is moved by natural processes that allow for down-slope movement of materials on the glacier body. It is noted that if the slope of a glacier is too high then the debris will continue to move along the glacier to a further location. The sizes and locations of glaciers vary around the world, so depending on the climate and physical geography the varieties of debris can differ. The size and magnitude of the debris is dependent on the area of glacier and can vary from dust-size fragments to blocks as large as a house. There has been many experiments done to demonstrate the effect of debris on the surface of glaciers. Yoshiyuki Fujii, a professor at the National Institute of Polar Research designed an experiment that showed ablation rate was accelerated under a thin debris layer and was retarded under a thick one as compared with that of a natural snow surface. This science is significant due to the importance of long-term availability of water resources and assess glacier response to climate change.Kayastha, Rijan Bhakta, et al. \\"Practical prediction of ice melting beneath various thickness of debris cover on Khumbu Glacier, Nepal, using a positive degree-day factor.\\" IAHS PUBLICATION 7182 (2000). Natural resource availability is a major drive behind research conducted in regards to the ablation process and overall study of glaciers. ==Laser ablation== An Nd:YAG laser drills a hole through a block of nitrile. The intense burst of infrared radiation ablates the highly absorbing rubber, releasing an eruption of plasma.Laser ablation is greatly affected by the nature of the material and its ability to absorb energy, therefore the wavelength of the ablation laser should have a minimum absorption depth. While these lasers can average a low power, they can offer peak intensity and fluence given by: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Intensity } (\\\\mathrm{W}/\\\\mathrm{cm}^2) &= \\\\frac{\\\\text{average power } (\\\\mathrm{W})}{\\\\text{focal spot area } (\\\\mathrm{cm}^2)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\text{Peak intensity } (\\\\mathrm{W}/\\\\mathrm{cm}^2) &= \\\\frac{\\\\text{peak power } (\\\\mathrm{W})}{\\\\text{focal spot area } (\\\\mathrm{cm}^2)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\text{Fluence } (\\\\mathrm{J}/\\\\mathrm{cm}^2) &= \\\\frac{\\\\text{laser pulse energy } (\\\\mathrm{J})}{\\\\text{focal spot area } (\\\\mathrm{cm}^2)} \\\\end{align} while the peak power is :\\\\text{Peak power } (\\\\mathrm{W}) = \\\\frac{\\\\text{pulse energy } (\\\\mathrm{J})}{\\\\text{pulse duration } (\\\\mathrm{s})} Surface ablation of the cornea for several types of eye refractive surgery is now common, using an excimer laser system (LASIK and LASEK). Since the cornea does not grow back, laser is used to remodel the cornea refractive properties to correct refraction errors, such as astigmatism, myopia, and hyperopia. Laser ablation is also used to remove part of the uterine wall in women with menstruation and adenomyosis problems in a process called endometrial ablation. Recently, researchers have demonstrated a successful technique for ablating subsurface tumors with minimal thermal damage to surrounding healthy tissue, by using a focused laser beam from an ultra-short pulse diode laser source. ==Marine surface coatings== Antifouling paints and other related coatings are routinely used to prevent the buildup of microorganisms and other animals, such as barnacles for the bottom hull surfaces of recreational, commercial and military sea vessels. Ablative paints are often utilized for this purpose to prevent the dilution or deactivation of the antifouling agent. Over time, the paint will slowly decompose in the water, exposing fresh antifouling compounds on the surface. Engineering the antifouling agents and the ablation rate can produce long-lived protection from the deleterious effects of biofouling. ==Medicine== In medicine, ablation is the same as removal of a part of biological tissue, usually by surgery. Surface ablation of the skin (dermabrasion, also called resurfacing because it induces regeneration) can be carried out by chemicals (chemoablation), by lasers (laser ablation), by freezing (cryoablation), or by electricity (fulguration). Its purpose is to remove skin spots, aged skin, wrinkles, thus rejuvenating it. Surface ablation is also employed in otolaryngology for several kinds of surgery, such as for snoring. Ablation therapy using radio frequency waves on the heart is used to cure a variety of cardiac arrhythmiae such as supraventricular tachycardia, Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (WPW), ventricular tachycardia, and more recently as management of atrial fibrillation. The term is often used in the context of laser ablation, a process in which a laser dissolves a material's molecular bonds. For a laser to ablate tissues, the power density or fluence must be high, otherwise thermocoagulation occurs, which is simply thermal vaporization of the tissues. Rotoablation is a type of arterial cleansing that consists of inserting a tiny, diamond-tipped, drill-like device into the affected artery to remove fatty deposits or plaque. The procedure is used in the treatment of coronary heart disease to restore blood flow. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a method of removing aberrant tissue from within the body via minimally invasive procedures. Microwave ablation (MWA) is similar to RFA but at higher frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation removes tissue from within the body noninvasively. Bone marrow ablation is a process whereby the human bone marrow cells are eliminated in preparation for a bone marrow transplant. This is performed using high-intensity chemotherapy and total body irradiation. As such, it has nothing to do with the vaporization techniques described in the rest of this article. Ablation of brain tissue is used for treating certain neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease, and sometimes for psychiatric disorders as well. Recently, some researchers reported successful results with genetic ablation. In particular, genetic ablation is potentially a much more efficient method of removing unwanted cells, such as tumor cells, because large numbers of animals lacking specific cells could be generated. Genetically ablated lines can be maintained for a prolonged period of time and shared within the research community. Researchers at Columbia University report of reconstituted caspases combined from C. elegans and humans, which maintain a high degree of target specificity. The genetic ablation techniques described could prove useful in battling cancer. ==Passive fire protection== Firestopping and fireproofing products can be ablative in nature. This can mean endothermic materials, or merely materials that are sacrificial and become \\"spent\\" over time while exposed to fire, such as silicone firestop products. Given sufficient time under fire or heat conditions, these products char away, crumble, and disappear. The idea is to put enough of this material in the way of the fire that a level of fire-resistance rating can be maintained, as demonstrated in a fire test. Ablative materials usually have a large concentration of organic matter that is reduced by fire to ashes. In the case of silicone, organic rubber surrounds very finely divided silica dust (up to 380 m² of combined surface area of all the dust particles per gram of this dust). When the organic rubber is exposed to fire, it burns to ash and leaves behind the silica dust with which the product started. ==Spaceflight== In spacecraft design, ablation is used to both cool and protect mechanical parts and/or payloads that would otherwise be damaged by extremely high temperatures. Two principal applications are heat shields for spacecraft entering a planetary atmosphere from space and cooling of rocket engine nozzles. Examples include the Apollo Command Module that protected astronauts from the heat of atmospheric reentry and the Kestrel second stage rocket engine designed for exclusive use in an environment of space vacuum since no heat convection is possible. In a basic sense, ablative material is designed so that instead of heat being transmitted into the structure of the spacecraft, only the outer surface of the material bears the majority of the heating effect. The outer surface chars and burns away -- but quite slowly, only gradually exposing new fresh protective material beneath. The heat is carried away from the spacecraft by the gases generated by the ablative process, and never penetrates the surface material, so the metallic and other sensitive structures they protect, remain at a safe temperature. As the surface burns and disperses into space, while the remaining solid material continues to insulate the craft from ongoing heat and superheated gases. The thickness of the ablative layer is calculated to be sufficient to survive the heat it will encounter on its mission. There is an entire branch of spaceflight research involving the search for new fireproofing materials to achieve the best ablative performance; this function is critical to protect the spacecraft occupants and payload from otherwise excessive heat loading.Parker, John and C. Michael Hogan, \\"Techniques for Wind Tunnel assessment of Ablative Materials\\", NASA Ames Research Center, Technical Publication, August 1965. The same technology is used in some passive fire protection applications, in some cases by the same vendors, who offer different versions of these fireproofing products, some for aerospace and some for structural fire protection. ==See also== * electrical Arc flash burns * Ablative armor ==References== ==External links== *Chemical Peeling.

Its southernmost cusp is the Oppius (Oppian Hill). A handbook of Rome and the Campagna (1899) (14762604401) ==Etymology== The origin of the name Esquiline is still under much debate. One view is that the hill was named after the abundance of (Italian oaks) growing there. Another view is that, during Rome's infancy, the Capitolium, the Palatinum, and the northern fringes of the Caelian were the most-populated areas of the city, whose inhabitants were considered (\\"in- towners\\"); those who inhabited the external regions – Aurelian, Oppius, Cispius, Fagutal – were considered (\\"suburbanites\\"). ==History== The Esquiline Hill includes three prominent spurs, which are sometimes called \\"hills\\" as well:Amanda Claridge: Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide, Oxford University Press, 2010, page 5 *Cispian (Cispius) - northern spur *Oppian (Oppius) - southern spur *Fagutal (Fagutalis) - western spur Rising above the valley in which was later built the Colosseum, the Esquiline was a fashionable residential district. According to Livy, the settlement on the Esquiline was expanded during the reign of Servius Tullius, Rome's sixth king, in the 6th century BC. The king also moved his residence to the hill in order to increase its respectability.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.44 The political advisor and art patron Maecenas (70–8 BC) sited his gardens, the first in the Hellenistic- Persian garden style in Rome, on the Esquiline Hill, atop the Servian Wall and its adjoining necropolis. It contained terraces, libraries and other aspects of Roman culture. At the Oppius, Nero (37 AD–68 AD) confiscated property to build his extravagant, mile-long Golden House, and later still Trajan (53–117) constructed his bath complex, both of whose remains are visible today. The 3rd-century Horti Liciniani, a group of gardens (including the relatively well-preserved nymphaeum formerly identified as the non-extant Temple of Minerva Medica), were probably constructed on the Esquiline Hill. Farther to the northeast, at the summit of the Cispius, is the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. In 1781, the first known copy of the marble statue of a discus thrower – the Discobolus of Myron – was discovered on the Roman property of the Massimo family, the Villa Palombara, on the Esquiline Hill. The famous Esquiline Treasure, now in the British Museum, was found on the Esquiline Hill. ==Namesakes== *The tiny hamlet of El Esquilinchuche in Honduras is named after the Esquiline Hill. == See also == * Janiculum Hill * Monte Mario * Pincian Hill * Vatican Hill * Velian Hill == References == Category:Seven hills of Rome Category:Rome R. XV Esquilino ","title":"Esquiline Hill"},{"id":"529958","text":"The Caelian Hill (; ; ) is one of the famous seven hills of Rome. == Geography == The Caelian Hill seen from the Aventine Hill. The Caelian Hill is a sort of long promontory about long, to wide, and tall in the park near the Temple of Claudius. The hill overlooks a plateau from which the Esquiline, Viminal and Quirinal hills also arise. Caeliolus (also Caeliculus or Caelius Minor) corresponds to a section of the hill, maybe the westernmost one, towards the valley that houses the Colosseum, or the one now occupied by the Basilica dei Santi Quattro Coronati. ==History Archaic age === Schematic map of Rome showing the seven hills and Servian wall. Under the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the entire population of Alba Longa was forcibly resettled on the Caelian Hill. According to a tradition recounted by Livy, the hill received its name from the Etruscan folk hero Caelius Vibenna, because he either settled there or was honored posthumously by his friend Servius Tullius. Other authors have linked the name to the Latin caelum, \\"heaven\\". Nevertheless, the former name of the hill probably was Querquetulanus mons due to the abundance of oaks (Latin: Quercus). Scholarship suggests that there existed the ethnic name Querquetulani as a designation of the previous inhabitants of Caelius, in pre- Etruscan times.Loicq, Jean. \\"Sur les peuples de nom «vénète» ou assimilé dans l’Occident européen\\". In: Etudes Celtiques, vol. 35, 2003. p. 146. DOI: 10.3406/ecelt.2003.2153. Mons Caelius would have been included in the city perimeter under the reign of Ancus Marcius.Strabo, Geographica, V, 3,7. The list of Septimontium mentions it, and it was part of the 1st city quarter (Suburana) in the division made by Servius Tullius. In the later Augustan division, it became the Regio II Caelimontium. A trace of the archaic period remains in the memory of cults of woods and sources, such as that of the nymph Egeria in the wood of Camenae, just outside Porta Capena. Numa Pompilius is said to have been particularly devoted to his sanctuary. === Republican age === In Republican age (as well in Imperial Rome) the Caelian Hill was a fashionable residential district and the site of residences of the wealthy. A section of Pliny the Elder's Natural History, \\"Who Was the First to Encrust the Walls of Houses at Rome with Marble\\", attests to this. Mamurra, a soldier who served under Julius Caesar in Gaul and profited tremendously from corruption, achieved this expensive feat on the Caelian Hill; Horace and Catullus mocked him accordingly. Most of the hill was outside the boundaries of the pomerium, therefore temples to foreign divinities were allowed to be built, such as the Temple of Minerva Capta or the old Sacellum of Diana, outside the Servian Wall. Some sepulchres, such as the burial chamber in Via Celimontana, just before Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano, date back to this period. === Imperial age === This basanite statue of Agrippina the Younger as a priestess of the divine Claudius, 54–59 AD, was discovered on the Caelian Hill in 1885. Under Augustus the Caelian Hill was one of the 14 divisions of the town, called Caelimontium. The area between the Lateran and Porta Maggiore was included in the v Regio (Esquiliae), though physically it is part of the hill. On the higher point of the side facing the Colosseum, the Temple of Claudius was erected on a huge supporting platform. It was dedicated to the Emperor Claudius and begun by his widow Agrippina after his death and deification in 54 AD; it was not ultimately finished until the reign of Vespasian. Nero added a grand nymphaeum (tiered water fountain) to the eastern retaining wall of this platform, with semi-circular and rectangular niches. The water to supply this fountain was supplied by a special branch of the Aqua Claudia, called the Arcus Neroniani, which extended 2 kilometres west from the Claudia at Porta Maggiore and terminated on the southern side of the Caelian Hill in a structure called the Aqueductium. The Aqueductium distributed the water via conduits to reservoirs behind the nymphaeum and to the site of the temple. The remains found in the area of the hill allow one to reconstruct a conspicuous housing phase in the second half of the 2nd century AD, while former buildings of the 1st century BC were probably destroyed by a fire in AD 27. Jerome alleges that Marcus Aurelius was born on the Caelian Hill in AD 121. In the 4th century rich domus, surrounded by vast parks, stood on the hill, such as the ones belonging to the Symmachi (near which rose the Basilica hilariana) and Tetrici families, as well as the domus Faustae, maybe belonged to the wife of Constantine I. The property of the Annii, of Domitia Lucilla Minor (the mother of Marcus Aurelius) and of the Quintilii became part of the Domus Vectiliana of Commodus. In the interurban area of the hill several barracks were built for the troops stationed in the capital: in the site of the Basilica of Saint Stephen in the Round there were the Castra Peregrina (built under Trajan and restored several times in the following centuries), close to a large house of the Valerii (domus Valerii). Opposite, stood the headquarters of the V Cohort of the Vigiles (stazio cohortis V vigilum). In a land possession of the Laterani family Septimius Severus built between 193 and 197 the castra nova equitum singularium, a new barrack for the knights corps of the imperial guard, opposite the former barrack built under Trajan (castra priora equitum singularium). When Constantine I dissolved the corps, the new basilica dedicated to the Messiah, which later became the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, partially occupied the area of the Severian camp. The buildings of the Caelian hill were badly damaged during the sack of Alaric in 410; starting from this period, the hill was subject to increasing abandonment and ruralization. === Middle Ages === In the 6th century it was part of the II Roman ecclesiastical region due to its proximity to the Lateran basilica, so much so that the toponym of \\"Laterano\\" was often used for the entire hill. The erection of the Patriarchium, probably still in 6th Century, gave rise to the creation of various tituli (the oldest places of Christian worship, often within private houses) and xenodochia (centers for the assistance and reception of pilgrims and sick). New churches continued to be built, initially to replace and above the former tituli, later independently, such as the Basilica of Saints John and Paul, the Basilica of the Four Crowned Martyrs, the Basilica of St. Mary in Domnica, the Basilica of St. Stephen in the Round, the church of San Giovanni a Porta Latina, the church of San Gregorio al Celio, the church of San Tommaso in Formis, the church of San Sisto Vecchio Monasteries, often surrounded by estates and gardens, were also founded on the hill, as well as some towers of noble families, mainly in the 10th and 11th centuries. A new destruction was suffered with the sack of 1084. Since the 12th century, it was part of the Regio Montium, which even extended to the Quirinal Hill. ===Later history=== Today the Caelian Hill is included in the Rione of the same name and, continuing its vocation for assistance, hosts the Policlinico Militare del Celio, built on a project by Salvatore Bianchi and Filippo Laccetti. George Santayana lived in a room at the Convent of English blue sisters on the Caelian Hill from 1912 until his death. == Monuments == * Temple of Claudius * Basilica dei Santi Quattro Coronati * Clivus Scauri * Library of Pope Agapetus I * Basilica dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo * Sant'Andrea al Celio * Church of San Gregorio al Celio * Basilica di Santa Maria in Domnica * Arch of Dolabella * Villa Celimontana * Obelisk of villa Celimontana * Church of San Tommaso in Formis * Porta Metronia * Porta Latina * Church of San Giovanni a Porta Latina * Oratory of San Giovanni in Oleo * Tomb of the Scipios * Basilica of San Sisto Vecchio * Basilica di Santo Stefano Rotondo al Monte Celio == See also == == References == == Bibliography == * Filippo Coarelli, Guida archeologica di Roma, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Verona 1984. * Caelius I Santa Maria in Domnica San Tommaso in Formis e il clivus Scauri, edited by A.

When a company is unaware of what software is installed and being used on its machines, it can result in multiple layers of exposure. The primary benefits a corporation receives from performing a software licensing audit are greater control and various forms of cost savings. The audit is used both as an efficiency mechanism to improve software distribution within an organisation and as a preventative mechanism to avoid copyright infringement prosecution by software companies. Software licensing audits are an important part of software asset management, but also serve as a method of corporate reputation management by ensuring that the company is operating within legal and ethical guidelines. Software audits should not be confused with code audits, which are carried out on the source code of a software project. == Challenges == If the auditing company self-dependently scans the code base, one of the serious challenges is the license changes between versions. Some software libraries start with one license and later switch into another. The typical examples are switching from the single permissive license to the dual licensing model (the choice between strong reciprocal or paid commercial) as for iText, switching from more reciprocal to more permissive license (as for Qt Extended) and opensourcing the previously commercial code (as for OpenJDK). In such cases it is not enough to detect that some library or code fragment has been used - an exact used version must be correctly identified. Further difficulties may arise if the library owner removes the obsolete versions (that were under different license) from the public sources. Some licenses (like LGPL) have very different conditions for the simple linking and creating of the derivative works. In such case the proper audit must take into consideration if the library has been linked or the derivative work (custom branch) has been created. Finally, some software packages may internally contain fragments of the source code (such as source code of the Oracle Java) that may be provided only for reference or have various other licenses, not necessary compatible with the internal policies of the company. If the software team actually does not use (or even is not aware) about such fragments, this must be viewed differently from the case if they would be directly linked. All these issues are relatively easy to resolve if the auditing group cooperates with the software team that normally should know the used versions and so on. If the software team is not trusted, an incompetent audit may find many \\"inconsistencies\\" and \\"violations\\" where there are not any. ==Software asset management== Software asset management is an organisation process, which is outlined in ISO/IEC 19770-1. It is also now embraced within ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Management Systems - Requirements and ISO/IEC 17799:2005 Information Technology - Security Techniques - Code of Practice for Information Security Management. Software asset management is a comprehensive strategy that has to be addressed from top to bottom in an organisation to be effective, to minimize risk. A software compliance audit is an important sub-set of software asset management and is covered in the above referenced standards. At its simplest it involves the following: # Identification of Software Assets. # Verifying the Software Assets including licenses, usage, and rights. # Identifying gaps that may exist between what exists on the installations, and the licenses possessed, and the rights of usage. # Taking action to close any gaps. # Recording the results in a centralised location with Proof Of Purchase records. The audit process itself should be a continuing action, and modern SAM software identifies what is installed, where it is installed, its usage, and provides a reconciliation of this discovery against usage. This is a very useful means of controlling software installations and lowering the costs of licensing. Large organisations could not do this without discovery and inventory applications. From time to time internal or external (by major accounting firms) audits may take a forensic approach to establish what is installed on the computers in an organisation with the purpose of ensuring that it is all legal and authorised and to ensure that its process of processing transactions or events is correct. Though one might be confronted with a software vendor audit by fair contractual and legal means, one should know and reserve one's crucial rights in an audit situation as well. Software audits are a component of corporate risk management, and they certainly minimise the risk of prosecution for copyright infringement due to use of unlicensed software. Most vendors permit the company to settle without prosecution though in serious cases, prosecutions certainly occur. In addition with a strict software usage policy the risk of computer viruses are minimised by preventing uncontrolled software copying. ==Organizations== Vendors subscribe to organizations such as the Federation Against Software Theft (FAST) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA) as a means of providing an industry approach to control piracy, counterfeiting, and illegal use of software. They publicize campaigns against illegal use of software and reward any employees who notify them of any breaches which result in successful prosecution and/or recovery of license fees. == See also == * License manager * Business Software Alliance * Software and Information Industry Association * International Organization for Standardization * Australian Software Asset Management Association (ASAMA) == References == Category:Types of auditing Audit ","title":"Software licensing audit"},{"id":"529981","text":"A membrane transport protein (or simply transporter) is a membrane protein involved in the movement of ions, small molecules, and macromolecules, such as another protein, across a biological membrane. Transport proteins are integral transmembrane protein; that is they exist permanently within and span the membrane across which they transport substances. The proteins may assist in the movement of substances by facilitated diffusion or active transport. The two main types of proteins involved in such transport are broadly categorized as either channels or carriers. The solute carriers and atypical SLCs are secondary active or facilitative transporters in humans. Collectively membrane transporters and channels are transportome. Transportomes govern cellular influx and efflux of not only ions and nutrients but drugs as well. ==Difference between channels and carriers== A carrier is not open simultaneously to both the extracellular and intracellular environments. Either its inner gate is open, or outer gate is open. In contrast, a channel can be open to both environments at the same time, allowing the molecules to diffuse without interruption. Carriers have binding sites, but pores and channels do not.Sadava, David, et al. Life, the Science of Biology, 9th Edition. Macmillan Publishers, 2009. . p. 119.Thompson, Liz A. Passing the North Carolina End of Course Test for Biology. American Book Company, Inc. 2007. . p. 97. When a channel is opened, millions of ions can pass through the membrane per second, but only 100 to 1000 molecules typically pass through a carrier molecule in the same time. Each carrier protein is designed to recognize only one substance or one group of very similar substances. Research has correlated defects in specific carrier proteins with specific diseases.Sadava, David, Et al. Life, the Science of Biology, 9th Edition. Macmillan Publishers, 2009. . p. 119. ==Active transport== The action of the sodium-potassium pump is an example of primary active transport. The two carrier proteins on the left are using ATP to move sodium out of the cell against the concentration gradient. The proteins on the right are using secondary active transport to move potassium into the cell. Active transport is the movement of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient. This is usually to accumulate high concentrations of molecules that a cell needs, such as glucose or amino acids. If the process uses chemical energy, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is called primary active transport. Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient, and does not use energy produced in the cell.Ashley, Ruth. Hann, Gary. Han, Seong S. Cell Biology. New Age International Publishers. . p. 113. Unlike channel proteins which only transport substances through membranes passively, carrier proteins can transport ions and molecules either passively through facilitated diffusion, or via secondary active transport.Taiz, Lincoln. Zeigler, Eduardo. Plant Physiology and Development. Sinauer Associates, 2015. . pp. 151. A carrier protein is required to move particles from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration. These carrier proteins have receptors that bind to a specific molecule (substrate) needing transport. The molecule or ion to be transported (the substrate) must first bind at a binding site at the carrier molecule, with a certain binding affinity. Following binding, and while the binding site is facing the same way, the carrier will capture or occlude (take in and retain) the substrate within its molecular structure and cause an internal translocation so that the opening in the protein now faces the other side of the plasma membrane.Kent, Michael. Advanced Biology. Oxford University Press US, 2000. . pp. 157–158. The carrier protein substrate is released at that site, according to its binding affinity there. ==Facilitated diffusion== Facilitated diffusion in the cell membrane, showing ion channels (left) and carrier proteins (three on the right). Facilitated diffusion is the passage of molecules or ions across a biological membrane through specific transport proteins and requires no energy input. Facilitated diffusion is used especially in the case of large polar molecules and charged ions; once such ions are dissolved in water they cannot diffuse freely across cell membranes due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids that make up the bilayers. The type of carrier proteins used in facilitated diffusion is slightly different from those used in active transport. They are still transmembrane carrier proteins, but these are gated transmembrane channels, meaning they do not internally translocate, nor require ATP to function. The substrate is taken in one side of the gated carrier, and without using ATP the substrate is released into the cell. They may be used as potential biomarkers. ==Reverse diffusion== Reverse transport, or transporter reversal, is a phenomenon in which the substrates of a membrane transport protein are moved in the opposite direction to that of their typical movement by the transporter. Transporter reversal typically occurs when a membrane transport protein is phosphorylated by a particular protein kinase, which is an enzyme that adds a phosphate group to proteins. ==Types== (Grouped by Transporter Classification database categories) ===1: Channels/pores=== * α-helical protein channels such as voltage-gated ion channel (VIC), ligand-gated ion channels(LGICs) * β-barrel porins such as aquaporin * channel-forming toxins, including colicins, diphtheria toxin, and others * Nonribosomally synthesized channels such as gramicidin * Holins; which function in export of enzymes that digest bacterial cell walls in an early step of cell lysis. Facilitated diffusion occurs in and out of the cell membrane via channels/pores and carriers/porters. Note: * Channels: Channels are either in open state or closed state. When a channel is opened with a slight conformational switch, it is open to both environment simultaneously (extracellular and intracellular) *This picture represents symport. The yellow triangle shows the concentration gradient for the yellow circles while the green triangle shows the concentration gradient for the green circles and the purple rods are the transport protein bundle. The green circles are moving against their concentration gradient through a transport protein which requires energy while the yellow circles move down their concentration gradient which releases energy. The yellow circles produce more energy through chemiosmosis than what is required to move the green circles so the movement is coupled and some energy is cancelled out. One example is the lactose permease which allows protons to go down its concentration gradient into the cell while also pumping lactose into the cell.Pores: Pores are continuously open to these both environment, because they do not undergo conformational changes. They are always open and active. ===2: Electrochemical potential- driven transporters=== Also named carrier proteins or secondary carriers. * 2.A: Porters (uniporters, symporters, antiporters), SLCs. **The picture represents uniport. The yellow triangle shows the concentration gradient for the yellow circles and the purple rods are the transport protein bundle. Since they move down their concentration gradient through a transport protein, they can release energy as a result of chemiosmosis. One example is GLUT1 which moves glucose down its concentration gradient into the cell.Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) *** EAAT1 *** EAAT2 *** EAAT3 *** EAAT4 *** EAAT5 ** Glucose transporter ** Monoamine transporters, including: *** Dopamine transporter (DAT) *** Norepinephrine transporter (NET) *** Serotonin transporter (SERT) *** Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT) ** Adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) * 2.B: Nonribosomally synthesized porters, such as: ** The Nigericin family ** The Ionomycin family * 2.C: Ion-gradient-driven energizers ===3: Primary active transporters=== * 3.A: P-P-bond-hydrolysis- driven transporters : ** ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), such as MDR, CFTR ** V-type ATPase ; ( \\"V\\" related to vacuolar ). ** P-type ATPase ; ( \\"P\\" related to phosphorylation), such as : *** Na+/K+-ATPase *** Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase *** Proton pump **This picture represents antiport. The yellow triangle shows the concentration gradient for the yellow circles while the blue triangle shows the concentration gradient for the blue circles and the purple rods are the transport protein bundle. The blue circles are moving against their concentration gradient through a transport protein which requires energy while the yellow circles move down their concentration gradient which releases energy. The yellow circles produce more energy through chemiosmosis than what is required to move the blue circles so the movement is coupled and some energy is cancelled out. One example is the sodium-proton exchanger which allows protons to go down their concentration gradient into the cell while pumping sodium out of the cell.F-type ATPase; (\\"F\\" related to factor), including: mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase1 * 3.B: Decarboxylation-driven transporters * 3.C: Methyltransfer-driven transporters * 3.D: Oxidoreduction-driven transporters * 3.E: Light absorption-driven transporters, such as rhodopsin === 4: Group translocators === The group translocators provide a special mechanism for the phosphorylation of sugars as they are transported into bacteria (PEP group translocation) ===5: Electron carriers=== The transmembrane electron transfer carriers in the membrane include two-electron carriers, such as the disulfide bond oxidoreductases (DsbB and DsbD in E. coli) as well as one-electron carriers such as NADPH oxidase. Often these redox proteins are not considered transport proteins. ==Examples== Every carrier protein, especially within the same cell membrane, is specific to one type or family of molecules. For example, GLUT1 is a named carrier protein found in almost all animal cell membranes that transports glucose across the bilayer. Other specific carrier proteins also help the body function in important ways. Cytochromes operate in the electron transport chain as carrier proteins for electrons. ==Pathology== A number of inherited diseases involve defects in carrier proteins in a particular substance or group of cells. Cysteinuria (cysteine in the urine and the bladder) is such a disease involving defective cysteine carrier proteins in the kidney cell membranes. This transport system normally removes cysteine from the fluid destined to become urine and returns this essential amino acid to the blood. When this carrier malfunctions, large quantities of cysteine remain in the urine, where it is relatively insoluble and tends to precipitate. This is one cause of urinary stones.Sherwood, Lauralee. 7th Edition. Human Physiology. From Cells to Systems. Cengage Learning, 2008. p. 67 Some vitamin carrier proteins have been shown to be overexpressed in patients with malignant disease. For example, levels of riboflavin carrier protein (RCP) have been shown to be significantly elevated in people with breast cancer.Rao, PN, Levine, E et al.

Harris used various aliases, including Cleomili Harris and Youree Perris. ==Early life and education== Harris was born in Los Angeles on August 12, 1962, and raised in a Catholic Caribbean family. She attended an all-girls boarding school. ==Career== In 1996, Harris and her partner opened a theatrical production company in Seattle, Washington, which produced several plays written by her. She also acted in her first project, an autobiographical play entitled For Women Only. Her last project, Supper Club Cafe in 1997, was not successful, and she \\"left town with a trail of debts and broken promises\\" according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Some of the cast of her productions claimed that they were never paid, and that Harris \\"told her cast members she had bone cancer\\" and \\"her medical costs would prevent her from paying people immediately\\", but she wrote each actor and crew member a letter telling him or her how much money she owed them. ===Psychic Readers Network=== In the late 1990s, Harris began to work for the Psychic Readers Network under the name Cleo. She appeared as a television infomercial psychic in which she claimed she was a mystical shaman from Jamaica. Her employers' website also stated that Harris had been born in Trelawny, Jamaica, and grown up there. The Psychic Readers Network is said to have coined the title \\"Miss Cleo\\" and sent unsolicited emails, some of which stated, \\"[Miss Cleo has] been authorized to issue you a Special Tarot Reading!... it is vital that you call immediately!\\" Charges of deceptive advertising and of fraud on the part of the Psychic Readers Network began to surface around this time. Among the complaints were allegations that calls to Miss Cleo were answered by her \\"associates\\" who were actors reading from scripts, and that calls promoted as \\"free\\" were in fact charged for. In 2001, Access Resource Services doing business as Psychic Readers Network was sued in various lawsuits brought by (among others) Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, and the Federal Communications Commission, although a later report from Consumer Affairs said that \\"many customers were satisfied with the service.\\" The report did not cite its source. In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission charged the company's owners and Harris' promoters, Steven Feder and Peter Stotz, with deceptive advertising, billing, and collection practices; Harris was not indicted. The Psychic Readers Network had billed its victims for an estimated $1 billion. Her promoters agreed to settle by erasing $500 million of debt owed by its victims to Psychic Readers Network and paying a $5 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission. It emerged during a lawsuit in Florida that Harris had been born in Los Angeles, and that her parents were US citizens. ===Subsequent career=== Harris voiced the character Auntie Poulet in the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. A book, Keepin' It Real: A Practical Guide for Spiritual Living, was published and attributed authorship to Miss Cleo. In 2003, the New York Daily News reported that TV music network Fuse had signed Harris as a spokeswoman. In early 2005, Harris was reportedly appearing on television as Miss Cleo in advertisements for a used car dealership in Florida, according to the Broward- Palm Beach New Times. In 2014, using the name Cleomili Harris, she spoke about her experiences at the Psychic Readers Network in the documentary Hotline, which focused on telephone relationships between strangers. In 2015, Harris appeared as Miss Cleo in a series of advertisements for the General Mills cereal French Toast Crunch. The Psychic Readers Network intervened, however, saying that it owned the character of Miss Cleo, and the advertisements were no longer aired. ==Personal life and death== She married at age 19, gave birth to a daughter, and divorced at age 21. She had a second daughter while in her late 20s. In 2006, she came out as a lesbian. Harris developed colon cancer, which eventually spread. She died following a long illness on July 26, 2016, at age 53. ==See also== ==References== == External links == * Category:1962 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Advertising characters Category:American psychics Category:Deaths from cancer in Florida Category:Deaths from colorectal cancer Category:Lesbian entertainers Category:LGBT people from California Category:Tarot readers Category:Writers from Los Angeles ","title":"Miss Cleo"},{"id":"529995","text":"Nicholas Vivian Haward MallettA Statistical History of Springbok Rugby: Players, Tours, and Matches, Teddy Shnaps, South African Rugby Board, 1989, p. 146The Complete Book of Springbok Rugby Records, Kobus Smit, Don Nelson, 2007, p. 103 (born 30 October 1956) is a former South African rugby union player who played for the Springboks, South Africa's national rugby union team, in 1984. He also coached the Springboks between 1997 and 2000 and was the head coach of Italy's rugby union team between 2007 and 2011.L'Italia a un oxfordianoMallet nuovo c.t. azzurro – Gazzetta dello Sport ==Early life== Born on 30 October 1956 in Hertford Heath, England, Mallett moved to Rhodesia with his family in 1956 when he was only six weeks old, and his father, Tony Mallett, took up a post as an English teacher at the recently founded Peterhouse Boys' School, in Marandellas near Salisbury. Nick first arrived in Cape Town, South Africa in 1963, when his father was appointed Headmaster of Diocesan College, after which he attended St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown. He graduated from the University of Cape Town in 1977 with a BA in English and History. While a student at the university, he was selected to play for the Western Province rugby union team. ==Playing career== In 1979 Mallett moved back to England to attend University College at the University of Oxford, where he not only gained further qualifications but also won Blues in rugby union and cricket, famously hitting three sixes in one over off Ian Botham. Eventually he returned to South Africa, where he represented Western Province in four consecutive Currie Cup wins between 1982 and 1985, and played two games for the Springboks in 1984 against the South American Jaguars. === Test history === { class=\\" UNsortable\\" - !

Between 1995 and 1996, Mallett took up the role of head coach of the Boland Cavaliers before being appointed assistant coach to the Springboks in 1996 and finally getting the job of Springbok Coach in 1997. ===Coach of Springboks (1997–2000)=== Between August 1997 and December 1998, under Mallett's guidance, the Springboks went on a record winning streak of 17 consecutive test wins. As part of the unbeaten run the Springboks won the Tri Nations Series undefeated and beat several teams by record margins, including a 52–10 against France in Paris, a 68–10 win over Scotland in Edinburgh, a 33–0 defeat of Ireland and a 96–13 against Wales. The run ended when the Springbok team was defeated by England at Twickenham at the end of a long tour on 5 December 1998. The relationship between Mallet and Gary Teichmann, one of South Africa's most successful team captains ever (with 36 wins), began to sour and Teichman was controversially excluded from the 1999 Rugby World Cup squad. Mallet looked for a new captain, first turning to Corné Krige then Rassie Erasmus, Joost van der Westhuizen and André Vos for a solution. In the end, despite the internal instability in the squad, the Springboks managed four consecutive wins and were finally knocked out of the championship in the semi-final by eventual winners Australia. Despite his team's relatively mediocre results of 8 wins and 5 losses in 1999, the Springboks still managed to break more records, beating Italy 101–0 and England in the quarter-final 44–21, with Jannie de Beer kicking a world-record five drop goals in that game. In 2000, Mallett accused the South Africa Rugby Football Union (SARFU) of \\"greed\\" for selling Tri-Nations championship tickets at inflated prices. He had alienated the SARFU executive, and on 27 September he resigned as national coach at the start of a disciplinary hearing began into allegations that his comments had brought the game into disrepute. Some fans, upset by how he had treated Teichman and his team's sudden poor performance, were also keen to see him go. In spite of his team's relatively poor performance and the internal strife that marred his final years as coach, Mallett remains one of South Africa's most successful coaches ever, having won 27 of the 38 tests played under his guidance and rewriting the record books several times ===Stade Français (2002–04)=== Mallett moved back to France as coach for the Paris club Stade Français, which he led to two consecutive French domestic title wins in 2003 and 2004 before returning to South Africa where he accepted the job of Director of Rugby at Western Province. Initially there was speculation that he might coach the Springbok team again, but those rumours were quashed by the appointment of Jake White as the new South African coach. Mallet was linked with the position of England coach after the coerced resignation of Andy Robinson in 2006, a position that eventually went to Brian Ashton.Ashton given 'long-term' contract In 2007 Mallett became coach of Italy. ===Italy (2007–11)=== On 3 October 2007, Mallett replaced Frenchman Pierre Berbizier as \\"CT\\" (\\"Technical Commissioner\\", i.e. coach) of the Italy national rugby union team. His Six Nations debut was fairly impressive; Italy were defeated by Ireland 11–16 in the first game, but came close to victory against Jonny Wilkinson's England team. Italy lost also against Wales and France. In those matches he gave Andrea Marcato and Alberto Sgarbi their debuts'. In the final game, Mallett's team beat Scotland 23–20, thanks to Marcato's late drop goal. However, Italy won the wooden spoon because their points difference was worse than Scotland's. During the summer test matches, he got a good result against South Africa, the world champions at the time, in Cape Town, despite Italy losing 0–26. In Córdoba Italy beat Argentina for the first time thanks to Leonardo Ghiraldini's try and a late penalty by Marcato. He also coached the Barbarians against the All Blacks in December 2009 with the 'Baa-Baas' winning 25–18.Nick Mallett shows Barbarians how to win by playing positive rugby In 2010 Mallet coached the Barbarians to victory over South Africa. In the 2010 Six Nations, Mallett guided Italy to a 16-12 win against Scotland. Despite this victory, Italy's only win in the competition, they didn't avoid the wooden spoon because Scotland's points difference was just one better. In the 2011 Six Nations Championship Italy beat France by 22–21 in arguably their best victory to date. ===Retirement (2011–present)=== In November 2011, after the World Cup in New Zealand, Nick Mallett's contract as head coach of Italy expired and he returned to Cape Town with Frenchman Jacques Brunel taking over the Italy job. Mallett has stated that he wishes to spend time with his family in South Africa, despite being briefly linked to the position as Coach of England following Martin Johnson's resignation. ==References== ==External links== *SupaRugby: Nick Mallett New Director of Rugby * *Stade Francais *Mallett calls for shake-up in South African rugby Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Villager FC players Category:South African rugby union coaches Category:South African rugby union players Category:South Africa international rugby union players Category:Oxford University RFC players Category:Oxford University cricketers Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:Alumni of St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown Category:Stade Français coaches Category:University of Cape Town alumni Category:South Africa national rugby union team coaches Category:Italy national rugby team coaches Category:Western Province (rugby team) players Category:People from Makhanda, Eastern Cape Category:South African cricketers Category:British Universities cricketers ","title":"Nick Mallett"},{"id":"529998","text":"Omni was a science and science fiction magazine published in the US and the UK. It contained articles on science, parapsychology, and short works of science fiction and fantasy. It was published as a print version between October 1978 and 1995. The first Omni e-magazine was published on CompuServe in 1986 and the magazine switched to a purely online presence in 1996. It ceased publication abruptly in late 1997, following the death of co-founder Kathy Keeton; activity on the magazine's website ended the following April. ==HistoryConcept=== Omni was founded by Kathy Keeton and her long-time collaborator and future husband Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse magazine. The initial concept came from Keeton, who wanted a magazine \\"that explored all realms of science and the paranormal, that delved into all corners of the unknown and projected some of those discoveries into fiction.\\" Dick Teresi, an author and former Good Housekeeping editor, wrote the proposal for the magazine, from which a dummy was produced. In pre-launch publicity it was referred to as Nova but the name was changed before the first issue went to print to avoid a conflict with the PBS science show of the same name.Brown, Charles. \\"Nova coming\\".

The debut edition had an exclusive interview with Freeman Dyson, a renowned physicist, and the second edition carried an interview with Alvin Toffler, futurist and author of Future Shock. ===Fiction=== In its early run, Omni published a number of stories that have become genre classics, such as Orson Scott Card's \\"Unaccompanied Sonata\\", William Gibson's \\"Burning Chrome\\", \\"New Rose Hotel\\" and \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\", and George R. R. Martin's \\"Sandkings\\". The magazine also published original science fiction and fantasy by William S. Burroughs, Joyce Carol Oates, Jonathan Carroll, Julio Cortázar, T. Coraghessan Boyle, and other mainstream writers. The magazine excerpted Stephen King's novel Firestarter, and featured his short story \\"The End of the Whole Mess\\". Omni also brought the works of numerous painters to the attention of a large audience, such as H. R. Giger, De Es Schwertberger and Rallé. In the early 1980s, popular fiction stories from Omni were reprinted in The Best of Omni Science Fiction series and featured art by space artists like Robert McCall. ===Market=== Omni entered the market at the start of a wave of new science magazines aimed at educated but otherwise \\"non-professional\\" readers. Science Digest and Science News already served the high-school market, and Scientific American and New Scientist the professional, while Omni was arguably the first aimed at \\"armchair scientists\\" who were nevertheless well informed about technical issues. The next year, however, Time introduced Discover while the AAAS introduced Science '80. Advertising dollars were spread among the different magazines, and those without deep pockets soon folded in the 1980s, notably Science Digest, while Science '80 merged with Discover. Omni appeared to weather this storm better than most, likely due to its wider selection of contents. In early 1996 publisher Bob Guccione suspended publication of the print edition of Omni, attributing the decision to the rising price of paper and postage. At the end of its print run the circulation was still reported to be more than 700,000 copies a month. In September 1997, Keeton died of complications from surgery for an intestinal obstruction. The staff of Omni Internet was laid off, and no new content was added to the website after April 1998. General Media shut the site down and removed the Omni archives from the Internet in 2003. ==EditionsInternational editions=== Omni magazine was published in at least six languages. The content in the British editions closely followed the North American editions, but with a different numbering sequence. This was mainly accomplished by wrapping the American edition in a new cover which featured British advertising on the inside. At least one British edition was entirely unique and was shipped under the banner of Omni UK. An Italian edition was edited by Alberto Peruzzo and ran for 20 issues from 1981 to 1983, when Peruzzo detached the name Omni from his local edition. The Italian spin-off continued with the name Futura, while maintaining the same graphical style and with an unchanged intended audience, for another twenty issues, up to July 1985. The Japanese edition ran from 1982 to the summer of 1989 and included almost entirely different content to the American edition. The German edition began in 1984 and ended in early 1986.Omni International Editions The first Spanish edition appeared in November 1986 and ran until the summer of 1988. A Russian edition was published in the Soviet Union beginning in September 1989 in conjunction with the USSR Academy of Sciences. These editions were 80% in English and featured both Russian and English advertising. Publisher Guccione arranged for 20,000 copies of the Russian edition to be placed on news stands and onboard internal Aeroflot flights in the Soviet Union in exchange for an equivalent number of copies of Science in Russia being distributed in the USA. Omni ran subscription adverts beginning in August 1989 for Science in Russia. This arrangement was intended to last for one year and was made possible by the Glasnost events in the Soviet Union. ===Webzine=== Omni first began its online presence as part of Compuserve in the summer of 1986. On September 5, 1993 Omni became part of the America Online service. The AOL unveiling took place at the 51st World Science Fiction Convention in San Francisco. AOL subscribers had access to much of the Omni printed archive as well as forums, chat groups and new fiction. After the print magazine folded, the Omni Internet webzine was launched on September 15, 1996. For the first few months the new website was integrated into the AOL service, replacing the existing AOL Omni interface. Now free of pressure to focus on fringe science areas, Omni returned to its roots as the home of gonzo science writing, becoming one of the first large-scale venues to deliver a journalism geared specifically to cyberspace, complete with real-time coverage of major science events, chats and blogs with scientific luminaries, and interactive experiments that users could join. The world's top science fiction writers also joined in, writing collaborative fiction pieces for Omni's readers live online. ===Television=== A short-lived syndicated television show based on the magazine's format (and called Omni: The New Frontier) aired in the United States beginning in September 1981, hosted by Peter Ustinov. A French-language, dubbed version of the show appeared on the Canadian public TV network Radio-Québec (now known as Télé-Québec) in 1994. In 1985, extracts of the 1981 television series were re-edited and repackaged into four television shows hosted by Keir Dullea under the title Omni: Visions of the Future. Episodes were titled Futurebody, Space, Amazing Medicine and Lifestyles in the 21st Century.Omni Advertising ===Comics=== An equally short-lived spin-off magazine called Omni Comix debuted in 1995, and was published in the same glossy, newsstand magazine format as its sister publications Omni, Penthouse and Penthouse Comix. Omni Comix ran for only three issues, and the third and final issue featured an abortive revival of the 1960s superhero series T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents. === Anthologies === From 1983 to 1986, Zebra Books published a series of anthologies containing selected non-fiction content from Omni magazine: * The Omni Book of Space edited by Owen Davies ( published October 1983) * The Omni Book of Computers and Robots edited by Owen Davies ( published October 1983) * The Omni Book of Medicine edited by Owen Davies ( published April 1984) * The Omni Book of the Paranormal & the Mind edited by Owen Davies ( published April 1984) * The Omni Book of Psychology edited by Peter Tyson ( published July 1986) * The Omni Book of High-Tech Society 2000 edited by Peter Tyson ( published September 1986) From 1984 to 1989, Zebra Books also published a series of Science Fiction anthologies containing stories published in Omni magazine with all volumes edited by Ellen Datlow who was also serving as the editor of Omni magazine at the time: * The First Omni Book of Science Fiction ( published January 1984) * The Second Omni Book of Science Fiction ( published January 1984) * The Third Omni Book of Science Fiction ( published April 1985) * The Fourth Omni Book of Science Fiction ( published July 1985) * The Fifth Omni Book of Science Fiction ( published April 1987) * The Sixth Omni Book of Science Fiction ( published March 1989) * The Seventh Omni Book of Science Fiction ( published June 1989) Ellen Datlow also edited and released the following Science Fiction anthologies of stories published in Omni magazine under the OMNI Books imprint: * Omni Best Science Fiction One ( published October 1992) * Omni Best Science Fiction Two ( published November 1992) * Omni Best Science Fiction Three ( published June 1993) * Omni Visions One ( published November 1993) * Omni Visions Two ( published July 1994) ==Editorial staff== The magazine was initially edited by Frank Kendig, who left several months after the magazine's launch. Ben Bova, who was hired as Fiction Editor, was promoted to Editor, leaving the magazine in 1981. After Kendig and Bova, Editors of Omni included Dick Teresi, Gurney Williams III, Patrice Adcroft, Keith Ferrell, and Pamela Weintraub (editor of Omni as one of the first major standalone webzines from 1996–1998). Kathleen Stein managed the magazine's prestigious Q&A; interviews with the top scientists of the 20th century through 1998. Ellen Datlow was Associate fiction editor of Omni under Robert Sheckley for one and a half years, and took over as Fiction Editor in 1981 until the magazine was suspended in 1998. In 2016, two print issues of OMNI were published by members of the original staff, including Weintraub and Datlow. Under the umbrella of PGMI, OMNI was reimagined as a series of print quarterlies starting in 2017, with Pamela Weintraub as Editor-in-Chief and Ellen Datlow as Fiction Editor. Other team members include Robert Killheffer and Corey S. Powell as Executive Editors and Matt Westphalen as Creative Director. ==Ownership== In 2013, Glenn Fleishman undertook a research project with the goal of learning who currently owns the Omni intellectual property, and concluded that the rights to the fiction published in Omni had long since reverted to the original authors (who had only sold first North American publication rights), and that \\"possibly even the current ostensible owner\\" may not know who owns the rights to the rest of the content. ===Reboot=== In August 2013, plans to launch \\"a new online project\\", described as an \\"Omni reboot\\" were reported by The Verge. The project was said to be under the guidance of producer Rick Schwartz and businessman/collector Jeremy Frommer who purchased a storage locker \\"on a whim\\" in November 2012 that was found to contain \\"a sizable chunk of the estate of Bob Guccione\\". The rediscovered materials include \\"cover drafts with greasy pencil notations, thousands of 35-mm slides, large-format chromes, magazines bundled with stapled paperwork, production materials, and untold amounts of photos and artwork.\\" ===Penthouse publishes new Omni=== Penthouse Global Media acquired Omni in 2017, and announced plans for a new print issue, to commence publication on 24 October 2017. The issue was published, and billed as the Winter 2017 issue, the first on a quarterly schedule. ==See also== *Future Life *Galileo ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * * Omni Magazine leads the upsurge of mass-audience science journalism - Lengthy review of the magazine shortly after its introduction. * Omni: The forgotten history of the best science magazine that ever was. * Archived Omni magazines on the Internet Archive Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct science fiction magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1978 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1995 Category:Online magazines with defunct print editions Category:Science fiction magazines established in the 1970s Category:Science and technology magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines published in New York City ","title":"Omni (magazine)"},{"id":"530000","text":"A 200-pin PC2-5300 DDR2 SO-DIMM A 204-pin PC3-10600 DDR3 SO-DIMM A comparison between 200-pin DDR and DDR2 SDRAM SO-DIMMs, and a 204-pin DDR3 SO-DIMM module A SO-DIMM slot on a computer motherboard A SO-DIMM, SODIMM, or small outline dual in-line memory module, is a type of computer memory built using integrated circuits. SO-DIMMs are a smaller alternative to a DIMM, being roughly half the size of regular DIMMs. SO-DIMMs are often used in systems that have limited space, which include laptops, notebooks, small-footprint personal computers such as those based on Mini-ITX motherboards, high-end upgradable office printers, and networking hardware such as routers and NAS devices. == Visual identification == Most types of SO-DIMMs can be recognized visually by the distinctive notches that \\"key\\" them for different applications: * 100-pin SO-DIMMs (SDR SDRAM) have two notches. * 144-pin SO- DIMMs (SDR SDRAM) have a single notch near the center. * 200-pin SO-DIMMs (DDR SDRAM or DDR2 SDRAM) have a single notch nearer to one side. The exact location of this notch varies (read below). * 204-pin SO-DIMMs (DDR3 SDRAM) have a single notch closer to the center than on 200-pin SO-DIMMs. * 260-pin SO-DIMMs (DDR4 SDRAM), wide and high, making them wider than DDR3 SO-DIMMs, with a single notch after pin 144. * 260-pin SO-DIMMs (UniDIMM), wide and or high, with a single notch placed differently than on DDR3 SO-DIMMs. === Variants of 200-pin SO-DIMMs === The 200-pin SO-DIMM can be of the types DDR and DDR2. In both cases the notch is located at one fifth of the board length (20 pins + notch + 80 pins), but in DDR2 the notch is located slightly closer to the center of the board. These two types of memory are not interchangeable. The different notch locations are designed to prevent cross-installation, aiding at the same time in visually identifying 200-pin SO-DIMM modules. This variance is designed to prevent coupling of memory and controllers of different DDR generations due to electrical incompatibility. DDR SO-DIMMs operate at 2.5 V while DDR2 SO-DIMMs operate at 1.8 V. === Variants of DDR3 SO-DIMMs === These modules, while using the same physical layout, may differ in the specified voltage 1.5 or 1.35 volts.

It is a species-typical behavior. == In animals == Individual animals regularly clean themselves and put their fur, feathers or other skin coverings in good order. This activity is known as personal grooming, a form of hygiene. Extracting foreign objects such as insects, leaves, dirt, twigs and parasites is a form of grooming. Among animals, birds spend considerable time preening their feathers. This is done to remove ectoparasites, keep the feathers in good aerodynamic condition, and waterproof them. To do that, they use the preen oil secreted by the uropygial gland, the dust of down feathers, or other means such as dust-bathing or anting. During oil spills, animal conservationists that rescue penguins sometimes dress them in knitted sweaters to stop them from preening and thereby ingesting the mineral oil, which is poisonous. Monkeys may also pick out nits from their fur or scratch their rears to keep themselves clean. Cats are well known for their extensive grooming. Cats groom so often that they often produce hairballs from the fur they ingest. Many mammal species also groom their genitals after copulation. == Grooming as a social activity == Many social animals adapt preening and grooming behaviors for other social purposes such as bonding and the strengthening of social structures. Grooming plays a particularly important role in forming social bonds in many primate species, such as chacma baboons and wedge-capped capuchins. == Mutual grooming in human relationships == In humankind, mutual grooming relates closely to social grooming, which is defined as the process by which human beings fulfill one of their basic instincts, such as socializing, cooperating and learning from each other.Casse, Pierre. (2008-10-14) Social Grooming – A new side to leadership? Dean, Berlin School of Creative Leadership. Retrieved on 2010-09-08 In research conducted by Holly Nelson (from the University of New Hampshire) and Glenn Geher (State University of New York at Paltz), individuals who chose their romantic partner reported more mutual grooming than others who focused in other types of relationships. Hence, this study hypothesized that mutual grooming related to relationship satisfaction, trust and previous experience of affection within the family. They claim that even though humans do not groom each other with the same fervor that other species do, they are groomers par excellence. Therefore, human mutual grooming plays an important role in pair bonding. In the same investigation, researchers found that individuals with more promiscuous attitudes and those who scored high on the anxiety sub-scale on an adult attachment style measure tend to groom their partners more frequently. These findings were also consistent with some of the functions of grooming: potential parental indicator, developing trust and courtship or flirtation. Nelson, Holly and Geher, Glenn. (2007-09-15) Mutual Grooming in Human Dyadic Relationships: An Ethological Perspective Springer Link. Retrieved on 2010-09-08 A recent empirical study by Seinenu Thein-Lemelson (University of California, Berkeley) utilized an ethological approach to examine cross-cultural differences in human grooming as it pertains to caregiving behaviors. Naturalistic data was collected through video focal follows with children during routine activities and then coded for grooming behaviors. This cross-cultural comparison of urban families in Burma and the United States indicates that there are significant cross- cultural differences in rates of caregiver-to-child grooming. Burmese caregivers in the sample groomed children more often than caregivers in the United States. Additionally, children in the United States have short instances of concentrated grooming predominantly during daily activities that are structured explicitly around hygiene goals (bath time), in contrast to the Burmese child, whose grooming is distributed more evenly within and across daily activities. The Burmese parents maintained a constant vigilance with regard to risk of infection. The study is significant because it is the only study of human grooming to utilize naturalistic data. == Gallery == Image:Cat cleaning itself.jpgA domesticated cat grooming.

Timers can be categorized into two main types. A timer which counts upwards from zero for measuring elapsed time is often called a stopwatch, while a device which counts down from a specified time interval is more usually called a timer. A simple example of this type is an hourglass. Working method timers have two main groups: Hardware and Software timers. Most timers give an indication that the time interval that had been set has expired. Time switches, timing mechanisms which activate a switch, are sometimes also called \\"timers.\\" ==Hardware timersMechanical timers=== Mechanical timers use clockwork to measure time. Manual timers are typically set by turning a dial to the time interval desired; turning the dial stores energy in a mainspring to run the mechanism. They function similarly to a mechanical alarm clock; the energy in the mainspring causes a balance wheel to rotate back and forth. Each swing of the wheel releases the gear train to move forward by a small fixed amount, causing the dial to move steadily backward until it reaches zero when a lever arm strikes a bell. The mechanical kitchen timer was invented in 1926 by Thomas Norman Hicks. Some less accurate, cheaper mechanisms use a flat paddle called a fan fly that spins against air resistance; low-precision mechanical egg-timers are sometimes of this type. The simplest and oldest type of mechanical timer is the hourglass, in which a fixed amount of sand drains through a narrow opening from one chamber to another to measure a time interval. ===Electromechanical timers=== thumb Short-period bimetallic electromechanical timers use a thermal mechanism, with a metal finger made of strips of two metals with different rates of thermal expansion sandwiched together; steel and bronze are common. An electric current flowing through this finger causes heating of the metals, one side expands less than the other, and an electrical contact on the end of the finger moves away from or towards an electrical switch contact. The most common use of this type is in the \\"flasher\\" units that flash turn signals in automobiles, and sometimes in Christmas lights. This is a non-electronic type of multivibrator. An electromechanical cam timer uses a small synchronous AC motor turning a cam against a comb of switch contacts. The AC motor is turned at an accurate rate by the alternating current, which power companies carefully regulate. Gears drive a shaft at the desired rate, and turn the cam. The most common application of this timer now is in washers, driers and dishwashers. This type of timer often has a friction clutch between the gear train and the cam, so that the cam can be turned to reset the time. Electromechanical timers survive in these applications because mechanical switch contacts may still be less expensive than the semiconductor devices needed to control powerful lights, motors and heaters. In the past, these electromechanical timers were often combined with electrical relays to create electro-mechanical controllers. Electromechanical timers reached a high state of development in the 1950s and 1960s because of their extensive use in aerospace and weapons systems. Programmable electromechanical timers controlled launch sequence events in early rockets and ballistic missiles. As digital electronics has progressed and dropped in price, electronic timers have become more advantageous. ===Electronic timers=== A simple digital timer. The internal components—including the circuit board with control chip and LED display, a battery, and a buzzer—are visible. Electronic timers are essentially quartz clocks with special electronics, and can achieve higher precision than mechanical timers. Electronic timers have digital electronics, but may have an analog or digital display. Integrated circuits have made digital logic so inexpensive that an electronic timer is now less expensive than many mechanical and electromechanical timers. Individual timers are implemented as a simple single-chip computer system, similar to a watch and usually using the same, mass-produced, technology. Many timers are now implemented in software. Modern controllers use a programmable logic controller (PLC) rather than a box full of electromechanical parts. The logic is usually designed as if it were relays, using a special computer language called ladder logic. In PLCs, timers are usually simulated by the software built into the controller. Each timer is just an entry in a table maintained by the software. Digital timers are used in safety devices such as a gas timer. ==Software timers== These types of timers are not devices nor parts of devices; they exist only as computer code. They rely on the accuracy of a clock generator usually built into a hardware device that runs the software. ===Software applications=== Nowadays when people are using more and more mobile phones, there are also timer apps that mimic the old mechanical timer, but which have also highly sophisticated functions. These apps are also easier to use daily, because they are available at once, without any need to purchase or carry the separate devices, as today timer is just a software application on a phone or tablet. Some of these apps are countdown timers, stopwatch timers, etc. These timer apps can be used for tracking working or training time, motivating children to do tasks, replacing an hour glass in board games, or for the traditional purpose for tracking time when cooking and baking. Apps may be superior to hour glasses, or to mechanical timers. Hour glasses are not precise and clear, and they can jam. Mechanical timers lack the customization that applications support, such as sound volume adjustments for individual needs. Most applications will also offer selectable alarm sounds. Some timer applications can help children to understand the concept of time, help them to finish tasks in time, and help them to get motivated. These applications are especially used with children with special needs like ADHD, Down syndrome, etc., but everybody else can also benefit from them. ===Other types=== Computer systems usually have at least one hardware timer. These are typically digital counters that either increment or decrement at a fixed frequency, which is often configurable, and which interrupt the processor when reaching zero. An alternative design uses a counter with a sufficiently large word size that it will not reach its overflow limit before the end of life of the system. More-sophisticated timers may have comparison logic to compare the timer value against a specific value, set by software, that triggers some action when the timer value matches the preset value. This might be used, for example, to measure events or generate pulse width modulated wave forms to control the speed of motors (using a class D digital electronic amplifier). One specialist use of hardware timers in computer systems is as watchdog timers, that are designed to perform a hardware reset of the system if the software fails. ==See also== *Candle-timers *Countdown *Time lock *Drip irrigation *Egg timer *Hourglass *Intervalometer *Staircase timer *Time switch *Time to digital converter *Water clock ==References== ==External links== * NIST Recommended Practice Guide: Special Publication 960-12 Stopwatch and Timer Calibrations Category:Digital circuits Category:Control devices Category:Home automation Category:Timers ","title":"Timer"},{"id":"530022","text":"Preen may refer to: == Birds == *Preen, personal grooming of a bird's feathers especially by using its beak *Preen gland, also called the uropygial gland, an oil gland found in many bird species *Preen oil, an oil made by the uropygial gland found in many bird species ==Products== *Preen, a trade name for trifluralin == Surname == *Garyn Preen (born 1991), Welsh footballer *Alan Preen (born 1935), former sportsman who played Australian rules football == Social arts & Attire == *Accessories *Foreplay *Fragrance *Hairstyle *Waxing ","title":"Preen"},{"id":"530027","text":"Rebirthing-breathwork is a type of breathwork invented by Leonard Orr.

Holbrookia is a genus of earless lizards, known commonly as the lesser earless lizards, in the family Phrynosomatidae. The genus contains six recognized species, which are found throughout the Southwestern and Central United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by having no external ear openings, presumably to prevent soil from entering their bodies when they are digging. ==Etymology== The generic name, Holbrookia, is in honor of American zoologist John Edwards Holbrook.Beltz, Ellin (2006).

It reaches heights of . However, it can be a shrub on especially poor sites. It prefers dry rocky mountain soils. The bark is smooth, flaky and gray-brown when young, becoming dark gray-red-brown and shallowly furrowed into flat scaly ridges. The twigs are red-brown and often resinous. The leaves are in fascicles of three,eNature Field Guides, 2007 needle-like, yellow-green, twisted, and 9–15 cm (about 3.5–6 in) long. The cones are 8–16 cm long and clustered in whorls of three to six on the branches. The scales end in a short stout prickle. The cones remain closed for many years until a fire opens them and allows reseeding. As a result, the cones may even become embedded in the trunk as the tree grows.

He was working as a bellhop in Pontiac, Michigan, when he was discovered by circus advertising advance man Frederic Harrison Bailey (a nephew of circus pioneer Hachaliah Bailey) as a teenager. F.H. Bailey gave McGinnis a job as his assistant, and the two traveled together for many years. McGinnis eventually adopted F.H. Bailey's surname to become James A. Bailey. Bailey later associated with James E. Cooper, and by the time he was 22, he was manager of the Cooper and Bailey circus. He then met with P.T. Barnum, and together they established Barnum and Bailey's Circus (for which Bailey was instrumental in obtaining Jumbo the Elephant) in 1880, with their combined show opening the following spring in Madison Square Garden. Bailey married Ruth McCaddon of Zanesville, Ohio. Bailey died of erysipelas in 1906 at age 58.

The mountain's name derives from its shape, resembling a suribachi or grinding bowl. It is also known as , since the Volcanic gas and water vapor that rolls in from the summit, alongside the rest of the island, give the appearance of a smoking pipe when viewed from the sea. Joe Rosenthal's iconic World War II photograph, Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, depicting United States Marines raising an American flag, was taken at the mountain's peak during the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Ammunition ship USS Suribachi was named after this mountain. ==Geology== Geologically, the mountain is a cinder cone of andesite, formed by volcanic activity. It is thought that the mountain is a dormant vent to a still active volcano (designated Iō-tō, the name of the island as a whole). From 1889 to 1957, the Japanese government recorded sixteen eruptions on the peak. One eruption lasted for sixty-five minutes, and created a crater with a diameter of 35 meters and a depth of fifteen meters on the runway near the former airfield from World War II. The Japanese Meteorological Agency reported that on May 2, 2012, a small eruption caused water discoloration to the northeast, and confirmed the appearance of a new fumarole. ==History== During World War II, the Japanese built tunnel and bunker systems in and on Mount Suribachi. In February 1945, United States Marines invaded the island and initiated a major battle. For the United States, Iwo Jima was an important strategic point between the United States and mainland Japan, needed as an airstrip for damaged B-29s returning to the Mariana Islands from bombing Japan, a status that resulted in severe fighting that took the lives of nearly 7,000 Americans and 20,000 Japanese. ==In popular culture== *During the Battle of Iwo Jima, photographer Joe Rosenthal took his famous picture, Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima. It depicts Marines raising the American flag on the mountain's peak, and was a re-creation of an earlier flag-raising. The photograph has become an iconic image. *The 1949 film Sands of Iwo Jima, directed by Allan Dwan and starring John Wayne, follows a United States Marine rifle squad preparing for battle at Iwo Jima. The 2006 films Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers, directed by Clint Eastwood, treat the theme of this Pacific battle and present the positions of both belligerents in this conflict. ==References== == External links == * Ioto – Japan Meteorological Agency * Japan Meteorological Agency * Io to – Geological Survey of Japan * Category:Cinder cones Category:Mountains of Tokyo Category:Volcano Islands Category:Volcanoes of Tokyo Category:Active volcanoes ","title":"Mount Suribachi"},{"id":"530078","text":"TDT may refer to: * Digital terrestrial television ** TDT (TV station), a digital television station in Tasmania, Australia ** TDT (Portugal), digital terrestrial television in Portugal ** TDT (Spain), digital terrestrial television in Spain * TDT Band (The Down Troddence), a six piece Indian thrash metal band * TDT Banda or Thamar Dillon Thomas Banda (fl. 1957–1962), Nyasaland politician * Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, a specialized DNA polymerase expressed in immune cells * Terrestrial Dynamical Time, an obsolete name for Terrestrial Time * The Damned Things, an American heavy metal supergroup * Time domain transmissometry, a method of testing transmission lines * Toronto Dance Theatre, a Canadian modern dance company based in Toronto, Ontario * Tracing Debugging Technique, an early debugger by DEC * Transmission disequilibrium test, a family-based genetic association test * The Dark Tower (series), a book series written by Stephen King.

On December 19, 1969, at the age of 36, he was appointed to the Quebec Superior Court and to the Queen's Bench (Crown Side) of the province of Quebec. In 1978, he was elevated to the Quebec Court of Appeal and was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1980. Brian Mulroney named Lamer as Chief Justice on July 1, 1990. Justice Bertha Wilson became the first woman appointed to the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1976 and to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1982. Justice Lamer refused to rise from his chair along with the rest of his colleagues when Justice Wilson entered the conference room for her first judicial conference. On January 7, 2000, Lamer took an unexpected early retirement after having served as Chief Justice for ten years. Several years after his death, former judges spoke about the situation surrounding his retirement. According to a 2011 article in The Globe and Mail, in February 1999, a \\"delegation of three veteran judges\\" including former Supreme Court judge John C. Major, selected by their colleagues met with Lamer to tell him that \\"his performance was not what it had been up until this time.\\" To which he immediately responded, \\"Well, then I'll resign.\\" Lamer finally agreed to resign following a second meeting with Justices Major, Peter Cory and Charles Gonthier in the spring of 1999. He announced in an August 1999 talk to the Canadian Bar Association, that he would be resigning from the Supreme Court in January 2000. After he retired, Lamer joined a large law firm, Stikeman Elliott, in a senior advisory role and was appointed Associate Professor of Law at the Université de Montréal in 2000. He was appointed Communications Security Establishment Commissioner on June 19, 2003, a position he held until August 1, 2006. He also served as Honorary Colonel of the Governor General's Foot Guards. In a CBC interview, Lamer described how the Supreme Court of Canada was transformed following the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms under then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau which expanded the role of the judiciary. Lamer described it as \\"somewhat of a shock to see their job description changed so fundamentally.\\" Eugene Meehan, who was Lamer's first executive legal officer at the Supreme Court of Canada described Lamer as \\"a foundational builder\\", who was \\"one of the key architects of how courts interpret\\" the 1982 Charter\\" ...\\"building on the work of his predecessor as chief justice, Brian Dickson.\\" In March 2003, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador asked Lamer to head a high-profile inquiry into several wrongful convictions in Newfoundland specifically to oversee an inquiry into how the criminal justice system dealt with three discredited murder convictions. The hearings lasted about three years. Lamer was tasked to conduct an investigation into the death of Catherine Carroll and the circumstances surrounding the resulting criminal proceedings against Gregory Parsons, and an investigation into the death of Brenda Young and the circumstances surrounding the resulting criminal proceedings against Randy Druken. Lamer was also asked to inquire as to why Ronald Dalton's appeal of his murder conviction took eight years before it was brought on for a hearing in the Court of Appeal.\\"Government of Newfoundland Labrador News Release\\", June 21, 2006.

In 1956, he graduated in law from the Université de Montréal and was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1957. In 1987, he married Danièle Tremblay-Lamer, who was later appointed a judge on the Federal Court. During his tenure he was well known among the bench to be a frequent consumer of alcohol, especially wine, and have various drug prescriptions to deal with his declining health. Various commentators and even other judges have vocally critiqued these habits of his as reason for him to resign from the court.

In 1808, he purchased an Indian elephant which he named \\"Old Bet\\" and which was one of the first such animals to reach America.(1) . With \\"Old Bet\\" as its main attraction, he formed the Bailey Circus, which also included a trained dog, several pigs, a horse and four wagons. This was the impetus for what in time evolved into the Bailey component of what became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The Elephant Hotel in Somers, New York (2007) Between 1820 and 1825, Bailey built the Elephant Hotel in Somers, New York. The hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Bailey also served two terms in the New York State legislature. In 1837, Bailey sold the hotel and moved to Northern Virginia, bought the land surrounding the intersection of Leesburg Pike and Columbia Pike in Fairfax County, Virginia near Falls Church, Virginia, and gave Bailey's Crossroads his name. The Crossroads then became the winter quarters for his circus. In 1845 Hachaliah returned to Somers for a visit and died from the kick of a horse while there. He is buried in Somers' Ivandell Cemetery. Several of the next generation of Baileys performed in circuses. Hachaliah Bailey served as a role model to a young P.T. Barnum, who wrote of meeting him when Hachaliah visited Barnum's store in Bethel, Connecticut. In 1888, Barnum lent his name to a partnership with James Anthony Bailey, who had adopted the surname of Frederick Bailey, a nephew of Hachaliah's, to form the Barnum and Bailey Circus. ==Early career== Hachaliah Bailey was born in the small village of Somers, New York on July 31, 1775. His parents were James Bailey and Anne Brown Bailey. Hachaliah was one of six children, Mary Bailey, Stephen Bailey, Lewis Bailey, Jane Bailey and Anna Bailey Owens. Like his father, Hachaliah became a farmer where he farmed land and raised cattle. Hachaliah married Mary Purdy and they had five children. Hachaliah Bailey was also known for to find other ways to make an income. He became one of the directors of the Croton Turnpike Company, this eventually turned into a toll road through the middle of Somers where it became a major a major route. This route was used to transport cattle to the Hudson. More ways Hachaliah made a profit was by becoming a part-owner of a sloop which was used to transport farm animals. Hachaliah and many locals frequented a bar called the Bull Head Tavern. This is where Hachaliah bought his elephant Old Bet for only $1,000. Old Bet's name drew from Hachaliah's daughter Elizabeth whose nickname was Young Beth. Old Bet was the second elephant ever to be brought to the United States where Hachaliah brought the elephant to Hudson Valley in 1805 and then New York City in 1806. Old Bet was originally supposed to be used as a draft animal, however, It didn't take long for Hachaliah to realize the rising interest that American's had on exotic animals. Hachaliah then used this intrigue and began traveling at night so no one could get a glimpse of the animal and he would charge 25 cents per person to see Old Bet. Hachaliah then decided to showcase Old Bet in a small circus. After Hachaliah's neighbors saw the booming success the exotic creature brought to Hachaliah, most of his neighbors started buying and showcasing exotic animals. Soon after Somers became known for its intriguing animals. By 1808 Hachaliah took on two partners Benjamin Lent and Andrew Brunn each paying $1200 for one/third of the interest on Old Bet. Hachaliah also owned two more elephants after Old Bet was shot on tour by a local farmer who was angry with the amount of money and attention that was being spent on an elephant. Hachaliah then memorialized Old Bet by creating the Elephant HotelElephant Hotel and building a statue in her honor. ==Marriages and children== Hachaliah Bailey married his wife Mary Purdy when she was fourteen years old and he was twenty-three years old. Together they had five children: * Calista Bailey (1800-1879) * Lewis Bailey (1803-1870) * Jane Bailey (1808-1882) * Joseph Turk Bailey (1810-1881) * Stephen Bailey (1814-1863) Hachaliah Bailey then would split with Mary and later marry his wife Ruth Ferris Bailey where they had no children. ==References== Category:1775 births Category:1845 deaths Category:Circus owners Category:Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus Category:People from Somers, New York Category:19th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Hachaliah Bailey"},{"id":"530082","text":"The Port of Houston is one of the world's largest ports and serves the metropolitan area of Houston, Texas. The port is a 50-mile-long complex of diversified public and private facilities located a few hours' sailing time from the Gulf of Mexico. Located in the fourth-largest city in the United States, it is the busiest port in the U.S. in terms of foreign tonnage, second-busiest in the U.S. in terms of overall tonnage, and sixteenth-busiest in the world. Though originally the port's terminals were primarily within the Houston city limits, the port has expanded to such a degree that today it has facilities in multiple communities in the surrounding area. In particular the port's busiest terminal, the Barbours Cut Terminal, is located in Morgan's Point. The Port of Houston is a cooperative entity consisting of both the port authority, which operates the major terminals along the Houston Ship Channel, and more than 150 private companies situated along Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay. Many petroleum corporations have built refineries along the channel where they are partially protected from the threat of major storms in the Gulf of Mexico. The petrochemical complex associated with the Port of Houston is one of the largest in the world. ==History== Lifting towers at the port of Houston in the late 19th or early 20th century. The original Port of Houston was located at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou in downtown Houston by the . This area is called \\"Allen's Landing\\" and is now a park. It is the birthplace of the City of Houston. Shipping points grew at multiple locations on Buffalo Bayou including the port of Harrisburg (now part of Houston) and the docks on the Allen Ranch. By the end of the 19th century Buffalo Bayou had become a major shipping channel with traffic beginning to rival Galveston. Texas State Historical Association. The citizens of Harris County approved creation of the modern port in 1909, believing that an inland port would better serve the region after the destructive Galveston Hurricane of 1900. President Woodrow Wilson officially opened the port to traffic as the World Port of Houston and Buffalo Bayou on November 10, 1914. In the 1930s the Port became the focus of labor conflict, with sometimes intense battles between strikers and authorities, during the 1935 Gulf Coast longshoremen's strike and the 1936 Gulf Coast maritime workers' strike among other incidents. In 1911, there was a campaign persuading voters to approve a $1.25 million bond to raise money for dredging the waterway. The campaign was successful and voters approved the bond issuance and creation of the Harris County Houston Ship Channel Navigation District that is called Port of Houston Authority (POHA) today. Early supporters would prove to be correct; the port has grown to be one of the world's largest, overtaking the nearby Port of Galveston in significance. In 1977 the Port of Houston opened the Barbours Cut Terminal, Texas' first cargo container terminal, at Morgan's Point. This new terminal, in the Bay Area, quickly became the port's most important terminal. The opening of the Bayport Terminal in 2006 further extended the port authority's reach outside the city of Houston. ==The port today== South Louisiana handling more. Approximately 215 million tons of cargo moved through the Port in 2005, most of which is petroleum related. The Port has two separate terminals dedicated to the handling of cargo containers: Barbours Cut (at Morgan's Point), and Bayport (in Pasadena, opened in October 2006). The Barbours Cut terminal was, in fact, the port's first terminal specifically designed for these shipments. Additional general cargo terminals include Turning Basin, Jacintoport, Woodhouse, and Care. The Port Authority offers a 90-minute free cruise aboard the M/V Sam Houston, details of which can be found on its website. Since the Houston Ship Channel is closed to recreational traffic, this is the only means by which the general public can view port operations, and thus the tours are highly popular. Most Volkswagen (and Audi) automobiles sold in North America pass through the port of Houston. The Port is operated by the Port of Houston Authority, an independent political subdivision of the State of Texas governed by a seven-member commission. The City of Houston and the Harris County Commissioners Court each appoint two commissioners; these two governmental entities also jointly appoint the chairman of the Port Commission. The Harris County Mayors and Councils Association and the City of Pasadena each appoint one commissioner. Daily operations are overseen by an Executive Director who serves at the will of the Commission. A renovation project for the Port's Turning Basin Terminal began in 2010 and is expected to take 10 years. The Turning Basin Terminal is a multipurpose complex with open wharves and 37 docks that are used for direct discharge and loading of breakbulk, containerized, project or heavy-lift cargoes. The goal of the renovation is to accommodate the increase in the transportation of steel, which increased more than 3.1 million tons in the first nine months of 2011, up from 1.9 million tons over the same period in the previous year.The Houston Chronicle ===Trade data=== The Barbours Cut Terminal The Port of Houston is a major point of international trade for the United States.

He attended St. John's High School. He grew up believing he had been born in June, but in fact had been born in March, his parents disguised his true date of birth because he was conceived out of wedlock.Brad Gooch, City Poet: the life and times of Frank O'Hara, p. 15 He studied piano at the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1941 to 1944 and served in the South Pacific and Japan as a sonarman on the destroyer USS Nicholas during World War II. With the funding made available to veterans he attended Harvard University, where artist and writer Edward Gorey was his roommate. O'Hara was heavily influenced by visual art and by contemporary music, which was his first love (he remained a fine piano player all his life and would shock new partners by suddenly playing swathes of Rachmaninoff when visiting them). His favorite poets were Pierre Reverdy,\\"My Heart is in my pocket it is poems by Pierre Reverdy\\" (in Lunch), Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, Boris Pasternak, and Vladimir Mayakovsky. While at Harvard, O'Hara met John Ashbery and began publishing poems in the Harvard Advocate. Despite his love of music, O'Hara changed his major and graduated from Harvard in 1950 with a degree in English. He then attended graduate school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. While at Michigan, he won a Hopwood Award and received his M.A. in English literature in 1951. That autumn O'Hara moved into an apartment in New York City with Joe LeSueur, who was his roommate and sometime lover for the next 11 years. It was during this time that he began teaching at The New School.

Warren, a Canadian ballet dancer, was the inspiration for several of O'Hara's poems, including \\"Poem (A la Recherche d’Gertrude Stein)\\", \\"Les Luths\\", \\"Poem (So many echoes in my head)\\", and \\"Having a Coke With You\\". Warren died on October 25, 2017, 51 years after O'Hara's death. ==Poetry== While O'Hara's poetry is generally autobiographical, it tends to be based on his observations of New York life rather than exploring his past. In his introduction to The Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara, Donald Allen says \\"that Frank O'Hara tended to think of his poems as a record of his life is apparent in much of his work.\\"Frank O'Hara. The Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara. Ed. Donald Allen. University of California Press. 1995; O'Hara discussed this aspect of his poetry in a statement for Donald Allen's The New American Poetry: > What is happening to me, allowing for lies and exaggerations which I try to > avoid, goes into my poems. I don't think my experiences are clarified or > made beautiful for myself or anyone else, they are just there in whatever > form I can find them. . .My formal \\"stance\\" is found at the crossroads where > what I know and can't get meets what is left of that I know and can bear > without hatred. . .It may be that poetry makes life's nebulous events > tangible to me and restores their detail; or conversely that poetry brings > forth the intangible quality of incidents which are all too concrete and > circumstantial. Or each on specific occasions, or both all the time.Frank > O'Hara. The New American Poetry (edited by Donald Allen). Grove Press, 1960; His initial time in the Navy, during his basic training at Sampson Naval Training Center in upstate New York, along with earlier years spent at St. John's High School began to shape a distinguished style of solitary observation that would later inform his poems. Immersed in regimented daily routine, first Catholic school then the Navy, he was able to separate himself from the situation and make witty and often singular studies. Sometimes these were cataloged for use in later writing, or, perhaps more often, put into letters. This skill of scrutinizing and recording during the bustle and churn of daily life would, later, be one of the important aspects that shaped O'Hara as an urban poet writing off the cuff.\\"Digressions on Some Poems by Frank O'Hara\\" by Joe LeSueur \\"City Poet\\" by Brad Gooch Among his friends, O'Hara was known to treat poetry dismissively, as something to be done only in the moment. John Ashbery says he witnessed O'Hara \\"Dashing the poems off at odd moments – in his office at the Museum of Modern Art, in the street at lunchtime or even in a room full of people – he would then put them away in drawers and cartons and half forget them.\\" In the summer of 1951, O'Hara read a manifesto in The Kenyon Review written by the poet, novelist and anarchistic social critic Paul Goodman. In the essay, Goodman argues that the postwar American \\"advanced guard\\" writers must articulate the deep-seated, personal disquiet felt across the culture but left unvoiced. The essay encouraged O'Hara to write poetry that was embarrassing in its directness, and even seen as hostile to literary standards then in place. O'Hara's poetry began to erase poetry's cautious border between what is public and what is private.\\"Into a Future of His Choice: Catching Up with Frank O'Hara\\" by Tim Keane http://brooklynrail.org/2014/06/art/into-a-future-of-his-choice-catching-up- with-frank-ohara In 1959, he wrote a mock manifesto (originally published in Yugen in 1961) called Personism: A Manifesto, in which he explains his position on formal structure: \\"I don't ... like rhythm, assonance, all that stuff. You just go on your nerve. If someone's chasing you down the street with a knife you just run, you don't turn around and shout, 'Give it up! I was a track star for Mineola Prep.'\\" He says, in response to academic overemphasis on form, \\"As for measure and other technical apparatus, that's just common sense: if you're going to buy a pair of pants you want them to be tight enough so everyone will want to go to bed with you. There's nothing metaphysical about it.\\" He claims that on August 27, 1959, while talking to LeRoi Jones, he founded a movement called Personism which may be \\"the death of literature as we know it.\\" He says, > It does not have to do with personality or intimacy, far from it! But to > give you a vague idea, one of its minimal aspects is to address itself to > one person (other than the poet himself), thus evoking overtones of love > without destroying love's life-giving vulgarity, and sustaining the poet's > feelings toward the poem while preventing love from distracting him into > feeling about the person.Frank O'Hara. \\"Personism: A Manifesto\\". The > Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara (edited by Donald Allen). University of > California Press. 1995; His poetry shows the influence of Abstract Expressionism, Surrealism, Russian poetry, and poets associated with French Symbolism. Ashbery says, \\"The poetry that meant the most to him when he began writing was either French – Rimbaud, Mallarmé, the Surrealists: poets who speak the language of every day into the reader's dream – or Russian – Pasternak and especially Mayakovsky, for whom he picked up what James Schuyler has called the 'intimate yell.'\\" As part of the New York School of poetry, O'Hara to some degree encapsulated the compositional philosophy of New York School painters.William Watkin. In the process of poetry: the New York school and the avant-garde. Bucknell University Press, 2001. , .Marjorie Perloff. Frank O'Hara: Poet Among Painters. University of Chicago Press, 1998. , Ashbery says, \\"Frank O'Hara's concept of the poem as the chronicle of the creative act that produces it was strengthened by his intimate experience of Pollock's, Kline's, and de Kooning's great paintings of the late '40s and early '50s and of the imaginative realism of painters like Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers.\\" O'Hara was also influenced by William Carlos Williams, so much so that he lists Williams (along with Hart Crane and Walt Whitman) as one of three poets who were \\"better than the movies.\\" According to Marjorie Perloff in her book Frank O'Hara, Poet among Painters, he and Williams both use everyday language and simple statements split at irregular intervals. Perloff points out the similarities between O'Hara's \\"Autobiographia Literaria\\" and Williams's \\"Invocation and Conclusion\\". At the end of \\"Autobiographia Literaria\\", the speaker says, \\"And here I am, the/center of all beauty!/writing these poems!/Imagine!\\" Similarly, Williams at the end of \\"Invocation and Conclusion\\" says, \\"Now look at me!\\" These lines show a shared interest in the self as an individual who can only be himself in isolation. A similar idea is expressed in a line from Williams's \\"Danse Russe\\": \\"Who shall say I am not/ the happy genius of my household?\\"Perloff, pg. 45 ==In popular cultureIn music=== In First Aid Kit's song \\"To A Poet\\", there is the lyric, \\"But Frank put it best when he said \\"you can't plan on the heart\\"\\", a reference to O'Hara's poem, \\"My Heart\\". In Martha's song \\"1967, I Miss You, I'm Lonely\\", the lyric, \\"I look at you and I am confident that I'd rather look at you than all the portraits in existence in the world, except possibly O'Hara by Grace Hartigan,\\" references both O'Hara's poem, \\"Having a Coke With You\\", and Grace Hartigan's portrait of O'Hara. Rilo Kiley's 2004 album More Adventurous is titled after a line in O'Hara's poem \\"Meditations in an Emergency\\": \\"Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous...\\" The title track references the same line: \\"I read with every broken heart, we should become more adventurous\\" Frankie Cosmos's music is influenced by O'Hara's works, visible in two of her albums, Zentropy and Next Thing. Greta Kline has stated that her stage name derived from the poet. \\"For Frank O'Hara\\" is a 1973 chamber ensemble work by American composer Morton Feldman. Irish artist David Kitt released \\"Having a Coke with You\\", sampling O'Hara's poem, under his New Jackson moniker in 2014. ===In films=== In the 2011 film Beastly, the lovestruck main characters read O'Hara's poem \\"Having a Coke with You\\" aloud to each other. ===In literature=== O'Hara is a minor character in William Boyd's 2002 novel Any Human Heart. O'Hara's Lunch Poems is the basis of Paul Legault's Lunch Poems 2. ===In television=== In the season 1 episode of the HBO series Bored to Death, \\"The Case of the Missing Screenplay\\", the main character loses a screenplay written by Jim Jarmusch about the life of Frank O'Hara. Several episodes of Mad Men (season 2) reference O'Hara's collection of poetry, Meditations in an Emergency. The first episode shows a character reading from it over lunch in a bar (recalling O'Hara's 1964 collection Lunch Poems) as does the last episode, which uses the book's title as its episode title. In the twelfth episode, Don Draper finds his copy of Meditations in an Emergency in Anna Draper's home in California. In the final episode of “Normal People”, based on Sally Rooney’s eponymous novel, Connell gives Marianne a book of Frank O’Hara’s poetry for her birthday. ===In plays=== The poetry of Frank O'Hara features prominently in Rachel Bonds's 2017 play At the Old Place. ===Landmarks=== On June 10, 2014, a plaque was unveiled outside one of O'Hara's New York City residences, at 441 East Ninth Street. Poets Tony Towle, who inherited the apartment from O'Hara, and Edmund Berrigan read his works at the event.Frank O'Hara Lived Here ==Bibliography== * * ===Books published during his lifetime=== * A City Winter and Other Poems.

Pillow fights often occur during children's sleepovers. Since pillows are usually soft, injuries rarely occur. The heft of a pillow can still knock a young person off balance, especially on a soft surface such as a bed, which is a common venue. In earlier eras, pillows would often break, shedding feathers throughout a room. Modern pillows tend to be stronger and are often filled with a solid block of artificial filling, so breakage occurs far less frequently. == Organized pillow fights == Pillow fighting has become a part of flash mob culture, with pillow fight flash mobs popping up in cities around the world. Social media is frequently used to initiate and advertise public pillow fight events. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), occasionally staged \\"pillow fight matches\\" between female wrestlers, then known as Divas, during the early 2000's. These were often booked as Lingerie Pillow Fights, in which women \\"compete\\" in lingerie or pajamas, with little or no actual wrestling taking place. The final match of this type was held in 2008. In January 2007, Reuters reported on a Pillow Fight League that was operating in bars in Toronto.No softies in Canada's campy Pillow Fight League , Reuters, Jan 16 2007 Pre-selected female \\"fighters\\" with stage personalities were paid small amounts to stage regular, unscripted fights. The rules called for \\"no lewd behavior, and moves such as leg drops or tickling or submission holds are allowed as long as a pillow is used.\\" The league ceased operations in 2011, and a crowdfunding campaign created to facilitate its return was unsuccessful. March 22, 2008, was the first World Pillow Fight Day, a day organized in the United States by Newmindspace, a group created by two University of Toronto students. The Wall Street Journal estimated that 5,000 people participated in a New York event coinciding with the day. The Guinness World Record for the largest pillow fight was set in July 2015 at a St. Paul Saints baseball game, where 6,261 participated in an event sponsored by local manufacturer My Pillow. The record was later broken in May 2018 at an evangelical Christian concert. 7,861 people participated in the Minneapolis, Minnesota event, which was also sponsored by My Pillow. == In Japan == In Makura-Nage, the Japanese Pillow fighting variation, players throw pillows instead of swinging them. ==In film== The 25 second long Pillow Fight From Edison Studios Pillow fights were a popular theme in early cinematography. 1897 saw the release of A Pillow Fight by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company followed by Pillow Fight from Edison Studios. In the same year Siegmund Lubin released New Pillow Fight. Lubin returned to the subject in 1903 with the film Pillow Fight, Reversed. Other films to portray pillow fights include Animal House, Annie, and The Room. ==References== ==External links== * International Pillow Fight Day Category:Fight play Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Pillow fight"},{"id":"530099","text":"Robert George Brian Dickson, (May 25, 1916 - October 17, 1998), commonly known as Brian Dickson, was a Canadian lawyer, military officer and judge. He was appointed a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada on March 26, 1973, and subsequently appointed the 15th Chief Justice of Canada on April 18, 1984. He retired on June 30, 1990. Dickson's tenure as chief justice coincided with the first wave of cases under the new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which reached the Supreme Court from 1984 onwards. Dickson wrote several very influential judgments dealing with the Charter and laid the groundwork for the approach that the courts would take to the Charter. ==Early life and family== Dickson was born to Thomas Dickson and Sarah Elizabeth Gibson, in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, in 1916, although the family lived at that time in Wynyard.M.A. MacPherson, \\"About Brian, Bill and Me: Regina Collegiate\\", in DeLloyd J. Guth (ed.), Brian Dickson at the Supreme Court of Canada 1973-1990 (Winnipeg: Canadian Legal History Project, 1998), pp. 1-8. His adolescence and young adulthood occurred during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl years, which hit the Canadian prairies particularly hard. Dickson's father was a bank manager, and the family was eventually transferred to Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. Dickson attended high school at the Central Collegiate, where two of his classmates were William Lederman and Alexander \\"Sandy\\" MacPherson. All three would go into law, with Lederman becoming one of Canada's leading constitutional scholars and MacPherson becoming a justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench. In later years, Dickson would reminisce that \\"Bill was always first in our class, and Sandy and I were fighting for second and third\\". Sandy MacPherson's father was M. A. MacPherson, the attorney general for Saskatchewan. When the Legislature was sitting in the evenings, Dickson and Sandy MacPherson would come in the evenings to the Attorney General's office to do their homework, and then sit in the galleries of the Assembly and listen to the debates. Dickson said that his interest in the law was triggered by that experience. The Dickson family later moved to Winnipeg, where Dickson attended the University of Manitoba after graduating from Ridley College in 1934. He was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity. In 1938, Dickson graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, earning the gold medal for his class.Clarence Shepard, \\"Treasured Memories: Law, Love and War\\", in DeLloyd J. Guth (ed.), Brian Dickson at the Supreme Court of Canada 1973-1990 (Winnipeg: Canadian Legal History Project, 1998), pp. 9-14. His first permanent job was with the Great-West Life Assurance Company, where he worked in the investment section for two years. It was in Winnipeg as a young law student that Dickson met his future wife, Barbara Sellers. They married in Winnipeg in 1943, when Dickson was back from Europe to attend military staff training in Kingston. ==Military career== Dickson was called to the bar in 1940, but before practising law, he enlisted in the Canadian armed forces for active service. He had joined the military reserve in 1939, on the outbreak of World War II. In June 1940, he and his friend from law school, Clarence Shepard, signed up for active duty as second lieutenants with the Royal Canadian Artillery, joining the 38th Field Battery in Winnipeg. In August 1940, he volunteered for overseas service.Great Gunners: Col, The Right Honourable RGB Dickson PC, CC, KStJ, CD (1916-1998) Lieutenant Dickson sailed in February 1941 for Britain with the 3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. His abilities attracted notice and he was chosen for staff training, returning to Canada for a course in 1943, followed with a tour of duty in British Columbia as brigade major with the Royal Canadian Artillery. In 1944, Dickson volunteered to return to Europe as a captain. He was posted to the 2nd Canadian Army Group, Royal Canadian Artillery, and distinguished himself in Normandy, being mentioned in dispatches. In August 1944, during the battle of Falaise Gap, Dickson was hit by friendly fire and severely wounded, leading to the amputation of his right leg. By coincidence, two of his friends, Bill Ledermen and Clarence Shepard, were both serving in the area and witnessed the attack. They later remembered the frantic attempts to have the attack called off, not knowing at the time Dickson was in the target area. He was discharged from the army in April 1945. Years later, when he came to Ottawa, Dickson renewed his ties to the military. In 1983, he accepted the honorary lieutenant-colonelship of the 30th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, and was its honorary colonel from 1988 to 1992. ==Legal career== Dickson returned to Winnipeg in 1945 at the end of the war, joining the law firm of Aikins, Loftus, MacAulay, Turner, Thompson & Tritschler. He became a successful corporate lawyer,Robert Yalden, \\"Before the Bench: Brian Dickson as Corporate Lawyer,\\" in DeLloyd J. Guth (ed.), Brian Dickson at the Supreme Court of Canada 1973-1990 (Winnipeg: Canadian Legal History Project, 1998), pp. 15-34. and also lectured at the Faculty of Law of the University of Manitoba for six years, until 1954. In 1963, he was on a volunteer committee of the Canadian Bar Association (\\"CBA\\") which assisted the Manitoba government in preparing a new Companies Act. Two other volunteers on the committee were Lorne Campbell and Irwin Dorfman, both of whom would later serve as national president of the CBA.\\" 'Midnight Oil' is Burned for Manitoba - - - Corporation Lawyers Tackle Companies Act,\\" October 25, 1963. ==Community involvement== In 1950, Dickson volunteered to be head of the Manitoba Red Cross, on the suggestion of a partner who told him it would only involve a few meetings per year. Instead, Dickson took the position just in time for the 1950 Red River flood, with the Red reaching the highest level since 1861. Winnipeg itself was inundated, 4 of 11 bridges were destroyed, and over 100,000 people had to be evacuated. Dickson took charge of the relief effort by the Red Cross, not seeing his law office for six weeks. Under his direction, the Red Cross mobilised 4,000 volunteers, evacuated thousands and provided support to the people working on the dykes. He later admitted he ran the Red Cross volunteers like an army. Dickson also served as chancellor (legal advisor) for the Anglican Diocese of Rupert's Land.W.H. McConnell, William R. McIntyre: Paladin of Common Law, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2000, p. 82. ==Judicial career== In 1963, Dickson was appointed to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba and in 1967 was elevated to the Manitoba Court of Appeal. He was appointed a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada on March 26, 1973. On April 18, 1984, he was elevated to chief justice of Canada over the more senior Roland Ritchie, who was one year away from mandatory retirement at age 75 and was in ill health.\\"Illness forces Ritchie to retire from Supreme Court,\\" Montreal Gazette, November 2, 1984. During his early years on the Supreme Court, Dickson frequently joined with Justice Laskin and Justice Spence on cases involving civil liberties, often in dissent from the more conservative majority on the Court. The grouping was colloquially referred to as the \\"LSD connection\\".Ian Binnie, \\"Tribute to Bora Laskin \\". Having come from a corporate law background, Dickson often contributed to the judgments in that field. He also developed a reputation as an important authority on constitutional law, originally relating to law of Canadian federalism and later, the groundwork for the new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Dickson participated in the 1981 Patriation Reference, which considered Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's attempt to have the federal government unilaterally patriate the Constitution of Canada without the consent of the provinces. By a 7–2 division, a majority of the Court held that Parliament had the legal authority to act unilaterally. However, by a division of 6–3, the Court also held that unilateral federal action would violate a constitutional convention that had emerged since Confederation, requiring substantial provincial agreement on constitutional amendments. Dickson, along with the three judges from Quebec, was in the majority on both issues: he agreed that Parliament had the legal authority to act unilaterally, but also agreed that a constitutional convention required a substantive degree of provincial agreement for major constitutional amendments.Re: Resolution to amend the Constitution (Patriation Reference), [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753. With the introduction of the Charter in 1982, Dickson made many major contributions to the early standards of interpretation. Among his most famous decisions was that of R v Oakes, where he proposed the analytical framework for section 1 of the Charter now known as the \\"Oakes test\\". In R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd, he gave a broad interpretation to the guarantee of freedom of religion set out in section 2 of the Charter, and in R v Morgentaler, he found that the restrictions on abortions set out in the Criminal Code violated a woman's security of person, contrary to section 7 of the Charter. ==Later life and death== Dickson served on the Supreme Court for 17 years before retiring on June 30, 1990. He died on October 17, 1998, at age 82. ==Honours== In 1990, Dickson was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

Development of the aircraft began in 1938. The first D4Y1 was complete in November 1940 and made its maiden flight at Yokosuka the following month. While the aircraft was originally conceived as a dive bomber, the D4Y was used in other roles including reconnaissance, night fighter and special attack (kamikaze). It made its combat debut as a reconnaissance aircraft when two pre-production D4Y1-Cs embarked aboard the Sōryū to take part in the Battle of Midway in 1942. It was not until March 1943 that it was accepted for use as a dive bomber. The early D4Y1 and D4Y2 featured the liquid-cooled Aichi Atsuta engine, a licensed version of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601, while the later D4Y3 and D4Y4 featured the Mitsubishi MK8P Kinsei radial engine. Like many other Japanese aircraft of the time, the D4Y lacked armor and self-sealing fuel tanks and it was not until the final variant, the D4Y4, that the aircraft was given bulletproof glass and armor protection for the crew and fuel tanks. Nevertheless, the D4Y was one of the fastest dive bombers of the war, particularly the D4Y4 whom Max Gadney said was the \\"fastest dive-bomber of World War II\\" and that it was \\"faster than the Zero\\" if RATO was equipped. Only the delays in its development hindered its service while its predecessor, the slower fixed-gear Aichi D3A, remained in service much longer than intended. Famously, a D4Y was used in one of the final kamikaze attacks in 1945, hours after the surrender of Japan, with Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki in the rear cockpit. ==Design and development== Development of the aircraft began in 1938 at the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal when the Kaigun Kōkū Hombu issued requirements of a Navy Experimental 13-Shi Carrier Borne specification for an carrier-based dive bomber to replace the Aichi D3A. Its design was inspired by the Heinkel He 118 which the Japanese Navy had acquired from Germany in early 1938. The aircraft was a single-engine, all-metal low-wing monoplane, with a wide-track retractable undercarriage and wing-mounted dive brakes. It had a crew of two: a pilot and a navigator/radio-operator/gunner, seated under a long, glazed canopy which provided good all-round visibility. The pilot of bomber versions was provided with a telescopic bombsight. The aircraft was powered by an Aichi Atsuta liquid-cooled inverted V12 engine, a licensed copy of the German DB 601, rated at 895 kW (1,200 hp). The radiator was behind and below the three-blade propeller, as in the P-40 Warhawk. The aircraft had a slim fuselage that enabled it to reach high speeds in horizontal flight and in dives, while it had excellent maneuverability despite high wing loading, with the Suisei having superior performance to contemporary dive bombers such as the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. In order to conform with the Japanese Navy's requirement for long range, weight was minimized by not fitting the D4Y with self-sealing fuel tanks or armour. Subsequently, the D4Y was extremely vulnerable and tended to catch fire when hit. Bombs were fitted under the wings and in an internal fuselage bomb bay. It usually carried one 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb but there were reports that the D4Y sometimes carried two 250 kg (550 lb) bombs, for example during the attack on the light aircraft carrier ; only 30 kg (70 lb) bombs were carried externally. The aircraft was armed with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 97 aircraft machine guns in the nose and a 7.92 mm (.312 in) Type 1 machine gun selected for its high rate of fire, in the rear of the cockpit. The rear gun was replaced by a 13 mm (.51 in) Type 2 machine gun. This armament was typical for Japanese carrier-based dive-bombers, unlike \\"carrier attack bombers\\" (i.e. torpedo bombers) like the Nakajima B5N and B6N which were not given forward-firing armament until the late-war Aichi B7A, which was expected to serve as both a dive-bomber and torpedo-bomber, and was given a pair of 20mm Type 99-2 cannon. The forward machine guns were retained in the kamikaze version. The first (of five) prototypes complete in November 1940 and made its maiden flight in December 1940. After the prototype trials, problems with flutter were encountered, a fatal flaw for an airframe subject to the stresses of dive bombing. Until this could be resolved, early production aircraft were used as reconnaissance aircraft, as the D4Y1-C, which took advantage of its high speed and long range, while not over-stressing the airframe. Production of the D4Y1-C continued in small numbers until March 1943, when the increasing losses incurred by the D3A resulted in production switching to the D4Y1 dive-bomber, the aircraft's structural problems finally being solved. Although the D4Y could operate from the large fleet carriers that formed the core of the Combined Fleet at the start of the war, it had problems operating from the smaller and slower carriers such as the Hiyō class which formed a large proportion of Japan's carrier fleet after the losses of the Battle of Midway. Catapult equipment was fitted, giving rise to the D4Y1 Kai (or improved) model. Yokosuka D4Y1 before takeoff Early versions of the D4Y were difficult to keep operational because the Atsuta engines were unreliable in front-line service. From the beginning, some had argued that the D4Y should be powered by an air-cooled radial engine which Japanese engineers and maintenance crew had experience with, and trusted. The aircraft was re- engined with the reliable Mitsubishi MK8P Kinsei 62, a 14-cylinder two-row radial engine as the Yokosuka D4Y3 Model 33. Although the new engine improved ceiling and rate of climb (over 10,000 m/32,800 ft, and climb to 3,000 m/9,800 ft in 4.5 minutes, instead of 9,400 m/30,800 ft and 5 minutes), the higher fuel consumption resulted in reduced range and cruising speed and the engine obstructed the forward and downward view of the pilot, hampering carrier operations. These problems were tolerated because of the increased availability of the new variant. The last version was the D4Y4 Special Strike Bomber, a single-seat kamikaze aircraft, capable of carrying one 800 kg (1,760 lb) bomb, which was put into production in February 1945. It was equipped with three RATO boosters for terminal dive acceleration. This aircraft was an almost ideal kamikaze model: it had a combination of speed (560 km/h/350 mph), range (2,500 km/1,550 mi) and payload (800 kg/1,760 lb) probably not matched by any other Japanese aircraft. The D4Y5 Model 54 was a planned version designed in 1945. It was to be powered by the Nakajima NK9C Homare 12 radial engine rated at 1,361 kW (1,825 hp), a new four-blade metal propeller of the constant-speed type and more armour for the crew and fuel tanks. Ultimately, 2,038 of all variants were produced, mostly by Aichi. ==Operational history== Yokosuka D4Y3 Model 33 \\"Suisei\\" in flight Lacking armor and self-sealing fuel tanks, the Suiseis did not fare well against Allied fighters. They did, however, cause considerable damage to ships, including the carrier which was nearly sunk by an assumed single D4Y and the light carrier which was sunk by a single D4Y. The D4Y was operated from the following Japanese aircraft carriers: , , , , , , , , , and . The D4Y1-C reconnaissance aircraft entered service in mid-1942, when two of these aircraft were deployed aboard Sōryū at the Battle of Midway, both of which were lost when Sōryū was sunk. ===Marianas=== During the Battle of the Marianas, the D4Ys were engaged by U.S. Navy fighters and shot down in large numbers. It was faster than the Grumman F4F Wildcat, but not the new Grumman F6F Hellcat which entered combat in September 1943. The Japanese aircraft were adequate for 1943, but the rapid advances in American materiel in 1944 (among them, the introduction in large numbers of the Essex-class aircraft carrier) left the Japanese behind. Another disadvantage suffered by the Japanese was their inexperienced pilots. The U.S. Task Force 58 struck the Philippine airfields and destroyed the land air forces first, before engaging Japanese naval aircraft. The result was what the Americans called \\"The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\", with 400 Japanese aircraft shot down in a single day. A single Hellcat pilot, Lieutenant Alexander Vraciu, shot down six D4Ys within a few minutes. One D4Y was said to have damaged the battleship . ===Leyte and Philippines=== suicide dive against , 1256 hours, 25 November 1944. Air brake flaps are extended, the burning port wing tank is trailing smoke. The lack of self-sealing fuel tanks made the D4Y easy to ignite with a few rounds of incendiary tracers, so a stricken Suisei often developed a fiery tail reminiscent of its namesake. Note white \\"17\\" on the vertical tail fin. The D4Y was relegated to land operations where both the liquid-cooled engine D4Y2, and the radial engine D4Y3 fought against the U.S. fleet, scoring some successes. An unseen D4Y bombed and sank the Princeton on 24 October 1944. D4Ys hit other carriers as well, by both conventional attacks and kamikaze actions. In the Philippines air battles, the Japanese used kamikazes for the first time, and they scored heavily. D4Ys from 761 Kōkūtai may have hit the escort carrier on 25 October 1944, and the next day, . Both were badly damaged, especially Suwannee, with heavy casualties and many aircraft destroyed. A month later on 25 November, , , and were hit by kamikazes, almost exclusively A6M Zero fighters and D4Ys, with much more damage. D4Ys also made conventional attacks. All these D4Ys were from 601 and 653 Kōkūtai. ===In defense of the homeland=== Task Force 58 approached southern Japan in March 1945 to strike military objectives in support of the invasion of Okinawa. The Japanese responded with massive kamikaze attacks, codenamed Kikusui, in which many D4Ys were used. A dedicated kamikaze version of the D4Y3, the D4Y4 with a non-detachable 800 kg bomb attached in a semi- recessed manner, was developed. The Japanese had begun installing rocket boosters on some Kamikazes, including the D4Y4 in order to increase speed near the target. As the D4Y4 was virtually identical in the air to the D4Y3, it was difficult to determine the sorties of each type.Ishiguro 2009, p. 25. Carriers and were damaged by D4Ys of 701 Wing on 18 March. On 19 March, the carrier was hit with two bombs from a single D4Y. Franklin was so heavily damaged that she was retired until the end of the war. Another D4Y hit the carrier . On 12 April 1945, another D4Y, part of Kikusui mission N.2, struck Enterprise, causing some damage. During Kikusui N.6, on 11 May 1945, was hit and put out of action by two kamikazes that some sources identify as D4Ys. This was the third Essex-class carrier forced to retire to the United States to repair. ===Night fighter=== The D4Y was faster than the A6M Zero and some were employed as D4Y2-S night fighters against Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers late in the war. The night fighter conversions were made at the 11th Naval Aviation Arsenal at Hiro. Each D4Y2-S had its bombing systems and equipment removed, and replaced by a 20 mm Type 99 cannon installed in the rear cockpit, with the barrel slanted up and forwards in a similar manner to the German Schräge Musik armament fitting (pioneered by the IJNAS in May 1943 on the Nakajima J1N). Some examples also carried two or four 10 cm air-to-air rockets under the wings; lack of radar for night interceptions, inadequate climb rate and the B-29's high ceiling limited the D4Y2-S effectiveness as a night fighter. Little is known of their operations. ===Last action=== At the end of the war, D4Ys were still being used operationally against the U.S. Navy. Among the last of these were 11 aircraft led by Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki on a suicide mission on 15 August 1945, of which all but three were lost. ==Operators== A D4Y3 (Type 33) at NAS Anacostia is tested by U.S. Navy personnel of the Technical Air Intelligence Center after the war. 400px ;The Maru Mechanic 1981, p. 67.Famous Airplanes of the World 1998, pp. 34–40.Model Art 1993, pp. 86–87.Japan Center for Asian Historical Records (JACAR) * Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service * Aircraft carrier ** Sōryū, equipped prototype #3 and #4. ** Shōkaku, supplied from 601st Kōkūtai. ** Zuikaku, supplied from 601st Kōkūtai. ** Taihō, supplied from 601st Kōkūtai. ** Jun'yō, supplied from 652nd Kōkūtai. * Battleship ** Ise, supplied from 634th Kōkūtai. ** Hyūga, supplied from 634th Kōkūtai. * Naval Air Group ** Himeji Kōkūtai ** Hyakurihara Kōkūtai ** Kaikō Kōkūtai ** Kanoya Kōkūtai ** Kantō Kōkūtai ** Kinki Kōkūtai ** Kyūshū Kōkūtai ** Nagoya Kōkūtai ** Nansei-Shotō Kōkūtai ** Ōryū Kōkūtai ** Tainan Kōkūtai ** Taiwan Kōkūtai ** Tōkai Kōkūtai ** Tsuiki Kōkūtai ** Yokosuka Kōkūtai ** 12th Kōkūtai ** 121st Kōkūtai ** 131st Kōkūtai ** 132nd Kōkūtai ** 141st Kōkūtai ** 151st Kōkūtai ** 153rd Kōkūtai ** 201st Kōkūtai ** 210th Kōkūtai ** 252nd Kōkūtai ** 302nd Kōkūtai ** 352nd Kōkūtai ** 501st Kōkūtai ** 502nd Kōkūtai ** 503rd Kōkūtai ** 521st Kōkūtai ** 523rd Kōkūtai ** 531st Kōkūtai ** 541st Kōkūtai ** 552nd Kōkūtai ** 553rd Kōkūtai ** 601st Kōkūtai ** 634th Kōkūtai ** 652nd Kōkūtai ** 653rd Kōkūtai ** 701st Kōkūtai ** 721st Kōkūtai ** 722nd Kōkūtai ** 752nd Kōkūtai ** 761st Kōkūtai ** 762nd Kōkūtai ** 763rd Kōkūtai ** 765th Kōkūtai ** 901st Kōkūtai ** 951st Kōkūtai ** 1001st Kōkūtai ** 1081st Kōkūtai * Aerial Squadron ** Reconnaissance 3rd Hikōtai ** Reconnaissance 4th Hikōtai ** Reconnaissance 61st Hikōtai ** Reconnaissance 101st Hikōtai ** Reconnaissance 102nd Hikōtai ** Attack 1st Hikōtai ** Attack 3rd Hikōtai ** Attack 5th Hikōtai ** Attack 102nd Hikōtai ** Attack 103rd Hikōtai ** Attack 105th Hikōtai ** Attack 107th Hikōtai ** Attack 161st Hikōtai ** Attack 251st Hikōtai ** Attack 263rd Hikōtai * Kamikaze ** Chūyū group (picked from Attack 5th Hikōtai) ** Giretsu group (picked from Attack 5th Hikōtai) ** Kasuga group (picked from Attack 5th Hikōtai) ** Chihaya group (picked from 201st Kōkūtai) ** Katori group (picked from Attack 3rd Hikōtai) ** Kongō group No. 6 (picked from 201st Kōkūtai) ** Kongō group No. 9 (picked from 201st Kōkūtai) ** Kongō group No. 11 (picked from 201st Kōkūtai) ** Kongō group No. 23 (picked from 201st Kōkūtai) ** Kyokujitsu group (picked from Attack 102nd Hikōtai) ** Suisei group (picked from Attack 105th Hikōtai) ** Yamato group (picked from Attack 105th Hikōtai) ** Kikusui-Suisei group (picked from Attack 103rd Hikōtai and Attack 105th Hikōtai) ** Kikusui-Suisei group No. 2 (picked from Attack 103rd Hikōtai and Attack 105th Hikōtai) ** Koroku-Suisei group (picked from Attack 103rd Hikōtai) ** Chūsei group (picked from 252nd Kōkūtai and Attack 102nd Hikōtai) ** Mitate group No. 3 (picked from Attack 1st Hikōtai and Attack 3rd Hikōtai) ** Mitate group No. 4 (picked from Attack 1st Hikōtai) ** 210th group (picked from 210th Kōkūtai) ** Niitaka group (picked from Attack 102nd Hikōtai) ** Yūbu group (picked from Attack 102nd Hikōtai) ; * United States Navy operated captured aircraft for evaluation purposes. ==Variants== The Maru Mechanic 1981, pp. 65–66.Famous Airplanes of the World 1998, pp. 18–33.

The term originated from the stories of DC Comics superhero, Superman. The stories also use \\"Kryptonian\\" as an adjective to refer to anything created by or associated with the planet itself or the cultures that existed on it. Members of the dominant species of the planet Krypton are indistinguishable from humans in terms of their appearance; their physiology and genetics; however, they are vastly different. In some continuities Kryptonians are difficult to clone because their DNA is so complex that human science is not advanced enough to decipher it. The cellular structure of Kryptonians allows for solar energy to be absorbed at extremely high levels. On the planet Krypton, whose parent star has often been depicted as an ancient red supergiant with a relatively low energy output, their natural abilities were the same as humans. When exposed to a young yellow star like Earth's Sun, which is much smaller than their own sun and with a vastly higher energy output, their bodies are able to absorb and process so much energy that it eventually manifests as vast superhuman powers (such as superhuman strength, superhuman speed, invulnerability, flight, x-ray vision, heat vision and superhuman senses). Almost all Kryptonians were killed when the planet exploded shortly after the infant Kal- El was sent to Earth. In some continuities, he is the planet's only survivor. == Physiology and powers == Kal-El can lead an alter ego as Clark Kent because Kryptonians appear identical to humans. Also, in both Silver Age and Modern Age continuity, Kryptonians have more than one ethnic group, such as dark- skinned Kryptonians from Krypton's Vathlo Island that resemble Earth humans of Sub-Saharan African descent and a group from the continent of Twenx that resemble Earth Asian and Latino peoples. In the first stories about Superman's origins, all Kryptonians possess on their homeworld the same powers Superman has on Earth. In later depictions, their abilities are attributed to the differences between Earth's gravity and that of Krypton and the different radiation of the stars they orbit. Kryptonians use solar energy from yellow, blue, orange or white stars on the cellular and molecular levels to gain superhuman abilities. The light of dwarf stars, pulsars, and quasars also grants Kryptonians different abilities.Superman: Earth One Some stories also show that Kryptonians have bioelectric fields that surround their bodies and protect them from harme.g., All-Star Superman and which are the means by which Kryptonians fly. Certain individuals (including Conner Kent, Chris Kent, and some Phantom Zone criminals) have sometimes been depicted with \\"tactile telekinesis\\". The abilities of Kryptonians evolve and grow more powerful as Kryptonians age and develop.Smallville Mating between Kryptonians and other species is difficult because Kryptonian DNA is so complex as to be nearly incompatible with that of other species. The only notable exception is represented by the original native Daxamite population (the race that bore that name before intermingling with the Kryptonian explorers, who later adapted the name for themselves). Breeding between Kryptonian explorers and this race created a new Kryptonian hybrid race that could interbreed with a larger number of humanoid races—including Earth humans. No other races are yet known to exhibit the same degree of compatibility of the native Daxamites. However, in some continuations humans are not only able to reproduce with Kryptonians, but are able to create fertile offspring with them.Superman Annual #14 (2009) Superpowered Kryptonians are vulnerable to kryptonite, radioactive remnants of Krypton, magic and Red Suns . == Culture and technology  Comics === Kryptonians are a highly culturally and technologically advanced people. Self-grown crystals, both natural and synthetic, which covered the vast majority of their planet's surface gave their homeworld a bluish hue when viewed from space and underlay Kryptonian technology. Relatively small crystals can hold vast amounts of information. The Fortress of Solitude is often portrayed as a recreation of Krypton's surface and a storehouse for all the knowledge that the Kryptonian race had obtained. A pictographic crest or symbol represents each Kryptonian family, or House; the head of the House usually wears it. According to the Superman movie and sequels, a shape similar to the Latin letter \\"S\\" represents the House of El, for example. Superman wears this same symbol on his costume, which therefore serves a dual purpose: it displays his Kryptonian heritage, as well as functioning as the \\"S\\" for Superman. Male Kryptonians are identified by hyphenated names, which identify both them and their houses, such as \\"Jor-El\\" and \\"Kal-El\\" (of the House of El). Female Kryptonians have one given name but take their father's name as their last name. For example, Kal-El's mother is named Lara Lor-Van, taken from her father's name (Lor-Van). The different Houses were also broken up into a loosely-based caste system as well. The Religious, Artist, Military and Science castes had representation on the ruling council, while the Worker caste did not. The different castes lived in buildings with different architectural styles that represented various styles throughout Krypton's history. The severe xenophobia of Kryptonian society conveniently explains Kal-El's being the first Kryptonian to leave the planet. Non-superpowered Kryptonians are genetically dependent to their home planet; as such, Kal-El was sent to Earth as a newly conceived embryo within a birthing matrix in order to survive in Earth's atmosphere. He was also devoid of any Kryptonian minerals, because any such minerals would turn to kryptonite upon leaving Krypton's atmosphere.All-Star Superman Kryptonians are evolutionarily related to the also-severely xenophobic Daxamites. The Daxamites remain that way up through the 31st century. Kryptonian law did not believe in capital punishment. Instead, the worst criminals were sent to the Phantom Zone, despite a lack of understanding of the nature of the zone, its danger to the imprisoned and the presence of exits.The Phantom Zone mini- series, 1993 Krypton's red sun was named Rao. It was worshiped by the Kryptonians as a deity (albeit in a more scientific and rational way as the giver and sustainer of all life on the planet). While many Kryptonians wear brightly colored clothes on a daily basis, formal occasions such as funerals and certain council meetings require everyone to wear white. The white formal clothes are often luminescent. === Television === The Kryptonian society, as described in Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (at least, according to what was seen of its surviving colony) is ruled by aristocracy. Arranged marriages between the members of nobility are common, sometimes as early as birth (as was revealed to be the case with Kal-El), and numerous concubines are allowed. Settling of noble disputes by private duels is fully legal (although highly uncommon) and apparently gives advantages in terms of reputation. Criminals are punished for capital crimes by having their bodies dispersed across the universe (the process is reversible, at least until a certain stage). All Kryptonians are capable of long range telepathic communication. The society is highly pragmatic and the Kryptonians seen were surprised and displeased with Clark's unwillingness to kill. Unlike in the comics, the main clothing color seen is black. In Supergirl, some of the elements, like their black clothing and telepathy, was retained except that the shields featured a different letter, indicating a different House other than Zor-El's. This shield is worn on the right shoulder. Like in Smallville, a number of criminals imprisoned by the Kryptonians in the Phantom Zone are from other planets and have different powers from those of either Superman or Supergirl. == Language and alphabet  Comics === For most of Superman's published history, Kryptonian writing was represented by random, alien-looking squiggles. In the 1970s, E. Nelson Bridwell attempted to rationalize these squiggles into a 118-letter alphabet, referring to the language as \\"Kryptonese\\". This standardized alphabet was then used by DC Comics until John Byrne's 1986 \\"reboot\\" of the Superman universe.Turniansky, Al. \\"The Kryptonese Alphabet: A Real-World Historical Tale\\", in Eury, Michael. The Krypton Companion (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2006), p. 32. In 2000, DC introduced a transliteration alphabet for the written language, dropping the \\"Kryptonese\\" moniker in favor of the more commonly assumed \\"Kryptonian.\\" All such writing appearing in the comic books is actually just the language of publication (English in the US and UK, French in France, etc.) written using this transliteration alphabet to replace the native alphabet with a one-to-one correspondence, in a similar fashion to Interlac in Legion of Super-Heroes. === Smallville === On the television series Smallville, depictions of the written Kryptonian language began, primarily, with English transliterated into the official Kryptonian transliteration font – mirroring the practice of the comics. The style of these depictions has since evolved over the life of the series from decipherable transliterated writing to a more stylized (and indiscernible) form. In the process, an increasing amount of logographic components have been added with symbols that have been explained to represent words, ideas, or names. In the episode \\"Gemini\\", a character muttering in an unconscious state is revealed to be speaking Kryptonian. === Superman/Batman: Apocalypse === In the Superman/Batman: Apocalypse movie, a mix of gibberish and Esperanto is used to depict Kryptonian dialogue spoken by both Superman and Supergirl. === Man of Steel === The 2013 film Man of Steel featured Kryptonian writing created by graphic designer Kirsten Franson. The mechanics of the writing system (an abugida), as well as the Kryptonian language that it depicts (which was not spoken in the film), were created by Dr. Christine Schreyer, a linguistic anthropologist and assistant professor of anthropology working at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan. The writing can be seen in several places on Superman's suit in the subsequent films Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017). === Supergirl === On the television series Supergirl the official Kryptonian transliteration font is used for depictions of the Kryptonian language in various scenes throughout the series. In season 3, episodes 2, 6, 7 and 13 featured a few short lines of Kryptonian dialogue using words from the language created by Darren Doyle, citing the first time a constructed Kryptonian language (as opposed to gibberish) has been spoken in any official media. == Calendar  Comics === In the 1970s and 1980s, details about the Kryptonian calendar as it existed in the Earth-One universe were revealed. The Kryptonian time units were defined as follows:Krypton Chronicles #1-3 (Sept.-Nov. 1981) and elsewhere * 100 thribo (Kryptonian seconds) per dendar (Kryptonian minute). * 100 dendaro (Kryptonian minutes) per wolu (Kryptonian hour). * 10 woluo (Kryptonian hours) per zetyar (Kryptonian day). * six zetyaro (Kryptonian days) per fanff (Kryptonian week). * 73 zetyaro (Kryptonian days) per lorax (Kryptonian month). * 438 zetyaro (Kryptonian days) per amzet (Kryptonian year). * 73 fanffo (Kryptonian weeks) per amzet (Kryptonian year). * six loraxo (Kryptonian months) per amzet (Kryptonian year). * The six loraxo (months) were: Belyuth, Ogtal, Ullhah, Eorx, Hefralt and Norzec.Letters page of Superman #254 (July 1972) (Note: In the Kryptonian language, the suffix \\"o\\" indicates the plural form of a noun.) According to one story, in which the Phantom Zone prisoner Quex-Ul had served his full sentence, 18 Kryptonian sun- cycles (amzeto) is about 25 Earth years.Superman #157 (Nov. 1962) It can be demonstrated that one Kryptonian sun-cycle is approximately 1.37 Earth years, as follows: * Superman was born on 35 Eorx 9998,Action Comics #429 (Nov. 1973), World Of Krypton #2 (Aug. 1979) and elsewhere which occurred on February 29World's Finest Comics #235 (Jan. 1976), Superman Annual #11 (1985) and elsewhere in the Earth calendar. * Krypton exploded earlySuperman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #98 (Dec 1966) on 39 Ogtal 10000,World Of Krypton #3 (Sept. 1979) and elsewhere which occurred on June 16The \\"1976 Super DC Calendar\\" and elsewhere in the Earth calendar (Superman arrived on Earth two days later, on June 18Superman #263 (April 1973), World's Finest Comics #235 (Jan. 1976) and elsewhere). * Therefore, there were 734 Kryptonian days (1.676 Kryptonian years) between the two events. * Since 18 Kryptonian years is about 25 Earth years, then there were approximately 2.3 Earth years between the two events. * The exact number of days between February 29, and June 16 two years later, is 838 (or 2.294 years). * Thus, 1.676 Kryptonian years equals 2.294 Earth years, or 1 Kryptonian year equals roughly 1.37 Earth years. Using this ratio of 1.37 Earth years per Kryptonian year (amzet), and ignoring any potential Kryptonian leap day and any differences in time of day, one can approximate other units of time: * 1.37 years per amzet * 0.99 seconds per thrib (31,556,952 seconds/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/43,800,000 thrib) * 1.65 minutes per dendar (525949.2 minutes/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/438,000 dendar) * 2.74 hours per wolu (8765.82 hours/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/4,380 wolu) * 1.14 days per zetyar (365.2425 days/year * 1.37 years/amzet * one amzet/438 zetyar) Major events in the Kryptonian calendar include:World Of Krypton #1-3 (July-Sept. 1979) and elsewhere * Jor-El and Lara were married on 47 Ullhah 9997. * The city of Kandor was stolen by Brainiac on 33 Ogtal 9998. * Kal-El (Superman) was born to Jor-El and Lara on 35 Eorx 9998. * The Phantom Zone became an official method of punishment, and Jax-Ur became its first prisoner, on 67 Eorx 9999. * Kal-El's pet dog, Krypto the Superdog, was lost in space on 54 Belyuth 10000. * Jor-El launched the Phantom Zone projector into space on 30 Ogtal 10000. * Lar Gand of Daxam landed on Krypton and met Jor-El on 34 Ogtal 10000. * Kal-El was sent in an interstellar rocketship towards Earth and Krypton exploded on 39 Ogtal 10000. == Survivors  Comics === When Krypton was destroyed, it was thought that the entire Kryptonian race was destroyed. This was untrue – the scientist Jor- El managed to send his newborn son, Kal-El, off-planet to Earth right before Krypton's demise. Kal-El grew up on Earth as Clark Kent and eventually discovered his Kryptonian origins. Superman's cousin Supergirl also survived Krypton's destruction, as did Kristin Wells, who had been on the run in space at the time of the planet's destruction. Kryptonian survivors of alternate worlds, such as Power Girl (Kara Zor-L) and the canine Krypto the Superdog, also reside on Earth. Kryptonians General Zod and Ursa had been imprisoned within the Phantom Zone prior to Krypton's destruction and even went on to have a child, who would later be adopted as Christopher Kent. The Kryptonian city Kandor was also spared from destruction, as it was shrunken and collected by Brainiac. Kryptonian people live there in standard but microscopic, non- superpowered lives. Also, the inhabitants of the planet Daxam are descendants of Kryptonians who long ago ventured into space and settled on another planet. As such they possess similar powers and abilities to traditional Kryptonians when exposed to a yellow sun. The monster Doomsday is the last of the prehistoric Kryptonians. On Earth-Two, the Kryptonian Val-Zod (Superman) survive Krypton, along with Kara Zor-L/Karen Starr (Power Girl). === Film === In Superman, teenage Clark discovers who he is in the Fortress of Solitude, where a hologram of Jor-El tells him, \\"You are the only survivor of the planet Krypton.\\" This remark appears to prove untrue in Superman II, as prisoners of the Phantom Zone, such as General Zod, also survive the destruction of Krypton. However, Zod and his lieutenants only survived because they were at that time incarcerated within the Phantom Zone and were not in fact on Krypton at the time of its destruction. The film Supergirl shows inhabitants of Argo City who also survived, including Superman's cousin Supergirl. In Superman Returns, it is revealed that Clark is father to the half-Kryptonian child Jason White. In Man of Steel, Kryptonians are depicted as a genetically- engineered race of beings. They are artificially grown in \\"genesis chambers\\" using information from the Codex, a skull containing the entire genetic code of the Kryptonian race. With this method, Kryptonians are designated pre- determined roles in society at their conception – for example, Jor-El is a Scientist, whereas General Zod is a Warrior. In ancient times, they were a race in the midst of an era of expansion, travelling to other worlds via scout ships in order to colonize them. Kal-El is the first (and technically, last) naturally-born Kryptonian in centuries, as Jor-El and Lara believed that Krypton had lost the freedom of choice and wanted their son to choose to become who he wanted to be. As in the comics, Kal-El's powers are depicted as being superior to other Kryptonians, due to his spending a far greater period of time exposed to Earth's yellow sun and atmosphere, though some have an advantage over him in terms of combat experience (e.g. Zod, Faora and Nam-Ek). While the other Kryptonians receive great strength and speed from Earth's sun, they require solar-suits to regulate the radiation and avoid being stricken by pain. In addition, it is shown that without some form of training, Kryptonians are left vulnerable to their own abilities, as the case with Zod when Superman destroyed his solar-visor and caused him to develop a sensory overload. === Television === In Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, it was shown that a sizable Kryptonian colony (called New Krypton) has survived the destruction of the planet. Clark had to go to the colony as its official ruler, but returned to Earth soon after. In Smallville, Clark Kent initially believes himself to be the last survivor of Krypton. However, his father Jor- El's memories remains sentient in the mysterious Kawatche Caves and Fortress of Solitude an disembodied AI, and the disembodied spirit of Zod is similarly sentient albeit trapped in the Phantom Zone. In Season Five, Clark discovers that the Disciples of Zod: Nam-Ek & Aethyr and a Kryptonian artificial intelligence: Brain-Interactive-Construct aka Brainiac arrive on Earth, serving Zod's trapped spirit. In Season Six, Clark discovers his father's assistant Raya was spared by being placed in the Phantom Zone, with her body intact. She helped Clark on Earth until her death a short time after her escape from the Phantom Zone. Season Seven introduces Kara Zor-El, having been sent to Earth at the same time of Clark but trapped in suspended animation since then; later, through schemes put into practice before his death, Clark's uncle Zor-El and mother Lara are resurrected with powers intact for a time. Later, it is revealed that another Kryptonian, the scientist Dax-Ur, has been living on Earth for over a hundred years, using blue kryptonite to render himself powerless, and has even fathered a son with his human wife. Dax-Ur is killed soon after by Brainiac. In Season 8, it is revealed that Zod's wife Faora, also a disembodied wraith, was sent into the Phantom Zone with her husband, but not before they genetically engineered their son, fusing genetic material taken from the most violent Kryptonian life-forms with their own. The child was attached to Clark's ship in the form of a cocoon; on Earth it assumed a human form and became known as Davis Bloome, but would periodically assume its true form: the monster Doomsday. In the season finale, Zod makes his first full bodied appearance on the series, along with a large number of other Kryptonians who are later revealed to be clones created as part of an old experiment. Initially powerless due to their cells having been treated with blue kryptonite radiation, these clones later gain powers when Clark is forced to provide Zod with a sample of his blood to heal him after he is shot, Zod using this blood to empower his followers. The clones are relocated to a new world that they designate 'New Krypton' at the conclusion of Season Nine, with Clark Kent remaining on Earth and Zod being sent to the Phantom Zone to merge with his original self when the clones learn that Zod killed his lover Faora for objecting to his plans. In Superman: The Animated Series and later Justice League Unlimited, the only survivors of Krypton are Clark and two Phantom Zone criminals (Jax-Ur and Mala, introduced in \\"Blasts From the Past\\", parts 1 and 2). Kara In-Zee, alias Supergirl, is the lone survivor of Argos, Krypton's sister planet knocked out by the planet's explosion; however, in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Fearful Symmetry\\", Doctor Emil Hamilton, who has examined Superman, calls her DNA \\"Kryptonian\\", indicating that Argosians are genetically related to Kryptonians. Failed clones of Superman (the mentally handicapped Bizarro and the monstrous Doomsday) and Supergirl (the sociopathic Galatea) are later created. In Legion of Super Heroes, the citizens of Kandor, Superman and his clone Superman-X, might all be considered surviving Kryptonians. In Supergirl, another Kryptonian House was revealed, this one led by Alura Zor-El's twin sister, General Astra. Her shield featured a \\"Q\\" on her uniform, indicating that besides her niece Kara, she and her house survived the destruction of Krypton, along with the Kryptonian prisoners sentenced by Alura (and who are working under Astra) that crash-landed on Earth via the prison ship Fort Rozz. One of Astra's operatives, Vartox, was ordered to sabotage the Department of Extra-Normal Operations by causing a plane crash that was thwarted by Supergirl (when she realized her sister Alex Danvers, a DEO member, was on board), and to alert Astra that Kara survived the explosion and now has come into discovering her powers. In \\"Hostile Takeover\\" more Kryptonians, led by Astra's husband Non, surfaced on Earth preparing for take over of the planet, and came prepared to counter the kryptonite weapons with anti-kryptonite body armor. === Video games === In the One Earth Regime universe featured in Injustice: Gods Among Us and Injustice 2, Krypton is attacked by the rogue Coluan scientist Brainiac. The Kryptonians find themselves at the mercy of Brainiac's forces and Kara Zor-El barely escapes the destruction of Argo City. Her mother Alura rescues her from Brainiac's drones and reveals she and Jor-El have both been working to create two ships, one for Kara and the other for her baby cousin Kal-El. Kara and Kal-El escape Krypton as it is destroyed by Brainiac, though Kara's ship is damaged by the explosion knocking it off course and putting Kara into hyper sleep. Kal-El is raised on Earth as Clark Kent and becomes Superman. As Superman he forms the Justice League and befriends Batman. However, the Joker ends up tricking Superman into attacking Lois Lane, who was pregnant with Superman's child. This results in her death which triggers a nuclear explosion that destroys Metropolis. Superman murders the Joker and establishes a tyrannical government called the One Earth Regime. However, Batman, opposed to Superman's methods, forms the Insurgency to overthrow the Regime. With the aid of the Justice League from another universe, the Regime is defeated and the Insurgency works to rebuild. However, Superman's ally, Black Adam, finds Kara's ship and brings her to Earth. Together they free Superman's current lover Wonder Woman from imprisonment on Themyscira. Wonder Woman and Black Adam hide the tyrannical nature of the Regime from Supergirl and train her to use her powers in secret, though Brainiac attacks Earth after being alerted to Kal-El's survival due to his Regime's supporting the Sinestro Corps. in a war with the Green Lantern Corps. Supergirl and the Regime try to break Superman out of prison, but are stopped by Batman and his allies, though Batman decides to release Superman, calling a temporary truce between the Regime and the Insurgency to combat Brainiac. During Brainiac's attack on Metropolis, Supergirl witnesses Wonder Woman's brutal attack on their ally Harley Quinn after Harley tried to stop Wonder Woman from killing the Cheetah, as it violated Batman's no-killing policy. Supergirl saves Harley's life and confronts her cousin at the Fortress of Solitude. Supergirl is horrified to learn her cousin approves of Wonder Woman's actions, though he believes it would be best to deal with Harley after Brainiac is dealt with. Supergirl compares his methods to General Zod's and briefly fights Superman and his allies, though Brainiac's attack forces them to focus on dealing with him first. Superman and Supergirl work together to attack Brainiac's ship, but are stopped by its barrier. Brainiac destroys Metropolis reminding Superman of his past failure, causing him to attack the ship with all his might, only to be seemingly killed by Brainiac. Batman confronts the grieving Supergirl and reveals that Superman was once his friend. Believing Kara is the last surviving Kryptonian, Brainiac offers to spare Earth if they hand over Kara Zor-El as he wishes to study the effects of yellow sun radiation on Kryptonian cells, though Batman refuses. Batman, his allies and the remaining Regime members manage to overload the shields protecting Brainiac's ship. Batman and Supergirl manage to infiltrate the ship, but Supergirl is captured, though Batman discovers that Superman is still alive and the two join forces to defeat Brainiac and free Supergirl. However, after Brainiac's defeat, Superman and Batman argue over Brainiac's fate, leading to an end to their truce. Despite Brainiac being responsible for Krypton's destruction, Supergirl sides with Batman and choose to spare Brainiac so he can help them restore the worlds and cities he has collected. Supergirl tries to reason with her cousin by telling him of how his father opposed General Zod, only for Superman to reveal he agrees with Zod's methods, believing that if Jor-El had been more like Zod, then he would have been able to save Krypton. In Superman's story mode ending, Batman is defeated, though Superman spares him due to not wanting him to become a martyr. Superman merges with Brainiac's ship and imprisons Supergirl in his former cell. He reveals that all the cities have been restored and Earth is once again under the control of the Regime. Superman reveals there is still a place for her and that he is creating an army using beings freed from Brainiac's collection. Supergirl refuses to join him, though Superman reveals he has used Brainiac's technology to turn Batman into a brainwashed slave and threatens to do the same to Kara if she continues to resist. In Batman's story mode ending, Superman is defeated by Batman after Kara leads him to the Batcave. Batman apologizes to Kara for not being able to save her cousin. Superman is taken prisoner and Batman decides to imprison him in the Phantom Zone. Superman vows to escape and is hurt by Supergirl's betrayal. Supergirl reveals to Batman the House of El's S symbol is supposed to be a symbol of hope; though her cousin turned it into a symbol of fear, Batman, however, states that its meaning is determined by the one who wears it and tells her of how he and Superman used to fight for justice as members of the Justice League, before offering her a chance to do the same, having earned Batman's trust. In Supergirl's character ending, she joins Batman's Justice League, working with them to restore Kandor and cities collected by Brainiac. Supergirl notes that while she could not save her cousin, it will not stop her from trying to bring people hope. She is last shown flying with other Kryptonian survivors in the sky of a restored Kryptonian city. In Sub-Zero's ending, Superman joins forces with Kryptonian criminals General Zod, Ursa and Non after escaping the Phantom Zone through a portal accidentally created by the Batman's Justice League while trying to create a portal to Earthrealm. Sub-Zero confronts Superman, while Supergirl faces General Zod, and Batman battles Ursa and Non. In Injustice: Gods Among Us, General Zod appears as a DLC character, though he plays no role in the game's story. In Injustice 2, Power Girl appears as an alternate character skin for Supergirl, though she does not appear in the main story and originates from Earth-2. == See also == *Krypton glossary == References == == External links == * * Kryptonian.info—information about the various incarnations of the Kryptonian language over Superman's history ** E.

Most commonly it is found in computer motherboards for communication with the power source for ON/OFF instructions. It is derived from I²C for communication with low-bandwidth devices on a motherboard, especially power related chips such as a laptop's rechargeable battery subsystem (see Smart Battery System). Other devices might include temperature, fan or voltage sensors, lid switches and clock chips. PCI add-in cards may connect to an SMBus segment. A device can provide manufacturer information, indicate its model/part number, save its state for a suspend event, report different types of errors, accept control parameters and return status. The SMBus is generally not user configurable or accessible. Although SMBus devices usually can't identify their functionality, a new PMBus coalition has extended SMBus to include conventions allowing that. The SMBus was defined by Intel and Duracell in 1994. It carries clock, data, and instructions and is based on Philips' I²C serial bus protocol. Its clock frequency range is 10 kHz to 100 kHz. (PMBus extends this to 400 kHz.) Its voltage levels and timings are more strictly defined than those of I²C, but devices belonging to the two systems are often successfully mixed on the same bus. SMBus is used as an interconnect in several platform management standards including: ASF, DASH, IPMI. SMBus is used to access DRAM configuration information as part of serial presence detect. SMBus has grown into a wide variety of system enumeration use cases other than power management. ==SMBus/I²C Interoperability== While SMBus is derived from I²C, there are several major differences between the specifications of the two busses in the areas of electricals, timing, protocols and operating modes. smbus.org smbus.org nxp.com 090429 maxim-ic.com ===Electrical=== Input Voltage (VIL and VIH) When mixing devices, the I²C specification defines the input levels to be 30% and 70% of the supply voltage VDD, which may be 5 V, 3.3 V, or some other value. Instead of relating the bus input levels to VDD, SMBus defines them to be fixed at 0.8 and 2.1 V. SMBus 2.0 supports VDD ranging from 3 to 5 V. SMBus 3.0 supports VDD ranging from 1.8 to 5 V. Sink Current (IOL) SMBus 2.0 defines a ‘High Power’ class that includes a 4 mA sink current that cannot be driven by I²C chips unless the pull-up resistor is sized to I²C-bus levels. NXP devices have a higher power set of electrical characteristics than SMBus 1.0. The main difference is the current sink capability with VOL = 0.4 V. *SMBus low power = 350 μA *SMBus high power = 4 mA *I²C-bus = 3 mA SMBus ‘high power’ devices and I²C-bus devices will work together if the pull-up resistor is sized for 3 mA. Frequency (FMAX and FMIN) The SMBus clock is defined from 10–100 kHz while I²C can be 0–100 kHz, 0–400 kHz, 0–1 MHz and 0–3.4 MHz, depending on the mode. This means that an I²C bus running at less than 10 kHz will not be SMBus compliant since the SMBus devices may time out. Many SMBus devices will however support lower frequencies. SMBus 3.0 adds 400 kHz and 1 MHz bus speeds. Timing *SMBus defines a clock low time-out, TIMEOUT of 35 ms. I²C does not specify any timeout limit. *SMBus specifies TLOW:SEXT as the cumulative clock low extend time for a slave device. I²C does not have a similar specification. *SMBus specifies TLOW:MEXT as the cumulative clock low extend time for a master device. Again I²C does not have a similar specification. *SMBus defines both rise and fall time of bus signals. I²C does not. *The SMBus time-out specifications do not preclude I²C devices co-operating reliably on the SMBus. It is the responsibility of the designer to ensure that I²C devices are not going to violate these bus timing parameters. ===Protocols=== ACK and NACK usage There are the following differences in the use of the NACK bus signaling: In I²C, a slave receiver is allowed to not acknowledge the slave address, if for example it's unable to receive because it's performing some real time task. SMBus requires devices to acknowledge their own address always, as a mechanism to detect a removable device's presence on the bus (battery, docking station, etc.) I²C specifies that a slave device, although it may acknowledge its own address, may decide, some time later in the transfer, that it cannot receive any more data bytes. I²C specifies that the device may indicate this by generating the not acknowledge on the first byte to follow. Other than to indicate a slave's device-busy condition, SMBus also uses the NACK mechanism to indicate the reception of an invalid command or datum. Since such a condition may occur on the last byte of the transfer, it is required that SMBus devices have the ability to generate the not acknowledge after the transfer of each byte and before the completion of the transaction. This is important because SMBus does not provide any other resend signaling. This difference in the use of the NACK signaling has implications on the specific implementation of the SMBus port, especially in devices that handle critical system data such as the SMBus host and the SBS components. SMBus protocols Each message transaction on SMBus follows the format of one of the defined SMBus protocols. The SMBus protocols are a subset of the data transfer formats defined in the I²C specifications. I²C devices that can be accessed through one of the SMBus protocols are compatible with the SMBus specifications. I²C devices that do not adhere to these protocols cannot be accessed by standard methods as defined in the SMBus and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specifications. Address Resolution Protocol The SMBus uses I²C hardware and I²C hardware addressing, but adds second-level software for building special systems. In particular its specifications include an Address Resolution Protocol that can make dynamic address allocations. Dynamic reconfiguration of the hardware and software allow bus devices to be ‘hot-plugged’ and used immediately, without restarting the system. The devices are recognized automatically and assigned unique addresses. This advantage results in a plug-and-play user interface. In both those protocols there is a very useful distinction made between a System Host and all the other devices in the system that can have the names and functions of masters or slaves. Time-out feature SMBus has a time-out feature which resets devices if a communication takes too long. This explains the minimum clock frequency of 10 kHz to prevent locking up the bus. I²C can be a ‘DC’ bus, meaning that a slave device stretches the master clock when performing some routine while the master is accessing it. This will notify to the master that the slave is busy but does not want to lose the communication. The slave device will allow continuation after its task is complete. There is no limit in the I²C-bus protocol as to how long this delay can be, whereas for an SMBus system, it would be limited to 35 ms. The SMBus protocol just assumes that if something takes too long, then it means that there is a problem on the bus and that all devices must reset in order to clear this mode. Slave devices are not then allowed to hold the clock LOW too long. Packet Error Checking SMBus 1.1 and later define optional Packet Error Checking (PEC). In that mode, a PEC (packet error code) byte is appended at the end of each transaction. The byte is calculated as CRC-8 checksum, calculated over the entire message including the address and read/write bit. The polynomial used is x8+x2+x+1 (the CRC-8-ATM HEC algorithm, initialized to zero). SMBALERT# The SMBus has an extra optional shared interrupt signal called SMBALERT#, which can be used by slaves to tell the host to ask its slaves about events of interest. SMBus also defines a less common \\"Host Notify Protocol\\", providing similar notifications but passing more data and building on the I²C multi-master mode. ==Support== SMBus devices are supported by FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Linux, Windows 2000 and newer and Windows CE. == See also == * List of network buses * Embedded controller (EC) * Super I/O * Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) * Redfish (specification) * Low Pin Count (LPC) * Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) * Platform Environment Control Interface (PECI) * Host Embedded Controller Interface (HECI) * Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) * Power Management Bus (PMBus) * System Management Controller (SMC) * PCI Express * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) == References == == External links == * * Official SMBus specifications (free) * SBS forum * SMBus at tech- faq.com Category:Computer-related introductions in 1995 Category:Serial buses Category:Out-of-band management Category:Intel products Category:Battery charging Category:Computer hardware standards ","title":"System Management Bus"},{"id":"530115","text":"Siberian Husky puppy A husky is a sled dog used in the polar regions. One can differentiate huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style. They represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs (the Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, pulled heavier loads at a slower speed). Humans use huskies in sled-dog racing. Various companies have marketed tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions. Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure- trekking dogs. ==Etymology== The word husky originated from the word referring to aboriginal Arctic people, in general, Eskimo, \\"...known as 'huskies', a contraction of 'Huskimos', the pronunciation given to the word 'Eskimos' by the English sailors of trading vessels.\\"Dictionary of Newfoundland English, by George Morley Story, W. J. Kirwin, John David Allison Widdowson, pg 263, University of Toronto Press 2004, The use of husky is recorded from 1852 for dogs kept by Inuit people. ==Lineage== Nearly all dogs' genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic breeds also show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture: the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog (which are also historically associated with Arctic human populations) and to a lesser extent, the Shar Pei and Finnish Spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland Dog indicates a best- fit of 3.5% shared material; however, an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data and indicates admixture between the Taimyr wolf and the ancestors of these four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment, contributing significantly to the development of the husky. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region. ==Characteristics== A Siberian Husky with heterochromia looks straight at the camera Huskies are energetic and athletic. They usually have a thick double coat that can be gray, black, copper red, or white.The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English 2009 online http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/husky.aspx. The double coat generally protects huskies against harsh winters and, contrary to what most believe, they can survive in hotter climates. During the hotter climates, huskies tend to shed their undercoat regularly to cool their bodies. In addition to shedding, huskies control their eating habits based on the season; in cooler climates, they tend to eat generous amounts, causing their digestion to generate heat, whilst in warmer climates, they eat less. Their eyes are typically pale blue, although they may also be brown, green, blue, yellow, or heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of uveitis than most other breeds.Uveodermatologic syndrome, http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/courses/vet_eyes/conotes/con_chapter_11.html ==Breeds== A husky sitting on a city sidewalk Husky-type dogs originally were dog landraces kept by the Arctic indigenous peoples. Examples of these landraces in modern times have been selectively bred and registered with various kennel clubs as modern purebred breeds, including the Siberian Husky and the Labrador Husky. The Sakhalin Husky is a extinct Japanese sled dog related to the Japanese Spitz and the Akita. The Mackenzie River husky is a dog subtype referring to different dog populations in the subarctic regions of the American state of Alaska and Canada. The Alaskan husky is not considered a pure breed, but is instead another dog subtype. It is defined only by its purpose, which is that of a highly efficient sled dog. ==Alternative activities== Since many owners now have huskies as pets in settings that are not ideal for sledding, other activities have been found that are good for the dog and fun for the owner. * Skijoring is an alternative to sled pulling, but mainly used in somewhat the same environment, as sledding with the exception that the owner (cross-country skier) does not need a full pack in order to participate. * Dog hiking is an alternative for owners who live closer to woodland trails. The owner travels with their dogs along trails in the wilderness. This activity allows the owner and dog to gain exercise without using the huskies' strong sense of pulling. Some companies make hiking equipment especially for dogs in which they may carry their own gear, including water, food, and bowls for each. * Carting, also known as dryland mushing or sulky driving, is an urban alternative to dog sledding. Here, the dog can pull a cart that contains either supplies or an individual. These carts can be bought or handmade by the individual. * Bikejoring is an activity where the owner bikes along with their dog while they are attached to their bike through a harness which keeps both the dog and owner safe. The dog or team of dogs can be attached to a towline to also pull the biker. ==In popular culture== * The phrase three dog night, meaning it is so cold you would need three dogs in bed with you to keep warm, originated with the Chukchi people of Siberia, who kept the Siberian husky landrace dog that became the modern purebred breed called the Siberian Husky. * Huskies are the mascots of several post-secondary institutions in the United States, including the University of Washington, the University of Connecticut, the Houston Baptist University, Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, Northeastern University, Michigan Technological University, Northern Illinois University, St. Cloud State University, University of Southern Maine, and the University of Wisconsin- Marathon County. They are also the mascots for Saint Mary's University (Halifax), George Brown College (Toronto), and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. * The World War II Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 was called \\"Operation Husky\\". * Sledding huskies have been featured in motion pictures, including Eight Below, Iron Will, and Snow Dogs, and in the animated film Balto. * The Twilight Saga, which features werewolves, and the TV series Game of Thrones, which heavily featured dire wolves during season one, are thought to have inspired a surge in popularity for husky breeds; however, animal charities have also seen a massive increase in owners abandoning the dogs as they become too difficult. * The 2019 Entertainment Studios computer animated film Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad features two huskies as some of its main characters. ==References== Category:Dog types Category:Sled dog breeds ","title":"Husky"},{"id":"530118","text":"Suisei is Japanese for \\"comet\\" and the Japanese name for the planet Mercury.

The lake is formed by the confluence of the Neches and Sabine Rivers and connects to the Gulf of Mexico through Sabine Pass. It forms part of the Texas–Louisiana border, falling within Jefferson and Orange Counties in Texas and Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Sabine Lake is one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. Much of the Louisiana shore is protected by the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge. There is a long history of human habitation around the lake, including Native American settlement dating back at least 1,500 years, European exploration in the eighteenth century, and the growth of Port Arthur in the twentieth century. Today the lake serves as part of the Sabine–Neches Waterway and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and is a center for the shipping and petrochemical industries. ==History== Archaeological evidence indicates that Native American groups from the Marksville culture were present near the shores of Sabine Lake by . Burial mounds that may have belonged to the Karankawa have been uncovered near the north shore at what is now Port Neches, but by the time of European arrival in the eighteenth century the region was inhabited by the Atakapa. English explorers led by George Gauld mapped the lake in 1777; Spanish explorers under Antonio Gil Y'Barbo visited the lake the same year, and an expedition under José Antonio de Evia mapped the lake in 1785 as part of a survey of the Texas coast. In the early 1800s Sabine Lake was used to ship slaves and other contraband into the region by smugglers including the pirate Jean Lafitte. The waterway was also used to move timber and cotton out from the interior. With the 1801 Treaty of Aranjuez the lake became part of the border between French Louisiana and Spanish Texas. After the Louisiana Purchase Sabine Lake formed part of the United States' border with Spanish Texas, then Mexican Texas, and finally the Republic of Texas. During the Republic period the American and Texan customs agencies came into significant conflict over the taxation of shipping on the lake, but with the Texas annexation Sabine Lake instead became part of the border between the U.S. states of Louisiana and Texas. The lake's shores were only intermittently settled and abandoned in the mid-to-late 1800s, and the 1886 Indianola hurricane destroyed the only significant settlements nearby at Sabine Pass and Johnson Bayou. The inlet at Sabine Pass was dredged and deepened in 1880 to ease access to the lake for shipping. In 1895 Port Arthur was founded, and the southwestern edge of the lake was channelized from Sabine Pass to Port Arthur in 1899, forming the Port Arthur Canal. The discovery of petroleum under Spindletop in 1901 began the Texas oil boom and caused rapid economic growth in nearby Beaumont, prompting interest in expanding the region's canal system. By 1908 Sabine Lake's channel was extended northward to the mouths of the Neches and Sabine Rivers to improve shipping access to the ports of Beaumont and Orange, forming the Sabine–Neches Canal; the region's combined channel system is known as the Sabine–Neches Waterway. The material dredged up in the canalization was formed into Pleasure Island, an artificial barrier island along the majority of the western shore that shelters Port Arthur and the waterway. Most of the Louisiana shore was protected within the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge in 1937. In the early twentieth century the lake and its shipping channel were incorporated into a wider network of canals running from New Orleans to Galveston Bay; after World War II this network grew into the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. ==Features== Sabine Lake viewed from Pleasure Island in Port Arthur Sabine Lake is located on the Gulf Coastal Plain at the Texas–Louisiana border. The natural portions of the lake have a mean low-water depth of at most around , though the ship channels have been dredged to a depth of more than . The eastern (Louisiana) shore has little human development, and the majority is protected within the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge; the western (Texas) shore is heavily urbanized, with the city of Port Arthur and significant shipping and petrochemical infrastructure along the shore. Pleasure Island parallels the western shore for , separating the Port Arthur Canal and Sabine–Neches Canal from the main body of the lake. The Martin Luther King Bridge spans the Sabine–Neches Canal to link Port Arthur to Pleasure Island, and the Sabine Causeway connects the island to the Louisiana shore across the southern tip of the lake. Water exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Sabine Pass. Sabine Lake is the smallest of the seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, approximately long and wide, with a surface area of . It receives the discharge from the Neches and Sabine Rivers, along with various smaller streams and the surrounding coastal watershed. The lake's small size and high rate of freshwater inflow make it the least saline of the major Texas estuaries. Its salinity was even lower prior to the twentieth century, and its upper reaches were almost entirely fresh, but the extensive channelization of the lake since then has led to increased saltwater intrusion into the estuary, with salinity rising especially during periods of low freshwater inflow. Increasing salinity has had a negative impact on the diversity and productivity of wetland plants in the estuary. ==Ecosystem== blue crab, the most commercially important fishery species in Sabine Lake The dominant species of aquatic vegetation in Sabine Lake is Ruppia maritima. Aquatic fauna include a variety of finfish and shellfish, with large populations of sport fishing species such as Atlantic croaker, spotted seatrout, southern flounder, red and black drum, sheepshead and gafftopsail catfish. Other significant fish species include the bay anchovy, Gulf menhaden and spot. Commercial fishing in the lake produces mainly shellfish, especially blue crab and penaeid shrimp such as northern brown shrimp and Atlantic white shrimp. Sabine Lake is the only major Texas estuary that does not support a commercial American oyster fishery, as it lacks a suitable reef and is too polluted for legal oyster harvesting. The land around the lake includes a blend of Western Gulf coastal grasslands and coastal marsh ecosystems, together with urban land cover in Port Arthur and its suburbs on the western shore. The majority of the non- urbanized shoreline is surrounded by brackish marshes, with halophytes such as cordgrasses and common reeds as the dominant flora. These coastal wetlands provide habitats for American alligators, Atlantic ridley sea turtles, red wolves and brown pelicans. Saltwater intrusion and land subsidence resulting from human activities in the lake since the late 1800s have caused vegetation loss and erosion, and the remaining marshes are experiencing ongoing degradation as the ecosystems adjust to the altered hydrology in the estuary. ==Industry== Petrochemical industry along the Texas shore of Sabine Lake The channelization of Sabine Lake has made it an important industrial waterway, one component of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the heart of the Sabine–Neches Waterway. The three ports it links to the Gulf of Mexico (Port Arthur, Beaumont and Orange) form a major nexus for the shipping and petrochemical industries, the so-called Golden Triangle of Texas. The largest industries around the lake are petroleum and natural gas extraction, petrochemical processing, shipping, and shipbuilding. Agriculture also forms a significant component of the regional economy, principally rice and soybean cultivation, livestock ranching, and commercial fishing. == References Category:Lakes of Louisiana Category:Lakes of Texas Category:Estuaries of Louisiana Category:Estuaries of Texas Category:Bodies of water of Cameron Parish, Louisiana Category:Bodies of water of Jefferson County, Texas Category:Bodies of water of Orange County, Texas Category:Gulf Coast of the United States ","title":"Sabine Lake"},{"id":"530150","text":"Dagobert or Taginbert is a male given name, possibly from Old Frankish Dag \\"day\\" and beraht \\"bright\\".

Savage is immortal, and he has plagued the Earth with crime and violence since before the beginning of recorded human history. He is a brilliant yet sadistic tactician with immense technological prowess. He is one of DC's most persistent villains and has fought hundreds of heroes throughout history. In 2009, Vandal Savage was ranked as IGN's 36th-greatest comic book villain of all time. Vandal Savage, under the name \\"Curtis Knox\\", made his live-action debut in Smallville, portrayed by Dean Cain. The character was later introduced into The CW's Arrowverse, where he was portrayed by Casper Crump. He was the main antagonist in \\"Heroes Join Forces\\", the crossover between season two of The Flash and season four of Arrow, and during the first season of Legends of Tomorrow, later making a cameo appearance in the latter's fourth season. ==Publication history== Vandal Savage first appeared during the Golden Age of Comic Books in Green Lantern vol. 1 #10 (December 1943), and was created by Alfred Bester and Martin Nodell. In October 1947, Vandal Savage was one of the six original members of the Injustice Society, who began battling the Justice Society of America in All Star Comics #37 (Oct 1947). He returned in the Silver Age in The Flash #137 (June 1963). ==Fictional character biography== In the days of prehistory, 50,000 BC, Savage was a caveman named Vandar Adg, leader of the Cro-Magnon Wolf Tribe. He was bathed in the radiation of a mysterious meteorite, which gave him incredible intellect and immortality. An observer from the Bear Tribe would later approach that same meteorite and become Savage's eternal nemesis, the Immortal Man, possessing the power to resurrect as a new person every time he is killed. According to Lex Luthor, there may be evidence to suggest that Savage was the first cannibal on record. Though the Calculator took this to be a joke, Luthor was apparently serious, and Savage has not shown much regard for human life. In the Pre-Crisis universe, Savage was native to Earth-Two, but as seen in Action Comics #516, thousands of years in the past a sorcerer revealed to him both the future existence of the Justice Society (even showing him a battle he would have with them, with Hourman in their ranks), and the existence of Earth-One. Savage's first mark in the history came when he and a select group of people successfully undermined and destroyed the lost city of Atlantis. That group of people became known as the Illuminati, with Savage serving as its leader. He claims to have ruled hundreds of civilizations under hundreds of names: Khafre, Cheops (builder of the pyramids), Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Blackbeard, and Vlad the Impaler, to name a few. He also terrorized Victorian era London as Jack the Ripper. He realized that his prominence could cause him to be killed accidentally, so he decided to work behind the scenes. He has also worked as close friends and advisers to the likes of Erik the Red, William the Conqueror (whom he advised to invade England under the name Sir Von Savage), Napoleon Bonaparte (whom he served as Marshal Savage), Otto von Bismarck (whom he helped to invade France as Baron Von Savage), and Adolf Hitler. He also led the Spanish Armada in its attempted invasion of England (suggesting he may have been Alonso Pérez de Guzmán). He was the court physician in France and even used the royal family for syphilis experiments. Following DC's 2011 reboot of its continuity, The New 52, Vandal Savage is revealed to have been a part of the Demon Knights, an informal band of medieval-based characters operating in the Middle Ages of the DCU, opposing Mordru after the Fall of Camelot. This incarnation of Vandal Savage was less of a threatening, scheming villain and more a likeable, roguish thug. Savage was still a force to be reckoned with, but nonetheless bound to a deep-seated respect for \\"his fellow immortals\\" Etrigan and Madame Xanadu, even taking a place among the assembled heroes.Demon Knights #1-3 (2011) He is eventually thought to be a traitor.Demon Knights #5 (January 2012). DC Comics Savage ends up betraying Mordru in turn in order to pillage the supplies of the Horde.Demon Knights #7 (March 2012). DC Comics He rejoins the rest of the Demon Knights, saying that he planned this all along. It is unknown whether or not he is telling the truth. This behavior is more in line with the present- day Vandal Savage. During the Golden Age, Savage battled the Justice Society of America after first meeting Green Lantern. He attempted to capture the members of the Justice Society out of revenge and place them in suspended animation using technology developed by the Injustice Society of the World member Brainwave, but was thwarted by the Golden and Silver Age Flashes (Jay Garrick and Barry Allen), Barry travelling to Earth-2 after mysterious blackouts happened in cities where JSA members lived. He used a weapon to make them fight each other, captured Jay after the younger Barry beat him, and tried to capture Barry, trying to use an illusion to trap Barry in a suspended animation container. But Barry realized his trick and freed the heroes. This caused the JSA to revive.Flash #137 (1962, Savage's first Silver Age appearance) Savage would continue to make various attacks on the Justice Society in later stories. He was also one of the founding members of the Injustice Society, who were each assigned to capture or kill a JSA member and engineer five jailbreaks to each attack a location in an attempt to conquer the United States. While leading an army of prison escapees from Gartmoor prison whom he had incited to riot by dropping leaflets about the ISW from a plane, he attacked an airport where Federal planes were about to land, and captured Hawkman, before Green Lantern impersonated the Thinker during the 'trial' of the JSA and freed the JSA, who jailed the villains. He briefly formed a group of villains called Tartarus. After the events of the 2008 \\"Final Crisis\\" storyline, Savage found himself hardly affected by the event, aside from gaining more enemies. Knowing his developed hatred for the Justice Society, the re-installation of a new team consisting of superheroes within the modern time known as the Justice League, quickly gained Savage's attention to where he did not hesitate on forming a group of villains to make an attack on this new team so that they would not pose any threat towards Savage's future goals. Yet, none would gain any more hatred from Savage than the supposed new Immortal Man, which was the mysterious Resurrection Man. Over time, Savage forgot many of his special powers, and never exhibited them to Barry Allen. After his recent fallout with the Justice League, Vandal Savage decided to take care of each member individually, starting with the newest Flash (Wally West). During this time, he operated the Villers Gallery, an antique salon on Fifth Avenue in New York City. A private investigator by the name of Harold Halston from Thermopolis, Wyoming had been investigating one Varney Sack at the request of a local realtor. Sack turned out to be Savage, and the immortal man killed Halston once he figured the private eye knew too much. In a showdown at the Club Neon, Wally, with the help of Frances Kane, fought Savage. He fell out of a window, but he disappeared before he hit the ground. Savage surfaced again later, this time selling Velocity 9, a highly addictive super-speed drug of his own creation, which interfered with much of the existing drug trade in New York. He put an ad in the paper that attracted successful yuppies, whom he used to do his bidding by giving them Velocity 9 so they could perform high speed crimes. However, these junkies aged at magnificent rates and suffered strokes very easily. Savage wished to use the heroin distribution network of mob boss Nick Bassaglia to distribute Velocity 9 to lawyers and stockbrokers, hoping to gain financial control of New York. However, Flash, who had gone looking for Bassaglia after he was kidnapped by Savage, was injected with Velocity 9. After giving him a short spurt of incredible speed, it took away his powers. Hoping that a second dose would make him another one of his junkies, Savage told Dr. Conrad Bortz to inject the Flash, who instead injected Savage, who ran away. He reappeared later, wanting money to leave the country. This money he attempted to acquire by kidnapping Rosie, the daughter of Wally's landlord, Mr. Gilchrist, with a ransom of five million dollars. He set many traps for the Flash, who was looking for Rosie, that led him to Barry Allen's grave, where Rosie was being kept. However, throughout all of this, Savage never showed his face. He is one of the main villains in the JLA: Year One storyline, working against the recently formed JLA, and harboring a deep hatred towards superheroes and the invading alien Appellaxians. During one confrontation with the aliens, Savage claims to have designed Stonehenge itself, which the aliens have just partially demolished. Savage also mentions that he shut down the Justice Society with \\"a few well-placed senators\\". ===Immortal Man=== Ultimately, Savage's enemy the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Mitch Shelley, the Resurrection Man, an amnesiac with similar powers which actually came from nanobots, took over as Savage's nemesis. However, Savage's list of foes is not limited to those two characters. Having lived so long, Savage has butted heads with possibly every single hero featured in the DC Universe, most notably the Justice Society of America and the Justice League of America. Original Green Lantern Alan Scott (in comics, his very first opponent) has been portrayed as one of Savage's main enemies, as well as the original Flash, Jay Garrick. It has been revealed that Savage refers to Hawkman—who has been reincarnated for a few millennia—as \\"the cockroach\\". At present, in the DC Universe, Savage is about 54,001 years old, although different numbers have been given in the past, from one million years in his first depiction, to 31,637 years in recent issues of JSA: Classified. ===DC One Million=== In this series, it is learned Savage has a base deep inside the Egyptian Sphinx. A confrontation with the Martian Manhunter leaves him with a burnt-out eye, which seemingly afflicts him far into the future. Savage will possibly meet his end after he has lived to the year A.D. 85,271 (as seen in the DC One Million storyline), when he is sent back in time to 20th-century Montevideo, Uruguay, by a pair of doctored time traveling gauntlets, seconds before it is obliterated by a Rocket Red armorsuit carrying a huge nuclear payload, an action that was, ironically, ordered by Savage himself (Savage was hoping to use the gauntlets to move only through space and arrive at the 853rd-century Metropolis). At this point, the time-traveling hero Chronos is heard in the background, gloating about having conned Savage in retaliation for a previous adventure when Savage had him stranded in time. ===Tartarus=== After being foiled or after defeating some thugs, Savage is known to return for bloodthirsty revenge. This time he had his eyes set on the Titans, a team he had nearly defeated before they ruined his plans for a nuclear assault. This time, Savage decided to form a team of his own. To do this, Savage kidnapped the Titans member known as Omen and forced her to recruit the perfect team for him using her mental powers. Though Omen did what Savage commanded, she secretly selected a team that would quickly fall apart. Recruiting Gorilla Grodd, Lady Vic, Cheshire, the Siren, and the Red Panzer, Savage formed the group Tartarus. Their first mission was to find the H.I.V.E. Mistress known as Adeline Wilson so that Savage could use her blood in an immortality serum. After slitting her throat, Savage and his team were confronted by the Titans. The Red Panzer died in the fight, but Savage and his remaining team managed to escape by shooting Cheshire and using her as a distraction, leaving her to be captured by the Titans. After learning the location of Omen, the Titans found her and engaged in another fight with Tartarus that quickly ended after the Siren switched sides. ===Villains United=== Vandal Savage was seen in the final two issues of Villains United. Originally, Savage was a member of Lex Luthor's Society, but he quit the Society and told Lex not to contact him for any reason after Luthor blew him off to welcome some less than competent new recruits. It is also plausible that Vandal quit because his daughter Scandal Savage was working against the Society as part of the Secret Six.Villains United #5 When the Society lodged a final ambush against the Six, Savage threatened to kill Luthor if he did not call off the attack, saying that he could not allow anyone to harm his daughter. This was shown to be due more to ulterior motives than fatherly love, as in issue #3 of the Secret Six miniseries, it was revealed Savage wants his daughter to produce an heir with Catman, and he has been putting bounties on the Secret Six's heads as a warning of what will happen to her lover, Knockout, if she refuses him.Villains United #6 He has, however, been seen as a member of the Society's second incarnation underneath Libra during the Final Crisis. He actually even serves as one of its inner cabinet members. ===The Flash and the JSA=== Savage was seen as leader of a doomsday cult. He attempted to use a device to pull an asteroid into Earth, but was thrown into space with the asteroid itself when the Flash reversed the polarity of the device.Flash (2nd series) Eventually, the asteroid fell back on Earth with Savage, who found his power greatly diminished and having lived through what he called the worst year of his life. His immortality completely drained, he is still able to survive otherwise fatal wounds, but a brain tumor and a strong decay of his biological function are leading him to a fast death, with an estimated life span of 11 days. Savage tries to capture Alan Scott by baiting him with a grotesque (and disguised) Wesley Dodds clone, who, in fact, is his own clone. After a failed attempt to steal Scott's DNA, Savage is left alone in the rubble of his former secret base. Realizing that his clone could be considered his own offspring, and that the blood of his descendants has always renewed his strength, Savage cooks and eats his clone, renewing his energies at least for another year.JSA: Classified #10–13 Savage returns in the first story arc of the new Justice Society of America, the mastermind behind a group of Neo-Nazi superpowered villains called the Fourth Reich, targeting the heirs of several Golden Age superhero bloodlines, in the belief that eliminating the bloodlines will eliminate the heroes' legacies and allow him to continue his goal of reshaping the world according to his own desires. He kills the Minute-Man, General Glory and Mister America, along with their families. The Fourth Reich kills nearly all of Commander Steel's Family. In issue #4, after a battle with Wildcat and his newly discovered son, who is revealed to have the ability to turn into a cat-like creature, at which Savage is surprised (which he claims to have not been in 116 years), Savage is defeated when hit by a fire truck. He later reappears in Atlantis where he is revealed to have been behind the atrocities in Sub Diego and Black Manta's occupation of the city.Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #54 ===Salvation Run=== Vandal Savage was one of the villains imprisoned on the \\"Hell Planet\\" of Salvation Run. He claims to have puzzled out the mechanical workings of the planet and used this knowledge to locate a \\"safe zone\\" without any of the predators that roam the rest of the world.Salvation Run #4 He intends to mate with the female supervillains in his group, and produce an immortal progeny. He has placated some of the more willful of the females (like Phobia and the Cheetah) by promising each of them that they will be his queen when he rules the planet. Ultimately, Savage escapes back to Earth, along with the rest of the imprisoned villains, following an attack by Parademons sent by DeSaad (who used the planet as a training ground). ===Final Crisis=== After returning to Earth, in Final Crisis Vandal Savage is placed on the new Society's inner circle by Libra. As he says to Lex Luthor, Vandal is willing to follow Libra in exchange for his heart's desire, an end to his boredom. In Final Crisis: Revelations, the Order of the Stone (the followers of Cain) comes in possession of the Spear of Destiny. Later, a group of followers led by Sister Wrack enter Vandal Savage's tent. They plunge the Spear of Destiny into Vandal's body. Thus Cain is reborn in him, and agrees to lead the Followers into punishing the Spectre for branding him because of his ancient crime.Final Crisis: Revelations #2 Using the Spear, Cain is able to separate the Spectre from his human host, and make him his slave.Final Crisis: Revelations #3 Cain's plans are undone by Renee Montoya, who manages to steal the Spear and reunite the Spectre with his host. The Spectre, forbidden by God to kill Cain, instead sentences him to walk the Earth, unable to disguise himself, being forever reviled and persecuted by the rest of the human race and denied rest until God says otherwise (the Mark of Cain).Final Crisis: Revelations #5 The superhero team known as the Outsiders come into conflict with a mysterious group calling themselves the Insiders, who are tracking down the fragments of the meteorite that granted Savage his immortality. It is ultimately revealed that the Insiders were members of Savage's tribe who were also exposed to the meteorite and gained immortality. Savage (still possessing the Mark of Cain) forms a temporary alliance with fellow immortal and cult leader (as well as at times Mass Murderer) Ra's al Ghul to thwart the group's plan. Whether true or not, Vandal Savage has come to believe he literally is the Biblical Cain. The mark he still bears hampers his ability to do his business and thus he attempts to pass it off—to either the Question or the Huntress. He succeeds, imparting the mark to the Question, who accepts to be branded to spare the Huntress from the disfigurement and the painDetective Comics #863 (despite the fact that the Question later proves how the brand could be suppressed by acknowledging the flaws, the shortcomings and the guilt of the bearer, a feat made seemingly impossible by Vandal Savage's mindset).Detective Comics Annual #12 (December 2010) ===Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne=== In the distant past, an amnesiac Bruce Wayne walks out of the cave where Anthro diedAs shown in Final Crisis\\" #7 (March 2009) and is discovered by a tribe of primitives led by Vandal Savage, who attempts to kill Wayne in the belief that he is a member of the \\"Sky People.\\" Savage holds Wayne hostage until a younger member of the tribe frees him and aids in his subsequent fight against Savage's mob.Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #1 In the 1800s, Vandal Savage, under the name of \\"Monsewer Sauvage\\" and currently weakened from a cancer in his intestines, wants Jonah Hex to eliminate the man who has been attacking his men, while Savage attempts to torture a woman whose family have been entrusted with a box, marked with the symbol of the bat, that they are to keep sealed until its owner comes to claim it. When he finds from the \\"doctor\\" torturing the girl how to open the box; Savage and the doctor escape in a carriage, with the girl and the box, while Batman is busy with Vandal's thugs. Batman catches up with the carriage which eventually falls into a nearby river. The doctor and Savage fall in but when they get out they come face to face with the Batman. Vandal, in an opium fueled delusion (which he took to control the pain from his cancer), sees Batman as an actual bat, compared to the girl and Alan Wayne (who had been on the way to kill himself when the carriage had careened into the river) whom he sees as skeletons, and remembers that night thousands of years ago when a bat-man had appeared. He is then knocked out by Batman.Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #4 ===The New 52=== In The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Vandal Savage is a supporting character in Demon Knights, a story based on Arthurian lore, co-starring with characters like Etrigan the Demon, Madame Xanadu, and the Shining Knight.Demon Knights #4 This story taking place in the Middle Ages, Savage is, at this point, traveling the world content to simply enjoy life, living for wine, women, and war.Demon Knights #16 He is a master tactician and incredibly strong, and uses his many skills that he has picked up over his long lifetime to aid his teammates.Demon Knights #1–26 An older Savage appears in DC Universe Presents, fashioned as a serial killer. He claims to be of ancient origin, his crimes sacrifices to forgotten gods. He has a daughter named Kassandra (a.k.a. Kass Sage), who is a police officer.DC Universe Presents #9 During the Trinity War storyline, Vandal Savage appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains. He assists Giganta and the Signalman into tracking Pandora. After Giganta was subdued, Vandal Savage steps in and the two fight, until Pandora seemingly kills him. However, Vandal Savage gets up and demands that Pandora give him the box, or else he will continue to try to find a way to kill her. To his surprise, Pandora willingly gives him the box, as she thinks she needs him to open it. Vandal Savage takes the box and fails to open it, with Pandora noting that he must have some good on his conscience.Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 A recent storyline where Superman loses his powers is revealed to be part of a complex plan by Vandal Savage to undermine the world's heroes before abducting several members of the Justice League, using them to power a machine that will draw in the asteroid that gave him his immortality while triggering that power in various modern descendants of his. Although Superman is able to regain his powers by subjecting himself to a dangerous form of 'chemotherapy', where he deliberately exposes himself to kryptonite to burn away what radiation was preventing his cells from absorbing sunlight,Superman vol. 3 #47 analysis reveals that Superman is now absorbing power from kryptonite that will soon kill him. Despite this, Superman refuses to give in, as various minor heroes assist him in confronting Savage's descendants before he takes Metallo's kryptonite heart (willingly donated) and charges into Savage's base.Superman vol. 3 #48 Although Savage is able to use the asteroid and the drained Justice League to charge his children's powers, when Savage shoots Superman with a toxic bullet, the toxins burn away the last of the radiation contaminating Superman's cells, allowing him to literally fall into the Fortress of Solitude—'stolen' by Vandal as part of his plans—and regain the last of his powers.Superman vol. 3 #49 Using his enhanced abilities, Savage attempts to win Superman's loyalty by revealing that the asteroid that empowered him could have hit Krypton before it was redirected to Earth, suggesting that a Kryptonian with his powers would have saved the planet, and then showing him a vision of a future where Savage rules the world with Superman as his general against enemy threats, but Superman rejects both of these visions as he genuinely doesn't believe that strength alone solves anything, working with Savage's son the Puzzler to push the asteroid back out of Earth's orbit.Superman vol. 3 #50 ===DC Rebirth=== After the events of DC Rebirth's No Justice, Vandal Savage is shown attempting to build a new Injustice Gang. His plans are thwarted by Lex Luthor, who arrives with his new Legion of Doom to mock Savage for knowing the truth about Perpetua but never trying to use her power. Savage tries to convince Lex not to pursue his course, but Lex defeats him in combat and beats him to death with a doorknob made from a piece of the Totality, the oldest energy source in existence, and one of the few things that could successfully kill him for good. His corpse was then seen held on Gorilla Grodd's shoulder.Justice League #1 (2018)( ==Powers and abilities== Since exposure to an unusual radiation generated by a crashed meteor, Savage has been functionally and biologically immortal, remaining unaged for over fifty thousand years. He was also endowed with meta- human regenerative capacities, although this ability is intermittently portrayed between allowing him to recover from any injuries sustained to just allowing him to survive anything that might kill him; he is even capable of getting drunk like any normal human. The radiation also enhanced Savage's strength, stamina, and speed, and enhanced his intellect to above average levels. Savage still feels pain, but over time, he has developed great endurance to it. His long lifespan has allowed him to gain a broad range of knowledge in a variety of fields, as well as granting him a great deal of influence over the world in general and the villain community in particular. Since a recent experience when he was trapped on an asteroid, Savage's immortality has been weakened, forcing him to cannibalize his own children and clones as a way of replenishing his energy. Recent stories have revealed that Savage was suffering from cancer when he acquired his immortality. As a result, while the cancerous cells in his body naturally cannot kill him, they cause him intermittent pain throughout his life, Savage being unable to have them removed as they are considered to be as much a part of his body as his healthy tissue. Vandal Savage is stated to be Cain, the first murderer, and as such, he may be as old as the entire human race. He briefly wore the Mark of Cain, a metaphysical scarring with a cross pattern disfiguring his face, until he passed it to Renee Montoya. Though the mark can be suppressed by willpower and by the recognition of one's shortcomings and flaws, Vandal Savage never realized it, instead trying to force the mark on other people. In the DCnU story line, it was revealed the irradiated meteor which gave Savage his immortality and augmented physicality was Kryptonian in origin. Im-El, an ancestor of Kal-El's, managed to avert a cataclysmic impact event by sending the asteroid towards prehistoric Earth. A fragment of the asteroid was what gave Savage his bolstered physique and immortality, also having the effect of bestowing on the progeny of his family line with odd powers and abilities included. The closer Savage's asteroid came to the planet, the more these powers would intensify, to the point that Savage was able to injure a weakened Superman. The extent of all these new abilities bestowed on him was not fully explored, as the comet was forced away before it could be explored in greater depth. ==Other versions Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty === Vandal Savage is the villain in the 1997 Elseworlds limited series Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty. In this story, Savage is obsessed with recovering the meteor that gave him his immortality, believing that it will reveal why he became what he has. Over the centuries, he finds himself opposing the members of the Wayne family, starting with medieval knight Sir Joshua of Wainwright, to contemporary Bruce Wayne (Vandal saved Bruce's parents from the mugging that killed them otherwise, but killed them when Bruce was an adult to ensure they did not stop him from reacquiring the meteor, only for him and Bruce to perish when they fell to Earth after a battle in space), to futuristic Vice President Brenda Wayne, admiring their spirit and strength of character even as he refuses to allow them to stop his efforts. At the conclusion of this last battle, Vandal is left drifting through space on the meteor, determined to learn the purpose of his life. ===Kingdom Come=== In the limited series Kingdom Come, Vandal Savage is a member of Lex Luthor's Mankind Liberation Front, but is captured by Batman and his allies when he is mauled by that timeline's version of Wildcat. In the novelization, Spectre expresses deep annoyance at the fact that Savage's immortality prevents him from administering justice on him. Savage, like Luthor, assists with victims of the nuclear fallout—in the additional epilogue, Batman praises Savage for his extensive healing experience. ===Star Trek/Legion of Super-Heroes=== Savage appears in the Star Trek/Legion of Super-Heroes crossover, co-published by DC Comics and IDW Publishing in 2011. In the 6 issue miniseries, the crew of the USS Enterprise join forces with the Legion of Super-Heroes after they are both accidentally thrown into an alternate timeline. In this timeline, Earth rules a galactic empire and is led by Vandal Savage. Kirk realizes Savage is also the mysterious immortal Flint. Savage/Flint had captured Q during a visit to the distant past and used his power to accelerate Earth's development and create an empire. While half of the group go back in time to discover when history diverged, the rest confront \\"Emperor Vandar the First\\" in the future. Vandar attempts to torture them with the goal of learning about the 'mistakes' in their histories so that he can 'correct' them in his timeline, but Kirk mockingly informs Vandar that his actions prove that he is nothing more than the caveman he was at the start, incapable of considering the idea that progress might be possible in any way other than beating his opponent to death. The alternate timeline is undone when Spock and Brainiac 5 release Q in the past; Q's escape undoes Vandar's changes and splits Vandal and Flint back into separate entities, Flint being a Vandal Savage who turned his life towards art and science rather than conquest. ===Flashpoint=== In the 1999 Elseworlds story \\"Flashpoint\\" (not to be confused with the 2011 crossover story arc of the same name), Savage runs a space-exploration corporation with the help of the crippled Barry Allen. He tries to use technology stolen from J'onn J'onzz to kill humanity (he wants to commit suicide in the grandest manner possible), but is killed by Barry Allen, who sacrifices his life to stop the alien device.Flashpoint #1–3 (Dec. 1999 – Feb. 2000) ===The Multiversity=== Another version of Savage, this one an interdimensional pirate, features in The Society of Superheroes #1, part of the Grant Morrison-written 2014 limited series The Multiversity. This Vandal Savage is a native of Earth-40, a world dominated by pulp-fiction villains. With a crew that includes versions of Lady Shiva and Blockbuster, he invades Earth-20, another pulp-inspired world with a cadre of heroes led by Doc Fate. Savage sets his sights on Immortal Man, needing to spill immortal blood to raise the demon Niczhuotan. Immortal Man overpowers Savage and it is Savage's own blood that is spilled. Although he dies, Savage's purpose has been fulfilled. ==Children== Being immortal has not stopped Vandal Savage from procreating. Scandal Savage is his daughter and the only one of his children he considers his heir. He has trained her in combat since she was a young child. Scandal is a member of the Secret Six and by her own admission is \\"damned hard to kill\\". The demon Grendel (from Beowulf) is also one of Vandal Savage's childrenSecret Six #14 claiming that Vandal Savage \\"mounted the cave beast of my mother\\". He refers to Vandal as \\"Cain\\", the first murderer. Another of his children is Cliff DeWitt, the owner of the Lab, the organization that gave Resurrection Man his powers. Within the New 52, he has another daughter named Kassidy Sage, DC Universe Presents #9 an FBI agent who reluctantly consults her imprisoned father on a case as well as the father of Angelo Bend. Bend was the US President's Chief of Staff and Vandal Savage supposedly killed him when he ripped out his tongue, but Angelo later appeared alive wearing the classic costume of the Angle Man. Aquaman #23.1: Black Manta ==In other mediaTelevision=== Animation * Vandal Savage is seen in several episodes of the animated series Justice League, voiced by Phil Morris. In this version, in addition to being an ageless immortal, Savage also has superhuman regenerative powers, allowing him to heal and regenerate any injuries instantly to leave no trace of damage. His origin is the same as that of his comic book counterpart, except, as revealed in the episode \\"Maid of Honor\\" that his age is half of that in the comics—25,000 years. He first appears in \\"The Savage Time\\", where Vandal's future self goes back in time and gives his past self technology to help the Germans win World War II. His plans are thwarted by the Justice League, along with the help of the Blackhawks and Easy Company. He next appears in \\"Maid of Honor\\", where he claims to be his own grandson and is betrothed to Princess Audrey in order to become the ruler of Kasnia, seeking command of a satellite rail gun before it is destroyed by the Justice League. The two-part episode \\"Hereafter\\" features a version of Savage from an alternate future, in which he succeeded in destroying all life on Earth. Having lived alone for 30,000 years, he regrets his earlier actions, going so far as deciding not to use a spaceship he'd built to leave Earth, instead opting to stay on the planet as a form of penance. Working with a time-displaced Superman, who had been seemingly killed by the Superman Revenge Squad a few months before Vandal destroyed humanity but had been sent to this future instead, Vandal is able to reset the timeline by sending the Man of Steel back to the 20th century via his new time machine. (He couldn't do this himself as the machine prevented him going back to a time where he already existed.) As a result of the timeline being reset and his destruction of life on Earth undone, the alternate future Vandal Savage quietly thanked his friend, Superman, before being erased from existence, finally at peace with his newfound redemption. * Vandal Savage appears in Young Justice, voiced by Miguel Ferrer in the first two seasons and David Kaye in season 3. He appears as member L-1 and head of \\"The Light\\" (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors). In \\"Evolution\\", it is revealed Vandal Savage was a prehistoric Cro-Magnon from Mongolia and gained three facial scars from the claws of a cave bear, prior to acquiring his powers of immortality and accelerated healing which helped him survive a fight with Neanderthals. He is also revealed to have been allies with Darkseid since when he was posing as Genghis Khan in the 13th century. Savage also posed as Blackbeard and Sun Tzu as well as Atilla, and also posed as Marduk when he led Babylon and foiled Starro during the 2nd millennium. He's also revealed to have spawned many children including Ishthur and Nabu from Babylon, two unnamed ones which used elements during the Mongol Empire, Cassandra (similar to her Legends of Tomorrow counterpart), and Olympia. He believes in the survival of the fittest and sees the Justice League's actions as keeping humanity from evolving. He shows a softer side. He shows sympathy for Black Manta when Aqualad was comatose, being able to relate from being a father himself. He shows affection to his children and is willing to guide them, as he told his daughter Cassandra how to use Warworld. He also shared a moment with his other daughter, Olympia before killing her as a show of mercy to prevent her from suffering further from Alzheimer's and told Cassandra to prepare a proper funeral for her. After being informed by the Ultra-Humanite in \\"Antisocial Pathologies\\" that Granny Goodness has discovered the Anti-Life Equation after she kidnapped Halo, Savage snaps a tablet he was holding in anger. In \\"Terminus\\", he goes to the Outsiders' base and informs them of Halo's whereabouts in exchange for one thing: they tell Granny who sent them after her. After Granny's plan is foiled, the Light has seemingly reconciled their partnership with Darkseid, though Vandal now secretly considers him a potential threat to be dealt with in time. He also vows to keep an eye on Halo as she could potentially help Darkseid & the Light if they need it. Live action * Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo had expressed interest in featuring Vandal Savage on the 1990 Flash TV show had the series been picked up for a second season. * During the season 7 episode of Smallville called \\"Cure\\", the character of Dr. Curtis Knox (portrayed by Dean Cain) is an immortal who has lived for centuries under various names, and has actually been historical figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Jack the Ripper, as well as being an apparent member of the Nazi Party. The character was originally referred to as Vandal Savage in the script, but the producers were told by the studio that they could not use that name. However, it is still implied that the character of Knox is just Vandal Savage using an alias. This notion is reinforced years later when the Vandal Savage character uses the alias Curtis Knox in an episode of Legends of Tomorrow. Casper Crump as Vandal Savage in the Arrow episode \\"Legends of Yesterday\\" * In the Arrowverse, Vandal Savage is portrayed by Casper Crump. This version of the villain has had his origin story combined with that of the character Hath-Set. Hath-Set is an Egyptian priest who kills Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara. The three are exposed to dark matter from meteorites, later revealed to originate from Thanagar, which grants Hath-Set immortality and Khufu and Chay-Ara the ability to reincarnate. For 4,000 years, as Vandal Savage, he kills each of Khufu and Chay-Ara's incarnations throughout history to retain his immortality. He serves as mentor to some of history's greatest conquerors and amasses a wealth of knowledge on many subjects. **Savage serves as the main antagonist of \\"Heroes Join Forces\\", the second annual crossover between The Flash and Arrow. He attempts to force the Flash and Green Arrow into handing over Khufu and Chay-Ara's current incarnations, Carter Hall and Kendra Saunders, by threatening to destroy Star City and Central City with the Staff of Horus. He succeeds, and most of the heroes and their teams die, but the Flash survives, travels back in time and warns Green Arrow. When the events play out the second time, the heroes defeat Savage, and he is reduced to ashes by the Staff. His ashes are later collected by Malcolm Merlyn, who claims that Savage now owes him a debt. **Savage returns as the main antagonist of the first season of Legends of Tomorrow. With Savage destined to conquer the world by around 2166, Time Master Rip Hunter assembles a team to track him through various points in history, ranging between the past and the future, attempting to limit his allies and eliminate his resources. Hunter reveals that Savage cannot be killed for good unless Hawkgirl delivers the killing blow with a dagger that Chay-Ara was holding at the moment of her first death. After the team have been chasing him around various periods of history trying to limit his powers, they learn that Savage is actually working with the other Time Masters who see him as the only one who can avert a Thanagarian invasion to occur after 2166. After the Legends destroy the Time Masters, Savage contacts two past versions of himself and looks to create a complex temporal paradox by detonating three Thanagarian meteorites in three different times. However, the radiation exposure renderes Savage mortal, leaving him and his past selves open to be killed by Rip and the team in the season finale. The team then destroy the meteorites, foiling Savage's plan. In season four, Savage appears in hell, where after apparently being assigned to torture Ray Palmer he has instead been befriended by him, having grown fond of the Legends after his death. ===Film=== * Vandal Savage appears as the main antagonist in the animated film Justice League: Doom with Phil Morris reprising his role from the Justice League animated series. His origins are mentioned to be the same as it is, with him receiving his superhuman intellect and immortality from radiation of a meteorite.... only it was set on Sumatra. * Vandal Savage appears in the animated film Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League – Cosmic Clash, voiced again by Phil Morris. After Brainiac scatters the Justice League across time, Batman and Flash use the cosmic treadmill to travel to the Stone Age to find Wonder Woman. That timeline's Vandal (who has not yet experienced the meteorite that gave him his intellect and immortality) enslaved several cavewomen in hopes of forming an empire with them, until Wonder Woman (who had her memories warped to stabilize the timeline) arrived to banish him and his male warriors. Vandal is then seen by Batman holding a cavewoman hostage. When Batman frees the hostage, she captures Vandal and Batman and takes them to Wonder Woman to be roasted in a pit of lava. Batman manages to free him and Vandal from the restraints and Vandal gets away. The present day Vandal can be seen along with Cheetah at the beginning of the film being arrested by the Justice League and forced into a police car. * Vandal Savage appears in Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay, voiced by Jim Pirri. His origins are mentioned to be the same as it is, with him receiving his superhuman intellect and immortality from radiation of a meteorite. It is also mentioned that he adopted the names of several conquerors in history such as Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and Genghis Khan. He is the father of Scandal Savage. It also appears that he holds no regard for his daughter's happiness, as he is evidenced by ordering his men to mortally shoot Scandal's lover, Knockout, and further wounded her himself when Scandal asked for his help in saving her. In the film, he pursues the \\"Get Out Of Hell Free\\" card, despite being immortal; so that he may be spared from damnation and spend his afterlife in Heaven. During the confrontation at his residence, the Suicide Squad questioned his desire for the card, stating that he was immortal and does not need it. Vandal later revealed that despite his immortality, he has had many near-death experiences within the last decade than ever over the millennia before, due to the existence of meta-humans. This led him to the logical conclusion that despite his immortality, death is inevitable; even for him. He has Professor Pyg surgically implant the card inside his body to prevent anyone from getting it, and positioning it in such a way that any attempts to get the card would instantly kill him, thus using up the card on him instantly. He is seemingly killed when Professor Zoom removes the card from his body by vibrating and phasing his hand through Savage's chest. ===Video games=== * Vandal Savage appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Brian Talbot. * Vandal Savage appears as a playable character in the DC TV Super-Villains DLC pack in Lego DC Super-Villains. ==References== Category:DC Comics metahumans Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Earth-Two Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional cannibals Category:Fictional characters with immortality Category:Fictional dictators Category:Fictional kings Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional cult leaders Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional prehistoric characters Category:Golden Age supervillains Category:Comics characters introduced in 1943 Category:Male characters in comics Category:DC Comics Nazis Category:DC Animated Universe characters ","title":"Vandal Savage"},{"id":"530173","text":"Mr. Flutesnoot is a fictional character from the Archie Comics books.

Toledo Bend Reservoir is a reservoir on the Sabine River between Texas and Louisiana. The lake has an area of 185,000 acres (749 km²), the largest man-made body of water in (or partially in) Louisiana, the largest in the South, and the fifth largest (surface acre) in the United States.North Toledo Bend The dam is capable of generating 92 megawatts of electrical power. The dam itself is located in the northeast corner of Newton County, Texas; however, that county includes very little of the reservoir, as most of it extends northward into parts of Sabine and DeSoto parishes in Louisiana, and Sabine, Shelby, and Panola counties in Texas. ==Historical development== The land along the Orange area often flooded from the Sabine, with destructive effects. Also, the considerations for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and recreational purposes were part of the reasons the Texas State Legislature formed the Sabine River Authority of Texas in 1949, and in 1950 the Louisiana State Legislature created the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana for the project.Toledo Bend Project With both authorities in agreement, in 1955 a feasibility report was initiated and by 1959, the two states allocated 30 million dollars for the project. The land was acquired in 1963, with the work following the subsequent year. The Massman-Johnson Construction Company served as the general contractor, and by the completion of the project in 1969, Texas’ estimated share of the funds was $70 million. The dam was built by the two states, without any assistance from the federal government.Toledo Bend Reservoir in East Texas Louisiana Director of Public Works Claude Kirkpatrick, who was also president of the Sabine River Authority of Louisiana at the time, pushed for the joint agreement with Texas, in the absence of federal funds, to make the project a reality. The Toledo Bend legislative bill was successfully pushed, despite numerous obstacles, by freshman Representative Cliff Ammons of Many, the seat of Sabine Parish. Funding came from Constitutional Amendment 8, which tapped previous funds for Civil War pensions into the specific reservoir project. Though Ammons became known as \\"the father of Toledo Bend,\\" voters defeated him in the 1964 state legislative election. ==History== Beginning in May 1963, land acquisitions for Toledo Bend Reservoir started as a joint management project of Texas and Louisiana River Authorities. Construction on the Toledo Bend Dam, spillway, and power plant, began on May 11, 1964. The closure section of the earthen embankment and impoundment of water was begun in October 1966. The power plant was completed and began operating in the early part of 1969. The Toledo Bend Project was constructed primarily for the purposes of water supply, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation. Toledo Bend Reservoir forms a portion of the boundary between the states of Texas and Louisiana. From the dam site, which is north of Burkeville, TX, the reservoir extends up the river for about to Logansport, LA, and inundates land in Sabine, Shelby, Panola, and Newton Counties, Texas, and Sabine and DeSoto Parishes, Louisiana. The water, normally covering an area of about 185,000 acres has a controlled storage capacity of . Toledo Bend is the nation's only public water conservation and hydroelectric power project to be undertaken without federal participation in its permanent financing. ==Public recreation== Toledo Bend, with its of shoreline, offers an almost unlimited opportunity for recreational development and is a major element in serving the growing demand for water oriented outdoor recreation. Both private and public facilities are available for swimming, boating, picnicking, fishing, camping, hunting, and sightseeing. The reservoir is a popular location for freshwater fishing with many clubs hosting tournaments. At present, the lake is best suited to shallow draft power boats due to a large number of trees and stumps that are still in the body of the lake. Although there are numerous well marked boat lanes that have been cleared of stumps and trees, one should use caution even on the boat lanes; one should use extreme caution when off the boat lanes and maintain a watch for stumps and/or trees as well as floating logs. ==See also== *Lawrence T.

The collection of teachings and practices that eventually came to be known as Mikkyō had its early beginnings in the esoteric traditions of India and China. As early as the 6th century, there had begun a major importation of spiritual and cultural ideas into Japan from China. However, in the early 9th century the formative concepts which would become the core of \\"mainstream\\" Mikkyo—Shingon and Tendai—were brought to Japan, initially by the monks Kūkai (the founder of Shingon) and Saichō (the founder of Tendai), both of whom had traveled to China to study. To these initial doctrines and beliefs were later added teachings concerning the powers of mysticism, magic and healing that had gradually begun to reach Japan with the arrival of itinerant monks, priests, hermits and shamanic practitioners, forced to flee from China after the fall of the Tang dynasty. Blending easily with elements of Shinto practice and the pre-Buddhist folk traditions of sangaku-shinkō (\\"spiritual practices connected with sacred mountains\\"), these imported teachings, combining Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, Onmyōdō, Taoism and, at a later date, Tibetan Buddhism, evolved to become the esoteric Japanese tradition that is Mikkyō. ==See also== *Godai (Japanese philosophy) ==References== Category:Japanese Buddhist terminology Category:Vajrayana ","title":"Mikkyō"},{"id":"530189","text":"Stewart Gilligan Griffin is a fictional character from the animated television series Family Guy. He is voiced by series creator Seth MacFarlane and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in a 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Stewie was created and designed by MacFarlane himself, who was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve, two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the greenlight, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". A highly precocious infant who talks and acts as an adult, Stewie began the series as a megalomaniacal sociopath, initially obsessed with violence, matricide and world domination. He is the youngest child of Peter and Lois Griffin, and the youngest brother of Meg and Chris. Over the duration of the series, particularly following the two episode arc \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" and \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\", the violent aspects of Stewie's personality were toned down, and he has evolved into an eccentric, friendly and flamboyant scamp (something possibly foreshadowed in the direct- to-video film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story). He has also come to have a very close friendship with the family's anthropomorphic dog, Brian (whom he originally used to antagonize in the earliest episodes). Stewie is considered to be the show's breakout character and has received numerous award accommodations from writers such as Jodiss Pierre. Wizard magazine rated him the 95th-greatest villain of all time. ==Role in Family Guy== Stewie is a one- year-old prodigy who has a very sophisticated psyche and is able to speak very fluently in an upper-class English accent with quite advanced vocabulary. He reaches his first birthday in the season 1 episode \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\", and has not been referred to as being more than a year old since, despite being seen in many episodes attending pre-school. Highly literate and able to cite pop culture references that long predate his birth, Stewie is also entranced by Raffi and Teletubbies. Stewie succumbs to other childish tendencies; he believes Peter has truly disappeared in a game of Peekaboo, often has difficulties understanding the concept of shapes, talks to his teddy bear Rupert as if he were alive, is overcome with laughter when Lois blows on his stomach; and has no idea how to use a toilet. MacFarlane has stated that Stewie is meant to represent the general helplessness of an infant through the eyes of an adult. Per cartoon physics, his ability to move objects of greater weight than himself is not surprising to other characters, nor is his ability to retrieve firearms from hammerspace or his ability to talk. According to \\"Don't Be a Dickens at Christmas\\", he understands German (but cannot speak it), as his mother is of German descent and the Pewterschmidts (except Lois) speak it. Stewie's mastery of physics and mechanical engineering are at a level of science fiction. He has constructed advanced fighter-jets, mind control devices, a weather control device, a teleportation device, robots, clones, a working Transporter device from Star Trek, time machines, a Multiverse Transporter, a shrinking pod, as well as an assortment of weapons including lasers, rocket launchers, and crossbows. Stewie employs these to cope with the stresses of infant life (such as teething pain, and eating broccoli) and to murder his mother, Lois, with mixed success at best depending on the objective. As made clear in the pilot episode, Stewie's matricidal tendencies are a result of Lois constantly (and unwittingly) thwarting his schemes, and so he desires to kill her to carry out his plans without her interference. In other, later episodes, Stewie engages in other violent or criminal acts, including robbery, aggravated assault, carjacking, loan sharking, forgery, and killing off many minor characters (with a tank, guns, and other assorted weaponry). Stewie eventually realizes his dreams of matricide and world domination in the sixth season two-part episode \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" and \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\". The events are reverted in a deus ex machina ending, where most of the story turns out to be a computer simulation. Because of the rather disastrous ending for himself in the simulation, being shot and killed by Peter, he decides to put aside his plans of matricide and world domination for the time being. Stewie shows a complete disdain for most people, but does show affection and even rare instances of kindness to his family. Such moments include his support for Meg (whom he traditionally calls \\"Megan\\") as when he chided Brian's coke-induced hostility to her (\\"The Thin White Line\\"), retracted his joke, \\"I hate you too, bitch\\" when Meg said \\"I hate you all\\" to the family (\\"Untitled Griffin Family History\\"), and wiped her tears during a weepy moment. On a more frequent basis though, Stewie constantly disrespects Meg, as he does with most elders (and as most people do to Meg), often being rude to her and subjecting her to the malice of his misbehavior, once even tricking her outside to be attacked by bees on steroids. He generally thinks of Peter as an inferior—regarding him simply as \\"the fat man\\" and, at one point, harboring doubts that Peter could possibly be his father (\\"Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story\\")—but does bond with him over a shared love of practical jokes made at Lois' expense (\\"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\\"). While Stewie generally regards Chris as a stooge, he considers him his only friend aside from Brian, and even helped Chris to dress when he felt too shy to date (\\"Extra Large Medium\\") and assists him in dealing with bullies (\\"Secondhand Spoke\\"). In a few episodes, such as \\"Stewie Loves Lois\\", it is shown that Stewie can love his mother. In that episode, after Lois recovers and repairs a lost Rupert and serves Stewie a meal he likes, he rethinks Lois and accepts her as a loving mother. When he becomes too dependent on her, she deliberately takes no notice of him; when he hurts himself, she tries to show notice of him again, he returns to hating her. However, at the end of the season nine premiere, \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\", when Diane Simmons is about to murder Lois for uncovering her murderous revenge scheme, Stewie secretly saves Lois by killing Diane with a sniper rifle, though he states to himself that he only did it to not miss out on the opportunity to kill Lois in the future. In the more recent seasons, Stewie has a larger amount of freedom from his parents, usually spending much of his time with Brian. This extends to the point of him being able to keep pigs from parallel universes (\\"Road to the Multiverse\\") or take part in the television series Jolly Farm (\\"Go Stewie Go\\"), as compared to the first season, in which his plans were constantly hindered by Lois. In \\"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair\\", Stewie inadvertently clones an evil twin of himself after trying to increase his evil nature. By the end of the episode, it is suggested that the original Stewie may have been unknowingly killed by Brian (as he cannot tell them apart) and Stewie turns to the camera with glowing yellow eyes (reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\"). But so far, the Stewie recently seen in \\"Trading Places\\", the follow-up episode, he still seems to have his mostly harmless eccentricity, shown when he asks Brian if he wants to trade places with him for fun. He also starts to interact with more people despite still having hatred towards many of them, as shown in cutaways in later episodes, and more flamboyant. Stewie is shown in more recent episodes to be a superfan of Taylor Swift, and even sets her up with Chris as a prom date. Stewie has had a few rare interactions with his pedophile neighbor Herbert. Stewie intensely dislikes him and is one of the few characters fully aware of Herbert's nature, even calling him a pervert to his face. All this does, however, is move Herbert into thinking Stewie as \\"feisty\\". In \\"Dog Bites Bear\\", Stewie ranks the films in The Fast and the Furious franchise as follows. # Fast & Furious 6 # Fast Five # Furious 7 # The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (which he says is controversial) # The Fast and the Furious # Fast and Furious # 2 Fast 2 Furious This is exactly how writer Cherry Chevapravatdumrong ranks the franchise. In the season 16 episode \\"Send in Stewie, Please\\", it is revealed that Stewie's English accent is fake and that he actually has an American Boston accent, although the follow up joke that has him speak in numerous other voices (of Seth MacFarlane's other characters) suggest it was a mere gag. ==Development== Seth MacFarlane created and voices Stewie Stewie's voice is provided by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, who also provides the voices of Brian Griffin, Peter Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire as well as numerous other characters. MacFarlane based Stewie's accent on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, particularly on Harrison's performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. MacFarlane has stated that his inspiration for the Stewie name was a car owned by Stan Lee. MacFarlane has also linked Stewie with David Hyde Pierce on more than one occasion, saying he wants Pierce to play Stewie if a live action version of the show would ever be created. Stewie's head has the shape of a rugby ball. In the episode \\"Stuck Together, Torn Apart\\", a cutaway shows Stewie's head to be normally shaped, until he hits it on the ceiling while bouncing on the bed, and it is elongated into the familiar shape. Flashbacks in \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\", however, show his head was already shaped like a football when he was born. ===Ambiguous sexuality=== Stewie's sexuality is ambiguous. When the writers began to flesh out Stewie's character beyond being a generic supervillain in season two, MacFarlane and the writers began to explore Stewie's sexuality with a series of one-off gags, which hinted in \\"Chick Cancer\\" and \\"We Love You, Conrad\\" that Stewie could be gay. One example is in the episode, \\"Brian and Stewie,\\" where Stewie's cellphone screensaver is of a muscular man. Another is where he has a picture of Chris Noth in his wallet and he expresses his wishes to have sexual relations with Brian's son, Dylan. In some episodes, such as \\"Turkey Guys\\" and \\"Send in Stewie, Please\\", Stewie appears to be on the verge of coming out of the closet when he is interrupted for comedic effect. On other occasions, such as when Stewie falls in love with a girl, Janet, in \\"Dammit Janet!\\", he has been shown to be straight. In the commentary for Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, the writers describe how they were going to make Stewie discover he was gay, but decided to scrap this idea in order to retain Stewie's sexual ambiguity for writing purposes. MacFarlane planned for the series' third season to end with Stewie coming out after a near-death experience. The show's abrupt cancellation caused MacFarlane to abort these plans, and the episode \\"Queer Is Stewie?\\" was actually produced, but never shown. Since that point, MacFarlane has opted to have Stewie portrayed as sexually ambiguous, as, in his eyes, the flexibility of Stewie's sexuality allows for much more freedom in terms of writing for the character. MacFarlane later elaborated: When asked why he made the decision \\"to take Stewie from homicidal maniac to gay little song boy?,\\" MacFarlane answered: \\"It wasn't a conscious decision. Characters evolve in certain ways and we found that doing the take-over-the-world thing every week was getting played out and was starting to feel a little dated. It was weirdly feeling a little '90s and believe me, if we were still doing that, the show would be on its last legs. I only half-jokingly go by the guideline that, if it's something that might possibly ruin the show, it's a story we should probably do.\\"Sovo.com MacFarlane told Playboy \\"We had an episode that went all the way to the script phase in which Stewie does come out. It had to do with the harassment he took from other kids at school. He ends up going back in time to prevent a passage in Leviticus from being written: 'Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind. It is an abomination.' But we decided it's better to keep it vague, which makes more sense because he's a one-year-old. Ultimately, Stewie will be gay or a very unhappy repressed heterosexual. It also explains why he's so hellbent on killing his mother, Lois and taking over the world: he has a lot of aggression, which comes from confusion and uncertainty about his orientation.\\" ==Reception== MacFarlane has been nominated for two awards for voicing Stewie Griffin. In 1999, he won a Primetime Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Voice-Over Performance. In 2006, he received an Annie Award in the Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television, Production category, for his voice work in the episode \\"Brian the Bachelor\\". In addition, Wizard magazine rated Stewie the 95th-greatest villain of all time. Stewie was also named the best Family Guy character on a list of \\"Top 25 Family Guy Characters\\" compiled by IGN. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly placed him 45th on its list of the \\"Top 100 Characters of the Past Twenty Years.\\" Gay.com ranked Stewie as the fifteenth-gayest cartoon character. Hal Boedeker, a critic for The Orlando Sentinel, called Stewie \\"a brilliant creation\\". Stewie (and Brian) usually form the center-plot for the show's highest-rated and most critically acclaimed episodes, these being the Road to ... episodes. In a list of Stewie and Brian's greatest adventures, five of the Road to ... episodes occupied the top five places. ===Allegations of plagiarized design=== Several commentators, including its author Chris Ware, have noticed similarities between the title character of the graphic novel Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth (first published in 1995) and Stewie. Ware has remarked that the similarities are \\"a little too coincidental to be simply, well, coincidental.\\" He further stated, \\"I don't want a book of seven years' worth of my stuff to become available and then be accused of being a rip-off of Family Guy.\\" 20th Century Fox insists that Stewie is an entirely original character. In a 2003 interview, MacFarlane said that he had never seen the comic strip before, described the similarities as \\"pretty shocking\\" and said that he could see how Ware would reach that conclusion.\\" ==Merchandise and appearances in other media== Stewie has been included on Family Guy T-shirts, baseball caps, bumper stickers, cardboard standups, refrigerator magnets, posters, and several other items. Stewie appears in the Family Guy Video Game!,2K Announces Voice Talent for Family Guy Video Game; Will the Real Baby Stewie Please Stand up!; Family Guy Show Creator Seth MacFarlane and the Main Cast Sign on with 2K to do Voice Over Roles for the Upcoming Family Guy Video Game. where Stewie discovers his brother Bertram attempting to outdo him in taking over the world. Desperate to stop him, Stewie shrinks himself and makes his way to Bertram's lair within Peter's testicles to discover his plan, destroys his henchman cloning lab, and rescues a kidnapped Rupert from a rocket. He finally confronts Bertram in the park, where Bertram turns himself into a giant. Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story is a DVD movie about Stewie's secret and what can possibly be his future. Stewie is also a playable character (along with Brian) in the show's second video game, Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse, where the pair travel through the multiverse again, in order to defeat Bertram. Stewie appeared in Bones, eventually revealed to be the result of FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth's (David Boreanaz) brain tumor. Seth MacFarlane wrote all of Stewie's dialog for the episode. The character appeared in a Coca-ColaClipta.com commercial during Super Bowl XLII, he and Brian appeared in a commercial for Wheat Thins, he presented a musical number at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards with Brian, and he appeared at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.Livevideo.com He appeared on the December 21, 2009 episode of Late Show with David Letterman to present \\"Top Ten Things You Don't Want To Hear From Your Child.\\" ==Understanding Stewie== There is much debate over which characters in Family Guy can understand Stewie. In an interview, MacFarlane said that everyone can basically understand him, but they ignore him or just think to themselves \\"oh how cute\\" when he talks. However, at the 2011 Comic-Con panel, he compared this to Wile E. Coyote in the old Merrie Melodies cartoons. MacFarlane went on to say that Brian always hears Stewie, and more recently so does Chris, but the writers usually strive for Peter, Lois, and Meg (apart from Leggo My Meg-O) not to hear him. Once Stewie leaves the house, the question of who can hear him depends very much on the story. MacFarlane also states that these rules can be broken for the sake of comedy, so this could change from one episode to another. In \\"Inside Family Guy\\", Peter apologizes to the family, to which Stewie comments: \\"Oh that's nice of you to say\\". Peter replies: \\"Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand\\", referring to the ongoing discussion whether or not family members, other than Brian, are able to understand him. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * ==External links== * Stewie Griffin at Fox.com Category:Animated human characters Category:Child characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional characters from Rhode Island Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional bullies Category:Fictional fratricides Category:Fictional infants Category:Fictional inventors Category:Fictional mad scientists Category:LGBT characters in animation Category:Male characters in animation Category:American male characters in television Category:Time travelers Category:Family Guy characters Category:Fictional victims of child abuse ","title":"Stewie Griffin"},{"id":"530191","text":"Pietro II Orseolo (961 − 1009) was the Doge of Venice from 991 to 1009. He began the period of eastern expansion of Venice that lasted for the better part of 500 years. He secured his influence in the Dalmatian Romanized settlements from the Croats and Narentines, freed Venetia from a 50-year-old taxation to the latter, and started Venetia's expansions by conquering the islands of Lastovo (Lagosta) and Korčula (Curzola) and acquiring Dubrovnik (Ragusa). ==Reign Relations with Byzantium === In 992 Pietro II Orseolo concluded a treaty with the Byzantine emperor Basil II to transport Byzantine troops in exchange for commercial privileges in Constantinople.J. Norwich, Byzantium: The Apogee, 257 His dogaressa was Maria Candiano.https://archive.org/stream/dogaressasofveni00stal#page/314/mode/2up Following repeated complaints by the Dalmatian city-states in 997, the Venetian fleet under Orseolo attacked the Neretvian pirates of Neretva on Ascension Day in 998. Pietro then took the title of Dux Dalmatianorum (Duke of the Dalmatians), associating it with his son Giovanni Orseolo. === Scorched earth policy === On 9 May 1000 Doge Pietro II decided to finally pacify the Croatians and the Narentines during the last Croatian-Bulgarian wars, protecting Venetian trade colonies and the interests of Romanized Dalmatians. Without difficulties, his fleet of six ships scorched the entire eastern half of the Adriatic coast, with only the Neretvians offering resistance. After the Neretvians stole goods and captured forty tradars from Zadar, the Doge dispatched ten ships that caught the Neretvians near the island of Kača. He captured them all and brought them triumphantly to Split. There, Neretvian emissaries requested the release of the prisoners. Pietro II agreed provided that the Neretvian Archont himself agreed to bow before him. Moreover, the Neretvians would also have to renounce the old tax that Venetia had to pay since 948, and guarantee safe passage to Venetian ships in the Adriatic. Pietro II released all prisoners except for six Narentines, whom he kept as hostages. The mainland Narentines were thus pacified; the citizens of Korčula decided to wage war against Orseolo, but were eventually conquered. Lastovo however, continued to resist Venetian incursions. The island was infamous for being a pirate haven. In the effort to decisively quell further opposition, Pietro II ordered the evacuation of the island city. Despite continuing opposition, he eventually razed Lastovo to the ground. At the same time that Pietro II subjugated Lastovo, the former Croatian king Svetoslav Suronja fled to Venice after being deposed by his two brothers. To bolster his weakened position, King Stephen I of Croatia married Pietro II Orseolo's daughter, Joscella (Hicela) Orseolo. Their son Peter Krešimir IV became king in Croatia in 1059. Pietro II Orseolo was married to Maria Candiano, the daughter of Vitale Candiano and niece of Doge Pietro IV Candiano. Staley, Edgcumbe: The dogaressas of Venice : The wives of the doges. London : T.

It existed from July 9, 1832, to August 5, 1835. Described as \\"Indian Stream Territory, so-called\\" by the United States census-taker in 1830, the area was named for Indian Stream, a small watercourse. It had an organized elected government and constitution and served about three hundred citizens. ==History== The area was first settled by Europeans under a land grant, not from the King of Great Britain, but from a St. Francis Indian named King Philip, after Metacomet, who was also called King Philip. This grant was sold to one land-speculation company, while a second group of Indians from the same tribe made representations to another company of Europeans that their chief had been deposed and that they were empowered to issue a grant to the second company. Following the Revolutionary War, both companies surveyed the territories and issued their own land grants to settlers, which frequently overlapped one another. After the War of 1812, when both companies were in financial straits, they merged and reconciled all land claims. The establishment of Indian Stream as an independent nation was, essentially, the result of the ambiguous boundary between the United States and British Lower Canada as defined in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. There were three possible interpretations of where \\"the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut River\\" might be. As a result, the area in and around the three tributaries that fed into the head of the Connecticut River was not definitively under the jurisdiction of either the United States or Lower Canada (which was formed in 1791). The relevant text from the treaty reads:Treaty of Paris (1783) on Wikisource The Republic encompassed the northern reaches of what is now the state of New Hampshire, including the four Connecticut Lakes. While the British claimed the southeasternmost branch (the chain of Connecticut Lakes), the U.S. claimed the border as it is today (i.e., Halls Stream to the west, which is, arguably, the \\"northwesternmost headwater\\" of the Connecticut). Both sides sent in tax collectors and debt-collecting sheriffs. The double taxation angered the population, and the Republic was formed to put an end to the issue until such time as the United States and Great Britain could reach a settlement on the boundary line. Some of the citizenry considered Indian Stream to be part of the U.S. but not a part of New Hampshire. The Indian Stream assembly declared independence on July 9, 1832, and produced a constitution. One of the drafters of the constitution was Luther Parker, who served as justice of the peace for the Republic from 1832 to 1835. The Constitution of Indian Stream states in \\"Part Second - Form of Government\\": Marker for the Indian Stream Republic, erected by the Pittsburg Historical Society along U.S. Route 3 Detail of stele for Luther Parker located in the Pittsburg town park New Hampshire historical marker (number 1) for the Republic of Indian Stream in Pittsburg The independence declaration did not cause the sheriff of Coos County to cease his involvement in affairs, with later events leading to an impending invasion by New Hampshire. On July 30, 1835, this sheriff asked for the militia. Two companies of infantry from the towns around Colebrook met at Stewartstown, ready to march into the disputed territory. The sheriff preceded them and, on August 4, met with between 30 and 40 members of the assembly, to whom he issued an ultimatum. Threatened with forcible occupation, most of the gathered assembly capitulated and relented to being annexed by New Hampshire. The Republic ceased to operate independently the next day when five leaders of Indian Stream wrote to a British official in Sherbrooke, Lower Canada, that, with a response to their petition for protection by the British not having occurred in time, Indian Stream had agreed to annexation by New Hampshire. One of the \\"Streamers\\", Richard I. Blanchard, agreed to serve as a deputy sheriff of Coos County. The militia stayed in Stewartstown and dispersed to their homes on August 6. The annexation of Indian Stream by New Hampshire did not resolve the land dispute. Local British officials took a dim view of the annexation. An incident soon tested the situation. In October 1835, Blanchard led a small party to arrest John Tyler for an unpaid hardware-store debt. After the arrest, Tyler was freed on the road back to Coos County by a group of his neighbors. In reporting the incident to the British magistrate, Tyler falsely stated under oath that the location of his arrest was Drayton, Lower Canada. The magistrate then issued a warrant for Blanchard's arrest, which was carried out by a deputy and a few members of the British faction of Streamers, who returned with Blanchard toward the magistrate's house in Lower Canada. Along the way, a group of Streamers stopped them in the road, rescued Blanchard and returned with their freed comrade to Indian Stream. The deputy's party continued on to the magistrate's house. Several hours later, there was a commotion in the road nearby from a posse of armed Streamers, emboldened by liquor, bent on making an impression. The invading posse shot the deputy through the thigh and then captured the hobbled magistrate with a blow of a saber to his scalp during a struggle. They returned to Canaan, Vermont, with the bleeding magistrate as prisoner, where local leaders treated his wound and released him immediately. In the aftermath, a detachment of fifty New Hampshire militia, including troops and officers, occupied the territory from mid-November until February 18, 1836. On April 2, 1836, a resolution \\"that New Hampshire has a right to exercise an unconditional control over the territory of Indian Stream\\" was approved by the citizens of Indian Stream. This international incident caused a diplomatic crisis. The British ambassador to the United States protested to President Andrew Jackson and the Secretary of State. Both governments, appalled at the idea of war over a matter so trivial as a hardware-store debt, determined to take measures so that matters did not escalate, and an uneasy peace endured in the years preceding the conclusion of a treaty settling the border. In July 1837, Lord Palmerston in London dismissed all charges in the British judiciary system arising from the incident and reiterated the British position that the territory was part of British North America. The area was still described as Indian Stream at the time of the U.S. census taken on June 1, 1840, when the local population totalled 315. Upon petition by the residents, the area was incorporated as the town of Pittsburg in 1840. In 1842, the land dispute was definitively resolved by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, and the land was assigned to New Hampshire.

This route from Europe to Asia is shorter than the traditional one around Africa, and cheaper than the one via the Suez Canal. In December 2014, a breach near the southern end of the pipeline led to a massive oil spill into the Evrona Nature Reserve.

World War II raged early in the decade, and just like baseballers, many popular boxers went overseas to fight for their countries, Joe Louis, Billy Conn, Beau Jack, and Bob Montgomery among them. Louis was used to entice Americans to join the war against Germany, a couple of propaganda movies starring Louis and many propaganda posters being produced. The posters in particular are collectors' items today. Louis' great rival, Max Schmeling, a lifelong opponent of the Nazi regime, was forced by Adolf Hitler to join the German military after his loss to Louis at their 1938 rematch. Because of the war many world championship divisions were frozen. Sometimes, a title bout was held five years after the last title bout in that division had been held. Television was in its infancy in the 1940s, but nonetheless, viewers were treated to many 10-round, non-title fights, and many crown challengers became household names under the absence of so many world champions. The 1940s did have some historic world title fights and rivalries. Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta began their series of famous bouts towards the middle of the decade, Jack and Montgomery fought four times, and Rocky Graziano and Tony Zale starred in what boxing critics have often called one of the fiercest rivalries in boxing history. The heavyweight division was dominated by Louis, the only man in history to be world champion throughout every year of a decade. He became world champion in 1937 and kept the title until 1949. LaMotta lost a highly controversial fight to Billy Fox in 1947. LaMotta later testified he threw the fight to earn a title shot at world middleweight champion Marcel Cerdan, ==1941== *January 13 – Anton Christoforidis becomes the first Greek world boxing champion in history, beating Melio Bettina by a fifteen-round decision for the National Boxing Association's vacant world Light-Heavyweight title, in Cleveland. *January 17 – Fritzie Zivic retains his world Welterweight title with a twelfth-round knockout of Henry Armstrong at their New York City rematch. *May 22 – Gus Lesvenich wins the world Light-Heavyweight title, with a fifteen-round decision over Anton Christoforidis, at New York. *May 23 – In an extremely controversial bout, Joe Louis retains his world Heavyweight title with a seventh round disqualification win over Max Baer's brother, Buddy Baer.

This value can be calculated and compared with different grades of coal and other combustible materials, which produce different amounts of heat according to their grade. While chemistry provides ways of calculating the heating value of a certain amount of a substance, there is a difference between this theoretical value and its application to real coal. The grade of a sample of coal does not precisely define its chemical composition, so calculating the coal's actual usefulness as a fuel requires determining its proximate and ultimate analysis (see \\"Chemical Composition\\" below). ==Chemical composition== Chemical composition of the coal is defined in terms of its proximate and ultimate (elemental) analyses. The parameters of proximate analysis are moisture, volatile matter, ash, and fixed carbon. Elemental or ultimate analysis encompasses the quantitative determination of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen within the coal. Additionally, specific physical and mechanical properties of coal and particular carbonization properties The calorific value 'Q' of coal [kJ/kg] is the heat liberated by its complete combustion with oxygen. Q is a complex function of the elemental composition of the coal. Q can be determined experimentally using calorimeters. Dulong suggests the following approximate formula for Q when the oxygen content is less than 10%: :Q = 337C + 1442(H - O/8) + 93S, where C is the mass percent of carbon, H is the mass percent of hydrogen, O is the mass percent of oxygen, and S is the mass percent of sulfur in the coal.

The tallest peak is the Jade Emperor Peak (), which is commonly reported as being tall, but is officially described by the PRC government as tall.China Announced Elevation of 19 Well-known Mountains , China Institute of Geo-Environment Monitoring, 19 May 2007. Accessed 4 June 2007. Mount Tai is known as the eastern mountain of the Five Great Mountains of China. It is associated with sunrise, birth, and renewal, and is often regarded the foremost of the five. Mount Tai has been a place of worship for at least 3,000 years and served as one of the most important ceremonial centers of China during large portions of this period. ==Location== Jade Emperor Peak, the summit of Mount Tai Mount Tai is located in western Shandong, just north of the city of Tai'an and to the south of the provincial capital Jinan. It extends from above sea level and covers an area of at its base. The Jade Emperor Peak, which rises } above sea level, is located at 36° 16′N and 117° 6′E. ==History== Traces of human presence at Mount Tai date back to the Paleolithic period. Evidence of human settlement of the area can be proven from the neolithic period onwards. During this time, two cultures had emerged near the mountain, the Dawenkou culture to the south and the Longshan culture to the north. During the Xia Dynasty (c. 2070-1600 ) the mountain was known as Mount Dai () and lay within the borders of Qingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. Religious worship of Mount Tai has a tradition dating back 3,000 years, from the time of the Shang (c. 1600-1046 ) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). Over time, this worship evolved into the Feng and Shan sacrifices. The sacrifices were an official imperial rite and Mount Tai became one of the principal places where the emperor would carry out the sacrifices to pay homage to heaven (on the summit) and earth (at the foot of the mountain) in the Feng () and Shan () sacrifices respectively. The two sacrifices are often referred to together as the Fengshan sacrifices (). Carving of an inscription as part of the sacrifices marked the attainment of the \\"great peace\\". By the time of the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046-256 ) sacrifices at Mount Tai had become highly ritualized ceremonies in which a local feudal lord would travel there to make sacrifices of food and jade ritual items. These would then be arranged in a ritually correct pattern before being buried on the mountain. In the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 ) the vassal states of Qi and Lu bordered Mount Tai to the north and south respectively, from where their feudal lords both made independent sacrifices on Mount Tai. According to Zhou ritual belief, the spirit of Mount Tai would only accept sacrifices offered by a feudal lord, leading Confucius (in his Analects 3.6) to criticize the ministers who offered state sacrifices here after usurping power.Slingerland, Edward G. (Trans. & Ed.). Confucius Analects: With Selections from Traditional Commentaries. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett. 2003. . Retrieved November 17, 2012. p.19. In the ensuing Warring States period (475-221 ), to protect itself against invasion, the State of Qi erected a -long wall, the ruins of which are still present today. The name Tai'an of the neighboring city is attributed to the saying \\"If Mount Tai is stable, so is the entire country\\" (both characters of Tai'an, \\"泰\\" and \\"安\\", have the independent meaning of \\"peace\\"). In 219 , Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China, held a ceremony on the summit and proclaimed the unity of his empire in a well-known inscription. During the Han Dynasty (206 -220 ), the Feng and Shan sacrifices were considered the highest of all sacrifices. Rituals and sacrifices were conducted by the Sui. Japan, India, the Persian court in exile, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, the Turks, Khotan, the Khmer, and the Umayyad Caliphate all had representatives attending the Feng and Shan sacrifices held by Emperor Gaozong of Tang in 666 at Mount Tai.Skaff 2012, pp. 146-7. Mount Tai has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987. In 2003, it attracted around six million visitors. A renovation project was completed in late October 2005, which aimed at restoring cultural relics and renovating damaged buildings of cultural significance. Widely known for its special ceremonies and sacrifices, Mount Tai has seen visits by many poets and literary scholars who have traveled there to gain inspiration. There are grandiose temples, many stone inscriptions and stone tablets with the mountain playing an important role in the development of both Buddhism and Taoism.tai mountain ==Natural significance== The Immortal Bridge (), a natural landscape Mount Tai is a tilted fault-block mountain with height increasing from the north to the south. It is the oldest example of a paleo-metamorphic formation from the Cambrian Period in eastern China. Known as the Taishan Complex, this formation contains magnetized, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock as well as intrusions of other origins during the Archean Era. The uplift of the region started in the Proterozoic Era; by the end of the Proterozoic, it had become part of the continent. Besides the Jade Emperor Peak, other distinctive rock formations are the Heaven Candle Peak, the Fan Cliff, and the Rear Rock Basin. Mount Tai lies in the zone of oriental deciduous forest; about 80% of its area is covered with vegetation. The flora is known to comprise almost 1,000 species. Some of the trees in the area are very old and have cultural significance, such as the Han Dynasty Cypresses, which were planted by the Emperor Wu Di, the Tang Chinese Scholartree (about 1,300 years old), the Welcoming-Guest Pine (500 years old) and the Fifth-Rank Pine, which was named originally by the Emperor Qin Shi Huang, but was replanted about 250 years ago. ===Physical features=== Mount Tai rises abruptly from the vast plain of central Shandong, and is naturally endowed with many scenic sites. Geologically, it is a tilted fault-block mountain, higher to the south than north, and is the oldest and most important example of the paleo-metamorphic system representative of the Cambrian Period in eastern China. Referred to as the Taishan Complex, it comprises magnetized, metamorphic, sedimentary rock and an intrusive mass of various origins that were formed in the Archean Era 1700-2000 million years ago. Subsequently, in the Proterozoic Era, the Taishan region began to rise, becoming part of the continent by the end of the era. Uplift continued until the middle of the Cenozoic Era. The gneiss which emerged in the Taishan region is the foundation for all of North China. Cambrian strata, fully emerged in the north, are rich in fossils. Six streams flow from the summit, their water renowned for its extremely low mineral content, slight acidity (pH = 6.3) and relatively high oxygen content (6.4 milligrams per liter (mg/l)). ===Climate=== The area falls within the warm temperate climatic zone. Meteorological data is not available. The regular climate is molly to -2 degrees Celsius. ===Vegetation=== Vegetation covers 79.9% of the area, which is densely wooded, but information about its composition is lacking. The flora is diverse and known to comprise 989 species, of which 433 species are woody and the rest herbaceous. Medicinal plants total 462 species and include multiflower knotweed, Taishan ginseng, Chinese gromwell and sealwort, which are renowned throughout the country. Some trees are very old and famous, notably the Han Dynasty Cypresses (planted 2,100 years ago by Emperor Wu Di of the Han Dynasty), 'Welcoming Guest Pine' (500 years old) and 'Fifth Rank Pine' (named by Emperor Qin Shi Huang of the Qin Dynasty). ===Fauna=== There are over 200 species of animals in addition to 122 species of birds, but precise details are lacking. Large-scaled fish Varicorhinus macrolepis is found in running water at 300–800 m. ==Cultural significance== Temple complex at the top of Mount Tai Sunrise viewed from Lu-Viewing Platform Mount Tai is of key importance in Chinese religion, being the eastern one of the five Sacred Mountains of China. According to historical records, Mount Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou Dynasty before 1000 BC. A total of 72 emperors were recorded as visiting it. Writers also came to acquire inspiration, to compose poems, write essays, paint and take pictures. Hence, a great many cultural relics were left on the mountain. ===Deities associated to Mount Tai=== Great Deity of Mount Tai The Great Deity of Mount Tai () is the supreme god of Mount Tai. According to one mythological tradition, he is a descendant of Pangu. According to other theologies, he is the eastern one of the Five Manifestations of the Highest Deity (Wufang Shangdi). Bixia Yuanjun Bixia Yuanjun (), literally the \\"Goddess of the Blue Dawn\\", also known as the \\"Heavenly Immortal Lady of Jade\\" () or the \\"Lady of Mount Tai\\" (). According to some mythological accounts, she is the daughter or the consort of the Great Deity of Mount Tai. Statues of Bixia Yuanjun often depict her holding a tablet with the Big Dipper as a symbol of her authority. Yanguang Nainai Yanguang Nainai () is venerated as goddess of eyesight and often portrayed as an attendant to Bixia Yuanjun. Songzi Niangniang Songzi Niangniang () is seen as a goddess of fertility, like Yanguang Nainai, she is often portrayed as an attendant to Bixia Yuanjun. Shi Gandang Shi Gandang () is a spirit sent down from Mount Tai by Bixia Yuanjun to protect ordinary people from evil spirits. As part of cultural tradition, there will also often be Taishan Shi Gandang stones set up near buildings and other places, in order to protect those place from evil spirits. These are not to be confused with spirit tablets. ===Dai Miao=== Dai Temple at Mount Tai The Temple of the God of Mount Tai, known as the Dai Temple (), is the largest and most complete ancient building complex in the area. It is located at the foot of Mount Tai in the city of Tai'an and covers an area of 96,000 square meters. The temple was first built during the Qin Dynasty. Since the time of the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), its design has been a replica of the imperial palace, which makes it one out of three extant structures in China with the features of an imperial palace (the other two are the Forbidden City and the Confucius Temple in Qufu). The temple has five major halls and many small buildings. The centerpiece is the Palace of Heavenly Blessings (Tian Kuang), built in 1008, during the reign of the last Northern Song Emperor Huizong. The hall houses the mural painting \\"The God of Mount Tai Making a Journey\\", dated to the year 1009. The mural extends around the eastern, western and northern walls of the hall and is high and long. The theme of the painting is an inspection tour by the god. Next to the Palace of Heavenly Blessings stand the Yaocan Pavilion and the entrance archway as well as the Bronze Pavilion in the northeast corner. The Dai Temple is surrounded by 2,100‑year‑old cypresses that date back to the Han Dynasty. The oldest surviving stair may be the 6,000 granite steps to the top of the mountain. The site contains a number of well-preserved steles from the Huizong reign, some of which are mounted on bixi tortoises. There is a much later, Qianlong era bixi-mounted stele as well.Photos from Dai Miao Dongyue Temple at Mount Tai Zengfu Temple at Mount Tai ===Shrine of the Blue Dawn=== The Shrine of the Blue Dawn (), near the top of the mountain is another grand building complex, a special combination of metal components, wood, and bricks and stone structures. It is dedicated to the goddess Bixia (Blue Dawn). From the Taishan Temple to the Blue Dawn Temple there are numerous stone tablets and inscriptions and ancient buildings on the way. Visitors derive much pleasure from climbing Mount Taishan. From the red gate at the foot of the mountain to the South Heaven Gate at the top are some 6,660 stone steps, which wind their way up the mountain slopes, each step offering a different view. ===Shibapan=== The \\"Shibapan\\" () means 18 levels stairs, which is the most advantageous part of stairs in Mount Tai. A total of 1,827 stone steps, is one of the main signs Mount Tai. People always say: \\"Mount Tai of the majestic, all in Shibapan, Mount Tai of the sublime, all in the climb in!\\" Shibapan has three parts, the \\"Slow Eighteens\\"(), the \\"Hard Eighteens\\"(), and the \\"No slow no hard Eighteens\\" (). The \\"Slow Eighteens\\" means this period is easier to climb, and the \\"Hard Eighteens\\" means it is harder to climb, which is interesting. ===Other monuments=== A flight of 7,200 total steps (including inner temple steps), with 6,293 Official Mountain Walkway Steps, lead up the East Peak of Mount Tai, along its course, there are 11 gates, 14 archways, 14 kiosks, and four pavilions. In total, there are 22 temples, 97 ruins, 819 stone tablets, and 1,018 cliff-side and stone inscriptions located on Mount Tai. These include a Temple of the Jade King (), a Temple of the Blue Deity (), a Temple of Confucius (), a Temple of Doumu () and the Puzhao Buddhist Temple (). Among the tablets and inscriptions on the top of Mount Tai, the inscription that declares Mount Tai the \\"Most Revered of the Five Sacred Mountains\\" () on the \\"Sun Viewing Peak\\" () is particularly renown. It was written by a member of the Aisin Gioro clan () in 1907 and is featured on the reverse side of the five yuan bill of the 5th series renminbi banknotes. Another inscription marks the \\"Lu-Viewing Platform\\" () from which Confucius took in the view over his home state of Lu and then pronounced \\"The world is small\\". The Wordless Stela () stands in front of the Jade Emperor Temple. Legend has it that the emperor who commissioned the stela was dissatisfied with the planned inscription and decided to leave it blank instead. ===Other significant places=== *Suicide Cliff (), renamed Loving Life Cliff () in the Ming Dynasty *Sun-Viewing Peak () *Moon-Viewing Peak () *Gaze over Shandong Platform () *Explore the Sea (of Clouds) Rock () ==Infrastructure== Rock inscriptions at Mount Tai Visitors can reach the peak of Mount Tai via a bus which terminates at the Midway Gate to Heaven, from there a cable car connects to the summit. Covering the same distance on foot takes from two and a half to six hours. The supplies for the many vendors along the road to the summit are carried up by porters either from the Midway Gate to Heaven or all the way up from the foot of the mountain. To climb up the mountain, one can take one of two routes. The more popular east route starts from Taishan Arch. On the way up the 7,200 stone steps, the climber first passes the Ten Thousand Immortals Tower (Wanxianlou), Arhat Cliff (Luohanya), and Palace to Goddess Dou Mu (Doumugong). The climbing from the First Gate to Heaven (yi1 tian1 men2), the main entrance bordering on Tai'an town, up the entire mountain can take two and a half hours for the sprinting hiker to six hours for the leisure pace. Reaching the Midway Gate to Heaven from First Gate to Heaven is one hour at a sprint up to two and a half hours leisurely. To the northeast of the Palace to Goddess Dou Mu is Sutra Rock Valley in which the Buddhist Diamond Sutra was cut in characters measuring fifty centimeters across believed to be inscribed in the Northern Wei Dynasty. The west route, taken by fewer tourists, is more scenic, but has less cultural heritage. ==Cultural references== Climbing Mount Tai * In the novel Jin Ping Mei, the Moon Lady makes a pilgrimage to T'ai Shan, ...\\"they came to the Golden Palace of Niang-niang.

It is one of the two main polarities in the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, along with Kalevala or Väinölä. ==Significance in Kalevala- poetry== Christfried Ganander, in his 1789 Mythologia Fennica, characterised Pohjola as 'the most extreme North, described as a dark and terrible place. Tartarus and Ultima Thule'.'Yttersta Norden, beskrives såsom en mörk och förfärlig ort. Tartarus & ultima Thule'. Christfrid Ganander, Mythologia fennica, eller förklaring öfver de nomina propria deastrorum, idolorum, locorum, virorum, &c.; eller afgudar och afgudinnor, forntidens märkelige personar, offer och offer-ställen, gamla sedvänjor, jätter, trol, skogs- sjö och bergs-rån m. m. Som förekomma i de äldre finska troll-runor, synnyt, sanat, sadut, arwotuxet &c.; samt än brukas och nämnas i dagligt tal; til deras tjenst, som vela is grund förstå det finska språket, och hafva smak för finska historien och poëin, af gamla runor samlad och uttydd (Åbo: Frenckell, 1789), p. 71; https://books.google.fi/books?id=MDVKAAAAYAAJ&. Elias Lönnrot, one of the principal collectors of Finnish folk poetry and composer of the Kalevala, went to some lengths to interpret Pohjola as a real region, considering whether its inhabitants might be Saami or Finns, and precisely where areas such as Luotela/Luode ('North-West region'), Pimentola ('region of darkness'), Sariola, and Untamola/Uni ('region of sleep') might be;Juha Y. Pentikäinen, Kalevala Mythology: Expanded Edition, ed. and trans. by Ritva Poom (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999), pp. 170-71. many other scholars followed in the same vein.Anna-Leena Siikala, Mythic Images and Shamanism: A Perspective on Kalevala Poetry, FF Communication, 280 (Helsinki: Suomen Tiedakatemia, 2002), pp. 155-59. However, the idea of an otherworldly far north is a widespread motif in both Classical and medieval European literature, and has a corresponding concept, boasso, in Saami culture. Thus Pohjola can be thought of as a purely abstract place, a literary trope standing as the source of evil -- a foreboding, a forever cold land far in the north.Juha Y. Pentikäinen, Kalevala Mythology: Expanded Edition, ed. and trans. by Ritva Poom (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999), pp. 171-76. In The Kalevala, Pohjola's main function is to be the home of women whom the male heroes, from the land of Kalevala, seek as wives.Juha Y. Pentikäinen, Kalevala Mythology: Expanded Edition, ed. and trans. by Ritva Poom (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 172, citing Nils Lid, 'Kalevalan Pohjola', Kalevalaseuran vuosikirja, 29 (1949), 104-20. The Mistress of Pohjola is Louhi, an evil witch of great power. The great smith Seppo Ilmarinen forges the Sampo at her request as a payment for the hand of her daughter in marriage. The Sampo is a magic mill of plenty like the Cornucopia, which churns out abundance, but its churning lid has also been interpreted as a symbol of the celestial vault of the heavens, embedded with stars, revolving around a central axis or the pillar of the world. Other Kalevala characters also seek marriage with the daughters of Pohjola. These include the adventurer Lemminkäinen and the great wise man Väinämöinen. Louhi demands deeds similar to the forging of Sampo from them, such as shooting the Swan of Tuonela. When the proposer finally gets the daughter, weddings and great drinking and eating parties are held at the great hall of Pohjola. The foundation of the world pillar, also thought of as the root of the \\"world tree\\", was probably located, from the Finnish mythological perspective, somewhere just over the northern horizon, in Pohjola. The pillar was thought to rest on the Pohjantähti or North Star (also known as the pole star in English). The forging and hoarding of the Sampo and its abundance by the witch Louhi inside a great mountain in the dark reaches of Pohjola; the struggle and war by the people of the south to free the Sampo and capture it for their own needs and the subsequent shattering of the Sampo and the loss of its all- important lid (which implies the breaking of the world tree at the north pole) together constitute the bulk of the Kalevala material.Grottasõngr: The Song of Grotti, ed. by Clive Tolley (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2008), pp. 19-20. ==In music== Pohjola's Daughter is a symphonic tone poem by Jean Sibelius. The Finnish metal band Sentenced used the frozen land of Pohjola as inspiration for the albums Journey to Pohjola and North from Here released in 1992 and 1993. Pohjola is also the name of a song on an album Unsung Heroes by a Finnish folk metal band Ensiferum. The lyrics are based on a poem by 19th century freiherr and politician Yrjö Koskinen. The Finnish folk metal band Moonsorrow has a song entitled \\"Taistelu Pohjolasta\\" (\\"The Battle for Pohjola\\"). Two different versions of it appear on their 1999 demo Tämä ikuinen talvi (This Eternal Winter) and their 2008 EP Tulimyrsky (Firestorm). ==Other uses== In modern Finnish usage, Pohjola or Pohjoismaat is Finnish for the Nordic countries, the equivalent of which in Scandinavian languages is Norden.

He is the middle child of Peter and Lois Griffin and brother of Stewie and Meg Griffin. He is voiced by Seth Green and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in a 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Chris was created and designed by MacFarlane himself, who was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve, two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the greenlight, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". Originally designed as a somewhat gregarious, yet still unintelligent teenager, Chris became more awkward and idiotic over the course of the show. Running gags in the series involving Chris include the existence of an 'Evil Monkey' in his closet (though it is later revealed that the monkey is not evil), him masturbating frequently, and his pedophile admirer Herbert. ==Character origins== Chris' character resembles that of Milt's, the son of the main character Larry Cummings in The Life of Larry, one of the animated short films created by Seth MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1995 that led to the development of Family Guy. ==Personality== Similar to Meg, Chris is a typical adolescent boy, albeit one who comes off as being good-natured and easygoing. As such, he tends to take things with stride, not worrying about much, and he seems to enjoy his position in life. On the Volume 1 DVD Boxset TV guides special Family Guy edition, it is stated that Chris \\"wouldn't hurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog\\". Chris is willing to take drastic measures to get what he wants or needs, particularly when it comes to keeping up with his grades in school. He once believed that he got a bad grade on his geometry test when he tickled his brain by sticking an army man's rifle into his nose and accidentally puncturing a lobe. However, Chris is a faster learner and more well-endowed than Peter is, as he has a variety of talents, such as filmmaking, video editing, etc. In \\"Patriot Games\\", when the family moved to London, Chris was the only member of the family who learned how to speak cockney English in a matter of seconds. Chris shares most of Peter's stupidity and lack of common sense, tending to be absent-minded and getting confused easily; in \\"Lethal Weapons\\", when Peter and Lois were having a fist fight, Chris cheered for the former, telling him to \\"kick her ass!\\"; earlier in the episode, after Chris breaks a vase with his basketball and Lois tells Peter to punish him with a spanking, Peter tells him to \\"punish [himself]\\" and subsequently spanks himself. Also, in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, when the children watch Lois and Peter trying to make out, Chris mistakes it for a fight and says, \\"Meg, why do you think they're fighting?\\", but Meg angrily whispers to him \\"They're not,\\" In the episode \\"Trading Places\\", after Chris accidentally damages Peter's dirt bike, Peter \\"punishes\\" him by making him start smoking. Though Meg gets humiliated or embarrassed by his actions like she does with Peter's actions, Chris loves and cares for her deeply, and the two are frequently shown to get along very well, much to Lois's relief.Lethal Weapons. Season 3, Episode 7. Up until sometime during the sixth season, Chris was more socially active at school than his sister Meg, having various friends, including several girls, while attending Buddy Cianci Junior High School, and later for sometime at James Woods Regional High School (now called Adam West High School). Strangely though, as the series progressed and Meg became more often seen with her group of friends, Chris' social status was stripped to the point of being unpopular and virtually friendless at James Woods Regional High School. While just as socially looked down upon as Meg (though to a lesser extent of being bullied), he is outwardly confident and spirited, mostly when dealing the ups and downs of being a teenager, such as running for Homecoming King, standing up to bullies, lashing out against his date, and frequently acting out against Peter's hurtful ways. In \\"Stew-Roids\\", Chris's popularity increases when the school's queen bee, Connie D'Amico, dates him. At first she does this to be more popular because of \\"dating a loser\\", but she begins to see Chris as he really is after he says he likes her. Later in the episode, however, Chris' popularity turns him mean and shallow, and he dumps Connie after making out with two other girls at a house party. Connie and Meg then briefly team up to humiliate Chris by having Neil Goldman show the school a video of him re-enacting a scene from The Silence of the Lambs in which Buffalo Bill dances nude in front of a mirror, resulting in Connie regaining her popularity, while Chris is socially demoted back to an outcast. In \\"Once Bitten\\", Chris befriends Neil Goldman, the resident \\"nerd/geek\\" and Meg's self-proclaimed love interest. Although their friendship was initially a ploy for Neil to get closer to Meg, Neil feels bad for using Chris and returns to him to resume their friendship. ==Evil Monkey== As a running gag, starting in the episode \\"Dammit Janet!\\", Chris is regularly tormented by the Evil Monkey, who lives in his closet, though whenever he complains about it to anyone, they often laugh along with him instead thinking it is a joke, after which the monkey appears with a malevolent grimace and points at Chris in a threatening manner. In \\"Hannah Banana\\", Chris proves the monkey's existence to the family, though ends up becoming friends with him after the monkey (who appears not to be evil at all, but just a poor creature who was depressed after his ex-wife cheated on him with another monkey) helps him write out a book report and pass. The simian explains his frightening mannerisms as a result of various conditions and unintended actions. Chris introduces him to his friends, hang out with each other in \\"fun\\" places, and the monkey helps Chris in his studies in school, which Peter does not do. This, however, causes a rift between Chris and Peter when the former realizes that the monkey cares more for him than his father. Eventually the Evil Monkey helps the two patch things up, especially after Peter saves the monkey from Miley Cyrus (who is depicted as an android) who had kidnapped him à la King Kong. After that, the monkey happily moves out of Chris' closet to live in the closet of Tom Tucker's son Jake, where the cycle will start in a new beginning, as Jake himself experiences difficulty with his father. In a 2003 interview, Seth MacFarlane stated that the writers thought it would be funny to give Chris a childhood fear that is actually real, since he has \\"a childlike mind\\". The monkey's trademark grimace and pointing was the idea of writer Mike Barker. ==Identification with Seth Green== Another running gag, starting in the Star Wars remake episode \\"Blue Harvest\\", has Chris defending Robot Chicken, a show created by portrayer Seth Green that is broadcast on the Adult Swim block on the children's cable network Cartoon Network. When Peter (Seth MacFarlane) denigrates that show in \\"Blue Harvest\\", Chris loses his temper and storms off. Carried on in \\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\\", though Chris attempts to keep a cool head, he storms off again when Peter offers to tell the story of Without a Paddle, a critically panned film that features Seth Green. Both these scenes happen in the framing device of the episode and not in the interior Star Wars narrative, in which Green portrays Chris as Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker. In the final Star Wars parody, \\"It's a Trap!\\", mocking Green's career provokes further anger in Chris, who tries to defend Green by citing Buffy the Vampire Slayer as an example of a success in Green's career, but Carter Pewterschmidt suggests that the popularity of Buffy had been largely over-stated by Entertainment Weekly. These taunts give Chris—in character as Skywalker—the conviction to fight back against Stewie/Darth Vader and Carter/Darth Sidious (both played by MacFarlane). In the closing scenes of the episode's framing device, Chris gets to reverse the joke by poking fun at Seth MacFarlane's career, going so far as to suggest that Family Guy is a rip-off of The Simpsons; MacFarlane is, however, defended by the characters whom he voices (Peter, Brian and Stewie). Outside of the Star Wars-themed episodes, \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" plays on the running gag, but with Stewie (MacFarlane once more) provoking the Robot Chicken universe counterpart of Chris by asking \\"How does it feel to be on a major network for thirty seconds?\\", which prompts Chris to say \\"F*** you!\\" Chris' birthday is February 8, the same day as his voice actor, Seth Green. ==References== ==External links== * Chris Griffin at Fox.com Category:Family Guy characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional characters from Rhode Island Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Male characters in animation Category:American male characters in television Category:Animated human characters Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims sv:Family Guy#Chris Griffin ","title":"Chris Griffin"},{"id":"530238","text":"Cooking off (or thermally induced firing) is ammunition exploding prematurely due to heat in the surrounding environment. A fast cook-off is a cook-off caused by fire. A slow cook-off is caused by a sustained thermal event less intense than fire. A cooked-off round may cause a sympathetic detonation of adjacent rounds. Insensitive munitions are designed to be less vulnerable to accidental firing induced by external heat. == Artillery == Inherent design flaws in early 17th century Swedish leather cannons led to the gun tube overheating which prematurely ignited the gunpowder, injuring the loader. Muzzle-loading cannon on merchant and naval vessels of the Age of Sail would cook off if their guns were loaded when the vessels caught fire. Examples include the merchantman and After the cooking off of artillery shells in the G5 howitzers in the late 1980s, the South African Army changed commands from \\"cease fire\\" to \\"cease loading\\". This allowed crews to fire any loaded shells to prevent them from heating up and exploding. == Machine guns == Cooking off is a characteristic of certain air-cooled machine guns firing from a closed bolt. In such a design, when the trigger is released the weapon feed leaves a final round in the chamber. Residual heat conducts through the cartridge case. If the kindling point of the propellant is eventually reached it will burn even though the primer has not been struck, thus firing the chambered round. Nitrocellulose, the primary component of modern smokeless powder, has a relatively low autoignition temperature of around .Chemical and Physical Properties of Nitrocellulose Contrary to popular myth, this will not cause the machine gun to \\"runaway\\" at cyclic rate of fire (as compared to a slamfire) because each chambered round has to first be brought up to temperature. The time this takes depends on the temperature of the chamber and of the environment, but is usually several seconds, although if caused deliberately may be very fast. During this time the barrel is cooling. Cook offs in machine guns are prevented by: * Cased ammunition: Among its many functions, the metallic cartridge case acts as a heat sink protecting the propellant from chamber heat. The case must first be brought up to temperature before the propellant inside can burn. * Cooling: Barrels can be liquid-cooled (like a radiator in an automobile engine), or exchanged periodically. Most modern infantry machine guns (GPMG, general-purpose machine gun) are issued with several quick change barrels that are swapped out allowing one barrel to cool while the gun fires with the other. * Open bolt: Most modern infantry machine guns (and submachine guns) fire from an open bolt, meaning the bolt remains to the rear when the trigger is released. Pulling the trigger releases the bolt forward and fires the weapon simultaneously. Assuming proper operation (no stoppages) a cook off is not possible with this design because a cartridge is not chambered until the moment the trigger is pulled and the weapon is fired, thus there is nothing in the chamber. === Closed bolt === Most modern infantry assault rifles fire from a closed bolt, meaning that when ready to fire, there is a round in the chamber of the barrel and the bolt and working parts are in the forward position, closing the breech. Squeezing the trigger releases the striker or hammer, firing the cartridge in the chamber. Assuming proper operation (no stoppages) a cook off is possible with this design because a cartridge is kept chambered in the potentially hot chamber, where it can absorb enough heat to cause ignition of its propellant.Colt Canada OPERATORS INSTRUCTIONS C7 FAMILY OF COMBAT WEAPONS stating at page 7; \\"The C7 family of weapons can fire the entire combat load of 150 rounds at any rate of fire without danger of cookoff.\\" Apart from the possibility to cook off the heated propellant requires a special formula to allow for consistent muzzle velocity throughout all temperatures. === Caseless ammunition === Caseless ammunition eliminates the metal case that typically holds the primer or igniter and the powder charge (smokeless powder) that propels the bullet. The metal case absorbs a large portion of the waste heat of firing. Ejecting this hot, empty case removes that heat from the weapon. With caseless rounds, other means of reducing waste heat are necessary, especially in automatic fire. == Tanks == Cooking off is a serious hazard to crews in damaged and disabled tanks. Attempted solutions include storing ammunition under water and insulating ammunition compartments. The current technique, used in tanks such as the M1 Abrams, is to armor the compartments and provide blow-off panels to channel the force of the explosion to the exterior of the tank and prevent the jack- in-the-box effect. == Missiles and air-dropped bombs == The risk of aircraft armament cooking off is a significant hazard during pre-flight operations, especially for aircraft carriers. Fuel fires, which can spread across the flight deck rapidly and engulf many aircraft, are the most serious risk. This was a significant contributor to the 1967 fire disaster aboard the , when such a fire (set off by an inadvertently fired Zuni rocket striking the fuel tanks of a waiting A-4 Skyhawk) detonated two unguided bombs of Korean War vintage which had been loaded onto the stricken bomber, rupturing the fuel tanks of adjacent aircraft and setting off a chain reaction of similarly cooked off bombs. Because of the age and condition of the first two bombs, the fire safety crew was unable to cool them before they cooked off, which should have been possible for contemporary weapons with higher cook-off temperatures. A different sort of cook-off event was the trigger for the 1969 explosion and fire aboard the , which also involved a Zuni rocket. During this event, the exhaust from an MD-3A \\"Huffer\\" Air Start Unit (ASU) overheated the warhead of a Zuni that was mounted on a parked aircraft, causing it to cook off. As with the Forrestal disaster, this led to procedural and equipment changes, specifically regarding ASUs. == See also == * Sympathetic detonation * == References == Category:Ammunition Category:Military terminology MIL-STD-2105D \\"HAZARD ASSESSMENT TESTS FOR NON-NUCLEAR MUNITIONS\\", 19 April 2011 ","title":"Cooking off"},{"id":"530255","text":"Close-up view of microfiber cloth Microfiber cloth suitable for cleaning sensitive surfaces Microfiber (or microfibre) is synthetic fiber finer than one denier or decitex/thread, having a diameter of less than ten micrometres. A strand of silk is about one denier and about a fifth of the diameter of a human hair. The most common types of microfiber are made variously of polyesters; polyamides (e.g., nylon, Kevlar, Nomex, trogamide); and combinations of polyester, polyamide, and polypropylene. Microfiber is used to make mats, knits, and weaves, for apparel, upholstery, industrial filters, and cleaning products. The shape, size, and combinations of synthetic fibers are chosen for specific characteristics, including softness, toughness, absorption, water repellence, electrostatics, and filtering ability. ==History== Production of ultra-fine fibers (finer than 0.7 denier) dates from the late 1950s, using melt-blown spinning and flash spinning techniques. Initially, only fine staples of random length could be manufactured and very few applications were found.Nakajima T, Kajiwara K, McIntyre J E, 1994. Advanced Fiber Spinning Technology . Woodhead Publishing, pp. 187–188 Then came experiments to produce ultra-fine fibers of a continuous filament type: the most promising experiments were made in Japan in the 1960s, by Dr. Miyoshi Okamoto, a scientist at Toray Industries.Kanigel, Robert, 2007. Faux Real: Genuine Leather and 200 Years of Inspired Fakes . Joseph Henry Press, pp. 186–192 Okamoto's discoveries and those of Dr. Toyohiko Hikota led to many industrial applications, including Ultrasuede, one of the first successful synthetic microfibers, which entered the market in the 1970s. Microfiber's use in the textile industry then expanded. Microfibers were first publicized in the early 1990s, in Sweden, and saw success as a product in Europe over the course of the decade. ==ApparelClothing=== Microfiber fabric is frequently used for athletic wear, such as cycling jerseys, because the microfiber material wicks moisture (perspiration) away from the body; subsequent evaporation cools the wearer. Microfiber is also very elastic, making it suitable for undergarments. Microfiber can be used to make tough, very soft fabric for clothing, often used in skirts and jackets. Microfiber fabric can also be used in bathrobes, jackets, swim trunks, and other aquatic apparel. Microfiber can be made into Ultrasuede, a synthetic imitation of suede leather, which is cheaper and easier to clean and sew than natural suede leather. ===Accessories=== Microfiber is used to make many accessories that traditionally have been made from leather: wallets, handbags, backpacks, book covers, shoes, cell phone cases, and coin purses. Microfiber fabric is lightweight, durable, and somewhat water repellent, so it makes a good substitute. Another advantage of Microfiber fabric (compared to leather) is that it can be coated with various finishes and can be treated with antibacterial chemicals. Fabric can also be printed with various designs, embroidered with colored thread, and heat-embossed. ==Other usesTextiles for cleaning=== Cross sections: microfiber thread above, cotton thread below Microfiber cloth for cleaning screens and lenses Microfiber mop with velcro back for fastening on handle In cleaning products, microfiber can be 100% polyester, or a blend of polyester and polyamide (nylon). It can be either a woven product or a non woven product, the latter most often used in limited use or disposable cloths. In the highest-quality fabrics for cleaning applications, the fiber is split during the manufacturing process to produce multi-stranded fibers. A cross section of the split microfiber fabric under high magnification would look like an asterisk. The split fibers and the size of the individual filaments make the cloths more effective than other fabrics for cleaning purposes. The structure traps and retains the dirt and also absorbs liquids. Unlike cotton, microfiber leaves no lint, the exception being some micro suede blends, where the surface is mechanically processed to produce a soft plush feel. For microfiber to be most effective as a cleaning product, especially for water-soluble soils and waxes, it should be a split microfiber. Non-split microfiber is little more than a very soft cloth. The main exception is for cloths used for facial cleansing and for the removal of skin oils (sebum), sunscreens, and mosquito repellents from optical surfaces such as cameras, phones and eyeglasses wherein higher-end proprietary woven, 100% polyester cloths using 2 µm filaments, will absorb these types of oils without smearing. Microfiber that is used in non-sports-related clothing, furniture, and other applications isn't split because it isn't designed to be absorbent, just soft. When buying, microfiber may not be labelled to designate whether it is split. One way to determine what microfiber it is, is to run the cloth over the palm of the hand. A split microfiber will cling to imperfections of the skin and can be either heard or felt. Another way is to pour a small amount of water on a hard flat surface and try to push the water with the microfiber. If the water is pushed rather than being absorbed, it's not split microfiber. Microfiber can be electrostatically charged for special purposes like filtration.\\"SYNTHETIC SPLIT MICROFIBER TECHNOLOGY FOR FILTRATION \\" by Jeff Dugan, Vice President Research and Development Fiber Innovation Technologies and Ed Homonoff President Edward C. Homonoff & Associates, LLC ===Cloths and mops=== Microfiber products used for consumer cleaning are generally constructed from split conjugated fibers of polyester and polyamide. Microfiber used for commercial cleaning products also includes many products constructed of 100% polyester. Microfiber products have exceptional ability to absorb oils, and are not hard enough to scratch even paintwork unless they have retained grit or hard particles from previous use. Due to hydrogen bonding, microfibre cloth containing polyamide absorbs and holds more water than other types of fibres. Microfiber is widely used by car detailers to handle tasks such as removing wax from paintwork, quick detailing, cleaning interior, cleaning glass, and drying. Because of their fine fibers which leave no lint or dust, microfiber towels are used by car detailers and enthusiasts in a similar manner to a chamois leather. Microfiber is used in many professional cleaning applications, for example in mops and cleaning cloths. Although microfiber mops cost more than non-microfiber mops, they may be more economical because they last longer and require less effort to use.UC Davis Health System: Newroom. UC Davis Pioneers Use of Microfiber Mops in Hospitals: Mops reduce injuries, kill more germs and reduce costs. June 23, 2006.Sustainable Hospitals Project, University of Massachusetts Lowell. 10 Reasons to Use Microfiber Mopping. Microfiber textiles designed for cleaning clean on a microscopic scale. According to tests using microfiber materials to clean a surface leads to reducing the number of bacteria by 99%, whereas a conventional cleaning material reduces this number only by 33%.UC Davis Health System: Newroom  UC Davis Pioneers Use Of Microfiber Mops In Hospitals. Ucdmc.ucdavis.edu. Retrieved on 2010-12-01. Microfiber cleaning tools also absorb fat and grease and their electrostatic properties give them a high dust-attracting power. Microfiber cloths are used to clean photographic lenses as they absorb oily matter without being abrasive or leaving a residue, and are sold by major manufacturers such as Sinar, Nikon and Canon. Small microfiber cleaning cloths are commonly sold for cleaning computer screens and eyeglasses. Microfiber is unsuitable for some cleaning applications as it accumulates dust, debris, and particles. Sensitive surfaces (such as all high- tech coated surfaces e.g. CRT, LCD and plasma screens) can easily be damaged by a microfiber cloth if it has picked up grit or other abrasive particles during use. One way to minimize the risk of damage to flat surfaces is to use a flat, non-rugged microfiber cloth, as these tend to be less prone to retaining grit. Rags made of microfiber must only be washed with regular laundry detergent, not oily, self-softening, soap-based detergents. Fabric softener must not be used. The oils and cationic surfactants in the softener and self-softening detergents will clog up the fibers and make them less absorbent until the oils are washed out. Also, since microfibre cloth attracts much soil and holds water tightly, it provides an ideal nutritional environment for various microorganisms. ===Insulation=== Microfiber materials such as PrimaLoft are used for thermal insulation as a replacement for down feather insulation in sleeping bags and outdoor equipment, because of their better retention of heat when damp or wet. Microfiber is also used for water insulation in automotive car covers. Depending on the technology the fiber manufacturer is using, such material may contain from 2 up to 5 thin layers, merged. Such combination ensures not only high absorption factor, but also breathability of the material, which prevents greenhouse effect. ===Basketballs=== With microfiber-shelled basketballs already used by FIBA, the NBA introduced a microfiber ball for the 2006–07 season.NBA Introduces New Game Ball . NBA.com, June 28, 2006. The ball, which is manufactured by Spalding, does not require a \\"break-in\\" period of use as leather balls do and has the ability to absorb water and oils, meaning that sweat from players touching the ball is better absorbed, making the ball less slippery. Over the course of the season, the league received many complaints from players who found that the ball bounced differently from leather balls, and that it left cuts on their hands.Josh Hart, NBA to Take Microfiber Basketball and Go Home . National Ledger, December 12, 2006. On January 1, 2007, the league scrapped the use of all microfiber balls and returned to leather basketballs. ===Other=== Microfibers used in tablecloths, furniture, and car interiors are designed to repel wetting and consequently are difficult to stain. Microfiber tablecloths will bead liquids until they are removed and are sometimes advertised showing red wine on a white tablecloth that wipes clean with a paper towel. This and the ability to mimic suede economically are common selling points for microfiber upholstery fabrics (e.g., for couches). Microfibers are used in towels especially those to be used at swimming pools as even a small towel dries the body quickly. They dry quickly and are less prone than cotton towels to become stale if not dried immediately. Microfiber towels need to be soaked in water and pressed before use, as they would otherwise repel water as microfiber tablecloths do. Microfiber is also used for other applications such as making menstrual pads, cloth diaper inserts, body scrubbers, face mitts, whiteboard cleaners, and various goods that need to absorb water and/or attract small particle. ==Environmental and safety issues== Microfiber textiles tend to be flammable if manufactured from hydrocarbons (polyester) or carbohydrates (cellulose) and emit toxic gases when burning, more so if aromatic (PET, PS, ABS) or treated with halogenated flame retardants and azo dyes. Their polyester and nylon stock are made from petrochemicals, which are not a renewable resource and are not biodegradable. For most cleaning applications they are designed for repeated use rather than being discarded after use.Barbara Flanagan, The Case of the Missing Microfiber. I.D., April 22, 2008. An exception to this is the precise cleaning of optical components where a wet cloth is drawn once across the object and must not be used again as the debris collected are now embedded in the cloth and may scratch the optical surface. Microfiber products may also have the potential of entering the oceanic water supply and food chain similar to other microplastics. Synthetic clothing made of microfibers that are washed release materials and travel to local wastewater treatment plants, contributing to plastic pollution in water. Fibers retained in wastewater treatment sludge (biosolids) that are land-applied can persist in soils. There are environmental concerns about this product entering the oceanic food chain similar to other microplastics. A study by the clothing brand Patagonia and University of California, Santa Barbara, found that when synthetic jackets made of microfibers are washed, on average of microfibers are released from the washing machine. These microfibers then travel to local wastewater treatment plants, where up to 40% of them enter into rivers, lakes, and oceans where they contribute to the overall plastic pollution. Microfibers account for 85% of man-made debris found on shorelines worldwide. ==See also== *Polyamide *Polyester *Polar fleece ==References== Category:Synthetic fibers Category:Textiles Category:Technical fabrics Category:Sustainable products ","title":"Microfiber"},{"id":"530256","text":"De dicto and de re are two phrases used to mark a distinction in intensional statements, associated with the intensional operators in many such statements. The distinction is used regularly in metaphysics and in philosophy of language.Semantics Archive discussion The literal translation of the phrase \\"de dicto\\" is \\"about what is said\\",http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/de-dicto whereas de re translates as \\"about the thing\\".http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/de-re?q=de+re The original meaning of the Latin locutions may help to elucidate the living meaning of the phrases, in the distinctions they mark. The distinction can be understood by examples of intensional contexts of which three are considered here: a context of thought, a context of desire, and a context of modality. ==Context of thought== There are two possible interpretations of the sentence \\"Peter believes someone is out to get him\\". On one interpretation, 'someone' is unspecific and Peter suffers a general paranoia; he believes that it is true that a person is out to get him, but does not necessarily have any beliefs about who this person may be. What Peter believes is that the predicate 'is out to get Peter' is satisfied. This is the de dicto interpretation. On the de re interpretation, 'someone' is specific, picking out some particular individual. There is some person Peter has in mind, and Peter believes that person is out to get him. In the context of thought, the distinction helps us explain how people can hold seemingly self-contradictory beliefs.Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). \\"Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate?\\" International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. Say Lois Lane believes Clark Kent is weaker than Superman. Since Clark Kent is Superman, taken de re, Lois's belief is untenable; the names 'Clark Kent' and 'Superman' pick out an individual in the world, and a person (or super-person) cannot be stronger than himself. Understood de dicto, however, this may be a perfectly reasonable belief, since Lois is not aware that Clark and Superman are one and the same. ==Context of desire== Consider the sentence \\"Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County\\". It could be read either de dicto or de re; the meanings would be different. One interpretation is that Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County, whoever he might be. On this interpretation, what the statement tells us is that Jana has a certain unspecific desire; what she desires is for Jana is marrying the tallest man in Fulsom County to be true. The desire is directed at that situation, regardless of how it is to be achieved. The other interpretation is that Jana wants to marry a certain man, who in fact happens to be the tallest man in Fulsom County. Her desire is for that man, and she desires herself to marry him. The first interpretation is the de dicto interpretation, because Jana's desire relates to the words \\"the tallest man in Fulsom country\\", and the second interpretation is the de re interpretation, because Jana's desire relates to the man those words refer to. Another way to understand the distinction is to ask what Jana would want if a nine-foot-tall immigrant moved to Fulsom county. If she continued to want to marry the same man - and perceived this as representing no change in her desires - then she could be taken to have meant the original statement in a de re sense. If she no longer wanted to marry that man but instead wanted to marry the new tallest man in Fulsom County, and saw this as a continuation of her earlier desire, then she meant the original statement in a de dicto sense. ==Context of modality== The number of discovered chemical elements is 118. Take the sentence \\"The number of chemical elements is necessarily greater than 100\\". Again, there are two interpretations as per the de dicto/de re distinction. According to the de dicto interpretation, even if the inner workings of the atom could differ, the number of elements could not be 100 or less. The second interpretation, de re, is that things could not have gone differently with the number 118 turning out to be greater than 100. Another example: \\"The President of the USA in 2001 could not have been Al Gore\\". This claim seems false on a de dicto reading. Presumably, things could have gone differently, with the Supreme Court not ruling that Bush had won the election. The sentence is trivially true with a de re reading: \\"George Bush could not have been Al Gore\\". ==Representing de dicto and de re in modal logic== In modal logic the distinction between de dicto and de re is one of scope. In de dicto claims, any existential quantifiers are within the scope of the modal operator, whereas in de re claims the modal operator falls within the scope of the existential quantifier. For example: { border=\\"0\\"  De dicto:  \\\\Box \\\\exists{x} Ax  Necessarily, some x is such that it is A -  De re:  \\\\exists{x} \\\\Box Ax  Some x is such that it is necessarily A } ==See also== * Barcan formula * De se * Latitudinarianism (philosophy) * Quantifier raising ==References== ==Bibliography== *Burge, Tyler. 1977.

In the light of later research his writings are not of much value as regards trustworthy criticism, though they are useful as catalogues of art treasures in private collections at the time when they were compiled. His opinions were greatly respected in England, where he was invited to give evidence before the royal commission inquiring into the condition and future of the National Gallery, for which he was a leading candidate to become director. He died on a visit to Copenhagen in 1868. ==Biography== \\"Portrait of Gustav Friedrich Waagen\\"; Ludwig Knaus (1855) Waagen was born in Hamburg, the son of a painter and nephew of the poet Ludwig Tieck. Having passed through the college of Hirschberg, Silesia (modern Jelenia Góra), he volunteered for service in the Napoleonic campaign of 1813-14, and on his return attended the lectures at Breslau University. He devoted himself to the study of art, which he pursued in the great European galleries, first in Germany, then in the Netherlands and Italy. A pamphlet on the brothers Van Eyck led in 1832 to his appointment to the directorship of the newly founded Berlin Museum (now vastly expanded as the Berlin State Museums), although his main interest was the paintings in what is now the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. The result of a journey to London and Paris was an important publication in three volumes, Kunstwerke und Künstler in England und Paris (Berlin, 1837-39), which became the basis for his more important The Treasures of Art in Great Britain, translated by Elizabeth Eastlake, (4 vols, London, 1854 and 1857). This remains a significant source for the provenance of paintings then in English collections. Although Waagen has been criticised for his \\"amateurish and erratic expertise\\" by modern standards, his work was regarded as highly authoritative for the following half-century.Reitlinger, Gerald; The Economics of Taste, Vol I: The Rise and Fall of Picture Prices 1760-1960, p. 110, Barrie and Rockliffe, London, 1961 In 1844, he was appointed professor of art history at Berlin University, and in 1861 he was called to St Petersburg as adviser in the arranging and naming of the pictures in the imperial collection. On his return, he published a book on the Hermitage collection (Munich, 1864). Among his other publications are some essays on Rubens, Mantegna and Signorelli; Kunstwerke und Künstler in Deutschland; and Die vornehmsten Kunstdenkmäler in Wien. In 1849 Waagen became a corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. == References == ;Attribution * ==External links== *Online Text Treasures of Art in Great Britain: Being an Account of the Chief Collections of Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures, Illuminated Mss., &c.;, &c;, By Gustav Friedrich Waagen, Elizabeth Rigby Eastlake, Algernon Graves.

He was determined to remain as leader of the National Party, but in July 1974 was challenged for the leadership by Robert Muldoon, his deputy, rival and successor. Marshall's politeness and courtesy were well known, and he was sometimes nicknamed Gentleman Jack. He disliked the aggressive style of some politicians, preferring a calmer, less confrontational approach. These traits were sometimes misinterpreted as weakness by his opponents. Marshall was a strong believer in common sense and pragmatism, and he disliked what he considered populism in other politicians of his day. == Early life == Marshall was born in Wellington. He grew up in Wellington, Whangarei, and Dunedin, attending Whangarei Boys' High School and Otago Boys' High School. He was noted for his ability at sports, particularly rugby. After leaving high school, Marshall studied law at Victoria University College. He gained an LL.B. in 1934 and an LL.M. in 1935. He also worked part-time in a law office. He also wrote a series of children's books called Dr Duffer. In 1941, during World War II, Marshall entered the army, and received officer training. In his first few years of service, he was posted to Fiji, Norfolk Island, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands, eventually reaching the rank of major. During this time he also spent five months in the United States at a marine staff school in Virginia. On 29 July 1944, while on leave in Perth, Western Australia, Marshall married Jessie Margaret Livingston, a nurse. At the start of 1945, Marshall was assigned to a unit sent to reinforce New Zealand forces in the Middle East. This unit later participated in the battle of the Senio River and the liberation of Trieste. == Member of Parliament == After the war, Marshall briefly established himself as a barrister, but was soon persuaded to stand as the National Party's candidate for the new Wellington seat of Mt Victoria in the 1946 election. He won the seat by 911 votes. He was, however, nearly disqualified by a technicality – Marshall was employed at the time in a legal case for the government, something which ran afoul of rules barring politicians from giving business to their own firms. However, because Marshall had taken on the case before his election (and so could not have influenced the government's decision to give him employment), it was obvious that there had been no wrongdoing. As such, the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser of the Labour Party, amended the regulations. Marshall's political philosophy, which was well-defined at this stage, was a mixture of liberal and conservative values. He was opposed to laissez-faire capitalism, but was equally opposed to the redistribution of wealth advocated by socialists – his vision was of a property-owning society under the benign guidance of a fair and just government. Barry Gustafson states, \\"[Marshall] was strongly motivated by his Christian faith and by an equally deep intellectual commitment to the principles of liberalism.\\" === Cabinet Minister === In the 1949 election, Marshall kept his seat. The National Party gained enough seats to form a government, and Sidney Holland became Prime Minister. Marshall was elevated to Cabinet, taking the role of Minister of Statistics and also having ministerial responsibility for the State Advances Corporation. He also became a direct assistant to Holland. Marshall as a Cabinet minister in 1951 After the 1951 election, Marshall became Minister of Health (although he also retained responsibility for State Advances until 1953). In the 1954 election, his Mt Victoria seat was abolished, and he successfully stood for another Wellington electorate, Karori. After the election, he lost the Health portfolio, instead becoming Minister of Justice and Attorney-General. In these roles, he supported the retention of the capital punishment for murder. In 1957, he proposed a referendum on capital punishment. (New Zealand's last execution was carried out in 1957, during Marshall's time in office.) He also supported the creation of a separate Court of Appeal. When Holland became ill, Marshall was part of the group that persuaded him to step down. Keith Holyoake became Prime Minister. Marshall sought the deputy leadership, managing to defeat Jack Watts for this post. The result was kept secret from the caucus and several cabinet ministers privately speculated that Watts had actually won, but Holyoake overturned the result, concerned with Watts' health. === Deputy Prime Minister === Shortly after the leadership change, National lost the 1957 election to Labour's Walter Nash. Marshall, therefore, became deputy leader of the Opposition. The Nash government did not last long, however – its drastic measures to counter an economic crisis proved unpopular. Marshall was later to admit that the crisis had been prompted by a failure to act by the National government. Labour lost the 1960 election, and National returned to power. Marshall in 1957 Marshall once more became Deputy Prime Minister, but rather than Attorney-General and Minister of Justice again he was allocated several new positions, including ministerial responsibility for Industries and Commerce, Overseas Trade, Immigration, and Customs. One of his major achievements was the signing of trade arrangements with Australia and the United Kingdom. Marshall also supported the abolition of compulsory union membership, which had been a National Party election policy – when the government eventually decided not to push forward with the change, Marshall's relations with some of his colleagues were strained. Marshall promoted the retention of capital punishment for murder. However, Labour under Arnold Nordmeyer was opposed, and in 1961 ten National MPs, including Robert Muldoon, crossed the floor and voted with Labour to abolish it. Increasingly, as time went on, Marshall became overworked, with Holyoake giving him more and more cabinet responsibilities. In the 1960s he led negotiations over trade consequences if Britain joined the European Economic Community. Marshall was also put under considerable pressure by ongoing labour disputes, which he took a significant role in resolving. Relations between Marshall and Robert Muldoon, the Minister of Finance, grew very tense, with Marshall resenting Muldoon's open interference in the labour negotiations. Marshall was also responsible for establishing the Accident Compensation Corporation. === Prime Minister === On 7 February 1972, Holyoake stepped down as Prime Minister. Marshall contested the leadership against Muldoon, and won. Muldoon became Deputy Prime Minister. Marshall was keen to organise the government, believing that it had become stagnated and inflexible. The public, however, were tired of the long-serving National government, and considered the reforms insufficient. In the 1972 general election, Norman Kirk's Labour Party was triumphant. On 8 December, after less than a year in office, Kirk was sworn in as Prime Minister and Marshall became the Leader of the Opposition. === Leader of the Opposition === Marshall became Leader of the Opposition in 1972. He made the choice to not separate the shadow cabinet from the rest of the caucus to encourage party unity. He made minimal changes to his portfolio allocations from February 1972 to highlight National's experience and stability, contrasting from the comparative inexperience of the new Labour Government. On 4 July 1974, Marshall was informed that a leadership challenge was imminent. Aware that much of his support had drained away, Marshall resigned, and Muldoon became party leader. Marshall's decline was primarily the result of his inability to damage the highly popular Kirk; Marshall's quiet, understated style did not fit well with the aggressive tactics required of an opposition party seeking to return to government. Ironically, Kirk died later that same year and his replacement, Bill Rowling, was perceived as a quiet and non- confrontational leader, just as Marshall had been. == Later life == He remained active in the National Party organisation, and was highly respected for his many years of service. Marshall was initially reticent on his successors activities, though he became publicly more critical of Muldoon's aggressive personality with time. Following the Moyle Affair he was interviewed on television about the incident in which he criticised Muldoon's behavior, of accusing Labour MP Colin Moyle of being picked up by the police for homosexual activities, stating \\"I think anyone who indulges in this kind of conduct is damaging himself and lowering the status of Parliament\\". Over time he grew ever more critical of Muldoon, accusing him of being overly aggressive and controlling. Muldoon's highly controversial decision to allow a visit by a rugby union team from apartheid South Africa exasperated Marshall even more. Marshall wrote and published several children's books, his memoirs and a law book. He was active in various charities and cultural organisations, including the New Zealand Chess Association, and was a founder of the New Zealand Portrait Gallery. Many of his later activities were related to his strong Christian faith. Marshall died in Snape, Suffolk, England, on 30 August 1988, en route to Budapest to give an address at the world conference of the United Bible Societies. He was survived by his wife and four children. ==Honours== In 1953, Marshall was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, and in 1977 he received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. In the 1973 New Year Honours, Marshall was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, in recognition of his service as New Zealand prime minister, and the following year he was bestowed with a knighthood as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. In the 1992 Queen's Birthday Honours, Margaret, Lady Marshall, was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for community service. ==Notes== ==References== * * * - - - - - - - Category:1912 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Attorneys- General of New Zealand Category:People educated at Otago Boys' High School Category:New Zealand Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire Category:New Zealand Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Category:New Zealand members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:New Zealand foreign ministers Category:New Zealand National Party MPs Category:New Zealand National Party leaders Category:New Zealand Presbyterians Category:People from Wellington City Category:Prime Ministers of New Zealand Category:Victoria University of Wellington alumni Category:Leaders of the Opposition (New Zealand) Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of New Zealand Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand MPs for Wellington electorates Category:New Zealand military personnel of World War II Category:20th-century New Zealand lawyers Category:People educated at Whangarei Boys' High School Category:20th-century New Zealand politicians Category:Recipients of the Silver World Award Category:New Zealand politicians awarded knighthoods Category:New Zealand Army officers ","title":"Jack Marshall"},{"id":"530265","text":"Lazar Gulkowitsch (; 20 December 1898 – July 1941), also Gulkovich or Gulkowicz; was an eminent Estonian Jewish Studies scholar. He was killed by the Nazis in the summer of 1941. ==Life== Born in Zirin, Minsk province, Russian Empire as the son of a merchant, Gulkowitsch attended school in Baranavichy and then the famous Mir Yeshiva. During World War I, the family fled to Nikolayev, Ukraine, where Gulkowitsch graduated from high school. In 1918-1919, Gulkowitsch went to Virbālis in Lithuania, where he headed a Hebrew-speaking basic school and was part of the Rabbinate. He then took up studying Medicine at the University of Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia), but also attended classes in Philosophy and Theology, especially Old Testament. In 1922, he received both a Ph.D. and an M.A., the former with a work on the Kabbalah, and in 1924, and M.D., with a specialization in ophthalmology. In Königsberg, Gulkowitsch married Frieda Rabinowitz (27 February 1900 – Fall 1941); the couple would have two daughters. Immediately after handing in his medical dissertation, however, Gulkowitsch had been invited by the University of Leipzig to take over the lectureship in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Talmudic Sciences from the renowned and recently deceased Israel Issar Kahan. Leipzig in Saxony was then the \\"mecca\\" of Oriental Studies in Germany, a very large and very highly regarded university (probably the best outside of Prussia). Gulkowitsch also became director of the Institute of Late Jewish Studies within the Old Testament division of the Divinity School. With his appointment, Gulkowitsch automatically became a German citizen. At Leipzig, Gulkowitsch not only taught but continued studying there, with the eminent scholars available (especially in Islamic Studies, Near Eastern Studies, Ethiopian Studies, and Assyriology, as well as Philosophy with the eminent Theodor Litt) towards his Habilitation, which he attained in 1927. Continuing at Leipzig as Privatdozent (unsalaried senior lecturer who may be called to a professorship), he became, in 1932, Professor extraordinary (full professor without a chair) of Late Jewish Studies within the Faculty of Philosophy, the only such position within a German university. However, already a year later, in 1933, due to the Nazi rise to power and the Nuremberg race laws (which were, i.a., directed against Jews as civil servants, which in Germany professors are), he was dismissed from the University of Leipzig. In the same year, however, the University of Tartu in Estonia, which had a very distinguished tradition of Oriental Studies and Hebrew, had opened, pushed by the local scholars and supported, i.a., by Albert Einstein - a new Institute of Jewish Studies – a remarkable and defiant feat for 1933, even for an independent country like Estonia proud of its minority rights laws. Gulkowitsch received the appointment as Professor and Chair of Jewish Studies and started teaching in Tartu in 1934. He attracted many high-calibre graduate students (mostly Jewish) and established an international publication series on Jewish Studies. Gulkowitsch taught in German; the Tartu institute was probably the only place in the world where scholarship on Jewish issues in German was possible to be upheld during times of the Holocaust. During his Tartu tenure, Gulkowitsch travelled as much abroad as was possible during that time, especially to Sweden (Uppsala University) and Britain (University of Cambridge). After the Soviet Union invaded and annexed Estonia for the first time in 1940, Gulkowitsch's chair was abolished in 1941 and he himself dismissed. When the Nazis invaded Estonia in the same year, Gulkowitsch and, perhaps some weeks later, his entire family were – like almost 1,000 Estonian Jews who had not been deported and remained there – murdered by the Nazis. ==Work== Gulkowitsch's methodology was philological, he approached his studies from the perspective of a critical reading of the relevant texts. Gulkowitsch's main areas of research covered the fields of: *Chassidism (towards which he was critical as an irrational and mystic phenomenon) *the Kabbalah (as a rational system) *linguistic history of Hebrew and methodology of philological approaches generally *translations and editions of Talmudic tracts *Maimonides and Spinoza The irrational-mystic approach to the study of religion also has its proponents (one could mention the tradition of Rudolf Otto and his classic The Holy (1917) here), but in the Comparative Religion field, Gulkowitsch's approach, if somehow modified, could today be considered mainstream. This is less so within Jewish Studies (and the study of that discipline), partially for historical reasons, because the rationalism of Gulkowitsch's style seemed to some unduly accommodationist to non-Jewish principles and systems of thought and too critical of its mystic traditions (Gulkowitsch indeed demystifies the Kabbala and the Talmud and is very critical of Chassidism). Thus, Jewish Studies scholars like Gerschom Sholem have criticized, and continue to criticize, Gulkowitsch's work. Because many of Gulkowitsch's writings after 1933 were published in German in Estonia, they were actually not very well distributed and did not become part of the scholarly discourse of Jewish Studies, although they are of an extremely high quality and put Gulkowitsch clearly at the forefront of his area. Recent efforts to republish his most significant works with Germany's leading publisher of Judaica, Mohr Siebeck in Tübingen, failed in 2005, after agreement with the press had already been reached, due to unknown reasons on the publishers' side. ==References== ==External links== *Gulkowitsch's Memorial page at Yad Vashem Category:1898 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Belarusian Jews Category:Estonian Jews Category:University of Tartu faculty Category:Talmudists ","title":"Lazar Gulkowitsch"},{"id":"530269","text":"Sleat is a peninsula on the island of Skye in the Highland council area of Scotland, known as \\"the garden of Skye\\".

He was among the last prominent members of the Whig Party in Maine before it collapsed in favor of the Republicans. He is the only Maine governor to have been elected to two non-consecutive terms (1838–39 and 1841–42), though his second term was through direct appointment by the Whig- dominated legislature. Kent graduated from Harvard in 1821, in the same class as Ralph Waldo Emerson. According to a biographical article reprinted in the New York Times, \\"he had no rank in college and in truth was President of the 'Lazy Club'. He apprenticed as a lawyer in Topsham, Maine, but established his own practice in the growing lumber-port of Bangor in 1825. He was elected to the Maine Legislature in 1829 and held political offices on and off the rest of his life, becoming the 2nd Mayor of Bangor (1836–37), then Governor, and then U.S. Consul in Rio de Janeiro (1849–53). Tragedy struck him in Rio when two of his three children, along with his wife Sarah Johnston (the daughter of Nathaniel Johnston of Hillsborough, NH) died of yellow fever. His surviving child died soon after they returned to Bangor.

Kent ended his public life as an Associate Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court (1859–73). His law partner and neighbor Jonas Cutting served almost concurrently in the same position (1854–75). Kent's uncle Prentiss Mellen had been the first Chief Justice of the same court. Kent played a part in both instigating and resolving the Aroostook War. Fort Kent, situated where the Fish River meets the Saint John River in the Saint John River Valley, was named in his honor. Later, the town of Fort Kent, Maine was named for the military installation (of which only a single blockhouse survives) and for Governor Kent.

The photograph, taken and marketed by AP during the Second Intifada in 2000, was published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and other newspapers worldwide, along with the fact-twisting caption provided by AP, gave the impression that the Israeli police officer had brutally beaten a Palestinian. ==Attack== On the eve of Rosh Hashana 2000, Grossman, a student from Chicago enrolled at Yeshivas Bais Yisroel from the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov (a neighborhood of Jerusalem), hailed a taxi with two friends to visit the Western Wall. When the driver took a shortcut through the Arab neighborhood of Wadi al-Joz, a mob of about 40 Arabs surrounded the taxi, smashed the windows, and dragged Grossman out, whereupon they beat him. The mob kicked him repeatedly, stabbed him once in the leg, and then pounded his head with rocks. Grossman managed to run to a nearby gas station, where he collapsed, and an Israeli policeman, wielding a club protected him, threatening the mob.Victim of the Media War by Tuvia Grossman on Aish HaTorah This was when the infamous picture was taken, by a freelance photographer who was at the gas station, of Grossman bleeding and crouched under the policeman, who is shouting and waving his club. ==News coverage== At the outset of the Second Intifada on September 30, 2000, the New York Times and other media outlets published an Associated Press photo of a bloodied Grossman crouching beneath a club-wielding Israeli Border Police officer. The caption under the photo simply identified the two as: \\"an Israeli policeman and a Palestinian.\\"The Photo that Started it All by Honest Reporting, October 20, 2000 The victim's true identity was revealed when Dr. Aaron Grossman of Chicago, the father of Tuvia Grossman, sent the following letter to the Times: > Regarding your picture on page A5 of the Israeli soldier and the Palestinian > on the Temple Mount -- that Palestinian is actually my son, Tuvia Grossman, > a Jewish student from Chicago. He, and two of his friends, were pulled from > their taxicab while traveling in Jerusalem, by a mob of Palestinian Arabs, > and were severely beaten and stabbed. That picture could not have been taken > on the Temple Mount because there are no gas stations on the Temple Mount > and certainly none with Hebrew lettering, like the one clearly seen behind > the Israeli soldier attempting to protect my son from the mob. In response, The New York Times published a correction on October 4, stating that: > A picture caption on Saturday about fighting between Israelis and > Palestinians in Jerusalem included an erroneous identification from The > Associated Press for a wounded man shown with an Israeli policeman. He was > Tuvia Grossman of Chicago, an American student in Israel, not an > unidentified Palestinian. In some copies the caption also misidentified the > site where Mr. Grossman was wounded. It was in Jerusalem's Old City, but not > on the Temple Mount. In this correction, Tuvia Grossman is accurately identified as \\"an American student in Israel,\\" but it is not noted that he is Jewish and his beating is not described. The location is still misstated, this time as Jerusalem's Old City, while the true location was the Arab neighborhood of Wadi al-Joz. Three days later, on October 7, the Times published another correction, noting that: > A picture caption on Page A6 last Saturday about fighting in Jerusalem gave > an erroneous identification from The Associated Press for a wounded man > shown with an Israeli policeman. He was Tuvia Grossman of Chicago, an > American studying at a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem, not an unidentified > Palestinian.

Allegations of anti- Israel bias The picture led to widespread outrage from the American Jewish community. The outrage was caused not only by the picture, but by the first brief retraction - described by Honest Reporting as \\"half-hearted\\" - which failed to identify Grossman as a Jew, and completely left out the part about his beating at the hands of an Arab mob. As a result of the incident, the organization HonestReporting was founded. Allegations of excessive reaction Seth Ackerman of FAIR, a liberal media watchdog, posits that the response of pro-Israel media critics was excessive, as \\"no one alleged any deliberate falsification\\" by AP, adding that \\"the vast majority of injuries in Jerusalem the day the Grossman photograph was taken were sustained by Palestinians\\". According to Ackerman seven to eight U.S. newspapers picked up the photo along with the original erroneous caption. The Associated Press acknowledged the error and set about correcting it, along with almost all of the newspapers that printed the photograph. The New York Times published two retractions (one on October 4, 2000 and another three days later) as well as a 670-word news article tracing the incident from the time the photograph was taken to when it was published. > \\"Newspapers across the country carried angry commentaries and letters by > supporters of Israel brandishing the mislabeled photograph as palpable proof > of their long-held suspicions.

Mount Tumbledown, Mount William and Sapper Hill lie west of the Falkland Islands capital Stanley and due to their proximity to the capital, were of strategic importance during the 1982 War. They were held by the Argentine 5th Naval Infantry Battalion (BIM 5), a reinforced, cold weather trained and equipped, Marine battalion. The assaulting British forces were the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards, 42 Commando, Royal Marines Mortar platoon and four light tanks of the Blues and Royals. The 1st Battalion, 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles were held in reserve. One of a number of night battles that took place during the British advance towards Stanley, the battle led to British troops capturing all the heights above the town, allowing its capture and the surrender of the Argentine forces on the islands. ==Overview== On the night of 13–14 June 1982 the British launched an assault on Mount Tumbledown, one of the highest points near the town of Stanley, the capital, and succeeded in driving Argentinian forces from the mountain. This close- quarters night battle was later dramatized in the BBC drama Tumbledown. The attacking British forces consisted of the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards (2SG), mortar detachments from 42 Commando, Royal Marines and the 1st Battalion, 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles (1/7 GR), as well as support from a troop of the Blues and Royals equipped with two Scorpion and two Scimitar armoured vehicles. The Argentinian forces defending the mountains were Commander Carlos Robacio's 5th Marine Infantry Battalion (BIM 5). In Argentine shelling directed by Marine Second Lieutenant Marcelo De Marco of the 5th Marines from his observation post on Tumbledown Mountain, four members of the Third Battalion, the Parachute Regiment and one REME craftsman had been killed on Mount Longdon and another seven paratroopers wounded. Prior to the British landings, the Argentinian marine battalion had been brought up to brigade strength by a company of the Amphibious Engineers Company (CKIA), a heavy machine-gun company of the Headquarters Battalion (BICO), a battery of the 1st Marine Field Artillery Battalion (BIAC), and three Tigercat SAM/Hispano-Suiza 30mm anti-aircraft gun batteries of the 1st Marine Anti-Aircraft Regiment, as well as a 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion platoon, a 3rd Marine Infantry Battalion platoon, a military police platoon and a canine platoon. As part of the British plan, 1/7 GR was given the task of capturing the sub-hill of Mount William held by O Company, the 5th Marine Battalion's reserve, and then allowing the Welsh Guards through to seize Sapper Hill, the final obstacle before Stanley. The attack was supported by naval gunfire from HMS Active's 4.5 inch gun. At the time of the battle, Marine Teniente de Navio (Ship-of- the-Line Lieutenant) Eduardo Villarraza's N Company held Mount Tumbledown. Mount William was just south of Tumbledown and the Marine battalion's O Company under Marine Captain Ricardo Quiroga was on its lower slopes. Major Oscar Ramon Jaimet's B (Bravo) Company, 6th Army Regiment was in reserve behind N Company. Marine Captain Rodolfo Oscar Cionchi's M Company occupied Sapper Hill. The Argentinian defenders held firm under the British 'softening up' bombardment, which began at 7:30 local time. Major Jaimet later recalled: > I heard the cries of the wounded calling for their comrades, twelve men > wounded before nightfall. We thought we had suffered before, but what luxury > and comfort compared to this.Razor's Edge, Hugh Bicheno, p. 288, Phoenix, > 2007 During the battle, the 5th Marines Command Post took five direct hits, but Commander Robacio emerged unscathed.(The Sinking of the Belgrano, Arthur Gavshon and Desmond Rice pg. 47) ==Tumbledown defenders== Captain Eduardo Villarraza's N Company from the 5th Marine Battalion, would defend Mounts Tumbledown and William. * The 1st Platoon, under by Marine Second Lieutenant (Guardiamarina or Midshipman) Carlos Bianchi, was dug in on Mount William. * The 2nd Platoon, led by Marine Second Lieutenant Marcelo Oruezabala, was dug in between Tumbledown and William. * The 3rd Platoon, under Marine Sergeant (Suboficial or Chief Petty Officer) Jorge Lucero, was dug in on the northern slopes of Tumbledown, overlooking Moody Brook. * The 4th Platoon, led by Sub- Lieutenant Carlos Daniel Vázquez, was dug in near the summit of Tumbledown, covering the western approaches to the peak. * The 5th Platoon, led by Lieutenant Héctor Omar Miño, was positioned behind the 4th Platoon, facing north in support of Lucero's men. * Browning 12.7mm heavy machine gun teams and German Shepherd Dog squads (from the Puerto Belgrano-based Headquarters Battalion) were also present on Mount Tumbledown and Sapper Hill. * Marine Tigercat Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) launchers and Anti-Tank gun and missile teams were also part of the defences, with one anti-tank team located on Mount William in support of Bianchi's men and another anti-tank team supporting Lucero's men. The Marine SAM Platoon equipped with British Blowpipe and Russian SA-7 shoulder-launched missiles were positioned on Sapper Hill. * The 60mm Mortar Platoon was split in two parts on Tumbledown, with the mortar men positioned near the summit (under Marine Sergeants David Ramos and Lucio Monzón) in support of Vázquez's 4th Platoon. ==Early moves== On the morning of 13 June, the Scots Guards were moved by helicopter from their position at Bluff Cove to an assembly area near Goat Ridge, west of Mount Tumbledown. The British plan called for a diversionary attack south of Mount Tumbledown by a small number of the Scots Guards, assisted by the four light tanks of the Blues and Royals, whilst the main attack came as a three-phase silent advance from the west of Mount Tumbledown. In the first phase, G company would take the western end of the mountain. In the second phase, Left Flank (company) would pass through the area taken by G company to capture the centre of the summit. In the third phase, Right Flank would pass through Left Flank to secure the eastern end of Tumbledown. A daytime assault was initially planned, but was postponed at the British battalion commander's request. In a meeting with his company commanders the consensus was that the long uphill assault across the harsh ground of Tumbledown would be suicidal in daylight. ==Diversion== At 8:30 p.m. on 13 June the diversionary attack began. The 2nd Bn Scots Guards' Reconnaissance Platoon, commanded by Major Richard Bethell (a former SAS officer), and supported by four light tanks of the 'Blues & Royals', clashed with the Argentine O Marine Company under Marine Captain Quiroga in a blocking position on the lower slopes of Mount William. On William's southern slopes, one of the tanks was taken out of action by a booby trap. The initial advance was unopposed, but a heavy firefight broke out when British troops made contact with Argentinian defences. The Argentinians opened fire, killing two British soldiers and wounding four others. After two hours of hard fighting, the company withdrew to its main defences on William and the British secured the position. Marine First Class Private José Luis Fazio fought against Bethell's force: > At about 2230 hours our battalion had its first intensive gun battle with > British companies which appeared out of nowhere. I heard Private Roberto > Barboza yell \\"The English are here!\\" ... I remember our Operations Officer > requested the artillery to assist at 23.00 with star shells. The close > quarter battle was such that the Argentine artillery was unable to drop > shells on to the British attackers. I was shooting, doing my work. I don't > know if I killed anyone. We just fired our rifles, that's all. Contact was > maintained for over an hour before battalion headquarters ordered Obra > Company to fall back ... What we did not realise at the time was that at > least a wounded Marine made his way to the amphibious engineer platoon > position and hurled a grenade wounding a Major. Simultaneously the Major > opened fire, killing him.Nick van der Bijl, Victory in the Falklands, p.199, > Pen and Sword, 2007 Fearing a counter-attack, the British platoon withdrew into an undetected minefield, and were forced to abandon their dead.http://www.britainssmallwars.com/Falklands/Tumbledown.htm Two men were wounded covering the withdrawal and four more were wounded by mines. The explosions prompted the Argentine Marine Major Antonio Pernías to order the 81 mm mortar platoon on Mount William and the longer-ranged 120 mm mortars attached to 'C' Company, 3rd Infantry Regiment on Sapper Hill to open fire on the minefield and the likely withdrawal route of anyone attacking Mount William.Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.190, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 The barrage lasted for about forty minutes and more British casualties would have been inflicted if the mortar bombs had not landed on soft peat, which absorbed most of the power of the explosions. In 2007, Guardsmen Steven William Duffy and Peter Alexander MacInnes from the Pipes & Drums Platoon recounted their experiences, claiming that some Argentinian Marines were in hot pursuit during the British withdrawal, with Bethell's force suffering a total of 2 killed and 16 wounded.2SG Tumbledown Falklands ==Night attack== Final Actions, 13 to 14 June 1982. At 9 p.m., half an hour after the start of the diversionary attack, Major Iain Dalzel-Job's G Company started its advance of nearly two miles. Reaching its objective undetected, the company found the western end of the mountain undefended and occupied it easily, but later came under heavy shellfire that wounded Major Dalzel-Job in the head. Major John Kiszely's Left Flank passed through them and reached the central region of the peak unopposed, but then came under heavy fire.Patrick Bishop and John Witherow, The Winter War: Falklands Conflict, p. 133 The Argentinians, later learned to be of company strength, directed mortar, grenade, machine gun and small arms fire from very close range at the British company, killing three British soldiers. Marine Sub-Lieutenant Héctor Mino's 5th Platoon (1st Amphibious Engineer Company), held the rocks behind Sub- Lieutenant Carlos Vázquez's 4th Platoon, N Company. In the centre of the 4th Marine Platoon position were the remnants of Second Lieutenants Óscar Silva's and Marcelo Llambías-Pravaz's RI 4 platoons as well as the remnants of Second Lieutenants Celestino Mosteirín's and Marcelo Dorigón's RI 12 platoons, which had recently fought on Two Sisters, Goat Ridge and Mount Harriet. For four or five hours, a mixed bag of Marine/Army defenders representing six platoons of Argentinian infantry, engineers and one platoon of mortar men on Tumbledown pinned the British down. To help identify the bunkers, the Guardsmen fired flares at the summit. The Guardsmen traded 66 mm rockets and 84 mm anti-tank rounds with the Argentinians, who were armed with anti-tank rifle grenades and protected in their rock bunkers. The Argentinians refused to budge; the Guardsmen could hear some of them shouting obscene phrases in English and even singing the March of the Malvinas as they fought. Meanwhile, two Royal Navy frigates, HMS Yarmouth and Active, were pounding Tumbledown with their 4.5 inch guns. At one stage Lieutenant Colonel Michael Scott, (Commanding Officer of 2 SG), thought the battalion might have to withdraw and attack again the next night, \\"The old nails were being bitten a bit, if we had been held on Tumbledown it might have encouraged them to keep on fighting\\". === Left flank === The fighting was hard going for Left Flank. The Argentinians had well dug- in machine guns and snipers. At 2:30 a.m., however, a second British assault overwhelmed the men of the 4th and 12th Regiments but the survivors of Vazquez's 4th Platoon would continue fighting till about 7:00 am. The British troops swarmed over the mountaintop and killed, wounded or captured several of the RI 4 and RI 12 defenders, at times fighting with fixed bayonets. Marine Private Jorge Sanchez recalled: > The fighting was sporadic, but at times fierce, as we tried to maintain our > position. By this time we had ten or twelve dead including one officer > [Second Lieutenant Oscar Silva, Argentine Army]. I hadn't fired directly at > a British soldier, as they had been too hard to get a clear shot at. I can > remember lying there with all this firing going over my head. They were > everywhere. The platoon commander [Marine Sub-Lieutenant Carlos Daniel > Vazquez] then called Private Ramon Rotela manning the 60 millimetre mortar > and Rotela fired it straight up into the air so that the bombs landed on > ourselves. At this point I had been up and in actual combat for over six > hours. It was snowing and we were tired. Some of the guys had surrendered, > but I didn't want to do this. I had only twenty rounds left and I decided to > continue the fight from Mount William. I popped up, fired a rifle grenade in > the direction of 8 to 10 British soldiers to keep their heads down, and then > ran for the 2nd Platoon. I can remember saying some type of prayer hoping > the British wouldn't shoot me in the back.Nick van der Bijl, Victory in the > Falklands, pp. 208–209, Pen and Sword, 2007 Major Kiszely, who was to become a senior general after the war, was the first man into the 4th Platoon position, personally shooting two Argentinian conscripts and bayoneting a third, his bayonet breaking in two. Seeing their company commander among the Argentinians inspired 14 and 15 Platoons to make the final dash across open ground to get within bayoneting distance of the remaining 4th Platoon Marines. Kiszely and six other Guardsmen suddenly found themselves standing on top of the mountain, looking down on Stanley which was under street lighting and vehicles could be seen moving along the roads. The Argentinians, in the form of Second Lieutenant Augusto La Madrid's platoon from Major Jaimet's B Company and Marine Lieutenant Hector Miño's amphibious engineer platoon (rallied by Marine Lieutenant Waldemar Aquino and Marine Second Lieutenant De Marco), now counter-attacked and a burst of machine gun fire from La Madrid's men wounded three Guardsmen, including Lieutenant Alasdair Mitchell (commander of 15 Platoon). A bullet also passed through the compass secured on the belt of the Left Flank Company commander, injuring Major Kiszely. For his bayonet charge Kiszely was awarded the Military Cross. According to Guardsman Mark Cape, another three Guardsmen defending the summit were also wounded in this action, when Miño, De Marco and Privates Oscar Poltronieri and Carlos Muela attacked their position with hand grenades.Apasionante documental sobre la Guerra de Malvinas ==Counterattack== By 6 a.m., Left Flank's attack had clearly stalled and had cost the British company seven men killed and 18 wounded. On the eastern half of the mountain the platoons of conscripts of La Madrid and Miño platoon, were attempting to renew their advance, having already wounded six Guardsmen, so Colonel Scott ordered Right Flank to push on to clear the final positions. Second Lieutenant La Madrid later described the fighting: > I went forward to make a reconnaissance and could see that the British had > two machineguns and a missile launcher in action. I went through another gap > in the rocks and was surprised by three men speaking in English behind and > above me and firing over the top of me. I could see them with my night > binoculars ... I took a rifle grenade and fired at where I had seen the > first three men. I heard it explode and some shouts and cries of pain ... I > ran back to my position and ordered my men to open fire. We stopped them, > but they thinned out and came round our flanks ... They also engaged us with > light mortars and missile launchers. This went on for a long time, and we > suffered heavy casualties ... We started to run short of ammunition ... > Also, I could see that we were outflanked, with the British behind us, so we > were cut off from my company ... I reorganized and found that I was down to > sixteen men. I started to retire ... I left six men in a line with one > machinegun to cover our retreat, but really we were fighting all the time; > we could not break contact. They came on us fast, and we fell back ... We > eventually got through to Stanley, through what I would like to say was a > perfect barrage fired by the Royal Artillery. We had to wait for breaks in > the firing, but I still lost a man killed there.The Fight for the Malvinas, > Martin Middlebrook, pp. 261–262, Viking, 1989 Major Simon Price sent 2 and 3 Platoons forward, preceded by a barrage of 66 mm rockets to clear the Argentine reinforcements. Major Price placed 1 Platoon high up in the rocks to provide fire support for the assault troops. Lieutenant Robert Lawrence led 3 Platoon around to the right of the Argentinian platoons, hoping to take the Argentinians by surprise. They were detected, however, and the British were briefly pinned down by gunfire before a bayonet charge overwhelmed the Argentinian defenders. Lance-Corporal Graham Rennie of 3 Platoon later described the British attack: > Our assault was initiated by a Guardsman killing a sniper, which was > followed by a volley of 66 mm anti-tank rounds. We ran forward in extended > line, machine-gunners and riflemen firing from the hip to keep the enemy > heads down, enabling us to cover the open ground in the shortest possible > time. Halfway across the open ground 2 Platoon went to ground to give > covering fire support, enabling us to gain a foothold on the enemy position. > From then on we fought from crag to crag, rock to rock, taking out pockets > of enemy and lone riflemen, all of whom resisted fiercely.5th Infantry > Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, page 200, > Leo Cooper, 2003 As La Madrid and Miño withdrew after suffering reportedly five killed in the Argentine counterattack,Oscar Luis Jofre and Félix Roberto Aguiar, Malvinas: La Defensa de Puerto Argentino, page 262, Editorial Sudamericana, 1987 the platoons under Second Lieutenant Aldo Franco and Guillermo Robredo moved in from the eastern edge of the mountain to try to help La Madrid and Miño. Advancing out of the central region of Tumbledown Mountain, the British again came under heavy fire from the Argentinians, but by advancing in pairs under covering fire, they succeeded in clearing those Bravo Company platoons as well, gaining firm control of the mountain's eastern side. Right Flank had achieved this at the cost of five wounded, including Lieutenant Lawrence. However, Left Flank had lost two men killed and several wounded during the Argentine counterattack, when mortar fire controllers on Mount William targeted British wounded and stretcher bearers in error.\\"A small counter- attack did now take place, but was driven off, but not without further casualties, including a mortar bomb which killed two stretcher-bearers tending to the wounded.\\" For Love of Regiment, Charles Messenger, p. 206, Pen & Sword, 1994 In his moment of victory on the eastern slopes, Lawrence was almost killed when a bullet fired by an Argentine stay-behind sniper tore off the side of his head. He was awarded the Military Cross for bravery, but he spent a year in a wheelchair and was almost totally paralyzed. The Argentinian sniper (in fact Private Luis Jorge Bordón or Walter Ignacio Becerra, according to La Madridhttp://www.lanacion.com.ar/1362425-un-heroe-todos-los-heroes Un héroe, todos los héroes lanacion.com, 03/04/2011), armed with a FAL rifle, had helped cover the Argentinean retreat, firing shots at a Scout helicopter evacuating wounded off Tumbledown and wounding two men (including Guardsman Kenny Mains). The Scots Guards eventually mortally wounded him in a hail of gunfire, but not before the Argentine soldier generated more confusion, resulting in the wounding of the Forward Observation Officer (FOO, Captain Swinton) attached to the Gurkhas, while clearing the positions of Marine Sergeant Jorge Lucero's 3rd Platoon before advancing on to take Mount William. ==Fall of Tumbledown== By 9:00 a.m., the Scots Guards had gained the high ground east of Tumbledown Mountain and the Gurkhas commenced deploying across the heavily shelled saddle from Tumbledown south to Mount William, which they took with the loss of 8 wounded. The 2nd Battalion Scots Guards had lost eight dead and 43 wounded. The Welsh Guards had lost one dead, the Royal Engineers had also lost one dead, and the Gurkhas had sustained altogether 13 wounded, including the artillery observation officer, Captain Keith Swinton. According to Dhanbahadur Rai, a Gurkha: > The Scots Guards were to attack Tumbledown, with the Gurkhas following > behind. We were supposed to finish the attack and they would give us > covering fire from Tumbledown ... During the night we followed the Scots > Guards and then our CO told us to stop.

The bodies of 30 Argentine Army and Marine soldiers were found in and around the 5th Marine Battalion perimeter. Reaching the rear positions of N Marine Company, Second Lieutenant Franco took the time to set free several German Shepherds left behind in the Argentine retreat from Tumbledown. During the battle, Guardsman Philip Williams was knocked unconscious by an explosion, and left for dead. When he came to, the rest of the British soldiers had gone. Williams' parents were informed that he had died and a memorial service was held for him. After seven weeks he found his way back to civilization, to find himself accused of desertion by the media and fellow soldiers.Philip Williams and M. S. Power, Summer Soldier, Bloomsbury, 1991. (cover notes) ==Last stand on Sapper HillRelevant deployments=== The 5th Marine Battalion's M Company (under Marine Captain ) and supporting Tigercat SAM launchers and Hispano Suiza 30 mm guns from the 1st Marine Anti-Aircraft Battalion were stationed along the Sapper Hill slopes, with part of the Puerto Belgrano-based Marine Dog Platoon (under Sub-Lieutenant Miguel Paz) providing extra security in the form of 5 canines (Ñaro, Nego, Vogel, Warner and XuaviaLa historia de los perros de Malvinas ) and their handlers and accompanying riflemen. The bulk of the 5th Marine Battalion was deployed on Mounts Tumbledown and William. In all 18 German Shepherds under Sub-Lieutenant Paz would be deployed in and around the Falklands capital. Also present on Sapper Hill were the 155mm artillery guns from the 101st Artillery Group, the 120mm Heavy Mortar Platoon from Captain Ramón Alberto Varela's C Company and the Reconnaissance Platoon (under Lieutenant Norman Osvaldo Reynoso) from the 3rd General Manuel Belgrano Mechanized Infantry Regiment. An Air Force mobile Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 long-range radar was positioned on Sapper Hill in April and reportedly detected the British landings at Fitzroy on 7 June.\\"British Triumph On East Falkland\\" The next day, Skyhawk fighter-bombers attacked the British troopships Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram with bombs. On 1 May, Private Daniel Cabiglioli from M Company was killed during the Royal Navy bombardment of Sapper Hill.\\"1º de Mayo \\" The Westinghouse radar positioned on the hill was also damaged in the naval shelling and would remain out of service for several days.\\"En la madrugada del día 31, dos ataques aéreos con aviones Vulcan y Harrier sobre las posiciones del RI 3, del RI 25 y la zona del aeropuerto, pusieron fuera de servicio, transitoriamente, el radar de vigilancia de la Fuerza Aérea.\\" Félix Roberto Aguiar and Francisco Cervo, Operaciones terrestres en las Islas Malvinas, p. 216, Círculo Militar, 1985 That night, a five-man squad under Sergeant Miguel Angel Martinez from the 3rd Regiment Recce Platoon discovered an abandoned rubber boat while patrolling near Sapper Hill. The next day, the 1st Assault Section under First Lieutenant José Martiniano Duarte from the 601st Commando Company, checked the boat for hidden explosives and brought it back to Port Stanley for closer examination.\\"Fue destacada para su reconocimiento la primera sección del teniente primero José M. Duarte, la cual desde temprano esperó en el antiguo cuartel de los Royal Marines, en Moody Brook, que las condiciones meteorológicas permitieran la salida de los helicópteros asignados a la operación. Llegados al lugar, se pudo comprobar la exactitud del aviso: sobre la playa había un bote neumático en posición invertida.\\" Isidoro Ruiz-Moreno, Comandos en acción: El Ejército en Malvinas, Editorial San Martín, 1987 In June, Lieutenant Reynoso's Recce Platoon reportedly exchanged small arms fire with a British patrol (possibly G Squadron from the SAS that had commandeered a yacht at Bluff Cove Settlement to operate behind Tumbledown\\"A patrol from G Squadron SAS commandeered a civilian yacht at Bluff Cove, had its engine repaired by army engineers and sailed east along the coast in broad daylight. Finally, they beached their craft within 2 miles of the Argentine positions on Mount Tumbledown. An enemy helicopter flew overhead without opening fire, and the bewildered Argentinians took no offensive action against the SAS party for two days, during which G Squadron called down artillery fire onto the back of Tumbledown.\\" Max Hastings, Simon Jenkins, The Battle for the Falklands, Pan, 1987 and had also sent men forward in a helicopter\\"Then some days later, a helicopter dropped in at battalion HQ containing an SAS patrol commanded by Corporal Nobby Noble of G Squadron, 22 SAS, and formerly of the Grenadier Guards. Nobby knew what we were up to and had dropped in to tell us that he was going to take his patrol forward by helicopter that night and establish an observation post at Port Harriet House.\\" Tim Spicer, An Unorthodox Soldier: Peace and War and the Sandline Affair, p. 88, Mainstream, 1999) infiltrated near Sapper Hill, prior to the final land battles. On 7 June, a British Harrier bombing the Sapper Hill positions was claimed hit by concentrated fire from M Company. According to Private José Luis Fazio: No Harriers were shot down on 7 June. On June 12, Harrier XW919 was hit by shrapnel, possibly from a Tigercat missile, and seriously damaged while dropping CBUs on an artillery position near Sapper Hill. During the recovery, the aircraft caught fire on Hermes flight deck, owing to a fractured reaction pipe.\\"During the attack, Macleod's aircraft was hit by shrapnel which penetrated the rear equipment bay area of the aircraft and fractured the aft reaction control air pipe. On decelerating to the hover during the recovery, this caused a fire to start in the rear equipment bay and smoke as seen coming from the aircraft. Fuel indications suggested a considerable fuel leak at the same time. MacLeod executed a very quick and professional landing in worrying circumstances. Having landed-on, the fire was extinguished by the ground crew.\\" RAF diaries, 12 June entry Argentine sources claim that the aircraft was hit by AAA immediately after the attack. A 155 mm howitzer was lightly damaged and six soldiers injured.En uno de esos ataques -12 de Junio- el enemigo en vuelo rasante (150 mts. del suelo) descargó todos sus cohetes sobre el cañón: resultaron seis heridos leves y fue \\"tocado\\" por la propia artillería antiaérea; uno de los sirvientes descargó sobre la máquina enemiga su fusil FAL; el cañón continuó en servicio. Rodríguez Mottino, p. 91 The Harrier had extensive repairs and, though still operational, it was ultimately transferred to the SFDO (School of Flight Deck Operations) at Culdrose, and was eventually donated to the Polish Aviation Museum of Kraków.www.muzeumlotnictwa.pl On 13 June, a messenger in the Welsh Guards was killed when his motorbike ran over a mine while bringing forward food supplies to Major Christopher Drewrywe's Number 2 Company (1WG).\\"A motorcycle messenger in the Welsh Guards was killed when he ran his bike over a mine after bringing rations up to the front line.\\" Patrick Bishop and John Witherow, The Winter War, Quartet, 1982 ===Last Stand=== After first light on 14 June, Major Phillip Neame's D Company of 2 PARA in the final stages of the Battle of Wireless Ridge reported seeing hundreds of Argentinians regrouping on Sapper Hill.\\"I had been trying to get fire missions down on the retreating closely-packed formation of troops but was told that there was no artillery available. I was going quite spare because I was supposed to have two batteries at my priority call. Here was a golden opportunity being missed. I assumed the enemy was withdrawing to regroup on Sapper Hill and the last thing I wanted was another major battle. Eventually, we got the artillery and started blasting away with everything else we had as well. But as soon as we opened up we got very accurate artillery fire back at our own position. I guessed that they were adjusting onto our muzzle flashes so I told all the company to stop firing with their small arms. I decided that the only thing was to keep fighting this battle with artillery, otherwise, we were just going to have a lot of shit knocked out of ourselves.\\" Max Arthur, Above All, Courage: The Falklands Front Line, page 202, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1985 Argentine artillery and Second Lieutenant La Madrid 6th Regiment platoon was still in action, firing on Neame's company and losing another two killed (Privates Horacio Echave and Horacio Balvidares\\"Monte Tumbledown: la batalla final\\") on Sapper Hill. While taking up new positions on Sapper Hill, Sergeant Víctor Hugo Juárez from 5th Marine Battalion HQs, Private Vicente Antonio Díaz from the 1st Amphibious Engineers Company and Private Ricardo Ramírez from the 81mm Mortar Platoon on Mount William are also killed in the fierce British bombardment and long-range retaliatory machinegun and small-arms fire from Neame's company on Wireless Ridge. On the night of the 13/14 June, the Welsh Guards/Royal Marine Battalion were on standby to help in the British attacks on Mounts Tumbledown and William. Their orders were to move towards Sapper Hill only after these objectives were taken. During the advance, they became bogged down in a minefield, which took them a very long and frustrating time to extract themselves from, after coming under fire from heavy mortars on Sapper Hill. Meanwhile, the men of the 1st Battalion 7th Gurkha Rifles had been spotted and shelled from Argentine mortar fire controllers and artillery officers on Sapper Hill, suffering eight wounded.\\"In the gloomy dawn, Captain Villarraza's Forward Observation Officer on Sapper Hill, Second Lieutenant Marcelo De Marco, radioed 3rd Artillery Group for airburst, which wounded eight Gurkhas.\\" Nick van der Bijl, Victory in the Falklands, p 218, Pen & Sword, 2007 Earlier on, a Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre patrol under Sergeant David Lazenby had penetrated the frozen minefield to secure a landing zone for the British helicopters. Major Drewrywe's Welsh Guards eventually reached the base of Sapper Hill, only to discover that the Argentine M Company was still in position. The Guardsmen were forced to withdraw, protected by the early morning fog, this time avoiding the minefield.\\"After some time an explosion was heard. A Royal Marine had stepped on a mine, followed by another a few minutes later. Our troop then cleared a safe line through the minefield. Once through, we dug in at the base of a hill, only to find that it was still occupied by Argentine troops. So back we went to our original positions, this time around the minefield.\\" J. M. Kneen and D. J. Sutton, Craftsmen of the Army: The Story of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (Vol II 1969–1992, Volumes 1969–1992), p. 449, Pen & Sword, 1997 Due to this delay, it was decided that 45 Commando should move forward from Two Sisters to occupy Sapper Hill. While 45 Commando were marching towards Sapper Hill, Alpha and Charlie Companies from 40 Commando had escaped from the attention of the Argentine defenders on Sapper Hill and they were picked up by helicopters. They were eventually landed on the slopes of Sapper Hill just as 45 Commando were approaching, so both units attacked and captured the hill. ===Argentine Retreat=== Unwilling to abandon Tumbledown, Commander Carlos Robacio on Sapper Hill was planning to counter-attack and drive back the Guardsmen. Only the personal intervention of Colonel Félix Aguiar, the 10th Brigade Chief of Staff, brought the fighting to an end.Oscar Luis Jofre and Félix Roberto Aguiar, Malvinas: La Defensa de Puerto Argentino, page 275, Editorial Sudamericana, 1987 The 5th Marines worked their way back into Stanley, leaving the 2nd Platoon of Marine Second Lieutenant Marcelo Davis and 3rd Platoon of Marine Second Lieutenant Alejandro Koch of M Company to cover the retreat. The Argentine Marine companies withdrew safely, although pursued by artillery fire and hit by a laser-guided bomb dropped by Flight Lieutenant Mark Hare in XZ133 killing two of the Marine canines, Negro and Ñaro. Argentine Panhard armoured cars were moved forward to the edge of Stanley to cover the retreating troops.Un ejemplo de opreración conjunta: Hércules y Panhard Marine Privates Roberto Leyes, Eleodoro Monzón and Sergio Ariel from M Company were killed protecting the Argentine retreat. Six Royal Marines were wounded by mines and small-arms fireMarine Vince Comb, seventeen and a half years old and the youngest man in the troop, was the machine gunner and was hit by bullets in the wrist and arm. He was immediately replaced on the machine gun and two Royal Marines gave him morphine and first aid.

Lieutenant Bushby radioed for help, but he was using a trailing antenna, as opposed to a whip aerial, and was unsuccessful.

The Royal Marines in Second Lieutenant Carl Bushby's 9 Troop protecting the landing zone successfully defended their position when the Argentine Marines under Davis launched a counter-attack, the last one of the ground campaign.\\"An Argentine attack on the Royal Marines right flank was driven back ... The firing gradually slowed down and the Argentines simply evacuated Sapper Hill, as the Royal Marines very slowly got to their feet.\\" Nick van der Bijl, Victory in the Falklands, Pen & Sword, 2007\\"Cuando le ordené al guardiamarina Davis: \\"¡Listo, nos vamos !\\", él todavía estaba pensando en el contraataque, y salió disparando hacia el frente, o sea al revés ... Es que Davis y sus hombres estaban listos para largar el contraataque. Fue impresionante su actitud ofensiva.\\" Malvinas: 20 años, 20 héroes, p. 328, Fundación Soldados, 2002 Two parked British Sea Kings within range from Koch's Marines sustained minor damage from Sergeant Miguel Angel Vaca's machine-gun and rifle-grenades fired by Corporal Carlos Jorge Sini, but both remained operational. At the foot of the hill, there was an enormous minefield. Lieutenant Paul Allen and Marine Wayne McGregor of 7 Troop were both wounded activating anti-personnel mines. A group of Sappers from Condor Troop went ahead to clear a path through the mines, losing Sergeant Peter Thorpe badly wounded in the process. Tanks of the Blues & Royals moved forward, to provide covering fire if necessary. During the helicopter evacuations of the wounded, Captain Sam Drennan of No. 656 Squadron would win the Distinguished Flying Cross for rescuing a wounded Gurkha and Guardsman from the middle of a minefield. However, when the Royal Marines and Welsh Guardsmen advanced they found Sapper Hill abandoned. The delay caused by the mines probably saved many lives.\\"Robacio, who came in for criticism from some British officers ... had total command of N Company and the Army platoons involved, and deserves credit for doing all that was possible to limit British gains ... His positioning of heavy weapons on Sapper Hill before the Argentine surrender provided a defensive barrier that would only have been breached at heavy cost in men and equipment.\\" Nick van der Bijl, Victory in the Falklands, p. 211 The Argentine Marine companies had been deeply entrenched and were well equipped with heavy machine guns.

Men from 9 Para Squadron, Royal Engineers, were awarded two Military Medals and Captain Sam Drennan, the Army Air Corps Scout pilot who had picked up the injured soldiers under fire and a former Scots Guards NCO, received the Distinguished Flying Cross. Carlos Robacio, BIM5 commander, was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal and the battalion itself was decorated by the Argentine Congress in 2002.Honor al valor en combate y Batallón benemérito Due to his actions on both Two Sisters and Tumbledown, Private Oscar Ismael Poltronieri of La Madrid's platoon was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Heroic Valour in Combat Cross, Argentina's highest military decoration. He is the only conscript soldier in his nation's recent history who has received this honour.Middlebrook, Martin (1990). The fight for the \\"Malvinas\\": the Argentine forces in the Falklands War. Penguin books, p. 239. After the battle, Pipe Major James Riddell of 2 SG stood near the top of the mountain and played his bagpipes. He played a quick march he had composed \\"on the back of a fag packet\\" [cigarette pack] during the battle, following a long tradition in which Pipe Majors were encouraged \\"to write tunes to commemorate any actions in which their regiments have been engaged\\".Piping Times, Volume 55 No.1 (October 2002) includes a photo of P/M Riddell playing his bagpipes on top of Mount Tumbledown. Piping Times, Volume 55 No.2 (November 2002) contains a Riddell's handwritten copy of the music. He named the tune The Crags of Tumbledown Mountain. It was released as a single by the Pipes and Drums of 2SG a year later.The gramophone, Volume 60, Issue 2, page 1089, 1983 == Tumbledown after the war == The film Tumbledown, directed by Richard Eyre, premiered on 30 May 1988. It is based on the experiences of Lieutenant Robert Lawrence, who was severely wounded during the battle. The film won several awards including the RTS Television Award 1989 for best male actor for Colin Firth's performance in the role of Lieutenant Lawrence. In 2012, Argentine journalist Nicolas Kasanzew wrote a tango called \\"Carlos Daniel Vazquez's Thermopylae\\", which is sung by Carlos Longoni. A cross has been erected at the summit of the mountain as a memorial to the soldiers who died in the battle. Two British artists have depicted the battle in painting, Mark Churms and Terence Cuneo, the latter commissioned by the Scots Guards. In the UK a Tumbledown Veterans And Families Association was created.

Published in 2000, it won the 2001 Whitbread Book of the Year award, the first children's novel to do so. It was named Children's Book of the Year at the 2001 British Book Awards, and was the first children's book to be longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. ==Plot== Mrs Coulter keeps her daughter Lyra drugged in a remote cave hidden from the Magisterium, a theocratic authority determined to kill Lyra to prevent her from causing a new fall of man. Lyra dreams she meets her dead friend Roger in the land of the dead, and promises to help him. In Cittàgazze, a city in a parallel world, angels Balthamos and Baruch are instructed to take Lyra's friend Will to Lord Asriel, whose army is preparing to fight the Magisterium, but Will refuses until Lyra is rescued. When they are attacked by a soldier of the archangel Metatron, Will uses the subtle knife, which has a blade so sharp it can cut windows into other worlds, to escape. Baruch delivers a message to Asriel, but dies from wounds sustained fighting angels loyal to Metatron. The Magisterium sends an assassin, Father Gomez, to follow the physicist Mary Malone, hoping that Mary will lead him to Lyra. Mary goes through another window into a world where she meets sapient, elephantine creatures called mulefa who use large seedpods attached to their feet as wheels. She learns that the seedpod trees have been dying out for centuries. Mary uses the tree sap lacquer to construct a spyglass that allows her to see the particles known as Dust, which is no longer nourishing the trees that the mulefa depend on. Will meets Iorek Byrnison, king of the armoured bears, who are migrating south to avoid the Arctic melt caused by Lord Asriel's experiments. Will impresses Iorek by destroying his helmet with the subtle knife, and Iorek agrees to help rescue Lyra. Will, Iorek, Balthamos, Asriel's army and Magisterium forces converge on Mrs Coulter's cave, where Will wakes Lyra. As he cuts a window into another world, Mrs Coulter's sudden arrival reminds him of his sick mother, which breaks his concentration, and he shatters the knife. He and two Gallivespian spies, Tialys and Salmakia, escape with Lyra to another world. Iorek repairs the knife. Lyra, Will, Tialys and Salmakia travel to the world of the dead to fulfil Lyra's promise to Roger. They are forced to leave their dæmons behind, causing them enormous pain. After they find Roger, they strike a deal with the harpies: in exchange for allowing them to open a window so the dead can escape, the harpies will hear the stories of the dead, and may bar access to those who have not lived full lives or do not tell the truth. The dead step through and dissolve, reunited with the universe.Oxford Botanic Garden featured in The Amber Spyglass and shown in a photograph in the sequel, Lyra's Oxford. Will and Lyra must return to Asriel's realm to retrieve their dæmons; Will's dæmon, previously invisible, is now visible. They are joined by the ghosts of Will's father and Lee Scoresby, who decide to remain intact to join Asriel's army and fight the spectres, wraith-like creatures that devour adult souls. The battle between Asriel's army and the forces of the Authority begins. Mrs Coulter, who has allied herself with Asriel, enters the Authority's citadel, where she meets the Regent Metatron. She leads Metatron to Asriel, but betrays him, uniting with Asriel to attack Metatron. All three fall into an abyss and cease to exist. Will and Lyra free the Authority from Metatron's crystal prison, but he is so feeble that the atmosphere dissolves him. With the help of the Gallivespians, armoured bears, and ghosts, Lyra and Will find their dæmons and escape to the mulefa world, where the short-lived Gallivespians die. They encounter Mary, who tells them why she stopped being a nun was because of love and the feeling of love. Listening to that, Lyra realises feelings she didn't know she had. This is how Mary plays the serpent to Lyra's Eve. Will and Lyra picnic in the wood and kiss. The flow of Dust escaping is slowed and envelops Will and Lyra. Balthamos prevents Father Gomez from killing Lyra and allows himself to disperse into the air. The witch Serafina Pekkala and angel Xaphania explain that openings between worlds allow Dust to escape into oblivion, each creating a new spectre; no more must be created and all the existing windows must be closed, except the one leading from the world of the dead. Lyra and Will must return to their own worlds, as they are unable to survive in worlds other than their own. Lyra leads Will to the Botanic Gardens in his Oxford. They promise to go to a bench in their respective Oxfords every midsummer's day to think of each other. \\"Lyra+Will\\" carved in the bench in the Oxford Botanic Garden. Will and Mary return to their world. Will deliberately breaks the subtle knife by trying to open a window while thinking about Lyra. Mary learns how to see her own dæmon, a black Alpine chough. Will's dæmon, named Kirjava by Serafina, has taken the permanent form of a large black cat. Lyra returns to Jordan College in her world. Having lost her ability to intuitively read her alethiometer, a truth- telling device, she decides to study alethiometry. She and her dæmon Pantalaimon, who has taken the permanent form of a pine marten, resolve to build the Republic of Heaven. ==Changes to US edition== Pullman's publishers have primarily marketed the His Dark Materials series to young adults, but Pullman also intended to speak to adults. The Amber Spyglass is partly a re- evaluation of the Biblical tale of Adam and Eve. Pullman said Lyra's sexual awakening \\"is exactly what happens in the Garden of Eden … Why the Christian Church has spent 2,000 years condemning this glorious moment, well, that's a mystery. I want to confront that, I suppose, by telling a story that this so- called original sin is anything but. It's the thing that makes us fully human.\\" The North American edition alters passages describing Lyra's incipient sexuality. The text in the UK edition includes this passage in the chapter \\"Marzipan\\": This is amended in the US edition to: Other passages have also been modified in the US edition. ==Chapter headings== Each chapter carried at the beginning a quotation from one of Pullman's favourite authors, including Milton (Paradise Lost), William Blake and Emily Dickinson. Before His Dark Materials first came out the publisher had asked Pullman to produce his customary drawings for the head of each chapter, his drawings first appeared in the Lantern Slide editions of the books. ==Critical reception== The Amber Spyglass won critical acclaim and became the first children's book to win the Whitbread Book of the Year. It also won the British Book Awards, Children's book of the year, American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults, Parents' Choice Good Book Award, Horn Book Fanfare Honor Book, New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age and ABC Children's Booksellers' Choice, and became a New York Times Bestseller. In 2019, it was ranked sixth in The Guardian's list of the 100 best books since 2000. ==References== * * ==External links== * Philip Pullman Author's website * HisDarkMaterials.com Publisher Random House's His Dark Materials website * Scholastic: His Dark Materials UK publisher's website * Randomhouse: His Dark Materials U.S. publisher's website * BBC Radio 4's His Dark Materials site inc.

He was of German and French ancestry. His father, a Frenchman, was a well known amateur violinist in Reims, and took a great interest in musical affairs. His mother, a Berliner, was an excellent pianist, who had studied under Clara Schumann. Through the influence of Camillo Sivori, Marteau's parents were easily persuaded to allow their son to adopt a musical career, and he showed remarkable aptitude in his studies, first under Bunzl, later under Hubert Léonard and from 1891 entered Jules Garcin's class at the Conservatoire de Paris. Marteau was remarkable both for his individuality and for his development. His debut was made when only ten years old, at a concert given by the Vienna Philharmonic Society, conducted by Hans Richter. A tour through Switzerland and Germany followed. A year later Charles Gounod selected this young violinist to play the obbligato of a piece, Vision de Jeanne d'Arc, composed for the Joan of Arc Centenary Celebration at Reims, where he also performed, before an audience of 2500 people, his teacher Léonard's Violin Concerto No. 5. Marteau made his professional debut in London in 1888, at a Richter concert. In 1892 he gained the first place prize at the Conservatoire de Paris, and Jules Massenet and Théodore Dubois both wrote a violin concerto especially for his benefit. A further series of tours followed. Twice he visited America, once in 1893, and once in 1898, and he visited Russia 1897-1899. He was then engaged in teaching, and for a time was professor of the violin at Geneva Conservatoire. On the death of Joseph Joachim in 1907, Marteau was called to the Berlin University of the Arts, where he became head of the violin department. During World War I he was expelled from Germany. The Germans accused him of being a French spy, while the French accused him of being a German spy, so he had to avoid both countries. Instead he moved to Sweden, where he became a citizen in 1915. Marteau was long an advocate of chamber music. On April 13, 1894, for example, he, pianist Ami Lauchame, a violist named Koert, and a cellist named Hegner were reported to have given their second invitation chamber music concert in New York, performing works of Camille Saint-Saëns and Gabriel Fauré; a third concert was scheduled for the following week.\\"Mr. Marteau's Invitation Concerts,\\" The New York Times, April 14, 1894 By 1906, Marteau was leading a string quartet that broke up in a dispute over a work by Max Reger.\\"Max Reger and His Music: New York Has a Chance to Study an Apparently Self-Contradictory Personality in Modern Composition,\\" The New York Times, March 11, 1908 In Berlin, he formed another string quartet with his student Licco Amar as second violinistSleeve notes for Arbiter 138, Hindemith as Interpreter—the Amar-Hindemith Quartet and Hugo Becker as cellist; later, Becker's student George Georgescu would take over the cello position.Biographical sketch published for Concursul George Georgescu 2008 International Contest for Performing Artists, Tulcea, Romania Marteau composed a cantata for soprano, chorus and orchestra, entitled La voix de Jeanne d'Arc. He died in Lichtenberg, Bavaria at the age of 60. In order to revitalize the name and works of Marteau, the Hofer Symphoniker organize the International Violin Competition Henri Marteau. The event takes place every three years at Marteau house in Lichtenberg and at the Freiheitshalle in Hof, Bavaria. ==Selected works== ;Stage * Meister Schwalbe, Musical Comedy in 1 act (1922) ;Concertante * Andante for violin and orchestra (1891)https://www.tobias-broeker.de/rare-manuscripts/m-r/marteau-henri/ * Fantaisie in E major for violin and orchestra, Op. 3 * Cadenza for the Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 77 by Johannes Brahms (1904) * Concerto in B major for cello and orchestra, Op. 7 (1905) * Suite in A major for violin and orchestra, Op. 15 * Concerto in C major for violin and orchestra, Op. 18 (1919) ;Chamber music * Berceuse for violin and piano, Op. 1 (1902) * Berceuse for violin and piano, Op. 2 No. 1 * Feuillet d'Album in D minor for viola and piano, Op. 2 No. 2 * Andantino in A minor for violin and piano, Op. 2 No. 3 * String Quartet No.1 in D major, Op. 5 * Chaconne in C minor for viola and piano, Op. 8 (1905) * String Quartet No.2 in D major, Op. 9 (1905) * Trio in F minor for violin, viola and cello, Op. 12 (1907) * Quintet in C minor for clarinet and string quartet, Op. 13 (1908) * Études d'archet (Bowing Studies) for violin with violin accompaniment, Op. 14 (1910) * String Quartet No.3 in C major, Op. 17 (1921) * Études de gammes (Scale Studies) for violin, Op. 19 (1916) * Sérénade for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet and 2 bassoons, Op. 20 (1922) * 24 Caprices d'execution transcendante for violin and piano, Op. 25 (1919) * Fantaisie for organ and violin, Op. 27 (1910) * Terzetto for flute, violin and viola, Op. 32 (1924) * Sonata Fantastica for violin solo, Op. 35 (1927) * Partita for flute and viola, Op. 42 No. 2 * Divertimento for flute and violin, Op. 43 No. 1 ;Keyboard * Trois Compositions for organ, Op. 23 (1918) ;Vocal * Ave Maria for voice, violin, harp (piano) and organ (harmonium), Op. 4 No. 1 * 8 Songs for voice and string quartet, Op. 10 (1906) * Huit mélodies, Op.19c 1. \\"Pluie\\" (\\"Il pleut.

Lyra's Oxford is set when Lyra Belacqua is 15, two years after the end of the trilogy.Lyra's Oxford, page 30: \\"Since she and Will parted two years before\\" The book consists mainly of an illustrated short story, \\"Lyra and the Birds\\". A fold-out map of \\"Oxford by Train, River and Zeppelin\\" is bound in the book, a fictional map of the Oxford that exists in Lyra's world. It also includes some advertisements for books and travellers' catalogues. Two pages from a Baedeker published in Lyra's world (including entries for the Eagle Ironworks, the Oxford Canal, the Fell Press and the Oratory of St Barnabas the Chymist, all in the Jericho area of Lyra's Oxford), a postcard from the character Mary Malone, and a brochure for the cruise ship Zenobia are also included. The postcard contains four images of sites in the His Dark Materials trilogy: the physics lab in which Mary Malone works, the house occupied by Lord Boreal, the row of hornbeam trees where Will first discovered a window between the worlds, and the bench where Lyra and Will have pledged to visit each other in spirit once a year. The preface by Pullman begins: ==\\"Lyra and the Birds\\" plot summary== Lyra is looking at a flock of birds from the tower of Jordan College in her Oxford, when she notices that the birds are attacking what turns out to be a dæmon in a bird shape. This dæmon must be a witch's because there is no human near. Lyra saves the dæmon, called Ragi, from the flock, and he urges Lyra to help him find a man called Sebastian Makepeace. Lyra cleverly figures out where to find him and that he is the last remaining alchemist, and promises Ragi to bring him to the alchemist after school. In the evening, Lyra escapes from St Sophia's School and leads Ragi from outside Jordan College (Turl Street) to Juxon Street where Sebastian Makepeace lives. Ragi flies above Lyra and hides on roofs to avoid suspicion. On the way, Ragi is attacked by some pigeons, but manages to save himself. Ragi also tells Lyra why he needs Sebastian Makepeace's help: his witch, Yelena Pazhets, is seriously ill. This new illness causes witches to die while not affecting their dæmons, leaving them alive and lonely after their witch's death. Lyra is shocked by this. Reaching Makepeace's house at the end of Juxon Street, near the Oxford Canal, Lyra's dæmon Pantalaimon manages to look through Makepeace's window without being noticed by Ragi. Pan sees the alchemist lying on the floor and witch's instruments nearby. Sensing something is wrong, Lyra continues walking, past Makepeace's house, at which Ragi cries for his witch. Lyra realises it was a trap and now finds herself being attacked by the witch. She moves towards the canal and decides to fight the witch, because this is what Will would do. When Yelena charges, a swan rushes past Lyra and attacks the witch. The witch dies shortly after. Lyra carries the swan back to the canal, after which a recovered Sebastian Makepeace takes her into his house and explains that Yelena wanted to kill Lyra and blame him for the murder: Yelena was once Sebastian's lover and their son died in the war that was waged in The Amber Spyglass. Yelena blamed Lyra for her son's death. Sebastian helps to get Lyra away unnoticed (the dead witch in the middle of the street caused some consternation) and she gets back to St Sophia's. Back home Lyra and Pan contemplate that day's events: the birds were actually helping her and, looking for some meaning behind the events, Lyra feels that Oxford is protecting her. == References == Category:2003 short stories Category:His Dark Materials books Category:Short stories by Philip Pullman Category:Fantasy short stories Category:Novels set in Oxford Category:University of Oxford in fiction Category:Alfred A.

Scotti of the University of Arizona's Spacewatch Project, the asteroid was predicted to make an exceptionally close approach to Earth on 28 October 2028. Additional precovery observations of the asteroid from 1990 were quickly found that refined the orbit and it is now known the asteroid will pass the Earth on 26 October 2028, at a distance of , about 2.4 times the Earth–Moon distance. During the close approach, the asteroid should peak at about apparent magnitude 8.2, and will be visible in binoculars. measures between 0.7 and 1.4 kilometers in diameter. This asteroid also regularly comes near the large asteroid Pallas. === IAU Circular === On 11 March 1998, using a three-month observation arc, a faulty International Astronomical Union circular and press information sheet were put out that incorrectly concluded \\"that the asteroid was 'virtually certain' to pass within 80% of the distance to the Moon and stood a 'small...not entirely out of the question' possibility of hitting the Earth in 2028.\\" But by 23 December 1997, it should have been clear that XF11 had no reasonable possibility of an Earth impact. Within hours of the announcement, independent calculations by Paul Chodas, Don Yeomans, and Karri Muinonen had calculated that the probability of Earth impact was essentially zero, and vastly less than the probability of impact from as-yet- undiscovered asteroids. Chodas (1999) concurs with Marsden (1999) that there was about 1 chance in a hundred thousand that XF11 could have passed through a keyhole—that is, until the 1990 precovery observations eliminated such possibilities. During the October 2002 close approach, the asteroid was observed by the 70-meter Goldstone radar dish, further refining the orbit. ==References== == External links == * at the European Asteroid Research Node (E.A.R.N) * Brian Marsden: : the true story (Archived from the original) * Spacewatch animation of * Asteroid (Earth Close-Approach), JPL Near-Earth Object Program * * * 035396 035396 035396 035396 19971206 ","title":"(35396) 1997 XF11"},{"id":"530295","text":"Josef Rheinberger Josef Gabriel Rheinberger (17 March 1839, in Vaduz – 25 November 1901, in Munich) was an organist and composer, born in Liechtenstein and resident in Germany for most of his life. == Life == Rheinberger's birthplace in Vaduz Josef Gabriel Rheinberger, whose father was the treasurer for Aloys II, Prince of Liechtenstein, showed exceptional musical talent at an early age. When only seven years old, he was already serving as organist of the Vaduz parish church, and his first composition was performed the following year. In 1849, he studied with composer Philipp M. Schmutzer (31 December 1821 – 17 November 1898) in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg.International Rheinberger Society In 1851, his father, who had initially opposed his son's desire to embark on the life of a professional musician, relented and allowed him to enter the Munich Conservatorium. Not long after graduating, he became professor of piano and of composition at the same institution. When this first version of the Munich Conservatorium was dissolved, he was appointed répétiteur at the Court Theatre, from which he resigned in 1867. Josef and Fanny shortly after their marriage Rheinberger married his former pupil, the poet and socialite Franziska \\"Fanny\\" von Hoffnaass (eight years his senior) in 1867. The couple remained childless, but the marriage was happy. Franziska wrote the texts for much of her husband's vocal work. The stylistic influences on Rheinberger ranged from contemporaries such as Brahms to composers from earlier times, such as Mendelssohn, Schumann, Schubert and, above all, Bach. He was also an enthusiast for painting and literature (especially English and German). In 1877 he was appointed court conductor, responsible for the music in the royal chapel. He was subsequently awarded an honorary doctorate by Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. A distinguished teacher, he numbered many Americans among his pupils, including Horatio Parker, William Berwald, George Whitefield Chadwick, Bruno Klein, Sidney Homer and Henry Holden Huss. Other students of his included important figures from Europe: Italian composer Ermanno Wolf- Ferrari, Serbian composer Stevan Stojanovic Mokranjac, and German composers Engelbert Humperdinck and Richard Strauss and the conductor (and composer) Wilhelm Furtwängler. When the second (and present) Munich Conservatorium was founded, Rheinberger was appointed Royal Professor of organ and composition, a post he held for the rest of his life. On 31 December 1892 his wife died, after suffering a long illness. Two years later, poor health led him to give up the post of Court Music Director.Guy Wagner, \\"A Master from Liechtenstein\\" Rheinberger in his later years Rheinberger was a prolific composer. His religious works include twelve Masses (one for double chorus, three for four voices a cappella, three for women's voices and organ, two for men's voices and one with orchestra), a Requiem and a Stabat Mater. His other works include several operas, symphonies,Percy Goetschius, Masters of the Symphony (Boston: Ditson, 1929, 331) wrote that Rheinberger \\"is celebrated mainly for his organ works ... He composed only two symphonies: No. I, Wallenstein, D minor, in the usual four movements, but tracing a definite program, as indicated by the given titles; and No. II, Op. 87, the Florentine.\\" chamber music, and choral works. Today Rheinberger is remembered above all for his elaborate and challenging organ compositions; these include two concertos, 20 sonatas in 20 different keys (of a projected set of 24 sonatas in all the keys), 22 trios, and 36 solo pieces. His organ sonatas were once declared to be Rheinberger died in 1901 in Munich, and was buried in the Alter Südfriedhof.

Opened on September 11, 1926, at a then astronomical cost of $160,000, the Aloha Tower is located at Pier 9 of Honolulu Harbor. It has been, and continues to be, a guiding beacon welcoming vessels to the City and County of Honolulu. Just as the Statue of Liberty greeted hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year to New York City, the Aloha Tower greeted hundreds of thousands of immigrants to Honolulu. At 10 stories and 184 feet (56 m) of height topped with 40 feet (12 m) of flag mast, for four decades the Aloha Tower was the tallest structure in Hawaii. It was built in the Hawaiian Gothic architectural style. ==Attack on Pearl Harbor== When the attack on Pearl Harbor came on December 7, 1941, Coast Guardsmen from the were ordered to take up defensive positions around Aloha Tower and protect it from being occupied. The Aloha Tower was painted in camouflage to disappear at night. ==Redevelopment== In 1981, the Governor of Hawaii and the Hawaii State Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism established the Aloha Tower Development Corporation. The public corporation was charged with developing the land around the Aloha Tower to benefit the state's commercial trade industry based at Honolulu Harbor while at the same time providing the residents of Hawaii with ample access to the downtown waterfront. The entire Aloha Tower Complex, as defined by the public corporation, was identified as Piers 5 and 6, Piers 8 through 23, and portions of Nimitz Highway and Iwilei. ==Museum marketplace== In 1982, the Hawaii Maritime Center was opened near the Aloha Tower in an old royal pier to present the history of Honolulu Harbor and the relative industries it served. In 2002, the Hawaii Maritime Center became an incorporated institution of the Bishop Museum. The center was closed to the public on May 1, 2009. Docked at the royal pier is the Falls of Clyde, a historic shipping vessel. ==Recent developments== The Aloha Tower Development Corporation continues its work today with plans to modernize the facilities and infrastructure in and around the Aloha Tower Complex. Its most significant hurdle is to find a way of making travel through Nimitz Highway more efficient. In 2004, a controversial proposal was made to construct an underground highway tunnel beneath the complex. Other proposals include the establishment of streetcars, elimination of commercial high-rises in the area and increase of high-rise residential units instead. State officials want to close the parking lot fronting the Aloha Tower and destroy the adjacent Hawaiian Electric Company power plant, then fill the space with a park. In consideration of heightened security measures after 9/11, tourist access to the observation deck was restricted, but has since been reopened. Today, Hawaii Pacific University has purchased and is continuing to redevelop the space. Portions of the second and third floor are now used as student housing with 370 beds.https://www.hpu.edu/residence-life/waterfront-lofts.html The ground floor features the HPU Welcome Center, eSports arena, as well as other student facilities.https://www.khon2.com/hawaii-pacific-university-esports- tournament/hpu-president-talks-esports-and-marketplace/ The Old Spaghetti Factory moved in as of 2018 and the Star of Honolulu Dinner Cruise operates out of pier 8 side of the marketplace.https://starofhonolulu.com/ Aloha Tower Marketplace also has several indoor and outdoor events spaces available for public and private events.https://www.alohatower.com/events/index.html ==Gallery== Image:fallsofclydehonolulu.jpgDocked at the Aloha Tower Complex is the Falls of Clyde, the only iron-hulled, four-masted ship in the world.

His first musical training came from his father Robert Riemann, a land owner, bailiff and, to judge from locally surviving listings of his songs and choral works, an active music enthusiast. Hugo Riemann was educated by Heinrich Frankenberger, the Sondershausen Choir Master, in Music theory. He was taught the piano by August Barthel and Theodor Ratzenberger (who had once studied under Liszt). He studied law, and finally philosophy and history at Berlin and Tübingen. After participating in the Franco-Prussian War he decided to devote his life to music, and studied accordingly at the Leipzig Conservatory. He then went to Bielefeld for some years as a teacher and conductor, but in 1878 returned to Leipzig as a visiting professor (\\"Privatdozent\\") at the University. As a much-desired appointment at the Conservatory did not materialize, Riemann went to Bromberg in 1880, but 1881–90 he was a teacher of piano and theory at Hamburg Conservatory. After a short time at the Sondershausen Conservatory, he held a post in the conservatory at Wiesbaden (1890–95). He eventually returned to Leipzig University as lecturer in 1895. In 1901, he was appointed professor, and in 1914 he was made Director of the Institute of Musicology. 8 days before he would have turned 70, he died of jaundice. ==Writings== Riemann is one of the most influential music theorists. In his publications and lectures he coined various terms which are still in every day use, such as the harmonic function theory (therein popular terms such as the tonic, the dominant, the subdominant and the parallel). In addition, the term and theory of the metric and rhythmic phrase, a basic element of today's music education, originate in Riemann.System der musikalischen Rhythmik und Metrik (Leipzig, 1903) Among his best-known works are the Musik-Lexikon (1882; 5th ed. 1899; Eng. trans., 1893–96), a complete dictionary of music and musicians, the Geschichte der musiktheorie im IX.-XIX. jahrhundert(1898), a history of music theory in Europe through the 19th century, the Handbuch der Harmonielehre, a work on the study of harmony, and the Lehrbuch des Contrapunkts, a similar work on counterpoint, all of which have been translated into English. He was an advocate of harmonic dualism, and his theory of harmonic function is the foundation of harmonic theory as it is still taught in Germany. He also elaborated a set of harmonic transformations that was adapted by the American theorist David Lewin, and eventually evolved into a significant strain of neo- Riemannian theory. Another pillar of modern neo-Riemannian theory, the Tonnetz, was not Riemann's own invention, but he played an important role in popularizing and disseminating it. He authored many works on many different branches of music. His pupils included the German composer, pianist, organist, and conductor Max Reger, and the musicologist and composer Walter Niemann. ==Compositions== He wrote many pieces for piano, songs, a piano sonata, six sonatinas, a violin sonata, and a string quartet. == See also == * Riemannian theory * Neo-Riemannian theory * Chordal space * Modulatory space * Functional harmony * Parallel and counter parallel ==Notes== ==References== * Alexander Rehding: Hugo Riemann and the birth of modern musical thought.

Founded in 1950, it was the largest labor federation in Japan for several decades. ==Origins== In the immediate aftermath of Japan's defeat in World War II, the United States-led Allied Occupation of Japan issued directives legalizing labor unions, which were then protected by the new Constitution of Japan promulgated in 1947. In the early postwar years, numerous labor unions formed in industries throughout Japan, but most of these were under the influence of the Japan Communist Party. However in 1950, following the advent of the global Cold War, and taking advantage of the sense of crisis precipitated by the sudden outbreak of the Korean War, conservative Japanese government and business leaders launched, with the tacit approval of US Occupation authorities, a so-called Red Purge to remove communists and suspected communists from government and private-sector jobs. As part of the purge, Japanese conservatives fomented \\"democracy cells\\" within the established, Communist Party-dominated labor unions. As these unions collapsed amid the purge, the cells emerged to form a new labor federation, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, or Sōhyō. ==Early militancy== Conservatives hoped that the new federation would be more moderate than the federations controlled by the Communist Party, which had been extremely militant. However, Sōhyō rapidly fell under the sway of the Japan Socialist Party and took the lead in organizing an escalating series of increasingly large and contentious labor actions over the course of the 1950s, and increasingly became involved in political protests as well. On May 1, 1952, Sōhyō spearheaded a nationwide day of protest against the perceived one-sided nature of the Peace Treaty ending the Occupation of Japan. Although most of these activities were peaceful, a violent clash between protesters and police outside the Imperial Palace in Tokyo led to several deaths and injuries and became remembered as \\"Bloody May Day.\\" Over the rest of the 1950s, Sōhyō became actively involved in a number of political and social movements, including movements to ban nuclear weapons and against US military bases in Japan. It also led a large number of strikes for higher wages across many different industries. Sōhyō's period of militancy culminated in 1960 when it took a leading role in the massive Anpo protests against revision of the US Japan Security Treaty, as well as the large-scale strike at the Miike Coal Mine in northern Kyushu. As part of the anti-Security Treaty Struggle, Sōhyō organized a nationwide general strike that involved 6.4 million workers and remains the largest recorded strike in Japanese history. However, both these efforts ended in disastrous defeats, and thereafter Sōhyō increasingly retreated from contentious strikes in favor of more moderate workplace actions. ==Merger to form Rengo== A large portion of Sōhyō merged with the more conservative Japanese Confederation of Labor (Domei)The Japan Times EDITORIAL - Rengo's uphill battle October 31, 2005 Retrieved on August 15 2012 and other unions to form Rengo in 1987.

Gandini, along with noted Italian car designers Giorgetto Giugiaro and Leonardo Fioravanti, were all born in 1938, within months of each other. In a 2009 interview with Robert Cumberford, editor at Automobile Magazine, Gandini indicated, \\"his design interests are focused on vehicle architecture, construction, assembly, and mechanisms – not appearance.\\" Gandini was one of twenty-five designers nominated for Car Designer of the Century. ==Early life== The son of an orchestral conductor, Gandini, was born in Turin. In 1963, he approached Nuccio Bertone, head of the Gruppo Bertone company, for work. However, Giorgetto Giugiaro, then Bertone's chief designer, opposed him being hired. When Giugiaro left Bertone two years later, Gandini was hired, and worked for the company for fourteen years. Creator of Stile Bertone in Caprie, Gandini served as general manager of the styling house, designing show cars as well as managing the construction of prototype automobiles. Gandini designed Lamborghini's groundbreaking mid-engined Miura and extreme Countach, as well as many practical cars such as the Citroën BX, the first-generation BMW 5 Series (E12), the Innocenti Mini, and the Renault Supercinq. He introduced the concept of scissor doors with the Alfa Romeo 33 Carabo prototype, while the Lancia Stratos sports car was another Gandini design. Gandini left Bertone in 1980, pursuing freelance automotive, industrial, and interior design. Gandini has worked in other areas, including home architecture, the design of a nightclub interior, and the body styling of the Heli-Sport CH-7 helicopter. ==Designs== Gandini car designs include: *Alfa Romeo Montreal concept and production version *Alfa Romeo 33 Carabo *Alfa Romeo 90 *Autobianchi A112 *Autobianchi A112 Runabout *Bertone Pirana *Bugatti EB 110 (prototypes) *BMW 5 Series (E12), including the concept Garmisch in 1970 *Citroën BX *Citroën Camargue *Cizeta-Moroder V16T *De Tomaso Biguà (Qvale Mangusta) *De Tomaso Pantera SI *De Tomaso Pantera 'Prossima Generazione' *Dino/Ferrari 308 GT4 *Ferrari Rainbow *Fiat 132 *Fiat X1/9 *Iso Lele *Iso Grifo 90 *Iso Grifo 96 *Jaguar Ascot *Lamborghini Bravo *Lamborghini Countach *Lamborghini P140 *Lamborghini Diablo (prototypes) *Lamborghini P147 Acosta *Lamborghini Espada *Lamborghini Jarama *Lamborghini Miura *Lamborghini Urraco *Lamborghini Marzal *Lancia Stratos Zero *Lancia Stratos *Lancia SibiloThe Lancia Sibilo Was Nuts Even By 1970s Concept Car Standards – Jalopnik *Maserati Khamsin *Maserati Ghibli II *Maserati Quattroporte II (1974–1978) & IV (1994–2001) *Maserati Shamal *Maserati Chubasco *1st and 2nd Maserati Biturbos facelift *Nissan AP-X *NSU Trapeze *Renault 5 Turbo *Renault 5 Supercinq *Renault Magnum *TaMo Racemo *Stola S81 Stratos *Stola S86 Diamante *Volvo Tundra Lamborghini Miura Sinsheim.jpgLamborghini Miura S Alfa Romeo Carabo Bertone (4345325783).jpgAlfa Romeo Carabo Countach Scherentueren.jpgLamborghini Countach LP400 2002ti-Garmisch 2019-05-26.jpgGarmisch, concept for BMW 1970 Maserati Khamsin.jpgMaserati Khamsin Lancia Stratos Zero (7522598642).jpgLancia Stratos Zero Lancia STRATOS (8014528000).jpgGandini's iconic Lancia Stratos 62° Coppa Intereuropa - Autodromo Nazionale Monza - 21-06-2015 (19230336115).jpgStola S81 Stratos Bmw e12 v sst.jpgBMW 5-series (1st generation) 1993 Maserati Shamal coupe (21175976552).jpgMaserati Shamal Citroen BX Madrid.jpgCitroen BX Hatchback became one of the best selling Citroen models Bertone105 (27092146177).jpg1976 Ferrari Rainbow concept at left, and Ferrari GT4 at right TaMo Racemo.jpgTaMo Racemo by Tata Motors ==References== ==External links== *Fiat X1/9 web site * BMW Designers Marcello Gandini on the page with an overview of automotive designers working for BMW. * Marcello Gandini: Maestro of Design by Gautam Sen.

They are known as the daisybushes or African daisies. Osteospermum used to belong to the genus Dimorphotheca, but only the annual species remain in that genus; the perennials belong to Osteospermum. The genus Osteospermum is also closely related to the small genus Chrysanthemoides, such as C. incana and C. monilifera. ==Names== The scientific name is derived from the Greek osteon (bone) and Latin spermum (seed). It has been given several common names: African daisy, South African daisy, Cape daisy and blue-eyed daisy. ==Description== Their alternate (rarely opposite) leaves are green, but some variegated forms exist. The leaf form is lanceolate. The leaf margin is entire, but hardy types are toothed. The daisy- like composite flower consists of disc florets and ray florets, growing singly at the end of branches or sometimes in inflorescences of terminal corymbose cymes. The disc florets are pseudo-bisexual and come in several colors such as blue, yellow and purple. The hardy types usually show a dark blue center in the disc until the yellow pollen is shed. The ray florets are female and are found diverse colors such as white, cream, pink, purple, mauve to yellow. Some cultivars have \\"spooned\\" petals such as \\"Pink Whirls\\". Many species flower a second time late summer, stimulated by the cooler night temperatures. Hardy types show profuse flowering in the spring, but they do not get a second flush of flowers. ==Species== * Osteospermum acanthospermum * Osteospermum amplectens * Osteospermum attenuatum * Osteospermum australe * Osteospermum barberiae * Osteospermum breviradiatum, Lemoenboegoe * Osteospermum burttianum * Osteospermum calendulaceum L. f., Stinking Roger (synonym of Oligocarpus calendulaceus) * Osteospermum caulescens * Osteospermum clandestinum (synonym of Tripteris clandestina) * Osteospermum dentatum * Osteospermum ecklonis (DC.)

New species are still being discovered, such as O. australe, O. burttianum and O. potbergense. ==Distribution== There are about 70 species native to southern and eastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula. ==Cultivation== Osteospermum are popular in cultivation, where they are frequently used in summer bedding schemes in parks and gardens. Numerous hybrids and cultivars have been grown with a wide range of tropical colors. Yellow cultivars tend to have a yellow center (sometimes off-white). Plants prefer a warm and sunny position and rich soil, although they tolerate poor soil, salt or drought well. Modern cultivars flower continuously when watered and fertilised well, and dead-heading is not necessary, because they do not set seed easily. If planted in a container, soil should be prevented from drying out completely. If they do, the plants will go into \\"sleep mode\\" and survive the period of drought, but they will abort their flower buds and not easily come back into flower. Moreover, roots are relatively susceptible to rotting if watered too profusely after the dry period. ===Cultivars=== Most widely sold cultivars are grown as annuals, are mainly hybrids of O. jucundum, O. ecklonis and O. grandiflorum and can be hardy to -2 °C (30 °F).

The show was presented on television in many formats, between its inception on 1 July 1959 and 1999, from five-minute slots to a one-and-a-half-hour variety show featuring other performers, and has had several name changes, originally airing as Mr. Squiggle and Friends. At its height, the program was one of the most popular children's programs in Australia and toured theatre and conventions, entertaining several generations who grew with the program. It became one of the longest-running children's programs on Australian television. ==History== Mr. Squiggle, the central character was created by cartoonist and puppeteer Norman Hetherington, and the character first appeared on the Children's TV Club on ABC TV,Timeline – 50 Years of Kids TV, Australian Broadcasting Corporation. but was spun off into his own programme which first aired on 1 July 1959. Hetherington voiced and operated all of the show's puppets, while his wife Margaret wrote the scripts. The basic premise of the show remained the same: children wrote in with their \\"squiggles\\" and Mr. Squiggle would turn them into recognisable drawings by connecting lines with his pencil nose. More often than not, the picture would be drawn upside down (Hetherington manipulated the puppet from above by viewing the drawing upside down), and then Mr. Squiggle would gleefully declare, \\"Upside down! Upside down!\\"—asking his assistant to turn the picture the right way up and reveal the completed drawing. The last episode went to air just over 40 years after the first, on 9 July 1999. The last episode was produced in 1997; however, it was not until 2001 that the contract with the ABC concluded. After the show ceased production, the entire cast of puppets from Mister Squiggle and Friends were owned by the show's creator, Norman Hetherington. They have been loaned for display at exhibitions, such as at the National Film and Sound Archive and as part of the \\"50 Years of TV\\" exhibition at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in 2007. Hetherington and his puppets appeared on the ABC TV series Collectors in 2010. ==CharactersMr. Squiggle=== Mr. Squiggle, the central character is a marionette with a pencil for a nose, who visits his friends from his home at 93 Crater Crescent on the Moon, flying to Earth in his pet rocket (named Rocket). In every episode he would create several pictures from \\"squiggles\\" sent in by children from around the country. Mr. Squiggle is a cheery, gentle and good-natured yet scatter-brained character who is often distracted and occasionally goes for \\"space-walks\\", leading his assistant to calm him down and get him to focus on the task of drawing. ===Other characters=== Other puppet characters that appeared in the show included: * Blackboard, the grumpy blackboard that Mr. Squiggle uses for an easel, whose catchphrases are \\"Hurry up\\", \\"Hmmph\\", \\"Double hmmph\\" and \\"Booorrriing\\". * Gus the Snail, who had a TV for a shell and later, a flower pot, often tells knock-knock jokes. * Bill the Steam Shovel, who likes to tell corny jokes and belch steam (talcum powder) out of his \\"nose\\" when he laughs. ===Assistants=== Mr. Squiggle was helped by a human assistant in all of the show's incarnations; they included Miss Gina (Gina Curtis), Miss Pat (Pat Lovell),Bolton, Jessica, \\"Mr Squiggle's Christmas Cards: From Norman Hetherington to Patricia Lovell\\", National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, December 2017. Miss Jane (Jane Fennell), and later series featured Roxanne (Roxanne Kimmorley) and Rebecca (Rebecca Hetherington, Hetherington's daughter). In his first incarnation as Mr. Jolly Squiggle on the Children's TV Club his assistant was Miss Faith (Faith Linton). ===Guest cast=== Comedians Mikey Robins and Merrick Watts played one of the show's characters, Reg Linchpin, for a year from 1989 to 1990.Quinn, (2001). Other notable guest performers on the show included actor Paul Chubb and magician Timothy Hyde. ==Commemorated== In February 2019 the Royal Australian Mint released a series of two dollar coins to mark the 60th anniversary of the first broadcast of the programme. The coins feature images of Squiggle himself, Gus the Snail, Bill the Steam Shovel, and Blackboard. ==See also== * Norman Hetherington * List of longest-running Australian television series == Footnotes == == References == * ABC TV programme: Australian Story: 30 October 1996: \\"Mr. Squiggle\\". * ABC TV programme: The Collectors: 2010: Episode 21: (Friday 30 July 2010): \\"Mr. Squiggle\\". * Anon, \\"Wonderbox\\", The Australian Women's Weekly, (Wednesday, 28 October 1964), p.17. * Anon, \\"Prime Minister gets Squiggled\\", The Herald Sun, Thursday, 28 May 2009. * Anon, \\"Man behind Mr Squiggle dies\\", ABC News, Tuesday, 7 December 2010. * Bradshaw, R.,\\"Norman Hetherington 1921 – 2010 (Eulogy)\\", O.P.E.N., No.11, (December 2010), pp.2–4. * Design and Art Australia Online Biography: Norman Hetherington. * Foyle, L., \\"Creative Mind Thrilled Children\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday, 8 December 2010. * Guss, Naomi, \\"Australian puppetry – Mr. Squiggle\\", School of Puppetry, Monday, 6 December 2010). * Johnson, C., \\"Award-winning Stuff from Mr. Squiggle\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, (Monday, 11 June 1990), p.3. * McDonald, T., \\"Mr Squiggle's creator dies\\", A.M.

A horse-drawn boat or tow-boat is a historic boat operating on a canal, pulled by a horse walking beside the canal on a towpath. ==United Kingdom== The Romans are known to have used mules to haul boats on their waterways in the UK. Boat horses were the prime movers of the Industrial Revolution, and they remained at work until the middle of the 20th century. A horse, towing a boat with a rope from the towpath, could pull fifty times as much cargo as it could pull in a cart or wagon on roads. In the early days of the Canal Age, from about 1740, all boats and barges were towed by horse, mule, hinny, pony or sometimes a pair of donkeys. Many of the surviving buildings and structures had been designed with horse power in mind. Horse-drawn boats were used well into the 1960s on UK canals for commercial transport, and are still used today by passenger trip boats and other pleasure traffic. The Horseboating Society has the primary aims of preserving and promoting Horseboating on the canals of the United Kingdom. There are horseboat operators at Foxton, Godalming, Tiverton, Ashton- under-Lyne, Newbury, Llangollen and Maesbury Marsh, Shropshire on the Montgomery Canal. ===NB Maria=== Horseboat Maria on the Peak Forest Canal Maria is Britain's oldest surviving wooden narrowboat, built in 1854 by Jinks Boatyard in Marple, and was never converted to have an engine. From 1854 to 1897, Maria was used to carry railway track ballast for the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. She was then used as a maintenance boat until 1962, lay abandoned for nine years until being salvaged in 1972 and converted to a passenger boat in 1978. In 2000 she was restored to near original operating condition. Maria is currently owned by Ashton Packet Boat Company. She is sometimes loaned to the Horseboating Society and has taken part in several of their events, including British Waterways' \\"Coal and Cotton\\" event, celebrating the Leeds and Liverpool Canal's history of transporting coal from Leeds and Wigan to Liverpool, and taking cotton from Liverpool docks to Leeds. In 2006 she was the first boat to have been legged through Standedge Tunnel in 60 years. A UK Government minister and a local Member of Parliament took turns at legging Maria through the highest, longest, and deepest canal tunnel in the UK. ==See also== *Experiment (horse powered boat) *Flatboat *Horseboating Society *Narrowboat *Team boat *Trekschuit (horse-drawn boat in the Netherlands) ==References== ==External links== *http://www.canaljunction.com/craft/horsedrawn1.htm *http://www.horsedrawnboats.co.uk/ *The Horseboating Society *Kennet Horse Boat Company Category:Boat types Category:Animal-powered vehicles Category:Horse transportation de:Treideln pl:Burłak ","title":"Horse-drawn boat"},{"id":"530337","text":"Abu Mansur Ali ibn Ahmad Asadi Tusi () was a Persian poet, linguist and author. He was born at the beginning of the 11th century in Tus, Iran, in the province of Khorasan, and died in the late 1080s in Tabriz. Asadi Tusi is considered an important Persian poet of the Iranian national epics. His best- known work is Garshaspnameh, written in the style of the Shahnameh. == Life == Little is known about Asadi's life. Most of the Khorasan province was under violent attack by Turkish groups; many intellectuals fled, and those who remained generally lived in seclusion. Asadi spent his first twenty years in Ṭūs. From about 1018 to 1038 AD, he was a poet at the court of the Daylamite Abū Naṣr Jastān. Here, in 1055–56, Asadi copied Abū Manṣūr Mowaffaq Heravī's Ketāb al-abnīa al-adwīa. He later went to Nakhjavan and completed his seminal work, the Garshāsp-nama (dedicated to Abu Dolaf, ruler of Nakhjavan), in 1065–1066. Asadi then served at the court of the Shaddadid king Manuchehr, who ruled Ani. The poet's tomb is in the city of Tabriz. == Works == Asadi's most significant work is Garshāsp-nama (The Book [or Epic] of Garshāsp). His other important contribution is a lexicon of the modern Persian language (). Five of Asadi's Monāẓarāt () (Debates in the form of poetry between two people or objects or concepts) also still exist. === Garshaspnama (The Epic of Garshāsp) === The Garshaspnama () epic, with 9,000 couplets, is Asadi Tusi's major work. The hero of the poem is Garshasp (father of Kariman and great-grandfather of Šam), identified in the Shahnameh with the ancient Iranian hero Kərəsāspa- (Avestan language). In Avestan he was the son of Θrita- of the Yama clan. The poet adapted the story from a book, The Adventures of Garshāsp, saying that it complements the stories of the Shahnameh; although the poem was part of folklore, it was based on written sources. The poem begins with Yama (or Jamshid), the father of Garshāsp, who was overthrown by Zahhak and flees to Ghurang, king of Zabulistan (near modern Quetta). In Zabulistan, Jamshid falls in love with the king's daughter and she gives birth to Garshāsp. Jamshid is forced to flee. When Garshāsp's mother poisons herself, he spends much of his life with his grandfather and grows up to be a warrior like Jamshid. After Ghurang's death Zahhak was to become king, although the secret remains until the birth of Kariman. Zahhak, as king, visits Zābulistān and challenges the young Garshāsp to slay a dragon. Equipped with an antidote to dragon poison and armed with special weapons, Garshāsp kills the monster. Impressed with the child's prowess, Zahhāk sends Garshāsp to India, where the king (a vassal of Zahhāk's) has been replaced by the rebel prince Bahu (who does not acknowledge Zahhāk's rule). Garshāsp defeats the rebel and remains in India to observe its marvels and engage in philosophical discourse. He then goes to Sarandib (Ceylon), where he sees the footprint of the Buddha (in Muslim sources, identified with the footprint of Adam). Asadi then recounts many legends about Adam, the father of mankind. Garshasp then meets a Brahman, whom he questions in detail about philosophy and religion. The words Asadi Tusi attributes to the Brahman relate to his Islamic neo-Platonism. Garshasp later visits Indian islands and sees supernatural wonders, which are described at great length. The hero returns home and pays homage to Zahak. He woos a princess of Rum, restores her father (Eṯreṭ) to his throne in Zābol after his defeat by the King of Kābol and builds the city of Sistān. He has anachronistic adventures in the Mediterranean, fighting in Kairouan and Córdoba. In the West, he meets a \\"Greek Brahman\\" and engages in philosophical discourse with the wise man. When he returns to Iran his father dies, and Garshāsp becomes king of Zābolestān. Although he has no son of his own, he adopts Narēmān (Rostam's great-grandfather) as his heir. At this time Ferēdūn defeats Zahak and becomes king of Iran, and Garshāsp swears allegiance to him. Garshāsp and his nephew then go to Turan and defeat the Faghfūr of Chin (an Iranian title for the ruler of Central Asia and China, probably of Sogdian origin), bringing him as a captive to Ferēdūn. Garshāsp fights a final battle with the king of Tanger, slaying another dragon before he returns to Sistān in Zābolestān and dies. === Loḡat-e fors (Khorasani Persian dictionary) === The dictionary was written to familiarize the people of Arran and Iranian Azerbaijan with unfamiliar phrases in Eastern Persian (Darī) poetry. It is the oldest existing Persian dictionary based on examples from poetry, and contains fragments of lost literary works such as Kalila and Dimna by Rudaki and Vamiq and 'Adhra by Unsuri. A variety of manuscripts exist in Iran and elsewhere; the oldest (1322) may be at the Malek Library in Tehran, although the one written in Safina-yi Tabriz is also from the same period. === Monāẓarāt (debates) === Five debates survive in the Persian poetic form of qasida. Although qasida is unprecedented in Arabic or New Persian, it is part of the Middle Persian (Pahlavi) tradition. The Pahlavic poetic debate Draxt i Asurik indicates the history of this form of debate. The surviving debates are Arab o 'Ajam (The Arab vs. the Persian), Mogh o Mosalman (The Zoroastian vs. the Muslim), Shab o Ruz (Night vs. Day), Neyza o Kaman (Spear vs. Bow) and Asman o Zamin (Sky vs. Earth). The Persian wins the Persian-versus-Arab debate, while the Muslim defeats the Zoroastrian. ==See also== *Persian literature *List of Persian poets and authors *Nozhat al-Majales ==References== ==Further reading== *Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"Asadi Tusi\\", Dj.

The control grid usually consists of a cylindrical screen or helix of fine wire surrounding the cathode, and is surrounded in turn by the anode. The control grid was invented by Lee De Forest, who in 1906 added a grid to the Fleming valve (thermionic diode) to create the first amplifying vacuum tube, the Audion (triode). == Operation == In a valve, the hot cathode emits negatively charged electrons, which are attracted to and captured by the anode, which is given a positive voltage by a power supply. The control grid between the cathode and anode functions as a \\"gate\\" to control the current of electrons reaching the anode. A more negative voltage on the grid will repel the electrons back toward the cathode so fewer get through to the anode. A less negative, or positive, voltage on the grid will allow more electrons through, increasing the anode current. A given change in grid voltage causes a proportional change in plate current, so if a time-varying voltage is applied to the grid, the plate current waveform will be a copy of the applied grid voltage. A relatively small variation in voltage on the control grid causes a significantly large variation in anode current. The presence of a resistor in the anode circuit causes a large variation in voltage to appear at the anode. The variation in anode voltage can be much larger than the variation in grid voltage which caused it, and thus the tube can amplify, functioning as an amplifier. == Construction == Structure of a modern low-power triode vacuum tube. The glass and outer electrodes are shown partly cut away to reveal the construction. The grid in the first triode valve consisted of a zig-zag piece of wire placed between the filament and the anode. This quickly evolved into a helix or cylindrical screen of fine wire placed between a single strand filament (or later, a cylindrical cathode) and a cylindrical anode. The grid is usually made of a very thin wire that can resist high temperatures and is not prone to emitting electrons itself. Molybdenum alloy with a gold plating is frequently used. It is wound on soft copper sideposts, which are swaged over the grid windings to hold them in place. A 1950s variation is the frame grid, which winds very fine wire onto a rigid stamped metal frame. This allows the holding of very close tolerances, so the grid can be placed closer to the filament (or cathode). == Effects of grid position == By placing the control grid closer to the filament/cathode relative to the anode, a greater amplification results. This degree of amplification is referred to in valve data sheets as the amplification factor, or \\"mu\\". It also results in higher transconductance, which is a measure of the anode current change versus grid voltage change. The noise figure of a valve is inversely proportional to its transconductance; higher transconductance generally means lower noise figure. Lower noise can be very important when designing a radio or television receiver. == Multiple control grids == A valve can contain more than one control grid. The hexode contains two such grids, one for a received signal and one for the signal from a local oscillator. The valve's inherent non- linearity causes not only both original signals to appear in the anode circuit, but also the sum and difference of those signals. This can be exploited as a frequency-changer in superheterodyne receivers. == Grid variations == A variation of the control grid is to produce the helix with a variable pitch. This gives the resultant valve a distinct non-linear characteristic.Variable mu valves This is often exploited in R.F. amplifiers where an alteration of the grid bias changes the mutual conductance and hence the gain of the device. This variation usually appears in the pentode form of the valve, where it is then called a variable-mu pentode or remote-cutoff pentode. One of the principal limitations of the triode valve is that there is considerable capacitance between the grid and the anode (Cag). A phenomenon known as the Miller Effect causes the input capacitance of an amplifier to be the product of Cag and amplification factor of the valve. This, and the instability of an amplifier with tuned input and output when Cag is large can severely limit the upper operating frequency. These effects can be overcome by the addition of a screen grid, however in the later years of the tube era, constructional techniques were developed that rendered this 'parasitic capacitance' so low that triodes operating in the upper very high frequency (VHF) bands became possible. The Mullard EC91 operated at up to 250 MHz. The anode-grid capacitance of the EC91 is quoted in manufacturer's literature as 2.5 pF, which is higher than many other triodes of the era, while many triodes of the 1920s had figures which are strictly comparable, so there was no advance in this area. However, early screen-grid tetrodes of the 1920s, have Cag of only 1 or 2fF, around a thousand times less. 'Modern' pentodes have comparable values of Cag. Triodes were used in VHF amplifiers in 'grounded- grid' configuration, a circuit arrangement which prevents Miller feedback. == References == Category:Vacuum tubes Category:Electrodes ","title":"Control grid"},{"id":"530348","text":"East Azerbaijan Province ( Āzarbāijān-e Sharqi; ) is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is located in Iranian Azerbaijan, bordering with Armenia, Republic of Azerbaijan, Ardabil Province, West Azerbaijan Province, and Zanjan Province. The capital of East Azerbaijan is Tabriz. East Azerbaijan Province is in Regions 3 of Iran, with its secretariat located in its capital city, Tabriz. ==Geography== East Azerbaijan State Capital Arg-e Tabriz Arasbaran Forests, a UNESCO reserved biosphere The province covers an area of approximately 47,830 km², it has a population of around four million people. The province has common borders with the Republic of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Autonomous Nakhchivan in the north, West Azerbaijan in the west, Zanjan in the south, and Ardabil in east. A fine network of roads and railways connect East Azerbaijan to other parts of Iran and also to neighboring countries. The highest point in East Azerbaijan is the volcanic peak of Sahand Mountain at of elevation, lying south of Tabriz, whereas the lower lying areas are around Garmadooz (Ahar). The hills and mountains of the province are divided into three ranges: the Qara Daq Mountains, the Sahand and Bozqoosh Mountains, and the Qaflan Kooh Mountains. Climate of East Azerbaijan is affected by Mediterranean Continental as well as cold semi-arid climate. Gentle breezes off the Caspian Sea have some influence on the climate of the low-lying areas. Temperatures run up to 8.9 °C in Tabriz, and 20 °C in Maraqeh, in the winter dropping to −10–−15 °C at least (depending on how cold the overall year is). The ideal seasons to visit this province are in the spring and summer months. ==History== East Azerbaijan is one of the most archaic territories in Iran. During the reign of Alexander of Macedon in Iran (331 BCE), a warrior known as Attorpat led a revolt in this area, then a territory of the Medes, and thereafter it was called Attorpatkan. Since then this vicinity has been known as Azarabadegan, Azarbadgan and Azarbayjan. Islamic researchers proclaim that the birth of the prophet Zoroaster was in this area, in the vicinity of Lake Orumieh (Chichesht), Konzak City. Needless to say, this province was subject to numerous political and economical upheavals, attracting the interest of foreigners. The Russians in particular have tried to exert a lasting influence in the region over the past 300 years, occupying the area on numerous occasions. The constitutionalist movement of Iran began here in the late 19th century. Ethnic tensions in Azerbaijan can legally trace their origins back to the colonialist policies of Imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union. In a cable sent on 6 July 1945 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the local Soviet commander in Russian (northern) held Azerbaijan was instructed as such: In 1945, the Soviet Union helped set up the Azerbaijan People's Government in what is now East Azerbaijan. ==Administrative divisions== At the 1986 census there were twelve counties in East Azerbaijan Province. By the 1996 census two additional counties had been formed, Jolfa from part of Marand, and Malekan from part of Bonab. Between 1996 and 2002, five new counties were formed: Ajabshir, Azarshahr, Charoimaq, Osku, and Varzaqan. In 2010 Kalibar was split in half with the northern part becoming Khoda Afarin, while the southern part kept the name Kalibar. ===Counties at the 1986 census=== { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; background:#ffffff;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#f0f0f0\\" !

Apart from this, the province also boasts numerous learned scholars, gnostics, several national poets such as Mowlana Baba Mazeed, Khajeh Abdol Raheem Aj Abadi, Sheikh Hassan Bolqari, and Abdolqader Nakhjavani, to name a few, and the contemporary poet Ostad Mohammad Hossein Shahriyar. The current leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, also originally comes from this region. Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization has registered 936 sites of historical significance in the province. Some are contemporary, and some are from the antiquity of ancient Persia. \\"Zahak Citadel\\", for example, is the name of an ancient ruin in East Azerbaijan, which according to various experts, was inhabited from the second millennium BC until the Timurid era. First excavated in the 1800s by British archeologists, Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization has been studying the structure in 6 phases. East Azerbaijan enjoys a rich compendium of Azeri traditions. Many local dances and folk songs continue to survive among the various peoples of the province. As a longstanding province of Iran, Azerbaijan is mentioned favorably on many occasions in Persian literature by Iran's greatest authors and poets. ==Notable people== * Qatran Tabrizi, poet * Ahmad Kasravi, historian * Samad Behrangi * Sattar Khan, revolutionary leader * Bagher Khan, revolutionary leader * Gayk Bzhishkyan * Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh * Parvin E'tesami, poet * Ali Daei, Iranian soccer player * Karim Bagheri, soccer star * Iraj Mirza, poet and politician * Maqsud Ali Tabrizi * Ivan Galamian * Hassan Roshdieh * Shams Tabrizi, mystic * Vartan Gregorian, President of Carnegie Corporation * Ali Salimi * Ali Soheili, Prime Minister of Iran * Ebrahim Hakimi, Prime Minister of Iran * Mahmud Jam, Prime Minister of Iran * Mohammad Hossein Shahriar * Asadi Tusi is buried here ==East Azerbaijan today== Museum of Azerbaijan Bank Sepah, Tabriz East Azerbaijan province is an industrial centre of Iran. East Azerbaijan province has over 5000 manufacturing units (6% percent of national total). The value of product from these units in 1997 was US$374 million (373 billion rials = 4.07% of the national total). Total investments were valued at US$2.7 billion (2.4513 trillion rials) in 1997.According to the information released by the office of the provincial governor. Some of the major industries in East Azerbaijan are glass industries, paper manufacturing, steel, copper and nepheline syenite, oil refinery, petrochemical processing facilities, chemical products, pharmaceutical processing, foundries, vehicle and auto-parts industries, industrial machines, agricultural machine, food industries, leather and shoe industries. East Azerbaijan has an excellent position in the handicraft industry of Iran, which has a large share in the exports of the province. Tabriz carpets are widely known around the world and in international markets for their vibrant designs and colors. At present there are about 66,000 carpet production units in the province, employing some 200,000 people. The annual production of these carpets is roughly 792,000 m², which comprises more than 70% of Iran's carpet exports. 35% of all Iranian carpets are produced in East Azerbaijan. East Azerbaijan province is also one of the richest regions of Iran in natural minerals, with 180 mines in 1997, of which 121 units are currently in operation, and the rest are being planned.

Tidy was appointed MBE in 2000 for \\"Services to Journalism\\". He is noted for his charitable work, particularly for the Lord's Taverners, which he has supported for over 30 years. Deeply proud of his working-class roots in the North of England, his most abiding cartoon strips, such as the Cloggies and the Fosdyke Saga, have been set in an exaggerated version of that environment. He now lives in Boylestone, Derbyshire. ==Early life== He was born in Tranmere, a suburb of Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 9 October 1933 and brought up in Liverpool, where he was educated to the age of 15 at St Margaret's Church of England Academy (then St Margaret's Technical Commercial School), Anfield. His first published cartoon appeared in the school magazine.Bill Tidy - Britain's Best Cartoonist After working in a shipping office Tidy joined the Royal Engineers in 1952.http://www.ashbournenewstelegraph.co.uk/King-Tidy-big-archaeology-fan- far-fossil/story-21033596-detail/story.html He sold his first cartoon to a Japanese newspaper in 1955 and in the same year left the army. He found work in a Liverpool advertising agency the following year, where he drew illustrations for advertisements in magazines. Despite having no formal artistic training, he began to sell cartoons on a freelance basis and soon left the agency to work full-time as a professional cartoonist. ==Career== As his work became better known and began to be published in the Daily Sketch and Daily Mirror, he moved to London where, together with a number of his contemporaries in Fleet Street, he formed the British Cartoonists' Association. Tidy is known for his cartoon strips — The Cloggies ran from 1967 to 1981 in the fortnightly satirical magazine Private Eye, and The Fosdyke Saga was published daily in the Daily Mirror from 1971 to 1984; the latter was a parody of The Forsyte Saga, set in the industrial north instead of a genteel upper class environment. This was broadcast as a radio series in 42 parts by the BBC from 1983, with additional scripting by John Junkin. It also became a stage play with Tidy working in co-operation with playwright Alan Plater. Tidy recently restarted producing the Fosdyke Saga cartoon strip on his own website where he also offers a variety of his works for sale. Other cartoon strip series and individual cartoons have been published in many other newspapers and magazines, including New Scientist (Grimbledon Down for 24 years), What's Brewing (CAMRA's monthly magazine), and Punch. When Punch ceased publication, Tidy attempted to buy the title. He has also written 20 books and illustrated 70. Tidy's many TV appearances have included Countdown, Watercolour Challenge, Through the Keyhole, Blankety Blank and Countryfile. His radio appearances include an accomplished performance on a 1988 edition of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, when he stood in for Barry Cryer. He wrote and presented Draw Me, a children's television series in 13 parts. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. During the 1980's and early 1990's, Tidy was a frequent celebrity guest in 'Dictionary Corner' on the long running Channel 4 gameshow Countdown. The role of the celebrity on the show was twofold: Firstly to brazenly pretend each and every round that they had managed to find word with at least the same amount of letters as the contestants. This usually manifested itself with a dismissive statement along the lines of \\"yes we got that\\", followed by a rolling of the eyes and a smug facial expression. The second function of the guest was to amuse the audience by recounting a humourous story or anecdote prior to the commercial break. Tidy was more than competent when it came to the fist task, but his efforts to entertain the audience were less successful. Typically, when it came to this segment of the show, the usual format consisted of drawing a cartoon in black marker pen on white background, whilst telling what he clearly considered to be an hilarious tale, punctuated by the images he was creating with his sharpie. Sadly, audience reaction was rarely positive; and the denouement of his monologue was more often than not met by bewilderment rather than laughter, and an awkward silence only broken by host Richard Whiteley signalling that it was 'time for a short break'. On one occasion, Whiteley seemed to take pity in Tidy and said \\"don't worry Bill, they're laughing at home\\" in an attempt to comfort the incompetent cartoonist. as the camera panned back prior to the commercial break, Tidy was seen sobbing into a butterscotch handkerchief and wiping tears from his eyes. Tidy's artistic style is similar to that of his late friend and fellow cartoonist, Larry. However, where Larry's cartoons are usually the graphic equivalent of one- liner jokes, Tidy tends to work in longer forms with verbal as well as visual humour. ==References== ==Further reading== * Tidy, Bill (autobiography).

These patients may develop infectious mononucleosis-like lesions or polyclonal polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia. Some of these B-cells may undergo mutations which will render them malignant, giving rise to a lymphoma. In some patients, the malignant cell clone can become the dominant proliferating cell type, leading to frank lymphoma, a group of B cell lymphomas occurring in immunosuppressed patients following organ transplant. ==Signs and symptoms== Symptoms of PTLD are highly variable and nonspecific, and may include fever, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Symptoms may be similar to those seen in infectious mononucleosis (caused by EBV). Pain or discomfort may result from lymphadenopathy or mass effect from growing tumors. Dysfunction may occur in organs affected by PTLD. Lung or heart involvement may result in shortness of breath. Laboratory findings may show abnormally low white blood cell, red cell counts, and platelet counts. In addition, serum uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase levels may be elevated, while serum calcium levels may be decreased. All of these findings together can suggest tumor lysis syndrome. ==Causes== The disease is an uncontrolled proliferation of B cell lymphocytes latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Production of an interleukin-10, an endogenous, pro-regulatory cytokine, has also been implicated. In immunocompetent patients, Epstein-Barr virus can cause infectious mononucleosis in adolescents, which is otherwise asymptomatic in children during their childhood. However, in immunosuppressed transplant patients, the lack of T-cell immunosurveillance can lead to the proliferation of these EBV-infected B-lymphocytes. However, calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and ciclosporin), used as immunosuppressants in organ transplantation inhibit T cell function, and can prevent the control of the B cell proliferation. Depletion of T cells by use of anti-T cell antibodies in the prevention or treatment of transplant rejection further increases the risk of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Such antibodies include ATG, ALG and OKT3 (muromonab-CD3). Polyclonal PTLD may form tumor masses and present with symptoms due to a mass effect, e.g. symptoms of bowel obstruction. Monoclonal forms of PTLD tend to form a disseminated malignant lymphoma. ==Diagnosis== Definitive diagnosis is achieved by biopsying the involved tissue, which will reveal lymphoproliferative neoplasia. Most lesions will show malignant B cells, whereas a minority will show T cell neoplasia. CT imaging may show enlarged lymph nodes or a focal mass. PET scan may be helpful in the evaluation, which may show an increase in metabolic activity (PET avid) lesion, potentially guiding decisions on where to direct biopsies. Neurologic symptoms, such as confusion or focal weakness, which may suggest involvement of the nervous system. This may be evaluated with an MRI of the brain with gadolinium based contrast and lumbar spinal tap with testing of the cerebral spinal fluid for EBV viral levels. The presence of respiratory symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breath, in the setting of immunosuppression may suggest infection. Opportunistic infections may present in a similar fashion to PTLD. Evaluation with sputum culture for bacteria, Pneumocystis carinii, and acid fast bacilli, and fungal infections are often helpful. ==Treatment== PTLD may spontaneously regress on reduction or cessation of immunosuppressant medication, and can also be treated with addition of anti-viral therapy. In some cases it will progress to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and may be fatal. A phase 2 study of adoptively transferred EBV-specific T cells demonstrated high efficacy with minimal toxicity. ==Epidemiology== PTLD is the 2nd most common malignancy that occurs as a complication following solid organ transplantation (skin cancer is the most common). Less commonly, PTLD occurs after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The incidence varies by the type of transplantation: the lowest rates are seen with bone marrow transplants and liver transplants. The highest rates of PTLD are seen with lung and heart transplants, which is primarily due to the need for higher levels of immunosuppression. The incidence of PTLD is highest in the first year after transplantation; roughly 80 percent of cases after transplant occur in the first year. Transplantation of unmatched or mismatched HLA bone marrow also increase the risk of PTLD. The main risk factors for PTLD are the degree of immune suppression and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus. Specifically, higher levels of T cell immunosuppression increase the risk PTLD. Individuals who have never been infected by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV negative) who receive an organ from a donor with prior EBV infection are 24 times more likely to develop PTLD. Similarly, CMV mismatching (with a CMV negative recipient from a CMV positive donor) increases the risk of PTLD. ==References== == External links == Category:Transplantation medicine Category:Lymphoma Category:Epstein–Barr virus-associated diseases ","title":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder"},{"id":"530369","text":"Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, 2nd Baronet, DL (29 August 1835 – 22 February 1914) was a Welsh industrialist and a member of the prominent Guest family. ==Early life== Ivor Bertie Guest was born at Dowlais, near Merthyr Tydfil, the son of Lady Charlotte Guest, translator of the Mabinogion, and Sir John Josiah Guest, 1st Baronet, owner of the world's largest iron foundry, Dowlais Ironworks.

Moriz Rosenthal (17 December 18623 September 1946) was a Polish pianist and composer. He was an outstanding pupil of Franz Liszt and a friend and colleague of some of the greatest musicians of his age, including Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss, Anton Rubinstein, Hans von Bülow, Camille Saint-Saëns, Jules Massenet and Isaac Albéniz. ==Biography== Rosenthal was born in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (later Lwów, Poland, now Lviv, Ukraine) into a Jewish family, where his father was professor at the chief academy. At eight years of age he commenced his piano studies under Galoth (1869–1872). In 1872, Rosenthal became a pupil of Karol Mikuli, Chopin's pupil and editor, who trained him along more academic lines at Lviv Conservatory. At the age of twelve he became a pupil of Rafael Joseffy in Vienna. His debut occurred in Vienna in 1876. He had immediate success and after a tour of Romania he was made Court Pianist of Romania when he was fourteen years of age. From 1878 to 1879 he studied with Liszt at Weimar and Rome. He was associated with the great Hungarian master until 1886, when Liszt died at Bayreuth. Having the conviction that a well-rounded classical education was necessary in his work as an interpreter, he studied at the Staats Gymnasium in Vienna and at the University, where he was a pupil in philosophy under Von Zimmerman and Brentano and in esthetics under Hanslick. His virtuosity guided by a probing intellect was nonpareil. In 1912 he was made Kammervirtuoso for the Emperor of Austria. As Liszt's pupil, Rosenthal made appearances in St. Petersburg, Paris, and elsewhere. His general education, however, was not neglected, and in 1880 Rosenthal qualified to take the philosophical course at the University of Vienna. Six years later he resumed his career with the piano, achieving brilliant success in Leipzig, and in Boston, where he made his U.S. debut in 1888,New York Times article, \\"Pianist at 80, Moriz Rosenthal, Who Can Look Back on Long, Distinguished Career,\\" by Olin Downes, December 13, 1942 and subsequently in England in 1895.

Rosenthal as he prepared for a Chicago Grant Park concert in 1938. His wife was also an accomplished pianist. Rosenthal recorded around three hours' worth of music between 1928 and 1942, for Columbia, Edison, Ultraphon, EMI, and RCA Victor. Several of the discs are often regarded as among the finest piano recordings from his time.Cf. Harold C. Schonberg, The Great Pianists In addition to 78-rpm records, a quantity of American Piano Company (Ampico) piano rolls also exist. Rosenthal's usually malicious wit was legendary. When he heard Vladimir Horowitz blaze through the octave passages of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto at his Vienna debut, he remarked: \\"He is an Octavian, but not Caesar.\\" In similar vein, after hearing Ignacy Jan Paderewski, whose reputation had preceded him, Rosenthal said: \\"Yes, he plays well, I suppose, but he's no Paderewski\\".Harold C. Schonberg, The Great Pianists, p. 284. A colleague once played Rosenthal's arrangement of Chopin's Minute Waltz in thirds at a recital, after which Rosenthal thanked the pianist \\"for the most enjoyable quarter of an hour of my life\\". Towards the end of his life Rosenthal lived at the Great Northern Hotel in New York, which he referred to as \\"more Northern than Great\\".Arbiter Records His pupils included Charles Rosen, Robert Goldsand, and Jorge Bolet.

Much research has also been conducted on everolimus and other mTOR inhibitors as targeted therapy for use in a number of cancers. It is the 40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl) derivative of sirolimus and works similarly to sirolimus as an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is marketed by Novartis under the trade names Zortress (USA) and Certican (European Union and other countries) in transplantation medicine, and as Afinitor (general tumours) and Votubia (tumours as a result of TSC) in oncology. Everolimus is also available from Biocon, with the brand name Evertor. ==Medical uses== Everolimus is approved for various conditions: * Advanced kidney cancer (US FDA approved in March 2009) * Prevention of organ rejection after renal transplant(US FDA April 2010) * Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) in patients who are not suitable for surgical intervention (US FDA October 2010) * Progressive or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors not surgically removable (May 2011)https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm254350.htm * Breast cancer in post-menopausal women with advanced hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative type cancer, in conjunction with exemestane (US FDA July 2012) * Prevention of organ rejection after liver transplant(Feb 2013) * Progressive, well-differentiated non-functional, neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease (US FDA February 2016).Everolimus (Afinitor). Feb 2016 * Tuberous sclerosis complex-associated partial-onset seizures for adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. (US FDA April 2018). Everolimus (Afinitor). April 2018 ==UK National Health Service== NHS England has been criticised for delays in deciding on a policy for the prescription of everolimus in the treatment of Tuberous Sclerosis. 20 doctors addressed a letter to the board in support of the charity Tuberous Scelerosis Association saying \\" around 32 patients with critical need, whose doctors believe everolimus treatment is their best or only option, have no hope of access to funding. Most have been waiting many months. Approximately half of these patients are at imminent risk of a catastrophic event (renal bleed or kidney failure) with a high risk of preventable death.\\" In May 2015 it was reported that Luke Henry and Stephanie Rudwick, the parents of a child suffering from Tuberous Sclerosis were trying to sell their home in Brighton to raise £30,000 to pay for treatment for their daughter Bethany who has tumours on her brain, kidneys and liver and suffers from up to 50 epileptic fits a day. ==Clinical trials== , Phase III trials are under way in gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma.http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news- highlights/novartis-afinitor-cleared-by-fda-for-treating-sega-tumors-in- tuberous-sclerosis/81244159/ The experimental use of everolimus in refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease was reported in 2012. Interim phase III trial results in 2011 showed that adding Afinitor (everolimus) to exemestane therapy against advanced breast cancer can significantly improve progression- free survival compared with exemestane therapy alone. A study published in 2012, shows that everolimus sensitivity varies between patients depending on their tumor genomes. A group of patients with advanced metastasic bladder carcinoma (NCT00805129) treated with everolimus revealed a single patient who had a complete response to everolimus treatment for 26 months. The researchers sequenced the genome of this patient and compared it to different reference genomes and to other patients' genomes. They found that mutations in TSC1 led to a lengthened duration of response to everolimus and to an increase in the time to cancer recurrence. The mutated TSC1 apparently had made these tumors vulnerable to treatment with everolimus. ==Mechanism== Compared with the parent compound rapamycin, everolimus is more selective for the mTORC1 protein complex, with little impact on the mTORC2 complex. This can lead to a hyper- activation of the kinase AKT via inhibition on the mTORC1 negative feedback loop, while not inhibiting the mTORC2 positive feedback to AKT. This AKT elevation can lead to longer survival in some cell types. Thus, everolimus has important effects on cell growth, cell proliferation and cell survival. Additionally, mTORC2 is believed to play an important role in glucose metabolism and the immune system, suggesting that selective inhibition of mTORC1 by drugs such as everolimus could achieve many of the benefits of rapamycin without the associated glucose intolerance and immunosuppression. TSC1 and TSC2, the genes involved in tuberous sclerosis, act as tumor suppressor genes by regulating mTORC1 activity. Thus, either the loss or inactivation of one of these genes lead to the activation of mTORC1. Everolimus binds to its protein receptor FKBP12, which directly interacts with mTORC1, inhibiting its downstream signaling. As a consequence, mRNAs that code for proteins implicated in the cell cycle and in the glycolysis process are impaired or altered, and tumor growth is inhibited. ==Adverse reactions== A trial using 10 mg/day in patients with NETs of GI or lung origin reported \\"Everolimus was discontinued for adverse reactions in 29% of patients and dose reduction or delay was required in 70% of everolimus-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of everolimus-treated patients and included 3 fatal events (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 30%) were stomatitis, infections, diarrhea, peripheral edema, fatigue and rash. The most common blood abnormalities found (incidence greater than or equal to 50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, lymphopenia, elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and fasting hyperglycemia.\\". ==Role in heart transplantation== Everolimus may have a role in heart transplantation, as it has been shown to reduce chronic allograft vasculopathy in such transplants. It also may have a similar role to sirolimus in kidney and other transplants. ==Role in liver transplantation== Although, sirolimus had generated fears over use of m-TOR inhibitors in liver transplantation recipients, due to possible early hepatic artery thrombosis and graft loss, use of everolimus in the setting of liver transplantation is promising. Jeng et al., in their study of 43 patients, concluded the safety of everolimus in the early phase after living donor liver transplantation. In their study, no hepatic artery thrombosis or wound infection was noted. Also, a possible role of everolimus in reducing the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation was correlated. A target trough level of 3 ng/mL at 3 months was shown to be beneficial in recipients with pre-transplant renal dysfunction. In their study, 6 of 9 renal failure patients showed significant recovery of renal function, whereas 3 showed further deterioration, one of whom required hemodialysis.Jeng L, Thorat A, Yang H, Yeh C-C, Chen T-H, Hsu S-C. Impact of Everolimus On the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence After Living Donor Liver Transplantation When Used in Early Stage: A Single Center Prospective Study [abstract]. Am J Transplant. 2015; 15 (suppl 3). http://www.atcmeetingabstracts.com/abstract/impact-of-everolimus-on-the- hepatocellular-carcinoma-recurrence-after-living-donor-liver-transplantation- when-used-in-early-stage-a-single-center-prospective-study/. Accessed 1 September 2015. Recently published report by Thorat et al. showed a positive impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when everolimus was used as primary immunosuppression starting as early as first week after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) surgery. In their retrospective and prospective analysis at China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan, the study cohort (n=66) was divided in two groups depending upon the postoperative immunosuppression. Group A: HCC patients that received Everolimus + Tacrolimus based immunosuppressive regimen (n=37). Group B: HCC patients that received standard Tacrolimus based immunosuppressive regimen without everolimus (n=29). The target trough level for EVR was 3 to 5 ng/ml while for TAC it was 8–10 ng/ml. The 1-year, 3-year and 4-year overall survival achieved for Group A patients (Everolimus group) was 94.95%, 86.48% and 86.48%, respectively while for Group B patients it was 82.75%, 68.96%, and 62.06%, respectively (p=0.0217). The first 12-month report of ongoing Everolimus multicenter prospective trial in LDLT (H2307 trial), Jeng LB et al. have shown a 0% recurrence of HCC in everolimus group at 12 months. Jeng LB concluded that an early introduction of everolimus + reduced tacrolimus was non-inferior to standard tacrolimus in terms of efficacy and renal function at 12 months, with HCC recurrence only in tacrolimus control patients. ==Use in vascular stents== Everolimus is used in drug-eluting coronary stents as an immunosuppressant to prevent restenosis. Abbott Vascular produce an everolimus-eluting stent (EES) called Xience Alpine. It utilizes the Multi-Link Vision cobalt chromium stent platform and Novartis' everolimus. The product is widely available globally including the US, the European Union, and Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries. Boston Scientific also market EESes, recent offerings being Promus Elite and Synergy. == Use in aging == Inhibition of mTOR, the molecular target of everolimus, extends the lifespan of model organisms including mice, and mTOR inhibition has been suggested as an anti-aging therapy. Everolimus was used in a recent clinical trial by Novartis, and short-term treatment was shown to enhance the response to the influenza vaccine in the elderly, possible by reversing immunosenescence. Everolimus treatment of mice results in reduced metabolic side effects compared to sirolimus. == See also == *Discovery and development of mTOR inhibitors == References == == Further reading == * ==External links== * Category:Antineoplastic drugs Category:Immunosuppressants Category:Macrolides Category:Novartis brands Category:Polyenes ","title":"Everolimus"},{"id":"530398","text":"The 1969 Cloggies book The Cloggies, an Everyday Saga in the Life of Clog Dancing Folk, was a long-running cartoon by Bill Tidy that ran in the satirical magazine Private Eye from 1967 to 1981, and later in The Listener from 1985 to 1986. It gently satirised northern English male culture, and introduced a shocked nation to the scurrilous delights of Lancashire clog- dancing. This particular variation of the art involved two teams dancing towards each other in formation, followed by each attempting to cripple their opponents with gracefully executed knee and foot moves. Thus the Forward Sir Percy, a synchronized low-level knee attack, the Double Arkwright wi' Ankle Lever, the Heckmondwycke with Reverse Spin and the ever controversial Triple Arkwright. Other routines included the Half Arkwright with Groin Action, the Erotic Elbow Drive and the match-winning Flying Arkwright, performed to cries of, “Keep them knees stylish!” ==The team== The Cloggies were undisputed champions of their ‘sport’, usually inflicting grave injuries before repairing to the nearest pub. Their capacity for beer was legendary; their home venue, the Clog & Bells, Blagdon, where Doris the barmaid was always in a welcoming mood. There were also unorthodox activities involving the use of ferrets. The series lampooned current sports culture and introduced an entire sub-culture of dance leagues, a governing body for the sport (characterised as officious, clumsy, bureaucratic, out-of-touch and based on the Football Association), an idiosyncratic cast of sociopaths and a yearning for earlier, gentler days of greater respect (such as the famous Policeman on a White Bicycle). As a reflection of the officious nature of league officials and umpires (who always had it in for the lads) the scoring system was deeply arcane and complex, with final scores such as 124.863 to 92 being recorded. The team consisted of: * Stan Postlethwaite (captain), later ennobled as Lord Stan of Blagdon * Albert Postlethwaite (second boot, with his false teeth) * Neville (third boot; trilby and glasses) (or Wilfrid, trilby, glasses and moustache) * Arnold (fourth boot) * Ted (fifth boot, with the grey socks) * Wally (sixth boot, later deceased, replaced by Norman). * Norman (bearded). Other unsavoury local residents included Reginald ('Reg') Thrumper, the \\"Blagdon Amateur Rapist\\" and the unnamed 'Blagdon Groper and Nuisance'. ==Origin== The cartoon that started it all ? The sub-title, an Everyday Saga in the Life of Clog Dancing Folk, parodied the subtitle to the long-running BBC radio series, The Archers, which was subtitled an Everyday Story of Country Folk. Three retrospective collections of the cartoons were published between 1969 and 1977, with titles The Cloggies (1969), The Cloggies Dance Again (1973) and The Cloggies Are Back (1977). Bill Tidy's inspiration for this series may have grown out of one of his cartoons in Punch in the mid 1960s, where he parodied the funding objectives and credibility of the Arts Council of Great Britain by illustrating a group of morris dancers in full costume, gathered around a table outside a pub, behind an enormous pile of empties, with one of them asking \\"Well lads, what are we going to do wi' rest of Arts Council grant ?\\" === Final triumph === In one cartoon, the Cloggies were selected to represent Great Britain in the 1966 International Folk Dance Festival, beating the USSR in the final despite Wally’s double hernia, and returned victorious to Blagdon with the Gold Boot of Strichtenstein. They were persuaded to turn professional by their new manager, Morris ‘Zip’ Fassner (later Shufflebottom) and embarked on a world tour before once more returning to the Clog & Bells and rejoining their local league. Their opponents included The Bull & Veterinary Surgeon, The Rat & Goldfish, The Horse & Shovel, The Truss & Slagheap, The Fox & Pervert, The Grunting Duck and Gridley’s Soap Works. In 1966, a strip showed the Cloggies winning the United Kingdom Drunk and Disorderly Shield. == The Cloggies of University Hall, Buckland Inspiration=== The 1968 Cloggies team at Buckland Although other dancers have more recently appropriated the name, The Cloggies originally took on a real life of their own in 1968 when a group of students at University Hall, Buckland in Oxfordshire, became so inspired by the cartoon characters’ pub-oriented career that they formed their own squad. Photographs from the period show the team in the following order: Stan (Pete Metcalfe), Wally (Gwyn Ellis), Neville (John Barton), Arnold (Iain Murray), Ted (Andy Carr) and Albert (Al Guyver). The shady-looking character is the manager, Morris (Mike Fernie). Arthur (Nigel Brewis), was later named as reserve boot in case of injury or hangover. Bill Tidy personally wrote to the team to officially endorse and encourage them, delighted that “all those years spent labouring on Spam have produced a debased art form”. === Live performances === The lads limber up with a Single Leg Arkwright, pursued by Morris with a contract The Cloggies performed uninvited and to mixed receptions at several college discos, offering terrifying moves such as The Forward Lunge with Curse, but their big breakthrough came when asked by producer Martin Pennock to take on the country-dancing roles in the closing scenes of John Milton’s Comus . Buckland was the smallest ever college (120 students) to enter the Sunday Times / NUS Drama competition. The preliminary round took place at Lord Faringdon’s private theatre, whose stage was just wide enough to accommodate six Cloggies dancing abreast. As the play was about to start, the lights failed so everyone settled in the pub until the power-cut ended. The adjudicator seemed much more enthusiastic two hours and several pints later, but there was a serious delay in getting the Cloggies from the bar and back on stage. Their performance was hampered by a spread of fruit and milk underfoot from the previous orgy scene and most spectators felt it was a disaster. === Final triumph === Buckland was one of eight chosen from sixty universities and colleges to travel to Southampton University for the Student Drama Festival Finals in the winter of 1970/71. After sitting through several other productions, the audience went wild when the Cloggies hit the stage at the end of Comus. The Southern Arts Review praised the ‘boisterous rustic dancing Cloggies’, while French radio covered the event, describing them as “un groupe de danseurs folkloriques” and playing a recording of them dancing to the strains of Fairport Convention’s Lark in the Morning – the boots, the bells, the yells.English Dance and Song Winter 1973 Nicholas de Jongh, drama correspondent of The Guardian, wrote that the play was ‘… degraded into a cheap grotesque pantomime’, adding that, ‘the late appearance from the dancing Cloggies underlined the cheapness of the conception.’The Guardian 4 January 1971 This was seen by the lads as a complete vindication of all they had stood for. The team’s swansong was as dancing shepherds in the British premiere of the medieval French fable Aucassin and Nicolette, translated by Alex Kerr and produced by Pennock in the college grounds on 27 June 1971. The use of a full beer crate as a prop did not interfere with the narrative. ==References== ==External links== *Bill Tidy *University Hall, Buckland Category:1967 comics debuts Category:1986 comics endings Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967 Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional dancers Category:Satirical comics Category:Humor comics Category:British comic strips Category:Culture in Lancashire Category:British comics characters ","title":"The Cloggies"},{"id":"530400","text":"Cowboys and Indians is an album by The Jeevas, released October 6, 2003. ==Track listing== All songs by Crispian Mills, unless otherwise noted. # \\"Black & Blue\\" # \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\\" (John Fogerty) # \\"Healing Hands\\" # \\"The Way You Carry On\\" # \\"I Can't Help Myself\\" # \\"Back Home\\" # \\"Que Pasa (con tu culo)?\\" # \\"How Much Do You Suck?\\" # \\"Masters of War\\" (Bob Dylan) # \\"Stoned Love\\" # \\"Girl Without a Name\\" # \\"Good Man Down\\" # \\"Rio Grande\\" Category:2003 albums ","title":"Cowboys and Indians (album)"},{"id":"530402","text":"The Dissociatives were an Australian band consisting of Daniel Johns of Silverchair, Australian dance producer DJ Paul Mac, and touring members Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes from Sydney electronic duo \\"The Presets\\", and James Haselwood.

The pair produced all the instrumental tracks and vocals themselves with Johns writing the lyrics and recording them in Newcastle. The pair described the music and lyrics in the April 2004 Australian edition of Rolling Stone. \\"The music is, for me, a combination of excitement, happiness, rambunctiousness and viciousness, done to whimsy,\\" Johns said. \\"I'd add with a hint of melancholy, but it's more outweighed by joy,\\" added Mac.

It tells the tragic story of an eccentric but brilliant book peddler, Jakob Mendel, who spends his days trading in one of Vienna's many coffeehouses. With his encyclopaedic mind and devotion to literature, the Poland-born Russian-Jewish immigrant is not only tolerated but liked and admired by both the owner of his local Café Gluck and the cultured Viennese clients with whom he interacts in the pre-war period. In 1915, however, he is falsely accused of collaborating with Austria's enemies and is dispatched to a concentration camp. On his return, towards the end of the war, everything has changed. His mind no longer remembers, his eyes can no longer read, the café undergoes new, brittle ownership, and his clientele have disappeared. Jacob Mendel finally dies, destitute, incapacitated and forgotten. What initially reads as another of the many modest human dramas that Zweig made his speciality, this small tale actually has a far more panoramic sub-plot, for it is a metaphor of World War I's impact on Viennese life and culture. It is also particularly interesting to the historian for understanding the strategies by which post-war writers re-imagined pre-war Vienna, how they conceptualised the war itself, and how memory and myth deeply influenced their conception of history. == References == * * * PushkinPress.com English editions of Stefan Zweig's novellas * Jewish Legends.

It began in 1998 growing out of a protest movement Justice for Kashmir, which first gave rise to the Justice Party and then the People's Justice Party. The PJP was centered in Birmingham, where it took City Council seats from the long-dominant Labour Party, drawing its support from Birmingham's Kashmiri population; there were some 90,000 residents of Azad Kashmiri descent in Birmingham in this period. ==History== The Party originated in a Free Riaz and Quayyam Campaign to obtain the release of two Kashmiri militants (Mohammed Riaz and Quayyam Raja) belonging to the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. The two were imprisoned in 1984 for their role in the kidnapping and killing of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre in Birmingham. The group was renamed Justice for Kashmir, then renamed People's Justice Party. On 18 November 2001, the PJP worked with Stop the War Coalition and the loosely organized Islamic Network UK to turn out a large crowd for a rally opposing military response to the 11 September attacks. Success peaked in the 2001 United Kingdom general election, when PJP garnered 13% of the votes in the neighborhoods of Small Heath and Sparkbrook, and held 5 seats on the Birmingham city council. In July 2002 the PJP suffered a heavy setback when a leading member, Khalid Mahmood (no relationship to MP for Perry Barr, Khalid Mahmood,) left to join the Labour Party. In 2003 the PJP ran as a \\"single-issue\\" party demanding that the British government pressure India in support of Muslims in Kashmir. The party platform was based on an appeal for votes on two fronts: local and international. It promised single-sex schools, changes to housing grants, and improved street lighting beside commitments to campaign for self-determination for Kashmir, the formation of a Palestinian state. In 2002 the PJP City Council member Mohammed Nazam was accused of taking part in a rowdy demonstration in which eggs were thrown at the visiting Pakistani High Commissioner. In the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, PJP treasurer Asrar Ahmad complained to the press that \\"Muslim people\\" were being blamed for the attacks without \\"proof.\\" The PJP was also active in the anti-war activity at the time of the American-led campaign against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The PJP in the Birmingham City Council was led by Shaukat Ali Khan. Ali Khan had earlier been a member of the Labour Party, as had other PJP members. These ex-Labour members formed PJP in response to what they felt was a failure by the Labour government in the UK to deal adequately with ongoing Indian and Pakistani tensions concerning Kashmir, and what they perceived as a failure to improve the lives of the Kashmiri population in Birmingham. Some people criticised the party for being focused on only one ethnic group to the exclusion of others, although the PJP itself admitted that at least half their votes come from the Birmingham Kashmiri population, it claimed to be a secular organisation. The PJP lost all of its seats in the 2004 Birmingham City Council election, but following the finding of postal vote fraud in Aston and Bordesley Green, by-elections were held in both the wards in July 2005 with the PJP seeing two of its three candidates—Shaukat Ali Khan and Mohammed Saeed—elected in Bordesley Green. The party was dissolved in March 2006, with many of its members, including both Councillors, joining the Liberal Democrats. The PJP group leader Shaukat Ali Khan said talks about disbanding the party began when members worked closely with the Liberal Democrats to expose New Labour's postal vote fraud in Aston and Bordesley Green. The founder members were Allah Ditta, Raja Skintaj and Rajasab Ali of Azad Kashmir. The idea of a new party that appealed to the foreign policy concerns of Muslim voters was replicated by the Respect Party, founded in 2004. ==See also== * Azad Kashmiri diaspora * Kashmir conflict ==References== ==External links== *Council Lib Dems joined by PJP pair News announcing the disbanding of the People's Justice Party and its joining the Liberal Democrats; 13 March 2006 Category:Islamic organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Political parties established in 1998 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2006 Category:Defunct political parties in the United Kingdom Category:Pakistani diaspora in the United Kingdom Category:1998 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2006 disestablishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"People's Justice Party (UK)"},{"id":"530413","text":"The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), also known as the \\"Digital Telephony Act,\\" is a United States wiretapping law passed in 1994, during the presidency of Bill Clinton (Pub. L. No. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279, codified at 47 USC 1001-1010). CALEA's purpose is to enhance the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct lawful interception of communication by requiring that telecommunications carriers and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment modify and design their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure that they have built-in capabilities for targeted surveillance, allowing federal agencies to selectively wiretap any telephone traffic; it has since been extended to cover broadband Internet and VoIP traffic. Some government agencies argue that it covers mass surveillance of communications rather than just tapping specific lines and that not all CALEA- based access requires a warrant. The original reason for adopting CALEA was the Federal Bureau of Investigation's worry that increasing use of digital telephone exchange switches would make tapping phones at the phone company's central office harder and slower to execute, or in some cases impossible. Since the original requirement to add CALEA-compliant interfaces required phone companies to modify or replace hardware and software in their systems, U.S. Congress included funding for a limited time period to cover such network upgrades. CALEA was passed into law on October 25, 1994 and came into force on January 1, 1995. In the years since CALEA was passed it has been greatly expanded to include all VoIP and broadband Internet traffic. From 2004 to 2007 there was a 62 percent growth in the number of wiretaps performed under CALEAand more than 3,000 percent growth in interception of Internet data such as email. By 2007, the FBI had spent $39 million on its Digital Collection System Network (DCSNet) system, which collects, stores, indexes, and analyzes communications data. == Provisions of CALEA == In its own words, the purpose of CALEA is: :To amend title 18, United States Code, to make clear a telecommunications carrier's duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for Law Enforcement purposes, and for other purposes. The U.S. Congress passed the CALEA to aid law enforcement in its effort to conduct criminal investigations requiring wiretapping of digital telephone networks. The Act obliges telecommunications companies to make it possible for law enforcement agencies to tap any phone conversations carried out over its networks, as well as making call detail records available. The act stipulates that it must not be possible for a person to detect that his or her conversation is being monitored by the respective government agency. Common carriers, facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, and providers of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) serviceall three types of entities are defined to be “telecommunications carriers” and must meet the requirements of CALEA. The CALEA Implementation Unit at the FBI has clarified that intercepted information is supposed to be sent to Law Enforcement concurrently with its capture. On March 10, 2004, the United States Department of Justice, FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration filed a \\"Joint Petition for Expedited Rulemaking\\"http://www.askcalea.com/docs/20040310.calea.jper.pdf in which they requested certain steps to accelerate CALEA compliance, and to extend the provisions of CALEA to include the ability to perform surveillance of all communications that travel over the Internetsuch as Internet traffic and VoIP. As a result, the FCC adopted a \\"First Report and Order\\" concluding that CALEA applies to facilities-based broadband Internet access providers and providers of interconnected (with the public switched telephone network) Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) services. In May 2006, the FCC adopted a \\"Second Report and Order\\", which clarified and affirmed the First Order: * The CALEA compliance deadline remains May 14, 2007. * Carriers are permitted to meet their CALEA obligations through the services of \\"Trusted Third Parties (TTP)\\"that is, they can hire outside companies, which meet security requirements outlined in CALEA, to perform all of the required functions. * Carriers are responsible for CALEA development and implementation costs. == Technical implementation == For Voice and Text messaging, CALEA software in the central office enables wiretap. If a call comes in for a number on the target phone a \\"conference bridge\\" is created and the second leg is sent to law enforcement at the place of their choosing. By law this must be outside of phone company. This prevents law enforcement from being inside the phone company and possibly illegally tapping other phones. Text messages are also sent to law enforcement. There are two levels of CALEA wiretapping: * The first level only allows that the \\"meta data\\" about a call be sent. That is the parties to the call, the time of the call and for cell phones, the cell tower being used by the target phone. For text message, the same information is sent but the content is not sent. This level is called \\"Trap and Trace\\". * The second level of CALEA wiretap, when permitted, actually sends the voice and content of text messages. This is called \\"Title III\\" wiretap. USA telecommunications providers must install new hardware or software, as well as modify old equipment, so that it doesn't interfere with the ability of a law enforcement agency (LEA) to perform real-time surveillance of any telephone or Internet traffic. Modern voice switches now have this capability built in, yet Internet equipment almost always requires some kind of intelligent deep packet inspection probe to get the job done. In both cases, the intercept function must single out a subscriber named in a warrant for intercept and then immediately send some (headers-only) or all (full content) of the intercepted data to an LEA. The LEA will then process this data with analysis software that is specialized towards criminal investigations. All traditional voice switches on the U.S. market today have the CALEA intercept feature built in. The IP-based \\"soft switches\\" typically do not contain a built-in CALEA intercept feature; and other IP-transport elements (routers, switches, access multiplexers) almost always delegate the CALEA function to elements dedicated to inspecting and intercepting traffic. In such cases, hardware taps or switch/router mirror-ports are employed to deliver copies of all of a network's data to dedicated IP probes. Probes can either send directly to the LEA according to the industry standard delivery formats (c.f. ATIS T1.IAS, T1.678v2, et al.); or they can deliver to an intermediate element called a mediation device, where the mediation device does the formatting and communication of the data to the LEA. A probe that can send the correctly formatted data to the LEA is called a \\"self-contained\\" probe. In order to be compliant, IP-based service providers (broadband, cable, VoIP) must choose either a self-contained probe, or a \\"dumb\\" probe component plus a mediation device, or they must implement the delivery of correctly formatted data for a named subscriber on their own. == Controversy == The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) warns that: * CALEA makes US software and hardware less attractive for worldwide consumers. * CALEA is a reason to move research and development out of the US. * CALEA-free devices will probably be available in the gray market. Journalist Marc Zwillinger from the Wall Street Journal explains his concerns with proposed revisions to the CALEA that would require Internet companies to provide law enforcement with a method of gaining access to communication on their networks. Zwillinger warns this new mandatory access could create a dangerous situation for multinational companies not being able to refuse demands from foreign governments. This governments could “threaten financial sanctions, asset seizures, imprisonment of employees and prohibition against a company’s services in their countries.\\" In addition, the creation of this new mechanism could create an easier way for hackers to gain access to the U.S. government's key. Moreover, the U.S. telephone network and the global internet differ in that U.S. telephone carriers “weren’t responsible for decrypting communications unless the carrier possessed the decryption key. In fact, CALEA’s legislative history is full of assurances that the Department of Justice and FBI had no intention to require providers to decrypt communications for which they did not have the key.” Therefore, a revision of the CALEA cannot necessarily secure companies from providing data on their devices during criminal investigations to foreign governments. == Lawsuits == Originally CALEA only granted the ability to wiretap digital telephone networks, but in 2004, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) filed a joint petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to expand their powers to include the ability to monitor VoIP and broadband Internet communicationsso that they could monitor Web traffic as well as phone calls. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed several lawsuits to prevent the FCC from granting these expanded domestic surveillance capabilities. The FCC's First Report and Order, issued in September 2005, ruled that providers of broadband Internet access and interconnected VoIP services are regulable as “telecommunications carriers” under CALEA. That order was affirmed and further clarified by the Second Report and Order, dated May 2006. On May 5, 2006, a group of higher education and library organizations led by the American Council on Education (ACE) challenged that ruling, arguing that the FCC's interpretation of CALEA was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. However, on June 9, 2006, the D.C. Circuit Court disagreed and summarily denied the petition.American Council on Education vs. FCC, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Decision 05-1404(pdf) June 9, 2006 == See also == * Carnivore (FBI) * NSA ANT catalog * Tempora * DCSNET * ECHELON * Hepting v.

The series, created by Daniel Knauf, ran for two seasons between 2003 and 2005. In tracing the lives of disparate groups of people in a traveling carnival, Knauf's story combined a bleak atmosphere with elements of the surreal in portraying struggles between good and evil and between free will and destiny. The show's mythology drew upon themes and motifs from traditional Christianity and gnosticism together with Masonic lore, particularly that of the Knights Templar order. Carnivàle was produced by HBO and aired between September 14, 2003, and March 27, 2005. Its creator, Daniel Knauf, also served as executive producer along with Ronald D. Moore and Howard Klein. Jeff Beal composed the original incidental music. Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown starred as Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, respectively. The show was filmed in Santa Clarita, California and nearby Southern California locations. Early reviews praised Carnivàle for style and originality but questioned the approach and execution of the story. The first episode set an audience record for an HBO original series and drew durable ratings through the first season. When the series proved unable to sustain these ratings in its second season, the series was cancelled. An intended six- season run was thus cut short by four seasons. In all, 24 episodes of Carnivàle were broadcast. In 2004 the series won five Emmys out of fifteen nominations. The show received numerous other nominations and awards between 2004 and 2006. == Episodes == The two seasons of Carnivàle take place in the Depression-era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that slowly converge. The first involves a young man with strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who joins a traveling carnival when it passes near his home in Milfay, Oklahoma. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surrealistic dreams and visions, which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben's own. The second plotline revolves around a Father Coughlin-esque Methodist preacher, Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown), who lives with his sister Iris (Amy Madigan) in California. He shares Ben's prophetic dreams and slowly discovers the extent of his own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his will and making their sins and greatest evils manifest as terrifying visions. Certain that he is doing God's work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are inexorably drawing closer. == Production  Conception === Show creator Daniel Knauf Daniel Knauf conceived the initial script for the show between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with his job as a Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks. Knauf named the intended feature film script Carnivàle, using an unusual spelling for a more outlandish look. Knauf had plotted the story's broad strokes as well as several plot details from early on and knew the story destination until the final scene. However, the resulting 180-page long script was twice the length of a typical feature film script, and Knauf still felt that it was too short to do his story justice. He therefore shelved the screenplay as a learning experience. In the meantime, Hollywood studios rejected all but one of Knauf's other scripts, often for being \\"too weird.\\" In the mid-1990s, Knauf met a few Writers Guild TV writers who encouraged him to revise Carnivàle as a TV series. Knauf turned the script's first act into a pilot episode, but, having no contacts in the television business, he was forced to shelve the project again and return to his regular job. A few years later, after realizing that his insurance career was not working out, he decided to give his screenwriting efforts a last chance by offering the Carnivàle pilot on his website. The script was subsequently forwarded to Howard Klein by Scott Winant, a mutual friend of the two men. After several meetings and conversations, Klein felt confident that Carnivàle would make a good episodic television series that could last for many years. Klein brought it to the attention of Chris Albrecht and Carolyn Strauss of HBO, who were immediately receptive. The network deemed Knauf too inexperienced in the television business to give him full control over the budget, and appointed Ronald D. Moore as showrunner. (Knauf replaced Moore after one season when Moore left for the reimagined Battlestar Galactica.) The pilot episode, which was filmed over a period of 21 days, served as the basis for additional tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among the writers and the network, leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months. One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin's side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that there was no room for Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin's role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch (striptease) family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s. === Format === The Carnivàle story was originally intended to be a trilogy of \\"books\\", consisting of two seasons each. This plan did not come to fruition, as HBO canceled the show after the first two seasons. Each season consists of twelve episodes. Airing on HBO benefited Carnivàle in several ways. Because HBO does not rely on commercial breaks, Carnivàle had the artistic freedom to vary in episode length. Although the episodes averaged a runtime of 54 minutes, the episodes \\"Insomnia\\" and \\"Old Cherry Blossom Road\\" were 46 minutes and 59 minutes, respectively. HBO budgeted approximately US$4 million for each episode, considerably more than most television series receive. === Historical production design === Carnivàle 1930s' Dust Bowl setting required significant research and historical consultants to be convincing, which was made possible with HBO's strong financial backing. As a result, reviews praised the look and production design of the show as \\"impeccable,\\" \\"spectacular\\" and as \\"an absolute visual stunner.\\" In 2004, Carnivàle won four Emmys for art direction, cinematography, costumes, and hairstyling. To give a sense of the dry and dusty environment of the Dust Bowl, smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set. The actors' clothes were ragged and drenched in dirt, and Carnivàle had approximately 5,000 people costumed in the show's first season alone. The creative team listened to 1930s' music and radio and read old Hollywood magazines to get the period's sound, language, and slang right. The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs, among them an original 1934 Sears Catalog, which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores. The East European background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin's story were incorporated into the show. Aside from the show's supernatural elements, a historical consultant deemed Carnivàle historical accuracy to be excellent regarding the characters' lives and clothes, their food and accommodations, their cars and all the material culture. === Filming locations === Carnivàle interiors were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita, California, while the show's many exterior scenes were filmed on Southern California locations. The scenes of fictional California town of Mintern, where the stories about Brother Justin and Iris in Season 1 were based, were shot at Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills. The carnival set itself was moved around the greater Southern California area, to movie ranches and to Lancaster, which were to replicate the states of Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. The permanent filming location of the carnival in Season2 was Big Sky Ranch, which was also used for Brother Justin's new home in fictional New Canaan. === Opening title sequence === Carnivàle opening title sequence was created by A52, a visual effects and design company based in Los Angeles, and featured music composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman. The opening title sequence won an Emmy for \\"Outstanding Main Title Design\\" in 2004. One frame of Carnivàle opening title sequence The production team of A52 had intended to \\"create a title sequence that grounded viewers in the mid-1930s, but that also allowed people to feel a larger presence of good and evil over all of time.\\" In early 2003, A52 pitched their idea to Carnivàle executives, who felt that the company's proposal was the most creative for the series' concept. The actual production included scanned transparencies of famous pieces of artwork, each scanned transparency being up to 300 MB in size. The resulting images were photoshopped and digitally rendered. A last step involved stock footage clips being compiled and digitally incorporated into the sequence. The opening title sequence itself begins with a deck of Tarot cards falling into the sand, while the camera moves in and enters one card into a separate world presenting layers of artwork and footage from iconic moments of the American Depression era; the camera then moves back out of a different card and repeats the procedure several times. The sequence ends with the camera shifting from the \\"Judgement\\" Tarot card to the \\"Moon\\" and the \\"Sun\\", identifying the Devil and God respectively, until the wind blows away all cards and the underlying sand to reveal the Carnivàle title artwork. === Music === Carnivàle features instrumental music composed by Jeff Beal, as well as many popular or obscure songs from the 1920s and 1930s, the time when Carnivàle story takes place. However, \\"After the Ball,\\" which was a major hit in the 1890s, is used to prominent effect at the close of season 1, episode 2.Music log from season 1, episode 2, \\"After the Ball Is Over\\" The main title was written by The Revolution members Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, and was released with selected themes by Jeff Beal on a Carnivàle television soundtrack by the record label Varèse Sarabande on December 7, 2004. Beal released tracks of Season2 on his personal website. A complete list of music credits is available on the official HBO website. Jeff Beal's score is primarily acoustic sounding electronics, but mixes themes of bluegrass as well as atmospheric rhythmic sounds. Bigger groups of strings support smaller ensembles of guitars, pianos, violins, cellos, and trumpets. The music sometimes uses ethnic instruments such as banjos, harmonicas, ukuleles, and duduks. Because HBO does not break individual episodes with commercials, Carnivàle music is paced similar to a movie, with character-specific leitmotifs from as early as the first episode. Characters are musically identified by solo instruments chosen for the character's ethnic background or nature. Some characters whose connections are only disclosed later in the series have intentionally similar themes. Different music is consciously used to represent the two different worlds of the story. Brother Justin's world features music of constructed orchestral sound with religious music and instruments. On the other hand, the score of the carnival side is more deconstructed and mystical, especially when the carnival travels through the Dust Bowl and remote towns. For carnival scenes taking place in the cootch (striptease) show or in cities, however, contemporary pop music, blues, folk, and ethnic music is played. One of the most defining songs of Carnivàle is the 1920s song \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\" sung by Ruth Etting, which is used in several episodes to tie characters in the two worlds thematically. == Cast == From left to right – front row: Lodz, Lila, Libby, Caladonia and Alexandria, Apollonia, Sofie, Ben Hawkins, Jonesy, Iris, Brother Justin – back row: Dora Mae, Rita Sue, Stumpy, Ruthie, Gecko, Samson The plot of Carnivàle takes place in the 1930s Dust Bowl and revolves around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher. Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season, 15 were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to 13 main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers are benefited with more flexibility in story decisions. The backgrounds of most characters were fully developed before the filming of Carnivàle began but were not part of the show's visible structure. The audience therefore only learned more about the characters as a natural aspect in the story. Season 1's first storyline is led by Nick Stahl portraying the protagonist Ben Hawkins, a young Okie farmer who joins a traveling carnival. Michael J. Anderson played Samson, the diminutive manager of the carnival. Tim DeKay portrayed Clayton \\"Jonesy\\" Jones, the crippled chief roustabout. Patrick Bauchau acted as the carnival's blind mentalist Lodz, while Debra Christofferson played his lover, Lila the Bearded Lady. Diane Salinger portrayed the catatonic fortune teller Apollonia, and Clea DuVall acted as her tarot-card-reading daughter, Sofie. Adrienne Barbeau portrayed the snake charmer Ruthie, with Brian Turk as her son Gabriel, a strongman. John Fleck played Gecko the Lizard Man, and Karyne and Sarah Steben appeared as the conjoined twins Alexandria and Caladonia. The cootch show Dreifuss family was played by Toby Huss and Cynthia Ettinger as Felix \\"Stumpy\\" and Rita Sue, and Carla Gallo as their daughter Libby. Amanda Aday portrayed their other daughter, Dora Mae Dreifuss, in a recurring role. John Savage played the mysterious Henry Scudder in several episodes, while Linda Hunt lent her voice to the mysterious Management. The second storyline is led by Clancy Brown portraying the primary antagonist, the Methodist minister Brother Justin Crowe. Amy Madigan played his sister Iris. Robert Knepper supported them as the successful radio host Tommy Dolan later in the first season, while Ralph Waite had a recurring role as Reverend Norman Balthus, Brother Justin's mentor. K Callan performed in a recurring role as Eleanor McGill, a parishioner who became devoted to Brother Justin after seeing his power firsthand. Several cast changes took place in Season 2, some of them planned from the beginning. John Fleck, Karyne Steben and her sister Sarah had made their last appearance in the first season's finale, while Patrick Bauchau's and Diane Salinger's status was reduced to guest-starring. Ralph Waite joined the regular cast. Several new characters were introduced in recurring roles, most notably John Carroll Lynch as the escaped convict Varlyn Stroud and Bree Walker as Sabina the Scorpion Lady. === Casting === The casting approach for Carnivàle was to cast the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàle casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions such as for Adrienne Barbeau as Ruthie. The script for the pilot episode was the basis for the casting procedure, with little indication where the show went afterwards. This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers, especially for leading characters such as Ben, Brother Justin and Sofie. The character of Ben was always intended to be the leading man and hero of the series, yet he was also desired to display a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality; Nick Stahl had the strongest consensus among the producers. The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic gypsy girl, but Clea DuVall, a movie actor like Stahl, got the part after four auditions. Tim DeKay was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a \\"very American\\" looking baseball player of that period. One of the few actors who never had any real competition was Michael J. Anderson as Samson, whom Daniel Knauf had wanted as early as the initial meeting. == Mythology == Although almost every Carnivàle episode has a distinctive story with a new carnival setting, all episodes are part of an overarching good-versus-evil story that only culminates and resolves very late in Season 2. The pilot episode begins with a prologue talking of \\"a creature of light and a creature of darkness\\" (also known as Avatars) being born \\"to each generation\\" preparing for a final battle. Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, and makes the nature of suggested Avatars a central question. Reviewers believed Ben to be a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dust Bowl and humankind's first nuclear test. The writers had established a groundwork for story arcs, character biographies and genealogical character links before filming of the seasons began, but many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. While Ronald D. Moore was confident that Carnivàle was one of the most complicated shows on television, Daniel Knauf reassured critics that Carnivàle was intended to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext and admitted that \\"you may not understand everything that goes on but it does make a certain sense\\". Knauf provided hints about the show's mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle, and left fans a production summary of Carnivàle first season two years after cancellation. Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carnivàle \\"the perfect show for those who thought Twin Peaks was too accessible\\". The Australian said Carnivàle \\"seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms\\" which \\"can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television.\\" A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as \\"too artsy and esoteric\\" because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding \\"what the heck was going on, [which] can be a problem for a dramatic television series.\\" TV Zone however considered Carnivàle \\"a series like no other and [...] the fact that it is so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths.\\" Carnivàle was lauded for bringing \\"the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life\\" and for being among the first TV shows to show \\"unmitigated pain and disappointment\\", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the \\"slowly unfolding sadness\\" appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show. == Cancellation and future == At the time, HBO made their commitments for only one year at a time, a third season would have meant opening up a new two- season book in Daniel Knauf's six-year plan, including the introduction of new storylines for current and new characters, and further clarification and elaboration on the show's mythology. HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2 million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them. The cancellation resulted in several story plot lines being unfinished, and outraged loyal viewers organized petitions and mailing drives to get the show renewed. This generated more than 50,000 emails to the network in a single weekend. Show creator Daniel Knauf was unconvinced of the success of such measures, but explained that proposed alternatives like selling Carnivàle to a competing network or spinning off the story were not possible because of HBO owning Carnivàle plot and characters. At the same time, Knauf was hopeful that, given a strong enough fan base, HBO might reconsider the show's future and allow the continuation of the show in another medium; but because of the amount of unused story material he still had, Knauf did not favor finishing the Carnivàle story with a three-hour movie. Knauf did not release a detailed run-down of intended future plots to fans, explaining that his stories are a collaboration of writers, directors and actors alike. He and the producers did, however, answer a few basic details about the immediate fate of major characters who were left in near-fatal situations in the final episode of Season 2. Knauf additionally provided in-depth information regarding the underlying fictional laws of nature that the writers had not been able to fully explore in the first two seasons. June 2007 however marked the first time that a comprehensive work of detailed character backgrounds was made public. Following a fundraising auction, Knauf offered fans a so-called \\"Pitch Document,\\" a summary of Carnivàle first season. This document was originally written in 2002 and 2003 to give the writers and the studio an idea about the series' intended plot, and answered many of the show's mysteries. == Marketing and merchandise  Pre-broadcast marketing === HBO reportedly invested in Carnivàle promotion as much as for any of its primetime series launches. The series' unconventional and complex narrative made the network deviate from its traditional marketing strategies. Teaser trailers were inserted on CD-ROMs into Entertainment Weekly issues to draw attention to the show's visual quality. 30-second TV spots were aired in national syndication, cable and local avails for four weeks before the show's premiere instead of the usual seven days. The historical context of Carnivàle was deliberately emphasized in the show's print art, which depicted the 17-member cast surrounding a carnival truck. This image was accompanied by a tagline of the show's good versus evil theme: \\"Into each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.\\" These measures were hoped to be backed up by positive critical reviews. To give ratings an initial boost, HBO placed the premiere of Carnivàle directly after the series finale of the successful Sex and the City. The series continued to receive extensive online advertisement for almost its entire run. === Games === Personalized and interactive online games inspired by tarot divination were created for Carnivàle internet presence. The official HBO website collaborated with RealNetworks to offer FATE: The Carnivàle Game, a downloadable game made available for trial and for purchase. === DVDs === Carnivàle: The Complete First Season was released as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on December 7, 2004, one month before the premiere of the second season. It was distributed by HBO Home Video and contained three audio commentaries and a behind-the-scenes featurette. The outer slipcover of the Region 1 set was made of a thick cardboard to mimic a bound book. The same set was released with less elaborate packaging in Region 2 on March 7, 2005, and in Region 4 on May 11, 2005. Carnivàle: The Complete Second Season was released as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on July 18, 2006, in Region 2 on August 7, 2006, and in Region 4 on October 4, 2006. Each of these releases was distributed by HBO Home Video and contained three audio commentaries, on-stage interviews of the cast and producers, a featurette about the mythology of the series, and four short \\"Creating the Scene\\" segments about the concept, inspiration and execution process. == Reception  Ratings === Carnivàle aired on HBO on a Sunday 9:00 pm timeslot during its two-season run between 2003 and 2005. \\"Milfay\\", Carnivàle pilot episode, drew 5.3 million viewers for its premiere on September 14, 2003. This marked the best ever debut for an HBO original series at the time, caused in part by the established HBO series Sex and the City being Carnivàle lead-in. This record was broken on March 21, 2004 by HBO series Deadwood, which debuted with 5.8 million viewers as the lead-out of The Sopranos. Viewership dropped to 3.49 million for Carnivàle second episode but remained stable for the remainder of the season. The final episode of season one finished with 3.5 million viewers on November 30, 2003. Season one averaged 3.54 million viewers and a household rating of 2.41. Viewership for the second-season premiere on January 9, 2005 was down by two-thirds to 1.81 million. The ratings never recovered to their first-season highs, although the season two finale experienced an upswing with 2.40 million viewers on March 27, 2005. Season 2 averaged 1.7 million viewers, not enough to avert an imminent cancellation. === Critical reviews === Many early reviews gave Carnivàle good marks but also said its unique characters and story might prevent it from becoming a huge mainstream audience success. Daily Variety TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that \\"it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be put off by the general weirdness of the show.\\" Phil Gallo of Variety described Carnivàle as \\"an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak show characters—but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point,\\" and Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times suggested that \\"it's as if executives at the premium cable network want to see how far they can slow a narrative before viewers start tossing their remotes through the screen\\". James Poniewozik of Time called the first three episodes \\"frustrating\\" as well as \\"spellbinding.\\" Amanda Murray of BBC said \\"With so little revealed, it's almost impossible to pass judgment on the show—it's hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great.\\" Later reviews were able to judge the series based on full seasons. While the acting, set design, costuming, art direction and cinematography continued to be praised, some reviewers disfavored the writing, especially of Season 1, saying \\"the plot momentum is often virtually non-existent\\" or as \\"sometimes gripping but mostly boring.\\" Other reviewers pointed out that Carnivàle may \\"demand more from its audience than many are willing to invest. [...] Without paying close attention, it's tempting to assume that the show is unnecessarily cryptic and misleading.\\" Carnivàle story was surveyed as long and complex, \\"and if you don't start from the beginning, you'll be completely lost.\\" IGN DVD's Matt Casamassina, however, praised the show in two reviews, writing that the \\"gorgeously surreal\\" first season \\"dazzles with unpredictable plot twists and scares\\", and the \\"extraordinary\\" second season was \\"better fantasy – better entertainment, period – than any show that dares to call itself a competitor.\\" A significant portion of reviews drew parallels between Carnivàle and David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks, a show in which Carnivàle actor Michael J. Anderson had previously appeared. Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath. When Lost began to receive major critical attention, Carnivàle and its type of mythological storytelling were compared to Lost story approach in several instances. Critical opinion remained divided about Carnivàle in the years after the show's cancellation. Alessandra Stanley of the Australian newspaper The Age remembers Carnivàle as a \\"smart, ambitious series that move[s] unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively and even with grace, but that never quite quit the surly bonds of serial drama.\\" Varietys Brian Lowry remembers the show as \\"largely a macabre fantasy\\" that eventually suffered from \\"its own bleakness and eccentricities\\". The A.V. Club dwelled on Carnivàles cliffhanger ending in a piece on unanswered TV questions and called the show \\"a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology\\". === Fandom === Actor Michael J. Anderson (Samson) at CarnyCon 2006\\\\. Like other cult television shows, Carnivàle gained a respectable following of dedicated viewers. Carnivàle fans referred to themselves as \\"Carnies\\" or \\"Rousties\\" (roustabouts), terms adopted from the show. Carnivàle complexity and subliminal mythology spawned dedicated fansites, although most discussion took place on independent internet forums. Show creator Daniel Knauf actively participated in online fandom and offered story- and mythology-related clues. He also gave insight into reasons for Carnivàle cancellation on a messageboard before speaking to the press. One year after Carnivàle cancellation, a major Carnivàle convention called CarnyCon 2006 Live! was organized by fans. It took place in Woodland Hills, California on August 21–23, 2006. Many of the show's cast and crew attended the event and participated in discussion panels, which were recorded and made available on DVD afterwards. === Awards === Despite its short two-season run, Carnivàle received numerous awards and nominations. The show's inaugural season received nominations for seven Emmy Awards in 2004, winning five including \\"Outstanding Art Direction For A Single-camera Series\\" and \\"Outstanding Costumes For A Series\\" for the pilot episode \\"Milfay\\", \\"Outstanding Cinematography For A Single-Camera Series\\" for the episode \\"Pick A Number\\", \\"Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series\\" for the episode \\"After the Ball Is Over\\", and \\"Outstanding Main Title Design\\". In 2005, the second season received eight further Emmy nominations without a win. Other awards include but are not limited to: * Win – Artios Award: \\"Best Casting for TV, Dramatic Pilot\\", 2004 * Win – VES Award: \\"Outstanding Special Effects in Service to Visual Effects in a Televised Program, Music Video or Commercial\\", 2004 * Win – Costume Designers Guild Award: \\"Excellence in Costume Design for Television – Period/Fantasy\\", 2005 * Nominated – two Golden Reel Awards, 2003 * Nominated – two Saturn Awards, 2004 * Nominated – two VES Awards, 2004 * Nominated – Costume Designers Guild Award, 2005 === International reception and broadcasters === HBO president Chris Albrecht said Carnivàle was \\"not a big show for foreign [distribution],\\" but did not go into more detail. Reviews however indicate that the show's cryptic mythology and inaccessibility to the casual viewer were major factors. Nevertheless, Carnivàle was sold to several foreign networks and was distributed to HBO channels abroad. The DVD releases of Carnivàle extended the availability of the show further. == Lawsuit == On June 9, 2005, a lawsuit was filed in United States district court by Los Angeles writer Jeff Bergquist. He claimed that the creators of Carnivàle did not originate the idea for the show, but rather stole it from his unpublished novel Beulah, a quirky drama set amid a traveling carnival during the Depression that Bergquist had been working on since the 1980s. Bergquist sought both recognition and punitive damages by arguing that HBO and Carnivàle creator Daniel Knauf violated his copyright on Beulah, but HBO and Knauf denied any claims as having \\"absolutely no merit.\\" == References == == External links == * * Category:2000s American drama television series Category:2003 American television series debuts Category:2005 American television series endings Category:Circus television shows Category:English- language television shows Category:American fantasy television series Category:Religious drama television series Category:Great Depression television series Category:HBO original programming Category:TV series involved in plagiarism controversies Category:Serial drama television series Category:Television series set in the 1930s Category:Television shows set in the United States Category:Television shows set in Oklahoma Category:Television series by 3 Arts Entertainment Category:Fictional rivalries ","title":"Carnivàle"},{"id":"530422","text":"John Stevens Henslow (6 February 1796 – 16 May 1861) was a British priest, botanist and geologist. He is best remembered as friend and mentor to his pupil Charles Darwin. == Early life == Henslow was born at Rochester, Kent, the son of a solicitor John Prentis Henslow, who was the son of John Henslow. Henslow was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge where he graduated as 16th wrangler in 1818, the year in which Adam Sedgwick became Woodwardian Professor of Geology. == Early career == Heslow's Geological map of Anglesey 1822Henslow graduated in 1818. He already had a passion for natural history from his childhood, which largely influenced his career, and he accompanied Sedgwick in 1819 on a tour in the Isle of Wight where he learned his first lessons in geology. He also studied chemistry under Professor James Cumming and mineralogy under Edward Daniel Clarke. In the autumn of 1819 he made valuable observations on the geology of the Isle of Man (Trans. Geol. Soc., 1821) and in 1820 and 1821 he investigated the geology of parts of Anglesey, the results being printed in the first volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (1822).Henslow (1822) The Philosophical Society was founded in November 1819 by a group at Cambridge with Professors Farish, Lee, and Sedgwick and Henslow (at that time not yet a professor). The idea and initial impetus for the society originated from Sedgwick and Henslow. Meanwhile, Henslow had studied mineralogy with considerable zeal, so that on the death of Clarke he was in 1822 appointed professor of mineralogy in the University of Cambridge. Two years later he took holy orders. Botany, however, had claimed much of his attention, and to this science he became more and more attached, so that he gladly resigned the chair of mineralogy in 1827, two years after becoming professor of botany. As a teacher both in the classroom and in the field he was eminently successful. He was a correspondent of John James Audubon who in 1829 named Henslow's sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) after him. From 1821 Henslow had begun organising a herbarium of British flora, supplementing his own collecting with a network which expanded over time to include his friends and family, and the botanists William Jackson Hooker and John Hutton Balfour, as well as about 30 of his students. As a mineralogist he had used Haüy's laws of crystallography to analyse complex crystals as transformations of \\"the primitive form of the species\\" of crystal, and when he moved to botany in 1825 he sought similarly precise laws to group plant varieties into species, often including as varieties plants that respected taxonomists had ranked as separate species. He followed the understanding of the time that species were fixed as created but could vary within limits, and hoped to analyse these limits of variation. By a method he called \\"collation\\", Henslow prepared sheets with several plant specimens, each labelled with the collector, date and place of collection, comparing the specimens to show the variation within the species. His A Catalogue of British Plants was first published in October 1829, and became a set book for his lecture course. Henslow is best remembered as friend and mentor to his pupil Charles Darwin, and for inspiring him with a passion for natural history. The two met in 1828. Earlier that year, Darwin joined the course and along with other students helped to collect plants of Cambridgeshire. Henslow became his tutor, and it was not long before he marked out Darwin as a promising student. In 1830 Henslow experimented on varying the conditions of garden grown wild plants to produce various forms of the plant. In 1835 Henslow published Principles of Descriptive and Physiological Botany as a textbook based on this lecture course. In the summer of 1831 Henslow was offered a place as naturalist to sail aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle on a two-year voyage to survey South America, but his wife dissuaded him from accepting. Seeing a perfect opportunity for his protégé, Henslow wrote to the ship's captain Robert Fitzroy telling him that Darwin was the ideal man to join the expedition team. During the voyage, Darwin corresponded with Henslow, and collected plants with him in mind. In particular, when first arriving at the Galápagos Islands Darwin noted \\"I certainly recognize S America in Ornithology, would a botanist?\\", and went on to collect plant specimens carefully labelled by island and date. He also labelled the mockingbirds he caught, and initially thought these were varieties but while arranging these bird specimens on the last lap of the voyage he began wondering if they could be species, a possibility which would \\"undermine the stability of Species\\". Henslow's teaching continued to influence Darwin's work on evolution. Besides Darwin, other famous students of Henslow included Miles Joseph Berkeley, Cardale Babington, Leonard Jenyns,Dictionary of National Biography, 1901 supplement, \\"Jenyns, Leonard\\" Richard Thomas Lowe and William Hallowes Miller. == A country clergyman == In 1833 Henslow was appointed vicar of Cholsey-cum- Moulsford in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He continued to live in Cambridge, only visiting the parish during vacations; he appointed a curate to conduct services and parish business during term-time.Walters and Stow 2001, p. 111 However, his appointment in 1837 to the remunerative Crown living at Hitcham, Suffolk marked a turning-point in his life. This time, in 1839, he moved to the parish, and as rector of Hitcham he lived at the rectory. He worked there, endearing himself to all who knew him, until the end of his life. His energies were devoted to the improvement of his parishioners, but his influence was felt far and wide. Botany at Cambridge suffered, attendance at lectures fell, and we have records of complaints made within the university.Memorials, Journal and Correspondence of Charles Cardale Babbington 1897. p297 Henslow did not resign his chair, and continued to give lectures, set and mark exams, and take part in university affairs. Nevertheless, his influence there was naturally much reduced.Walters and Stow 2001, pp. 58, 151-2 Henslow's work in Hitcham, over and above the normal duties of a Rector, can be summarised as follows:Russell-Gebbett J. 1977. Henslow of Hitcham: botanist, educationalist & clergyman. Dalton, Lavenham. :1. The Parish School and other charities. Hitcham was a poor parish, and most people would have been illiterate. Education had to be paid for, and so Henslow both raised funds and donated his own money to support a school. The school was founded in 1841, and Henslow himself gave a series of volunteer classes on Monday afternoons for some of the older children. The botanical curriculum was printed. The botany taught in this school had effects throughout Britain, because important people at the centre, such as Prince Albert and Lyon Playfair kept in touch and rightly regarded Henslow as an authority on the subject. :2. Adult education in the Village. The Hitcham Labourers' and Mechanics' Horticultural Society was the vehicle used by Henslow to 'improve' the labouring and agricultural workers in the village and its surrounds. Competitions, shows and excursions were the attractions, and the intent was practical, to improve agriculture by educating the parishioners. Henslow made use of gifts and facilities provided by his friends. Advances such as made by Justus von Liebig in Germany, who began to apply chemistry to the needs of agriculture, had not yet become widely utilised. :3. Museums. The town of Ipswich is twelve miles from Hitcham. As a result of his Cambridge experiences, Henslow believed in the value of museums as vehicles for education. Ipswich Museum was established in 1847 as a natural history museum and owed much to Henslow, who was elected its President in 1850. Alongside this work he remained an inquiring scientist at heart. In 1843 he discovered nodules of coprolitic origin in the Red Crag at Felixstowe in Suffolk, and two years later he called attention to those also in the Cambridge Greensand and remarked that they might be of use in agriculture. Although Henslow derived no benefit, these discoveries led to the establishment of the phosphate industry in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire; and the works proved lucrative until the introduction of foreign phosphates. Henslow died on 16 May 1861 at Hitcham. == Family == Henslow married Harriet Jenyns (1797–1857), daughter of George Leonard Jenyns and sister of Leonard Jenyns on 16 December 1823. Their eldest daughter Frances Harriet married Joseph Dalton Hooker, and their youngest daughter, Anne, became a botanical artist.Walters and Stow 2001, pp. 19–20. Their sons included George Henslow (1835–1925), who became the Royal Horticultural Society's Professor of Botany and the first President of the Churchmen's Union for the Advancement of Liberal Religious Thought. ==Selected publications== * * Henslow, John Stevens.

Wingham became part of North Huron in 2001 when the Ontario government imposed amalgamation on the former township of East Wawanosh, the village of Blyth, and the town of Wingham. Wingham is located at the intersection of County Roads 4 and 86. Most of Wingham is located between County Road 86 to the south and the Maitland River to the north. ==History== In 1854, the original survey for Wingham was conducted, with 1,000 acres dedicated to the community north of what is now Highway 86 and Highway 4. The town was incorporated in 1879. Wingham's town hall was constructed and opened in 1890. The community's post office was built across the street and opened in 1907. Multiple-unit business buildings were constructed from 1878 to 1892, lining the town's main street. Well-known products created from Wingham businesses included: * Hardwood chairs manufactured by Conestoga Chair Company, which opened in 1898 * Wooden doors, constructed by Lloyd-Truax. Doormaking began in Wingham in 1888 by Charles Lloyd * Milk, processed by Sunrise Dairy, which opened in 1928 The community's hospital, serving Wingham and surrounding areas, dates back to 1906. ==Business and industry== Josephine Street Wingham has a number of manufacturing businesses, and a variety of retail and service businesses. Wingham supports two grocery stores, and a main street with retail stores and restaurants. The town has branches of the Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and TD Canada Trust banks, and a branch of Libro Financial Group credit union. The industries with a presence in the town include: * Wescast Industries, three manufacturing facilities for this auto-part producer. * BI-AX International produces plastic film for use in food packaging and industry. * Royal Homes is a manufacturer of pre-fabricated homes. * Britespan Building Systems Inc. is a manufacturer of fabric covered steel structure buildings. ==Radio and television== Wingham was one of the first towns in Ontario to have a community radio station, with W.T. Cruickshank founding CKNX Broadcasting Ltd in 1926. Wingham has three radio stations: CKNX 920, CKNX-FM 101.7, and Classic Rock 94.5, all owned by Blackburn Radio. There is also a television station CKNX channel 8, owned by CTVglobemedia. It rebroadcasts the master signal of CFPL-TV from London, with the exception of local advertising. CKNX became a rebroadcaster of CFPL London on August 31, 2009. On April 9, 2007, it was announced that Rogers Communications had filed with the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission to purchase all of the A-Channel stations, including CFPL, CKNX, CKX-TV, Access Alberta and several cable channels that were for sale by CHUM Limited in the wake of CTVglobemedia's acquisition of the CHUM group. CTV said it would not renew the licence for CKNX-TV in Wingham upon expiration at the end of August 2009. On May 1, 2009, Shaw Communications offered to buy the station for $1 from CTV (along with other underperforming stations in Brandon and Windsor), but scuttled the deal two months later. CKNX closed down as a separate station on August 31, 2009. Its transmitter remains in operation as an analogue rebroadcaster of CFPL-DT in London. Wingham was also served by a CBC English TV station (Channel 45), which re-transmitted CBLT-TV Toronto via CBLN-TV London. This transmitter, along with CBC/Radio-Canada's other remaining analog transmitters, was shut down permanently on July 31, 2012, leaving over-the-air viewers in the area with no free CBC television service. ==Education== Public education is managed by the Avon Maitland District School Board, which oversees the following schools: * F. E. Madill Secondary School is located in Wingham. Approximately 800 students from grades 7-12 attend; most are bused in from the surrounding area. Madill is known for its Senior Boys' Basketball team and its Track and Field team. * Maitland River Elementary School is located in Wingham beside F.E. Madill Secondary School. Approximately 400-500 students attend from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 6. The former Wingham Public School educated thousands of children on John Street, but was closed in 2013. Catholic education is managed by the Huron-Perth Catholic District School Board. It has one elementary school, Sacred Heart School, located in the town's east end. ==Transportation== Wingham is located to the north of County Road 86 which connects to Kitchener-Waterloo to the east. The main thoroughfare is County Road 4, called Josephine Street within Wingham, which connects to London, Ontario to the south. Wingham/Richard W. LeVan Aerodrome is a general aviation airport to the southeast of Wingham with fuel services and private hangars. Wingham was served by scheduled bus service to London, Owen Sound, and Stratford until 2013, when provider Aboutown entered receivership. ==Attractions== Founding plaque The North Huron Museum provides an overview of the history of the Township of North Huron beginning in the Paleolithic era and continuing into modern times. ==Notable people== *Dave Farrish - NHL hockey player and current assistant coach of the Colorado Avalanche *Honoré Jackson - A leader of the North-West Rebellion *Andrew Kaufman - Writer/film director, raised in Wingham *Bob McDonald - Science journalist; Officer of the Order of Canada, raised in Wingham *Alice Munro - 2013 Nobel Prize laureate for literature, short story author, born in and wrote about Wingham *George Agnew Reid - Artist, raised near Wingham. *Doug Wood - Canadian record holder in pole vault, raised in Wingham ===Politicians=== *William Aberhart - Premier of Alberta, 1935-1943.

As a consequence of these preliminary investigations the scope of the inquiry was broadened into a major inquiry named Operation Antler. The inquiries established that a number of the participants in the Service Volunteer Programme claimed to have been tricked into taking part in experiments. Some also claimed to have suffered long-term illness or injury as a result of the experiments. The investigation covered the period from 1939 to 1989 and has lasted for five years. Its thirteen members interviewed over 700 ex-servicemen or their relatives. The British Government provided the constabulary with an additional 870,000 pounds towards the costs. At least 20,000 servicemen participated as volunteers in testing at Porton Down and records survive from 1942 onwards. The Second World War was the peak period for testing, and much of this concerned mustard gas, with as many as 8,000 volunteers being exposed. After 1945, testing shifted to nerve agents, and used around 3,400 volunteers (although they may not all have been exposed). In the 1960s, smaller scale experiments took place with non-lethal agents such as LSD and glycollates, and more recently testing focused on countermeasures such as pyridostigmine bromide which is a pre-treatment for nerve agents. The constabulary developed 25 cases for possible prosecution, of which eight were forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service. Subsequently, the CPS decided that there would be no prosecutions of scientists involved in the tests. The CPS decision was reviewed following the verdict of unlawful killing at the inquest in November 2004 into the death on 6 May 1953 of volunteer Ronald Maddison. In June 2006, the CPS confirmed that there would be no prosecutions. ==References== == External links == * Wiltshire police Operation Antler information * BBC News report, November 2002: Nerve gas inquest to be re- opened * Porton Down Veteran's Support Group Antler (Porton Down investigation) Category:Toxicology in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom chemical weapons program ","title":"Operation Antler (Porton Down investigation)"},{"id":"530435","text":"A lamb version of balti gosht A balti or bāltī gosht (, ) is a type of lamb meat or goat meat curry served in a thin, pressed-steel wok called a \\"balti bowl\\". The name may have come from the metal dish in which the curry is cooked, rather than from any specific ingredient or cooking technique. Balti curries are cooked quickly using vegetable oil rather than ghee, over high heat in the manner of a stir-fry, and any meat is used off the bone. This combination differs sharply from a traditional one-pot Indian curry which is simmered slowly all day. Balti sauce is based on garlic and onions, with turmeric and garam masala, among other spices. Balti gosht is eaten in Pakistan and North India, as well as other parts of the world, such as Great Britain. The food seems to have arrived in England in Birmingham in 1971; sources suggest it originates from Baltistan in northern Pakistan. ==Origin, history and etymology== Balti, as a food, is named after the steel or iron pot in which it is cooked. The word is found in Hindustani, Odia and Bengali, and means \\"bucket\\".Hobson-Jobson: Being A Glossary of Anglo-Indian Colloquial Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, by Col. Henry Yule and the late Arthur C. Burnell. London: John Murray, 1886, at page 40. The word developed from the Portuguese balde, meaning bucket or pail, and traveled to the Indian subcontinent via the Portuguese seafaring enterprises of the early 16th century. The word likely made its way into the English language during the time of British India. According to Pat Chapman, a food historian, the origins of the word can be traced to the area of Baltistan, in northern Pakistan, where a cast-iron wok, similar to the Chinese wok, is used for cooking. Baltistan shares a border with China. In his Curry Club Balti Curry Cookbook, Chapman states: However, Colleen Taylor Sen states that the origins of balti gosht are unclear, as the food eaten in Baltistan \\"bears no resemblance\\" to balti gosht. As such, the name of the food may have originated from the fact that bāltī gosht is cooked in a pot resembling a baltī, the Hindustani word for bucket. Another claim regarding the origin of balti cooking in Birmingham was that it was first served in 1977 in a restaurant called Adil's. At that time, the restaurant was located in Stoney Lane, Sparkbrook, and after some time relocated to another area, but since has returned to its original place in Stoney Lane. ==Balti houses== Balti gosht in Pakistan Balti chicken with rice and naan from Edinburgh, Scotland Balti restaurants are often known in Birmingham as 'balti houses'. Some balti houses have a plate of glass on the table top with menus secured beneath. Balti houses typically offer large karack naan bread pieces, to be shared by the whole table. Balti houses were originally clustered along and behind the main road between Sparkhill and Moseley, to the south of Birmingham city centre. This area, comprising Ladypool Road, Stoney Lane, and Stratford Road, is still sometimes referred to as the 'Balti Triangle', and contains a high concentration of balti restaurants. On 28 July 2005, a tornado caused extensive damage to buildings in the triangle,birmingham.gov.uk : Birmingham tornado forcing many restaurants to close. Most reopened by the beginning of 2006. Balti restaurants have now spread beyond the triangle, and can also be found in the south of Birmingham, along the Pershore Rd in Stirchley. Lye near Stourbridge to the west of Birmingham has become known as the 'Balti Mile' with up to a dozen restaurants clustered along the High Street. The food and its style of presentation proved very popular during the 1980s, and popularity grew in the 1990s. Balti restaurants gradually opened up throughout the West Midlands, and then a large part of Britain. The expanded curry market in Britain is now said to take in 4 billion pounds sterling per year, but some still claim that it is impossible to get a 'proper' balti outside the urban West Midlands. Outside Britain, a small number of balti houses are in Ireland and many other English- speaking countries, particularly New Zealand and Australia. Since the late 1990s, British supermarkets have stocked a growing range of prepacked balti meals, and the balti restaurant sector has since faced increasing competition from the retail sector and from changes in customer tastes, along with other traditional South Asian and Indian restaurants. ==See also== *Karahi *Chicken tikka masala *Balti wine ==References== ==Further reading== * Curry Club Balti Curry Cookbook, Piatkus, London — & (1993) * Modern Balti Curries, above title republished by John Blake Publishing, London (2006) * Pat Chapman’s Balti Bible, Hodder & Stoughton, London — & (1998) * 2009 Cobra Good Curry Guide, John Blake Publishing, London — ==External links== Category:Baltistan Category:Pakistani cuisine Category:Culture in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:British cuisine Category:Kashmiri cuisine Category:Pakistani cuisine in the United Kingdom ","title":"Balti (food)"},{"id":"530450","text":"The Dissociatives is the sole album by the Australian duo of the same name, released in April 2004 by record label Eleven. It peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Three singles were issued from the album, \\"Somewhere Down the Barrel\\" (March 2004), \\"Young Man, Old Man (You Ain't Better Than the Rest)\\" (May) and \\"Horror with Eyeballs\\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 they won Best Video for \\"Somewhere Down the Barrel\\", directed by James Hackett and Best Cover Art for the album, also by Hackett. == Background == Daniel Johns (of Silverchair) and Australian dance music producer, Paul Mac, met when Mac remixed Silverchair's song \\"Freak\\" off the Freak Show album. The two worked on an experimental extended play, I Can't Believe It's Not Rock, released in 2000. == Recording and production == In mid-2003 Johns and Mac collaborated to record an album, The Dissociatives, starting with basic tracks in London and finishing off in Sydney and Newcastle. The pair provided all the instrumental tracks and vocals themselves with Johns writing the lyrics and recording them in Newcastle. The duo described the music and lyrics in the April 2004 Australian edition of Rolling Stone, \\"The music is, for me, a combination of excitement, happiness, rambunctiousness and vicaciousness, done to whimsy,\\" Johns said. \\"I'd add with a hint of melancholy, but it's more outweighed by joy,\\" added Mac. The magazine's writer described the sound of the debut single, \\"Somewhere Down the Barrel\\", as a \\"happy sort of Radiohead.\\" == Release and reception == The Dissociatives was released on 4 April 2004, by record label, Eleven. It was fitted with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. \\"Somewhere Down the Barrel\\", their first single, entered the ARIA Singles Chart on debut at No. 25 on 15 March 2004. It was one of the five most played tracks on Australian radio in early March of that year. Given that Silverchair sold more albums in Australia in the 1990s than any other Australian artist, the debut album by the Dissociatives was expected to be one of the best selling ones when it was released on 5 April in that country. It debuted and peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. == Reception == The Dissociatives has received a generally positive critical reception. A negative review came from Pitchfork, which wrote, \\"Leftfield techno vet Paul Mac seems stale working away from a club-oriented context, but it's Johns who seems out of his depth. Maybe he can write a three-chord rock song, but here he under- sings, over-emotes, and writes melodies that spiral off in insane directions before ending up nowhere\\". ==Track listing== All music written by Daniel Johns and Paul Mac; all lyrics written by Johns. #\\"We're Much Preferred Customers\\" – 5:46 #\\"Somewhere Down the Barrel\\" – 4:39 #\\"Horror with Eyeballs\\" – 4:45 #\\"Lifting the Veil from the Braille\\" – 4:18 #\\"Forever and a Day\\" – 4:49 #\\"Thinking in Reverse\\" – 3:41 #\\"Paris Circa 2007slash08\\" – 3:52 #\\"Young Man, Old Man (You Ain't Better Than the Rest)\\" – 4:31 #\\"Aaängry Megaphone Man\\" – 4:52 #\\"Sleep Well Tonight\\" – 2:29 #\\"Paris Circa 2007slash08\\" (Hermitude Remix) (Japan bonus track) ==Awards and nominations== ; Award wins * ARIA Music Awards of 2004: Best Video for James Hackett as director of \\"Somewhere Down the Barrel\\" * ARIA Music Awards of 2004: Best Cover Art for James Hackett on The Dissociatives ; Nominations * ARIA Music Awards of 2004: Album of the Year for The Dissociatives * ARIA Music Awards of 2004: Best Group for the Dissociatives * ARIA Music Awards of 2004: Best Pop Release for The Dissociatives * ARIA Music Awards of 2004: Producer of the Year for Daniel Johns and Paul Mac on The Dissociatives ==Release history== The album was released in various countries. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: middle;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Country  Date  Label  Format  Catalog -  Australia  5 April 2004  Eleven  CD  ELEVENCD23 -  United States  29 March 2005  Astralwerks  CD  577944 -  United Kingdom  2 May 2005  Virgin Records  CD  CDVIR217 -  Japan  25 May 2005  Toshiba-EMI  CD  VJCP-68751 } ==References== ==External links== * Category:ARIA Award-winning albums Category:The Dissociatives albums Category:2004 debut albums Category:Astralwerks albums Category:Eleven: A Music Company albums Category:Virgin Records albums ","title":"The Dissociatives (album)"},{"id":"530465","text":"Saint Andrews (2016 population: 1,786) is a town in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, Canada. The historic town is a national historic site of Canada, bearing many characteristics of a typical 18th century British colonial settlement, including the original grid layout with its market square, and the classical architecture. Although often shortened in non-official sources to St. Andrews, the town's legal name is spelt Saint Andrews, and appears as such on the town's website. ==History== At the eastern end the town is a midden, a pile of shells and other refuse that accumulated over two thousand years due to year-round activity of the indigenous peoples in Canada. It is today a provincial heritage site. The site of the town was named Qunnnoskwamk'ook, meaning long gravel bar in the Malecite-Passamaquoddy language. The present name was given by a French missionary who landed at the site on Saint Andrew's Day. The site was settled in 1783 by Penobscot Loyalists. The town's street grid was designed by Charles Morris and was laid out at that time and persists today. Except for the shoreline Water Street, all street names have royal or colonial associations. Also typical of British colonial settlement of the time are the defensive sites, public spaces, and delineation of the town. A blockhouse was built during the War of 1812 and is now a national historic site. Between 1820 and 1860, the port of Saint Andrews welcomed Irish immigrants. They were first quarantined at Hospital Island, in Passamaquoddy Bay. At the 1851 census, more than 50% of the town's population had been born in Ireland.Irish Canadian Cultural Association of New Brunswick The Pendlebury Lighthouse, also known as the St. Andrews North Point Lighthouse, was built in 1833 at the tip of the peninsula. It was deactivated in 1938, and has since been restored and registered as a Canadian historic place. In 1840, the Charlotte County Court House was built, and is still in use. In the late 1800s and early 1900s St Andrews became a seaside resort for people from Montreal and Boston seeking to escape the summer heat. The town's first seaside hotel, the Argyll, opened in 1881David Sullivan, Argyll Hotel, Old New Brunswick, Accessed August 23, 2016 followed in 1889 by The Algonquin, a resort on a hill overlooking the town, making Saint Andrews Canada's first seaside resort. The Argyll burned down in 1892 and was never rebuilt and the Algonquin burned in 1914 but was rebuilt one year later. The lifestyle of wealthy summer visitors is commemorated at the Ross Memorial Museum. A federal marine research facility, the St. Andrews Biological Station, was established in 1908. and the Huntsman Marine Science Centre in 1969. The town was designated a national historic site in 1998. ==Geography== Saint Andrews is at the southern tip of a peninsula, extending into Passamaquoddy Bay. The waterfront faces Saint Andrews Harbour and the Western Channel, which is formed by Navy Island. The harbour is at the mouth of the St. Croix River. The town is directly opposite the community of Robbinston, Maine, 2 kilometres to the west across the river mouth, and 53 km by road. Ministers Island is east of the town and is accessible by road at low tide only. ==Transportation== Despite its proximity to the Canada–United States border, the nearest border crossings are 30 km away at St. Stephen or via a ferry service at Deer Island. The only way into or out of Saint Andrews by land is via Route 127, which runs directly through the town. It meets Route 1 on either end of the town. ==Media== A local community channel, CHCO, serves the Saint Andrews and Charlotte County area.

Specifically it is used following kidney, heart, and liver transplantation. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. It comes as mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil. Common side effects include nausea, infections, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of cancer, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is needed by lymphocytes to make guanosine. Mycophenolic acid was initially discovered by Italian Bartolomeo Gosio in 1893. It was rediscovered in 1945 and 1968. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995 following the discovery of its immunosuppressive properties in the 1990s. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 254th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. ==Medical usesOrgan transplant=== Mycophenolate is used for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in adults and kidney transplantation rejection in children over 2 years; whereas mycophenolate sodium is indicated for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection in adults. Mycophenolate sodium has also been used for the prevention of rejection in liver, heart, or lung transplants in children older than two years. ===Autoimmune disease=== Mycophenolate is increasingly utilized as a steroid sparing treatment in autoimmune diseases and similar immune-mediated disorders including Behçet's disease, pemphigus vulgaris, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, small vessel vasculitides, and psoriasis. It is also used for retroperitoneal fibrosis along with a number of other medications. Specifically it has also be used for psoriasis not treatable by other methods. Its increasing application in treating lupus nephritis has demonstrated more frequent complete response and less frequent complications compared to cyclophosphamide bolus therapy, a regimen with risk of bone marrow suppression, infertility, and malignancy. Further work addressing maintenance therapy demonstrated mycophenolate superior to cyclophosphamide, again in terms of response and side-effects. Walsh proposed that mycophenolate should be considered as a first-line induction therapy for treatment of lupus nephritis in people without kidney dysfunction. ===Comparison to other agents=== Compared with azathioprine it has higher incidence of diarrhea, and no difference in risk of any of the other side effects. Mycophenolic acid is 15 times more expensive than azathioprine. The exact role of mycophenolate vs azathioprine has yet to be conclusively established. ==Adverse effects== Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, leukopenia, or anemia reflect the immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with thrombophlebitis and thrombosis. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, and/or invasive cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. More rarely, pulmonary fibrosis or various neoplasia occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site. Several cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have also been reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert that people are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including shingles, other herpes infections, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 people that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a viral infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal. MMF and EC-MPS appear to be equal in benefits and safety. ===Pregnancy=== Mycophenolic acid is associated with miscarriage and congenital malformations when used during pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to get pregnant. ===Blood tests=== Among the most common effects of this drug is increased blood cholesterol levels. Other changes in blood chemistry such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) can occur.Drugs.com: Mycophenolic acid ==Mechanism of action== Purines (including the nucleotides guanosine and adenosine) can either be synthesized de novo using ribose 5-phosphate or they can be salvaged from free nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid is potent, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme essential to the de novo synthesis of guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) from inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP). IMPDH inhibition particularly affects lymphocytes since they rely almost exclusively on de novo purine synthesis. In contrast, many other cell types use both pathways, and some cells, such as terminally differentiated neurons, depend completely on purine nucleotide salvage. Thus, use of mycophenolic acid leads to a relatively selective inhibition of DNA replication in T cells and B cells. ==Pharmacology== Mycophenolate can be derived from the fungi Penicillium stoloniferum, P. brevicompactum and P. echinulatum. Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised in the liver to the active moiety mycophenolic acid. It reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that controls the rate of synthesis of guanine monophosphate in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis used in the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Other cells recover purines via a separate salvage pathway and are thus able to escape the effect. Mycophenolate is potent and can, in many contexts, be used in place of the older anti-proliferative azathioprine. It is usually used as part of a three-compound regimen of immunosuppressants, also including a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone or prednisone).W. Zhang, C. Ding, S. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium: an update Int J Clin Pract, April 2014, 68 (Suppl. 181), 1–3 ==Chemistry== Mycophenolate mofetil, a prodrug form of mycophenolic acid used in medicine Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholino ethyl ester of mycophenolic acid; the ester masks the carboxyl group. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to have a pKa values of 5.6 for the morpholino moiety and 8.5 for the phenolic group. ==History== Mycophenolic acid was discovered by Italian medical scientist Bartolomeo Gosio. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it Penicillium glaucum. (The species is now called P. brevicompactum.) In 1893 he found that the fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he isolated crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the anthrax bacterium. This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and gave the name mycophenolic acid. The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil by Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium by Novartis). Cellcept was developed by a South African geneticist Anthony Allison and his wife Elsie M. Eugui. In the 1970s while working at the Medical Research Council, Allison investigated the biochemical causes of immunune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for undesirable immune response in autoimmune diseases, as well as for immune rejection in organ transplantation. He conceived an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug that could be used for autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge on drug research. However, Syntex liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife. He became vice president for the research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects. They discovered that the compound had immunosuppressive activity. They synthesised a chemical variant for increased activity and reduced adverse effects. They subsequently demonstrated that it was useful in organ transplantation in experimental rats. After successful clinical trials, the compound was approved for use in kidney transplant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 3 May 1995, and was sold under the brand name CellCept. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 1996. ==Names== It was initially introduced as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, trade name CellCept) to improve oral bioavailability. The salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an alternative MPA formulation. MMF and EC-MPS appear to be equal in benefits and safety. ==Research== Mycophenolate mofetil is beginning to be used in the management of auto-immune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (systemic sclerosis or SSc), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with success for some patients. It is also currently being used as a long-term therapy for maintaining remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, though thus far, studies have found it inferior to azathioprine. A combination of mycophenolate and ribavirin has been found to stop infection by and replication of dengue virus in vitro. It has also shown promising antiviral activity against MERS, especially in combination with interferon. Preliminary data suggests that mycophenolate mofetil might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects as an add‐on therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. ==References* Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Genentech brands Category:Hoffmann-La Roche brands Category:Immunosuppressants Category:Italian inventions Category:Morpholines Category:Novartis brands Category:Phenol ethers Category:Phenols Category:Phthalides Category:South African inventions Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate hu:Mikofenolát-mofetil ","title":"Mycophenolic acid"},{"id":"530476","text":"Florence Onyebuchi \\"Buchi\\" Emecheta (21 July 1944 – 25 January 2017) was a Nigerian-born novelist, based in the UK from 1962,Busby, Margaret, \\"Buchi Emecheta obituary\\", The Guardian, 3 February 2017. who also wrote plays and an autobiography, as well as works for children. She was the author of more than 20 books, including Second Class Citizen (1974), The Bride Price (1976), The Slave Girl (1977) and The Joys of Motherhood (1979). Most of her early novels were published by the London-based company Allison and Busby, where her editor was Margaret Busby. Emecheta's themes of child slavery, motherhood, female independence and freedom through education gained recognition from critics and honours. She once described her stories as \\"stories of the world…[where]… women face the universal problems of poverty and oppression, and the longer they stay, no matter where they have come from originally, the more the problems become identical.\\" Her works explore the tension between tradition and modernity. She has been characterized as \\"the first successful black woman novelist living in Britain after 1948\\".Dawson, Ashley, \\"Beyond Imperial Feminism: Buchi Emecheta's London Novels and Black British Women's Emancipation\\", in Mongrel Nation: Diasporic Culture and the Making of Postcolonial Britain, University of Michigan Press, 2007, p. 117. ==Early life and education== Emecheta was born on 21 July 1944, in Lagos, Nigeria, to Igbo parents, Alice (Okwuekwuhe) Emecheta and Jeremy Nwabudinke. Her father was a railway worker and moulder. Due to the gender bias of the time, the young Buchi Emecheta was initially kept at home while her younger brother was sent to school; but after persuading her parents to consider the benefits of her education, she spent her early childhood at an all-girl's missionary school. When she was nine years old her father died (\\"of complications brought on by a wound contracted in the swamps of Burma, where he had been conscripted to fight for Lord Louis Mountbatten and the remnants of the British Empire\\").Onwordi, Sylvester, \\"Remembering my mother Buchi Emecheta, 1944–2017\\", New Statesman, 31 January 2017. A year later, Emecheta received a full scholarship to Methodist Girls' School in Yaba, Lagos, where she remained until the age of 16 when, in 1960, she married Sylvester Onwordi, a schoolboy to whom she had been engaged since she was 11 years old. Later that year, she gave birth to a daughter, and in 1961 their younger son was born. Onwordi immediately moved to London to attend a university, and Emecheta joined him there with their first two children in 1962. She gave birth to five children in six years, three daughters and two sons Her marriage was unhappy and sometimes violent, as chronicled in her autobiographical writings such as 1974's Second-Class Citizen.\\"Emecheta, Buchi\\", Biography, Postcolonial Studies @ Emory. To keep her sanity, Emecheta wrote in her spare time. However, her husband was deeply suspicious of her writing, and he ultimately burned her first manuscript, as revealed in The Bride Price, eventually published in 1976. That was her first book, but she had to rewrite it after the first version had been destroyed. She later said \\"There were five years between the two versions.\\"Jussawalla, Feroza F., Reed Way Dasenbrock, \\"Buchi Emecheta\\", Interviews with Writers of the Post-colonial World, University Press of Mississippi, 1992, p. 84.

While working to support her children alone, she earned a B.Sc (Hons) degree in Sociology in 1972 from the University of London. In her 1984 autobiography, Head Above Water she wrote: \\"As for my survival for the past twenty years in England, from when I was a little over twenty, dragging four cold and dripping babies with me and pregnant with a fifth one—that is a miracle.\\"Emecheta, Buchi, Head Above Water, p. 5, quoted in Stephen Jantuah Boakye, \\"Suspense Strategies in Buchi Emecheta’s Head Above Water\\", Language in India, Vol. 13:4, April 2013. ISSN 1930-2940. She went on later to gain her PhD from the university in 1991. ==Career== Emecheta began writing about her experiences of Black British life in a regular column in the New Statesman, and a collection of these pieces became her first published book in 1972, In the Ditch. The semi-autobiographical novel chronicled the struggles of a main character named Adah, who is forced to live in a housing estate while working as a librarian to support her five children. Her second novel published two years later, Second-Class Citizen (Allison and Busby, 1974), also drew on Emecheta's own experiences, and both books were eventually published in one volume by Allison and Busby under the title Adah's Story (1983). These three stories introduced Emecheta's three major themes which were the quest for equal treatment, self confidence and dignity as a woman. Her works Gwendolen (1989) also published as family, Kehinde (1994) and The New Tribe (2000) differ in some way as they address the issues of immigrants life in Great Britain. From 1965 to 1969, Emecheta worked as a library officer for the British Museum in London. From 1969 to 1976, she was a youth worker and sociologist for the Inner London Education Authority,Busby, Margaret, \\"Buchi Emecheta\\", Daughters of Africa, London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, p. 656. and from 1976 to 1978 she worked as a community worker in Camden, North London, meanwhile continuing to produce further novels with Allison and Busby – The Bride Price (1976), The Slave Girl (1977), The Joys of Motherhood (1979) and Destination Biafra (1982) – as well as the children's books Titch the Cat (1979) and Nowhere To Play (1980). Following her success as an author, Emecheta travelled widely as a visiting professor and lecturer. She visited several American universities, including Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. From 1980 to 1981, she was senior resident fellow and visiting professor of English at the University of Calabar, Nigeria. From 1982 to 1983, Emecheta, together with her son Sylvester, ran the Ogwugwu Afor Publishing Company, publishing her own work under the imprint, beginning with Double Yoke (1982).Fraser, C. Gerald, \\"Writer, Her Dream Fulfilled, Seeks to Link Two Worlds\\", The New York Times, 2 June 1990. She received an Arts Council of Great Britain bursary, 1982–83, and was one of Granta′s \\"Best of the Young British Novelists\\" in 1983. In 1982, she lectured at Yale University, and the University of London. She became a Fellow at the University of London in 1986. Over the years, Emecheta worked with many cultural and literary organizations, including the Africa Centre, London, and with the Caine Prize for African Writing as a member of the Advisory Council.The Council of the Caine Prize for African Writing, \\"Tribute to Buchi Emecheta (1944–2017)\\", Caine Prize blog, 1 February 2017.

Random House) The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue (1947; first UK edition, 1948) is a long poem in six parts by W. H. Auden, written mostly in a modern version of Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse. The poem deals, in eclogue form, with man's quest to find substance and identity in a shifting and increasingly industrialized world. Set in a wartime bar in New York City, Auden uses four characters – Quant, Malin, Rosetta, and Emble – to explore and develop his themes. The poem won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1948. It inspired a symphony by composer Leonard Bernstein, The Age of Anxiety (Symphony No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra), which in turn was used for both a 1950 ballet by Jerome Robbins and a 2014 ballet by Liam Scarlett. A critical edition of the poem, edited by Alan Jacobs, was published by Princeton University Press in 2011. \\"The Age of Anxiety\\" is also the title of the first chapter of The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts (1951).

(2008). \\"Nestle in the Ottoman Empire: Global Marketing with Local Flavor 1870–1927\\". Enterprise and Society\\", 9:4. pp 724–761 doi:10.1093/es/khn045 He was the eleventh of fourteen children of Johann Ulrich Matthias Nestle and Anna Maria Catharina Ehemann. Nestle's father, by tradition, inherited the business of his father, Johann Ulrich Nestle, and became a glazier in Töngesgasse. The later Lord Mayor of Frankfurt am Main, Gustav Edmund Nestle, was his brother. The Nestle family has its roots in western Swabia, predominantly in boroughs of the Black Forest such as Dornstetten, Freudenstadt, Mindersbach, Nagold, and Sulz am Neckar. In the Swabian dialect, \\"Nestle\\" is a small bird's nest. The name Nestle also has different variations, including Nästlin, Nästlen, Nestlin, Nestlen, and Niestle. The Nestle family tree began with three brothers (thus the three young birds in the nest being fed by their mother on the family coat of arms) from Mindersbach, called Hans, Heinrich, and Samuel Nestlin. The father of these three sons was born circa 1495. Hans, the eldest, was born in 1520 and had a son with the same name, who later became mayor of Nagold. His son Ulrich was a barber and his fifth son was the first glazier in the family. For over five generations, this profession was passed down from father to son. Additionally, the Nestles provided a number of mayors for the boroughs of Dornstetten, Freudenstadt, Nagold, and Sulz am Neckar. == Career == Before Nestlé turned 20 in 1834, he completed a four-year apprenticeship with J. E. Stein, owner of a Frankfurt pharmacy. At some stage between 1834 and 1839 he migrated, for reasons unknown, to Switzerland.\\"Henri Nestlé 1814 –1890\\", Bicentenary. Page 25, From Pharmacist’s Assistant to Founder of the World’s Leading Nutrition, Health and Wellness Company, Nestlé – Abridged Translation after Albert Pfiffner's 1993 German Edition, 2014 At the end of 1839, he was officially authorized in Lausanne, Switzerland, to perform chemical experiments, make up prescriptions, and sell medicines. During this time, he changed his name to Henri Nestlé in order to adapt better to the new social conditions in French-speaking Vevey, Switzerland, where he eventually settled. In 1843, Nestlé bought into one of the region's production of rapeseeds. He also became involved in the production of nut oils (used to fuel oil lamps), liqueurs, rum, absinthe, and vinegar. He also began manufacturing and selling carbonated mineral water and lemonade, although during the European food crisis in the 1840s, Nestlé gave up mineral water production. In 1857 he began concentrating on gas lighting and fertilizers. Though it is not known when Nestlé started working on his infant formula project, by 1867, Nestlé had produced a viable powdered milk product.Cadbury, Deborah. (2010). Chocolate Wars: From Cadbury to Kraft: 200 years of Sweet Success and Bitter Rivalry, HarperCollins UK, . His interest is known to have been spurred by several factors. Although Nestlé and his wife were childless, they were aware of the high death rate among infants. Nestlé would have been aware of Justus von Liebig's work in developing an infant formula. In addition, fresh milk was not always available in large towns, and women in higher society were starting to view breastfeeding as an \\"unfashionable\\" option. Nestlé combined cow’s milk with grain and sugar to produce a substitute for breast milk. Moreover, he and his friend Jean Balthasar Schnetzler, a scientist in human nutrition, removed the acid and the starch in wheat flour because they were difficult for babies to digest. Initially called \\"kindermehl,\\" or \\"children flour,\\" his product had an advantage over Liebig's \\"soup for infants\\" in that it was much easier to prepare, needing only to be boiled prior to feeding, and it soon proved to be a viable option for infants who were unable to breastfeed. People quickly recognized the value of the new product, and soon Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé, \\"Henri Nestlé's Milk Flour\\" in French, was being sold in much of Europe. By the 1870s, Nestlé's Infant Food, made with malt, cow's milk, sugar, and wheat flour, was selling in the US for $0.50 a bottle. Nestlé's milk-condensation process enabled the chocolatier Daniel Peter, of Vevey, to perfect his milk chocolate formulation in 1875, after seven years of effort, and the two men subsequently formed a partnership which resulted, four years later, in 1879, in the organisation of the Nestlé Company, which eventually became one of the largest Europe-based confection industries. == Personal life == Nestlé and Anna Clémentine Thérèse Ehemant were married in Frankfurt, Germany on 23 May 1860. Nestlé sold his company in 1875 to his business associates and then lived with his family alternately in Montreux and Glion, where they helped people with small loans and publicly contributed towards improving the local infrastructure. In Glion he moved into a house later known as Villa Nestlé. Nestlé died of a heart attack in Glion on July 7, 1890. He was buried at Territet Cemetery in Montreux.Henri Nestlé-Ehmant (1814–1890) at Find A Grave Memorial == References == == Sources == * Kaufmann, Jens Th.: Familie Nestle aus Nagold und Mindersbach.

(March 13, 1907 – May 6, 1995), also known by her literary pseudonym Hilda de Toledano, was a Portuguese writer and journalist who claimed to be the bastard daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal. From 1932 she also claimed the right to the title of Duchess of Braganza and to be the rightful heiress to the throne of Portugal.Jean Pailler; Maria Pia of Braganza: The Pretender. New York: ProjectedLetters, 2006. Maria Pia of Braganza claimed that King Carlos I legitimized her through a royal decree and placed her in the line of succession, however no proof was presented to demonstrate this and the King similarly did not have the personal authority to do so. Maria Pia's paternity was never proven and her claim to the throne or of royal ancestry never widely accepted. ==Birth and baptism== Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança was born in Lisbon, Portugal, to Maria Amélia Laredó e Murça, the daughter of a wealthy Brazilian couple who had moved to Europe: Armando Maurício Laredó and Maria Amélia Murça e Berhen. Maria Amélia's parents are sometimes given the title \\"baron\\", but they did not actually hold any noble title; their wealth, however, may have allowed them to use such a title unquestioned. Avenida da Liberdade, in Lisbon, where Maria Pia of Braganza was born. Maria Amélia Laredó e Murça was not married at the time she gave birth to her daughter on March 13, 1907. Maria Pia of Braganza claimed that, shortly thereafter, she was taken by her mother and grandparents to Madrid, Spain. There, she said, she was baptised in the Church of Saint Fermin de los Navarros on April 15, 1907 and that the baptism was registered at the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and Saint Aloysius. She claimed that her baptismal registration recorded that her father was \\"D. Carlos de Sassonia-Coburgo y Savoya de la Casa de Braganza de Portugal\\". This clearly refers to King Carlos I of Portugal, who at the time was married to another woman, Princess Amélie of Orléans. It has been suggested that Maria Pia of Braganza was, in fact, one Hilda de Toledano, a girl of modest birth adopted by a Brazilian family. The original baptismal registers of the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and Saint Aloysius were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War, and no original birth record of Maria Pia of Braganza has ever been made public. In 1939 the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalas issued a baptismal certificate to Maria Pia of Braganza with information provided to him at that time by Don Antonio Goicoechea y Cusculluela, a member of the Spanish parliament and the Governor of the Bank of Spain, who had reportedly been present at the baptism. Subsequently Maria Pia of Braganza used this baptismal certificate as evidence for her claim to be the recognised daughter of King Carlos. The Church of Saint Fermin de los Navarros, in Madrid, where Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança was baptized. Maria Pia of Braganza also claimed that in the archives of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalá there was a copy of a document signed by King Carlos March 14, 1907 in which he recognised Maria Pia of Braganza as his daughter and that \\"she may be called by my name and enjoy from now on the use of this name with the honours, prerogatives, rank, obligations and advantages of the princes of the House of Braganza of Portugal\\". Like the baptismal certificate, the original of this document did not survive. ==Marriages and children== Maria Pia of Braganza In 1925 at the age of eighteen Maria Pia of Braganza married Francesco Javier Bilbao y Batista, a Cuban playboy twenty years her senior. He came from a rich family of cattle breeders. Since Bilbao was divorced, the marriage was a civil one only and took place in the Cuban embassy in Paris. They had one daughter, Fátima Francisca Xaviera Iris Bilbao de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança,Jean Pailler; Maria Pia of Braganza: The Pretender. New York: ProjectedLetters, 2006. in 1932, who became a cloistered nun in a convent. Maria Pia of Braganza lived briefly with Bilbao in Cuba, before returning to Spain. Bilbao died November 15, 1935. Francisca died unmarried in 1982. To escape the Spanish Civil War, Maria Pia of Braganza moved with her mother to Rome. In 1939 she married Giuseppe Manlio Blais, a general in the Italian carabinieri. At the time, members of the carabinieri were forbidden from marrying foreigners. The marriage was, therefore, celebrated clandestinely, and was not registered civilly until August 5, 1946. The union proved much happier and together they had a daughter, Maria da Glória Cristina Amélia Valéria Antónia Blais de Saxe- Coburgo e Bragança, born in 1946. Maria Cristina Blais de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança (or also called Maria Cristina of Braganza) married the Spanish sculptor Miguel Ortíz y Berrocal (1933–2006) and together they lived in Verona and had two sons: Carlos Miguel Berrocal de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança (born 1976) and Beltrão José Berrocal de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança (born 1978). General Blais died in 1983. In 1985, Maria Pia of Braganza married António João da Costa Amado-Noivo (January 28, 1952 – December 29, 1996). At the time of the wedding, Maria Pia was 78, Amado-Noivo 33. ==Literary career== Maria Pia of Braganza Like many society ladies, Maria Pia of Braganza supplemented her income by writing. In the early 1930s she had a number of articles published in two Spanish newspapers Blanco y Negro and ABC. In 1937, Maria Pia wrote her first book La hora de Alfonso XIII (The Hour of Alfonso XIII) published in Havana, Cuba, by Ucar, Garcia y Companía. This work, written in Spanish and published under the name \\"Hilda de Toledano\\", is a defence of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who was living in exile at the time. In 1954, Maria Pia wrote Un beso y ... nada más: confidencia consciente de una pecadora inconsciente (A Kiss and ... Nothing More: Conscious Confidences of an Unconscious Sinner) published in Madrid by Plenitud. This novel was also written in Spanish and published under the name \\"Hilda de Toledano\\". In 1957, Maria Pia wrote Mémoires d'une infante vivante (Memoirs of a Living Infanta) published in Paris by Del Duca. This work, written in French and published under the name \\"Maria Pia de Saxe-Cobourg Bragance\\", is an autobiography. It marks the first attempt of Maria Pia to receive widespread public recognition for her claim that she was the bastard daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal. In the book, however, Maria Pia makes no claim to any dynastic rights. The book closes with the sentence, \\"I claim no sceptre but my pen, no crown but that bequeathed by my father and mother: my dignity.\\" Instead, Maria Pia of Braganza suggests that the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne should be Princess Isabelle d’Orléans, eldest child of Henri, Count of Paris. ==ControversiesClaim to the Portuguese throne=== Maria Pia de Saxe- Coburgo e Bragança in a public speech to the Portuguese people. For at least several decades Maria Pia had claimed to be the bastard daughter of King Carlos I, and even to be entitled to the style \\"Her Royal Highness\\" and the title \\"Infanta\\". It was not, however, until 1957 that she claimed to be the rightful queen of Portugal in succession to Manuel II, the son of Carlos I (and the purported half-brother of Maria Pia) who had died childless in 1932. On July 15, 1957 a group of ten Portuguese monarchists published a petition asking Maria Pia to claim the throne. In 1958 she went to Portugal where she was received by the President Francisco Craveiro Lopes; the Prime Minister, António de Oliveira Salazar, however, refused to meet her. In the presidential elections that year Maria Pia supported the failed candidacy of Humberto Delgado. She continued to support Delgado after he went into exile in Brazil. From this point forward Maria Pia used the title \\"Duchess of Braganza\\". She attracted the support of a small minority of monarchists who were actively opposed to Salazar. Maria Pia of Braganza played on the rivalry in monarchist circles between the Miguelists and the constitutionalists, presenting herself as the \\"constitutional\\" (i.e. liberal) candidate. The support given to Salazar by Miguel's heir at the time, Duarte Nuno, in the 1950s enabled Maria Pia of Braganza even more to represent herself as the liberal and democratic claimant to the Portuguese throne. Cover of a vinyl record with speeches from Maria Pia as \\"the Duchess of Braganza\\". Maria Pia was very active in her claim to the Portuguese throne. Articles about her appeared in Italian and Portuguese newspapers. In February 1965, she went to Portugal to visit the tomb of King Carlos. As she was leaving Portugal and returning to Spain, she was arrested and held in custody overnight. She was released without charge at the request of the Italian embassy. In 1976, she infamously checked out of a hotel in Lisbon, where she had stayed for several weeks, without paying the bill, claiming simply that as the Duchess of Braganza she was not obligated to pay for her lodging. Maria Pia mixed frequently with the jet set idle rich. She claimed that for many years she maintained an ongoing friendship with the exiled King Alfonso XIII of Spain and his son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, and this was confirmed by the first wife of the latter, Emanuela de Dampierre. Much correspondence exists between Maria Pia de Bragança and members of European royal families recording her efforts to gain legitimacy within royal circles, but most of the replies were merely polite but unsupportive. ===Baptismal certificate=== Maria Pia In October 1966 Duarte Nuno petitioned an ecclesiastical court of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcala to remove the name of King Carlos from the baptismal certificate of Maria Pia. Duarte Nuno claimed that there was no evidence that King Carlos was the father of Maria Pia. It is unusual for a baptismal registration to record the father of a bastard child. The Roman Ritual instructs the officiating priest only to record the father's name if the father himself requests it or if he is known to be the father from some public authentic document (Titulus XII, caput II). Clearly King Carlos was not present at Maria Pia's baptism, but Maria Pia claimed that the copy of the document purportedly signed by Carlos granting her the rights of the princes of Portugal was sufficient justification in ecclesiastical law for Carlos to be named her father on her baptismal certificate. In February 1972 the case between Duarte Nuno and Maria Pia moved up to the Sacred Roman Rota, the normal appeal court for the Roman Catholic Church. On December 6, 1972 the court dismissed the claim, on the grounds that Duarte Nuno did not have legal standing in the case, being only the second cousin twice removed of King Carlos. The court did not address the primary question of whether there was sufficient evidence for Carlos being Maria Pia's father and thus named as such on the baptismal certificate. It did, however, question the necessity of changing a certificate which was over sixty years old. Had the Roman Rota found in favour of Duarte Nuno, his supporters could have said that the court had determined that Carlos was not Maria Pia's father. Since the court found against Duarte Nuno, the supporters of Maria Pia of Braganza were able to say that the court had affirmed the validity of her baptismal certificate and therefore the validity of her claimed parentage – neither of which in fact actually occurred. The court found only that Duarte Nuno did not have the legal standing to bring such a case: \\"Patres Auditores de Turno ... decreverunt negative, seu non constare de legitimatione actoris ad causam\\". ===Legal battle over property=== In 1982 Maria Pia filed a claim for the restitution of the private real property of the Royal House of Portugal. It was rejected by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice at Lisbon on April 14, 1983. The Court found that Maria Pia had not established the identity of her father, despite the presentation of the same baptismal certificate presented to the court at the Vatican. ===Rosario Poidimani=== Rosario Poidimani Rosario Poidimani (born Syracuse, August 25, 1941) is an Italian businessman. On December 2, 1985, Maria Pia signed a document purporting to amend the Portuguese Monarchic Constitution of 1838, and recognising Rosario Poidimani as her eventual heir. On February 19, 1986 she signed a second document affirming that there was a blood relationship between her and Rosario Poidimani – but not stating exactly what this relationship was. The Constitution of 1838, which excluded Miguel I of Portugal and his descendants, the present line of the Portuguese Royal family, was revoked in 1842, where the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was reinstated until the Republic, in October 5, 1910. On April 3, 1987, Maria Pia signed a document abdicating her \\"claim\\" to the Portuguese throne and transferring her claimed rights to Rosario Poidimani. In the abdication document she stated that the reason for her action in favour of Rosario Poidimani was that she has been \\"totally deprived of the support of my descent\\". Since 1987, Rosario Poidimani has styled himself \\"H.R.H. Dom Rosario of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Braganza, 22nd Duke of Braganza\\", and has been active in promoting his claims. In December 2003, Rosario Poidimani brought a libel suit in Italy against Guy Stair Sainty in response to Sainty's analysis of the claims of Maria Pia and Rosario Poidimani, A brief response to statements made by the supporters of the late Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, her grandson Carlos Miguel Berrocal y Blais, and her alleged cognate Rosario Poidimani in respect of their claims to the throne of Portugal.A brief response to statements made by the supporters of the late Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, her grandson Carlos Miguel Berrocal y Blais, and her alleged cognate Rosario Poidimani in respect of their claims to the throne of Portugal In August 2010 Rosario Poidimani won a decision against Sainty in the court of Vicenza; for defamation allegedly caused by the article; Sainty was ordered to pay twenty thousand euro in the judgment. The case was won by Stair Sainty under appeal by the Italian Court of Appeal of Venice, no. 730/2016 published March 30, 2016, RG n. 2667/2010, Repert. n. 680/2016 del March 30, 2016. . In 2007 Poidimani was arrested on the charge of fraud in connection with the alleged sale of diplomatic passports; Poidimani claimed that he had the right to issue these passports as head of the Royal House of Portugal and president of the IIRD . The Court of Busto Arsizio initially sentenced him to 5 years in prison in January 2011;Il Giornale di Vicenza.it – Home – Cronaca However, on April 15, 2013, the Court of Appeal of Milan overturned the conviction and sentence. Rosario Poidimani has also initiated a number of complaints and lawsuits against Duarte Pio and against numerous Portuguese government officials. ==Death== Maria Pia of Braganza died in Verona in 1995. She was buried with her second husband General Blais in the Cimitero Monumentale of Verona. ==Analysis== Maria Pia's claims, and those of Rosario Poidimani, have hinged upon the truth or falsehood of the following: # that she was the natural daughter of King Carlos I; # that Carlos I had the constitutional power and the political clout (at a time shortly before his death and the overthrow of his son) to alter the line of succession to the Portuguese throne; # that Carlos I both recognized Maria Pia of Braganza as his daughter and declared her a legitimate heir, despite her birth from an adulterine union; # that Carlos I was able to do the above without causing public scandal or friction within the royal house, particularly in relation to Amelie of Orleans, his wife and their two sons; # that Maria Pia of Braganza, supposedly heir-princess, could then marry foreigners and/or commoners (which she did twice), in apparent violation of the Constitution and/or the house laws of the Portuguese royal house; # that her daughter Maria Cristina of Braganza , and Maria Cristina's sons, all waived their rights of succession;Maria Pia's older daughter Fátima Francisca had already died in a convent without issue before Maria Pia of Braganza attempted to alter the succession; # that she adopted Rosario Poidimani according to Italian laws comparable to those of Portugal; and that this adoption did not violate the house laws and/or Constitution; and # that she could alter the succession line in favour of Rosario Poidimani, a foreigner and adopted son unrelated to her by blood. There are no original documents to support Maria Pia's claims to be both a daughter of Carlos I and an heir to the Dukedom of Braganza and pretense to the throne of Portugal. Maria Pia's baptismal certificate from 1907 was destroyed and there is only a copy of the document in which Carlos I supposedly granted succession rights to Maria Pia. Nonetheless, there exist some records concerning a relationship between Maria Pia's mother Maria Amelia Laredó e Murça and King Carlos I. A biography of Infanta Eulalia of Spain purports to reveal some letters of the Portuguese King and also reveals the existence of Maria Pia of Braganza as King Carlos I's bastard daughter.Zavala, José María; La Infanta Republicana: Eulalia de Borbón, la oveja negra de la Dinastía. Madrid, Plaza & Janés: 2008. King Alfonso XIII of Spain and his son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia seem to have had an ongoing friendship with Maria Pia; her supporters have interpreted this relationship as an affirmation on the part of Alfonso and Jaime de Borbón that they recognised Maria Pia de Bragança as Carlos's bastard daughter. In fact, most of the letters cited by Maria Pia in support of her claim were simply courteous replies by royals to her numerous queries and salutations. Traditionally, the only way in which a bastard child of a Portuguese monarch could have been made legitimate and take his or her place in the line of succession was if his or her parents subsequently were married. At the time of Maria Pia's birth, Carlos was married to Queen Amelie and had two sons with her. Children born of adultery were specifically excluded from the line of succession. Carlos I was a constitutional monarch. He did not claim autocratic power, but instead ruled according to the Constitutional Charter of 1826 which stated that the succession to the throne passed only to legitimate descendants. The Constitution, including all matters of succession, could only be amended by the Cortes. Even if Carlos had signed a document granting succession rights to Maria Pia, it would have had no legal value at all. Just as Carlos could not unilaterally change the Constitutional Charter and grant Maria Pia succession rights, neither could Maria Pia (even if she were rightful queen of Portugal) unilaterally change the Constitution and grant succession rights to Rosario Poidimani above her daughter and grandsons. Under scrutiny, the claims of Maria Pia of Braganza (or Hilda de Toledano) are similar to those of several Europeans born outside marriage who entertain the idea, or fantasy, of descent from royalty; the late Enrico Vigo, who claimed the Byzantine Crown, is another example. ==Further reading== * Maria Pia de Saxe-Cobourg Bragance; Mémoires d'une infante vivante.

It was a development and refinement of the LaGG-3, replacing the earlier model's inline engine with the much more powerful Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine. During its time in service, it was one of the Soviet Air Force's most capable types of warplane, able to fight German designs on an equal footing. ==Development== Lavochkin La-5 replica of Capt Georgii Dmitrievich Kostylev's La-5 of the 4th GIAP, White 15 that served in Leningrad 1943, at the Museum of the Great Patriotic War in Moscow, 2005. The La-5's heritage began even before the outbreak of war, with the LaGG-1, a promising yet under-powered aircraft. The LaGG-3 was a modification of that design that attempted to correct this by both lightening the airframe and fitting a more powerful engine. Nevertheless, this was not enough, and the lack of power remained a significant problem. In early 1942 the LaGG-1 and -3's designer Vladimir Gorbunov attempted to correct this deficiency by experimentally fitting a LaGG-3 with the more powerful Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine. Since the LaGG-3 was powered by an inline engine, they accomplished this by grafting on the nose section of a Sukhoi Su-2 (which used this engine). By now, the shortcomings of the LaGG-3 had caused Lavochkin to fall out of Joseph Stalin's favour, and factories previously assigned to LaGG-3 construction had been turned over to building the rival Yakovlev Yak-1 and Yak-7. The design work, which required that the LaGG-3 be adapted to its new engine and still maintain the aircraft's balance, was undertaken by Lavochkin in a small hut beside an airfield over the winter of 1941–1942, on a completely unofficial basis. When the prototype took flight in March, the result was surprisingly pleasing – the fighter finally had a powerplant that allowed it to perform as well in the air as it had been supposed to on paper. After flying, the LaG-5 (the change in name reflecting that one of the original LaGG designers, Mikhail I. Gudkov, was no longer with the programme), Air Force test pilots declared it superior to the Yak-7, and intensive flight tests began in April. By July, Stalin ordered maximum-rate production of the aircraft and the conversion of any incomplete LaGG-3 airframes to the new configuration, now simply known as the La-5 (despite Vladimir P. Gorbunov still being with the programme). The prototype was put in mass production almost immediately in factories located in Moscow and in the Yaroslav region. Design changes for main production La-5 models included slats to improve all-round performance. While still inferior to the best German fighters at higher altitudes, the La-5 proved to be every bit their match closer to the ground. With most of the air combat over the Eastern Front taking place at altitudes of under 5,000 m (16,404 ft), the La-5 was very much in its element. Further refinement of the aircraft involved cutting down the rear fuselage to give the pilot better visibility, making this version the La-5F. Later, a fuel-injected engine, a different engine air intake and further lightening of the aircraft led to the designation La-5FN that would become the definitive version of the aircraft. A full circle turn took 18–19 seconds. Altogether, 9,920 La-5s of all variants were built, including a number of dedicated trainer versions, designated La-5UTI. Very late La-5FN production models had two 20mm Berezin B-20 cannon installed in the cowling in place of the heavier two 20mm ShVAK (both were capable of a salvo weight of 3.4 kg/s). Further improvements of the aircraft would lead to the Lavochkin La-7. A number of La-5s continued in the service of Eastern Bloc nations after the end of the war, including Czechoslovakia. === Flying the La-5 === In the summer of 1943, a brand-new La-5 made a forced landing on a German airfield, providing the Luftwaffe with an opportunity to test-fly the newest Soviet fighter. Test pilot Hans-Werner Lerche wrote a detailed report of his experience.Котлобовский, А. (Kotlobovskiy, A.) and В. Блащук, (V. Blaschuk) \\"Ла-5ФH с точки зрения люфтваффе (La-5FN from the viewpoint of Luftwaffe).\\" АэроХобби (AeroHobby), Issue 1, 1993. He particularly noted that the La-5FN excelled at altitudes below 3,000 m (9,843 ft) but suffered from short range and flight time of only 40 minutes at cruise engine power. All of the engine controls (throttle, mixture, propeller pitch, radiator and cowl flaps, and supercharger gearbox) had separate levers which forced the pilot to make constant adjustments during combat or risk suboptimal performance. For example, rapid acceleration required moving no less than six levers. In contrast, contemporary German aircraft with the BMW 801 used the Kommandogerät engine computer system that automatically controlled all of these settings from a single throttle lever. Due to airflow limitations, the engine boost system (Forsazh) could not be used above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). Stability in all axes was generally good. The authority of the ailerons was deemed exceptional but the rudder was insufficiently powerful at lower speeds. At speeds in excess of 600 km/h (370 mph), the forces on control surfaces became excessive. Horizontal turn time at 1,000 m (3,281 ft) and maximum engine power was 25 seconds. The La-5 was found to have a top speed and acceleration at low altitude that were comparable to Luftwaffe fighters. The La-5FN possessed a slightly higher roll rate than the Bf-109. However, the Bf-109 was slightly faster and had the advantage of a higher rate of climb and better turn rate.Luftwaffe Test Pilot by Hans Werner Lerche, Page 158 The La-5FN had a slightly better climb rate and smaller turn radius than the Fw 190A-8. However, the Fw 190A-8 was faster at all altitudes and had significantly better dive performance and a superior roll-rate. As a result, Lerche's recommendations for Fw 190 pilots were to attempt to draw the La-5FN to higher altitudes, to escape attacks in a dive followed by a high-speed shallow climb, and to avoid prolonged turning engagements. Utilizing MW 50 both German fighters had superior performance at all altitudes. The La-5 had its defects. Perhaps the most serious was the thermal isolation of the engine, lack of ventilation in the cockpit, and a canopy that was impossible to open at speeds over 350 km/h. To make things worse, exhaust gas often entered the cockpit due to poor insulation of the engine compartment. Consequently, pilots ignored orders and frequently flew with their canopies open.Drabkin 2007, p. 148. In general, Soviet pilots appreciated the La-5 as an effective fighter. \\"That was an excellent fighter with two cannons and a powerful air-cooled engine\\", recalled pilot Viktor M. Sinaisky. \\"The first La-5s from the Tbilisi factory were slightly inferior, while the last ones from the Gorki plant, which came to us from Ivanovo, were perfect. At first we received regular La-5s, but then we got new ones containing the ASh-82FN engine with direct injection of fuel into the cylinders. It was perfected and had better maneuverability, acceleration, speed and climb rate compared to the early variants. Everyone was in love with the La-5. It was easy to maintain, too.\\"Drabkin 2007, p. 73. Nevertheless, La-5 losses were high, the highest of all fighters in service in USSR, excepting those of the Yak-1. In 1941–45, VVS KA lost 2,591 La-5s: 730 in 1942, 1,460 in 1943, 825 the following year, and 233 in 1945.Bergström 2008, p. 132.

Марка России 1477marka.jpgLa-5 on Russian stamp == Operational history == The La-5F arrived at the frontline in February 1943. It was able to challenge the Messerchmitt Bf 109G-2 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-4 on more or less equal terms, while at tree-top height it was even faster. One of the most successful La-5 units was 5 GIAP, that flew 3,802 combat sorties, claiming 128 enemy aircraft shot down while losing 52 Lavochkins.Bergstrom 2019, p. 195. == Operators == ; *Czechoslovakian Air Force like S-95 * Czechoslovakian National Security Guard ; *Mongolian People's Army Air Force ; *Polish Air Force – One aircraft only. ; *Soviet Air Force ==Surviving aircraft== An La-5 wreck is in storage at the Military Aviation Museum in Virginia Beach, Virginia. == Specifications (Lavochkin La-5FN) == == See also == == References Notes=Bibliography=== * Abanshin, Michael E. and Nina Gut.

Bone marrow suppression is a serious side effect of chemotherapy and certain drugs affecting the immune system such as azathioprine.Azathioprine side effects The risk is especially high in cytotoxic chemotherapy for leukemia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in some rare instances, may also cause bone marrow suppression. The decrease in blood cell counts does not occur right at the start of chemotherapy because the drugs do not destroy the cells already in the bloodstream (these are not dividing rapidly). Instead, the drugs affect new blood cells that are being made by the bone marrow.Bone marrow suppression When myelosuppression is severe, it is called myeloablation.Dictionary of Cancer Terms: myelosuppression Many other drugs including common antibiotics may cause bone marrow suppression. Unlike chemotherapy the effects may not be due to direct destruction of stem cells but the results may be equally serious. The treatment may mirror that of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression or may be to change to an alternate drug or to temporarily suspend treatment. Because the bone marrow is the manufacturing center of blood cells, the suppression of bone marrow activity causes a deficiency of blood cells. This condition can rapidly lead to life-threatening infection, as the body cannot produce leukocytes in response to invading bacteria and viruses, as well as leading to anaemia due to a lack of red blood cells and spontaneous severe bleeding due to deficiency of platelets. Parvovirus B19 inhibits erythropoiesis by lytically infecting RBC precursors in the bone marrow and is associated with a number of different diseases ranging from benign to severe. In immunocompromised patients, B19 infection may persist for months, leading to chronic anemia with B19 viremia due to chronic marrow suppression.Parvovirus B19 - BASICS ==Treatment== Bone marrow suppression due to azathioprine can be treated by changing to another medication such as mycophenolate mofetil (for organ transplants) or other disease-modifying drugs in rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. ===Chemotherapy induced myelosuppression=== Bone marrow suppression due to anti-cancer chemotherapy is much harder to treat and often involves hospital admission, strict infection control, and aggressive use of intravenous antibiotics at the first sign of infection. G-CSF is used clinically (see Neutropenia) but tests in mice suggest it may lead to bone loss.\\"Researchers urge monitoring of bone health during chemotherapy\\". GM-CSF has been compared to G-CSF as a treatment of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression/Neutropenia. ==Research== In developing new chemotherapeutics, the efficacy of the drug against the disease is often balanced against the likely level of myelotoxicity the drug will cause. In- vitro colony forming cell (CFC) assays using normal human bone marrow grown in appropriate semi-solid media such as ColonyGEL have been shown to be useful in predicting the level of clinical myelotoxicity a certain compound might cause if administered to humans.predicting-drug-induced-myelotoxicity These predictive in-vitro assays reveal effects the administered compounds have on the bone marrow progenitor cells that produce the various mature cells in the blood and can be used to test the effects of single drugs or the effects of drugs administered in combination with others. ==See also== * Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation * Neutropenia, low leukocytes == References == Category:Hematology Category:Oncology ","title":"Bone marrow suppression"},{"id":"530509","text":"Horst Feistel (January 30, 1915Both (Diffie and Landau, 1998), and (Levy, 2001) give Feistel's birth year as 1914.

The structure used in DES, called a Feistel network, is commonly used in many block ciphers. ==Life and work== Feistel was born in Berlin, Germany in 1915, and moved to the United States in 1934. During World War II, he was placed under house arrest, but nevertheless gained U.S. citizenship on 31 January 1944. The following day he was granted a security clearance and began work for the U.S. Air Force Cambridge Research Center (AFCRC) on Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) devices until the 1950s. He was subsequently employed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, then the MITRE corporation. Finally, he moved to IBM, where he received an award for his cryptographic work. His research at IBM led to the development of the Lucifer and Data Encryption Standard (DES) ciphers. Feistel was one of the earliest non- government researchers to study the design and theory of block ciphers. Feistel lent his name to the Feistel network construction, a common method for constructing block ciphers (for example DES).

It is also used to treat high blood calcium due to cancer and adrenal insufficiency along with other steroids. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects with long term use include cataracts, bone loss, easy bruising, muscle weakness, and thrush. Other side effects include weight gain, swelling, high blood sugar, increased risk of infection, and psychosis. It is generally considered safe in pregnancy and low doses appear to be safe when breastfeeding. After prolonged use, prednisone needs to be stopped gradually. Prednisone must be converted to prednisolone by the liver before it becomes active. Prednisolone then binds to glucocorticoid receptors, activating them and triggering changes in gene expression. Prednisone was patented in 1954 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 22nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Prednisone is used for many different autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions, including asthma, gout, COPD, CIDP, rheumatic disorders, allergic disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, adrenocortical insufficiency, hypercalcemia due to cancer, thyroiditis, laryngitis, severe tuberculosis, hives, lipid pneumonitis, pericarditis, multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, sarcoidosis, to relieve the effects of shingles, lupus, myasthenia gravis, poison oak exposure, Ménière's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, giant- cell arteritis, the Herxheimer reaction that is common during the treatment of syphilis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, uveitis, and as part of a drug regimen to prevent rejection after organ transplant. Prednisone has also been used in the treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headaches and for severe aphthous ulcer. Prednisone is used as an antitumor drug. It is important in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and other hormone-sensitive tumors, in combination with other anticancer drugs. Prednisone can be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to increase renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large dose of loop diuretics. In terms of the mechanism of action for this purpose: prednisone, a glucocorticoid, can improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by increasing the density of natriuretic peptide receptor type A in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, thereby inducing a potent diuresis. At high doses it may be used to prevent rejection following organ transplant. == Side effects == Micrograph of fatty liver, as may be seen due to long-term prednisone use. Trichrome stain. Short-term side effects, as with all glucocorticoids, include high blood glucose levels (especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or on other medications that increase blood glucose, such as tacrolimus) and mineralocorticoid effects such as fluid retention. The mineralocorticoid effects of prednisone are minor, which is why it is not used in the management of adrenal insufficiency, unless a more potent mineralocorticoid is administered concomitantly. It can also cause depression or depressive symptoms and anxiety in some individuals. Long-term side effects include Cushing's syndrome, steroid dementia syndrome, truncal weight gain, osteoporosis, glaucoma and cataracts, diabetes mellitus type 2, and depression upon dose reduction or cessation. Prednisone also results in leukocytosis. === Major === * Steroid myopathy * Increased blood sugar for individuals with diabetes * Difficulty controlling emotion * Difficulty in maintaining train of thought * Weight gain * Immunosuppression * Corticosteroid-induced lipodystrophy (moon face, central obesity) * Depression, mania, psychosis, or other psychiatric symptoms * Unusual fatigue or weakness * Mental confusion / indecisiveness * Memory and attention dysfunction (steroid dementia syndrome) * Muscle atrophy * Blurred vision * Abdominal pain * Peptic ulcer * Painful hips or shoulders * Steroid-induced osteoporosis * Stretch marks * Osteonecrosis – same as avascular necrosis * Insomnia * Severe joint pain * Cataracts or glaucoma * Anxiety * Black stool * Stomach pain or bloating * Severe swelling * Mouth sores or dry mouth * Avascular necrosis * Hepatic steatosis === Minor === * Nervousness * Acne * Skin rash * Appetite gain * Hyperactivity * Increased thirst * Frequent urination * Diarrhea * Reduced intestinal flora * Leg pain/cramps * Sensitive teeth * Headache * Induced vomiting === Dependency === Adrenal suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days. Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days if the course of prednisone was short, but may take weeks or months if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an Addison crisis. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects. Glucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the hypothalamus, decreasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland, decreasing the amount of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids. This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again. Prednisone may start to result in the suppression of the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis if used at doses 7–10 mg or higher for several weeks. This is approximately equal to the amount of endogenous cortisol produced by the body every day. As such, the HPA axis starts to become suppressed and atrophy. If this occurs the people should be tapered off prednisone slowly to give the adrenal gland enough time to regain its function and endogenous production of steroids. Supplemental doses, or \\"stress doses\\" may be required in those with HPA axis suppression who are experiencing a higher degree of stress (e.g., illness, surgery, trauma, etc.). Failing to do so in such situations could be life-threatening. === Withdrawal === The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have: * received more than 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for more than 1 week * been given repeat doses in the evening * received more than 3 weeks of treatment * recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than 3 weeks) * taken a short course within 1 year of stopping long-term therapy * other possible causes of adrenal suppression Systemic corticosteroids may be stopped abruptly in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and who have received treatment for 3 weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above. During corticosteroid withdrawal, the dose may be reduced rapidly down to physiological doses (equivalent to prednisolone 7.5 mg daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assessment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur. ==Pharmacology== Prednisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Prednisone is a prodrug; it is metabolised in the liver by 11-β-HSD to prednisolone, the active drug. Prednisone has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to prednisolone. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Prednisone is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and has a half life of 2–3 hours. it has a volume of distribution of 0.4–1 L/kg. The drug is cleared by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome P450 enzymes. Metabolites are excreted in the bile and urine. ==Industry== Prednisone 20 mg oral tablet The pharmaceutical industry uses prednisone tablets for the calibration of dissolution testing equipment according to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). ==Chemistry== Prednisone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisone and is also known as δ1-cortisone or 1,2-dehydrocortisone or as 17α,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione. ==History== The first isolation and structure identifications of prednisone and prednisolone were done in 1950 by Arthur Nobile. The first commercially feasible synthesis of prednisone was carried out in 1955 in the laboratories of Schering Corporation, which later became Schering-Plough Corporation, by Arthur Nobile and coworkers. They discovered that cortisone could be microbiologically oxidized to prednisone by the bacterium Corynebacterium simplex. The same process was used to prepare prednisolone from hydrocortisone. The enhanced adrenocorticoid activity of these compounds over cortisone and hydrocortisone was demonstrated in mice. Prednisone and prednisolone were introduced in 1955 by Schering and Upjohn, under the brand names Meticorten and Delta-Cortef, respectively. These prescription medicines are now available from a number of manufacturers as generic drugs. == See also == * Chloroprednisone == References == == External links == * * The National Center for Biotechnology Information: Prednisone * National Inventors Hall of Fame induction of Arthur Nobile Category:Appetite stimulants Category:Glucocorticoids Category:Mineralocorticoids Category:Prodrugs Category:Antiasthmatic drugs Category:Triketones Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Prednisone"},{"id":"530517","text":"Newton Falls may refer to: * Newton Falls, Ohio * Newton Falls, New York *Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts *Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts ","title":"Newton Falls"},{"id":"530525","text":"Hydrocortisone is the name for the hormone cortisol when supplied as a medication. Uses include conditions such as adrenocortical insufficiency, adrenogenital syndrome, high blood calcium, thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, asthma, and COPD. It is the treatment of choice for adrenocortical insufficiency. It can be given by mouth, topically, or by injection. Stopping treatment after long-term use should be done slowly. Side effects may include mood changes, increased risk of infection, and swelling. With long-term use common side effects include osteoporosis, upset stomach, physical weakness, easy bruising, and yeast infections. While used, it is unclear if it is safe during pregnancy. Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid and works as an anti- inflammatory and by immune suppression. Hydrocortisone was patented in 1936 and approved for medical use in 1941. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 154th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical term for cortisol used in oral administration, intravenous injection, or topical application. It is used as an immunosuppressive drug, given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients needing steroid treatment but unable to take oral medication, and perioperatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis. It may also be injected into inflamed joints resulting from diseases such as gout. It may be used topically for allergic rashes, eczema, psoriasis, itching and other inflammatory skin conditions. Topical hydrocortisone creams and ointments are available in most countries without prescription in strengths ranging from 0.05% to 2.5% (depending on local regulations) with stronger forms available by prescription only. Covering the skin after application increases the absorption and effect. Such enhancement is sometimes prescribed, but otherwise should be avoided to prevent overdose and systemic impact.

That is, it is an agonist of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Hydrocortisone has low potency relative to synthetic corticosteroids. Compared to hydrocortisone, prednisolone is about 4 times as potent and dexamethasone about 40 times as potent in terms of anti- inflammatory effect. Prednisolone can also be used as cortisol replacement, and at replacement dose levels (rather than anti-inflammatory levels), prednisolone is about eight times more potent than cortisol. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Most cortisol in the blood (all but about 4%) is bound to proteins, including corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and serum albumin. Free cortisol passes easily through cellular membranes, where it interacts with corticosteroid receptors. ==Chemistry== Hydrocortisone, also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid. A variety of hydrocortisone esters exist and have been marketed for medical use. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Alcohols Category:Antipruritics Category:Glucocorticoids Category:Mineralocorticoids Category:Ketones Category:Pregnanes Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:Orphan drugs ","title":"Hydrocortisone"},{"id":"530527","text":"Roddy Doyle (born 8 May 1958) is an Irish novelist, dramatist and screenwriter. He is the author of eleven novels for adults, eight books for children, seven plays and screenplays, and dozens of short stories. Several of his books have been made into films, beginning with The Commitments in 1991. Doyle's work is set primarily in Ireland, especially working-class Dublin, and is notable for its heavy use of dialogue written in slang and Irish English dialect. Doyle was awarded the Booker Prize in 1993 for his novel Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha. ==Personal life== Doyle was born in Dublin and grew up in Kilbarrack, in a middle-class family. His mother, Ita Bolger Doyle, was a first cousin of the short story writer Maeve Brennan.Angela Bourke, Maeve Brennan: Homesick at the New Yorker, 2004, Counterpoint Books, New York. Doyle graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from University College Dublin. He spent several years as an English and geography teacher before becoming a full-time writer in 1993. His personal notes and work books reside at the National Library of Ireland. In addition to teaching, Doyle, along with Seán Love, established a creative writing centre, \\"Fighting Words\\", which opened in Dublin in January 2009. It was inspired by a visit to his friend Dave Eggers' 826 Valencia project in San Francisco.Fighting Words web site He has also engaged in local causes, including signing a petition supporting journalist Suzanne Breen, who faced gaol for refusing to divulge her sources in court,Mark Sweney, \\"John Pilger and Roddy Doyle back journalist over Real IRA interviews\\".

Doyle is an atheist.Chilton, Martin. \\"Roddy Doyle interview\\". The Daily Telegraph. 22 September 2011. The 53-year-old Dubliner, who will be the headline performer at the start of the 10-day Telegraph Bath Festival of Children's Literature, said: \\"I'm an atheist so I suppose that was part of the challenge of writing about a ghost. Strictly speaking, I don't believe in anything. ==Work== Doyle's writing is marked by heavy use of dialogue between characters, with little description or exposition.\\"Our experience of Barrytown and the people that live there is constructed through the interplay of language, as Doyle's texts consist primarily of dialogue between various characters with a minimum of narrative exposition.\\" His work is largely set in Ireland, with a focus on the lives of working-class Dubliners. Themes range from domestic and personal concerns to larger questions of Irish history. ===Novels for adults=== Doyle's first three novels, The Commitments (1987), The Snapper (1990) and The Van (1991) comprise The Barrytown Trilogy, a trilogy centred on the Rabbitte family. All three novels were made into successful films. The Commitments is about a group of Dublin teenagers, led by Jimmy Rabbitte Jr., who decide to form a soul band in the tradition of Wilson Pickett. The novel was made into a film in 1991. The Snapper, made into a film in 1993, focuses on Jimmy's sister, Sharon, who becomes pregnant. She is determined to have the child but refuses to reveal the father's identity to her family. In The Van, which was shortlisted for the 1991 Booker Prize and made into a film in 1996, Jimmy Sr. is laid off, as is his friend Bimbo; the two buy a used fish and chips van and they go into business for themselves. In 1993, Doyle published Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, winner of the 1993 Man Booker Prize, which showed the world as described, understood and misunderstood by a ten-year-old Dubliner living in 1968. Doyle's next novel dealt with darker themes. The Woman Who Walked into Doors, published in 1996, is the story of a battered wife, narrated by the victim Paula Spencer; despite her husband's increasingly violent behaviour, she defends him, using the classic excuse \\"I walked into a door\\" to explain her bruises. Ten years later, the protagonist returned in Paula Spencer, published in 2006. Doyle's most recent trilogy of adult novels is The Last Roundup series, which follows the adventures of protagonist Henry Smart through several decades. A Star Called Henry (published 1999) is the first book in the series, and tells the story of Henry Smart, an IRA volunteer and 1916 Easter Rebellion fighter, from his birth in Dublin to his adulthood when he becomes a father. Oh, Play That Thing! (2004) continues Henry's story in 1924 America, beginning in the Lower East Side of New York City, where he catches the attention of local mobsters by hiring kids to carry his sandwich boards. He also goes to Chicago where he becomes a business partner with Louis Armstrong. The title is taken from a phrase that is shouted in one of Armstrong's songs, \\"Dippermouth Blues\\". In the final novel in the trilogy, The Dead Republic (published 2010), Henry collaborates on writing the script for a Hollywood film. He returns to Ireland and is offered work as the caretaker in a school, when circumstances lead to him re-establishing his link with the IRA. Doyle frequently posts short comic dialogues on his Facebook page which are implied to be between two older men in a pub, often relating to current events in Ireland (such as the 2015 marriage referendumMartin Doyle, \\"Roddy Doyle adds his Two Pints worth to marriage equality Yes vote campaign\\", The Irish Times, 1 May 2015.) and further afield. These developed into the novella Two Pints (2012). Other recent works are The Guts (2013), which continues the story of the Rabbitte family from the Barrytown Trilogy, focusing on a 48-year-old Jimmy Rabbite and his diagnosis of bowel cancer and Two More Pints (2014). ===Novels for children=== Doyle has also written many novels for children, including the \\"Rover Adventures\\" series,Roddy Doyle. (2012). In Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CH1000114801&v;=2.1&u;=ucdavis⁢=r&p;=LitRC&sw;=w which includes The Giggler Treatment (2000), Rover Saves Christmas (2001), and The Meanwhile Adventures (2004). Other children's books include Wilderness (2007), Her Mother's Face (2008), and A Greyhound of a Girl (2011). ===Plays, screenplays, short stories and non-fiction=== Doyle is also a prolific dramatist, composing four plays and two screenplays. His plays with the Passion Machine Theatre company include Brownbread (1987) and War (1989), directed by Paul Mercier with set and costume design by Anne Gately. Later plays include The Woman Who Walked into Doors (2003); and a rewrite of The Playboy of the Western World (2007) with Bisi Adigun. This latter play was the subject of litigation about copyright which ended with the Abbey Theatre agreeing to pay Adigun €600,000.Ronan McGreevy, \\"Abbey 'to pay €600,000' in dispute over play copyright\\", The Irish Times, 31 January 2013. Screenplays include the television screenplay for Family (1994), which was a BBC/RTÉ serial and the forerunner of the 1996 novel The Woman Who Walked into Doors. Doyle also authored When Brendan Met Trudy (2000), which is a romance about a timid schoolteacher (Brendan) and a free-spirited thief (Trudy). Doyle has written many short stories, several of which have been published in The New Yorker; they have also been compiled in two collections. The Deportees and Other Stories was published in 2007, while the collection Bullfighting was published in 2011. Doyle's story \\"New Boy\\" was adapted into a 2008 Academy Award-nominated short film directed by Steph Green. Rory and Ita (2002) is a work of non-fiction about Doyle's parents, based on interviews with them. The Commitments was adapted by Doyle for a musical which began in the West End in 2013. Two Pints (2017) was produced by the Abbey Theatre initially in pubs and later in the theatre itself. In 2018 the Gate Theatre commissioned Doyle to write a stage adaptation of The Snapper. The show was directed by Róisín McBrinn and was revived in 2019. ==Awards and honours== * Royal Society of Literature Fellow * 1991 Man Booker Prize shortlist for The Van * 1991 BAFTA Award (Best Adapted Screenplay) for The Commitments * 1993 Man Booker Prize for Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha * 2009 Irish PEN Award * 2011 French Literary Award (\\"Prix Littéraire des Jeunes Européens\\") for The Snapper * 2013 Bord Gáis Energy Irish Book Awards (Novel of the Year) for The GutsRoddy Doyle’s ‘The Guts’ named novel of the year Irish Times, 2013-11-27. * 2015 Honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) from University of Dundee ==In popular culture== In the television series Father Ted, the character Father Dougal Maguire's unusual sudden use of (mild) profanities (such as saying \\"I wouldn't know, Ted, you big bollocks!\\") is blamed on his having \\"been reading those Roddy Doyle books again.\\" ==BibliographyNovels=== * Love (2020) * Charlie Savage (2019) * Smile (2017) ;The Barrytown Pentalogy * The Commitments (1987, 1991 film) * The Snapper (1990, 1993 film) * The Van (1991) ; 1996 film) * Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (1993) * The Guts (2013) ;Paula Spencer novels * The Woman Who Walked into Doors (1996) * Paula Spencer (2006) ;The Last Roundup * A Star Called Henry (1999) * Oh, Play That Thing!

The population is estimated at 364,700 in 1998. It is the capital of Babylon Province and is located adjacent to the ancient city of Babylon, and close to the ancient cities of Borsippa and Kish. It is situated in a predominantly agricultural region which is extensively irrigated with water provided by the Hilla canal, producing a wide range of crops, fruit and textiles. Its name may be derived from the word \\"beauty\\" in Arabic. The river runs exactly in the middle of the town, and it is surrounded by date palm trees and other forms of arid vegetation, reducing the harmful effects of dust and desert wind. The city was once a major center of Islamic scholarship and education. The tomb of the Jewish prophet Ezekiel is reputed to be located in a nearby village, Al Kifl. It became a major administrative centre during the rule of the Ottoman and British Empires. In the 19th century, the Hilla branch of the Euphrates started to silt up and much agricultural land was lost to drought, but this process was reversed by the construction of the Hindiya Barrage in 1911–1913, which diverted water from the deeper Hindiya branch of the Euphrates into the Hilla canal. It saw heavy fighting in 1920 during an uprising against the British, when 300 men of the Manchester Regiment were apparently defeated in the city. ==HistoryBabylon=== Hillah is located near the ruins of ancient Babylon. It is likely that Babylon was founded in the third millennium BC and rose to prominence over the next thousand years. By the 18th century BC the city was the centre of the empire of Hammurabi. Various empires controlled Babylon over the following centuries. Babylon briefly regained independence during the Neo-Babylonian empire towards the end of the 7th century BC, most notably under the reign of king Nebuchadnezzar II, but came under Persian rule in the 6th century BC. In the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great captured Babylon. Babylon remained a notable Persian province until the 7th century AD, and then fell into decline. The ruins of Babylon have suffered greatly due to looting and destructive policies. Parts of Nebuchadnezzar's palace and some of the old city walls still remain. Saddam Hussein commissioned a non-scientific, much controversial \\"restoration\\" of ancient Babylon on part of the site, in the process destroying much of the ancient site all the way to the foundations for the purpose. A modern palace was constructed for him on what was purported to have been Nebuchadnezzar ancient palace. A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is displayed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. ===Birth of Hillah=== In the 10th century, the town of Al Jami'ayn was founded on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. The location of that town is in modern-day Hillah now. In 1101 AD a new town was founded near Al Jami'ayn. Bricks were taken from Babylon to build houses and so Hillah expanded. During the 18th century, the town became an administrative center in the Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century, the flow in the al-Hillah stream decreased, and that led to worsening conditions for agriculture, which affected them greatly. To solve the problem, al-Hindiya Barrage was built. ===Invasion of Iraq in 2003=== Hillah was the scene of relatively heavy fighting in the 2003 invasion of Iraq on and around April 1, 2003. Iraqi casualties from the Medina Division of the Republican Guard were unknown but heavy, with several hundred reported to have been killed in fierce fighting with the United States Army's 2-70th Armor. After the battle with the Medina Division the US Army forces moved to Baghdad and the U.S. Marine forces took over responsibilities in Al Hillah. Shortly after the invasion a mass grave site was reported by locals to be in the area around Hillah. Local citizens and members of ORHA worked together to exhume thousands of Iraqis who had been killed by Saddam Hussein's security forces during the uprising against his government in 1991. U.S. Marines in Babylon ruins The 1st Marine Division had established a base at one of Saddam Hussein's palaces about one mile north of Hillah. The 372nd Military Police Company had performed law and order and Iraqi Police training in the city from June 2003 to October 2003 prior to moving on to Abu Ghraib prison. The city was part of the Polish military zone under the occupation of Iraq.
