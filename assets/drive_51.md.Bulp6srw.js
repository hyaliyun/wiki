He is of one quarter Sicilian descent, on his mother's side. He has two older siblings, Shannon and David.

Scott's name appears next to Jon Hamm's name in the film Anchorman in one of the broadcast's credits. In an appearance on G4's Attack of the Show! program on April 21, 2011, he confirmed that this was due to his and Hamm's friendship with producer Shauna Robertson, who put their names in the credits as an Easter egg. He played Ted Hendricks, Walter Mitty's detestable corporate boss, in the 2013 remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Scott appeared in the films Our Idiot Brother (2011) as Jeremy and Bachelorette. He also starred as Jason Fryman in Friends with Kids (2012). He starred as Caleb Sinclaire in the 2010 film The Vicious Kind, a more dramatic role than his previous comedic endeavors, for which Scott was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor. The film itself received positive reviews, and he won two individual awards at two separate film festivals. He starred in the film Passenger Side, released on DVD on October 26, 2010.

The series is introduced at the outset of each episode as \\"the comprehensive and encyclopedic compendium of all things U2,\\" but it generally uses discussion of the band as a jumping off point for improv and absurdist humor. In February 2018 Scott and Scott launched another podcast in the same format, this time covering the career and work of the band R.E.M., titled R U Talkin' R.E.M. Re: Me?. A third podcast, R U Talkin' RHCP Re: Me?, debuted in July 2020, in which Scott and Scott discuss the Red Hot Chili Peppers; the podcast's format was almost immediately abandoned in favor of discussing Talking Heads and, as of the second episode, was renamed U Talkin' Talking Heads 2 My Talking Head.

Though he appeared in only 72 career games, he became a cult hero on the South Side due primarily to his stature. Chappas was measured by Harry Caray and publicly declared to be , an inch or two shorter than established star Freddie Patek. He was one of the shortest players in Major League history, although Chappas stated in an interview in Sports Illustrated that he was closer to , and implied that team owner Bill Veeck exaggerated his short stature for publicity reasons. Chappas' professional baseball career began with the barnstorming Negro league Indianapolis Clowns, who had become racially integrated, and had developed into more of an entertainment product than a competitive team. When Chappas later made his major league debut, he became the final ex-Negro leaguer to make the major leagues, and the first white ex-Negro leaguer to do so. Chappas signed with the White Sox in 1976 as a sixth round draft pick. He impressed Veeck with good performances for the Appleton Foxes in 1978. This earned Chappas a September callup, during which he hit an effective .267 in 20 games. Primarily due to his height, he gained more and more national interest, highlighted by an appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated during spring training in 1979. In spring training that year, Chappas unseated veteran Don Kessinger and became the opening day shortstop. He lost his job after two weeks after missing a sign as a baserunner, only returning in September. Chappas made the opening day roster the following year as well, but only as a reserve player, and he was subsequently sent to the minors after hitting .160 in 50 at bats. Overall, Chappas hit .245 in the majors and hit a single home run, off the Brewers' Bill Travers, in 1979. ==ReferencesExternal links== , or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Appleton Foxes players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:American expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Baseball players from Maryland Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Edmonton Trappers players Category:Glens Falls White Sox players Category:Indianapolis Clowns players Category:Iowa Oaks players Category:Knoxville Sox players Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Miami Dade College alumni Category:Miami Dade Sharks baseball players Category:People from Mount Rainier, Maryland Category:Savannah Braves players Category:Sultanes de Monterrey players Category:Tigres de Aragua players ","title":"Harry Chappas"},{"id":"1999434","text":"C64 cover for Last Ninja Remix The Last Ninja is a series of video games published by System 3. The first game in the series, titled The Last Ninja, was released in 1987 for the Commodore 64 and was one of the most successful games for the system. In 1988, System 3 released Last Ninja 2, and in 1991 the third game in the series, Last Ninja 3. In 1990, Last Ninja Remix was released for 8-bit systems. This was Last Ninja 2 with new music, a new introductory sequence, slightly changed graphics (most notably the screen border) and fixed bugs. Confusingly, the 16-bit versions of the original The Last Ninja game were also released in 1990 as Ninja Remix. ==Plot== The protagonist of The Last Ninja series is Armakuni, the sole survivor of a ninjutsu clan that was destroyed by an evil shogun named Kunitoki. This struggle leads our hero to the island of Lin Fen (in the first Last Ninja) to modern day New York City (in Last Ninja 2) and to the mystical Buddhist temple in Tibet (in Last Ninja 3). In each of the games, Kunitoki is the final adversary and every time eludes death after a somewhat decisive victory from Armakuni. ==Gameplay== Each game is divided into a number of self-contained locations, with the original game containing six such 'levels'. Each level is loaded separately, in sequence as the game progresses. Game over takes the player back to the start of the current level. Each location was presented as a map of static isometric screens, with the player's character restricted to predefined paths (the scenery was inaccessible). By 8-bit standards, the graphics were very detailed, and on many platforms the screen would take a second or so to draw itself when entered. The gameplay generally consisted of fighting, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Movement and fighting was done on the joystick, and the keyboard was used to select items and weapons that the player had to acquire. The player could select one active weapon and one item at any given time. Many map screens contained opponents which the ninja could avoid (by exiting a screen before they caught him) or fight using his selected weapon. (In later Last Ninja games defeated enemies would revive after a certain amount of time.) Items would flash briefly when a screen was first entered, and could be picked up when standing close to them, usually triggering a crouching animation that was also often employed when using the object. Most of the puzzles were of the item-finding or precision-jumping variety. ==Series history== *The Last Ninja: Commodore 64 (1987), DOS (1988), Acorn Electron (1988), BBC Micro (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), Apple II (1989), Acorn Archimedes (1992), Virtual Console (2008) *Ninja Remix: Amiga (1990), Atari ST (1990) *Last Ninja 2: Commodore 64 (1988), ZX Spectrum (1988), Amstrad CPC (1988), Acorn Electron (1989), BBC Micro (1989), Amiga (1990), Atari ST (1990), DOS (1990), NES (1990, as The Last Ninja), Virtual Console (2008) *Last Ninja Remix: Commodore 64 (1990), ZX Spectrum (1990), Amstrad CPC (1990) *Last Ninja 3: Commodore 64 (1991), Amiga (1991), Atari ST (1991), Amiga CD32 (1993), Virtual Console (2008) *Last Ninja 4: C64 (cancelled) *Last Ninja: PC and possibly PlayStation (cancelled) *Last Ninja: The Return/The Last Ninja - Return to Lin Fen Island: PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube (cancelled) Generally the games had been made with Commodore 64 as the lead platform, with other platforms getting less attention (sometimes the porters didn't even receive the C64 version's data, and had to reconstruct the entire game from scratch). Versions of The Last Ninja for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Acorn Archimedes/RISC OS computers were published by Superior Software, while Activision published it for the Apple IIGS. One novel feature on the C64 version was the use of very distinctive oriental music in loading and in-game music for each level. These original music pieces on the first Last Ninja were composed by C64 musician Ben Daglish doing five tunes and Anthony Lees doing six tunes. In the sequel, Last Ninja 2, Matt Gray composed all the tunes. What separated The Last Ninja series from most other games was that in C64 version all three SID sound channels were dedicated to music playback, meaning that there were no in-game sounds. Reyn Ouwehand provided the new music used in the C64 version of Last Ninja Remix. ===Last Ninja 4=== In 1993, John Wells created a series of previews, music and a map for one level of a fourth game which he tried to convince System 3 to make. System 3 turned him down.Review - Last Ninja 4 - Games That Weren't 64 (GTW64) Originally set for an early 2004 release, a new Last Ninja game was shown at the E3 2003 Expo in Los Angeles, but has since been delayed. Released screenshots showed a game looking very similar to Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden, also in development at the time (released in early 2004).Last Ninja 4 screenshots Retro Gamer reported they \\"that Play It is to release the original Last Ninja trilogy on PS2. The graphics will be enhanced, but the gameplay and puzzles will remain intact. Again, this will be released in the next few months and priced at a very economical £10. It will also serve as a perfect appetiser for the fully 3D’d up Last Ninja 4, due out next year.\\"Retro Gamer 7, page 6. A new game has also been said to be cancelled at least three times, only to return to development. In 2007, System 3 CEO, Mark Cale, said the fourth Last Ninja was scrapped because it \\"simply wasn't good enough\\" and stated that Last Ninja would be returning in the form of a remade trilogy for Nintendo DS and Wii.LN4 News - Last Ninja Archives Cale said: \\"We’ve scrapped the fourth game. I felt it wasn’t representative of the market. For Last Ninja 4, I think you need to do something that recreates that kind of ‘wow’ factor of the original game, and in my mind it wasn’t good enough to wear that badge – so why cash in on a great name? We may as well leave it as it is. There will definitely be a fourth game. It’ll either be a retro version with updated graphics but the same gameplay, or something that’s going to be an epic, like a Final Fantasy game but with a more arcade feel.\\"Retro Gamer 18, page 57. ==Reception== In 2010, GamePro included Armakuni in their article \\"Top Ten video game ninjas\\" (\\"If Rambo had been born in Feudal Japan, he’d be a lot like Armakuni\\").Top Ten video game ninjas, GamePro, 6 August 2010.

He famously changed the name of Grauman's Chinese Theatre to Mann's Chinese Theater when he purchased the National General Theatre chain that owned it in 1973. ==Biography== Born to a Jewish family in Wishek, North Dakota, Mann started off in the movie business as an usher around the time he attended the University of Minnesota in the 1930s. He rented the Selby Theatre in Saint Paul, Minnesota for $100 a month running it as a one-man shop serving as ticket seller and projectionist. He was successful and he went on to purchase 25 other theaters and drive-ins in the Midwest. In 1970, Mann sold his theater chain to General Cinema Corporation (founded by Philip Smith and then led by Richard A. Smith) and moved to California. The first production to his credit was 1969's The Illustrated Man, based on a Ray Bradbury book. He didn't stay out of the theater business for long, and purchased the troubled 276-screen National General Theatre chain in 1973. Mann soon expanded the chain to 360 screens, but again sold off his theaters in 1986, this time to Gulf+Western, which later renamed itself to Paramount Communications (which itself became part of Viacom). Grauman's Theater eventually regained its original name in late 2001. Both the Orpheum and Pantages venues of today's Hennepin Theatre District in Minneapolis were once owned by Mann. He eventually owned at least six theaters in the city's downtown region. The Ted Mann Concert Hall at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis is named for him. ==Philanthropy== In 1984, he founded the Ted Mann Foundation which contributed to the Salvation Army, Boys & Girls Clubs, United Way, Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the United Jewish Fund, Operation Exodus, and the Jerusalem Foundation. ==Personal life== On June 24, 1934, Ted Mann married Ida Charon (1911–1997). Before their divorce, Ted and Ida Mann had two daughters, Victoria Mann Sims and Roberta Lynn Mann-Benson (died 2010). He married actress Rhonda Fleming in 1977, and they remained together until Mann died at age 84 in Los Angeles of complications from a stroke. Upon his death he was survived by, in addition to Fleming, two daughters, a sister Edythe, two grandsons, and two granddaughters. ==FilmographyProducer/executive producer=== *The Illustrated Man (1969) *Buster and Billie (1974) *Lifeguard (1976) *The Nude Bomb (1980) *Brubaker (1980) *Krull (1983) ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Jason Buchanan.

She was the founder of Lesbian Feminist Liberation, one of the first lesbian activist groups in the women's movement, and an early member and co-director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. She co-founded National Coming Out Day. Before becoming a lesbian and gay rights activist she was a Roman Catholic religious sister. She would later write about her experience in a 1985 anthology, Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence. ==Early life== O'Leary was born in Kingston, New York, and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1966, just out of high school, she entered the novitiate of the Sisters of the Humility of Mary, of Villa Maria, Pennsylvania, in order to \\"have an impact on the world\\". In 1971, after graduating from Cleveland State University with a degree in psychology, she left the convent before completing the period of training. ==Activism== Christopher Street Liberation Day in New York City. In 1971 O'Leary moved to New York City and did doctoral studies in organization development at Yeshiva University. As a lesbian during this period, she became involved with the nascent gay rights movement, joining the Gay Activists' Alliance (GAA) Chapter in Brooklyn and later lobbying state politicians. In 1972, feeling that it was too dominated by the men of the movement, she left the GAA and founded Lesbian Feminist Liberation, one of the first lesbian activist groups in the women's movement. Two years later, she joined the National Gay Task Force, negotiating gender parity in its executive with director Bruce Voeller, joining as co-executive director. In 1977 O'Leary organized the first meeting of gay rights activists at the White House through arrangements made with White House staffer Midge Costanza. She was the first openly gay person appointed to a presidential commission, the National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year, by Jimmy Carter. In this role she negotiated for gay and lesbian rights to be included on the discussion in a conference marking the year in Houston, Texas. O'Leary was among three openly gay delegates to the United States Democratic Party convention in 1976. She also served on the Democratic National Committee for 12 years, 8 of those on the executive committee. During the early 1980s, O'Leary focused on building National Gay Rights Advocates, then one of the largest national gay and lesbian rights groups. It was one of the first to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic's implications for legal and civil liberties, using aggressive litigation to ensure AIDS patients' access to treatment. She co-founded National Coming Out Day with Rob Eichberg in 1988. === Radical lesbian feminism and anti-trans views === In a speech given at the 1973 Christopher Street Liberation Day, O'Leary read a statement on behalf of 100 women that read, in part, \\"We support the right of every person to dress in the way that she or he wishes. But we are opposed to the exploitation of women by men for entertainment or profit.\\" In response, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster, both self-identified drag queens, jumped onstage and responded, \\"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!\\" In the early 1970s, O'Leary and other gay liberation activists did not actively include all transsexuals and transvestites in proposed gay rights legislation,At the time, the term \\"gay\\" was commonly used to refer to all lesbian and gay people. Those we now refer to as transgender, and gay-identified bisexuals, were also included under this term if they participated socially in the lesbian and gay community. However, the umbrella terms \\"LGBT\\", \\"transgender\\", and \\"queer\\" were not yet in popular usage during these years. largely due to the belief that this would make basic legislation too difficult to pass at the time. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \\"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\\" \\"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\\" O'Leary was referring to the Lavender Menace, a description by second wave feminist Betty Friedan for attempts by members of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971. ==Personal life== She and her partner, Lisa Phelps, had a daughter (Victoria) and a son (David de Maria). O'Leary died on June 4, 2005, in San Clemente, California, of lung cancer, aged 57. ==Legacy== Season 2, episodes 4 and 5 of the podcast Making Gay History are about her. O'Leary, and her advocacy for the inclusion of lesbian and gay rights in the 1977 National Women's Conference, is portrayed by Canadian actress Anna Douglas in the FX television miniseries Mrs America. ==Notes References == Category:1948 births Category:2005 deaths Category:20th-century Christian nuns Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Former Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:LGBT Roman Catholics Category:Lesbian feminists Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Activists from New York (state) Category:Activists from Ohio Category:Catholics from New York (state) Category:Catholics from Ohio Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:LGBT people from Ohio Category:People from Cleveland Category:People from Kingston, New York Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Cleveland State University alumni Category:Yeshiva University alumni Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Jean O'Leary"},{"id":"1999484","text":"Seed ball Activities for making Mud Seed ball Mud Seed ball drying mud seed balls in shed Plants sprouting from seedball. Community seedballing event. Masanobu Fukuoka, throwing the first seedball at the workshop at Navdanya, in October 2002. Seed balls, also known as \\"earth balls\\" or , consist of a variety of different seeds rolled within a ball of clay, preferably volcanic pyroclastic red clay. Various additives may be included, such as humus or compost. These are placed around the seeds, at the center of the ball, to provide microbial inoculants. Cotton-fibres or liquefied paper are sometimes mixed into the clay in order to strengthen it, or liquefied paper mash coated on the outside to further protect the clay ball during sowing by throwing, or in particularly harsh habitats. ==Development of technique== Activities for Mud Seed ball on world environment day in Bhopal The technique for creating seed balls was rediscovered by Japanese natural farming pioneer Masanobu Fukuoka. The technique was also used, for instance, in ancient Egypt to repair farms after the annual spring flooding of the Nile. In modern times, during the period of the Second World War, this Japanese government plant scientist working in a government lab, Fukuoka, who lived on the mountainous island of Shikoku, wanted to find a technique that would increase food production without taking away from the land already allocated for traditional rice production which thrived in the volcanic rich soils of Japan. ==Construction== To make a seed ball, generally about five measures of red clay by volume are combined with one measure of seeds. The balls are formed between 10mm and 80mm (about 0.4 to 3.15 inches) in diameter. After the seed balls have been formed, they must dry for 24-48 hours before use. ==Seed bombingHistory of seed bombing=== Seed bombing is the practice of introducing vegetation to land by throwing or dropping seed balls. It was made popular by green movements such as guerrilla gardening as a way to practice active reforestation. Seed balls were also experimentally used in aerial seeding in Kenya in 2016. This was an attempt to improve the yield of standard aerial seeding. Aerial seeding (or aerial reforestation) is the technique of spreading seeds from an airplane, helicopter or a similar flying transport. It can be considered a particular type of direct seeding: as such, it introduces seeds directly in the field and it is often not economical due to the issues of germination, pests and seed predation by rodents or other wild animals. Transplanting seedlings from a plant nursery to the field is a more effective sowing technique. Aerial seeding has a low yield and require 25% to 50% more seeds than drilled seeding to achieve the same results. It is sometimes used as a technique to plant cover crops without having to wait for the main crop's off-season. The earliest attempts at aerial reforestation date back to the 1930s. In this period, planes were used to distribute seeds over certain inaccessible mountains in Honolulu after forest fires. These experiments were largely unsuccessful, because of poor seed dispersal: seeds failed to obtain enough kinetic energy to enter the soil and as a result were massively predated. This in turn generated an infestation of rodents in Hawaii. The use of seed balls, instead of simple seeds, to perform aerial reforestation in Kenya seems to have produced desirable results. Chardust Ltd, the company involved and distributing seed balls for that project, claims to have sold and distributed over 7 million seedballs, as per August 2019. It is likely, though, that the majority of these seed balls are deployed traditionally instead than via aerial seeding and there is no published data to support the benefits of using seed balls via aerial seeding. In 1987, Lynn Garrison proposed the creation of a Haitian Aerial Reforestation Project (HARP), by which tons of seed would be scattered from specially modified aircraft. The seeds would be encapsulated in an absorbent material. This coating would contain fertilizer, insecticide/animal repellent and, perhaps a few vegetable seeds. Haiti has a bimodal rainy season, with precipitation in spring and fall. The seeds could have been moistened a few days before the drop, to start germination. Unfortunately the project never came to fruition. Another more recent project idea was to use saplings instead of seeds in aerial. Saplings would be encased in sturdy and biodegradable containers which would work as projectiles and pierce the ground at high velocity. This would likely guarantee a better yield when compared to simple aerial seeding or even seed bombing. This project was being developed in 1999 by a company called Aerial Reforestation Inc, in Newton, Massachusetts, based on an original idea by pilot Jack Walters. The company was planning to use military transport aircraft C-130, traditionally used to lay out landmines on combat fields. As per 2019 the company does not seem to be operating anymore. Other researchers are still investigating the potential of these \\"aerial sapling darts\\", by improving their aerodynamics to achieve better soil penetration and therefore higher reforestation yields. More research is needed to assess exactly their performance against other reforestation methods. The most recent attempt at Seed Bombing is performed by DroneSeed, a company that has become operative in 2019. They claim to have devised a proprietary seed bomb that is able to deter animals from eating the seeds and, by using a mix of different seeds in the same bomb, to maximize the yield of the tree planting operations. Given the focus of this company on disaster relief, they have considered sapling darts not to be an effective solution since \\"nursery suppliers lack capacity to reforest after sizeable wildfires — especially repeat fires.\\" ===Feasibility and weaknesses=== The perfect seedball: The seedball planting technique was developed by Masanobu Fukuoka, and it's an effective way to seed large areas, such as meadows or wild lands, with grasses and trees. Seedball is a mixture of clay and various seeds, that allows the seeds to stay protected inside the ball until it rains, and the conditions become favorable for sprouting. Despite its low yield, interest in aerial seeding has recently grown, while searching for a quick system to obtain reforestation and fight global warming. The advantage of using an airplane/helicopter is the ability to quickly seed large areas, even remote areas, otherwise impractical to be used in active reforestation. Aerial seeding is therefore best suited to sites whose remoteness, ruggedness, inaccessibility, or sparse population make seedling planting difficult. It is particularly appropriate for \\"protection forests\\" because helicopters or planes can easily spread seed over steep slopes or remote watersheds and isolated dryland areas. It seems also well suited for use in areas where there may be a dearth of skilled laborers, supervisors, and funds for reforestation. It has the potential to help increase production of tree crops for forage, food, and honey as well as wood for fuel, posts, lumber, charcoal and pulp. Seed balls and aerial reforestation are heavily sensitive to environmental conditions. Seeds deployment may not be practical in some cases because the site may require preparation or the season may be wrong. To germinate successfully, seeds usually must fall directly onto mineral soil rather than onto established vegetation or undecomposed organic matter. Where organic matter has accumulated thickly, the site must normally be burned, furrowed, or disked. The soil disturbance left after logging is often sufficient. Rough terrain is more amenable to broadcast seeding, but yields are typically low even in the best conditions. On certain sites ground preparation may be necessary. Site preparation and the seeding operation must be well coordinated to meet the biological requirements for prompt seed germination and seeding survival. Dry sites may have to be specially ridged or disked so as to optimize the rainfall that reaches the seed. Excessively wet sites may need to be ridged or drained. The degree of field slope is not critical as long as seeds find a receptive seedbed. Steep watersheds, eroding mountain slopes, bare hillsides, and spoil-banks where vegetation is sparse are often suitable for aerial seeding (however, on some steep slopes with smooth, bare soil, rain may wash the seeds away too easily for successful seeding). Arid and savanna lands (for example, those where annual rainfall is under 800 mm) are most in need of reforestation. These are regions where aerial seeding in principle has exceptional potential. They include vast tracts of unused or poorly used land that has sparse tree cover and that is not confined to private land holdings, so it is generally accessible to aircraft. The native trees (such as species of Acacia, and other genera) in these areas are generally well adapted for survival under difficult field conditions. These are not species for timber as much as for firewood, forage, fruit, gum, erosion control, and other such uses. An imperfect seedball? Seeds in seedball at Uprange, Kahoolawe, Hawaii. As a prerequisite to any method of reforestation, the species selected must be adapted to the temperature, length of growing season, rainfall, humidity, photoperiod, and other environmental features of the area. Ideally, before aerial seeding takes place trial plots should be established to test those species most likely to germinate and grow successfully on the chosen sites. Even when one species has the right characteristics, it may be prudent to test seed of different provenances to find those best suited to the site. Characteristics that make a particular species more or less appropriate for aerial seeding include: * seed size * seed availability * ability of the seed to germinate on the soil surface * germination and seedling growth speeds * ability to withstand temperature extremes and prolonged dry periods (orthodox seed) * ability to tolerate soil conditions * light tolerance * seed stability when stored in large quantities * suitability of seed for handling with mechanical seeding devices, * development speed of a deep taproot by seedlings to enable them to withstand adverse climatic conditions in the period following germination. Species with highly palatable seeds have little prospect of success because wildlife eat the seed before it has a chance to germinate unless it is pelletized. Also, small seeds and lightweight, chaffy seeds are more likely to drift in the wind, so they are harder to target during the drop. Small seeds, however, fall into crevices and are then more likely to get covered with soil, thereby enhancing their chances of survival. Aerial seeding may prove to work best with \\"pioneer\\" species, which germinate rapidly on open sites, are adapted for growth on bare or disturbed areas, and grow well in direct sunlight. ===Aerial seeding deployment methods==Crop Spraying Aircraft==== It is the most common method and the one practiced by Farmland Aviation, Kenya, one of the few companies active in this field. They claim to be able to spread up to six tons of tree seeds per hour over tens of thousands of acres. ====Unmanned Aerial Vehicles==== Until recently (2017), drones were not used in aerial seeding. Low-cost UAV's lacked payload capacity and range limits them for most aerial seeding applications. A drone developed by Parrot SA and BioCarbon Engineering however has solved this issue. It is capable of dropping 100 000 pods a day.Spray Tree Seeds From the Sky to Fight DeforestationNew Drone Plans an Ambitious Mission to Plant 100,000 Trees a Day ====Paragliding==== This deployment method is being tested in Kenya and holds promises of great reforestation rates because of low cost, low speed and altitudes, even if seed spraying rate is likely to be much slower than deployment by aircraft. ==Guerrilla gardening== The term \\"seed green-aide\\" was first used by Liz Christy in 1973 when she started the \\"Green Guerrillas\\". The first seed green-aides were made from condoms filled with tomato seeds, and fertilizer. They were tossed over fences onto empty lots in New York City in order to make the neighborhoods look better. It was the start of the guerrilla gardening movement. ==See also== * The One-Straw Revolution *Miss Rumphius by Barbara Cooney, a 1982 children's book emphasizing public seed scattering * Seed dispersal * Johnny Appleseed * Operation Overgrow * Diggers ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Smith, K.

The focus of GLISA is developing gay and lesbian sport worldwide. This is engineered through sanctioning world and continental games, creating a global calendar of GLBT events, fostering the creation of new LGBT federations, clubs and teams, supporting existing LGBT sport organizations, working in partnership with other sport organization to pursue this mandate, and providing the financial framework to support GLISA's global efforts. The Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association is a democratically governed, international association of LGBT sport and human rights organizations from around the world. Modeled after existing multi-sport organizations, GLISA’s members were international sporting federations, human rights organizations, continental associations representing sport teams and clubs from the major regions of the world, host cities of GLISA’s World OutGames, and other organizations that support the mandate of GLISA. GLISA expands LGBT rights by requiring that a human rights conference be included at every event sanctioned as an Outgames. In fact, the first worldOutgames in Montreal produced the Declaration of Montreal. Recent events stemming from the organization and subsequent cancellation of the 2016 Asia Pacific Outgames, 2016 North American Outgames and 2017 World Outgames. GLISA has failed to achieved this vision and has accomplished a lot to damage the greater LGBTQ+ Sports Community. Many LGBTQ+ Activists are calling on GLISA and the Outgames brand to formally dismantle and dissolve. ==History== GLISA was formed by an international working group brought together by the Montreal 2006 organizers. In 2003, the Federation of Gay Games (FGG) withdrew its sanction of Montreal, because of a dispute over the size of the event and demands of overall control of the Montreal 2006 budget by the FGG. Through an informal survey, Montreal found that several athletes and organizations were willing to participate in the event even if the FGG did not want to come to an agreement with the Montreal 2006 organizers. Montreal 2006, with support from its partners including the city of Montreal, the Province of Québec and the Federal government decided to go forward with the event. In order to create a legacy for the games—and a newly integrated concept: a human rights conference—Montreal 2006 organizers brought representatives from every continent to form an organization that would reflect the needs of the wider community. Out of this meeting of representatives sprung the Gay and Lesbian International \\"Sport\\" Association and a new sport, culture and human rights event: the World OutGames. GLISA licensed the first edition of the World Outgames to Montreal 2006. GLISA licensed the rights the second edition of the World Outgames Copenhagen, Denmark 2008. Antwerp, Belgium hosted the sport, culture and human rights event in 2013. The next world Outgames was scheduled to be held in 2017 in Miami Beach, Florida, USA but was abruptly cancelled on the first day of the event. ===Regional outgames=== Since establishing the World Outgames, GLISA has also supported the establishment of continental outgames, including the North American Outgames and the AsiaPacific Outgames, are held every three years. In 2007, the North American Outgames were held in Calgary and the 2008 Asia-Pacific Outgames were held in Melbourne. In 2011, the North American Outgames were held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and the Asia-Pacific Outgames were held in Wellington. Darwin, Australia hosted the 3rd Asia- Pacific Outgames in May 2014. Both the 2016 Asia Pacific and North American Outgames were subsequently cancelled due to massive disorganization.

He attended St Paul's School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied Sanskrit and the classics. In 1896, he achieved a first-class result in mods, and was awarded a Boden Scholarship in Sanskrit in 1897. He was given honorable mentions for the Hertford (1895), Ireland (1896) and Craven (1896) scholarships. Clementi was proxime accessit (runner-up) for the Gaisford Greek Prose prize in 1897, and obtained his B.A. (2nd class lit. hum., i.e. classics) in 1898. Clementi was also proxime accessit for the Chancellor's Latin Essay prize in 1899, and obtained his M.A. in 1901. ==Early colonial service== In 1899, Clementi placed fourth in the competitive examinations for the civil service, which allowed him his choice of postings. His choice was Hong Kong, and upon his arrival he was sent up to Canton, where he was a land officer until forced to return to Hong Kong by the events of the Boxer Rebellion. Clementi's facility with languages was demonstrated when he passed the Cantonese examination in 1900, and the Pekingese examination six years later, in 1906. After serving as an Assistant Registrar General in 1901, Clementi joined as a member of the Board of Examiners in Chinese, in 1902. In 1902, Clementi was seconded for special service under government of India and was created J.P. in that same year. A year later, he was seconded for famine relief work in Kwangsi (Guangxi). A year afterwards, Clementi was appointed Member of Land Court, Assistant Land Officer and Police Magistrate at New Territories, Hong Kong, a position he served in until 1906. Due to his outstanding performance in the services, Clementi was promoted to Assistant Colonial Secretary and Clerk of Council, in 1907. While he was in that position, Clementi represented the Hong Kong government in the International Opium Conference at Shanghai, in 1909. A year later, he became the Private Secretary to the Administrator at that time, Sir Francis Henry May. Clementi eventually became Acting Colonial Secretary and Member of both the Executive and Legislative Councils of Hong Kong. He would remain there until 1912. Clementi played a part in the founding of the University of Hong Kong. Indeed, he wrote the words, in Latin, of the University Anthem, first performed 11 March 1912. In 1913, Clementi was appointed Colonial Secretary of British Guiana, a post he held until 1922. From there he was named the Colonial Secretary of Ceylon, where he served until 1925. Each position imparted considerable responsibility, and on more than one occasion he was in charge of administering the entire government of his area of responsibility. Whilst in Ceylon he served as President of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1924. ==Governor of Hong Kong== In 1925, Clementi was appointed as Governor of Hong Kong, a position to which his fluency in Cantonese suited him well and in which he served until 1930. During his tenure, the Canton–Hong Kong strike, which crippled the Hong Kong economy, was resolved and Kai Tak Airport entered operation (it would operate until Hong Kong International Airport opened and took over as the main airport in 1998). He also notably ended the practice of Mui Tsai, the traditional Chinese \\"female maid servitude\\" system which often resulted in the abuse of young servant girls. He also appointed Shouson Chow, a prominent Chinese merchant, as the first unofficial member of the Executive Council. At the same time, he increased the numbers of official and non-official (\\"Unofficial\\") members in the Legislative Council from eight to ten (including the Governor) and from six to eight, respectively. He invited one Chinese and one Portuguese (Jose Pedro Braga) to be Unofficials. ==Governorship of the Straits Settlements== Sir Cecil, as the Governor of Straits Settlements After his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong ended, Clementi went on to serve his last post in the Colonial Services as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements, which included Singapore, and High Commissioner for the Malay States, from 5 February 1930 to 17 February 1934. He handed over to Sir Andrew Caldecott, who become acting Governor, and left for England due to his illness. The position of Governor was later filled by Sir Shenton Thomas on 9 November 1934. Six years later, in 1940, Clementi became the Master of the Mercers' Company. ==Personal life== Clementi was the nephew of the Rt. Hon. Sir Cecil Clementi Smith (1860–1916), Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner in the period 1887 to 1893. He was also the great-grandson of the Italian-born musician Muzio Clementi. Clementi married Marie Penelope Rose Eyres, daughter of Admiral Cresswell John Eyres, in 1912. The couple had one son, Cresswell, and three daughters. Clementi died in High Wycombe, England, on 5 April 1947. ==Honours== *C.M.G., 1916 *K.C.M.G., 1926 *G.C.M.G., 1931 *K.St.J., 1926 *Fellow, Royal Geographical Society (F.R.G.S.) *Member, Royal Asiatic Society (M.R.A.S.) *Honorary Fellow, Magdalen College, Oxford, 1938 *Recipient, Cuthbert Peek award of the Royal Geographical Society, 1912 *Honours LL.D. degree, Hong Kong University, 1925 ==Publications== *Cantonese Love Songs.

In psychic driving, patients were often exposed to hundreds of thousands of repetitions of a single statement over the course of their treatment. They were also concurrently administered muscular paralytic drugs such as curare to subdue them for the purposes of exposure to the looped message(s). The procedure was pioneered by Dr. D. Ewen Cameron, and used and funded by the CIA's Project MKUltra program in Canada. ==Psychiatry and MKUltra== The psychic driving procedure was a chronological precursor to Cameron's depatterning, the latter involving massive doses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with similarly large doses of psychedelic drugs (such as LSD). The intent was to break down the subject's personality—theoretically psychic driving could then be used with some efficacy in establishing a new personality. In Cameron's depatterning, the ECT would often continue to be administered despite the manifestation of convulsive fits, which were consensually considered to be contraindications to normal and safe ECT procedure. Such biologically and psychologically devastating procedures, adopted internationally by the psychiatric establishment, were largely abolished by the time the CIA was brought before a Senate Hearing (1977)Transcript of the 1977 Senate Hearing can be found here , here or here for its involvement and funding of Cameron's experimental activities--as part of the MKULTRA program.For information on the 1977 Court Action against the CIA see: The topic of Cameron's psychic driving is dealt with in some detail in the docudrama entitled The Sleep Room (1998) directed by Anne Wheeler. ==Other uses== Similar techniques are alleged to have been used in the kidnapping and death of CIA operative William Francis Buckley by Aziz al-Abub, a medical doctor from Beirut who was seen as epitomizing medical torture. Aziz al-Abub, also known as Ibrahim al-Nadhir, was known for using his medical training to refine torture techniques. His techniques were shown to be closely connected to the CIA-developed torture techniques. As with the CIA, he used drugs to make it easier to handle those he tortured, carefully determined how long to keep a prisoner hooded and when to isolate them and other techniques seen as medical torture. ==In popular culture== Initially, in the hit NBC TV series Hannibal, Dr. Chilton uses psychic driving on a patient of the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Abel Gideon (played by Eddie Izzard), to convince him that he is the main antagonist of the series, the Chesapeake ripper. Later in the series psychic driving is alluded to by the main character Dr. Hannibal Lecter as a means to convince FBI profiler Will Graham that he has committed a string of brutal murders during a bout of encephalitis, to throw him off the trail and keep himself safe. Dr. Lecter uses psychic driving by purposely inducing trance-like states during therapy session, using Will Graham's encephalitis, then reinforcing his delusions that he has killed during episodes of lost time where he can't remember his own actions. ==See also== *Donald Ewen Cameron *Project MKUltra *The Men Who Stare At Goats *William Sargant ==Books== * * ==References== Category:1953 establishments in the United States Category:Central Intelligence Agency operations Category:Devices to alter consciousness Category:History of the United States government Category:Human subject research in psychiatry Category:Human subject research in the United States Category:Investigations and hearings of the United States Congress Category:Lysergic acid diethylamide Category:Military history of the United States Category:Military psychiatry Category:Mind control Category:Psychedelic drug research Category:Secret government programs Category:Torture in the United States ","title":"Psychic driving"},{"id":"1999560","text":"Brigitte Zypries (born 16 November 1953) is a German lawyer and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Between 2017 and 2018, she served as Minister for Economics and Energy in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel; she was the first woman to hold that office in German history. Zypries had previously been Parliamentary State Secretary since December 2013, charged with the coordination of Germany's aviation and space policies. She was Federal Minister of Justice of Germany from 2002 to 2009 and State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior from 1998 to 2002. == Early life and education == Zypries studied law at the University of Giessen from 1972 to 1977, and took her first legal state exam in 1978. Then followed in-service training in the regional court district of Gießen, and in 1980 the second state exam. Until 1985 she worked at the University of Giessen. == Career  Early career === * 1985–1988: Assistant head of division at State Chancellery of Hesse * 1988–1990: Member of academic staff at the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany * 1991: Head of division of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony * 1995–1997: Head of department of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony * to 1998: Active in the Ministry for Women, Labour and Social Affairs of Lower Saxony === State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior, 1998-2002=== Following the 1998 federal elections, in the first cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Zypries became State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior under Otto Schily. From September 1999, she chaired the State Secretary Committee for the management of the Federal Government program \\"Modern State – Modern Administration\\". === Federal Minister of Justice, 2002 – 2009 === Following the 2002 federal elections, Zypries became Federal Minister of Justice in the second cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, succeeding Herta Däubler-Gmelin. Between 2007 and 2009, she was also one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state (Föderalismuskommission II), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany. In 2003, Zypries represented the German government before the Federal Constitutional Court when the Free Democratic Party challenged a German law allowing authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes. While law-enforcement officials and the government argue that the law helps fight organized crime and terrorism, opponents contend it violates constitutional privacy guarantees and has not allowed authorities to crack a single major case.Top German Court Hears a Challenge To Eavesdropping The New York Times, July 2, 2003. In 2005, the German government suffered a major setback in its efforts to combat terrorism after the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the country's implementation of the European Arrest Warrant was unconstitutional. The court said the EU idea was compatible with Germany's constitution, but that the law drafted by Zypries was sloppily written and did not go far enough in framing the leeway offered to prosecutors by the European Arrest Warrant.German Papers: Germany Released al-Qaida Terror Suspect Spiegel Online, July 19, 2005. Just hours after the ruling, German police released terrorism suspect Mamoun Darkazanli, who had been held awaiting extradition to Spain where he is believed to have been linked to al- Qaida activities.German Papers: Germany Released al-Qaida Terror Suspect Spiegel Online, July 19, 2005. When German economics minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg decided to outsource the drafting of new bankruptcy legislation in 2009, Zypries criticized that Guttenberg wasted taxpayers’ money and that it was the responsibility of her ministry, not his, to oversee the preparation of the legislation.Judy Dempsey (August 26, 2009), In Dull German Race, ’08 Dinner Is an Issue The New York Times. In 2010, the Constitutional Court ruled that a law requiring telecommunications companies to retain data from telephone, email and Internet traffic is unconstitutional; the law had been introduced by Zypries as implementation of an EU guideline.Taking on the Internet Giants: Germany Applies Brakes to Google & Co. Spiegel Online, March 11, 2010. In the negotiations to form a government following the 2005 federal elections, Zypries led the SPD's delegations in the working groups on justice, consumer protection, and internal affairs; her co-chairs from the CDU/CSU were Wolfgang Bosbach, Horst Seehofer and Wolfgang Schäuble, respectively.Timot Szent-Ivanyi (October 25, 2005), Gutverdiener sollen höhere Kassenbeiträge zahlen Berliner Zeitung. After German prosecutors had issued arrest warrants in 2007 for 13 suspected CIA operatives believed to have been involved in the abduction of Khaled el-Masri in Macedonia in late 2003 as well as in his being taken via Baghdad to a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan in January 2004, Zypries soon decided not to further pursue the CIA agents. Though their names were still on an Interpol wanted persons list, the United States stated that it would not recognize its validity. Zypries explained that the US government had made clear to her that it would neither arrest nor hand over the agents. In the end, she concluded that, given the slim chances of success, it made no sense to even try to get them extradited.Matthias Gebauer and John Goetz (December 9, 2010), The CIA's El-Masri Abduction: Cables Show Germany Caved to Pressure from Washington Der Spiegel.

In the case of Richard Williamson in 2009, Zypries said that the German government was willing to press charges against the bishop if he did not clearly retract his comments.Rachel Donadio (February 27, 2009), Vatican Calls the Apology of a Bishop Insufficient The New York Times. In 2009, Zypries led the resistance to the Google Books Library Project in Germany. In the daily Stuttgarter Nachrichten, she accused Google of behaving in a \\"simply unlawful\\" way.Digital Library Controversy: Google Gives Ground at EU Hearing Spiegel Online, September 8, 2009. === Member of Parliament, 2009 – 2017 === Between 2009 and 2013, Zypries served on the German Bundestag’s Committee on the Election of Judges (Wahlausschuss), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. From 2009, she was also a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG). Ahead of the 2013 elections, Peer Steinbrück included Zypries in his shadow cabinet for the Social Democrats’ campaign to unseat incumbent Angela Merkel as chancellor. During the campaign, Zypries served as shadow minister for consumer protection. In the negotiations to form a so-called Grand Coalition following the elections, she led the SPD delegation in the working group on digital policy; her co-chair was Dorothee Bär of the CSU. Following the formation of the grand coalition in December 2013, Zypries was appointed Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. In January 2014, she became the government's coordinator for aviation and space policies. In February 2014, Zypries accompanied German President Joachim Gauck on a state visit to India – where they met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, among others – and Myanmar.Anne Merholz (February 5, 2014), Großes Staatsbankett für Gauck Bild. In June 2016, Zypries announced that she would not stand in the 2017 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.Zypries tritt nicht mehr an Frankfurter Rundschau, June 5, 2016. ===Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, 2017 – 2018=== In a cabinet reshuffle following the nomination of Frank-Walter Steinmeier as candidate for the federal presidency, Zypries was appointed Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy on 27 January 2017. She succeeded Sigmar Gabriel, who took the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs from Steinmeier.

When the company filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2017, she authorized a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations with Lufthansa continue.Madeline Chambers and Joseph Nasr (August 15, 2017), Germany provides 150 million euro bridging loan to insolvent Air Berlin Reuters.

He became a frequent substitute of the show's host, Art Bell in late 1999, and when Bell announced his retirement in early 2000, he recommended Siegel to succeed him. Siegel maintained the format of the show that Art Bell had created, but his personal style was very different, and the show became less popular. Early in 2001, Bell decided to return, and Siegel left the show. Siegel hosted the show from Seattle, Washington, where he lived. Later, Siegel hosted a daily talk show on WLIE, in Islip, Long Island. During this tenure, he promoted the movement to make Long Island the 51st state (with himself as its first Governor), and advocated \\"smoke-ins\\" to protest the county's smoking ban.

It was perhaps the crown most associated with the queen and is one of the Crown Jewels on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. ==Background== Following the death of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Victoria's husband, in 1861, Queen Victoria withdrew from public life and wore a black and white ensemble colloquially known as widow's weeds, which she continued to wear until her death in 1901. Under government pressure she came back into public view in 1870. However, she declined to wear her Imperial State Crown again, partly because she found it heavy and uncomfortable to wear, and partly because it would have been impossible to wear on top of her widow's cap. The new small crown was created as a substitute, meeting both the ceremonial duties of a monarch and her own desired form of dress as a widow. It was manufactured in March 1870 by the Crown Jewellers, Garrard & Co. ==Design== Although diminutive, the silver crown follows the standard design for British crowns. It is made up of two arches joining at a monde surmounted by a cross. Each of the arches runs from a cross pattée along the rim of the base. Between each cross pattée is a fleur-de-lis. Because of its small size – across and high – the crown possesses no internal cap. It contains 1,162 brilliant and 138 rose-cut diamonds weighing that were taken from a large necklace belonging to the queen. Unlike coloured gemstones, diamonds were seen as acceptable to wear in mourning. The crown weighs in total. ==Usage== Queen Victoria first used her new crown at the State Opening of Parliament on 9 February 1871. She often wore it minus the arches as a circlet or open crown. ==After Victoria== The crown had belonged to Queen Victoria personally rather than to the Crown and thus was not a part of the Crown Jewels. Victoria left it to the Crown in her will. It was subsequently worn on occasions by the queen consort, Alexandra of Denmark (1901–10) and after her by the next queen consort, Mary of Teck (1910–36). After the death of Mary's husband, George V, she stopped wearing the crown. When the new queen consort, Elizabeth Bowes- Lyon (1936–52), decided not to wear the Small Diamond Crown, it was deposited by the Queen Victoria's great-grandson, George VI, in the Jewel House at the Tower of London, where it remains on public display. ==References== Category:Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom Category:Individual crowns Category:Queen Victoria Category:1870 introductions Category:1870 in the United Kingdom ","title":"Small Diamond Crown of Queen Victoria"},{"id":"1999596","text":"Manfred Stolpe in 2015 Manfred Stolpe (16 May 1936 – 29 December 2019) was Federal Minister of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs of Germany from 2002 until 2005.

A concept album was released in Australia in 1990 with the first stage production taking place in Sydney in 2003. According to English, the concept for the musical began in a 1982 prank: he wrote a song called \\"Oh Paris\\", about the mythic hero rather than the French capital, just to see how many people actually listened to the words. The musical focuses on the love story between Helen and Paris as it follows his participation in the Trojan War. Paris is about the struggle to maintain some balance between passion and order, law and chaos, head and heart. ==Concept album== In 1987 Jon English took on the role of the mad monk Rasputin in the stage musical of the same name. This production, although controversial at the time, served to fire Jon’s ambition to write his own show based on the Trojan War. English travelled to England to again work with David Mackay who had produced his album Some People... (1983). For three years, English and Mackay worked on the musical, with English stopping to star in the Sydney production of the musical Big River in 1988 and to release his studio album, The Busker (1990). The musical was preceded in 1990 by a 2-CD concept album, called Paris: A Love Story, recorded in London. English sang the role of Hector, and the cast included John Parr as Paris, Sheila Parker as Helen, Terence Donovan as Priam, Sheryl Parker as Cassandra, Doc Neeson as Achilles, John Waters as Agamemnon, Philip Quast as Patroclus, Joe Fagin as Menelaus, as well as Demis Roussos, David Atkins and Barry Humphries, backed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Choir.Paris at The Philip Quast Guide, accessed 4 June 2009 At the ARIA Music Awards of 1991, the album was nominated for two ARIA Awards, winning Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album.

King Priam of Troy prays for guidance from the goddesses Aphrodite and Athena. Cassandra and Laocoen lament over the poor decision that Priam is about to make. She tries to warn her father (\\"Head Without a Heart\\"). Priam ignores her and sends Paris to the Greek province of Sparta as an emissary to foster goodwill (\\"What Could Go Wrong?\\"). Paris and Aeneas sail to Sparta, but the boat is wrecked in a storm and Paris falls overboard. Helen, the wife of King Menalaus of Sparta, finds Paris washed up on shore and nurses him (\\"Perfect Stranger\\"). He mistakes her for Aphrodite, falling in love at first sight. Helen wishes she could leave her life behind. Paris stumbles upon Sinon, Thersites and Talbythius, who escort him to the palace to meet the Greek kings. Agamemnon and Menelaus try to convince the other Greek kings to invade Troy, but to no avail. Achilles barges in on the meeting and asks how Agamemnon thought it would be possible to take Troy without him leading the army. When Paris arrives, the Greek nobles are fighting about business (\\"Business\\"). They make fun of their bedraggled visitor, and Agamemnon thinks up a plan to exploit the Trojan prince for information. Helen tries to convince Paris that he has fallen into a trap, but ends up falling in love with him, and they escape together. They discuss that they can never be together, as they both have duties to their people. However, a guard finds them and tries to kill Paris, but Helen saves his life by stabbing the guard in the back. Helen's old friend, the fisherman, tells them to escape. When Agamemnon appears, he kills both the fisherman and Helen's handmaiden, framing Paris for the crime. Menelaus reflects on his love for Helen. He will never rest until he has her back. This convinces the other kings to follow him and attack Troy. Paris sings to Helen about how fate has brought them together (\\"Trust in Your Heart\\"). Paris and Helen arrive at Troy, facing the judgement of his entire family for provoking the Greek kings and potentially starting a war. Paris stands up to his father, telling him that he will be with Helen, \\"Come Hell or High Water\\". This sparks a bad reaction in the crowd, who start hurling insults at the two lovers, and not even the rebuttal of Paris' older brother, the heroic Hector, can stop their anger. A war is imminent. ;Act II On the ramparts in Troy, Hector rallies the Trojan army, leading them into battle against the invading Greeks (\\"No Turning Back\\"). Paris and Helen sing about their love and commitment as a ten-year war begins, and countless soldiers die around them (\\"For Better or For Worse\\"). Achilles confronts Agamemnon about his selfish attitude and how he claims all the spoils of war for himself (\\"What Price a Friend\\"). He throws down his armour, saying that he won't continue to fight for Agamemnon. The Trojans launch an assault on the Greek camp, and with Achilles gone it seems all of their hope is lost. Patroclus dons his friend's armour and leading the Greeks under the guise of their immortal champion. Hector slays Patroclus, and Achilles laments the death of his only friend before challenging Hector to a duel. Against the wishes of his entire family, Hector prepares to face Achilles, believing that he has a chance to end the war once and for all. Hector bids farewell to his family and marches out to fight Achilles. Achilles and Hector engage in an epic duel. Hector is the better swordsman, but he cannot penetrate the armour of the immortal warrior, who relies on brute force. Hector kicks Achilles in his one weak point, his heel, and drives him to the ground, where he frantically slashes at his foe, but is still unable to harm him. Desperately, Achilles, strikes up at Hector, impaling him. As Achilles ties the body of his fallen adversary to his chariot, Paris shoots an arrow at him from the walls of Troy, hitting him in the heel and killing him. Paris mourns his deceased brother as the two leaders are carried off for their funerals. Ulysses, disguised as a beggar, confronts Helen, asking her if she knows any way to end the war. She has no answers for him. Ulysses prays to Athena, asking her for a way to end the war. He gets a response from the goddess and constructs the legendary Trojan Horse, realising that the only way out is a head without a heart (\\"The Horse with no Rider\\"). Agamemnon 'volunteers' Sinon as a stooge in order to convince the Trojans to bring the horse inside the city. The Trojans find the horse and Sinon, who convinces Priam to take it into the city. Cassandra laments that Paris should have known better, as Thersites and Talbythius sneak out of the horse and open the gates of Troy, letting the Greek army in. A rout ensues. Paris and Aeneas try to gather up the royal family and escape the city, but find that Priam has already been murdered. They gather a small group of survivors and attempt to escape, but Menelaus finds them and shoots an arrow into Paris' back, still believing him to have abducted Helen against her will. However, as Paris dies in his lover's arms (\\"Oh, Paris\\"), Menalaus finally realises that Helen truly loved him and attempts to console her amidst the burning wreckage of Troy (\\"Love Has Power\\"). ==Musical numbers== As recorded in 1990, re-released in 2003 with new songs.Paris synopsis (liner notes), record listing allthingsquast.info, accessed June 5, 2009 ;Act I * \\"Overture * \\"Prelude * \\"Head without a Heart\\" – Cassandra and Laocoen * \\"Straight Ahead\\" – Paris * \\"What Could Go Wrong\\" – Paris and Aeneas * \\"Perfect Stranger\\" – Helen and Paris * \\"A Long Time Coming\\" – Helen * \\"Far Too Many Kings\\" – Sinon, Thersites, Talthybius * \\"Business\\" – Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ulysses, Patroclus and Ajax * \\"The Leader\\" – Achilles * \\"Paris in Court\\" – Paris, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ulysses, Sinon, Patroclus & Achilles * \\"Any Fool Could See\\" – Helen, Paris, Menelaus and Agamemnon * \\"The Cliffs\\" – Helen and Paris * \\"A Thief In The Night\\" – Menelaus * \\"Thoughts of Love\\" – Paris * \\"Trust in Your Heart\\" – Paris * \\"Welcome Home\\" – Ensemble * \\"Hell or High Water\\" – Paris and Helen ; Act II * \\"No Turning Back\\" – Hector * \\"For Better Or Worse\\" – Paris and Helen * \\"Ten Years On\\" – Instrumental * \\"The Greek Camp\\" – Achilles, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Patroclus & Menelaus * \\"What Price A Friend\\" – Patroclus * \\"Now I Truly Know\\" – Hector * \\"Battle Lines\\" – Hector * \\"Love Has Power\\" – Hector * \\"Two Titans\\" – Paris and Achilles * \\"A Royal Trojan Son\\" – Paris * \\"The Beggar\\" – Ulysses and Helen * \\"Ulysses Prayer\\" – Ulysses * \\"Horse With No Rider\\" – Ulysses and Agamemnon * \\"Inside Outside\\" – Sinon, Thersites and Talthybius * \\"The Balance Shifts\\" – Sinon, Priam * \\"Oh Paris\\" – Helen & Ulysses * \\"Finale\\" – Company ;Notes * new to 2003 score. * new to 2008 score. ==See also== *Paris (1928 musical) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Paris Music Placeholder for original recording and other information *Paris information at Spicer *Slavin, John.

The show's opening and ending theme songs (\\"Soldier in the Space\\" and \\"The Drifting Galaxy\\", respectively) were performed by the Japanese hard rock group Bow Wow, while Kazutaka Tazaki (of The Bach Revolution) and Nakayuki Sakuraba (of Adbaloon) provided additional music for the show. The puppets of X-Bomber were controlled from below the set using rods, and as a consequence were generally seen only from the waist up. Whereas Gerry Anderson's series were episodic in nature, X-Bomber had an overall story arc, with sub-plots and new characters being introduced as the series progressed, leading to a definite end. Similarly, rod puppets were used in Gerry Anderson's 1967 series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons canned as \\"under-control\\" puppets due to their inability to walk-whereas everywhere else they were marionettes. Anderson would later use Rod puppets in Terrahawks. ==Star Fleet== X-Bomber was renamed Star Fleet and dubbed by English speaking actors for broadcast in the United Kingdom on ITV. The show was broadcast there on Saturday mornings, first airing on ,TV Times Magazine, page 38, 23-29th October 1982 the day before Star Wars aired for the first time on British television. Due to its broadcast slot, the advertisements shown before, during and after each episode frequently included children's Public Information Films. The series was also broadcast as such on first-run syndication in the United States. Drawing heavily on diverse influences such as Star Wars, Japanese Anime and Gerry Anderson's various \\"Supermarionation\\" series, the show ran for twenty-four half-hour episodes (twenty-five in Japan - the eighteenth episode, titled Bloody Mary's Promotion, was not included in the English version, as it consisted mainly of flashbacks). The English version's theme song was composed by Paul Bliss, and was later covered by Queen member Brian May and Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen. This was released under the name \\"Star Fleet Project\\". The screenplay was adapted for English by Michael Sloan, who in later years would create the popular TV series The Master and The Equalizer. Actress Denise Bryer (\\"Commander Makara\\") and editor Tony Lenny both went on to collaborate with Gerry Anderson and Christopher Burr making another memorable sci-fi series, Terrahawks. ==Plot outline== The year is 2999 and the Earth is at peace following the Space Wars. The safety of the human race is ensured by Earth Defense Force (EDF). Shortly before the turn of the fourth millennium, the peace is broken by the appearance of a gigantic alien battle cruiser. Powerless to defend itself, the EDF's Pluto base is completely destroyed and the evil Commander Makara reveals that the same fate awaits the Earth unless the mysterious F-Zero-One is handed over to her. Unaware of the nature of F-Zero-One and fearing retribution, the EDF presses into action an untested, incomplete weapon, codenamed X-Project, from its hidden moon-base. The X-Project is revealed to be a powerfully-armed spacecraft named X-Bomber. The series then follows the adventures of the crew of the X-Bomber, namely Doctor Benn, Shiro Hagen, Barry Hercules and John Lee who are joined by PPA, Lamia and her guardian Kirara. They set off to discover the nature of the F-Zero-One and try to protect it from the increasingly desperate Commander Makara and her menacing overlord, the Imperial Master. Eventually it is revealed that Lamia herself is the mysterious F-Zero-One, a powerful alien destined to bring peace to the galaxy at the turn of the millennium. The series continues with Lamia gradually discovering her true nature and powers while the Imperial Alliance attempts to capture her and destroy the X-Bomber. The series climaxes with the X-Bomber crew destroying Commander Makara and Lamia finally confronting and defeating the Imperial Master and bringing peace to the universe. ==Episodes== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !

One was drawn by Naoki Kamohara and published in the magazine Monthly Shōnen Jump by Shueisha from to and the other was drawn by Makoto Ono in the magazine TV-kun by Shogakukan from to . British comic magazine Look-In ran strips based on Star Fleet for 32 weeks beginning in January 1983. ==Home video== The original Japanese version of the series was released in its entirety in a LD-box in 1993 and by Pioneer LDC in a DVD-box set in . Both sets also contained one of two compilation movies created from Star Fleet, in English with Japanese subtitles. Both sets have since gone out of print. On April 24, 2013, Bandai Visual released a Remastered DVD-Box of the series featuring enhanced and remastered scenes. In Bulgaria The Thalian Space Wars and Space Quest For F-01 tapes were released by Multi Video Center with Bulgarian dub. In the US, eight video tapes were released which also contained compilations of the series' episodes, albeit in a less-drastically edited format. It is possible to obtain VCD copies on eBay. These are usually taken from the American Tapes and tend to be of poor quality. In the UK, only three Star Fleet video tapes were ever released. The first and rarest contained episodes 4 and 5 of the series. The other two were compilation movies entitled The Thalian Space Wars and Space Quest For F-01. The series has not been repeated on UK television since the late 1980s. A DVD set of Star Fleet was released in the UK on by Fabulous Films. Included in the DVD set are all 24 episodes, remastered, and restored to their original UK broadcast format. Beyond the episodes, the set also includes stills and a double-sided poster, as well as a comicbook and a comprehensive 'making of' documentary, which includes contributions from series creator Go Nagai, Dr Benn voice artist Peter Marinker, Brian May, Paul Bliss and Gerry Anderson. As a result of this release, several videos have been removed from YouTube. X-Bomber The Game, the freeware fan project, was issued with a request to remove the game from its website. Further to the DVD release, Paul Bliss' soundtrack has been released on CD and is available via mail order. Discotek Media announced in June 2016 that they will release the dubbed series on DVD in the United States on December 20, 2016. It was later delayed for a February 2017 release. They later announced in January 2019 that they will release both that version and the original version on SD Blu-ray in the United States on March 26, 2019. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *SFXB: Star Fleet / X-Bomber Homepage *X-Bomber Game Project *F-Zero-One: Star Fleet / X-Bomber site * Fabulous Films-the distributors site *X Bomber at allcinema *X Bomber at the World of Go Nagai webpage * Category:1980 Japanese television series debuts Category:1981 Japanese television series endings Category:Discotek Media Category:English-language television shows Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Go Nagai Category:ITV children's television shows Category:Shōnen manga Category:Space adventure television series Category:Super robot anime and manga Category:Japanese television shows featuring puppetry Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television series set in the future Category:Tokusatsu television series ","title":"X-Bomber"},{"id":"1999621","text":"Styrax (common names storax or snowbell) is a genus of about 130 species of large shrubs or small trees in the family Styracaceae, mostly native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority in eastern and southeastern Asia, but also crossing the equator in South America.Fritsch et al. (2001) The resin obtained from the tree is called benzoin or storax (not to be confused with the Liquidambar storax balsam). The genus Pamphilia, sometimes regarded as distinct, is now included within Styrax based on analysis of morphological and DNA sequence data.Wallnöfer (1997), Fritsch et al. (2001) The spicebush (Lindera benzoin) is a different plant, in the family Lauraceae. Styrax trees grow to 2–14 m tall, and have alternate, deciduous or evergreen simple ovate leaves 1–18 cm long and 2–10 cm broad. The flowers are pendulous, with a white 5–10-lobed corolla, produced 3–30 together on open or dense panicles 5–25 cm long. The fruit is an oblong dry drupe, smooth and lacking ribs or narrow wings, unlike the fruit of the related snowdrop trees (Halesia) and epaulette trees (Pterostyrax). ==UsesUses of resin=== Benzoin resin, a dried exudation from pierced bark, is currently produced from various Styrax species native to Sumatra, Java, and Thailand. Commonly traded are the resins of S. tonkinensis (Siam benzoin), S. benzoin (Sumatra benzoin), and S. benzoides. The name benzoin is probably derived from Arabic lubān jāwī (لبان جاوي, \\"Javan frankincense); compare the obsolete terms gum benjamin and benjoin. This incidentally shows that the Arabs were aware of the origin of these resins, and that by the late Middle Ages at latest international trade in them was probably of major importance. The chemical benzoin (2-Hydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone), despite the apparent similarity of the name, is not contained in benzoin resin in measurable quantities. However, benzoin resin does contain small amounts of the hydrocarbon styrene, named however for Levant storax (from Liquidambar orientalis), from which it was first isolated, and not for the genus Styrax itself; industrially produced styrene is now used to produce polystyrene plastics, including Styrofoam. ====History of sources==== Styrax officinalis resin was mainly used in antiquity Since Antiquity, storax resin has been used in perfumes, certain types of incense, and medicines. There is some degree of uncertainty as to exactly what resin old sources refer to. Turkish sweetgum (Liquidambar orientalis) is a quite unrelated tree in the family Altingiaceae that produces a similar resin traded in modern times as storax or as Levant storax, like the resins of other sweetgums, and a number of confusing variations thereupon. Turkish sweetgum is a relict species that occurs only in a small area in SW Turkey (and not in the Levant at all); presumably, quite some of the \\"storax resin\\" of the Ancient Greek and the Ancient Roman sources was from this sweetgum, rather than a Styrax, although at least during the former era genuine Styrax resin, probably from S. officinalis, was imported in quantity from the Near East by Phoenician merchants, and Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BC indicates that different kinds of storax were traded.Herodotus of Halicarnassus (c.440 BC) III.107.2 The nataf (נטף) of the incense sacred to Yahweh, mentioned in the Book of Exodus, is loosely translated by the Greek term staktē (στακτή, AMP: ), or an unspecific \\"gum resin\\" or similar term (NIV: ). Nataf may have meant the resin of Styrax officinalis or of some other plant, perhaps Turkish sweetgum, which is unlikely to have been imported in quantity into the Near East. Since the Middle Ages, Southeast Asian benzoin resins became increasingly available; today there is little international trade in S. officinalis resin and little production of Turkish sweetgum resin due to that species' decline in numbers. ====Use as incense==== Storax incense is used in the Middle East and adjacent regions as an air freshener. This was adopted in the European Papier d'Arménie. Though highly toxic benzene and formaldehyde are produced when burning Styrax incense (as with almost all organic substances), the amounts produced by burning a strip of Papier d'Arménie every 2–3 days are less than those achieved by many synthetic air fresheners. Storax resin from southern Arabian species was burned during frankincense (Boswellia resin) harvesting; it was said to drive away snakes: > \\"[The Arabians] gather frankincense by burning that storax which Phoenicians > carry to Hellas; they burn this and so get the frankincense; for the spice- > bearing trees are guarded by small winged snakes of varied color, many > around each tree; these are the snakes that attack Egypt.Although Herodotus > saw bones of many of \\"these [...] snakes\\", their having wings is hearsay > information and either incorrect or refers to some kind of agama with neck > or body ornaments. See Herodotus of Halicarnassus (c.440 BC) II.75.1-4. > Nothing except the smoke of storax will drive them away from the > trees.\\"Herodotus of Halicarnassus (c.440 BC) III.107.2: > >> ton men ge libanôton sullegousi tên sturaka thumiôntes, tên es Hellênas Phoinikes exagousi: tautên thumiôntes lambanousi: ta gar dendrea tauta ta libanôtophora ophies hupopteroi, mikroi ta megathea, poikiloi ta eidea, phulassousi plêtheï polloi peri dendron hekaston, houtoi hoi per ep' Aigupton epistrateuontai, oudeni de allôi apelaunontai apo tôn dendreôn ê tês sturakos tôi kapnôi. Gum benjamin (Styrax benzoin) parts drawing. Franz Eugen Köhler: Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen in naturgetreuen Abbildungen, etc. (1887) ====Medical uses==== There has been little dedicated research into the medical properties of storax resin, but it has been used for long, and apparently with favorable results. It was important in Islamic medicine; Avicenna (Ibn Seena, ابن سینا) discusses S. officinalis it in his Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb (القانون في الطب, The Law of Medicine). He indicates that storax resin mixed with other antibiotic substances and hardening material gives a good dental restorative material. Benzoin resin is a component of the \\"Theriaca Andromachi Senioris\\", a Venice treacle recipe in the 1686 d'Amsterdammer Apotheek. Tincture of benzoin is benzoin resin dissolved in alcohol. This and its numerous derived versions like lait virginal and friar's balsam were highly esteemed in 19th-century European cosmetics and other household purposes; they apparently had antibacterial properties. Today tincture of benzoin is most often used in first aid for small injuries, as it acts as a disinfectant and local anesthetic and seems to promote healing. Benzoin resin and its derivatives are also used as additives in cigarettes. The antibiotic activity of benzoin resin seems mostly due to its abundant benzoic acid and benzoic acid esters, which were named after the resin; other less well known secondary compounds such as lignans like pinoresinol are likely significant too.Pastrorova et al. (1997) ===Horticultural uses=== Early summer blossoms of Styrax japonicus Several species of storax are popular ornamental trees in parks and gardens, especially S. japonicus and its cultivars such as 'Emerald Pagoda', and Styrax obassia. ===Uses of wood=== The wood of larger species is suitable for fine handicrafts. That of egonoki (エゴノキ, S. japonicus) is used to build kokyū (胡弓), the Japanese bowed instrument. ==Ecology and conservation== The resin of Styrax acts to kill wound pathogens and deter herbivores. Consequently, for example, few Lepidoptera caterpillars eat storax compared to other plants. Those of the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator) were recorded on S. argenteus, but they do not seem to use it on a regular basis.Hébert et al. (2004), Brower et al. (2006) Some storax species have declined in numbers due to unsustainable logging and habitat degradation. While most of these are classified as vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN, only four trees of the nearly extinct palo de jazmin (S. portoricensis) are known to survive at a single location. Although legally protected, this species could be wiped out by a single hurricane. ==Selected species== Styrax camporum parts drawing.

The show was set in fictional Bellefield, ostensibly a play on the combination of Belleville and Bloomfield, two adjacent older working class suburbs on the north side of Newark, New Jersey. In the first season, Frank DeLucca works as a toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike, while Dolly is a housewife. In the second season, Frank retires after suffering a heart attack on the job, and he and Dolly open a restaurant. Kevin Dillon played Paulie, Lydia's younger brother who was a young officer on the Bellefield Police Department who still lived at home. Debi Mazar played Jackie, Lydia's wise-cracking friend who owned a hair salon. The show mixed family situations with situations focusing on Lydia's life as a young single woman looking for both love and stable career, and for more out of life than simply raising children. The first season revolved around the fallout from Lydia's breaking off her engagement to Lou (Sonny Marinelli, who was written out after a few episodes), enrolling at a local university somewhat resembling nearby Montclair State University, and moving away from home for the first time. Most of the situations were light- hearted, but plots occasionally delved into darker subjects, including Paulie's struggle to resist the temptation to fall into corruption as a police officer. In the second season, Lydia finally selects a major to pursue a career in sports medicine. Her mother Dolly successfully ran for city council of Bellefield. Paulie started dating Plum (Danielle Harris), a classmate whom Lydia befriends in the first season, and marries her. The show developed a small fan base and received generally positive critical response, but languished in the ratings, despite the presence of well-known names in its cast, in part because it aired during the Friday night death slot for much of its run. It was cancelled at the end of the second season with numerous unresolved plot lines, including the budding romance between Lydia and one of her professors. ==Cast== *Heather Paige Kent as Lydia DeLucca *Debi Mazar as Jackie O'Grady *Ellen Burstyn as Dolly DeLucca *Paul Sorvino as Frank DeLucca *Kevin Dillon as Paulie DeLucca *Danielle Harris as Plum Wilkinson (later: DeLucca) *Gregory Jbara as Jo Jo Regosi ==EpisodesSeason 1 (2000–01)=== {| class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" |- ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| No. overall ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| No. in season ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Original air date |} ===Season 2 (2001–02)=== {| class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" |- ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| No. overall ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| No. in season ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\"| Original air date |} ==TV ratings== *Highest rated: 12.1 million/9.1 household rating [series debut against Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony] *2000 to 2001: *2001 to 2002: 6.9 million viewers ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !

It is used in perfumes, some kinds of incense, as a flavoring, and medicine (see tincture of benzoin). It is distinct from the chemical compound benzoin, which is ultimately derived from benzoin resin; the resin, however, does not contain this compound. Benzoin is sometimes called gum benzoin or gum benjamin, and in India Sambrani or loban, though loban is, via Arabic lubān, a generic term for frankincense-type incense, e.g., fragrant tree resin. Benzoin is also called storax, not to be confused with the balsam of the same name obtained from the Hamamelidaceae family. Benzoin is a common ingredient in incense-making and perfumery because of its sweet vanilla-like aroma and fixative properties. Gum benzoin is a major component of the type of church incense used in Russia and some other Orthodox Christian societies, as well as Western Catholic Churches.St. Alban Blend Most benzoin is used in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and India, where it is burned on charcoal as an incense. It is also used in the production of Bakhoor (Arabic بخور - scented wood chips) as well as various mixed resin incense in the Arab countries and the Horn of Africa. Benzoin is also used in blended types of Japanese incense, Indian incense, Chinese incense (known as Anxi xiang; 安息香), and Papier d'Arménie as well as incense sticks. There are two common kinds of benzoin, benzoin Siam and benzoin Sumatra. Benzoin Siam is obtained from Styrax tonkinensis, found across Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Benzoin Sumatra is obtained from Styrax benzoin, which grows predominantly on the island of Sumatra. Unlike Siamese benzoin, Sumatran benzoin contains cinnamic acid in addition to benzoic acid. In the United States, Sumatra benzoin (Styrax benzoin and Styrax paralleoneurus) is more customarily used in pharmaceutical preparations, Siam benzoin (Styrax tonkinensis et al.) in the flavor and fragrance industries. In perfumery, benzoin is used as a fixative, slowing the dispersion of essential oils and other fragrance materials into the air. Benzoin is used in cosmetics, veterinary medicine, and scented candles. It is used as a flavoring in alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, baked goods, chewing gum, frozen dairy, gelatins, puddings, and soft candy. == See also == * ==References== Category:Resins Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Incense material Category:Essential oils Category:Non-timber forest products ","title":"Benzoin (resin)"},{"id":"1999632","text":"Tripura Sundari (Sanskrit: त्रिपुरा सुन्दरी, IAST: Tripura Sundarī), or Lalita Maha Tripura Sundari is a Hindu goddess and one of the ten Mahavidyas the incarnations of Mahalaxmi ,Parvati. She is the Shakti/consort of Sadasiva, the Prakriti to his Purusha. Lalita manifests as Goddess Sati, Goddess Parvati, in Shakta literature. Lalita Tripura Sundari Devi is considered to be the most potent incarnation of Parvati or simply Her saguna roopa. She, along with Sadasiva is responsible for the Pancha-Krityas - Sristi or creation, Sthithi or protection, Samhara or destruction, Thirodhana or concealment of the world in Maya and Anugraha or final liberation . She is best known as the Devi glorified in the Lalita Sahasranama and as the subject of the Lalitopakhyanam (story of the goddess Lalita) in Hinduism. According to the Srikula tradition in Shaktism, Tripura Sundari is the foremost of the Mahavidyas and the highest aspect of Goddess Adi Parashakti. The Tripura Upanishad places her as the ultimate Shakti (energy, power) of the universe. She is described as the supreme consciousness, ruling from above Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Ishwara. Tripurasundari is said to sit on Sadasiva's lap in his form as Kāmeśvara, the \\"Lord of Desire\\". Tripura Sundari is also the primary goddess associated with the Shakta Tantric tradition known as Sri Vidya. == Etymology == The Sanskrit word 'Tripura' is a combination of two Sanskrit words; \\"Tri\\" meaning \\"tráyas (three)\\" and \\"pura\\" meaning a city or citadel, but also understood as referring to three cities or citadels \\"built of gold, silver, and iron, in the sky, air, and earth, by Maya for the Asuras, and burnt by Śiva\\" referring to the legend of the three cities destroyed by Shiva. However, \\"Tripura\\" can also mean \\"Śiva Śaktir (Shiva Shakti)\\" while \\"sundarī\\" means \\"a beautiful woman\\". Therefore, \\"Tripura Sundarī\\" literally means \\"She who is beautiful in the three worlds\\". The Tripura Sundari Temple is located in the district town of Udaipur in Tripura, about one and a half hour drive from Agartala. She is called Tripura because she is identical with the triangle (trikona) that symbolizes the yoni and that forms her chakra (see below). She is also called Tripura because her mantra has three clusters of syllables. Here Tripura is identified with the alphabet, from which all sounds and words proceed and which is often understood to occupy a primordial place in tantric cosmology. She is three-fold, furthermore, because she expresses herself in Brahma, Visnu, and Siva in her roles as creator, maintainer, and destroyer of the universe. She is threefold also because she represents the subject (maul), instrument (mina), and object (meya) of all things. Here again, she is identified with reality expressed in terms of speech, which involves a speaker, what is said, and objects to which the words refer. Tripura Sundari is also known by names as Ṣoḍaśī (\\"She who is the sixteenth\\"), Lalitā, Kāmeśvarī, Śrīvidyā and Raj Rajeshwari. The Shodashi Tantra refers to Shodashi as the \\"Beauty of the Three Cities,\\" or Tripurasundari. She is Tripura because she is beyond the three Gunas. She dwells in the three worlds of manas, buddhi, and chitta. She is Trayi, the unified combination of the three gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. She is also known as Lalita (the graceful one) and Kameshwari (the desire principle of the Supreme). == Iconography == Details of her appearance are found in the famous hymn in her praise, the Lalita Sahasranama, where she is said to be, == Legends == Shiva is one of the three gods who together constitute the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity. Shiva married Sati, the daughter of Daksha. Daksha and Shiva did not get along and consequently, Daksha did not invite Shiva for one of the great fire sacrifices that he conducted. However, Sati went to attend that function in spite of Shiva's protest. Daksha insulted Shiva in Sati's presence, so Sati committed suicide by jumping into the fire to end her humiliation. Consequently, Shiva decapitated Daksha, but after Shiva's anger had been reduced he allowed Daksha to be resurrected with a goat's head. This incident, i.e. death of his wife, upset Shiva and he entered into deep meditation. Sati reincarnated as Parvati, the daughter of the mountain king Himavat and his wife the apsara Mena. This was possible due to a boon was given to them by Adi Parashakti (un-manifested form of Parvati Lalita Tripura Sundari or Nirguna Brahman). Naturally, Pārvatī sought and received Shiva as her husband.William J. Wilkins, Uma – Parvati, Hindu Mythology – Vedic and Puranic, Thacker Spink London, pp 300–301 The devas faced an enemy in Tarakasura, who had a boon that he could be killed only by a son of Shiva and Parvati. So for the purpose of begetting a son from Shiva and Parvati, the devas deputed Manmatha, the god of love. Manmatha shot his flower arrows to Shiva and Parvati in order to induce love feelings in them. In anger for being tricked, Shiva opened his third eye which reduced the god of love to ashes. The devas and Rathi Devi, the wife of Manmatha, requested Shiva to give life to Manmatha. Heeding their request, Shiva stared at the ashes of Manmatha. From the ashes came Bhandasura, who made all the world impotent and ruled from the city called Shonitha pura, after which he started troubling the devas. The devas then sought the advice of Sage Narada and the Trimurti, who advised them to seek the help of Nirguna Brahman, the ultimate god head which is unmanifested i.e. Sat-Chit-Ananada (Existence- Consciousness-Bliss). Nirguna Brahman (Parashivalalita) divided itself into the male, Shambhu and the female, Adi Parashakti Parvati(who were unmanifested and beyond the manifest) and appeared before them. Shiva and Parvati agreed to take the forms of Maha Kameshwara and Kameshwari Tripura Sundari respectively, for the benefit of the universe. For this, a maha yajna (great sacrifice) was made, where the entire creation, i.e. the manifest universe, was offered as the oblation, and from the fire rose Kameshvari Tripura Sundari and Kameshvara. Tripura Sundari and Kameswara re-created the entire universe as it was before. In another story, Parvati, upon her love for and desire to charm Shiva, transforms herself into Lalita Tripura Sundari to showcase her beauty and omnipresence in the three worlds. === Abode === Her abode also called Sri Nagara(city)/Manidvipa had 25 streets circling it, made of iron, steel, copper, and lead. An alloy made of five metals, silver, gold, the white Pushpa raga stone, the red Padmaraga stone, onyx, diamond, Vaidoorya, Indra neela Blue Sapphire, pearl, Marakatha, coral, nine gems and a mixture of gems and precious stones. In the eighth street was a forest of Kadambas. This is presided by Syamala. In the fifteenth street lived the Ashta Dik palakas. In the sixteenth lived Varahi alias Dandini who was her commander in chief. Here Syamala also had a house. In the seventeenth street lived the different Yoginis. In the eighteenth street lived Maha Vishnu. In the nineteenth street lived Ishana, in the twentieth Tara Devi, twenty-first Varuni, the twenty- second Kurukulla who presides over the fort of pride, twenty third Martanda Bhairava, twenty-fourth Chandra, and twenty-fifth Manmatha presiding over the forest of love. ==== Center of city ==== In the center of Nagara is the Maha Padma Vana (the great lotus forest) and within it, the Chintamani Griha (The house of holy thought), in the northeast is the Chid agni kunda and on both sides of its eastern gate are the houses of Mantrini and Dandini. On its four gates stand the Chaturamnaya gods for watch and ward. Within it is the chakra. In the center of the Chakra on the throne of Pancha brahmas on the Bindu Pitha (dot plank) called sarvanandamaya (universal happiness) sits Maha Tripura Sundari. In the chakra are the following decorations viz., the square called Trilokya mohanam (most beautiful in the three worlds), The sixteen petaled lotus called Sarvasa paripurakam (fulfiller of all desires), the eight petaled lotus called Sarvasamksopanam (the all cleanser), the fourteen cornered figure called Sarva saubhagyam (all luck), the external ten cornered figure called Sarvartha sadhakam (giver of all assets), the internal ten cornered figure called Sarva raksha karam (All protector), the eight cornered figure called Sarva roga haram (cure of all diseases), the triangle called Sarva siddhi pradam (giver of all powers) and the dot called Sarvananda mayam. === Bhandasura === The devas prayed to her to kill Bhandasura. When she started for the war with Bandasura, she was accompanied by the powers called Anima, Mahima, Brahmani, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Maheshwari, Chamundi, Rudrani, Nitya Devaths and Avarna Devathas who occupy the chakra. While Sampatkari was the captain of the elephant regiment, Aswarooda was the captain of the cavalry. The army was commanded by Dhandini riding on the chariot called Giri Chakra assisted by Manthrini riding on the chariot called Geya Chakra. Jwala Malini protected the army by creating a fire ring around it. Tripura Sundari rode in the center on the chariot of Chakra. Nithya destroyed a large chunk of Bhandasura's armies, Bala killed the son of Bhandasura, and Manthrini and Dhandini killed his brothers called Vishanga and Vishukra. When the asuras created a blockade for the marching army, Tripura sundari created Ganesha with the help of Kameshwara to remove the blockade. Then Bhandasura created the asuras called Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakashipu and Ravana. She killed all his army using Pasupathastra and killed him with Kameshwarasthra. The gods then praised her. She then recreated Manmathan for the good of the world. This story is contained in the first 84 names of the first 34 slokas of Lalitha sahasranamam. All together it contains one thousand names. This is also called the Rahasya Nama Sahasra (the thousand secret names). Reading it, meditating on the meaning of the names would lead to the fulfillment of all the wishes of the devotees. == Literary sources  Lalita Sahasranama === Lalita Sahasranama contains a thousand names of the Hindu mother goddess Lalita. The names are organized in a hymns (stotras). It is the only sahasranama that does not repeat a single name. Further, in order to maintain the meter, sahasranamass use the artifice of adding words like tu, api, ca, and hi, which are conjunctions that do not necessarily add to the meaning of the name except in cases of interpretation. The Lalita sahasranama does not use any such auxiliary conjunctions and is unique in being an enumeration of holy names that meet the metrical, poetical and mystic requirements of a sahasranama by their order throughout the text. Lalita Sahasranama begins by calling the goddess Shri Mata (the great mother), Shri Maharajni (the great queen) and Shrimat Simhasaneshwari (the queen sitting on the lion-throne). In verses 2 and 3 of the Sahasranama she is described as a Udayatbhanu Sahasrabha (the one who is as bright as the rays of thousand rising suns), Chaturbahu Samanvita (the one who has four hands) and Ragasvarupa Pashadhya (the one who is holding the rope). Chidagnikunda Sambhuta (one who was born from the altar of the fire of consciousness) and Devakarya samudyata (one who manifested Herself for fulfilling the objects of the devas) are among other names mentioned in the sahasranama. ==== Composition ==== Lalitha sahasranama is said to have been composed by eight vak devis (vaag devathas) upon the command of Lalitha. These vaag devis are Vasini, Kameshwari, Modhinee, Vimala, Aruna, Jayinee, Sarveshwari, Koulini. The sahasranama says that \\"One can worship Lalitha only if she wishes us to do so\\". The text is a dialogue between Hayagriva, an (avatar) of Mahavishnu and the sage Agastya. The temple at Thirumeyachur, near Kumbakonam is said to be where Agastya was initiated into this sahasranama. Another alternative version is the Upanishad Bramham Mutt at kanchipuram is where this initiation happened. This sahasranama is held as a sacred text for the worship of the \\"Divine Mother\\", Lalita, and is used in the worship of Durga, Parvati, Kali, and other forms of Parvati. A principal text of Shakti worshipers, it names her various attributes, and these names are organized in the form of a hymn. This sahasranama is used in various modes for the worship of the Divine Mother. Some of the modes of worship are parayana (Recitations), archana, homa etc. This stotra (hymn of praise) occurs in the Brahmanda Purana (history of the universe) in the chapter on a discussion between Hayagreeva and Agasthya. Hayagreeva is an incarnation of Vishnu with the head of a horse who is held to be the storehouse of knowledge. Agasthya is one of the sages of yore and one of the stars of the constellation Saptarshi (Ursa major). At the request of Agasthya, Hayagreeva is said to have taught him the thousand holiest names of Lalita. This has been conveyed to us by the sage Maharishi Vyasa. Lalitha Sahasranama is the only sahasranama composed by vag devatas under Lalitha's direction. All the other sahasranamas are said to have been composed by Maharishi Vyasa. ==== Structure ==== The slokas are organized in such a way that Devi is described from head to feet (kesadhi padham). There are basically five works (pancha krtyam). They are creation (srishti), protection (sthiti), destruction (samharam), hiding (thirudhanam) and blessing (anugraham). Devi herself has been described as \\"pancha krtya parayana\\" in the sloka and the five tasks are described as follows: This means Devi is the aspect of Brahma, while creating sristhi, aspect of Vishnu while sustaining sristhi, aspect of Rudra during dissolution sanghara. These five entities (Brahmma, Vishnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadasiva) are known as \\"pancha-brahma\\". Lalitha has designated the five functions to these brahmam. Sometimes, Devi will take away the life from these five brahmmam and make them inactive, performing all the five tasks herself. At that time they will be called \\"pancha pretam\\" that is lifeless bodies.The first three slokas are: Srimata (great mother) – srshti; Sri Maharajni (great ruler) – sthithi; Srimat Simhasaneswari (one who sits on the lion throne) – samharam. The rest of the slokas cover thirodhanam and anugraham. The next names – \\"chidhagnikunda sambhutha devakarya samudhyatha\\" tells us that devi arose from the fire of knowledge to help devas in their task (war against asuras – bhandasura). From the namAa- Udhyath bhanu sahasraba till sinjanamani manjeera manditha sree padambuja, all her parts like her face, fore head, eyes, mouth, tongue, voice, hands and legs have been described.Thereafter, Devi's place (Chintamani gruham), her war against bandasura, kundalini shakti, and her properties have been described. A common image of the goddess depicts a parrot and a sugarcane with her. Sugarcane represents the sweetness of her mind. === References in Hindu literature === The Soundarya Lahari of Adi Shankaracharya deals exhaustively about the nature of the Goddess and her worship. The Lalitopakyana tells of the epic battle between her forces and the forces of the arch-demon Bhandasura. The Tripura Sundari Ashtakam by Adi Shankaracharya describes her as a Mother wearing a blue and red-spotted dress and holding a pot of honey. == Srichakra == The Sri Yantra in diagrammatic form, showing how its nine interlocking triangles form a total of 43 smaller triangles. In the Shri Vidya school of Hindu tantra, the Sri Yantra (\\"sacred instrument\\"), also Sri Chakra is a diagram formed by nine interlocking triangles that surround and radiate out from the central (bindu) point. It represents the goddess in her form of Shri Lalita Or Tripura Sundari, \\"the beauty of the three worlds (earth, atmosphere and sky(heaven)\\"(Bhoo, Bhuva and Swa). The worship of the Sri Chakra is central to the Shri Vidya system of Hindu worship. Four isosceles triangles with the apices upwards, representing Shiva or the Masculine. Five isosceles triangles with the apices downward, symbolizing female embodiment Shakti. Thus the Sri Yantra also represents the union of Masculine and Feminine Divine. Because it is composed of nine triangles, it is known as the Navayoni Chakra. \\"These nine triangles are of various sizes and intersect with one another. In the middle is the power point (bindu), visualizing the highest, the invisible, elusive centre from which the entire figure and the cosmos expand. The triangles are enclosed by two rows of (8 and 16) petals, representing the lotus of creation and reproductive vital force. The broken lines of the outer frame denote the figure to be a sanctuary with four openings to the regions of the universe\\". In a recent issue of Brahmavidya, the journal of the Adyar Library, Subhash Kak argues that the description of Sri Yantra is identical to the yantra described in the Śvetāśvatara Upanisad.http://ikashmir.net/subhashkak/docs/SriChakra.pdf Subhash Kak, The Great Goddess Lalitā and the Śrī Cakra. Brahmavidyā: The Adyar Library Bulletin, vol. 72–73, pp. 155–172, 2008–2009 Together the nine triangles are interlaced in such a way as to form 43 smaller triangles in a web symbolic of the entire cosmos or a womb symbolic of creation. Together they express Advaita or non-duality. This is surrounded by a lotus of eight petals, a lotus of sixteen petals, and an earth square resembling a temple with four doors. The various deities residing in the nine layers of the Sri Yantra are described in the Devi Khadgamala Mantra. The Shri Chakra is also known as the nava chakra because it can also be seen as having nine levels. \\"Nine\\" comes from\\" Nava\\" of Sanskrit. Each level corresponds to a mudra, a yogini, and a specific form of the Deity Tripura Sundari along with her mantra. These levels starting from the outside or bottom layer are: #Trailokya Mohana or Bhupara, a square of three lines with four portals #Sarva Aasa Paripuraka, a sixteen-petal lotus #Sarva Sankshobahana, an eight-petal lotus #Sarva Saubhagyadayaka, composed of fourteen small triangles #Sara Arthasadhaka, composed of ten small triangles #Sarva Rakshakara, composed of ten small triangles #Sarva Rogahara, composed of eight small triangles #Sarva Siddhiprada, composed of 1 small triangle #Sarva Anandamaya, composed of a point or bindu The Sri Chakra (called the Shri Yantra) is the symbol of Hindu tantra, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism. The Sri Yantra is the object of devotion in Sri Vidya. The two dimensional Sri Chakra, when it is projected into three dimensions is called a Maha Meru (Mount Meru). == Temples dedicated to her worship == Her most important temple is the Kanchi Kamakshi temple in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. Kanchipuram is one of the moksha puris. Sage Durvasa done intense penance in Kanchipuram and the pleased Lalita Tripura Sundari appeared and agrees to reside in Kanchi for the benefit of her devotees. Sage Durvasa installed the Sri Chakra in this temple. It is also the place of Kanchi Kamakoti mandali. Her temple, the Tripura Sundari temple is located on top of the hills near Radhakishorepur village, a little distance away from Udaipur town in Tripura and in Banaswara, Rajasthan. In West Bengal, there is a temple of Ma Tripura Sundari Devi located in Boral, near Garia. In Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, there is Tripura Sundari temple about 12 km from city on Bhedaghat road in village Tewar. In the outskirts of Chennai, is the Shri Tirusoolanathar Tripurasundari temple, an ancient temple built by Kulothunga Chola I in the 11th century. The Trisula Nathar Temple is dedicated to Sri Shiva as Trisula Nathar and Divine Mother Shakti as Tripura Sundari Amman. A temple of Tripura Sundari temple is in Chhatrabhog (Saturbhog).Discovery of North East India vol-11 Page −5 edited by S.K. Sharma & Usha Sharma published by Mittal Publication A-110 Mohan Garden New Delhi 110059 India ISBN NO:81-8324-045-3 It is situated in south 24 Pgs under Diamond Harbour Subdivision West Bengal. The nearest railway station is Mathurapur Road in Sealdah South section. From the source of Rajratnakar descendants of Drajhu king, Kalinda made a wooden Tripura Sundari icon at this place. Many temples of Goddess Raj Rajeshwari are also found in Uttarakhand, where she is considered as the Kul-devi. A temple of Tripura Sundari is located at tripuradevi village in Berinag and Tripura Sundri amma (Thibbadevi) temple in Muguru is located in the Tirumakudal Narsipur taluk of Mysore district in Karnataka. Tripura sundari in her form Raja Rajeshwari is worshiped in Kandamangalam Sree Rajarajeshwari temple located in the village Kadakkarapalli, Cherthala taluk, Alappuzha district, Kerala. The temple is named as Kanadamangalam by Sree Narayana Guru (social reformer and spiritual leader) which comprises two words \\"Kandal\\" which means if you see and \\"mangalam\\" which means good fortune.

She is a Distinguished University Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, College Park. She is also the former head of the Department of African-American Studies at the University of Cincinnati, and a past President of the American Sociological Association. Collins was the 100th president of the ASA and the first African-American woman to hold this position. Collins's work primarily concerns issues involving feminism, gender, and social inequality within the African-American community. She first came to national attention for her book Black Feminist Thought, originally published in 1990.Collins, Patricia. 2000. Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment. Routledge. ==Early life and career== Collins was born on May 1, 1948, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents were Albert Hill, a factory worker and Second World War veteran, and Eunice Randolph Hill, a secretary. Her parents met in Washington, DC, where Eunice had migrated to find work after the end of the war. Patricia has no siblings. Collins attended the Philadelphia public schools—and even at a young age, Collins had the realization of her lived reality—she attended a school that catered to mostly white middle class students that was in a predominantly black neighborhood. During the time of the 1950s and 1960s, when Patricia was going to school, most schools in northern cities like Philadelphia were channels for social mobility, and although they were well funded, they were not particularly easy to navigate, especially for African-Americans and people of color like Patricia. However, to her advantage, Patricia was part of a cohort of working-youth who had educational opportunities long denied to their parents. She attended Frederick Douglas Elementary School and later Philadelphia High School for Girls (aka Girls' High), which was founded in 1848 as the nation's first public high school for women only. Collins had the unique experience of attending Girls' High during the 1960s process of desegregation of schools, which contributed to her growing interest in sociology, feminism, and activism for African- American and civil rights. Collins went on to pursue an undergraduate career at Brandeis University in 1965 as a sociology major, receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1969. She proceeded to earn a Master of Arts degree in Teaching (MAT) in Social Science Education from Harvard University in 1970. From 1970 to 1976, she was a teacher and curriculum specialist at St. Joseph Community School in Roxbury, Boston, among two others. She went on to become the Director of the Africana Center at Tufts University from 1976 to 1980. At Tufts, she met and married Roger L. Collins, a professor of education at the University of Cincinnati, with whom she has one daughter, Valerie L. Collins. She completed her doctorate in sociology back at Brandeis in 1984. While earning her PhD, Collins worked as an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati, alongside her husband, beginning in 1982. In 1986, Collins published her first piece of writing in a sociological journal titled Social Problems. Titled \\"Learning From the Outsider Within\\", the article put Collins on the map as a sociologist as well as an activist for feminism and rights for African Americans. The article, published four years prior to her first book, articulates a standpoint reflecting her race, social class, and gender while she moved across and within various institutions. It also focuses on how African-American women have made creative use of their marginality, or \\"outsider\\" status, and benefited from this different way of thinking, a way of thinking that put themselves in the shoes of those who marginalize them. In 1990, Collins published her first book, Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment. A revised 10th-anniversary edition of the book was published in 2000, and subsequently translated into Korean in 2009. In 2005, Collins joined the University of Maryland's department of sociology as a Distinguished University Professor. Working closely with graduate students on issues regarding race, feminist thought, and feminist theory, she maintains an active research agenda and continues to write books and articles in relations to social, racial, and gender issues. Her current work has transcended the borders of the United States, in keeping with the recognition within sociological globalized social system. Collins is focused on understanding, in her own words, \\"How African American male and female youth's experiences with social issues of education, unemployment, popular culture and political activism articulate with global phenomena, specifically, complex social inequalities, global capitalist development, transnationalism, and political activism.\\" ==Books== In 1990, Collins published Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment, which looked at the title topic through such figures as Angela Davis, Alice Walker and Audre Lorde. The analysis incorporated a wide range of sources, including fiction, poetry, music and oral history. This book is the first book to incorporate the literature of and by African-American women. Collins's work concluded with three central claims: *Oppressions of race, class, gender, sexuality and nation are intersecting, mutually constructing systems of power. Collins utilizes the term intersectionality, coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, to refer to this simultaneous overlapping of multiple forms of oppression. *Because black women have unique histories at the intersections of systems of power, they have created world views out of a need for self- definition and to work on behalf of social justice. Black women's specific experiences with intersecting systems of oppression provide a window into these same processes for other individuals and social groups. In Black Feminist Thought, Collins posits how black feminist studies made of black women's works highlight two very important themes. One being \\"how Black women's paid work is organized within intersecting oppressions of race, class, and gender.\\" Although these women have fled from domestic work in private homes, they continue to work at low-paying jobs. Moreover, she continues, the theme that \\"concerns how Black women's unpaid family labor is simultaneously confining and empowering\\" for them is also extremely important. Collins emphasizes this point because she points out that black women see the unpaid work of their household as a method of resistance to oppression rather than a method of manipulation by men. Published in 1992, Race, Class and Gender: An Anthology was a collaboration with Margaret Andersen, in which Collins helped edit a compilation of essays on of race, class and gender. The book is widely recognized for shaping the field of race, class and gender studies, as well as its related concept of intersectionality. The essays cover a variety of topics, from historical trends and their lasting effects today, to the current media portrayal of minority groups. The sixth edition was published in 2007.Andersen, Margaret L., and Patricia Hill Collins (2012): Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology. Belmont, California: Wadsworth Cengage Learning. Collins published a third book Fighting Words: Black Women and the Search for Justice in 1998. Fighting Words focused on how black women have confronted the injustices against them within black communities, expanding on the idea of \\"outsiders within\\" from her previous book. She examines how outsiders resist the majority's perspective, while simultaneously pushing for and creating new insight on the social injustices that exist. Collins also notes how acknowledging the social theories of oppressed groups are important because their different experiences have created new angles of looking at human rights and injustice. This has not always been the case because, as she points out, the \\"elites possess the power to legitimate the knowledge that they define as theory as being universal, normative, and ideal\\". Fighting Words seeks to explore how black women can change from simply having \\"thoughts\\" to rather being considered as having \\"theories\\". Collins's next book was Black Sexual Politics: African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism, published in 2004. This work argued that racism and heterosexism were intertwined, and that ideals of beauty work to oppress African-Americans males and females, whether homo-, bi- or heterosexual. Collins asserts that people must examine the intersection of race, class, and gender, and that looking at each issue separately leads to missing a large part of the problem. Her argument for resisting the creation of such narrow gender roles requires action on individual and community levels, and recognizing success in areas other than those typically respected by Americans, such as money or beauty. Collins also contends that the oppression of African Americans cannot be successfully resisted until oppressions within their own group, such as towards women or LGBT people, are stopped. Black Sexual Politics won the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award from the American Sociological Association. In 2006 she published From Black Power to Hip Hop: Racism, Nationalism, and Feminism, which examines the relationship between black nationalism, feminism and women in the hip-hop generation. The book is a compilation of multiple essays by her, written over multiple years, compiled into one cohesive examination of the current situation of African Americans. Collins examines the prejudice existing today, which she calls \\"new racism,\\" and explores how old ideas about what racism is prevents society from recognizing and fixing the wrongdoings that still greatly exist. The author explores a range of examples, from American identity, to motherhood, to feminine portrayal in hip-hop. Following the Civil Rights Movement, she argues, there was a \\"shift from color-conscious racism that relied on strict racial segregation to a seemingly colorblind racism that promised equal opportunities yet provided no lasting avenues for African American advancement\\". In 2009, Collins published Another Kind of Public Education: Race, Schools, the Media and Democratic Possibilities, in which she encourages the public to be more aware of and prevent the institutional discrimination that African-American children are experiencing today in the public education system. Collins explains that teachers have a great deal of power to be the facilitators of either discriminatory attitudes or tolerant attitudes; they are the \\"frontline actors negotiating the social issues of our time.\\" Claiming that the education system is greatly influenced by the media, Collins examines racism as a system of power preventing education and democracy to reach its full potential.Collins, Patricia Hill, and Simmons College (2009). Another Kind of Public Education: Race, Schools, the Media and Democratic Possibilities. Boston: Beacon Press. Collins co- edited with John Solomos The Handbook of Race and Ethnic Studies (2010), and in 2012 published On Intellectual Activism. In 2016, Collins also published the book Intersectionality, with co-author Sirma Bilge, which discusses, in depth, the intertwined nature of social categorizations such as race, class and gender, and how they create a complex web of discrimination and disadvantage in society. Topics covered include social inequality, stratification, and civil rights, using contemporary examples such as specific companies, big business, and the FIFA world cup outcomes. ==Career honors== Collins is recognized as a social theorist, drawing from many intellectual traditions. She reconceptualizes the ideas of race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression. Her more than 40 articles and essays have been published in a wide range of fields, including philosophy, history, psychology, and most notably sociology. *Faculty of the Year Award at the University of Cincinnati (1991) *C.

Instead, the Tole Mour can be considered a topsail schooner with a fore course. Also see its description as a schooner by its builders on (pdf file) and sail training vessel operating in the Channel Islands of California, off the West Coast of the United States. Built by the Nichols Bros. Boat Builders on Whidbey Island in Washington's Puget Sound to withstand the extreme conditions of the South Pacific, she is extremely seaworthy and meets or exceeds all of the United States Coast Guard's regulations as a Sailing School Vessel, while offering luxurious accommodations in comparison to other tall ships. At 229 gross registered tons she is the largest active tall ship on the West Coast. The Tole Mour was originally commissioned by the Marimed Foundation of Hawai’i in 1988 as a self-contained primary health care support vessel, operating in the US trust territory protectorate of the Marshall Islands. The name of the ship was selected by a competition of Marshall Islands school children, and means 'A Gift of Life and Health' in the Marshallese language. With onboard medical, dental and ophthalmological offices, the Tole Mour provided medical services to over 15,000 islanders over a period of 4 years, until the Marshallese government commissioned their own fleet of medical delivery vessels and the Tole Mour returned to Hawai’i to serve other purposes. In her most recent incarnation, she was part of the Guided Discoveries' Catalina Island Marine Institute, offering sail training, oceanography and marine biology education to hundreds of school-aged participants a year. The professional crew was housed in up into 6 double cabins and 2 master rooms within her 123 feet on deck and beam. Up to 36 youth participants could be accommodated in cabins housing 4, 8 and 10 berths. Her previous medical requirements provided areas for laboratory equipment, touch tanks, and aquariums. In 2014, the Tole Mour was sold to Island Windjammers, a charter cruise company operating in the Caribbean Sea. She underwent a refitting, as well as a name change, and is now known as Vela. ==See also== * List of schooners ==ReferencesExternal links== *CIMI Tallship Expeditions *Marimed Foundation *Marshall Islands Archive Entry on the Tole Mour *The American Sail Training Association *Ewbank Naval Architects formerly Ewbank Brooke & Associates Category:Schooners of the United States Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Training ships Category:Sail training ships Category:Tall ships of the United States Category:Three-masted ships Category:1988 ships Category:Ships built in Washington (state) ","title":"Tole Mour"},{"id":"1999647","text":"was a Japanese samurai daimyō of the early Edo period. ==Early life== Tadazane was the son of (1569–1615) with Toku-hime, daughter of Matsudaira Nobuyasu and granddaughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

In 1989, as a radical Croatian nationalist, he joined the nationalist Croatian Democratic Party () and won a seat in the first assembly of the Croatian Parliament in the 1990 elections, when his party was aligned with the Coalition of People's Accord. In the late 1991, Prkačin moved to the Croatian Party of Rights. He soon became one of its representatives in Croatian Parliament, after the second Sabor election. In 1992, when the war escalated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Prkačin took part as a leader of HSP militia Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage, HOS) with the rank of general, and had close co-operation with government of Alija Izetbegović. After Blaž Kraljević was killed in August 1992, Prkačin participated in the negotiations of HOS and Croatian Defence Council (HVO). In the fall of the same year, he was a member of the joint command of Croatian Defence Council and Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After HOS was disbanded, Prkačin was commander of the defence of Posavina as HVO officer. Upon his return to Croatia, he began to distance himself from Dobroslav Paraga and spent the rest of his Sabor days as independent representative. He left HSP in 1995. In October 1999, he founded a new party called New Croatia (Nova Hrvatska), and under its banner ran for Croatian President. In the first round of the 2000 Croatian presidential election he won just 0.28% of the vote, finishing 7th, and was eliminated. While not achieving much in the world of politics, Prkačin managed to remain in public spotlight by often appearing in various talk shows and being involved in Croatian entertainment industry. In 2001 he tried acting and played the role of a priest in a movie Slow Surrender. In 2004, Prkačin was briefly in the public spotlight after two of his friends engaged in an urban gunfight in Slavonski Brod because of a conflict between him and Mladen Kruljac, another officer from the Croatian war. In January 2009, Prkačin testified as a witness before a court in Sarajevo regarding the 1999 assassination of Jozo Leutar, the then-Minister of Internal Affairs of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Three months later, Ante Jelavić said Prkačin had implicated him and accused him of being a former member of Yugoslav secret service KOS. In August 2009, one Sakib Balić, a former HOS soldier, publicly accused Prkačin of commanding HOS units that participated in the Sijekovac killings, when numerous Serb civilians were killed in the village of Sijekovac near Bosanski Brod on 26 March 1992. The same accusation was echoed by one Ane Mihajlović, a veteran from the Army of Republika Srpska, at the event in May 2010 when Ivo Josipović and Sulejman Tihić visited the site to pay respect to around fifty civilian victims of the March 1992 events. The site and the visit provoked some controversy in the Croatian public, with allegations of impropriety levelled against President Josipović and the authorities of Republika Srpska. In 2011 Prkačin returned to Croatian Party of Rights. ==References== Category:Representatives in the modern Croatian Parliament Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Croatian Party of Rights politicians Category:Croatian Democratic Party politicians Category:Candidates for President of Croatia Category:Croatian nationalists Category:Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina soldiers Category:Croatian Defence Council soldiers ","title":"Ante Prkačin"},{"id":"1999674","text":"In Australia, Diversional Therapy “is a client centred practice [that] recognises that leisure and recreational experiences are the right of all individuals.”What Is Diversional Therapy Diversional Therapists promote the involvement in leisure, recreation and play by reducing barriers to their client's participation and providing opportunities where the individual may choose to participate. Ideally these recreational activities promote self- esteem and personal fulfillment, through an emphasis on holistic care; providing physical, psychological, social, intellectual and spiritual/cultural support. Diversional Therapists work in a wide variety of settings, such as Rehabilitation & hospital units, Justice Centres, Community Centres, Day and Respite services, Aged Care Residential Facilities, Ethnic Specific Services, Palliative Care Units and Outreach Programmes, Mental Health Services, Specialist Organisations, Private Practice, Consultancy & Management.Diversional Therapy Association of NSW The diversional therapist works with a client to achieve positive health outcomes by incorporating leisure programmes into their lifestyles. He or she assists decision-making and participation when developing and managing these programmes. These are often quite diverse and can range from: · Games, outings, gardening, computers, gentle exercise, music, arts and crafts. · Individual emotional and social support · Sensory enrichment, activities like massage and aromatherapy, pet therapy · Discussion groups, education sessions like grooming, beauty care, cooking · Social, cultural and spiritual activities(Quality Care Training, 2003)< Diversional Therapy is not just about passing the time, about being entertainers or babysitters. As an unknown author once said \\"Recreation's purpose is not to kill time, but to make time live; not to keep people occupied, but to keep them refreshed; not to offer an escape from life, but to provide a discovery of life.\\"http://www.recreationtherapy.com/trquotes.htm == Becoming a Diversional Therapist == To become a diversional therapist in Australia you must complete a diploma or degree in diversional therapy or leisure and health studies and this course needs to be recognised by the Diversional Therapy Association of Australia. Entry to the degree courses usually requires completion of your HSC/ACT Year 12 with prerequisite subjects, or assumed knowledge, in one or more of English, chemistry or biology. The various universities have different prerequisites and some have flexible entry requirements or offer external study. Contact the universities you are interested in for more information as requirements may change.http://www.diversionaltherapy.com.au In New Zealand, you can complete a National Certificate in Diversion Therapy. This course of study generally takes 18 months to complete, and participants must have already achieved a Level 3 Core Competencies qualification, which is a basic all-round groundwork course. The diversional therapy courses are usually offered by institutions that focus on practical learning and skills, teaching about the roles of the diversional therapist and developing the ability to create a plan of care. == Benefits of Leisure== Leisure has many well documented health related benefits. Physical Benefits can include: • Decrease in blood pressure • Decrease in heart rate • Increase in bone mass and strength • Increase in lung capacity • Reduction in incidence of diabetes • Increase in muscle strength • Increase in sense of well being • Increase in flexibility, balance and coordination • Improvement in immune system (Ayvazoglu, Ratliffe & Kozub, 2004; Academy of Leisure Sciences, n.d.) Emotional Benefits can include: • Happiness • Life satisfaction • Morale • Self-concept • Self-esteem • Perceived sense of freedom • Independence • Autonomy • Self-confidence • Leadership skills • Tolerance/Understanding • Problem solving skills(Mannell & Kleiber, 1997; The Academy of Leisure Sciences, n.d ==Further information== *Diversional Therapy Association NSW Inc *Human Resource Management, ACT Health *NSW Health *Diversional Therapy Resources *Diversional Therapy Monthly Magazine & Online Activities ==See also== *Recreational therapy *Leisure ==References== Category:Therapy ","title":"Diversional therapy"},{"id":"1999675","text":"In acting, substitution is the understanding of elements in the life of one's character by comparing them to elements in one's own life. For example, if an actor is portraying a character who is being blackmailed, he or she could think back to some embarrassing or private fact about his or her own life, and mentally superimpose that onto the character's secret. In Respect for Acting, Uta Hagen compares acting to make believe, saying, \\"My strength as an actor rested in the unshakable faith I had in make-believe. I made myself believe the characters I was allowed to play and the circumstances of the characters' lives in the events of the play.\\" And later in the book, \\"I use substitution in order to 'make believe' in its literal sense-- to make me believe [...], in order to send me into the moment-to-moment spontaneous action of my newly selected self on stage.\\" Hagen is clear that substitution is a means to further connect actors to their characters and the actions of the play, as opposed to, for instance, bringing on tears. \\"Substitution is not an end in itself, not an end to involve you for self-involvement's sake without consequent action. Let me state strongly, in case any of you have misunderstood, that substitution is the aspect of the work which strengthens your faith and your sense of reality in each stage of the total work on character. It is a way of bringing about justified, personal character actions.\\" Hagen also warns against confronting any traumatic experiences, believing it to be unhelpful. \\"There are teachers who actually force actors into dealing with something buried (their response to a death of a parent, or the trauma of a bad accident). What results is hysteria or worse, and is, in my opinion, anti-art. We are not pursuing psychotherapy.

There are many skyscrapers in Raffles Place, Tanjong Pagar and Marina Bay CBD with a height limit of 280m. It is one of the eleven planning areas located within the most urbanised Central Area, forming the latter's dense urban core. It is bounded by Rochor to the north, Kallang to the northeast, Marina East and Marina South to the east, Straits View to the southeast, Bukit Merah to the south, as well as Outram, Museum and Singapore River to the west. As the financial Heart of Singapore, the Downtown Core houses the headquarters and offices of numerous corporations, as well as the Singapore Exchange. The area is also home to many governmental institutions, notably the seat of Parliament and the Supreme Court of Singapore. Singapore's modern history began in this area, when Stamford Raffles and representatives of the British East India Company landed along the banks of the Singapore River to set up a free port in Southeast Asia. As the old harbour grew along the mouth of the river bank, the city naturally expanded around it, creating what is now the Central Area. The name \\"Downtown Core\\" remains relatively unheard of and the term Central Business District (CBD) is commonly used in conversation instead. However, the area known as the CBD actually comprises a smaller area within the Downtown Core itself, taking up the south-western and western portions of the planning area. It is made up of eight subzones, Anson, Cecil, Clifford Pier, Maxwell, Phillip, Raffles Place and Tanjong Pagar and Marina Centre. The core of the CBD has since extended well beyond its boundaries and the term is even often at times used to refer to the Central Area as a whole. ==History== Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown Core As a fledgling colony, the area which is now known as the Downtown Core was the financial, administrative and commercial centre of the colony. In 1823, Singapore was reorganised according to the Raffles Plan of Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles, which specified elements like the Commercial Square (now Raffles Place) and the European Town as well as various other commercial and administrative entities located between them. This area later became the Downtown Core. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Draft Master Plan 2003 - Central Region Category:Downtown Core (Singapore) Singapore pt:Área Central de Cingapura ","title":"Downtown Core"},{"id":"1999712","text":"Humberside was abolished in 1996 both as a county council and a ceremonial county, but the name Humberside continues to be used unofficially in subsequent boundary reviews as presented by the Boundary Commission for England to describe the area covered by the former county for the purpose of the rules which strongly deter cross-council constituencies (spanning more than one local authority within its area).

These changes were implemented at the 2010 United Kingdom general election. == Proposed boundary changes == The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010. Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota. ==Results history== Primary data source: House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019 === 2019 === The number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Humberside in the 2019 general election were as follows: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Party !Votes !% !Change from 2017 !Seats !Change from 2017 |- |Conservative |231,091 |55.7% |7.1% |7 |2 |- |Labour |122,074 |29.4% |12.7% |3 |2 |- |Liberal Democrats |26,312 |6.3% |2.6% |0 |0 |- |Brexit |20,595 |5.0% |new |0 |0 |- |Greens |10,275 |2.5% |1.4% |0 |0 |- |Others |4,322 |1.1% |3.4% |0 |0 |- |Total |414,669 |100.0 | |10 | |} === Percentage votes === {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Election year !1983 !1987 !1992 !1997 !2001 !2005 !2010 !2015 !2017 !2019 |- |Conservative |43.8 |41.9 |41.7 |30.4 |32.8 |33.0 |36.8 |38.4 |48.6 |55.7 |- |Labour |29.2 |34.8 |40.3 |50.4 |46.7 |41.0 |30.8 |33.9 |42.1 |29.4 |- |Liberal Democrat1 |26.8 |23.1 |17.4 |15.8 |17.1 |20.8 |22.5 |5.4 |3.7 |6.3 |- |Green Party | - |* |* |* |* |* |0.7 |3.1 |1.1 |2.5 |- |UKIP | - | - | - |* |* |* |4.5 |18.0 |3.2 |* |- |Brexit Party | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |5.0 |- |Other |0.2 |0.2 |0.6 |3.3 |3.4 |5.2 |4.7 |1.2 |1.3 |1.1 |} 11983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance * Included in Other === Seats === {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Election year !1983 !1987 !1992 !1997 !2001 !2005 !2010 !2015 !2017 !2019 |- |Conservative |5 |4 |4 |3 |3 |3 |5 |5 |5 |7 |- |Labour |4 |5 |5 |7 |7 |7 |5 |5 |5 |3 |- |Total |9 |9 |9 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |} 11983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance === Maps === File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency1983Results.svg|1983 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|1987 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|1992 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|1997 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|2001 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|2005 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|2010 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|2015 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|2017 File:HumbersideParliamentaryConstituency2019Results.svg|2019 ==Historical representation by party== Data given here is for the East Riding of Yorkshire before 1983.

Records in the mid-1980s. Rough Cutt never achieved the commercial success enjoyed by many other Los Angeles bands of that time but various members went on to success in other groups, including Jake E. Lee with Ozzy Osbourne, Amir Derakh with Orgy, Paul Shortino with Quiet Riot, and Craig Goldy and Claude Schnell with Dio. After the end of their work with Warner Brothers, Rough Cutt signed with Virgin Records in the early 1990s. The band released its fourth studio album, Lapsed On My Own (1993), and toured steadily, playing festivals in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany. The current line-up of Rough Cutt, which debuted on November 29, 2019 at the Bossanova Ballroom in Portland, Oregon is drummer Dave Alford, first guitarist Chris Hager, second guitarist Darren Housholder (Shrapnel Records recording artist, Love/Hate, War & Peace), bassist Jeff Buehner (The Loyal Order), and lead vocalist Steven St. James. ==History== The first Rough Cutt line-up featured vocalist Paul Shortino, drummer Dave Alford, guitarist Jake E. Lee, keyboardist Claude Schnell, and bassist Joey Cristofanilli. Both Lee and Alford had also previously been in another Los Angeles band, Ratt. Both Schnell and Cristofanilli had previously been in the band Magic. Two other former Ratt members and band mates in Sarge, guitarist Chris Hager and bassist Matt Thorne a.k.a. Matt Thorr (who replaced Cristofanilli) would also soon join Rough Cutt. After his departure, Cristofanilli temporarily joined Ratt himself, later joining forces with members of the band Sin who went on to release the album Made In Heaven under the name Jag Wire in 1985. Lee left Rough Cutt in 1982, auditioned for, and was hired briefly by the band Dio, and then replaced the deceased Randy Rhoads as Ozzy Osbourne's guitarist. Lee in turn was replaced by Craig Goldy, formerly of the San Diego band Vengeance. Ronnie James Dio greatly influenced the development of the band. Dio's wife Wendy Dio was the group's manager, and Dio himself helped write one of the band's songs. Rough Cutt contributed two tracks, \\"A Little Kindness\\" and \\"Used & Abused\\", both produced by Dio and featuring Jake E Lee on guitar, to the compilation album L.A's Hottest Unsigned Bands, issued in 1983. Another Dio-produced track, \\"Try A Little Harder\\", with Goldy on guitar featured on the KLOS 95 1/2: Rock to Riches compilation, along with another Wendy Dio project NuHaven, released later on in 1983. Goldy soon left the band, and went on to play in Giuffria, and later in Dio's band. Goldy was replaced by Amir Derakh, another San Diego band alumnus. With the line-up solidified with Shortino, Alford, Derakh, Hager, and Thorne, Rough Cutt was signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1984. The band gained national exposure when they appeared on the 'Rock Palace' TV show performing the songs \\"Crank It Up\\", \\"Dreamin' Again\\", \\"Street Gang Livin'\\", and \\"Try A Little Harder.\\" Hosted by comedian Howie Mandel, the recording took place on January 1, 1984 at the Hollywood Palace, now the Avalon Hollywood. Rough Cutt also made their way to Europe showcasing at London's famed Marquee Club on April 13, 1984 and playing a badly promoted show at the Fabrik in Hamburg, Germany, both well in advance of recording their first studio album. After waiting around for a year to work with producer Ted Templeman, who had signed the band to Warner Bros. but was busy with David Lee Roth, Eric Clapton and Aerosmith at the time, Rough Cutt decided to record their debut album, Rough Cutt (1985), with Tom Allom instead. The band toured extensively in the United States as an opening act supporting Krokus on their The Blitz tour, alongside Accept, followed by an extensive trek with Dio on their Sacred Heart tour, which lasted from August through December 1985. Rough Cutt were also part of the Super Rock '85 festival bill on August 10, 1985 at Odaiba-Undohiroba in Odaiba, Tokyo, Japan, sharing the stage with headliners Dio, Foreigner, Mama's Boys, Sting, and Japanese act, Earthshaker. The show was commemorated with a VHS release titled Super Rock In Japan '85; Rough Cutt was featured with four songs from their debut album, \\"Black Widow\\", \\"Take Her\\", \\"Dreamin' Again\\", and \\"Piece of My Heart.\\" Veteran producer Jack Douglas of Aerosmith fame guided the band's follow-up effort Wants You! (1986). Rough Cutt joined Dio on the last date of their Sacred Heart tour at the R.C. Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico on October 10, 1986 and once again made their way to Japan. While in Japan, Shortino made the decision to leave the band due to internal differences about what direction their music should take, Rough Cutt's manager Wendy Dio introduced Shortino to Quiet Riot and engineered a deal for him to step in as their new lead singer in place of Kevin DuBrow who had been fired. Shortino was briefly replaced by Parramore McCarty of Warrior before Rough Cutt called it quits. Derakh, Thorne and Alford re-grouped with singer Danny Simon and guitarist Michael Raphael to form Jailhouse, releasing a live EP, Alive in a Mad World, in 1989; while Hager would team up with Jeff Warner of Black 'N Blue in Woop & the Count. Thorne was also briefly a member of L.A. Rocks, renamed Eyes once vocalist James Christian entered the fray, while Derakh found major success with self-proclaimed death pop band Orgy in the late 1990s. In 1996, DeRock Records released Rough Cutt Live which contained three new studio cuts, \\"House of Pain\\", \\"Prowler\\", and \\"Peyote\\", as bonus tracks. The same label would also issue a full-length studio album by Rough Cutt offshoot Jailhouse in 1998, with all five songs from the 1989 Alive in a Mad World EP added as bonus tracks. Shortino reformed Rough Cutt in 2000 with an all-new lineup that included former Aerosmith guitarist Jimmy Crespo, keyboardist James 'J.T.' Garrett, Shortino's former Quiet Riot bandmate bassist Sean McNabb, and Magnitude 9 drummer John Homan. The band announced the release of an EP, titled Sneak Peek, in 2000 but it was canceled and expanded into a full length-album instead. Sacred Place was released in 2002 under the name Paul Shortino's The Cutt on Shortino's own MusicWorks Entertainment label and featured additional contributions by guitarists Brad Gillis, Carlos Cavazo, Howard Leese, and Dave Whiston as well as bassists Chuck Wright and Jason Boyleston. The classic Warner Bros. era line-up of Rough Cutt reformed for a one-off reunion show in October 2002 at the Viper Room in Hollywood with Shortino, Alford, Derakh, Hager, and Thorne performing together once again. In late 2005, Wounded Bird Records re-issued both Rough Cutt Warner Bros. studio albums as a two-for-one single disc, Rough Cutt/Rough Cutt Wants You. British label Rock Candy re-issued remastered versions of both albums in 2016, complete with 16-page full color booklets, 3500 word essays about the making of the album with new band member interviews, and enhanced artwork. In 2008, Deadline Records issued the double disc Anthology consisting of pre- and post-Warner Bros. era demos and a live set recorded in Syracuse, New York in 1985. In October 2019, 10 songs from the Fiddler's Studio Sessions portion of the Anthology were released as The Fiddler Sessions '84 on limited edition red vinyl, with only 300 copies made. In 2016, the classic lineup of Shortino, Alford, Derakh, Hager, and Thorne reunited again. They played on the Monsters of Rock cruise in 2018. 2019 saw Shortino singing and playing lead guitar for Carlos Cavazo's Rough Riot and Alford and Hager began auditioning to complete the Rough Cutt line-up. After hiring vocalist Steven St. James, whom Hager had previously played with in Sarge in his pre-Rough Cutt days, the band added Buehner and then Housholder. After three rehearsals, the new Rough Cutt played its first live show as a band opening for L.A. Guns featuring Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis in Portland, Oregon at the Bossanova Ballroom on Black Friday, November 29, 2019. Rough Cutt closed its 10-song set by playing \\"You Wanna Be A Star,\\" a song written by Hager, St. James, and Alford. According to Alford in an interview after the performance, the song aired on an episode of the 1980s television series Fame (1982 TV series), and has not been played live by Rough Cutt since the 1980s when arena audiences of the time failed to appreciate it. Rough Cutt is currently writing and recording new music and is in negotiations with an unnamed record label. Former Rough Cutt bassist Matt Thorne most recently played rhythm guitar with the band Platinum Overdose whose debut album, Murder In High Heels, was released on the Demon Doll label in August 2019. ==Line-upsMk. 1 (1982-1983)=== * Paul Shortino: Lead vocals * Jake E.

SIGCSE is also the name of one of the four annual conferences organized by SIGCSE. The main focus of SIGCSE is higher education, and discussions include improving computer science education at high school level and below. The membership level has held steady at around 3300 members for several years. The current chair of SIGCSE is Adrienne Decker for July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2022. ==Conferences== SIGCSE has four annual conferences. # The SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education is held in the United States with an average annual attendance of approximately 1800 in recent years. The next conference will be held March 11 through March 14, 2020 in Portland, Oregon. # The annual conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). The next ITiCSE will be held June 15-19 in Trondheim, Norway. This conference is attended by about 200-300 and is mainly held in Europe, but has also been held in countries outside of Europe (Turkey - 2010), (Israel - 2012), and (Peru - 2016). # The International Computing Education Research (ICER) conference. This conference has about 70 attendees and is held in the United States every other year. On the alternate years it rotates between Europe and Australasia. The next conference will be held August 10-12, 2020 in Dunedin, New Zealand. # The ACM Global Computing Education (CompEd) conference. This conference will be held at locations outside of the typical North American and European locations. The first annual conference was held in Chengdu, China between the 17th and 19th of May 2019. ==Newsletter/Bulletin== The SIGCSE Bulletin is a quarterly newsletter that was first published in 1969. It evolved from an informal gathering of news and ideas to a venue for columns, editor-reviewed articles, research announcements, editorials, symposium proceedings, etc. In 2010, with the inception of ACM Inroads magazine, the Bulletin was transformed into an electronic newsletter sent to all SIGCSE members providing communications about SIGCSE: announcing activities, publicizing events, and highlighting topics of interest. In other words, it has returned to its roots. ==Awards== SIGCSE has two main awards that are given out annually. ===Outstanding Contribution Award=== The SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education is given annually since 1981. ===Lifetime Service Award=== The SIGCSE Life Service to Computer Science Education has been awarded annually since 1997. ==SIGCSE Board== The current SIGCSE Board for July 1, 2019 – June 30, 2022 is: * Adrienne Decker, Chair *Amber Settle, Past Chair * Dan Garcia, Vice-Chair * Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Treasurer * Leo Porter, Secretary * Mary Anne Egan, at- large member * Laurie Murphy, at-large member * Manuel Perez-Quinones, at- large member SIGCSE Chairs over the years: * Amber Settle, 2016-19 * Susan H.

She had chart successes in the 1960s with her best known songs, \\"Terry\\" and \\"Golden Lights\\". ==Early life== Born in Surbiton, Surrey into a well-to-do family, Ripley was known to her family as \\"Twinkle\\". She attended Queen's Gate School with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and was the aunt of actress Fay Ripley.\\"Sixties Pop Star Lynn 'Twinkle' Ripley Has Died, Aged 66\\" Retrieved 11 August 2015 ==Career== Twinkle owed her rapid entry into the recording studio at the age of 16 to her then-boyfriend, Dec Cluskey, of the popular vocal group The Bachelors, who was introduced to her by her sister, music journalist Dawn James, and who passed on to his manager a demo that Twinkle's father played to him. Her song \\"Terry\\" was a teenage tragedy song about the death of a boyfriend in a motorcycle crash. Big Jim Sullivan, Jimmy Page and Bobby Graham were among the high- profile star session musicians who played on the recording, which conjured up a dark mood with its doleful backing vocals, spooky organ, 12-string guitar and slow, emphatic rhythm arranged by Phil Coulter. The theme was of a common type for the era, it bore some similarities to the Shangri-Las' slightly earlier \\"Leader of the Pack\\" (1964), but the record caused a furore, accusations of bad taste leading to a ban from the BBC. The follow-up, \\"Golden Lights\\", was also written by Twinkle, with a B-side again by producer Tommy Scott. By then Cluskey was her ex-boyfriend: Twinkle dated Peter Noone in 1965. The lyrics express disillusionment with the pop business: her EP track \\"A Lonely Singing Doll\\", the English-language version of France Gall's 1965 winning Eurovision Song Contest song for Luxembourg, \\"Poupée de cire, poupée de son\\", originally written by Serge Gainsbourg, returned to a theme similar to \\"Golden Lights\\". \\"Johnny\\" continued to explore dangerous territory, this time that of a childhood friend who becomes a criminal, but it seems the pressure to produce \\"another Terry\\" led her producers to pass over her own material, for \\"Tommy\\", a song written for Reparata and the Delrons and \\"The End of the World\\" a tune composed for Skeeter Davis. Twinkle made few live appearances but performed \\"Terry\\" at the annual New Musical Express hit concerts. After recording six singles for Decca Records she \\"retired\\" at the age of eighteen in 1966. In 1969 she recorded a self-written single, the Tamla Motown-styled \\"Micky\\", backed by \\"Darby and Joan\\", both produced by Mike d'Abo (also among the relatively few pop musicians of a privileged background in that era) for the Immediate label. The single vanished, unpublicised. In the ensuing years, unsigned and working in music for advertising, she recorded a suite of songs inspired by her relationship with \\"Micky\\", the actor/model Michael Hannah, who was killed in an air-crash in 1974. These remained unreleased until they were included on CD compilations. Her later recordings appeared under the name Twinkle Ripley. She recorded a 1975 single, \\"Smoochie\\" with her father, Sidney Ripley as \\"Bill & Coo\\". In the 1980s \\"Golden Lights\\" was covered by The Smiths and appeared on their compilation albums The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs while in 1983 Cindy & The Saffrons covered \\"Terry\\". Photographic publicity portraits of Twinkle taken in the mid-1960s are exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery. ==Personal life== In 1972, she married actor-model Graham Rogers, who starred in the Milk Tray chocolate adverts.

The name was one of Srimati Radharani's 1000 names. ==Early life== He was born Philippe Barbier Saint-Hilaire in Paris. In 1914 he graduated from the Ècole Polytechnique with a degree in Engineering. He served in the army in World War I as an artillery officer, and after the war worked as a junior engineer in Paris, at the Ministry of transport and communication. ==Quest== He was interested in occultism, and in 1920 departed for Japan to study Zen Buddhism. In 1924 he left Japan and spend time with tantric lamas in monasteries in North China and Mongolia. In 1925 Saint-Hilaire came to India and met Sri Aurobindo and The Mother in Pondicherry, where he was accepted as a sadhak, and Sri Aurobindo gave him the name Pavitra meaning \\"Pure\\". In 1951 The Mother appointed him director of the newly founded Sri Aurobindo International University Centre. He served in this position for 18 years, as well as being general secretary of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, until his death in 1969. ==Death== The Mother reports in Agenda of May 1969 link that Pavitra left his body in a yogic way and merged with her. According to Satprem (see note to \\"On Pavitra and Pavitra's Death\\"), Pavitra left memoirs of his conversations with Sri Aurobindo and Mother in 1925 and 1926, large parts of which were destroyed (almost a third of Pavitra's notebooks) by his closest collaborator, with the pretext that it would be \\"better left unsaid\\".

He also worked with Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott, co-writing on his solo albums. ==Early life== Bain was born in Newtonmore, Badenoch and Strathspey, Highland, and played in several provincial amateur bands as a young teen. His parents and younger brothers relocated to Vancouver. By this point, he was playing professionally in Street Noise. However, he did join his family for a brief stay in Canada. Before returning to Scotland, getting his band Harlot and then hitting the London music scene, Bain joined Harlot in early 1974, after turning down a job with The Babys. ==CareerEarly career=== Bain was asked to join Rainbow after Ritchie Blackmore had watched him performing at The Marquee in London. He recorded the studio album Rising with them and played on their following world tour. While on the tour, he played on Rainbow's first live album, On Stage. In January 1977, Bain was sacked from the band. He then toured Europe with John Cale. ===Wild Horses=== In 1978, Bain formed a band called Wild Horses. Jimmy was the lead vocalist, songwriter, as well as bassist for the band, which also included ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson, drummer Clive Edwards (Pat Travers, Uli Jon Roth's Electric Sun) and guitarist Neil Carter (who went on to UFO and Gary Moore). Wild Horses released two albums on EMI in Europe, Wild Horses (1980) and Stand Your Ground (1981), the latter featuring John Lockton (ex-The Next Band) in place of Carter, before Robertson and Edwards both left in June 1981. Robertson joined Motörhead the following year while Edwards joined former Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden's S.O.S. Bain regrouped Wild Horses as a five-piece with ex-Lautrec members Reuben Archer (vocals) and Laurence Archer (guitar), and The Next Band's Frank Noon (drums), but they disbanded shortly after. Jimmy then worked with the former Family main-man Roger Chapman, Roy Harper, Gary Moore, and Kate Bush (on 1982's The Dreaming). Bain co-wrote with his close friend Phil Lynott for the Lizzy man's two solo albums. A keyboard player as well as a bassist, he toured the material playing keyboards with Lynott's band. Their song, \\"Old Town\\" was re-recorded by The Corrs in 1999, and became a big hit worldwide. He was secretly brought in by the German hard rockers Scorpions to play bass guitar on their 1984 album Love at First Sting. The leader of the band, rhythm guitarist Rudolf Schenker, wanted him to join the Scorpions as full-time bassist, but their management wanted to keep the line-up German, so Francis Buchholz was brought back and Bain's bass tapes were deleted. ===Dio=== In 1983, Bain linked up again with ex-Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio for the band Dio. A central figure within Dio, Bain co-wrote \\"Rainbow in the Dark\\", \\"Holy Diver\\" and two additional songs which appear on their 1983 released first album, Holy Diver. Bain co-wrote several other songs for the following albums, The Last in Line (1984), Sacred Heart (1985), Intermission (1986), Dream Evil (1987) and Killing the Dragon (2002). In the mid-1980s, when the entertainment community became active in drawing attention to world charities, Bain founded Hear 'n Aid, a foundation in which he could involve the rock community to help eliminate world hunger. He also co-wrote the song, \\"Stars,\\" with Vivian Campbell and Ronnie James Dio, which became the Heavy Rock world's answer to \\"We Are The World\\". \\"Stars\\" provided a major contribution to the famine relief charity appeal. Bain donated all of his shares of the proceeds to one of his favourite charities, Children of the Night. In autumn 1989, Bain formed a band with vocalist Mandy Lion called World War III, but after their 1990 eponymous debut album, the band floundered. Bain's solo project The Key utilised a far more melodic and commercial approach. Guitarist on the project was Tracy G, borrowed from Dio's band, who was also the guitarist for World War III. Ronnie James Dio's concept project Magica (2000) saw Bain's return to the Dio lineup, and he played on the albums Magica and Killing the Dragon. In 2005, Bain again joined forces with former Black Sabbath and Dio drummer, Vinny Appice, for two projects, The Hollywood All Starz and 3 Legged Dogg. While the Hollywood All Starz performed live concerts featuring greatest hits sets of the individual members, (Carlos Cavazo of Quiet Riot was another notable member of the band), 3 Legged Dogg produced a well received album of original material. In an interview with journalist, David Lee Wilson, Bain lamented Appice's ultimate choice to leave both these groups so that he could tour with Ronnie James Dio in the Black Sabbath offshoot, Heaven and Hell. ===Later career=== Bain toured with Hollywood Allstarz, a supergroup featuring a number of 1980s metal stars. The group has included former members of Giuffria, Quiet Riot, and Lynch Mob. The band Last in Line was put together in 2013 comprising Bain, Viv Campbell, Vinny Appice, Claude Schnell and Andrew Freeman. That line-up (excluding singer Freeman) were the original songwriters and performers on the early classic Dio albums, and so intended to play gigs and to perform those songs. Bain was in court-mandated rehabilitation during the recording sessions for their album Heavy Crown with a curfew that ordered that he return daily before 10 p.m. ==Personal life== In 1979, Bain married Lady Sophia Crichton-Stewart, daughter of the 6th Marquess of Bute. They had one daughter, Samantha Ella Bain, born in 1981 (for whom Phil Lynott and John Sykes' song \\"Samantha\\" was written). ==Death== On 23 January 2016, Jimmy Bain died while in his cabin on Def Leppard's \\"Hysteria on the High Seas\\" cruise. He was due to perform on the cruise with his group Last In Line the following day. The performance did not go ahead, and band members informed fans on the cruise that he had been battling pneumonia for some time. The cause of death was determined to be lung cancer. Bain had not been diagnosed with cancer and was aware only of his pneumonia. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills), not far from his bandmate Ronnie James Dio. ==DiscographyWith Rainbow=== * Rising (1976) * On Stage (1977) * Live in Germany (1990, recorded September 1976) ===With Mike Montgomery=== * Solo (1976) ===With David Kubinec=== * Some Things Never Change (1978) ===With Thin Lizzy=== * Black Rose: A Rock Legend (1979) ===With Phil Lynott=== *Solo in Soho (1980) *The Philip Lynott Album (1982) ===With Wild Horses=== * Wild Horses (1980) * Stand Your Ground (1981) ===With Gary Moore=== * Dirty Fingers (1983) ===With Dio=== * Holy Diver (1983) * The Last in Line (1984) * Sacred Heart (1985) * Intermission (1986) * Dream Evil (1987) * Magica (2000) * Killing the Dragon (2002) ===With World War III=== * World War III (1991) ===With 3 Legged Dogg=== * Frozen Summer (2006) ===With Last in Line=== * Heavy Crown (2016) ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1947 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Badenoch and Strathspey Category:Scottish heavy metal bass guitarists Category:Scottish bass guitarists Category:Rainbow (rock band) members Category:Wild Horses (British band) members Category:Dio (band) members Category:The Gary Moore Band members Category:Scottish songwriters Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Florida ","title":"Jimmy Bain"},{"id":"1999772","text":"A cross is the decoration located at the highest level of a crown on top of the monde.

While many early crowns were uncovered circlets (and some European crowns continue to have this form (see e.g. the Danish crown), from the late Middle Ages onward it became traditional to enclose the crown in a head-covering or cap, in part due to the drafty nature of the cathedrals, castles, palaces and halls where crowns were worn.

Founded at the mouth of the Vaza-Barris River on January 1, 1590, the municipality is the fourth oldest settlement in Brazil. São Cristóvão is noted for its historic city square, São Francisco Square, and numerous early colonial-period buildings. The site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. São Cristóvão covers , making it the third largest settlement in the state of Sergipe behind Aracaju and Nossa Senhora do Socorro. Its population is 85,814 (est. 2014) and has a population density of 196.43 per km2 (508.8/sq mi). São Cristóvão is home to the Federal University of Sergipe, which was established in 1968. ==History== Church in São Cristóvão São Cristóvão was established by the Portuguese (in a time when Portugal, Spain and the Naples kingdoms were under the rule of Philip II of Spain) as one of the first colonization attempts in Sergipe, which makes the city the fourth oldest one in Brazil. In 1590 the Portuguese sent Cristóvão de Barros to both subjugate the region to colonial rule and establish a safe trading port between Salvador and Pernambuco. De Barros quickly and violently defeated the local population, which consisted of people of mixed Tupinambá and French heritage who maintained a trade in Brazilwood. As a symbol of his victory De Barros founded a small village named for his patron saint, Saint Christopher. The development of the town followed the Portuguese urban model, that is, in two plans: the higher town, where the headquarters of the civil and religious powers are; and lower town, with the harbour, the factories, and the low income population. The economy of São Cristóvão initially depended on the establishment of cattle herds for meat, milk, and leather. The settlement was completely destroyed by the Dutch in 1637. Tobacco and sugarcane plantations were established in the 17th century, and remained into the modern period. São Cristóvão was the state capital until 1855, when the provincial president Inácio Joaquim Barbosa moved the capital to Aracaju. In 1967, the city was designated a national monument to preserve its colonial architecture, and it is now home to ten national heritage sites of Brazil. Among the important sacred buildings are the Church and Convent of Santa Cruz (also known as the Church and Convent of São Francisco, which date from 1693), the Misericórdia Hospital and Church (Santa Casa de Misericordia, the 17th-century Sisters of Mercy hospital), the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (1751), the Parish Church of Our Lady of Victory (1608) and several other important churches from the 18th century, including the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men, the Church of Our Lady of Protection, and the Monastery of São Bento. Ten national or state heritage sites are located in or near the city center; two, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception of Engenho Poxim and the Church of Our Lady of Nazareth of Engenho Itaperoá, are abandoned and on sugarcane plantations far from the city center. The religious sites of São Cristóvão remain an important center of Roman Catholic pilgrimage in Brazil. The Museum of Sacred Art of the Church and Convent of São Francisco is considered the third most important in Brazil. ==São Francisco Square== São Francisco Square (Praça São Francisco) is an open space surrounded by colonial-period buildings such as the São Francisco Church and convent, the Church and Santa Casa da Misericórdia, the Provincial Palace and other buildings from later periods. The complex is a well-preserved example of typical Franciscan architecture of north-eastern Brazil. On August 1, 2010 the site, which covers , was selected as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is managed by a regional office of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) and the municipal government. ==Historic structures== Churches *Church and Convent of Santa Cruz, or Convent of Saint Francis and the Church of the Good Jesus of Glory, now the Sacred Art Museum () *Misericórdia Hospital and Church () *Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men ( *Church of Our Lady of Protection of the Mulattoes () *Church and Convent of Mount Carmel () *Church of the Third Order of Mount Carmel () *Parish Church of Our Lady of Victory () Residences *Sobrado at Rua Castro Alves, 2 () *Sobrado at Rua da Matriz () *Sobrado at Rua das Flores () Rural chapels *Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception of Engenho Poxim () *Church of Our Lady of Nazareth of Engenho Itaperoá () ==Economy== The city is a shipping port, and its main industries are sugar milling and distilling. ==ReferencesExternal Links== Category:Populated places established in 1590 Category:1590 establishments in Brazil Category:Municipalities in Sergipe Category:Populated coastal places in Sergipe Category:National heritage sites of Sergipe ","title":"São Cristóvão"},{"id":"1999784","text":"Michael Theodore Jagosz (December 13, 1965 – March 9, 2014) was an American singer and musician and one of the founding members of L.A.

His family believed that he became depressed after leaving Guns N' Roses in 1985 and was heavily abusing drugs before returning to Denmark in 1988. Heroin, and a blood alcohol content of .148, are thought to have contributed to his drowning, but his family still believes it was suicide. Beich is buried in Esbjerg next to his father Aksel, who died in 1995. ==Discography== ;with Rock Nalle & The Flames * Rock 'N'alle Roll (1979) ;with L.A.

Rochester Post-Bulletin February 28, 1996 p3A The school's name was selected after a contentious process that began with a citizen's committee of 80 people who started with 204 names. After a five-hour meeting they settled on two possible names, Eleanor Roosevelt and Century. Century referred to the Cassidy farm which had been in the same family for over 100 years. Eleanor Roosevelt is a former first lady who was in the news in 1996 after remarks by Hillary Clinton. The two names were forwarded to the School Board for the final decision.Rochester Post-Bulletin April 9, 1996 p1A Rochester was still a conservative community with many citizens not interested in selecting a liberal figure. An informal poll by the local newspaper showed a 2 to 1 preference for Century. Rochester Post-Bulletin April 11, 1996 p2B After a forty-minute debate by the School Board, the members voted 4 to 3 for Century, citing a poll by elementary and junior-high students that showed a clear preference for that name. The students also selected the school's mascot, colors, and fight song. Rochester Post-Bulletin May 8, 1996 p1A The construction of the school was supported by a voter-approved bond of $37.3 million. The school was completed and opened in 1997 as a school for 9th and 10th grade students. 11th and 12th grade students were included in subsequent years. Students ate in the forum until 1998 when construction of the school cafeteria was completed.

It was first shown on BBC1 on 26 January 1975. It was filmed in 1974 when Bowie was struggling with cocaine addiction, and the documentary has become notable for showing his mental state during this period. ==Content== The documentary depicts Bowie on tour in Los Angeles, using a mixture of documentary sequences filmed in limousines and hotels, and concert footage. Most of the concert footage was taken from a show at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre on 2 September 1974. There were also excerpts from D. A. Pennebaker's concert film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which had been shot at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973, as well as a few other performances from the tour. Cracked Actor is notable for being a source for footage of Bowie's ambitious Diamond Dogs Tour. ==Production== The title of the documentary was originally to be The Collector, after a comment that Bowie had made to interviewer Russell Harty the previous year, whereby he described himself as \\"a collector of accents\\". Yentob and his team were given the task of documenting Bowie's famous Diamond Dogs tour, which was already underway when they started filming. Locations for the documentary mainly centred on Hollywood and Los Angeles, but there was also concert footage taken from Philadelphia. A number of performances from the tour were shown, including the songs \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Cracked Actor\\", \\"Sweet Thing/Candidate\\", \\"Moonage Daydream\\", \\"The Width of a Circle\\", \\"Aladdin Sane\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Diamond Dogs\\" and \\"John, I'm Only Dancing (Again)\\". ==Legacy== The tour and film coincided with a prolific time in Bowie's recording and acting career. During the summer of 1974, Bowie started recording at Sigma Studios Philadelphia for what became the Young Americans LP. After seeing an advanced screening of the film, director Nicolas Roeg immediately contacted Bowie to discuss The Man Who Fell to Earth. Photos from Bowie in the US in 1974 on tour and recording, of which some sequences can be seen in Cracked Actor, have been used elsewhere, including the cover of David Live and inserts for the Rykodisc and anniversary booklets for the CD pressings of the LPs that include \\"Young Americans\\". Biographer Nicholas Pegg calls Cracked Actor \\"arguably the finest documentary made about David Bowie.\\" In 1987, while working on his album Never Let Me Down, Bowie reflected in an interview about his state of mind during the time the film was made: In 2013, Alan Yentob said of the film: \\"I'd caught him at what was an intensely creative time, but it was also physically and emotionally gruelling. Our encounters tended to take place in hotel rooms in the early hours of the morning or in snatched conversations in the back of limousines. He was fragile and exhausted but also prepared to open up and talk in a way he had never really done before.\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/imagine-beyonce- bowie.html ==Commercial status== The documentary remains officially unreleased though there are bootleg video copies circulating as a result of the programme being shown again by the BBC in the early 1990s and more recently in 2007 and 2008. ==ReferencesSources=== * ==External links== * * Category:1975 films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:British documentary films Category:BBC television documentaries Category:Rockumentaries Category:Documentary films about singers Category:David Bowie Category:1975 documentary films ","title":"Cracked Actor"},{"id":"1999805","text":"Heather Paige Dubrow (née Kent; born January 5, 1969) is an American actress and television personality.

It houses the Parliament of Singapore, and is located in the Civic District of the Downtown Core within the Central Area. Within its vicinity is Raffles Place, which lies across from the Parliament House from the Singapore River, and the Supreme Court's building across the road. The building was designed to represent a contemporary architectural expression of stateliness and authority. The prism-shaped top, designed by former president Ong Teng Cheong, was similarly a modernist take on the traditional dome. ==Planning and construction== The space constraints faced by the Old Parliament House were felt since the early 1980s, when the members of parliament grew from 51 in 1963 to 75 in 1983, a point made by then Leader of the House, Edmund William Barker during a parliamentary debate on 16 March 1983. The old building had been renovated several times to accommodate the demand for space, but there was a limit as to how much the building could be widened without disrupting the Chamber's configuration and causing discomfort to its members. The debate concluded in 1989, when the First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed the idea to build a new parliament house. The project started in earnest in May 1989, when a project team was formed to design and build the new house. Headed by Liu Thai Ker, CEO and Chief Planner of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), it comprised architects and engineers from the URA and the Public Works Department (PWD). Various designs were put forth by PWD architects for the new site next to the existing parliament house, led by PWD Director Chua Hua Meng and Deputy Director Lee Kut Cheung. In 1992, the project was approved by the government with a budget of S$148.2 million. The following year, the Committee on the Parliament Complex Development Project was established, headed by the Speaker of Parliament Tan Soo Khoon, and with Wong Kan Seng, Lee Boon Yang, and Lim Hng Kiang as its members. Tasked to liaise with architects in the planning and construction of the building, the committee members also went on two overseas study missions to gather ideas to be incorporated into the building's design. The first trip was made to Australia, where visits were made to the newly built Parliament House in Canberra. Here, extensive attention was paid to public education of the parliamentary system in the form of galleries, moot parliaments. A second visit was made to Europe, to incorporate contrasting older, traditional ideas into the building's design. With these ideas incorporated, the new building's concept plan was approved by the Cabinet in 1994. Construction began in 1995 on the expunged Hallpike Street under the direction of PWD Director Chua Hua Meng and Deputy Director Tan Chee Wee, and was completed in July 1999 at a cost of S$115.2 million. On 6 September 1999, the flag of Singapore was lowered for the last time at the old Parliament House, before the ceremonial \\"walk over\\" was conducted from the old building to the new. Led by the Speaker of Parliament and the Prime Minister, the entourage of MPs walked along Parliament Place, a renamed segment of High Street, Singapore, before reaching the new Parliament House where the flag was unfurled and hoisted with the national anthem being played. The entourage then filed into the new Chamber, where the parliamentary debate resumed. On 4 October 1999, the building was officially opened with a simple ceremony held at the building's foyer, where a stainless steel plaque was unveiled before 100 MPs and invited guests. ==Architecture== The new Parliament House was designed by the Public Works Department, and comprises three new blocks (Chamber Block, Front Block and Public Block) integrated with an existing restored building built in 1864 and which once housed the Attorney-General's Chambers. This block was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992. The building was built not only as a venue for parliamentary debates, but also a research centre and meeting place for the members of parliament (MPs), as well as a place of interest for students and the general public. Due to its setting in the richly historical area, the building's overall design harks back to its more historical neighbours with its slate grey external colour scheme and liberal use of accentuated columns reflective of the colonnade design common in classical architecture. The main entrance from North Bridge Road is preceded by a grand ceremonial driveway flanked by palm trees, an iconic tree peculiar to the tropical region and complemented by fountain pools. The building's grand foyer is topped by the timber atrium, seen from the outside as the building's signature prism-shaped pinnacle. With 100 seats and room for 20 more, the new Chamber features contemporary IT features like an electronic voting system, an integrated congress system, IT terminals and so on. Generous space is devoted to the Strangers' Gallery and the Press Gallery, allowing for more members of the public to observe proceedings. In addition, a new sound-proofed Educational Gallery was built on the top floor of the chamber allowing for staff and teachers to verbally explain live parliamentary proceedings to students, as well as a moot parliament, history corner, and multimedia information kiosks to provide a full educational programme, as is the case in the Parliament House in Canberra. Also part of the new building are a 170-seat auditorium, a library, range of meeting and IT rooms and media facilities, a dining room, a 100-seat public cafeteria and even a gymnasium. Car parking is available below ground, leaving much valuable space above to include lush landscaping and a 2,770 square metre garden.

Guns. The Chance Theater, Poughkeepsie, New York. March 2008. Philip Francis Lewis (born 9 January 1957) is the English vocalist for the American hard rock band L.A. Guns. He was born on 9 January 1957 in London, England. He has lived and worked in the U.S. since the 1980s but was privately educated at Royal Russell School in Surrey, England. ==Early work== Lewis started the band Girl with guitarist Gerry Laffy in 1978. They put an advertyisement in Melody Maker for a \\"peroxide guitar hero,\\" and Phil Collen (current guitarist of Def Leppard) answered. They were soon joined by drummer Dave Gaynor and bassist Mark Megary. Megary was replaced shortly thereafter by Laffy's brother, Simon Laffy. They signed a record deal with Don Arden’s label, Jet Records in 1979 and released their first album, Sheer Greed, in 1980. Lewis's then girlfriend, Britt Ekland, was instrumental in helping Girl land their record deal. Later band members included Pete Barnacle, Bryson Graham, and Pete Bonas. They released their second album, Wasted Youth in 1982. Phil Collen left the band in 1982 to join Def Leppard, and the band broke up shortly thereafter. Their third and final album, Killing Time, was released in 1997. It consisted of leftover material from the first two albums as well as tracks that were written for an album that never materialized. Lewis later joined forces with guitarist Rudy Rivera, bassist Dave Birch, and drummer Paul Edwards to start the band New Torpedos. They released a demo tape. Lewis left New Torpedos to join the band Tormé with guitarist Bernie Tormé. They signed a record deal with Zebra Records and released Back to Babylon in 1986 and Die Pretty, Die Young in 1987. They toured both albums with modest success but never quite managed win over mainstream audiences. ==L.A. Guns== Shortly after leaving Tormé, Lewis received a call from guitarist Tracii Guns stating that he was interested in having Phil join his band, L.A. Guns. The two met on 1 April 1987, and Lewis was hired shortly thereafter. L.A. Guns soon signed a record deal with Polygram Records and released their first album, L.A. Guns, on 4 January 1988. The band achieved mainstream success with their second album, Cocked & Loaded, thanks in part due to the successful single, \\"The Ballad of Jayne.\\" They released Hollywood Vampires in 1991, which also had moderate success. Due to the rise in popularity of the grunge movement, the band would not release their fourth album, Vicious Circle until 1994. That album did not achieve the success of the prior albums, so Lewis left the band shortly after its release. During his time out of L.A. Guns, Lewis participated in several other music projects including Filthy Lucre with Steve Dior and the Liberators. Filthy Lucre released an album called Popsmear in 1997. During this time, he also held various other jobs including producing albums for other artists, mixing audio for Fox Sports, and even working as a telephone psychic for a short time. Lewis returned to L.A. Guns in 1999. The classic lineup released a re- recorded version of the hit album Cocked and Loaded in 2000. This updated version was called Cocked & Re-Loaded. The band released a new album entitled Man In The Moon in 2001. They released Waking The Dead in April 2002. It was the first album with producer Andy Johns and would also prove to be the last with Tracii Guns, as he left the band a few months later to team up with Nikki Sixx for the band Brides of Destruction. Guns’ departure forced the band to pull out of a world tour with Alice Cooper, and they were soon dropped from their label as well. Lewis and drummer Steve Riley continued to tour as L.A. Guns after Tracii Guns’ departure and have released two more original albums, Tales from the Strip in 2005 and Hollywood Forever in 2012. In December 2016, Lewis announced that he would be leaving the current lineup of L.A. Guns. He also announced that he will be joining Tracii Guns in a new L.A. Guns lineup. The new lineup consists of Phil Lewis, Tracii Guns, Michael Grant, Johnny Martin, and Shane Fitzgibbon. They released a new album together called “The Missing Peace” on October 13, 2017. As of March 2018, Michael Grant left L.A. Guns. Lewis currently resides in Las Vegas, Nevada with his wife, the artist Kahla Walkowski. He was previously married to Junko Lewis. Both Kahla and Junko feature in the music video \\"You Better Not Love Me,\\" from the 2012 L.A. Guns album Hollywood Forever. Lewis is a contributor to the 80s metal music website \\"Metal Sludge\\", under the online handle \\"Al Snug\\". ==Tribute albums== Lewis sang on a cover of Def Leppard's \\"Bringin' on the Heartbreak\\" on the Def Leppard tribute album Leppardmania. He also sang on a cover of Guns N' Roses's \\"My Michelle\\" on the Guns N' Roses tribute album Appetite for Reconstruction, and he contributed vocals on \\"Shot Down In Flames\\" for the AC/DC tribute album We Salute You: an All Star Tribute To AC/DC. Lewis recorded a cover of Kiss' \\"Strutter\\" on the Kiss tribute album Spin The Bottle, sang on \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" on the Alice Cooper tribute Humanary Stew, and contributed vocals to a cover of Bon Jovi's \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" on the Bon Jovi tribute album Covered Dead or Alive. ==Discography== ; With Girl * Sheer Greed (1980) * Wasted Youth (1982) * Killing Time (1997) ; With New Torpedos * New Torpedos demo tape ; With Tormé * Back To Babylon (1986) * Die Pretty, Die Young (1987) ; With L.A.

Linguistically speaking, it is a \\"regiolect\\" or \\"regional vernacular\\" rather than a dialect in the strict sense. Though colloquially called \\"Saxon\\" (), it is not to be confused with the Low Saxon dialect group in Northern Germany. Upper Saxon is closely linked to the Thuringian dialect spoken in the adjacent areas to the west. ==History== The Upper Saxon dialect evolved as a new variety in the course of the medieval German Ostsiedlung (eastern colonisation) from about 1100 onwards. Settlers descending from the stem duchies of Saxony, Franconia, Bavaria as well as Thuringia and Flanders, moved into the Margravate of Meissen between the Elbe and Saale rivers, formerly populated by Polabian Slavs. As the colonists belonged to different German tribes, speaking different dialects, Upper Saxon became an intermediary, koiné dialect (Kolonialdialekt or Ausgleichsdialekt), having less distinct features than the older, more original dialects. Upper Saxon dialect needs to be distinguished from the \\"chancery language\\" of Saxony (Meißner Kanzleisächsisch). This was the official, literary language of the Margravate of Meissen (respectively the Electorate of Saxony after 1423), replacing Latin as the language of administrators during the period of Renaissance humanism (15th to 16th century). It was less influenced by Upper German features than the Habsburg chancery language, and thus intelligible to speakers of both Upper and Low German dialects. In the context of the Bible translation by Martin Luther, it played a large part in the development of the Early New High German language as a standard variety. Due to the influence and prestige of the Electorate of Saxony during the Baroque era (17th to 18th century), and especially its role as a focal point of artists and scientists, the language of the Upper Saxon elite (but not of its ordinary people) was considered the exemplary variant of German during that period. The literary theorist Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700–1766), who spent most of his adult life in Leipzig, considered Saxony's upper-class speech as the guiding form of standard German. When Johann Christoph Adelung (1732–1806) published his High German dictionary (Grammatisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der hochdeutschen Mundart), he made clear that \\"High German\\"—to him—meant the parlance of educated Upper Saxons. He claimed that the Upper Saxon variety was to the German language what Attic was to Greek and Tuscan to Italian. One motive of the parents of German national poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749–1832; a native of Frankfurt) to send him to study in Leipzig was to adopt a more sophisticated language. With Saxony's loss of political power after the Seven Years' War (1756–63), its dialect lost prestige as well. In 1783, philosopher Johann Erich Biester, residing in the Prussian capital of Berlin, rated the \\"unpleasant singsong\\" and \\"highly peculiar confusion of b and p, of d and t\\"—even among upper-class speakers—\\"very crude\\". According to linguist Beat Siebenhaar, Upper Saxon dialect—defined as a cohesive linguistic system with its own, clear rules for pronunciation, word formation and syntax—became largely extinct during the second half of the 19th to early 20th century. Since then, (Upper) Saxon merely refers to a colloquial, regional variety of Standard German and not a dialect in the proper sense. Spoken by leading communists descending from the Central German industrial area like Walter Ulbricht, the Upper Saxon dialect was commonly perceived as the colloquial language of East Germany by West German citizens and up to today is a subject of numerous stereotype jokes. The mildly derogatory verb sächseln means to speak with a Saxon accent. ==Accent== The most notable distinguishing feature of the dialect is that the letters o and u are pronounced as centralized vowels ( and , respectively, when short; and , respectively, when long). Speakers of other German dialects that do not have these sounds tend to perceive these sounds as being ö and ü respectively. For example, they hear 'grandma' as if written Öma (Standard Oma ). Front rounded vowels are pronounced as non-rounded (ö = , ü = ). Final -er is pronounced (or similarly, depending on the subdialect), which speakers of other German dialects tend to hear as ; e.g. 'higher' (Standard höher) is misheard as if written he(h)o. The Upper Saxon dialects outside the Ore Mountains can be easily recognized by the supposed \\"softening\\" (lenition) of the voiceless stop consonants and . Speakers of other dialects hear these as if they were \\"b\\", \\"d\\" and \\"g\\" respectively. In reality, these are merely non-aspirated versions of the same and , a widespread feature among Central German dialects, as opposed to strongly aspirated , and in dominant German dialects. ==Subgroups== The degree of accent varies from place to place, from a relatively mild accent in the larger cities such as Dresden, Chemnitz or Leipzig to a stronger form in rural areas, depending on the grade of the High German consonant shift: *Meissen dialect, which remained in the former margraviate after the development of the New High German standard variety, spoken from Meissen District and Central Saxony up the Elbe River to Saxon Switzerland including the Dresden metrolect. *North Upper Saxon dialect with stronger Low German features, spoken in Northern Saxony in and around the city of Leipzig, from Torgau and Eilenburg down to Borna, and in the adjacent territory of Saxony-Anhalt up to the Saale River at Weißenfels in the west *Erzgebirgisch, a distinct dialect, is spoken in the villages of the Central Ore Mountains. Until the post-war expulsions it also included the \\"Northwestern Bohemian\\" language in the adjacent Sudetenland territories to the south, today part of the Czech Republic.Ludwig Erich Schmitt (editor): Germanische Dialektologie.

It may refer to the process of adding members to an elite group at the discretion of members of the body, usually to manage opposition and so maintain the stability of the group. Outsiders are ‘co-opted’ by being given a degree of power on the grounds of their elite status, specialist knowledge, or potential ability to threaten essential commitments or goals (\\"formal co-optation\\").\\"Co-optation\\" Dictionary of Sociology, Oxford University Press 1998. In a classic 1979 article for Harvard Business Review, consultants John Kotter and Leonard Schlesinger presented co-optation as a \\"form of manipulation\\" for dealing with employees who are resistant to new management programs: > Co-opting an individual usually involves giving him or her a desirable role > in the design or implementation of the change. Co-opting a group involves > giving one of its leaders, or someone it respects, a key role in the design > or implementation of a change. This is not a form of participation, however, > because the initiators do not want the advice of the co-opted, merely his or > her endorsement.John P. Kotter and Leonard A. Schlesinger, \\"Choosing > Strategies for Change\\" Harvard Business Review Co-optation may take place in many other contexts, such as a technique by a dictatorship to control opposition. Co-optation also refers to the process by which a group subsumes or acculturates a smaller or weaker group with related interests; or, similarly, the process by which one group gains converts from another group by replicating some aspects of it without adopting the full program or ideal (\\"informal co-optation\\"). Co-optation is associated with the cultural tactic of recuperation, and is often understood to be synonymous with it.Kurczynski, Karen Expression as vandalism: Asger Jorn's \\"Modifications\\", in RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics No. 53/54 (Spring–Autumn, 2008), pp. 295–96. Quotation: ==First senseReasons for use=== Two common uses of co-option are firstly, to recruit members who have specific skills or abilities needed by the group which are not available among existing members. Secondly, to fill vacancies which could not be filled by the usual process (normally election), e.g. if suitable candidates appear subsequently. Co-opted members may or may not have the same rights as the elected members of a group (such as the right to vote on motions), depending on the rules of the group. Sociologist William Gamson defined co-optation as \\"challengers gaining access to the public policy process but without achieving actual policy changes.\\" ===Limitations on use=== If a group is elected or appointed based on its members representing specific constituencies, co-option to fill vacancies is inappropriate, as a member selected by existing members will not necessarily represent the interests of the group represented by the vacating member. In this case, vacancies may be filled via a mechanism specified in its rules, such as a by- election. Examples are: * geographical constituencies (as used in legislatures in the United States and United Kingdom) * constituencies of adherents to a political party, known as proportional representation (as used in legislatures in Israel and New Zealand) * ethnic groups (as used in Māori constituencies in the New Zealand legislature) * any other affinity group. ===Nomenclature=== Sociologist Philip Selznick, in the context of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), described this form as \\"formal co-optation\\" (he used the term \\"cooptation\\"). ==Second sense== This is arguably a derivation from the first sense. The outcome of such co-option will be specific to the individual case, and will depend on the relative strength of the co-opting and co-opted groups, the degree of alignment of their interests, and the vigour with which their members are prepared to pursue those interests. For example, when corporations greenwash their brands by co-opting the tone of environmentalism without any deep reform of their environmental impact, both environmental advocates and the general public must decide how to engage (or not) with the greenwashed result (accept it wholly, boycott it, apply pressure from another angle, ignore it, or some other path). Selznick, again in the context of the Tennessee Valley Authority, described this form as \\"informal co-optation\\", although the process he describes is almost indistinguishable from the corrupt sale of political influence. ==See also== *Entryism *Recuperation (politics) ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Elections Category:Political terminology Category:Group processes ","title":"Co-option"},{"id":"1999882","text":"Ieu Koeus () (1905 – 14 January 1950) was a Cambodian politician.

On January 14, 1950, a hand grenade was thrown into the party headquarters, fatally wounding Koeus, who led the National Union Movement.Corfield, Justin. \\"Historical Dictionary of Cambodia\\", p. 168 The man throwing the grenade was captured and arrested, admitting, then later denying, that he was a member of the opposing Liberal party. Blame for the assassination, however, varies from the French, King Sihanouk, Yem Sambaur, and rebel Issaraks with little evidence available.

The song was featured on the Scream 3 soundtrack and in the video game Rock Band 4. ==Music== \\"Spiders\\", like many of System of a Down's songs, is written in the key of C minor. The song relies heavily on the Cm, B♭, and E♭ chords, as well as Fm, Gm, A♭, B, and D♭. \\"Spiders\\" uses 4/4 time at a slow tempo, and employs drum-rolls and syncopation in the verses. The music can be described as haunting, ominous, dark, frightening, and depressing with its dark melody and echoing vocal overdubs. Serj Tankian's vocals, while low and melodic in the verses, become more energetic and dissonant in the refrains. The song's minor-key intro serves as a musical motif for the rest of the song; it repeats throughout the song in its normal and raised third forms. After the second refrain, Daron Malakian delivers a solo bridge that creates harmonic tension with its B and D♭ (non-key) chords. The song ends with a soft vocal version of the intro motif. ==Music video== A music video was directed by Charlie Deaux. Recently, a second version of the video has surfaced on video sharing websites such as YouTube, featuring a more coherent timeline and more footage of the band compared to the other actors. ==Track listingChart positions== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !Chart (1999-2000) !Peak position |- | |- | |} ==ReferencesExternal links== * Song lyrics Category:System of a Down songs Category:1999 singles Category:1998 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Rick Rubin ","title":"Spiders (System of a Down song)"},{"id":"1999888","text":"Guy Favreau, (May 20, 1917 - July 11, 1967) was a Canadian lawyer, politician and judge.

Smith was nicknamed Judge or Judgie for his resemblance to a judge when he grew his hair long.Smith finds right time , BBC Sport, Retrieved 3 May 2009 Like his older brother Chris, he was unable to play for the country of his birth because of the exclusion of the apartheid regime from international cricket, but because he had British parents he qualified to play for England. He played for England in eleven home test series and on six overseas tours from 1988 to 1996. Smith was best known for his abilities against fast bowling, with what was regarded as a trademark square-cut that was hit ferociously. He trained to be a psychologist. ==County career== In county cricket, Smith played for Hampshire, captaining them from 1998 to 2002, before retiring from first-class cricket in 2003. Until Kevin Pietersen (another English cricketer born in South Africa) was signed by Hampshire from Nottinghamshire in 2005, Smith was Hampshire's most successful England batsman since C. B. Fry. ==International careerEarly days=== Smith was born in Durban, South Africa completing his High School education at Northwood School. The School honoured his career achievements by naming the 1st team cricket oval after him. In his first Test at Headingley in 1988, he shared a century partnership with fellow South African-born batsman Allan Lamb. This was one of very few century partnerships for England during the series against the firepower of the West Indies fast bowlers. The following summer, 1989, Smith was the only successful England batsman in the Ashes series making two centuries. In his second hundred at Trent Bridge, he arrived with England already three wickets down chasing 600, and played some powerful shots – particularly off Mervyn Hughes whose bowling figures were, at one point 4–0–38–0. ===Prominence=== His highest test score, 175 against the West Indies in Antigua, was made as England replied to Brian Lara's record-breaking innings of 375. Despite his domination of fast, aggressive bowling, Smith suffered from a well-publicised vulnerability to slower bowlers – particularly the leg-spin of Shane Warne. Smith was one of England's most courageous players. He was targeted by the West Indies at Antigua in 1989–90 with fast short pitched bowling giving him no room for his favourite shots. During that innings, he was hit on the finger (subsequently diagnosed as broken) and hit flush on the jaw by a bouncer from Courtney Walsh – but neither blow forced him to retire hurt. He scored 167 not out for England against Australia in the 1993 Texaco Trophy at Edgbaston, when Australia won by six wickets. This was the highest score made by an England batsman in an ODI (until Alex Hales scored 171 against Pakistan in 2016), and was the highest score made by any batsman who finished on the losing side in such a game (until Charles Coventry scored 194 against Bangladesh in a losing cause). ===Later career=== Despite this, when Smith was dropped from the England team it was popularly perceived as premature, particularly given his Test batting average of over 43. Backing this up is the ICC's historical rankings of Test batsmen, which placed Smith as the 77th greatest batsman in history, and 17th greatest Englishman (ahead of others such as Geoff Boycott, Alec Stewart and Mike Atherton). In 1994, before Smith scored 175 in the fifth and final Test against the West Indies, he was accused by the then England coach Keith Fletcher of 'having too many fingers in too many pies.' ==Post-cricket== After retiring from county cricket at the end of the 2003 season, Smith relocated to Australia to help run helmet manufacturer Masuri. After suffering from mental health problems and anxiety, he currently works for his brother's clothing company and runs his own cricket coaching academy. Smith is also studying for a degree in psychological science at Swinburne University, Melbourne. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1963 births Category:Cricketers at the 1992 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1996 Cricket World Cup Category:England One Day International cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1969 to 2000 Category:Hampshire cricket captains Category:Hampshire cricketers Category:KwaZulu-Natal cricketers Category:Living people Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:South African emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:South African people of English descent Category:Sportspeople from Durban Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Alumni of Northwood School, Durban ","title":"Robin Smith (cricketer)"},{"id":"1999935","text":"Nirodbaran (17 November 1903 - 17 July 2006, Pondicherry) or \\"Nirod\\" for short, was the literary secretary and personal physician to Sri Aurobindo and scribe for SAVITRI: A LEGEND AND A SYMBOL. And senior member of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. == Life == He graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in medicine. He was told about Sri Aurobindo and The Mother by Dilip Kumar Roy while in Paris. In 1930 he visited the Ashram and met the Mother. He then spent 2 or 3 years practising medicine in Burma, but this work failed to satisfy him. He returned to the Ashram with the intention of practising Yoga, and took up work as the resident doctor. He found to his surprise that poetry was one of the vocations taken up by some of the disciples. As Sri Aurobindo had already withdrawn from the public life of the ashram, he communicated with and instructed the sadhaks via letters, and Nirodbaran entered into a voluminous correspondence with Sri Aurobindo (receiving about 4000 letters), who encouraged and guided his attempts at poetry. He published a collection of his poems as Blossom of the Sun and 50 poems by Nirodbaran, which were revised and commented on by Sri Aurobindo. In November 1938 Sri Aurobindo broke his leg and as a physician Nirodbaran was one of the disciples with medical knowledge who attend him while he recuperated. Nirodbaran was born into an aristocratic and distinguished Zamindar family. His close relatives were Rabindranath Tagore, Chittaranjan Das, General Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri and Air Chief Marshal Subroto Mukherjee. Later he had published Talks with Sri Aurobindo (3 volumes), Correspondence with Sri Aurobindo (2 volumes), and his memoir 12 years with Sri Aurobindo, as well as various volumes of poetry and other writings.

The program is hosted primarily by Ian Freeman and Mark Edge, joined frequently by rotating co-hosts. It is a chiefly libertarian anarchist political talk show, with topics ranging from current events to philosophy, and covering both politics and personal issues. Free Talk Live engages in only a very basic form of call screening. The show is broadcast from Keene, New Hampshire. Before moving to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project, the show was broadcast from Sarasota, Florida. It airs from 7 PM to 10 PM (EST). The program is syndicated on over 200 radio stations via the Genesis Communications Network, two television stations across the United States, on a KU-band satellite channel across North America and Africa, and on multiple Internet radio networks around the globe. The nightly shows are alternatively available on the Free Talk Live website through podcast. Archives of more than years of past shows are also available for download in MP3 format from the website. ==History== The first broadcast was on November 3, 2002, from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM in Sarasota, Florida. Free Talk Live became a weeknight show from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM. After the radio station changed format in June 2003, the show was available only on Internet radio until it was picked up by WTMY, an AM radio station in Sarasota. The show began syndication program in September 2004. Free Talk Live currently airs seven nights per week from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM Eastern time on over 120 radio and five television affiliates carrying audio simulcasts. In addition to over-the-air radio/TV, the show broadcasts on several internet radio affiliates and XM Satellite Radio channels 166 and 165, on weekdays and weekends respectively. Free Talk Live won the Podcast Awards’ Best Cultural/Political Podcast Award in 2005 and won the Best Political Podcast Award in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010. The program has been featured in Talkers Magazine's 100 most important radio talk show hosts in America. On June 13, 2011, Ian and Mark announced on air that Free Talk Live would be adding a live Sunday show to replace its rotating internet only show, with plans to syndicate the show to radio stations. The show debuted on the internet on June 19 and has since been syndicated on radio. ==Hosts== * Ian Freeman – Having identified himself as a libertarian, an anarcho- capitalist, a free marketeer, and other labels over the course of the show's history, Freeman has settled on voluntaryist in recent years. Likewise, Freeman's spiritual/religious evolution has brought him from self-proclaimed atheist to his current panentheist beliefs. He hosts the show from the studio within the Shire Free Church in Keene, New Hampshire. On 20 March 2016, Freeman's home was raided by the FBI during a child pornography investigation, but no charges ever materialized.http://www.wcvb.com/news/fbi-raids-radio- talk-show-hosts-home-in-keene-sunday-morning/38613452 * Mark Edge (real name: \\"Mark Edgington\\") – Edge identifies himself as a voluntaryist while expressing support for panarchy. His spiritual/religious evolution over the course of the show has led him to settle on Quakerism with a pantheist bent. He is the ad salesman for Free Talk Live. Mark also hosts the Edgington Post, a short interview show which was tacked onto the end of podcasted versions of FTL until it became a separate podcast. On January 29, 2007, it was revealed that Mark Edge had served nine years in prison for his involvement in the 1988 strangulation murder of a Florida motel manager.Free Talk Live - Mark Edge prison sentenceFree Keene - \\"The Keene Sentinel's Front-Page Article on Mark Edgington ==The show== The hosts repeatedly state that Free Talk Live is your show and that you take control of the air waves. Listeners who call in will only be asked for a name, location, the topic(s) they wish to speak about, and how they listen to the show. It is stated policy that anyone who calls in will get on the air but each listener may only call the show once a day. The hosts also purport that all women who call into the show are moved to the front of the queue. This policy was adopted to make female listenership more visible to station affiliates, and to encourage female participation overall. This is done to dismantle the myth that talk radio is for a male demographic, and also for the increased ad revenue that comes from female listeners. Between listener phone calls, the hosts fall back to topics they are interested in as well as news events suggested by listeners. ===Guests=== The show does not usually feature guests but has had a number of notable guests. *Adam Kokesh, political activist and 2020 presidential candidateFree Talk Live - Adam Kokesh *Aubrey de Grey, author and biomedical gerontologistFree Talk Live - Dr. Aubrey de Grey *Bill Westmiller, chairman of the Republican Liberty CaucusFree Talk Live - Bill Westmiller *Cindy Sheehan, anti-war activist who lost her son in the Iraq WarFree Talk Live - Cindy Sheehan *Danny Ledonne, controversial film director and former video game developerFree Talk Live - Danny Ledonne *Doug Stanhope, stand-up comedian and activistFree Talk Live - Doug Stanhope *Drew Curtis, creator of Fark.comFree Talk Live - Drew Curtis *Gene Ray, self- proclaimed \\"wisest man on earth\\"Free Talk Live - Gene Ray *Glenn \\"Kane\\" Jacobs, professional wrestler and Mayor of Knox County, TennesseeFree Talk Live - Glen Jacobs *Jack Thompson (activist), disbarred attorney known for his view that video games cause violenceFree Talk Live - Jack Thompson *Jim Babka, president of the Downsize DC FoundationFree Talk Live - Jim Babka *Marc Emery, cannabis rights activistCannabis Culture - \\"Marc Emery on 'Free Talk Live' radio *Michael Badnarik, software engineer and 2004 vice-presidential candidate for the Libertarian PartyFree Talk Live - Michael Badnarik *Ron Paul, U.S. Representative, three-time presidential candidate, and authorFree Talk Live - Dr. Ron Paul *Thomas Woods, libertarian author and historianThe Tom Woods Show - \\"Woods Derangement Syndrome\\" *Vermin Supreme, performance artist and perennial candidateFree Talk Live - Vermin Supreme ===Funding=== Funding for Free Talk Live comes from a combination of standard on-the-show advertising, and a donation-by-subscription service known as AMP (an acronym for Advertise, Market, and Promote). An AMP subscriber, or AMPlifier, donates a choice from pre-established amounts of money to the show every month. Any amount can be given with a minimum of five dollars. The show has also been known to accept Bitcoin, Silver, Gold, and Liberty Dollars in lieu of Federal Reserve Notes. The hosts indicate that all funds from the AMP program go to advertising and promoting the show, as well as contributing to the cost of production. Although the hosts earn income through advertising and merchandise sales, all AMP proceeds are used to augment the listener base of the program by increasing the number of markets. , listeners contribute a total of $3,179 per month to the show via the AMP program. ===Host’s name change=== Ian Freeman changed his last name on-air from “Bernard” to “Freeman”. On the September 17, 2008 airing of Gardner Goldsmith's New Hampshire-based talk radio show Ian asked Gardner to refer to him as “Ian Freeman” instead of “Ian Bernard”. ==Politics== The hosts assert that they try to apply the ideals of freedom to their show. The hosts have stated they oppose FCC regulations but still seek to avoid FCC-prohibited speech on their broadcast as it may negatively impact the radio stations that air the show and affront some listeners or trigger the imposition of fines by the FCC against those broadcasters.) The hosts, claiming to adhere to their principles of respecting contract and voluntary agreement, state that adherence to the FCC rules come not at the demands of government agencies but the requests of/or demands by their syndicates. As of March 2009, Free Talk Live has implemented the use of a dump box. A major sponsor of Free Talk Live and a common topic of discussion is the Free State Project, an organization committed to recruiting 20,000 like minded people to move to the state of New Hampshire in search of liberty. Once there, the participants pledge to exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property.http://freestateproject.org/fsn6 Freeman and Edge moved to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project in September 2006. ==Spin-offs== * Liberty Radio Network – A 24/7 streaming audio station featuring other shows in the libertarian vein. * Edgington Post – Mark Edge's interview series. * Puke & the Gang – Former co-hosts \\"Puke\\", Andrew, and Nick started this podcast after being removed from the FTL Sunday show.See http://pukeandthegang.com/about/ ==See alsoReferencesExternal links== * Official web site * YouTube channel * Facebook page Category:American talk radio programs Category:Audio podcasts Category:Anarcho-capitalism Category:2002 radio programme debuts Category:Libertarianism in the United States Category:Libertarian television and radio shows Category:Psychedelic drug advocates Category:2002 establishments in the United States ","title":"Free Talk Live"},{"id":"1999940","text":"Josef Gočár Josef Gočár (13 March 1880 in Semín near Přelouč - 10 September 1945 in Jičín), was a Czech architect, one of the founders of modern architecture in Czechoslovakia. ==Life== Josef Gočár received his early instruction at the State Technical School in Prague.

The double bass is the sub-bass instrument of the orchestral strings family, as it produces the pitches in the lowest register for this family. Sub-bass sounds are the deep, low- register pitched pitches approximately below 60 Hz (C2 in scientific pitch notation) and extending downward to include the lowest frequency humans can hear, assumed at about 20 Hz (E0). In this range, human hearing is not very sensitive, so sounds in this range tend to be felt more than heard. The low E-string on a bass guitar is usually tuned to 41.2 Hz. Sound reinforcement systems and PA systems often use one or more subwoofer loudspeaker cabinets that are specifically designed for amplifying sounds in the sub-bass range. Sounds below sub-bass are called infrasound. ==Hearing and usage== 20 Hz is considered the normal low-frequency limit of human hearing. When pure sine waves are reproduced under ideal conditions and at very high decibels, a human listener will be able to identify tones as low as 12 Hz (G–1). Audio tracks known as bass tests use sub-bass frequencies which are used to test or to demonstrate the capabilities of audio equipment. High-end subwoofers can accurately reproduce sound to about 18 Hz ±2 dB. Sub-bass energy is popular in dance music, where the low frequencies involve energy from the kick drum (bass drum), the bass guitar and electronic synthesizers and drum machines. Particular genres such as house music, drum and bass and dubstep often feature a bassline that consists mainly of sub-bass frequencies. Much experimental music uses sub-bass, in particular drone music, where the majority of the sound can often be in the sub-bass range. Often, hip hop and rap songs feature prevalent sub-bass. The pedal keyboard range on pipe organs also often extends into the sub-bass range; the bottom note of a 16′ stop is typically tuned to 32 Hz (C1), a 32′ stop at 16 Hz (C0). ==References== Category:Bass (sound) Category:Pitch (music) ","title":"Sub-bass"},{"id":"1999950","text":"Ernst Filip Oskar Lundberg (2 June 1876 - 31 December 1965) Swedish actuary, and mathematician. Lundberg is one of the founders of mathematical risk theory and worked as managing director of several insurance companies. According to Harald Cramér, \\"Filip Lundberg's works on risk theory were all written at a time when no general theory of stochastic processes existed, and when collective reinsurance methods, in the present sense of the word, were entirely unknown to insurance companies. In both respects his ideas were far ahead of their time, and his works deserve to be generally recognized as pioneering works of fundamental importance.\\" == Biography == Born in 1876, Filip Lundberg's father, Philip Lundberg, was a school teacher in mathematics who died just three months after Lundberg was born. Filip's first ambition was to follow his father's career in mathematics. He studied mathematics at the University of Uppsala, graduating in 1896 and receiving his Licentiate in 1898. However, instead of becoming a teacher, Filip joined a newly founded insurance company. In 1903, Lundberg went on to defend his doctoral thesis on the probability and collective risk. He soon moved to a second company where he was appointed actuary and, at the age of 28, became its managing director. From 1904 to the 1930s, Lundberg's activities were divided between his everyday life and trying to understand the relationship between the concepts 'collective' and 'risk'. Lundberg's results are described in his academic publications between the years 1909 and 1930. His major works on the ruin problem were published in 1926 and 1928. From 1910 on, he was a leading voice in debates about the life insurance industry and a prolific writer and debater. Lundberg advocated a cautious approach to the insurance business which emphasized consolidation before expansion. Lundberg went on to become a leader of the industry, managing other companies, serving as chairman of the Association of Swedish Life Insurance Companies for ten years, and sitting on government committees on insurance. Filip Lundberg left his last position within Swedish insurance, as chairman of the board of Eir, in the same year that his collective risk theory was definitively clarified. Filip Lundberg died in 1965. == Work == In parallel to his business career, Lundberg worked on a theory of collective risk. In 1903, he finished his doctoral thesis, Approximations of the Probability Function/Reinsurance of Collective Risks. This introduced the compound Poisson process and involved work on the central limit theorem. Cramér writes that the thesis has a reputation for being impossible to understand but, that looked at now, \\"one cannot help being struck by his ability to deal intuitively with concepts and methods that would have to wait another thirty years before being put on a rigorous foundation.\\" Cramér mentions later work by Andrey Kolmogorov and William Feller but it was Cramér himself who developed Lundberg's ideas on risk and linked them to the emerging theory of stochastic processes. Focardi & Fabozzi describes Lundberg's thesis as a milestone in actuarial mathematics. It was the first to define a collective theory of risk and to apply a sophisticated probabilistic formulation to the insurance ruin problem. Lundberg’s work anticipated many future developments of probability theory, including what was later to be known as the theory of point processes. Lundberg's theory, together with that of French mathematician Louis Bachelier, was ahead of its time and inspired the subsequent development of probability theory. But the type of mathematics implied by his work could not be employed completely until the development of digital computers. Because he published many of his major works in Swedish, Lundberg's work went unnoticed by the actuarial community for nearly 30 years. However, eventually Lundberg's ideas became known largely through the work of Cramér and his students. Although Lundberg published some work in German, the international scientific language of the time, Lundberg's thesis and most of his subsequent writings were in Swedish. His mathematical language did not travel easily, either. == Discussions == * * K. Englund and A. Martin-Löf (2001) Ernst Filip Oskar Lundberg, Statisticians of the Centuries (ed. C. C. Heyde and E.

He was then the first Governor of Tasmania, from 1855 until 1861. ==Early life== Young was the third son of Sir Aretas William Young, a well-known peninsular officer, and was born at Brabourne, Kent. He was educated at Dean's School, Bromley, Middlesex, and, intended for the bar, entered as a student at the Inner Temple. ==Early career== Young was appointed in 1827 to a position in the colonial treasury in Trinidad, and in 1828 was transferred to Demerara, British Guiana. From 1833, he was involved in the emancipation of slaves in the British Caribbean colonies. In 1834, he was posted briefly to St Lucia as treasurer, secretary and member of the council, and in 1835 returned to British Guiana as government secretary. In 1847, Young returned to London, before he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the Eastern District of the Cape Colony (later the Eastern Cape) in South Africa.C. A. Harris, Young, Sir Henry Edward Fox (1808–1870), rev. Lynn Milne, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006. He was knighted in 1847. ==Governor of South Australia== Young was transferred a few months later to South Australia where he arrived on 1 August 1848 on the Forfarshire. It was hoped that he would be able to announce some measure of responsible government but he had nothing to say on this subject, and it was not until February 1851 that an ordinance was passed constituting a Legislative council of 24 members, of whom eight were nominated by the crown (four officials and four appointed by the governor) and 16 were to be elected. Under Young, South Australia received its first formal parliament. The South Australian House of Assembly comprised 36 members each elected from a different area. It was Governor Young who offered a prize of £2000 in 1851 for the first person to travel up the Murray River to its junction with the Darling River (now the town of Wentworth) in a paddle steamer. The prize was claimed in 1853 by Francis Cadell with his steamer Lady Augusta (named for Sir Henry's wife). Due to the difficulty of navigating the Murray Mouth, Young supported building the railway from the river port of Goolwa to the new sea port at Port Elliot (named after his friend, Charles Elliot). Young was president of the Adelaide Philosophical Society 1853–1854.History of the Royal Society of South Australia Though it was expected sooner or later, the order for his transfer to Van Diemen's Land (today's Tasmania) gave little time for the usual formalities and farewells. ==Governor of Van Diemens Land/Tasmania== Young began his duties in Van Diemens Land in January 1855. Sir Henry Fox Young's term as Governor of Van Diemens Land was significant, because in 1856 the Island colony received self- government, and was renamed Tasmania to mark the fact and as a deliberate measure by free-settlers to distance its convict past. Sir Henry was the first Tasmanian Governor to occupy Government House, Hobart, the beautiful neo- gothic Vice-Regal residence on the banks of the River Derwent. At this time the constitution act was awaiting the royal assent, and the legislative council might wisely have postponed meeting until news of this had been received. It, however, met in July and one of its acts was to form a committee to inquire into the working of the convict department. Dr Hampton, the comptroller-general of convicts, was summoned to appear as a witness and refused to attend. The council decided he was guilty of contempt and arrested him. Hampton served a writ of habeas corpus upon the sergeant-at-arms and the opinion of the law officers of the crown was against the legality of the council's proceedings. Young then attended at the house and prorogued the council until 20 October. The Times severely commented upon Young's conduct, but he was commended by the British government. The Tasmanian supreme court ruled against the council, and when it was taken to the privy council this decision was confirmed. The new constitution was soon successfully instituted and Young welcomed the change in his position, feeling that he was now above the battle and freed from much trying responsibility. He travelled through the island, showed much interest in its development, and capably carried out the work of his office. Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London == Later life== Young left Tasmania on 10 December 1861 for Melbourne, whence he travelled to England and lived in retirement in London until his death there on 18 September 1870. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Youngtown, Tasmania, was named in honour of Young.https://www.placenames.tas.gov.au/ ==Family== Young married Augusta Sophia Marryat (born 1829) in 1848. She was the daughter of a former slaveholder, Charles Marryat, of Potter's Bar, Middlesex, who had been compensated part of £34,000 in the 1830s upon the emancipation of slavery. Augusta (later Lady Young) was the niece of the novelist Captain Frederick Marryat, and sister of Charles Marryat, Dean of Adelaide (1887–1906). Her mother was Caroline Short, whose brother, Augustus Short, was the first Anglican bishop of Adelaide. The couple had four children, two boys and two girls. The town of Port Augusta in South Australia is named after Augusta, as is the tiny suburb of Marryatville in Adelaide's eastern suburbs. Augusta outlived her husband by 43 years, dying in Christchurch, Hampshire in 1913. ==References== Category:1803 births Category:1870 deaths Category:Governors of South Australia Category:Governors of the Colony of South Australia Category:Governors of Tasmania Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:People from Brabourne Category:Burials at Brompton Cemetery Category:Van Diemen's Land people Category:Colony of Tasmania people Category:19th-century Australian public servants ","title":"Henry Young"},{"id":"1999981","text":"Paul Mars Black (born Paul Marmorstein; March 17, 1959) is an American singer and drummer. He is most notable for his time as lead vocalist in L.A. Guns, with whom he wrote most of their self-titled debut album. ==Early Life and Career== Born in San Francisco, California, Black's roots were in bluegrass. In the 1970s, his high school rock band was called Your Mother. He also played in several jazz cover bands. In 1978 he was a percussion major at San Jose State University. Black moved to Los Angeles in May 1980 still using his given name Paul Martin Marmorstein. His first L.A. band was Mad Captions who played CBGB in New York and The Hot Club in Philadelphia with The Dead Boys. In 1981 Paul joined The Mau-Mau's, a Los Angeles-based punk band which was fronted by Rick Wilder of The Berlin Brats. During Paul's time with The Mau-Mau's he shortened his name to Paul Mars. Paul played drums for a Mau-Mau's record produced by Robbie Krieger of The Doors which was never released. In 1984 Paul Mars Joined The Joneses and recorded the drums for Keeping Up With The Joneses. ==L.A. Guns== Black began putting together a side project for his songs to be called Faster Pussycat with guitarist Mick Cripps. Black switched to lead vocals, Cripps switched to bass, and the two joined guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Nickey \\"Beat\\" Alexander and later on guitarist Robert Stoddard to complete this line up. The name was switched to L.A. Guns because the owner of the name, Raz Cue, offered to back the band if this line up would re-use L.A. Guns, a name which had been abandoned over a year prior by a former band of Guns's (Guns N' Roses). Black changed his name again to Paul Black. From 1985 to March 1987 Paul Black wrote and co-wrote a number of songs, which led L.A. Guns to a record deal with Polygram Records. However, Black left before the record was finished and before the deal was signed. Black was replaced by Phil Lewis. After leaving L.A. Guns, Black formed Black Cherry, which quickly became one of the most popular and sought after bands in L.A. But, a lawsuit filed by Black against his former band L.A. Guns and Polygram Records kept Black Cherry from signing a deal. Black retired in 1993 and seldom played shows. In 2000 Black wrote and recorded an album with Jo Almeida of Dogs D'Amour called Jo & Paul's Sonic Boom, Sun Down And Yellow Moon. Two compilation albums of featuring unreleased archive material of Black singing with L.A. Guns, Black City Breakdown (1985-1986) and Black List, as well as Sun Down And Yellow Moon from Jo & Paul's Sonic Boom, were released on his own label Black City Records. From 2006 to 2008, he was the lead singer of Tracii Guns's L.A. Guns, a spinoff band that existed at the same time as Phil Lewis' L.A. Guns. ==DiscographyWith Jo & Paul's Sonic Boom=== *Sun Down And Yellow Moon (2000) ===With L.A.

This zwitterionic metabolite can be found in marine phytoplankton, seaweeds, and some species of terrestrial and aquatic vascular plants. It functions as an osmolyte as well as several other physiological and environmental roles have also been identified. DMSP was first identified in the marine red alga Polysiphonia fastigiata. ==Biosynthesis== In higher plants, DMSP is biosynthesized from S-methylmethionine. Two intermediates in this conversion are dimethylsulfoniumpropylamine and dimethylsulfoniumpropionaldehyde. In algae, however, the biosynthesis starts with the removal of the amino group from methionine, rather than from S-methylmethionine. ==Degradation== DMSP is broken down by marine microbes to form two major volatile sulfur products, each with distinct effects on the environment. One of its breakdown products is methanethiol (CH3SH), which is assimilated by bacteria into protein sulfur. Another volatile breakdown product is dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3; DMS). There is evidence that DMS in seawater can be produced by cleavage of dissolved (extracellular) DMSP by the enzyme DMSP-lyase, although many non-marine species of bacteria convert methanethiol to DMS. DMS is also taken up by marine bacteria, but not as rapidly as methanethiol. Although DMS usually consists of less than 25% of the volatile breakdown products of DMSP, the high reactivity of methanethiol makes the steady-state DMS concentrations in seawater approximately 10 times those of methanethiol (~3 nM vs. ~0.3 nM). Curiously, there have never been any published correlations between the concentrations of DMS and methanethiol. This is probably due to the non-linear abiotic and microbial uptake of methanethiol in seawater, and the comparatively low reactivity of DMS. However, a significant portion of DMS in seawater is oxidized to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Relevant to global climate, DMS is thought to play a role in the Earth's heat budget by decreasing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface. This occurs through degradation of DMS in the atmosphere into hygroscopic compounds that condense water vapor leading to the formation of clouds. DMSP has also been implicated in influencing the taste and odour characteristics of various products. For example, although DMSP is odourless and tasteless, it is accumulated at high levels in some marine herbivores or filter feeders. Increased growth rates, vigour and stress resistance among animals cultivated on such diets have been reported. DMS, is responsible for repellent, 'off' tastes and odours that develop in some seafood products because of the action of bacterial DMSP-lyase, which cogenerates acrylate. ==Further reading== * ==See also== * CLAW hypothesis, proposing a feedback loop that operates between ocean ecosystems and the Earth's climate * Coccolithophore, a group of marine unicellular planktonic photosynthetic algae, producer of DMSP * Dimethyl sulfide, a breakdown product of DMSP along with methanethiol * Dimethyl selenide, a selenium analogue of DMS produced by bacteria and phytoplankton * Emiliania huxleyi, a coccolithophorid producing DMSP ==ReferencesExternal links== * DMS and Climate Category:Sulfonium compounds Category:Carboxylate anions Category:Planktology Category:Zwitterions ","title":"Dimethylsulfoniopropionate"},{"id":"2000002","text":"Stefano Bontade (23 April 1939 – 23 April 1981) was a powerful member of the Sicilian Mafia. He was commonly called Bontade but the actual surname is Bontate. He was the boss of the Santa Maria di Gesù Family in Palermo. He was also known as the Principe di Villagrazia (Prince of Villagrazia) − the area of Palermo he controlled − and Il Falco (the Falcon). Trent'anni fa l'assassinio di Bontade, La Repubblica, April 23, 2011 He had links with several powerful politicians in Sicily with links to former prime minister Giulio Andreotti. In 1981 he was killed by the rival faction within Cosa Nostra, the Corleonesi. His death sparked a brutal Mafia War that left several hundred mafiosi dead. ==Early career== Bontade was born in Palermo into a family of Mafiosi. His father and grandfather were both powerful Mafia bosses in the area Villagrazia, Santa Maria di Gesù and Guadagna, which were rural districts before they were absorbed into the city of Palermo in the 1960s. Stefano's father, Francesco Paolo Bontade, was one of the most powerful mafiosi on the island and a pallbearer at the funeral of Mafia boss Calogero Vizzini – one of the most influential Mafia bosses of Sicily after World War II until his death in 1954.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 337-38Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 52-54 Stefano Bontade and his brother Giovanni Bontade, who would become a lawyer, studied at a Jesuit college. In 1964, at the age of 25, Stefano Bontade became the boss of the Santa Maria di Gesù Mafia Family when his father, Don Paolino Bontade, stepped down because of ill-health (he suffered from diabetes). The Mafia went through difficult times at that moment. A bloody internal struggle (known as the First Mafia War) culminated in the Ciaculli Massacre in June 1963 that killed seven police and military officers sent to defuse a bomb in an abandoned Alfa Romeo Giulietta after an anonymous phone call.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 103 The Ciaculli Massacre changed the Mafia war into a war against the Mafia. It prompted the first concerted anti-mafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy. Within a period of ten weeks 1,200 mafiosi were arrested, many of whom would be kept out of circulation for five or six years. The Sicilian Mafia Commission was dissolved and those mafiosi who had escaped arrest went into exile abroad or had to hide out in Italy. In 1968, 114 went to trial, though only ten minor figures would be convicted of anything. Bontade nonetheless managed to remain a highly important figure within Cosa Nostra, and he was also one of those responsible for ordering the death of Michele Cavataio by sending two of his soldiers, Gaetano Grado and Emanuele D'Agostino, to kill him in the Viale Lazio massacre. La strage di viale Lazio spiegata dal pentito chiave, LiveSicilia, April 28, 2009 After the killing of Pietro Scaglione – Chief Prosecutor of Palermo – on May 5, 1971, the police rounded up the known Mafia bosses. Bontade was arrested in 1972 and he was sentenced to three years in the second Trial of the 114 in July 1974, but the sentence was annulled in appeal. Nevertheless, Bontade was sent in banishment to Qualiano (in the province of Naples). The policy of banishing mafiosi to other areas in Italy backfired, because they were able to establish contacts outside the island as well. Bontade, for instance, linked up with Giuseppe Sciorio of the Maisto-clan of the Camorra, who would be initiated in Cosa Nostra. ==Cigarette smuggling and heroin trafficking== Bontade and other banished mafiosi managed to get into the market of international cigarette smuggling by imposing first their protection, and later their involvement, upon the smugglers in Naples (who were connected with the Camorra) and Palermo who had been running this activity since the 1950s. For instance, a thriving smuggler such as Nunzio La Mattina, was initiated into the Santa Maria di Gesù Family.Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, p. 231 It was only through cigarette smuggling and subsequently heroin trafficking that many mafiosi were able to survive the difficult period after the Ciaculli Massacre. But then they started to accumulate large amounts of money rapidly. According to pentito Antonio Calderone, Bontade used to say that fortunately Tommaso Spadaro did a little bit of cigarette smuggling and gave him part of the profits, \\"because they were starving to death.\\"Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 148-49 (Spadaro was related to Bontade, being a godfather to one of his children.Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, p. 312) Bontade was closely linked to the Spatola-Inzerillo- Gambino network. This network and other Sicilian suppliers dominated heroin trafficking since the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s when US and Italian law enforcement were able to significantly reduce the heroin supply of the Sicilian Mafia (the so-called Pizza Connection). The Bontade-Spatola-Inzerillo traffickers supplied the Gambino Family – through John Gambino – in New York with heroin that was refined in laboratories on the island from Turkish morphine base.Sterling, Octopus, p. 199-201 According to Giovanni Falcone, the investigating magistrate, the group had made about US$600 million. The proceeds were re-invested in real estate. Rosario Spatola, who in his youth peddled watered milk in the streets of Palermo, became Palermo's largest building contractor and biggest taxpayer of Sicily.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 37 The pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia, who belonged to the Santa Maria di Gesù Family and who was highly sought after by all Mafia families for his skills in chemistry, recalled having refined at least 1000 kilograms of heroin for Bontade. Marino Mannoia, who had been close to Bontade, decided to cooperate with the Italian state in October 1989, after his brother was killed by the Corleonesi (and subsequently saw his mother, his sister and his aunt killed as well). According to Marino Mannoia the Sicilian-born banker Michele Sindona laundered the proceeds of heroin trafficking for the Bontade-Spatola- Inzerillo-Gambino network. ==The Mattei affair== In May 1994 Mafia turncoat Buscetta declared that Bontade had been involved in the murder of Enrico Mattei, the president of Italy's state-owned oil and gas conglomerate ENI. Mattei was killed in 1962 at the request of the American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. Buscetta: 'Cosa nostra uccise Enrico Mattei', La Repubblica, May 23, 1994 The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies. Buscetta claimed that the killing was organized by Bontade, Salvatore Greco \\"Ciaschiteddu\\", and Giuseppe Di Cristina on the request of Angelo Bruno, a Sicilian born Mafia boss from Philadelphia. Buscetta also claimed that the journalist Mauro De Mauro was killed in September 1970 on the orders of Bontade because of his investigations into the death of Mattei. Quando Buscetta riapri' il caso, La Repubblica, June 22, 1995 Buscetta said that Bontade organized the kidnap, because De Mauro's investigations into the death of Mattei came very close to the Mafia, and Bontade's own role in the affair. Other pentiti said that De Mauro was kidnapped by Emanuele D'Agostino, a mafioso from Bontade's Santa Maria di Gesù Family. Il debutto in aula dell'ex padrino, La Repubblica, February 19, 2011 De Mauro's body has never been found. Marino Mannoia testified that he had been ordered by Bontade in 1977 or 1978 to dig up several bodies, including De Mauro's, and dissolve them in acid. De Mauro, la verità di Mannoia; Sciolsi il suo corpo nell' acido', La Repubblica, October 12, 2006 ==Sindona’s bogus kidnapping== Michele Sindona was in charge of one of the biggest banks in the United States, the Franklin National Bank, controlled the Vatican foreign investments and was a major sponsor of the Christian Democrat party (DC – Democrazia Cristiana), according to a 1982 parliamentary inquiry. The inquiry also pointed out Sindona's relationship with Giulio Andreotti – who served as the prime minister of Italy seven times – and who once defined Sindona as the 'rescuer of the lira'.Sterling, Octopus, p. 190-202 After Sindona's banks went bankrupt in 1974, Sindona fled to the US. In July 1979, Sindona ordered the murder of Giorgio Ambrosoli, a lawyer appointed to liquidate his failed Banca Privata Italiana. At the same time the Mafia killed police superintendent Boris Giuliano who was investigating the Mafia's heroin trafficking and had contacted Ambrosoli just two weeks before to compare investigations. While under indictment in the US, Sindona staged a bogus kidnapping in August 1979 to conceal a mysterious 11-week trip to Sicily before his scheduled fraud trial. Bontade's brother in law Giacomo Vitale (a freemason, like Bontade) was one of the persons who organised Sindona's travel. The real purpose of the kidnapping was to issue sparsely disguised blackmail notes to Sindona's past political allies – among them Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti – to engineer the rescue of his banks and recuperate Cosa Nostra's money. The plot failed and after his “release” Sindona surrendered to the FBI. The Sindona-affair showed the close links between the Mafia and certain important business men, freemasons and politicians. In the aftermath of the investigations it appeared that many of them were connected through the secret P2 lodge (Propaganda Due) of Licio Gelli.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 37-42 ==Political connections== Stefano Bontade had links with the Christian Democrat politician Salvo Lima (DC – Democrazia Cristiana) and Antonio Salvo and Ignazio Salvo, two wealthy mafia-cousins from Salemi who acted as the tax collectors on the island (tax collection was contracted out by the government).Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 148/310/383-84 Through them Bontade had access to Giulio Andreotti. Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, ruled in October 2004 that Andreotti had \\"friendly and even direct ties\\" with top men in the so-called moderate wing of Cosa Nostra, Stefano Bontade and Gaetano Badalamenti, favoured by the connection between them and Salvo Lima. According to pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia, Andreotti contacted Bontade to try to prevent the Mafia from killing DC-politician Piersanti Mattarella. Mattarella became the President of the autonomous Sicilian Region in 1978 and wanted to clean up the government's public contracts racket that benefitted Cosa Nostra. Bontade and other mafiosi felt betrayed by Mattarella (his father Bernardo Mattarella was rumored to be associated with the Mafia, but all accusations against him were not proven before any court of law).Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 423-24 Andreotti's attempt failed. After the murder of Mattarella on 6 January 1980, Andreotti again contacted Bontade to try to straighten things out. However, according to Marino Mannoia, Bontade told Andreotti: \\"we are in charge in Sicily, and unless you want the whole DC canceled out, you do as we say.\\"Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 391 Stefano Bontade was also in touch with Silvio Berlusconi in the mid-1970s, when Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire (Berlusconi became prime minister in 1994, 2001–2006, and again from 2008 to 2012).Who Are You Going To Believe?, Time Magazine, January 12, 2003Berlusconi implicated in deal with godfathers, The Guardian, December 5, 2002 Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in Arcore on the outskirts of Milan, according to Antonino Giuffrè, a mafioso who was a key aide to Mafia kingpin Bernardo Provenzano but turned state witness after his arrest in April 2002. Bontade's contact at Arcore was the late Vittorio Mangano, a convicted mafioso who used to be a stable manager there. \\"When Vittorio Mangano got the job in the Arcore villa, Stefano Bontade and some of his close aides used to meet Berlusconi using visits to Mangano as an excuse,\\" Giuffrè said.Mafia supergrass fingers Berlusconi by Philip Willan, The Observer, January 12, 2003 Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffrè's testimony as \\"false\\" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party. ==Sicilian Mafia Commission== In 1970, the Sicilian Mafia Commission was revived. It consisted of ten members but would initially be ruled by a triumvirate consisting of Gaetano Badalamenti, Stefano Bontade and the Corleonesi boss Luciano Leggio, although it was Salvatore Riina who actually would represent the Corleonesi.Sterling, Octopus, p. 112 At the time Bontade was emerging as one of the Sicilian Mafia's acknowledged leaders. Young, rich, personable, intelligent and judicious, as well as the son of a renowned Mafia boss, it all made Bontade an undisputed candidate to sit on the Sicilian Mafia Commission. In 1975 the full Commission was reconstituted under the leadership of Badalamenti. The Mafia Commission was meant to settle disputes and keep the peace, but Leggio and his stand-in and successor, Salvatore Riina, were plotting to decimate the Palermo clans, including Bontade and Bontade's ally, Salvatore Inzerillo. At the close of 1978, the leadership of the Sicilian Mafia changed. Gaetano Badalamenti, was expelled from the Commission and Michele Greco replaced him. This marked the end of a period of relative peace and signified a major change in the Mafia itself. Greco was actually allied with Salvatore Riina, and he subsequently used his position to lure many more of Bontade's friends to their deaths in the subsequent Mafia War.uccisi a tavola i nemici. i corpi sciolti nell'acido - archiviostorico.corriere.it Historically, the Greco clan was at odds with Bontate. == Second Mafia War == The Second Mafia War raged from 1981 to 1983. In fact, two wars were being waged simultaneously by the Corleonesi clan. Riina had secretly formed an alliance of mafiosi in different families, cutting across clan divisions, in defiance of the rules concerning loyalty in Cosa Nostra. This secretive inter- family group would become known as the Corleonesi. The Corleonesi slaughtered the ruling families of the Palermo Mafia to take control of the organisation while waging a parallel war against Italian authorities and law enforcement to intimidate and prevent effective investigations and prosecutions. The Corleonesi initiated the war against the coalition led by Bontade and Badalamenti to try to control heroin trafficking. They began by first eliminating Bontade's allies outside Palermo, including Giuseppe Di Cristina and Giuseppe Calderone, the bosses of Riesi and Catania, in an effort to isolate the Palermitan bosses. Despite the larger economic means and the wider international network, the Bontade-Spatola-Inzerillo-Badalamenti network was unable to withstand the ruthless violence of the Corleonesi. The most important members of the Inzerillo, Spatola and Gambino clans were arrested in March 1980 for heroin trafficking, which undermined Bontade's position significantly. On 23 April 1981, whilst driving home from his 42nd birthday party, Bontade was machine gunned to death in his car, a Giulietta 2000, in Palermo. The slaying was carried out by Riina's favourite hitman Pino Greco also known as the \\"little old shoe\\" (scarpuzzedda) – a nephew of Michele Greco. Bontade's close ally, Salvatore Inzerillo, was killed three weeks later with the same Kalashnikov.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 373-75Sterling, Octopus, p. 209 Many of Bontade's friends, fellow mafiosi and relatives were cut down in the following months to prevent them from avenging the death of their boss. One of Bontade's close friends was Tommaso Buscetta, who subsequently became a pentito (collaborating witness) after he was arrested in Brazil in 1983.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 108-09 Salvatore Contorno, one of Bontade's trusted aides, followed Buscetta's example. They were the key witnesses that enabled prosecuting magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the Antimafia pool to successfully prosecute the Mafia in the Maxi Trial in the mid-1980s. ==ReferencesSources== *Dickie, John (2004).

The associated feasting follows a day of abstinence and traditionally begins once the First Star has been sighted.\\"Wigilja\\" at www.wigilja.com Christmas is also sometimes called \\"Gwiazdka\\", \\"little star\\". ==Traditions and customs== Christmas tree in a Polish home Children usually decorate the Christmas tree. Sometimes a handful of hay is placed under the tablecloth of the dining table to symbolise Jesus's birth in a manger. One old tradition states that when children playfully remove a piece of straw from under the tablecloth, its colour has meaning: Green indicates wealth or possibly a marriage, while black augurs bad luck for the year. Another tradition, is to make an extra place-setting for the \\"unexpected guest\\", to celebrate hospitality. The feast begins with Grace and breaking of the \\"Christmas wafer\\" opłatek - to symbolise the gift of daily bread and wishing each other blessings for the coming year. In the country, it was customary to share a special (pink) wafer with livestock and dogs and cats as the animals of the household were to be treated with special reverence on that day, in honour of the animals in the Bethlehem stable. There was a belief that at midnight they were granted the power of human speech. ===The Wigilia Supper=== The bread used throughout Wigilia has been borrowed from Shabbat, especially the challah (Polish: chałka) A Christmas Eve dinner excludes meat, as abstinence is required and should comprise twelve distinct dishes in memory of the twelve Apostles. It begins with a soup, either Borscht with Uszka (tortellini), or wild mushroom consommé (grzybowa), followed by herring in different forms. Fish provides the main dish of the Christmas Eve feast across Poland. There are variations of carp fillet, carp in aspic, gefilte fish (Jewish-style carp), sweet with onions, carrots, almonds and raisins. Accompaniments consist of cabbage, cooked red or Sauerkraut with apple salad. The bread served at the meal is often Challah, doubtless borrowed from Poland's centuries-long Jewish fellow countrymen. Then there is an array of desserts, including dried fruit compote, followed by cake: poppy seed cakes, babka, makowiec , and other delicacies including edible Christmas ornaments. Regional variants include, żurek sour rye soup, siemieniotka (in Silesia), Kulebiak, pierogi filled with cheese and potatoes as well mushrooms and cabbage, stuffed cabbage with mushrooms and rice, gołąbki (cabbage rolls), kluski with poppyseed, and makówki (in Silesia). There is in places a belief that whatever happens on Wigilia affects the incoming year; if a quarrel should arise, it foretells a quarrelsome and troublesome year. Traditionally, an extra place is set on the table for an \\"uninvited guest\\". ====The Shepherd's Mass==== Some families as well as individual worshippers attend the traditional midnight mass/Shepherd's Mass (pasterka), where Christmas carols are also sung. A major part of the Wigilia festivities is the opening of gifts. After everyone has finished supper the children often open their gifts and hand out the gifts for the adults from under the tree. The gift-givers in Polish tradition are \\"Święty Mikołaj\\" - Saint Nicolas, \\"Aniołek\\", an angel, \\"Gwiazdka\\", a star – Saint Nicholas' feminine counterpart – or the Gwiazdor (masculine), which is either a Pagan tradition or represents the little Star of Bethlehem. Saint Nicholas traditionally used to bring gifts on December 6. This varies and in some families Saint Nicholas brings presents both on the 6th and at Christmas. ===The Christmas breakfast=== Christmas Day is a national holiday in Poland and most Poles spend the day with their family. After (Wigilia) there are two more days of celebrations. Christmas breakfast often consists of scrambled eggs, cold-cuts served with horseradish sauce, smoked or fried salmon, marinated salads, and cakes, especially, pierniki Toruńskie (a gingerbread), cake, and decorated biscuits. ==See also== * List of dining events ==ReferencesExternal links== *The 12 Dishes of Polish Christmas on Culture.pl *Wigilia article from the Polish American Center *Wigilia article from Pope John Paul II Polish Center *Wigilia article from the Polish Museum of America Category:Christmas meals and feasts Category:Polish traditions Category:Christmas in Poland Category: Dining events Category:Slavic holidays pl:Wigilia Bożego Narodzenia ","title":"Wigilia"},{"id":"2000026","text":"The phrase \\"Sick man of Asia\\" or \\"Sick man of East Asia\\" () refers to a country in Asia undergoing economic or political strife. It originally referred to Qing Dynasty China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when it was riven by internal divisions and taken advantage of by the great powers. ==Early usage== The term \\"sick man of Europe\\" was initially coined in 1853 to refer to the Ottoman Empire, which was then in a state of decline. After World War I the phrase was applied to various European countries including France, Italy, the UK, Spain and Germany. One of the earliest instances of the term “sick man” being applied to China is in the January 5, 1863 edition of the Daily News in an article about the ongoing Taiping Rebellion. That article was reprinted in the January 7, 1863 edition of the Belfast Morning News under the title “The Supposed ‘Sick Man’ in China.” In 1895, after Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War, Chinese writer Yan Fu described China as a “sick man” (病夫) in an article titled “On the Origin of Strength” in his newspaper Zhibao, helping popularize the term among Chinese intellectuals. In 1896, the British-run North China Daily News published an article stating: “There are four sick people of the world – Turkey, Persia, China, Morocco … China is the Sick Man of the East.” The phrase was not intended to be a derogatory comment on Chinese people's health, but rather a metaphor for the corruption and incompetence of the Qing government. Around then, the phrase was adopted by Chinese thinkers who aimed to reform the Qing government, among them Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei. It was Liang who, in his 1902 New People, first associated \\"sick man\\" with the physical health of the Chinese population, which was then afflicted by opium addiction, linking it to China's inability to defend itself militarily. According to Jui-sung Yang, professor at National Chengchi University, though Chinese intellectuals, such as Zeng Pu, initially agreed with the description of China as a \\"sick man\\", the term gradually became seen as the Westerners mocking, humiliating, and insulting China. ==Contemporary usage== One of the most prominent 20th-century uses of the phrase was in the 1972 Hong Kong film Fist of Fury starring Bruce Lee, which was released across Asia. According to Chinese writer Chang Ping, that film, and others, combined with Chinese education about its \\"century of humiliation\\", have linked the term \\"sick man\\" with Chinese colonial history, making it a symbol of foreign bullying. Recently, the term has been applied to countries other than China. For example, an April 2009 article entitled \\"The Sick Man of Asia\\" refers to Japan, not China. The Philippines became the sick man of Asia during the conjugal dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s until his regime's downfall in 1986.https://rappler.com/voices/imho/marcos- economy-golden-age-philippines The country managed to rise economically afterwards, where in 2013, under the presidency of Benigno Aquino III, the country was dubbed by the World Bank as Asia's Rising Tiger.https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/02/06/905371/philippines-asias- rising-tiger-world-bank In 2014, the Japan External Trade Organization survey showed \\"the Philippines as the second most profitable among ASEAN-5 countries, next to Thailand,\\" formally abolishing the \\"sick man\\" status of the Philippines. However, by August 2020, the Philippines was again considered a \\"sick man\\" economy, amidst a severe recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/world/philippines-eclipses- indonesia-as-sick-man-of-asia/news-story/e651fa8fa4dcbc79bb46b4c228ff890b ===2020 Wall Street Journal article=== On February 3, 2020, The Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece by Walter Russell Mead regarding the COVID-19 epidemic entitled, \\"China is the Real Sick Man of Asia\\". On February 19, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang issued a statement revoking the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters and ordering their expulsion. The statement said the WSJ article \\"slandered\\" China's efforts in fighting COVID-19 and \\"used such [a] racially discriminatory title, triggering indignation and condemnation among the Chinese people and the international community.\\" ==See also== * Sick man of Europe * Unequal treaty * Concessions in China * List of Chinese treaty ports * Century of humiliation ==References== Category:Qing dynasty Category:Pejoratives Category:Politics of China Category:Anti-Chinese sentiment Category:Racism Category:Discrimination ","title":"Sick man of Asia"},{"id":"2000039","text":"Howard Books (formerly Howard Publishing) is a Christian publishing company founded in 1969 by Alton Howard and previously based in West Monroe, Louisiana, but which relocated to Brentwood, Tennessee, (south of Nashville) in September 2009.Christian publisher Howard Books moves to Brentwood, The Tennessean, September 23rd, 2009 I Howard Books publishes inspirational content. ==History== Author and hymn writer, Alton Howard, was very influential in the musical traditions of the churches of Christ since the 1960s.

It represented mainly General Electors and multiracial people, and claimed to follow moderate, centrist policies. From 2001 it was led by Mick Beddoes, the sole member elected from the party to the 71-member House of Representatives in the general election. The party was dissolved in January 2013. ==History of the UPP== The party, originally called the United General Party, was formed in the late 1990s by a merger between the General Voters Party and the General Electors Association, formerly the All National Congress (ANC). This followed an earlier move in which ethnic Fijian members of the ANC had left to join the Fijian Association Party. Both groups were fragments of the old Alliance Party, the party which ruled Fiji from 1967 to 1987. In 2003, the party announced a drive to broaden its base to attract support from Fiji's major ethnic communities, indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians. On 2 August, Beddoes announced a decision to rename the party. The name \\"General\\" was associated with Fiji's minority communities, he said, and the party wanted a more inclusive name. The party's general secretary, Bruce Rounds, said on 2 November that a growing number of people from all ethnic groups had expressed interest in joining the party, and it had decided, in principle, to field candidates in all 71 constituencies in the general election expected to be held in 2006. The 2004 name change is one step the party has taken to recast itself as a multiracial party. ==Party policies== The United Peoples Party has been a vocal critic of the government's legislation to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, a proposed tribunal with the authority (subject to presidential approval) to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup d'état which deposed the elected government in 2000. Calling the proposal a recipe for disaster which would create a \\"legal framework\\" to pardon, at will, anyone convicted of coup-related offence, party leader Mick Beddoes said on 16 May 2005 that it would lead to the prevalence of the law of the jungle and would license any would-be political activist who wanted to engage in coups, to do so. He accused the government of pandering to its junior coalition partner, the Conservative Alliance, to which many of those convicted of coup-related offenses belong. On 14 June, the party announced the beginning of a Yellow Ribbon Campaign to promote a petition aimed at forcing the bill to be withdrawn, or at least significantly amended. On 17 June, Beddoes accused Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase of lying about widespread public support for the bill, claiming that the \\"small group of dissenters\\" that the Prime Minister said existed were, in fact, the minority who knew what the bill contained. He said that asking the Fijian people to support the legislation without making them aware of its contents was \\"a deliberate attempt to mislead the Fijian community.\\" ==Towards 2006== The UPP announced on 28 June 2005 that Josephine Raikuna Williams, the former Mayor of Nadi, would be a candidate for the party at the general election expected to be held in 2006. The Fijian electoral system employs the so-called alternate ballot, whereby votes cast for low-polling candidates may be transferred to higher-polling candidates according to the ranking specified by the candidate, which may be customized by the individual voter. It is usual, therefore, for parties to negotiate preference deals before elections. Mick Beddoes emphasized on 8 September 2005 that any such agreement with the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) or the National Alliance Party (NAPF) would have to be favourable to UPP candidates. They did not want to be caught, he said, in a situation in which the UPP merely collected votes to benefit other parties. He also said that some executives of the UPP were opposed to making any deals with other parties. On 18 September, however, Beddoes announced that he was negotiating with FLP about the possibility of an electoral coalition. He also intended to negotiate with the National Alliance Party and possibly the National Federation Party, he said. On 16 October, he said that negotiations between the UPP and the FLP had finalized a deal, and that the UPP executive had endorsed it the day before. \\"We share similar positions on issues of unemployment, poverty alleviation, health and other areas. It is also based on our belief in the rights of all our citizens and their need for equality under the law,\\" Beddoes said. The two parties signed a memorandum of understanding on 2 December, agreeing to exchange preferences at the 2006 election. The agreement called for a joint manifesto to be drawn up, but left open the possibility of each party contesting any or all of the 71 seats separately, or of fielding joint candidates by mutual agreement. The agreement also left open the possibility of other parties joining the coalition. Beddoes had earlier announced on 10 October that the party hoped to field a full slate of candidates, comprising 36 indigenous Fijians, 26 Indo-Fijians, and 1 Rotuman, with each of the country's eight principal minority communities represented by one candidate each. Negotiations towards forming a coalition with other parties were ongoing, he said, but no final decision had been taken. The coalition agreement with the FLP did not exclude deals with other parties, Beddoes emphasized on 15 December 2005. Talks with other parties about electoral pacts were continuing, he said. The 2006 conference, held on 18–19 March, chose Loto Feifei (North Eastern), David Blakelock (Suva City), and Margaret Rounds (West Central) as the party's three vice-presidents. The party won 1% of the vote and 2 out of 71 seats in the 2006 election. ==2006 coup and Dissolution== The party opposed the 2006 Fijian coup d'état. However, Deputy Leader Bernadette Ganilau accepted a position in the 2007 interim government, and was asked to resign from the party in response. In January 2013 the Fijian regime announced new political party registration rules which would make it difficult for parties to contest elections. In response the party announced that it was shutting down as it could not meet the required number of members. It urged its members to join one of the three remaining major political parties in an effort to shift them towards a more multiracial membership. ==References== United Peoples Party ","title":"United Peoples Party (Fiji)"},{"id":"2000056","text":"Napoleon at St. Helena may refer to: * Napoleon at Saint Helena a 1929 German film directed by Lupu Pick * an alternative name for Forty Thieves (card game) ","title":"Napoleon at St. Helena"},{"id":"2000060","text":"Michael James Brown (born 9 February 1980) is an English first-class cricketer. ==Early life== Brown was born in Burnley, Lancashire, attending Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in neighbouring Blackburn.QEGS website Accessed 2011 Like many of his family, he began playing cricket for Burnley Cricket Club, making his debut for the adult side at age 14.

He received his primary Islamic education in Ludhiana, British India and finished it in Multan, Pakistan under the guidance of Khair Muhammad Jalandhari before becoming a distinguished teacher of Hadith first in Faisalabad and Sahiwal, Punjab, Pakistan and then at Jamia Binoria in Karachi, Pakistan. Yusuf Ludhianvi wrote over 100 books which have been translated into numerous languages. Aap Kay Masail Aur Unka Hul (regarded as Hanafi Fiqh authority) and Ikhtilaf-e- Ummat and Sirat-e-Mustaqeem (Factions in the Ummah and the Straight Path) are among his memorable works. Besides being the editor of Al-Bayyinat, he was the Vice-President of Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz Khatm-e- Nubuwwat (International Committee for the Protection of the Finality of Prophethood) and one of the founding fathers of the Iqra School chain. He taught hadith at Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia in Karachi, one of the largest seminaries in Pakistan. Considering his religious knowledge and ability, Muhammad Yousuf Banuri, Amir of Jamia Binoria, appointed him to edit the 'Khatm-e-Nubuwwat' (weekly newspaper) and the 'Al-Bayyinat' (monthly magazine). Before being murdered, Yusuf Ludhianvi had been leading efforts to end the ongoing violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims. He was a well-known scholar of the Muslim majority Sunni sect of Islam and had thousands of followers all over Pakistan. Hundreds of his supporters came out in the streets of Karachi to protest his murder and the news of the murder even caused a decline in the Pakistan Stock Exchange index at the end of the day. ==ReferencesBibliographyExternal links== * Ahrar: a chapter in Indian Muslim history on The Milli Gazette (newspaper) * Selected Writings Category:1932 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Pakistani Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Punjabi people Category:People from Ludhiana Category:Pakistani educators Category:Hanafi fiqh scholars ","title":"Muhammad Yusuf Ludhianvi"},{"id":"2000100","text":"The Oblongs may refer to: *The Television series, The Oblongs *The artist, Angus Oblong *the Oblongs… is the theme song for Teenagers & Adults from the TV series the Oblongs… sung by They Might Be Giants.

His tenure was marked by an unprecedented growth in church membership and his “Global Mission initiative” in the Adventist Church. After his resignation to the President position he worked within the laity of the church through worldwide programs through ShareHim/Global Evangelism. == Biography == Folkenberg was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico on 1 January 1941 to North American missionaries serving in Latin America and Central America. Folkenberg’s education up to Grade 4 took place in Puerto Rico, before attending schools in Cuba, entering high school in California and completing high school in Milo, Oregon in 1958. The next year, Folkenberg enrolled in Atlantic Union College where he remained for one year before a one-year stint at Newbold College. In 1962, Folkenberg graduated from Andrews University and obtained his masters in New Testament theology from Andrews in 1963. Prior to his election as General Conference President in 1990, Folkenberg served as President of the Carolina Conference. His move in 1998 to establish a \\"Board of Ministerial and Theological Education\\" in every Division of the church was criticised and put on hold.Besieged President Resigns by Mark A. Kellner. Christianity Today He championed the vision of a “Global Mission initiative” in the Adventist Church. An expected long tenure as president was cut short by his decision to resign amid allegations of financial impropriety in his personal life. His decision was not an admission of guilt but rather an expression of concern that the church not be marred by his cooperation in the investigation. A Christianity Today article says \\"During his presidency, Folkenberg, known for a somewhat brusque management style, shook up the denomination, spearheading mass communications initiatives that have led to massive growth in membership\\". According to Lawrence Geraty, then president of La Sierra University, while Folkenberg \\"never asked anyone to do what he himself was not willing to do,\\" his style raised hackles. Robert Folkenberg died just before his 75th birthday on December 24, 2015, from a recurrence of colon cancer, at his home in Winter Haven, Florida, surrounded by family. === Financial improprieties === Robert Folkenberg had business dealings with James Moore, who was convicted of grand-theft felony in 1987.http://www.sdadefend.org/MINDEX-E-F/Folkenberg-870.pdf In August 21, 1998, Moore sued Folkenberg, the General Conference Corporation, and Inter- America Division, alleging that Folkenberg had stolen 8,000,000 dollars from him. The suit was settled out of court on February 26, 1999. Meetings were held by ADCOM on January 27, and 28 of that year, questioning Folkenberg on his dealings. They asked him to resign, but he refused.http://www.sdadefend.com/MINDEX-E-F/Folkenberg-Fall.pdf Finally on February 7, 1999, he resigned his position as president of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. ==See also== * General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists * Seventh-day Adventist Church * Seventh-day Adventist theology * Seventh-day Adventist eschatology * History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church == External links == *“Seventh-Day Adventist Leader Resigns Over Financial Queries,” Los Angeles Times, February 9, 1999 *\\"Fatal Accounts\\" SDA General Conference chief auditor David Dennis' book *Face to Face With Robert S.

The park occupies an area of and was established in 1975. It is classified as a Natural Environment Park and therefore all land is protected. Giants Tomb Island, located in southern Georgian Bay approximately from the mainland and the majority of the island is part of the park. On the island, no overnight camping is allowed, and no facilities are provided. Recreational activities at Awenda include camping, swimming, canoeing and hiking. Geological features include the Nipissing Bluff and a kettle lake formed during the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the most recent ice age. The shoreline consists of a series of sand, cobble, and boulder beaches. Much of this area was logged around the beginning of the 20th century, so most of the mature deciduous forests here are actually second growth. Although dominated by mature deciduous forest, the park has an incredible diversity of habitats for its size, including: bogs, fens, coastal meadow marshes, dunes and pine oak savanna. It supports a rich variety of plant and animal life -including 32 species of amphibians and reptiles. ==Park information== The park contains 6 public campgrounds with approximately 330 sites available and 3 group camping sites allowing for large groups to camp together. Several sites are equipped with electricity and available for RVs. Camp sites are available in quiet zones (radio free) and one area of the campground (Snake campground) is pet-free and radio free. Check in times for campsites is 2pm on the date of arrival and campers must be checked out by 2pm on the date of departure. However, with the use of the vehicle permit that is given at time of arrival a camper can use park facilities until 10pm on the day of departure. The park includes 5 beaches, one of which is pet-friendly (pets are required to be on a leash). Kettle Lake The park also has over of hiking trails, with a variety of shorter and longer trails. These include the: * Robitaille Homestead Trail ( return), a trail which takes walkers to an ancient dune system. The age of these sand dunes has been estimated at 11,500 years, from the time of the last glacial retreat. The dunes are a very fragile environment and it is prohibited to climb the hillside, stand on the edge of the bluff or climb down the bluff. The purpose is to allow plants to reestablish themselves and to preserve this area for future park visitors. * Wendat Trail (Loop ), a trail which wraps around Kettle Lake following closely on sections of the shore. An area for wildlife viewing, specifically for birds such as the blue heron, loons, and small birds. A built boardwalk brings visitors over the wetlands. Canoes can be rented at the park to be used on Kettle's Lake. No bike or kayak rentals available. Natural Heritage programs are scheduled throughout the summer and include Owl Prowls, nature hikes, and children's programs. Park wardens are on staff at all times and are constantly monitoring campgrounds in case of emergency. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Friends of Awenda Category:Provincial parks in Ontario Category:Parks in Simcoe County Category:Year of establishment missing Category:Campsites in Canada Category:Protected areas of Simcoe County Category:1975 establishments in Ontario Category:Protected areas established in 1975 ","title":"Awenda Provincial Park"},{"id":"2000110","text":"Ratu Jovesa Dauruatana Sovasova (1942 - 8 April 2005) was a Fijian chief, who held the title of Tui Vitogo, or Paramount Chief of Vitogo village, from 30 June 1970 till his death.

The vehicle was previously known as the Armoured Combat Vehicle — Stretched The ACV-19 is a further development of the ACV-15, which is developed from the M113 series of armoured personnel carriers built by United Defense of the United States. The vehicle is in service with Turkey and has obtained export orders from Jordan, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates. ==Development== The two prototypes were completed in 1998 and 2000. ==Description== The ACV-S retains the basic shape of the M113, although it is actually derived from the ACV-300, an infantry fighting vehicle derived itself from the M113. The ACV-S retains a high number of common parts with the M113. The primary difference is the addition of an extra roadwheel, lengthening the body, and allowing for greater weight. This permits an increase in armour protection as well as the ability to install a larger turret. However, the vehicle remains air-portable on many western aircraft, including the C-130 Hercules, C-5 Galaxy, C-141 Starlifter, and C-17 Globemaster III. The hull is both longer and wider than previous versions. Compared with the original M113, the ACV-S has 25% more internal space and can support 75% more weight. On the infantry fighting vehicle version (the primary version of the program), the passenger compartment is fitted with bench seating along the center of the space, with access via a powered rear ramp (a door is fitted within the ramp). The vehicle is air conditioned and fitted with an over-pressure system for NBC protection. The driver is seated in the front left of the hull, with the engine mounted to their right. Armor protection is sufficient to defeat rounds up to 14.5 mm. Additional armor can be added however to increase protection against rounds up to 30 mm, as well as to defeat light rockets such as the RPG-7. 18 mm of armor as well as spall liners are provided for the floor of the vehicle to defend against mines. ==References== Category:Tracked infantry fighting vehicles Category:Armoured fighting vehicles of Turkey ACV-19 ","title":"FNSS ACV-19"},{"id":"2000114","text":"Infanta Margarita of Spain, Duchess of Soria, 2nd Duchess of Hernani, Grandee of Spain (Margarita María de la Victoria Esperanza Jacoba Felicidad Perpetua de Todos los Santos de Borbón y Borbón; born 6 March 1939), is the younger sister of King Juan Carlos and aunt of the reigning King Felipe VI of Spain. ==Early life== Infanta Margarita was born at American Hospital in Rome as the younger daughter of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, and Princess Mercedes of the Two Sicilies.

Count Alexander Romanovich Vorontsov () (4 February 17412 December 1805) was the Chancellor of the Russian Empire during the early years of Alexander I's reign. He began his career at the age of fifteen in the Izmailovsky regiment of the Guards. He was the only son of Russian General-in-chief Roman Illarionovich Vorontsov (1707—1783) and Marfa Ivanovna Surmina (1718—1745). In 1759, Alexander's uncle, the grand chancellor Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov, sent him to Strasbourg, Paris and Madrid to train him in diplomacy. Under Peter III, who was in love with his sister Elizabeth, he represented Russia for a short time at the court of St James's. Catherine II created him a senator and president of the Board of Trade; but she never liked him, and ultimately (1791) compelled him to retire from public life. In 1802, Alexander I summoned him back to office and appointed him imperial chancellor. This was the period of the triumph of the Vorontsovs, who had always insisted on the necessity of a close union with Austria and Great Britain,Карабанов П. Ф.

Vorontsov was also an implacable opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte, whose \\"topsy-turvyness\\" he was never weary of denouncing. The rupture with Napoleon in 1803 is mainly attributable to him. He also took a leading part in the internal administration and was in favour of a thorough reform of the Governing Senate and the ministries. He retired in 1804. A lifelong bachelor, he possessed an extraordinary memory and a firm and wide grasp of history. His Memoirs of My Own Times is printed in vol. VII of the Vorontsov Archives. == Family members == *Vorontsov - his family *Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov - his uncle *Ekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova - his sister *Elizaveta Vorontsova - his sister *Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov - his brother *Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov - his nephew. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Online Museum of the Vorontsov Family Category:Senators of the Russian Empire Category:Foreign ministers of the Russian Empire Category:Chancellors of the Russian Empire Category:Members of the State Council of the Russian Empire Category:Russian nobility Category:1741 births Category:1805 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the Russian Empire Category:18th-century Russian people Alexander Category:Ambassadors of the Russian Empire to the United Kingdom ","title":"Alexander Vorontsov"},{"id":"2000128","text":"Internet identity (IID), also online identity or internet persona, is a social identity that an Internet user establishes in online communities and websites. It can also be considered as an actively constructed presentation of oneself. Although some people choose to use their real names online, some Internet users prefer to be anonymous, identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information. An online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online. Some can even be deceptive about their identity. In some online contexts, including Internet forums, online chats, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), users can represent themselves visually by choosing an avatar, an icon-sized graphic image. Avatars are one way users express their online identity. Through interaction with other users, an established online identity acquires a reputation, which enables other users to decide whether the identity is worthy of trust. Online identities are associated with users through authentication, which typically requires registration and logging in. Some websites also use the user's IP address or tracking cookies to identify users. The concept of the self, and how this is influenced by emerging technologies, are a subject of research in fields such as education, psychology and sociology. The online disinhibition effect is a notable example, referring to a concept of unwise and uninhibited behavior on the Internet, arising as a result of anonymity and audience gratification. ==Online social identityIdentity expression and identity exposure=== The social web, i.e. the usage of the web to support the social process, represents a space in which people have the possibility to express and expose their identity in a social context. For example, people define their identity explicitly by creating user profiles in social network services such as Facebook or LinkedIn and online dating services. By expressing opinions on blogs and other social media, they define more tacit identities. The disclosure of a person's identity may present certain issues related to privacy. Many people adopt strategies that help them control the disclosure of their personal information online. Some strategies require users to invest considerable effort. The emergence of the concept of online identity has raised many questions among academics. Social networking services and online avatars have complicated the concept of identity. Academia has responded to these emerging trends by establishing domains of scholarly research such as technoself studies, which focuses on all aspects of human identity in technological societies. Online activities may affect our offline personal identity, as well. Avi Marciano has coined the term \\"VirtuReal\\" to resolve the contested relationship between online and offline environments in relation to identity formation. Studying online usage patterns of transgender people, he suggested that the internet can be used as preliminary, complementary, and/or alternative sphere. He concludes that although \\"the offline world sets boundaries that potentially limit the latitude within the online world, these boundaries are wide enough to allow mediated agency that empowers transgender users. Consequently, the term VirtuReal \\"reflects both the fact that it provides an empowering virtual experience that compensates for offline social inferiority, and the fact that it is nevertheless subject to offline restrictions\\". ===The concept of the mask=== Dorian Wiszniewski and Richard Coyne in their contribution to the book Building Virtual Communities explore online identity, with emphasis on the concept of \\"masking\\" identity. They point out that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere they portray a mask of their identity. This is no different online and in fact becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor must make concerning his or her online profile. He or she must answer specific questions about age, gender, address, username and so forth. Furthermore, with the accrual of one's online activity, his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing, vocabulary and topics. The kind of mask one chooses reveals at least something of the subject behind the mask. One might call this the \\"metaphor\\" of the mask. The online mask does not reveal the actual identity of a person. It, however, does reveal an example of what lies behind the mask. For instance, if a person chooses to act like a rock star online, this metaphor reveals an interest in rock music. Even if a person chooses to hide behind a totally false identity, this says something about the fear and lack of self-esteem behind the false mask. Because of many emotional and psychological dynamics, people can be reluctant to interact online. By evoking a mask of identity a person can create a safety net. One of the great fears of online identity is having one's identity stolen or abused. This fear keeps people from sharing who they are. Some are so fearful of identity theft or abuse that they will not even reveal information already known about them in public listings. By making the mask available, people can interact with some degree of confidence without fear. Wiszniewski and Coyne state \\"Education can be seen as the change process by which identity is realized, how one finds one's place. Education implicates the transformation of identity. Education, among other things, is a process of building up a sense of identity, generalized as a process of edification.\\" Students interacting in an online community must reveal something about themselves and have others respond to this contribution. In this manner, the mask is constantly being formulated in dialogue with others and thereby students will gain a richer and deeper sense of who they are. There will be a process of edification that will help students come to understand their strengths and weaknesses. ====Blended identity==== This mask perspective is likened to the concept of 'blended identity', whereby the offline-self informs the creation of a new online-self, which in turn informs the offline-self through further interaction with those the individual first met online. It means people's self-identity varies in different social or cultural contexts. ==In different contextsBlogging=== As blogs allow an individual to express his or her views in individual essays or as part of a wider discussion, it creates a public forum for expressing ideas. Bloggers often choose to use pseudonyms, whether in platforms such as WordPress or in interest-centered sites like Blogster, to protect personal information and allow them more editorial freedom to express ideas that might be unpopular with their family, employers, etc. Use of a pseudonym (and a judicious approach to revealing personal information) can allow a person to protect their \\"real\\" identities, but still build a reputation online using the assumed name. === Human resources === Digital identity management is becoming something that individuals need to consider when applying for jobs of while working for a company. Social media has been a tool for human resources for years. A KPMG report on social media in human resources say that 76 percent of American companies used LinkedIn for recruiting. The ease of search means that reputation management will become more vital especially in professional services such as lawyers, doctors and accountants. ===Social networks=== Online social networks like Facebook and MySpace allow people to maintain an online identity with some overlap between online and real world context. These identities are often created to reflect a specific aspect or ideal version of themselves. Representations include pictures, communications with other 'friends' and membership in network groups. Privacy control settings on social networks are also part of social networking identity. Some users may use their online identity as an extension of their physical selves, and center their profiles around realistic details. These users value continuity in their identity, and would prefer being honest with the portrayal of themselves. However, there is also a group of social network users that would argue against using a real identity online. These users have experimented with online identity, and ultimately what they have found is that it is possible to create an alternate identity through the usage of such social networks. For example, a popular blogger on medium.com writes under the name of Kel Campbell – a name that was chosen by her, not given to her. She states that when she was verbally attacked online by another user, she was able to protect herself from the sting of the insult by taking it as Kel, rather than her true self. Kel became a shield of sorts, and acted as a mask that freed the real user beneath it. Such are the benefits of forming an alternate identity in online spaces. The \\"I\\" becomes subject to the \\"Me\\", and individuals are given the power to shape themselves into whoever (or whatever) they desire to become. Stories of people learning about their \\"hidden extroversion\\" or \\"unknown creativity\\" or becoming \\"someone else\\" are still at large. Research from scientists such as Danah Boyd and Knut Lundby has even found that in some cultures, the ability to form an identity online is considered a sacred privilege. This is because having an online identity allows the user to accomplish things that otherwise are impossible to do in real life. These cultures believe that the self has become a subjective concept on the online spaces; by logging onto their profiles, users are essentially freed from the prison of a physical body and can \\"create a narrative of the self in virtual space that may be entirely new\\". The possibilities are endless – which is a feasible explanation for the explosive popularity of social networking sites in the past decade. Users are captivated by the opportunity to express themselves in an endless number of ways. Perhaps social networks will always remain popular, as long as the incentive to join is always present. ===Online business=== In the development of social networks, there has appeared a new economic phenomenon: doing business via social networks. For example, there are many users of WeChat called wei- businessmen (Wechat businessman, a new form of e-commerce in Wechat) who sell products on WeChat. Doing business via social networks is not that easy. The identities of users in social networks are not the same as that in the real world. For the sake of security, people do not tend to trust someone in social networks, in particular when it is related with money. So for wei-businessmen, reputations are very important for wei-business. Once customers decide to shop via Wechat, they prefer to choose those wei-businessmen with high reputations. They need to invest enormous efforts to gain reputations among the users of WeChat, which in turn increases the chance other users will purchase from them. ===Online learning==Communication==== Online identity in classrooms forces people to reevaluate their concepts of classroom environments. With the invention of online classes, classrooms have changed and no longer have the traditional face-to-face communications. These communications have been replaced by computer screen. Students are no longer defined by visual characteristics unless they make them known. There are pros and cons to each side. In a traditional classroom, students are able to visually connect with a teacher who was standing in the same room. During the class, if questions arise, clarification can be provided immediately. Students can create face-to-face connections with other students, and these connections can easily be extended beyond the classroom. For timid or socially awkward students, this ability to form and extend relationships through personal contact may hold little appeal. For these students, the appeal may reside in online courses, where computer communications allow them a greater degree of separation and anonymity. With the prevalence of remote Internet communications, students do not form preconceptions of their classmates based on the classmate's appearance or speech characteristics. Rather, impressions are formed based only on the information presented by the classmate. Some students are more comfortable with this paradigm as it avoids the discomfort of public speaking. Students who do not feel comfortable stating their ideas in class can take time to sit down and think through exactly what they wish to say. Communication via written media may lead students to take more time to think through their ideas since their words are in a more permanent setting (online) than most conversations carried on during class (Smith). ====Perception of professor==== Online learning situations also cause a shift in perception of the professor. Whereas anonymity may help some students achieve a greater level of comfort, professors must maintain an active identity with which students may interact. The students should feel that their professor is ready to help whenever they may need it. Although students and professors may not be able to meet in person, emails and correspondence between them should occur in a timely manner. Without this students tend to drop online classes since it seems that they are wandering through a course without anyone to guide them. ===Virtual world=== In Virtual world, the users create a personal avatar and communicate with others through the virtual identity. The virtual personal figure and voice may draw from the real figure or fantasy worlds. The virtual figure to some degree reflects the personal expectation, and users may play a totally different personality in virtual world than in reality. ===Internet forum=== An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. There are many types of Internet forums based on certain themes or groups. The properties of online identities also differ from different type of forums. For example, the users in a university BBS usually know some of the others in reality since the users can only be the students or professors in this university. However the freedom of expression is limited since some university BBSs are under control of the school administration and the identities are related to student IDs. On another hand, some question-and- answer websites like \\"ZhiHu\\" in China are open to the public and users can create accounts only with e-mail address. But they can describe their specialties or personal experiences to show reliability in certain questions, and other users can also invite them to answer questions based on their profiles. The answers and profiles can be either real-name or anonymous. ==Benefits and concernsBenefits=== A discussed positive aspect of virtual communities is that people can now present themselves without fear of persecution, whether it is personality traits, behaviors that they are curious about, or the announcement of a real world identity component that has never before been announced. This freedom results in new opportunities for society as a whole, especially the ability for people to explore the roles of gender and sexuality in a manner that can be harmless, yet interesting and helpful to those undertaking the change. Online identity has given people the opportunity to feel comfortable in wide-ranging roles, some of which may be underlying aspects of the user's life that the user is unable to portray in the real world. Online identity has a beneficial effect for minority groups, including ethnic minority populations, people with disabilities, etc. Online identities may help remove prejudices created by stereotypes found in real life, and thus provide a greater sense of inclusion. A prime example of these opportunities is the establishment of many communities welcoming gay and lesbian teens who are dealing with their sexuality. These communities allow teens to share their experiences with one another and older gay and lesbian people, and may they provide a community that is both non-threatening and non-judgmental. In a review of such a community, Silberman quotes an information technology worker, Tom Reilly, as stating: \\"The wonderful thing about online services is that they are an intrinsically decentralized resource. Kids can challenge what adults have to say and make the news\\". If teen organizers are successful anywhere, news of it is readily available. The Internet is arguably the most powerful tool that young people with alternative sexualities have ever had. The online world provides users with a choice to determine which sex, sexuality preference and sexual characteristics they would like to embody. In each online encounter, a user essentially has the opportunity to interchange which identity they would like to portray. As McRae argues in Surkan (2000), \\"The lack of physical presence and the infinite malleability of bodies complicates sexual interaction in a singular way: because the choice of gender is an \\"option\\" rather than a strictly defined biological characteristic, the entire concept of gender as a primary marker of identity becomes partially subverted.\\" Online identity can offer potential social benefits to those with physical and sensory disabilities. The flexibility of online media provides control over their disclosure of impairment, an opportunity not typically available in real world social interactions. Researchers highlight its value in improving inclusion. However, it is notable that the affordance of \\"normalization\\" offers the possibility of experiencing non-stigmatized identities while also offering the capacity to create harmful and dangerous outcomes, which may jeopardize participants' safety. ===Concerns=== Primarily, concerns regarding virtual identity revolve around the areas of misrepresentation and the contrasting effects of on and offline existence. Sexuality and sexual behavior online provide some of the most controversial debate with many concerned about the predatory nature of some users. This is particularly in reference to concerns about child pornography and the ability of pedophiles to obscure their identity. Finally, the concerns regarding the connection between on and offline lives are challenging the notions of what constitutes real experience. In reference to gender, sexuality and sexual behavior, the ability to play with these ideas has resulted in a questioning of how virtual experience may affect one's offline emotions. As McRae states, at its best, virtual sex not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body, and self that has become a comfortable truism in Western metaphysics. When projected into virtuality, mind, body and self all become consciously-manufactured constructs through which individuals interact with each other. ====Reliability==== The identities that people define in the social web are not necessarily facets of their offline self. Studies have shown that people lie in online dating services. In the case of social network services such as Facebook, companies are even proposing to sell 'friends' as a way to increase a user's visibility, calling into question even more the reliability of a person's 'social identity'. Van Gelder reported a famous incident occurring on a computer conferencing system during the early 80s where a male psychiatrist posed as Julie, a female psychologist with multiple disabilities including deafness, blindness, and serious facial disfigurement. Julie endeared herself to the computer conferencing community, finding psychological and emotional support from many members. The psychiatrist's choice to present differently was sustained by drawing upon the unbearable stigma attached to Julie's multiple disabilities as justification for not meeting face-to-face. Lack of visual cues allowed the identity transformation to continue, with the psychiatrist also assuming the identity of Julie's husband, who adamantly refused to allow anyone to visit Julie when she claimed to be seriously ill. This example highlights the ease with which identity may be constructed, transformed, and sustained by the textual nature of online interaction and the visual anonymity it affords. ====Catfishing online==== Catfishing is a way for a user to create a fake online profile, sometimes with fake photos and information, in order to enter into a relationship, intimate or platonic, with another user. Catfishing became popular in mainstream culture through the MTV reality show Catfish. ==Identity management infrastructures== A problem facing anyone who hopes to build a positive online reputation is that reputations are site-specific; for example, one's reputation on eBay cannot be transferred to Slashdot. Multiple proposals have been made to build an identity management infrastructure into the Web protocols. All of them require an effective public key infrastructure so that the identity of two separate manifestations of an online identity (say, one on Wikipedia and another on Twitter) are probably one and the same. OpenID, an open, decentralized standard for authenticating users is used for access control, allowing users to log on to different services with the same digital identity. These services must allow and implement OpenID. === Context collapse === Context collapse describes the phenomena where the occurrence of multiple social groups in one space causes confusion in how to manage one's online identity. This suggests that in managing identities online, individuals are challenged to differentiate their online expression due to the unmanageable size of audience variations. This phenomenon is particularly relevant to social media platforms. Users are often connected with a wide range of social groups such as family, colleagues and friends. When posting on social media, the presence of these different social groups makes it difficult to decide which aspect of one's personality to present. The term was first coined in 2003 by Microsoft researcher Danah boyd in relation to social networking platforms such as MySpace and Friendster. Since 2003, the issue of context collapse has become increasingly significant. Users have been forced to implement strategies to combat context collapse. These strategies include using stricter privacy settings and engaging in more \\"ephemeral mediums\\" such as Instagram stories and Snapchat in which posts are only temporarily accessible and are less likely to have permanent consequences or an effect on one's reputation. ===Reputation management=== Given the malleability of online identities, some economists have expressed surprise that flourishing trading sites (such as eBay) have developed on the Internet. When two pseudonymous identities propose to enter into an online transaction, they are faced with the prisoner's dilemma: the deal can succeed only if the parties are willing to trust each other, but they have no rational basis for doing so. But successful Internet trading sites have developed reputation management systems, such as eBay's feedback system, which record transactions and provide the technical means by which users can rate each other's trustworthiness. However, users with malicious intent can still cause serious problems on such websites. An online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their digital footprint. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided and information that created online. Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, he can easily change his pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties. This is why a merchant on the web having a brick and mortar shop is usually more trusted. ===Relation to real-world social constraints=== Ultimately, online identity cannot be completely free from the social constraints that are imposed in the real world. As Westfall (2000, p. 160) discusses, \\"the idea of truly departing from social hierarchy and restriction does not occur on the Internet (as perhaps suggested by earlier research into the possibilities presented by the Internet) with identity construction still shaped by others. Westfall raises the important, yet rarely discussed, issue of the effects of literacy and communication skills of the online user.\\" Indeed, these skills or the lack thereof have the capacity to shape one's online perception as they shape one's perception through a physical body in the \\"real world.\\" ==Disembodiment and implications== This issue of gender and sexual reassignment raises the notion of disembodiment and its associated implications. \\"Disembodiment\\" is the idea that once the user is online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it. This ultimately relates to a sense of detachment from the identity defined by the physical body. In cyberspace, many aspects of sexual identity become blurred and are only defined by the user. Questions of truth will therefore be raised, particularly in reference to online dating and virtual sex. As McRae states, \\"Virtual sex allows for a certain freedom of expression, of physical presentation and of experimentation beyond one's own real-life limits\\". At its best, it not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body and self in a manner only possible through the construction of an online identity. ==Legal and security issuesOnline identity and user's rights=== The future of online anonymity depends on how an identity management infrastructure is developed. Law enforcement officials often express their opposition to online anonymity and pseudonymity, which they view as an open invitation to criminals who wish to disguise their identities. Therefore, they call for an identity management infrastructure that would irrevocably tie online identity to a person's legal identity]; in most such proposals, the system would be developed in tandem with a secure national identity document. Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, has stated that the Google+ social network is intended to be exactly such an identity system. The controversy resulting from Google+'s policy of requiring users to sign in using legal names has been dubbed the \\"nymwars\\". Online civil rights advocates, in contrast, argue that there is no need for a privacy-invasive system because technological solutions, such as reputation management systems, are already sufficient and are expected to grow in their sophistication and utility. ===Online predators=== An online predator is an Internet user who exploits other users' vulnerability, often for sexual or financial purposes. It is relatively easy to create an online identity which is attractive to people that would not normally become involved with the predator, but fortunately there are a few means by which you can make sure that a person whom you haven't met is actually who they say they are. Many people will trust things such as the style in which someone writes, or the photographs someone has on their web page as a way to identify that person, but these can easily be forged. Long- term Internet relationships may sometimes be difficult to sufficiently understand knowing what someone's identity is actually like. The most vulnerable age group to online predators is often considered to be young teenagers or older children. \\"Over time - perhaps weeks or even months - the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond.\\" The victims often do not suspect anything until it is too late, as the other party usually misleads them to believe that they are of similar age. The show Dateline on NBC has, overall, conducted three investigations on online predators. They had adults, posing online as teenage juveniles, engage in sexually explicit conversations with other adults (the predators) and arrange to meet them in person. But instead of meeting a teenager, the unsuspecting adult was confronted by Chris Hansen, an NBC News correspondent, arrested, and shown on nationwide television. Dateline held investigations in five different locations apprehending a total of 129 men in all. Federal laws have been passed in the U.S. to assist the government when trying to catch online predators. Some of these include wiretapping, so online offenders can be caught in advance, before a child becomes a victim. In California, where one Dateline investigation took place, it is a misdemeanor for someone to have sexually- tinged conversations with a child online. The men who came to the house were charged with a felony because their intent was obvious. ==The market== An online identity that has acquired an excellent reputation is valuable for two reasons: first, one or more persons invested a great deal of time and effort to build the identity's reputation; and second, other users look to the identity's reputation as they try to decide whether it is sufficiently trustworthy. It is therefore unsurprising that online identities have been put up for sale at online auction sites. However, conflicts arise over the ownership of online identities. Recently, a user of a massively multiplayer online game called EverQuest, which is owned by Sony Online Entertainment, Inc., attempted to sell his EverQuest identity on eBay.

Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth or Commonwealth of Three Nations (1658) Historian Andrew Wilson has called this \\"one of the great 'What-ifs?' of Ukrainian and East European history\\", noting that \\"If it had been successfully implemented, the Commonwealth would finally have become a loose confederation of Poles, Lithuanians and Ruthenians. The missing Ukrainian buffer state would have come into being as the Commonwealth's eastern pillar. Russian expansion might have been checked and Poland spared the agonies of the Partitions or, perhaps just as likely, it might have struggled on longer as the 'Sick man of Europe'\\" (p. 65). In spite of considerable Roman Catholic Clergy opposition, the Treaty of Hadiach was approved by Polish king and parliament (Sejm) on 22 May 1659, but with an amended text.Rober Paul Magocsi \\"A History of Ukraine\\" pp.221-225 The idea of a Ruthenian Duchy within the Commonwealth was completely abandoned.Т.Г. Таирова-Яковлева Иван Выговский // Единорогъ. Материалы по военной истории Восточной Европы эпохи Средних веков и Раннего Нового времени, вып.1, М., 2009: Под влиянием польской общественности и сильного диктата Ватикана сейм в мае 1659 г. принял Гадячский договор в более чем урезанном виде. Идея Княжества Руського вообще была уничтожена, равно как и положение о сохранении союза с Москвой. Отменялась и ликвидация унии, равно как и целый ряд других позитивных статей. It was a Commonwealth attempt to regain influence over the Ukrainian territories, lost after the series of Cossack uprisings (like the Khmelnytsky Uprising) and growing influence of Muscovy over the Cossacks (like the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav). Hetman Vyhovsky supported the negotiations with the Commonwealth, especially after he suppressed a revolt led by the colonel of Poltava, Martyn Pushkar, and severed relations with Tsardom of Russia for its violations of the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654.http://www.mfa.gov.ua/rsa/en/20226.htm The Treaty of Hadiach was, however, viewed by many Cossacks as 'too little, too late', and they especially opposed the agreement to return land property to the szlachta. After the 1648 revolt, the Commonwealth was very unpopular with ordinary Cossacks. Rank-and-file Cossacks saw Orthodox Moscow as their natural ally and did not care for alliance with the Commonwealth. Furthermore, Hadiach was too much a deal that merely benefited the elite of the Cossacks--the \\"starshyna\\"-- who wanted to be recognized as equal to the Polish nobility. Thus, while some Cossacks, among them the hetman Ivan Vyhovsky supported the Commonwealth, many did not, and Cossack unrest continued in Ukraine.Dvornik, Francis (1962) The Slavs in European History and Civilization. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press The Commonwealth position was further weakened by a string of losses in the Russo-Polish War (1654–67). The Tsar felt threatened by the Treaty of Hadiach, which weakened his hold on Cossacks. The Russians saw the treaty as an act of war, and even before it was ratified sent an army into Ukraine. Although Polish forces under hetman Stefan Czarniecki dealt defeat to Russian forces at the battle of Polonka, and recaptured Wilno in 1660, lack of other Commonwealth military successes, especially in Ukraine, further undermined Cossack support of the Commonwealth. Vyhovsky's early success at the battle of Konotop in June 1659 was not decisive enough, and was followed by a series of defeats. The Russian garrisons in Ukraine continued to hold out; a Zaporozhian attack on the Crimea forced Vyhovsky's Tatar allies to return home, and unrest broke out in the Poltava region. Finally, several pro-Russian colonels rebelled and accused Vyhovsky of \\"selling Ukraine out to the Poles.\\" Unable to continue the war, Vyhovsky resigned in October 1659 and retired to Poland. The situation was further complicated by the Ottoman Empire, which tried to gain control of the disputed region and played all factions against each other. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth was weakened by the rokosz of Jerzy Lubomirski. The treaty was mostly repeated in the 1660 Treaty of Cudnów. In the end, Russia was victorious, as seen in the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo and the 1686 Eternal Peace. Ukrainian Cossacks fell under the Russian sphere of influence, with much fewer privileges under the Hetmanate than would have been granted under the treaty of Hadiach. By the end of the 18th century, Cossack political influence has been almost completely destroyed by the Russian Empire. ==Second Treaty of Hadiach== In the aftermath of the November Uprising in 1831, there was an attempt to recreate the Treaty of Hadiach, to form a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth to throw off the partitions of Poland. It was then that the coat of arms of the proposed Commonwealth was created. The planned convention in Hadiach was declared illegal by the Russians, who stationed close to 2,000 soldiers there to ensure that no meetings or demonstrations take place and blocked passage through nearby bridges. Despite these precautions, a mass and a celebration involving 15-20,000 people and over 200 priests (both Catholic and Orthodox) took place near Hadiach. ==See also== *The Ruin (Ukrainian history)#List of Treaties ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== *Andrew Wilson, The Ukrainians: Unexpected Nation, New Haven: Yale University Press. 2000, review online *Paul Robert Magocsi, A History of Ukraine, University of Washington Press, 1996, * excerpts online ==External links== *Treaty of Hadiache *The Question of Russo- Ukrainian Unity and Ukrainian Distinctiveness in Early Modern Ukrainian Thought and Culture *Jak Powstała Rzeczpospolita Trzech Narodów, Zbigniew Święch, Alma Mater (in Polish) Category:1658 in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Poland–Ukraine military relations Category:1658 treaties Hadiach Category:Treaties of Cossack Hetmanate Category:17th century in the Zaporozhian Host ","title":"Treaty of Hadiach"},{"id":"2000141","text":"Linux is a family of computer operating systems based on the Linux kernel.

It uses a stolen base attempt to try to place the defending infielders out of position for an attempted base hit. The hit and run was introduced to baseball by Ned Hanlon, who was often referred to as \\"The Father of Modern Baseball\\", at the beginning of the 1894 season of the National League, as part of what came to be called \\"inside baseball\\". Hanlon was manager of the Baltimore Orioles at the time. His team developed the hit and run along with other tactics during spring training at Macon, Georgia. After its implementation in the season's series opener against the New York Giants, the opposing manager objected to its use; however, it was deemed acceptable. Edgar G. Brands (April 1937). \\"Ned Hanlon, Leader of Famous Orioles and Noted Strategist of Game, Dies at 79: Devised Hit and Run and Other 'Inside' Plays; He Discovered and Developed Many Players and Pilots; Won Five Flags at Baltimore and Brooklyn\\". The Sporting News. p. 12. ==Description== The hit and run relies on the positioning of the defensive players in the infield. The first and third basemen normally stand near the foul lines, generally near the inside of their bases, set slightly back to allow more time to react to sharply hit balls. However, if the runner is on first, the first baseman stands closer to the base to prevent steals by means of pick-off attempts by the pitcher; consequently, such positioning produces a bigger gap between second and first basemen. The second baseman and shortstop stand on opposite sides of second base, covering the areas between first and second, and second and third, respectively. Second base itself is not directly covered, as the pitcher can field batted balls in this direction. In normal play, if the ball is hit into the infield, one of the infielders will run toward the ball while another runs toward the base that is no longer covered. For instance, if the ball is hit toward the second baseman, he will run toward the ball while the shortstop runs to cover second base. This allows the fielding player to throw the ball to the player covering the base to attempt a put out. However, during a stolen base attempt, the normal gameplay and positioning is altered. In the typical case, a baserunner on first base will start running toward second, causing the middle infielders to move toward that base in order to tag the runner when the ball is thrown to them from the pitcher or catcher. This reaction places the infielders out of position for a hit ball, with gaps opening at midway points between first and second and second and third. The hit and run takes advantage of this difference by having the baserunner attempt to steal as soon as the pitch is thrown; the batter then attempts to hit the ball into one of the resulting gaps in the infield defense. The name \\"hit and run\\" is therefore a potential misnomer in that the chronological order of the offensive play is \\"run and hit,\\" with the runner beginning the steal attempt before the batter makes contact, although in a logical sense it is accurate in that the batter's swing occurs while the runner's steal attempt is ongoing, such that any contact (\\"hit\\") will occur simultaneously with (\\"and\\") the steal attempt (\\"run\\"). Ideally, the ball will be hit into a gap and travel into the outfield, allowing the runners plenty of time to reach the bases. Even if the ball is hit toward a fielder's initial position before the fielder has had time to move away from it, however, the fielder may have turned to run toward the base in order to cover the baserunner. In normal play the fielders would face the batter, allowing them to react in any direction, but after they have turned toward the base this becomes much more difficult. Their momentum in this direction adds to this problem. The hit and run also has defensive qualities. In normal play the baserunner would start toward second base when the ball was hit. If the defensive players react fast enough, they may be able to throw the ball to second and first before either runner has reached their base, resulting in a double play. In the case of the hit and run, the baserunner has a head start, increasing the baserunner's probability of reaching second base before the ball. This may force the fielders to attempt the out only at first, thereby advancing the runner. It may also allow the runner to advance more bases on a hit than he might otherwise due to that running head start. Although a line drive can easily turn into a double play, line drives are rare so the risk of being doubled off from a line drive is minimal. The risk in the hit and run is that, if the batter fails to make contact with the ball, the runner is vulnerable to being thrown out at second base, which the official scorer will record as a caught stealing.A runner trying to advance on a failed hit and run is more likely to be thrown out than a runner attempting a \\"straight steal\\" of second, because the runner is not waiting for the best pitch to steal on, and does not get the best head start on the way there because he waits a bit longer at the original base to preserve the deception a while longer. The defensive team can improve its odds in this case by using a pitchout, having the pitcher throw the ball far outside the strike zone so the catcher can easily catch it and attempt to pick off the runner. The batter may choose to take a swing at a bad pitch to make it harder for the catcher to handle the incoming pitch, or so the ball goes foul (in which case the runner is allowed to return to first, so the attempt protects the runner from being caught stealing). Either way, this can cause the batter to fall behind in the count, making it harder for him to get a hit. And if he does hit a bad pitch he really can't handle, it could result in poor contact leading directly to the batter being put out, so he may end up giving his at-bat away with no advantage to the offense. The hit and run has the best chance to be successful when the batter is someone who does not frequently swing and miss, at a time when the count won't disadvantage a hitter if he takes a bad swing, with a runner fast enough to take second base even if the batter does swing and miss. Often the precise circumstance to call for a hit and run occurs with a two-balls, one-strike count on a hitter, as this situation may meet all of the above criteria, depending on who is at bat and who is on base, but it can occur at other times. An alert defense understands the probability that the offense will call the play at a specific moment, and thus it may choose to call for a pitchout at that moment to defend it. An alert offense, in turn, understands the probability of a forthcoming pitchout, and use the hit and run opportunity as a decoy, causing the pitchout to become another ball in the count in the hitter's favor, increasing his chances of reaching base by walk or hit. The hit and run is a very old baseball strategy, dating back to the 19th-century game. ==NotesReferences== Category:Baseball terminology Category:Baseball plays ","title":"Hit and run (baseball)"},{"id":"2000154","text":"Cranky may refer to: * Cranky Kong, a character from the Donkey Kong video game series * Cranky the Crane, a character from the children's television series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends * Mr. Cranky, a satirical film critic personae since 1995 * Irritability * Crankie, a form of moving panorama performance operated by a crank * Cranky, a character from Where's My Water ==See also== * Crank (disambiguation) * Kranky (disambiguation) ","title":"Cranky"},{"id":"2000156","text":"King George V College (KGV) is a sixth form college in Southport, Merseyside, England.

The college has the distinction of being placed consistently in the top 10 sixth form and further education colleges in the country for A-level results, and has won a number of Good Schools Guide awards. ==History== The college opened in September 1920 as Southport Municipal Secondary School for Boys. New buildings were constructed at the current site on Scarisbrick New Road in 1926, in preparation for a reopening by the Earl of Derby on 16 October of that year, when the institution was rechristened King George V Grammar School. In September 1979 the college assumed its current name; in 1982 its school section ceased to exist. In October 2014, Ofsted placed KGV — previously a grade 1 'outstanding' college — in the 'inadequate' or grade 4 boundary for education providers. The report cited a lack of effective leadership and severe staff cuts as reasons for its poor findings. In June of the following year, Ofsted upgraded the college's 'inadequate' grade after a second report announced significant improvement. Since 2014 several of the site's buildings have been refurbished, including the sports hall and the humanities building. During this renovation the two-room Classics building, then the longest-standing building on the campus, was demolished. ==Academic structure== alt=A two-story modern building of red brick and white- painted metal with glass windows and a curved white roof, with \\"King George V College\\" visible on one side.

He was born in Faridpur, East Bengal, to a cultured and prosperous Vaidya-Brahmin family. While in his teens he came under the influence of Sri Aurobindo, then a well known revolutionary fighting for independence against the British. When in his fourth year at Presidency College, Calcutta, he left a promising academic career and rejected a lucrative government job to join a small revolutionary group under Sri Aurobindo. In May 1908 he was among those arrested for conspiracy in the Alipore bomb case. Acquitted a year later, after having spent a year in jail, he worked as a sub-editor for the Dharma and the Karmayogin, two of Sri Aurobindo's Nationalist newspapers, in 1909 and 1910. He was taught Greek, Latin, French and Italian by Sri Aurobindo himself and was among the four disciples who were with Aurobindo in 1910 at Pondicherry. When the Sri Aurobindo Ashram was founded in 1926, he settled permanently in Pondicherry serving the Mother and Sri Aurobindo as secretary of the ashram and later as one of its trustees.

Founded in 1886 by the Rev William Fitzjames Oldham, it was recognised as an IB World School in 2005, and has since consistently ranked among the top 3 schools worldwide that offer the IB Diploma Programme. ACS(I) was also one of the first schools to offer the Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) and is one of two schools, alongside Raffles Institution, to pioneer both the GEP, now SBGE (School Based Gifted Education), and the Integrated Programme. ACS(I) offers the first four years of the Integrated Programme together with their affiliate, Methodist Girls' School, which allows students to proceed directly to ACS(I) (Year 5-6) without taking the GCE 'O' Levels to complete the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. ==History== Aerial view of the school, before the construction of the new apartment-styled boarding block: (from left to right) sports complex, boarding school, original main building, IB block Aerial Panorama of Anglo Chinese School Independent in Dover Road, Singapore. Shot 2016. ACS was offered 'independent' status by Singapore's Ministry of Education in 1987. This was accepted by the ACS Board of Governors. In 1992, the school moved to a new campus at Dover Road. The site was opened by Dr Richard Hu, Minister of Finance of Singapore, on 1 March 1993, the 107th anniversary of the school's founding by Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham.ACS History . Retrieved 27 August 2007. Amoy Street, the original premises of ACS ACS was founded on 1 March 1886 by Bishop Oldham, as an extension of the Methodist Church. Its first location was a shophouse at 70 Amoy Street with a total of 13 pupils. Its name came from the fact that it conducted lessons in English at night and Chinese in the afternoon. By the following year, enrolment had increased to 104, and the school moved to Coleman Street. Between 1914 and 1920, led by the Rev. J.S. Nagle, the school introduced regular religious services and physical education classes. Afternoon classes were also established for academically weaker pupils. In a bid to ensure continuity in school life and keep the school adequately staffed, Nagle encouraged ex-students, known as old boys, to return to the school as teachers. To this day, the Anglo-Chinese School Old Boys' Association is a link through which old boys may keep ties with the school. The Anglo-Chinese Continuation School was started by the new principal, the Rev. P.L. Peach, in 1925, for students who had to leave the school due to the newly imposed age limits on school-going boys by the government. Eventually, ACS was renamed the Oldham Methodist School. A secondary school was opened at Cairnhill Road. Between 1942 and 1945, the Japanese occupied Singapore during World War II. During the Occupation, lessons were suspended, and the school re-opened its doors only in 1946, a year after the Japanese surrender, when the buildings at Cairnhill and Coleman Street were made safe from war damage. The pre-war principal, T.W. Hinch, who had been interned by the Japanese, returned to the school. He set up \\"X\\" and \\"Y\\" classes, each with different levels of difficulty, for students who had missed years of their education due to the Occupation. In September 1950, the secondary school moved from Cairnhill to Barker Road. Also in 1950, Post School Certificate Classes, later known as Pre-University Classes because they were supposed to prepare students for tertiary education, were set up, and the first batch of girl students was enrolled in ACS. Students in the lower grades continued to be all-male, a practice which persists to this day. Thio Chan Bee, the first Asian principal of ACS, took over in 1952. During his tenure, both the Cairnhill and Barker Road premises were expanded, the latter with the building of the Lee Hall, a three-storey building housing twelve classrooms and four laboratories. In 1986, ACS celebrated its centenary with the publication of a hardback history of the school entitled Hearts, Hopes and Aims. ACSP moved out of the Coleman Street campus in 1994; in its place now are the National Archives. In 1988 the Ministry of Education started its Independent School programme. Independent schools are allowed to be privately funded and subject to less government regulation in setting out their curriculum. The school was renamed ACS (Independent); in 1993 the Barker Road campus was vacated and the school moved to Dover Road. After strong lobbying by alumni, the Barker Road site was retained for a second secondary school. At the same time, Anglo-Chinese Primary School abandoned Coleman Street (the old building now housing the National Archives of Singapore) to share premises with the new secondary school at Barker Road, now named ACS (Barker Road). When Bishop Oldham started the school in 1886, he also took in some students as boarders. The boarding facility soon expanded and moved into ever-larger premises, first in Bellevue at Oldham Lane, then to Dunearn House at Barker Road. In 1986, when ACS celebrated its centennial year, the boarding school known as Oldham Hall moved into new premises within the ACS Barker Road campus. It moved back into the rebuilt premises in December 2002 and was renamed ACS Oldham Hall to emphasise its roots as a strong and vibrant member of the ACS family. ===Principals=== The principal of the school is also the school's Chief Executive Officer.Lau, Earnest. The ACS Story. Anglo-Chinese School Board of Governors, 2003, 2007 The first principal of the independent school was Lawrence Chia, an associate professor of chemistry at the National University of Singapore and a Presbyterian elder. Professor Chia stepped down at the end of 1993 and one of his two vice-principals was selected to replace him. Ong Teck Chin held the post from 1994 to October 2010. From 5 October 2010, Fanny Tan was appointed acting principal in his stead, until the appointment of Winston James Hodge as new principal with effect from 21 June 2011. Then, in December 2018, Arene Koh was appointed as principal. ===Awards=== ACS (Independent) was awarded the Singapore Quality Award (SQA) in October 2009.Letter to Parents , 5 January 2010. ACS (Independent) has achieved the Singapore Quality Award, all four Best Practice Awards, School Distinction and School Excellence Awards. ACS(I) has won The Straits Times' 'Top School in Sports (Boys)' award 14 times, starting with the first award in 1996 and winning thereafter every year until 2010, with the exception of 1999. It has been consistently ranked as one of the top secondary schools in Singapore. In the GCE 'Ordinary' level examinations, ACS(I) had been ranked in the top 15 institutions in Singapore for a number of years since 1995. In 2008 it was reported that ACS(I) students taking the IB exams for the first time had produced results among the best in the world: nine students had obtained the perfect score of 45, making up almost half the 20 candidates worldwide to do so. It was also reported that ACS(I)'s performance put it among the top three IB schools in the world. In 2010, 27 students worldwide were reported to have achieved the perfect score, of whom 13 came from the ACS(I) November 2009 examination cohort; in 2011, it produced 28 students who earned the perfect score. The number of perfect scorers increased to 29 in 2012 and 37 in 2013. In 2014, the school produced 32 of the 43 students nationwide who obtained perfect scores. In 2015, 34 students scored the perfect score. In 2016, 41 scored the perfect score, accounting for the 48 in Singapore and 81 worldwide to do so. In 2018 ACS scored an average of 41.6 points per IBDP student making it the top IB school in the world as per the league tables published by Education Advisers Ltd at https://www.ib-schools.com/page.asp?t=Global-Top-50 . ==CurriculumInternational Baccalaureate Diploma Programme=== The school was invited by the Ministry of Education to pioneer an Integrated Programme along with several other schools, targeted at high-achieving students. As these students are expected to attend university, the Ministry decided that it would benefit them to bypass GCE 'O' Level and sit directly for a pre-university examination. Accordingly, in 2004 ACS(I) began its Integrated Programme, adopting the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) to that end. Intakes for the Integrated Programme are at Years 1, 3 and 5. ACS(I) was also one of the first schools to offer the Gifted Education Programme, and is the only school that offers it alongside the Integrated Programme. From 2012 onwards, students from Methodist Girls' School will move to ACS(I) after their first four years, in year 5 to complete their 6-year IP leading to the IBDP with the ACS(I) batch, without taking the GCE \\"O\\" levels. Students who cannot cope with either of these may opt for the GCE 'O' Levels instead. The GEP is also offered in ACS(I)'s affiliate, Anglo- Chinese School (Primary). ====Year 1 & 2==== The overall programme consists of two main interdisciplinary academic strands; Strand 1 and 2 and other components such as Individualised Study Option (ISO), Philosophy of Disciplines (POD), National Education (NE), Pastoral Care & Career Guidance (PCCG), Physical Education (PE), Co-curricular Activities (CCA) and enrichment options. Strand 1 is focused on mathematics, physical sciences, life sciences, earth sciences, information sciences and technological studies and also contains elements of social sciences. Strand 2 is focused on the languages, language arts and literature, history and social studies and also contains elements of the performing arts in general. The Strand 2 curriculum was adapted from an ACS(I) GEP design. The remaining components include PE/CCA, NE/PCCG programmes and enrichment options designed to develop leadership ability and creativity. Specialised Art and Music electives, National Education, and affective/religious education are also included. Among subjects specially covered for the Integrated Programme in preparation for the year 5-6 IBDP, are Introduction to Human Societies (IHS), Language Arts (LA), and Philosophy of Disciplines (POD). They also have to complete a total of 120 hours of Creativity, Action, Service, and Leadership (CASL) and submit an Individualised Study Option (ISO) which prepares them for the IBDP's Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) and Extended Essay (EE). ====Year 3 & 4==== Years 3 and 4 utilize the same two-strand system, but with expanded scope and depth. In addition, an annual interdisciplinary colloquium is conducted where experts in different fields and teachers of various disciplines come together to discuss the similarities and differences of their subjects with each other and with the student participants. ====Year 5 & 6==== Year 5 and 6 utilize the IB Diploma Programme. Diploma students study six subjects from at least five out of six subject groups, concurrently over two years, as well as the core elements of the programme (Theory of Knowledge, the Extended Essay and Creativity, Action, Service). At least three, and not more than four of the six subjects selected are taken at higher level (HL), the others at standard level (SL). HL courses represent 240 teaching hours, and require a greater depth of study across a broader range of content in the subject. SL courses require 150 hours and provide breadth of study across the whole Diploma Programme. ===Other programmes=== Along with the default Integrated Programme, ACS offers the Foreign Language Programme, the Malay Special Programme(MSP),the Music Elective Programme (MEP) and the Regional Studies Programme (RSP), the latter two which are offered only by a few selected schools. ACS also offers the Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) (GEP) now known as the School-based Gifted Education (SBGE) for academically brilliant students, among the top 1% in the nation. In addition, ACS also offers a specialised subject combination in Years 3 & 4 called the Accelerated Science Programme (ASP). ==Culture and traditionAims=== The school's stated aim is to have every student be 'A Scholar, an Officer and a Gentleman'. The school motto, 'The Best Is Yet To Be', is taken from the second line of the poem by Robert Browning, Rabbi ben Ezra (1864),'Grow old along with me! / The best is yet to be...' Nicholson, D. H. S., and Lee, A. H. E., eds (1917). The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse. Oxford: The Clarendon Press. p. 106. and serves to encourage students to achieve greater heights by reminding them that their best achievements are yet to come. ===Uniform=== The Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) formal uniform is worn at all times. For male students, it consists of a white short-sleeved shirt, with either dark blue short trousers (for Year 1 to 3 students) or dark blue long trousers (for Year 4 to 6 male students). The shirt is always tucked in. Male students in Years 1 to 4 wear a dark blue tie with the ACS logo design on it. Males in Years 5 and 6 wear a striped tie with the school colours to distinguish them from the lower levels. Ties must be worn at all times during school hours. Female students in Year 5 and 6 wear a white short-sleeved shirt, untucked, with dark blue skirts. Yellow school scarves are worn on formal occasions. ===Anthem and coat of arms=== The school's anthem was adapted by teacher Henry Martyn Hoisington in 1926. It is adapted from the Canadian unofficial national anthem \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\". Drawing inspiration from the anthem, Dr Yap Pheng Geck designed the school arms in 1930. Placed in chief azure above the three letters of the school name is a golden creature with a lion's head, an eagle's wings and a dragon's body with claws, representing that the school was founded when Singapore was a British colony, by an American Methodist mission and during the Qing Dynasty in China. Technically, this creature is a heraldic wyvern, however, in a heritage talk to the year ones Vice Principal Patrick Soo has claimed that this is a misconception, referring it to just the 'ACS Creature'. The lower part of the field consists of two panels, blue and gold, which represent heaven and earth. The colours also symbolize both spiritual and material accomplishment. The letters \\"ACS\\" in red symbolize life forming a bridge between both; they also symbolize the blood of Christ uniting heaven and earth. In addition to the school name, the letters ACS are also variously said to spell out Academic achievements, Christian Character, and Sportsmanship or Service beyond self. Finally, the overall shield shape represents the knightly virtues of chivalry, honour, loyalty, valour and manliness. ===Discipline=== In 2001 then-Principal Ong told The Straits Times that \\"we have corporal punishment for some serious offences. But the rules are stated clearly in the school handbook and we have to be consistent in applying them.\\"Davie, Sandra (16 July 2001). \\"Want to complain about your child's teacher? Check facts first\\" . The Straits Times (Singapore). A publicity document for entry into the school's International Baccalaureate (IB) programme from age 16/17 to age 18/19 says that a punishment for violations of the school's academic honesty policy is \\"Caning(only for male students) which will be conducted in the Principal’s office, classroom or during school assembly.\\" \\"All students who have been caned will be required to attend counselling sessions arranged by the school\\". ==Student activitiesHouse system=== The clock tower The house system is a way of grouping students into mutually competitive groups. It was introduced on 16 April 1929 during the tenure of Principal Thomas W Hinch. ACS Houses were named initially after churchmen Bishop James Thoburn, Bishop William F Oldham, and Rev Goh Hood Keng; and philanthropists Tan Kah Kee and Cheong Koon Seng. In 2005, three other benefactors of the school were honoured by having houses named after them: these were Dr Lee Seng Gee, Dr Shaw Vee Meng and Tan Sri Dr Tan Chin Tuan.Moving Ahead In The New Year , Message from the Chairman of the ACS Board of Governors. February/March 2005. The houses in chronological order, and their house colours, are: * Thoburn - Green * Oldham - Red * Goh Hood Keng (GHK) - Yellow * Tan Kah Kee (TKK) - Dark Blue * Cheong Koon Seng (CKS) - Light Blue * Lee Seng Gee (LSG) - Grey * Shaw Vee Meng (SVM) - Purple * Tan Chin Tuan (TCT) - Tan/Orange ===Co-curricular Activities (CCA)=== The school has over 50 different CCAs, including more than 10 clubs and societies in diverse fields. Participation in 2 CCAs is compulsory for all pupils from Year 1 to 4. Each student participates in 2 CCAs: a Uniformed Group and either Sports, Service, Clubs and Societies or Cultural Activities. A notable exception to this 2 CCA policy is for Direct School Admission(DSA) students, who take the DSA CCA as their only CCA. The school also offers the usual suite of uniformed groups and a full range of performing arts and sports groups. ===ACS Old Boy's Association (OBA)=== The OBA was formed by accident rather by design when the Rev J S Nagle, Principal of ACS (1913 – 1922) was tasked with fulfilling Bishop William F Oldham’s vision of building an ACS College. The Rev Nagle contacted the Old Boys, some of whom were distinguished citizens holding prominent positions in society then, to garner their support to realise Bishop Oldham’s dream. Though this dream failed to materialize, the ACSOBA was formed. It was officially formed on 10 July 1914, 28 years after ACS was started at Amoy Street. The OBA provides a venue for the Old Boys to network among themselves as well as organizing events that have since become traditions such as the annual Founder’s Day Dinner. ==CampusFacilities=== ACS(I) has a number of facilities, including a campus-wide Wi-Fi network, air-conditioned classrooms, computer and science laboratories, multi-purpose halls, auditoriums, lecture theatres. ACS(I) is known for its sporting tradition and has numerous sports facilities, including an artificial turf, a gymnasium, swimming pools and basketball, squash and tennis courts. Sports Facilities IB Block === Boarding school === ACS (Independent) Boarding School Established in 1994, the ACS (Independent) Boarding School houses around 500 students, mostly overseas scholars from the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and India.

Boarders may also use the ACS(I) facilities The Warden of the Boarding School is the Principal of ACS(I), Deputy Wardens are Deputy Principals, and all Hall Masters and Hall Tutors are ACS(I) teachers ===The Shaw Library and Resource Centre=== The library is named after its financial benefactor, Runme Shaw. It contains over 100,000 books, reference materials and IB syllabus- based course books. The library was extended in 2007. ==AchievementsSports and games=== ACS (Independent) has achieved good sporting results through the years, having produced national champions and national sportsmen. It has been strong in swimming, sailing, water-polo and rugby. It has been The Straits Times' Top School in Sports (Boys) in an almost unbroken streak since this title was first awarded, from 1996 to 2009. The exception was 1999, in which The Chinese High School won the title. The record number of gold medals in a single season was achieved in 2018, where it won 17 gold medals and 10 silver medals. The school has held many winning streaks such as the \\"B\\" Division Rugby Title from 1997–2003 and the \\"C\\" Division Rugby Title from 1997–2009. In 2008, ACS (Independent) won a grand slam in Rugby, winning all three \\"A\\" Division, \\"B\\" Division and \\"C\\" Division titles. ====National inter- schools championships (1989 onwards; 2007 onwards for \\"A\\" Division)==== * Air pistolSchool Information Service , accessed 27 August 2007. ** \\"C\\" Division: 2019 ** \\"B\\" Division: 2006, 2009 ** \\"A\\" Division: 2010, 2018 * Air rifle ** \\"C\\" Division: 2003 ** \\"B\\" Division: 2010 * Badminton ** \\"C\\" Division: 1996, 1997,2017 ** \\"B\\" Division: 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1998 ** \\"A\\" Division: 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2019 *Basketball * Bowling ** \\"C\\" Division: 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011 ** \\"B\\" Division: 1995, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2016 * Canoeing ** \\"C\\" Division: 2000, 2004, 2010, 2013 ** \\"B\\" Division: 2000, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 ** \\"A\\" Division: 2008 * CricketACS (Independent) - Cricket.

The primary purpose of the road is to bypass a densely built commercial strip on Route 9 in the eastern part of Concord. Several times a year, I-393 also serves traffic to events at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon. I-393 runs concurrently with US 4 and US 202 for its entire length. ==Route description== Interstate 393 begins at I-93's exit 15 interchange, where US 4 East leaves its concurrency with I-93 South and the I-393/US 4/US 202 concurrency begins. The four-lane freeway actually begins a short distance west of I-93 at the north end of Concord's Main Street where US 202 turns east from US 3. From there the road then intersects Commercial Street just before the exit 15 interchange. Just east of the exit 15 cloverleaf is I-393's exit 1 to Fort Eddy Road. This exit provides access to NHTI, Concord's Community College, which is home to the McAuliffe- Shepard Discovery Center, an air and space science center. I-393 crosses the Merrimack River and continues east to exit 2, connecting to New Hampshire's State Office Park East and the area known locally as the Concord Heights via East Side Drive (NH 132). Further east is exit 3, I-393's last, to New Hampshire Route 106, which runs south past the commercial area around the Steeplegate Mall, and north to New Hampshire Motor Speedway and the Laconia region. After exit 3, the road turns northward, crossing the Soucook River into Pembroke. Beyond the bridge, I-393 ends and US 4 and US 202 merge down to a single lane before joining NH 9 and continuing eastward. ==History== When I-393 was first completed circa 1979, it ended at an at-grade intersection with NH 9 and NH 106 just west of where exit 3 now stands. Exit 3 and the extension beyond were completed in the late 1980s. A feasibility study conducted in the 1980s proposed a number of alignments that would have extended I-393 beyond its eastern terminus to a new interchange (Exit 10) on the Spaulding Turnpike between Dover and Rochester.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CZIC-te175-n48-1989/pdf/CZIC- te175-n48-1989.pdf This project studied the possibility of creating an east/west highway between Portsmouth and Concord. After much work, it was deemed impossible and an upgrade of U.S. Route 4, a road which closely follows the route of the first NH turnpike from the early 1800s, was studied and completed. The intersection of Commercial Street and US 202 used to be a four- way crossing, but in recent years Jersey barriers have been installed and a short bypass under US 202 has been constructed to prevent traffic from crossing the freeway, although the traffic lights remain. The lights on the westbound side have since been modified to become warning lights for the traffic signal at the intersection with US 3. ==Exit listReferences== Category:1979 establishments in New Hampshire Interstate 393 93-3 93-3 Category:U.S. Route 202 Category:U.S. Route 4 Category:Transportation in Merrimack County, New Hampshire ","title":"Interstate 393"},{"id":"2000174","text":"In computer science, the min conflicts algorithm is a search algorithm or heuristic method to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). Given an initial assignment of values to all the variables of a CSP, the algorithm randomly selects a variable from the set of variables with conflicts violating one or more constraints of the CSP. Then it assigns to this variable the value that minimizes the number of conflicts. If there is more than one value with a minimum number of conflicts, it chooses one randomly. This process of random variable selection and min-conflict value assignment is iterated until a solution is found or a pre-selected maximum number of iterations is reached. Because a CSP can be interpreted as a local search problem when all the variables have an assigned value (called a complete state), the min conflicts algorithm can be seen as a repair heuristic that chooses the state with the minimum number of conflicts. ==Algorithm== algorithm MIN-CONFLICTS is input: csp, A constraint satisfaction problem. max_steps, The number of steps allowed before giving up. current_state, An initial assignment of values for the variables in the csp. output: A solution set of values for the variable or failure. for i <- 1 to max_steps do if current_state is a solution of csp then return current_state set var <- a randomly chosen variable from the set of conflicted variables CONFLICTED[csp] set value <- the value v for var that minimizes CONFLICTS(var,v,current_state,csp) set var <- value in current_state return failure Although not specified in the algorithm, a good initial assignment can be critical for quickly approaching a solution. Use a greedy algorithm with some level of randomness and allow variable assignment to break constraints when no other assignment will suffice. The randomness helps min- conflicts avoid local minima created by the greedy algorithm's initial assignment. In fact, Constraint Satisfaction Problems that respond best to a min-conflicts solution do well where a greedy algorithm almost solves the problem. Map coloring problems do poorly with Greedy Algorithm as well as Min- Conflicts. Sub areas of the map tend to hold their colors stable and min conflicts cannot hill climb to break out of the local minimum. The function counts the number of constraints violated by a particular object, given that the state of the rest of the assignment is known. ==History== Although Artificial Intelligence and Discrete Optimization had known and reasoned about Constraint Satisfaction Problems for many years, it was not until the early 1990s that this process for solving large CSPs had been codified in algorithmic form. Early on, Mark Johnston of the Space Telescope Science Institute looked for a method to schedule astronomical observations on the Hubble Space Telescope. In collaboration with Hans-Martin Adorf of the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility, he created a neural network capable of solving a toy n-queens problem (for 1024 queens). Steven Minton and Andy Philips analyzed the neural network algorithm and separated it into two phases: (1) an initial assignment using a greedy algorithm and (2) a conflict minimization phases (later to be called \\"min-conflicts\\"). A paper was written and presented at AAAI-90; Philip Laird provided the mathematical analysis of the algorithm. Subsequently, Mark Johnston and the STScI staff used min- conflicts to schedule astronomers' observation time on the Hubble Space Telescope. ==Example== Animation of min-conflicts resolution of 8-queens. First stage assigns columns greedily minimizing conflicts, then solves Min- Conflicts solves the N-Queens Problem by randomly selecting a column from the chess board for queen reassignment. The algorithm searches each potential move for the number of conflicts (number of attacking queens), shown in each square. The algorithm moves the queen to the square with the minimum number of conflicts, breaking ties randomly. Note that the number of conflicts is generated by each new direction that a queen can attack from. If two queens would attack from the same direction (row, or diagonal) then the conflict is only counted once. Also note that if a queen is in a position in which a move would put it in greater conflict than its current position, it does not make a move. It follows that if a queen is in a state of minimum conflict, it does not have to move. This algorithm's run time for solving N-Queens is independent of problem size. This algorithm will even solve the million-queens problem on average of 50 steps. This discovery and observations led to a great amount of research in 1990 and began research on local search problems and the distinctions between easy and hard problems. N-Queens is easy for local search because solutions are densely distributed throughout the state space. It is also effective for hard problems. For example, it has been used to schedule observations for the Hubble Space Telescope, reducing the time taken to schedule a week of observations from three weeks to around 10 minutes.Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig, “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)”, pp. 220-222, December 11, 2009. ==See also== * Warnsdorff's algorithm * Eight queens Puzzle * Guided Local Search ==References== * Stuart J.

(\\"The Pythian Apollo, called the Belvedere Apollo\\") is a celebrated marble sculpture from Classical Antiquity. The Apollo is now thought to be an original Roman re-creation of Hadrianic date (ca. 120–140). The distinctively Roman foot-wear is one reason scholars believe it is not a copy of an original Greek statue. It was rediscovered in central Italy in the late 15th century during the Italian Renaissance and was placed on semi-public display in the Vatican Palace in 1511, where it remains. It is now in the Cortile del Belvedere of the Pio-Clementine Museum of the Vatican Museums complex. From the mid-18th century it was considered the greatest ancient sculpture by ardent neoclassicists, and for centuries it epitomized the ideals of aesthetic perfection for Europeans and westernized parts of the world. == Description == alt= The Greek god Apollo is depicted as a standing archer having just shot an arrow. Although there is no agreement as to the precise narrative detail being depicted, the conventional view has been that he has just slain the serpent Python, the chthonic serpent guarding Delphi—making the sculpture a Pythian Apollo. Alternatively, it may be the slaying of the giant Tityos, who threatened his mother Leto, or the episode of the Niobids. The large white marble sculpture is 2.24 m (7.3 feet) high. Its complex contrapposto has been much admired, appearing to position the figure both frontally and in profile. The arrow has just left Apollo's bow and the effort impressed on his musculature still lingers. His hair, lightly curled, flows in ringlets down his neck and rises gracefully to the summit of his head, which is encircled with the strophium, a band symbolic of gods and kings. His quiver is suspended across his left shoulder. He is entirely nude except for his sandals and a robe (chlamys) clasped at his right shoulder, turned up on his left arm, and thrown back. The lower part of the right arm and the left hand were missing when discovered and were restored by Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli (1507–1563), a sculptor and pupil of Michelangelo. == Modern history == Head of Apollo, modeled on the Apollo Belvedere (Marble, Roman copy of ca. 120–140 AD), once in the collection of Vincenzo Giustiniani and James- Alexandre de Pourtalès (British Museum) === Renaissance === Detail Before its installation in the Cortile delle Statue of the Belvedere palace in the Vatican, the Apollo—which seems to have been discovered in 1489 in the present territory of Anzio (at that time territory of Nettuno), or perhaps at Grottaferrata where Giuliano della Rovere was abbot in commendamRoberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford University Press) 1969:103 first noted the entries in 1489 and a repetition in 1493 in the somewhat chaotic Cesena chronicle of Giuliano Fantaguzzi.—apparently received very little notice from artists.H. H. Brummer, The Statue Court in the Vatican Belvedere (Stockholm) 1970:44–71, which gives the most concise review of the statue's discovery and its history. It was, however, sketched twice during the last decade of the 15th century in the book of drawings by a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio, now at the Escorial.Weiss 1969:103. Though it has always been known to have belonged to Giuliano della Rovere before he became pope, as Julius II, its placement has been confused until as recently as 1986:Deborah Brown, \\"The Apollo Belvedere and the Garden of Giuliano della Rovere at SS. Apostoli\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 49 (1986), pp. 235–238. Cardinal della Rovere, who held the titulus of San Pietro in Vincoli, stayed away from Rome for the decade during Alexander VI's papacy (1494–1503); in the interim, the Apollo stood in his garden at SS. Apostoli, Deborah Brown has shown, and not at his titular church, as had been assumed. Once it was installed in the Cortile, however, it immediately became famous in artistic circles and a demand for copies of it arose. The Mantuan sculptor Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi, called \\"L'Antico\\", made a careful wax model of it, which he cast in bronze, finely finished and partly gilded, to figure in the Gonzaga collection, and in further copies in a handful of others. Albrecht Dürer reversed the Apollo's pose for his Adam in a 1504 engraving of Adam and Eve, suggesting that he saw it in Rome. When L'Antico and Dürer saw it, the Apollo was probably still in the personal collection of della Rovere, who, once he was pope as Julius II, transferred the prize in 1511 to the small sculpture court of the Belvedere, the palazzetto or summerhouse that was linked to the Vatican Palace by Bramante's large Cortile del Belvedere. It became the Apollo of the Cortile del Belvedere, and the name has remained with it, though the sculpture has long been indoors, in the Museo Pio-Clementino at the Vatican Museums, Rome. In addition to Dürer, several major artists during the late Renaissance sketched the Apollo, including Michelangelo, Bandinelli, and Goltzius. In the 1530s it was engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi, whose printed image transmitted the famous pose throughout Europe. === 18th century === The Apollo became one of the world's most celebrated art works when in 1755 it was championed by the German art historian and archaeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768) as the best example of the perfection of the Greek aesthetic ideal. Its \\"noble simplicity and quiet grandeur\\", as he described it, became one of the leading lights of neoclassicism and an icon of the Enlightenment. Goethe, Schiller and Byron all endorsed it.Barkan, Op. cit., pg 56. The Apollo was one of the artworks brought to Paris by Napoleon after his 1796 Italian Campaign. From 1798 it formed part of the collection of the Louvre during the First Empire, but was returned after 1815. === 19th century === The neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova adapted the work's fluency to his marble Perseus (Vatican Museums) in 1801. After the fall of Napoleon (1815), the Apollo was repatriated to the VaticanGregory Curtis, Disarmed, (New York: Knopf, 2003) pp. 57–61. where it has remained ever since. The Romantic movement was not so kind to the Apollo's critical reputation. William Hazlitt (1778–1830), one of the great critics of the English language, was not impressed and dismissed it as \\"positively bad\\". The eminent art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900) wrote of his disappointment with it. Finally, starting something of a trend among later commentators, the art critic Walter Pater (1839–1894) adverted to the work's homoerotic appeal by way of explaining why it had been so long lionized. Nevertheless, the work retained much popular appeal and casts of it were abundant in European and American public places (especially schools) throughout the 19th century. === 20th century === The Apollo Belvedere was featured in the official logo of the Apollo 17 Moon landing mission (1972) The critical reputation of the Apollo continued to decline in the 20th century, ultimately to the point of complete neglect. In 1969 a kind of epitaph was provided by the art historian Kenneth Clark (1903–1983): > \\"...For four hundred years after it was discovered the Apollo was the most > admired piece of sculpture in the world. It was Napoleon's greatest boast to > have looted it from the Vatican.

Cottrell in 1972. He argued that we quickly learn that the social rewards and punishments (for example, in the form of approval and disapproval) that we receive from other people are based on their evaluations of us. On this basis, our arousal may be modulated. In other words, performance will be enhanced or impaired only in the presence of persons who can approve or disapprove of our actions. Feelings of concern about evaluation nearly always occur when in the presence of others. However, in 1968, Cottrell tried to separate these variables in an experiment. He found that there was no social facilitation effect on three well-learned tasks performed by a participant when there were two other persons (part of the study) blindfolded and supposedly preparing for a perception study. The participants would perform the same as the participants who were to perform the three well-learned tasks alone. Dominant responses (sharper and quicker) were given mainly by participants who had to perform the three tasks in the presence of spectators who seemed interested and who were able to see the participant perform the tasks. People may experience evaluation apprehension when they are part of a negatively stereotyped group and involved in a stereotype-linked activity. For example, women taking a math test may not perform to their full potential because of concerns regarding women's stereotyped difficulties with math. In this situation, evaluation apprehension is called stereotype threat. Stereotype threat can also occur in private, whereas evaluation apprehension cannot. Evaluation apprehension can affect subjects' behavior in psychological experiments, and can lead to invalid causal inference. Rosenberg defined evaluation apprehension as \\"an active, anxiety-toned concern that he [the subject] win a positive evaluation from the experimenter, or at least that he provide no grounds for a negative one.\\" As a result, subjects have conformed less in conformity studies and exhibited quicker conditioning in conditioning studies as part of a positive self-presentation. Other research on evaluation apprehension has shown that, when they must make a choice, subjects are more concerned with presenting themselves in a favorable light (this has been called the apprehensive hypothesis, the \\"good subject role\\"). Concern with giving a positive self- presentation is also implicit in the social desirability bias. This bias is the tendency to give the \\"socially desired response\\" (e.g., a response that would typically be considered well-adjusted) in answering items on personality measures. This response set is important for personality researchers because it threatens valid interpretation of test results. ==The manipulation of evaluation apprehension== To study the causal influence of evaluation apprehension in experimental designs, experimenters frequently have to try to manipulate this variable. By creating differing levels of evaluation apprehension, researchers can assess its effect on, and interaction with, other variables, such as self-esteem and manifest anxiety. To heighten participants' evaluation apprehension, experimenters create situations in which participants perceive themselves as being publicly judged. For example, Kim et al. (2010)'s tested the effect of apprehension on making positive self- evaluations. Specifically, they studied the effect of evaluation apprehension between two groups: people from collectivistic cultures and people from individualistic cultures. To manipulate evaluation apprehension, they raised and lowered the level of evaluation apprehension depending on if participants were alone or with a group of people when they were asked to make positive self-evaluations. An indirect manipulation of evaluation apprehension is demonstrated in Leary et al. (1987)'s study of evaluation apprehension on social-esteem and self-esteem. One's social-esteem is how one is evaluated by others, or at least how one perceives that one is being perceived by others. Until recently, scholars hypothesized that the model of social-esteem directly contrasted the model of self-esteem, one's evaluation of oneself. There is some consensus that social-esteem is influenced by evaluation apprehension given that they are both related to a person's apprehension of being evaluated by others. However, recent research shows that evaluation apprehension can also influence general self-esteem. Leary et al. conducted an experiment in which participants were told that they would be taking a test that could threaten their ego and that either \\"only they, only another individual, both they and the other individual, or no one would see their test score\\". By varying the perceived audience, the researchers indirectly manipulated evaluation apprehension. Leary et al. thus hoped to create conditions that tested the effects of differing levels of evaluation apprehension on social- esteem and self-esteem. Before the test began, the participants were all assessed on their level of evaluation apprehension. The purpose of the study was then to determine how one's evaluation apprehension was affected by a threat to one's self-esteem, social-esteem, both, or neither. The results of Leary et al. (1987)'s study showed a significant increase in evaluation apprehension for participants with both the self-viewing condition and the peer-viewing condition. Participants in the peer-viewing condition were told that they would be evaluated by others; participants in the self-viewing condition were told that they would be evaluated by themselves. This effect was similarly found for the self-viewing and social-viewing condition, but not for the condition in which no one would view the results. These results demonstrate that one may be able to alter evaluation apprehension by manipulating social-esteem and self-esteem. ==Evaluation apprehension as a moderator== Recent research has shown that there is a negative correlation between social desirability and manifest anxiety. Studies have demonstrated that evaluation apprehension may moderate this relationship. When evaluation apprehension is lowered, a much smaller relationship between these two variables is found. Therefore, evaluation apprehension is positively correlated to the relationship between social desirability and manifest anxiety. This does not imply that evaluation apprehension is the reason why a person has more anxiety when they have more social desirability. However, this correlation does imply that someone with high desirability is more likely to have manifest anxiety when there is high evaluation apprehension rather than in cases of low evaluation apprehension. Other studies have revealed that there is a relationship between collectivism and corruption. Recent research has shown that evaluation apprehension may moderate this association. Collectivistic values and one's willingness to act in a corrupted way positively correlate in some studies and negatively correlate in others. Researchers are unsure how to interpret these mixed results. However, Huang et al. (2015) believed that evaluation apprehension was the third variable that was moderating the relationship. They hypothesized that there would be a negative correlation between collectivism and corruption when evaluation apprehension was high because of the fear of being judged for being corrupt by the other people of one's culture. On the other hand, they hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation when evaluation apprehension was low because people would have low fear of judgment from others for being corrupt. Therefore, the researchers conducted an experiment that tested the relationship between collectivism and corruption with the independent variable being evaluation apprehension. All of the conditions in the experiment contained situations where collectivistic values and one's willingness to act corruptly were tested, the conditions only differed in the amount of evaluation apprehension they contained. Numerous experiments were completed by Huang et al. and the experiment based on bribery scenarios found corroborating results with the experiment based on a bribery game containing real money. Both experiments produced significant results which indicate that collectivism only facilitated corruption when there was low evaluation apprehension. Although this is only one study, the fact that high levels of evaluation apprehension inhibit collectivism facilitating corruption provides further supporting evidence that evaluation apprehension can sometimes act as a moderator. ==The effects of evaluation apprehension on behavior== The presence of evaluation apprehension can cause some people to act abnormally. Their behavior may be altered from the norm by increasing evaluation apprehension even if the rest of the context remains unchanged. Evaluation apprehension can change behavior both beneficially and detrimentally in laboratory and work settings. Recent research has suggested that at times the true effects of a treatment being tested in an experiment can be influenced by evaluation apprehension. Sometimes, the participants' knowledge that they are in an experiment leads them to experience evaluation apprehension. Their apprehensive feelings of being evaluated results in them acting in a different manner than they would in normal life, thereby leading to false data. Evaluation apprehension can affect the behavior of people differently depending on their culture and other factors. Research indicates that evaluation apprehension is a primary determinant of individual differences in the ability to make positive self-evaluations among Western and Eastern cultures. Western cultures tend to be more individualistic in nature and therefore the people of those cultures have an easier time making public, positive self-evaluations. The individualistic nature of those cultures encourages people who reside in them to make public, positive self-evaluations because of a lack of social/societal judgment when they do. Eastern cultures, on the other hand, tend to be more collectivistic in nature and therefore the people of those cultures are less likely to make public, positive self- evaluations than they are to make private self-evaluations. This may be due to evaluation apprehension. The collectivistic nature of those cultures discourages praising oneself, so such people are discouraged from public self- praise from fear of being evaluated negatively. Studies have revealed that when these people are in a more private setting where they do not have evaluation apprehension they are more likely to make positive self- evaluations. ==Benefits and detriments of evaluation apprehension== Although it is commonly believed that evaluation apprehension is largely detrimental, research demonstrates that evaluation apprehension can have both positive and negative effects on social interactions. Evaluation apprehension can be useful at times in spite of its tendency to create anxiety. At high levels, evaluation apprehension can inform people that the situation is important and that they should focus attention on whatever stressor is causing the heightened levels of evaluation apprehension. Research indicates that a person is less easily distracted when they have a heightened level of evaluation apprehension and can therefore be more easily persuaded. Eliminating such distraction creates a higher level of understanding of the presented argument. At the same time, this heightened level of attention can create anxiety. Thus, evaluation apprehension leads to an amplified level of attention that is both beneficial and detrimental. ==See also== * Audience effect * Drive theory ==References== Category:Group processes ","title":"Evaluation apprehension model"},{"id":"2000185","text":"The ArmaLite AR-50 is a .50 BMG, single-shot, bolt-action anti-material precision rifle manufactured by ArmaLite.

Castronovo (born August 17, 1964) is an American drummer and singer, best known for being a member of classic rock band Journey and hard rock acts Bad English, Revolution Saints, and The Dead Daisies. He also has been a touring and studio member for Ozzy Osbourne, Steve Vai, Paul Rodgers, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler's GZR, Hardline, and others. ==Early life== Deen Castronovo was born in the city of Westminster, California and started drumming at the age of 6. He grew up in Keizer, Oregon., where he attended South Salem High School. Deen cites Steve Smith, Neil Peart, Terry Bozzio, Kiss, Rush, Van Halen and AC/DC as musical influences. ==Career== Castronovo is the former drummer for bands Wild Dogs, Bad English, Journey and is the current drummer for Revolution Saints and The Dead Daisies. He also played on the song \\"Smoke of the Revolution\\" on the Neal Schon solo album Late Nite (1989). ===Wild Dogs (1982-1987)=== Wild Dogs is an America rock band from Portland, Oregon formed loosely in 1981 by Jeff Mark, Danny Kurth, Matt McCourt, and Pete Holmes. Drummer Pete Holmes was lured away by Black 'n Blue and was replaced by Jaime St. James. The band had an appearance on a compilation series, but before a full album could be recorded with Shrapnel Records, St. James left the band to also join Black 'n Blue. It was at this point Deen was first discovered by McCourt, who recruited the local, and then only 16-year-old drummer Castronovo to join the band. Deen played on the self- titled debut album Wild Dogs (1983), the followup Man's Best Friend (1984) and Reign Of Terror (1987). The band was known for its live show, that featured McCourt's props and Castronovo's showmanship. ===Bad English (1987-1991)=== While working with Wild Dogs, Deen met and began working with Tony MacAlpine, which led to an introduction to future long-time collaboration partner, Neal Schon. Shortly after, Neal would invite Deen to audition for a new band with Jonathan Cain, John Waite and Ricky Phillips, which became Bad English. After two albums, which included being nominated for Best New Group in 1989 at the International Rock Awards, Bad English disbanded in 1991. In 1995 a Greatest Hits was released. ===Hardline (1991-1992)=== Again working with Neal Schon, Deen played drums and sang backing vocals on Hardline's debut album Double Eclipse. The album's first single \\"Takin' Me Down\\" peaked at No. 37 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album's second single, a cover of the Danny Spanos song \\"Hot Cherie,\\" rose to No. 25 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. ===Ozzy Osbourne (1995)=== Deen appeared on the 1995 release Ozzmosis, the seventh solo studio album by Ozzy Osbourne. The album reached number 22 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US Billboard 200. Deen also toured with Ozzy on a portion of the 1995 leg of the Retirement Sucks Tour. ===Journey (1998-2015)=== Journey, Live in Minneapolis, Minnesota on September 16, 2008 Deen continued to be in various bands along with Schon, from Hardline to Paul Rodgers. After a 3-year stint with Vasco Rossi, he joined Journey, where he would spend the next 18 years and 5 albums as the drummer, backing and occasional lead vocalist. While not the original drummer for Journey, Deen is the longest-serving drummer to date, having played on the albums Arrival (2001), Red 13 (2002), Generations (2005), Revelation (2008), and Eclipse (2011). As a vocalist, he sang \\"Still They Ride\\", \\"Mother, Father\\" and \\"Keep On Runnin'\\" (and on rare occasions, \\"Faithfully\\" and \\"Where Were You\\") in concert in order to let the main lead vocalists take a break. In the studio, he performed lead vocals on \\"A Better Life\\" and \\"Never Too Late\\", which were featured on Generations. Castronovo was fired by Journey in August 2015 following a June 2015 domestic violence arrest. He was replaced by Omar Hakim on the band's 2015 tour, with longtime drummer Steve Smith subsequently rejoining the band. ===Soul SirkUS (2004-2005)=== After the Planet Us project did not produce an album, Neal Schon was determined to see the material he had written come to life. At the 2004 annual NAMM Show in Los Angeles, Schon met up with Jeff Scott Soto and tested the waters with a jam session. While in Los Angeles, Schon also attended a showcase featuring Marco Mendoza. Inviting Soto, Mendoza and Deen Castronovo to join him, the new band, Soul SirkUS, began rehearsing and eventually recorded 11 songs for their debut album, World Play. Although all the foundation tracks on the album were originally written for Planet Us, only one completed song from that band was used for Soul SirkUS debut. In early 2005, with a completed album titled World Play (the \\"black sleeve\\" version) the band was ready to tour, but Castronovo fell ill due to extreme exhaustion. Soon after, Castronovo bowed out of Soul SirkUS based on his doctor's recommendation and was replaced by Australian drummer Virgil Donati. Ultimate there were 3 editions of the album. The Black Sleeve version was the original with Deen drumming, the Green Sleeve version was an American edition remastered, the Yellow Sleeve had two versions: a European edition of remaster that included a bonus DVD, and a Japanese edition of the remaster included a bonus track. The Black Sleeve version is the only one with Deen. ===Revolution Saints (2014-present)=== While still with Journey, Deen, Jack Blades (Night Ranger, Damn Yankees and Shaw Blades), and Doug Aldrich (Whitesnake, Dio, The Dead Daisies) formed Revolution Saints. The band, where Deen served as lead vocalist and handled drumming duties, released its self-titled debut album on February 24, 2015. A follow-up album, Light in the Dark, was released on October 13, 2017. The album was ranked #8 on Dr. Music's 2017 \\"Album of the Year\\" list. ===The Dead Daisies (2017-present)=== The Dead Daisies in 2017 On November 4, 2017, it was announced that Deen would become the new drummer for The Dead Daisies, replacing Brian Tichy. Deen and the band almost immediately began song writing and hit the studio, again with producer Marti Frederiksen (Aerosmith, Gavin Rossdale, Mötley Crüe, Buckcherry), to record a follow-up to the successful Make Some Noise (2016) album and Live & Louder (2017) release. The new album, Burn It Down was released April 6, 2018 in multiple formats including: CD, colored vinyl, picture disk vinyl and digital download. The band began a 26-date UK and European tour April 8, 2018 in Glasgow, UK. ===Gioeli-Castronovo (2017-present)=== Johnny Gioeli and Deen Castronovo first played together on the debut Hardline album, \\"Double Eclipse\\", which was released in 1992. 25 years later, the two were reunited in Italy to commence work on the debut Gioeli-Castronovo album, \\"Set The World On Fire\\", available July 13, 2018. Both men have continued on their musical paths since they last saw one another, with Gioeli continuing to lead Hardline as well as being the lead singer of Crush 40 and Axel Rudi Pell's band, while Castronovo spent time with various bands. ===Other projects=== Deen's first big gig came at the age of 16 with a band called The Enemy, who opened up for bands like Blue Öyster Cult and Foghat. He has played in Cacophony, Dr. Mastermind, Planet Us (a short-lived supergroup with Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony, Joe Satriani and Neal Schon), Social Distortion, and GZR (formed by Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler), as well as in backing bands for Vasco Rossi, Paul Rodgers, and Matthew Ward. After working with Paul Rodgers, he began doing session work with Steve Vai, whom with he made two albums. Steve later called for him to audition for Ozzy Osbourne, which resulted in him recording Ozzmosis and doing a South American Tour with Ozzy.

In a 5-4 split, the Supreme Court held that the oncomouse and higher life forms in general are not patentable subject matter in Canada. == Background == Harvard College researchers (the respondents) developed a process by which they could create transgenic animals whose genomes are altered by a cancer-promoting gene (called an activated oncogene).Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 123 The researchers injected the oncogene into fertilized mouse eggs close to the one- cell stage and implanted them into a female host mouse where they developed to term.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 122 The resulting offspring were then tested for the presence or absence of the oncogene. Those with the gene are referred to as \\"founder\\" mice and are mated with unaltered mice. Offspring that contain the oncogene and have every cell in their body affected (including germ cells and somatic cells) by it are referred to as oncomice. Oncomice are useful for carcinogenic studies as they are more susceptible to carcinogens.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 121 Such mice can be given material suspected of being a carcinogen and if tumours develop, it is an indication that the material is carcinogenic. === Initial Patent Application and Trial === In 1985, the President and Fellows of Harvard College applied for a patent for an invention called \\"transgenic animals.\\" In particular, they applied for a process patent for the process by which they created the mice as well as a product patent for the end product of the process, namely the \\"founder\\" mice and the oncomice, offspring whose cells are affected by the gene. These patent claims also extend to all non-human mammals whose genomes have been altered in a similar manner. Patent applications on the oncomouse were filed in many countries including the United States, Canada, Europe (through the European Patent Office) and Japan. In March 1993, the Patent Examiner rejected the product claims (Claims 1 to 12) on the grounds that higher life forms were outside the definition of \\"invention\\" in section 2 of the Canadian Patent ActPatent Act, RSC 1985, c P-4, s.2. and are therefore not patentable subject matter.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 126 The process claims (Claims 13 to 26) were allowed.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 125 In August 1995, the Commissioner of Patents and the Patent Appeal Board upheld the refusal to grant a patent for the product claims.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 130 This decision was upheld by the Federal Court, Trial Division,Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 135 but was overturned by a majority of the Federal Court of Appeal. The Commissioner of Patents appeals from that decision. ===Federal Court of Appeal=== The majority of the court reversed the decision of the Federal Court and directed the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent covering claims 1 to 12 of the Patent Application. Speaking for the majority, Rothstein J.A. emphasized the object of the Patent Act, which is to \\"promote the development of inventions in a manner that benefits both the inventor and the public.\\"President and Fellows of Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), [2000] 4 FC 528 at para 106 He stated that the Commissioner has no discretion to refuse to grant a patent under s.40 of the Act and if a process or product satisfies the requirements of the Act, a patent must be granted.Harvard College [2000] 4 FC 528 at para 109 Additionally, the Patent Act does not explicitly exclude living organisms such as non-human mammals from the definition of \\"invention.\\"Harvard College [2000] 4 FC 528 at para 123 The majority concluded that the oncomouse \\"must be considered to be the result of both ingenuity and the laws of nature\\"Harvard College [2000] 4 FC 528 at para 129 and is an invention within the meaning of s.2 of the Patent Act, as it is both unobvious and a new and useful \\"composition of matter.\\"Harvard College [2000] 4 FC 528 at para 114 Isaac J.A. in dissent, approved of the approach taken by the Patent Examiner and concluded that the Commissioner of Patents must be aware of and take into consideration the public interest.Harvard College [2000] 4 FC 528 at para 54 He states that in a morally divisive case such as the one at hand, the court should defer to the Commissioner's decision to refuse to grant a patent. Leave was granted to the Supreme Court on June 14, 2001. == Supreme Court Ruling == The court found in favour of the government, ruling that higher life forms are not patentable. The opinion of the court was written by Bastarache J. with L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Iacobucci, and LeBel JJ. concurring. The sole question before the court was whether the words \\"manufacture\\" or \\"composition of matter,\\" in the context of the Patent Act, are broad enough to encompass higher life forms such as the oncomouse.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 146 The court found that they are not. Bastarache J. stated that the determination of the patentability of higher life forms such as the oncomouse is beyond the authority of the court and would be a massive change in the current patent regime. The majority indicated that as there are significant public policy concerns at play, Parliament is best suited to address this issue.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 153 === The Commissioner’s Power to Refuse a Patent under Section 40=== Though the court believed that the Commissioner went beyond his powers in ruling against a patent on public policy reasons, the court came to the same conclusion in denying the patentability of higher life forms such as the oncomouse. The majority stated that s.40 of the Patent Act does not give the Commissioner any discretion to refuse to grant a patent on the basis of public policy considerations, echoing Pigeon J.’s statement in Monsanto Co. v. Commissioner of Patents.Monsanto Co. v. Commissioner of Patents, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1108 at para 144 In terms of the standard of review, the majority believed that the question of whether higher life forms are included in the definition of \\"invention\\" in the Patent Act is reviewable on a correctness standard.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 148-150 ===The Definition of \\"Invention\\": Whether a Higher Life Form Is a \\"Manufacture\\" or a \\"Composition of Matter\\"==(a) The Words of the Act==== In s.2, the Patent Act defines an \\"invention\\" as \\"any new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter.\\" The majority concluded that although the definition of \\"invention\\" is broad, it does not include \\"anything under the sun that is made by man.\\"Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 158 The majority held that the words \\"manufacture\\" and \\"composition of matter\\" are not sufficiently broad to include a higher life form such as the oncomouse.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 155 The court is of the opinion that \\"manufacture\\" denotes \\"a non-living mechanistic product or process\\"Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 159 and does not imply a conscious, sentient living creature.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 160 The majority determined that the meaning of \\"composition of matter\\" can be ascertained by reference to the meaning of the words or phrases associated with them and thus is best read as not including higher life forms.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 161 The majority also referred to the Oxford English Dictionary definition of \\"composition\\" which is \\"a substance or preparation formed by combination or mixture of various ingredients\\" and concluded that the oncomouse cannot be understood in such terms.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 162 They also emphasized that higher life forms have unique qualities and characteristics that transcend the particular genetic matter of which they are composed.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 163 More generally, the court is of the opinion that allowing patents on higher life forms would involve \\"a radical departure from the traditional patent regime\\" and it is for to Parliament to determine whether higher life forms are patentable.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 166 ====(b) The Scheme of the Act==== The majority determined that the Patent Act, in its current form, is \\"ill-equipped to deal appropriately with higher life forms as patentable subject matter\\" since biological life forms are living, capable of self-replication, incredibly complex, incapable of full description, and can contain important characteristics having nothing to do with the invention.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 167 and 184 Justice Bastarache identified some of the serious issues surrounding the patentability of higher life forms including: the agricultural impact on farmers who wish to save and reuse seeds,Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 171 the rights of the \\"innocent bystander,\\" who may come into possession of a patented organism by virtue of its ability to self-replicate and thus be subject to an infringement action,Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 172 deterrence of biomedical research and innovation,Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 173 and the potential for the commodification of human life, tissues and organs.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 176-182 ====(c) The Object of the Act==== The majority stated that the two central objects of the Patent Act are \\"to advance research and development and to encourage broader economic activity.\\"Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 185 Although those are broad objectives, they determined that Parliament did not leave the definition of \\"invention\\" open and neither the language nor scheme of the Act suit higher life forms.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 187 Thus, they held that Parliament did not intend to extend Patent monopoly rights over inventions related to higher life forms. ====(d) Related Legislation: The Plant Breeders’ Rights Act==== The majority used the fact that Parliament enacted the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Pioneer Hi-Bred Ltd. v. Commissioner of Patents[1987] 3 F.C. 8 to bolster their view that Parliament did not believe the Patent Act was tailored to include higher life forms.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 189 Bastarache J. stated that since Parliament enacted specialized legislation to deal with the issues surrounding crossbred plants, a subset of higher life forms, had they wished to extend patentability to other higher life forms, they would have likely done so at the time.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 193 ===Drawing the Line: Is it Defensible to Allow Patents on Lower Life Forms While Denying Patents on Higher Life Forms?=== In response to the respondent's argument that drawing a line between lower and higher life forms is indefensible, Justice Bastarache stated that the line is \\"defensible on the basis of common sense differences between the two\\" and reiterates that a parliamentary response is necessary.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 199 Moreover, he stated that the distinction can also be upheld because, unlike higher life forms, a lower life form can more easily be conceptualized as a \\"composition of matter\\" or \\"manufacture\\"Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 201 and 203 and microbes can be mass-produced like chemical compounds and will possess uniform properties and characteristics.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 202 == Dissent == A dissent written by Binnie J., with McLachlin C.J., Arbour, and Major JJ. concurring, agreed with the reasoning of the Federal Court of Appeal and were of the opinion that the engineered oncomouse is an \\"extraordinary scientific achievement\\" and an inventive \\"composition of matter\\" within the meaning of s.2 of the Patent Act.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 8 Additionally, Binnie J. stated that other jurisdictions with comparable legislation including the United States, Europe, Japan and New Zealand, among others, have held the oncomouse to be patentable.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 2 and 34 Binnie J. disagreed with the view of the Commissioner of Patents that at the time the Patent Act was enacted Parliament could not have intended genetically engineered higher life forms to be patentable.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 9 and 79 He stated that Parliament could not have contemplated many other future inventions including genetically engineered lower life forms, moon rockets, antibiotics, telephones, e-mail or hand-held computers.\\"Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 9 He argued that the Patent Act does not distinguish between higher and lower life forms and such a distinction is an invention of the Patent Office.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 47 He stated that efforts to draw the line between patentable lower life forms and \\"unpatentable\\" higher life forms highlight the arbitrariness of the approach.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 52-53 Justice Binnie stated that once it is conceded that the genetically altered oncomouse egg meets the criteria for patentability; there is no reason for denying patentability to the resulting oncomouse on the basis that it is not an \\"invention\\" as defined by the Patent Act.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 85-86 He stressed that s.40 of the Patent Act does not give the Commissioner discretion to refuse a patent on public policy considerations.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at para 40 Additionally, Binnie J. emphasized the fact that Parliament has repealed and avoided including provisions in the Patent Act dealing with the morality of inventions as an indication that these aspects of public policy should be dealt using other regulatory regimes.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 11, 14, 15, 82, 83 and 90 He identified the Assisted Human Reproduction ActAssisted Human Reproduction Act, S.C. 2004, c.2 as an example of specialized legislated enacted to deal with public policy considerations similar to the ones at play in this case.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 93 ==Controversy== Justice Binnie noted that the outcome of this case takes Canada on a very different trajectory than other countries, including the United States, Japan and Europe.Harvard College [2002] 4 SCR 45 at paras 2, 33-38 This fact has led some to argue that there is a risk that biotechnology investment will be reduced in the aftermath of the decision.Garland, Steven B. and Smordin, Sandee, Harvard Mouse Decision and Its Future Implications, The Symposium on the Harvard Mouse Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, 39 Can. Bus. L. J. (2003) at p. 175 The majority's reasoning in drawing the line between higher and lower life forms was called by Dan Burk a \\"rationally indefensible distinction.\\"Burk, Dan L., Reflections in a Darkling Glass: A Comparative Contemplation of the Harvard College Decision Symposium on the Harvard Mouse Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, 39 Can. Bus. L.

This idea is based on the idea that patents are fully constituted property rights, providing patentees with a default level of entitlement and would undoubtedly \\"skew the utilitarian calculus of animal welfare to the advantage of human animals and to the detriment of non-human animals.\\"Adams, W.

President and Fellows of Harvard College, The Symposium on the Harvard Mouse Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, 39 Can. Bus. L. J.

President and Fellows of Harvard College, The Symposium on the Harvard Mouse Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, 39 Can. Bus. L. J.

It contains more than 2,000 lakes. The district had been elected as one of the 28 finalists of the New 7 Wonders of Nature. The Lakeland extends roughly 290 km (180 mi) eastwards from the lower Vistula to the Poland–Russia border, and occupies an area of roughly . Administratively, the Lake District lies within the Warmian- Masurian Voivodeship. Small parts of the district lie within the Masovian and Podlaskie Voivodeships. The lakes are well connected by rivers and canals, forming an extensive system of waterways. The 18th-century Masurian Canal links this system to the Baltic Sea. The whole area is a prime tourist destination, frequented by boating enthusiasts, canoeists, anglers, hikers, bikers and nature-lovers. It is one of the most famous lake districts in Central Europe and a popular vacation spot, with the highest number of visitors every year. ==Geology== The lake district was shaped by glaciers during the Pleistocene ice age. Many of its hills are parts of moraines and many of its lakes are moraine-dammed lakes. ==History== From the 13th century on, the Lakeland was successively part of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia, and the Prussian province of East Prussia. In modern times, while part of the German Empire, it was the location of the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes (1914) and the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes (1915) during World War I. At the end of World War II (1945), following the decision taken at the Potsdam Agreement, all national borders were redrawn, the area annexed by Communist Poland and its German residents expelled. ===Historical population=== Mother tongue of the inhabitants of Masuria, by county, during the first half of the 19th century: {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |+Ethno-linguistic structure of Masurian counties in the first half of the 19th century, according to German data !County (German name) !Year !Polish-speakers !% !German-speakers !% !Lithuanian- speakers !% !Total population |- !Gołdap (Goldap) |1825 |3940 |16% |17412 |70% |3559 |14% |24911 |- !Olecko (Oletzko) |1832 |23302 |84% |4328 |16% |22 |0% |27652 |- !Ełk (Lyck) |1832 |29246 |90% |3413 |10% |4 |0% |32663 |- !Węgorzewo (Angerburg) |1825 |12535 |52% |11756 |48% |60 |0% |24351 |- !Giżycko (Lötzen) |1832 |20434 |89% |2528 |11% |25 |0% |22987 |- !Pisz (Johannisburg) |1825 |28552 |93% |2146 |7% |0 |0% |30698 |- !Mrągowo (Sensburg) |1825 |22391 |86% |3769 |14% |5 |0% |26165 |- !Szczytno (Ortelsburg) |1825 |34928 |92% |3100 |8% |0 |0% |38028 |- !Nidzica (Neidenburg) |1825 |27467 |93% |2149 |7% |1 |0% |29617 |- !Ostróda (Osterode) |1828 |23577 |72% |9268 |28% |0 |0% |32845 |- !TOTAL !1825/32 !226,372 !78% !59,869 !21% !3,676 !1% !289,917 |} ==Tourism== Sundown in Mikołajki The Masurian Lakeland can be reached by train, bus or car.

There are also guesthouses and campsites in surrounding villages. The Masuren Waterway starts in Węgorzewo in the north and finishes in Pisz. This Waterway is new for pleasure boats. Only boats with a low waterdraft can go as far as Pisz on the Pisa. ==Sights and activities== Masuria is famous for its lakes and forests, offering a wide range of outdoor activities from sailing to kayaking and swimming. The region includes the largest lake in Poland, called Śniardwy. The resort towns include the most popular, Giżycko and Mikołajki, Węgorzewo, Ryn, Pisz and Iława. Giżycko is located on the shore of Lake Niegocin. It has an ancient fortress, historic church, bridges, and passenger boats to the towns of Węgorzewo, Mikołajki and Ruciane-Nida.

P. Pandit (14 June 1918 – 14 March 1993) was a spiritual author, teacher and Sanskrit scholar. For several decades, he was a secretary of the Mother (Mirra Alfassa) of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. He wrote numerous books and articles on the yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, on social and political thought, science, philosophy, religion, mysticism, and the classical texts and spiritual traditions of India. == Birth and origin == Madhav P. Pandit was born in Sirsi, a small town in Karnataka. His family belonged to the community of the Gowd Saraswats which had migrated from Kashmir to various parts of India. His father was a wealthy and reputed lawyer who engaged himself in manifold social activities.P. Raja (1993), p. 7–11 == Childhood and education == Pandit grew up in a deeply religious Hindu family. When he was still a small child, his mother started taking him every day in the early morning to a temple where he spent his time in devotion and contemplation, which prepared and influenced his later spiritual path. All his life he was to keep some traditional customs such as Pranām. His father wanted him to become a lawyer, following the family tradition. Therefore, he sent him to the best schools and additionally arranged for private tutoring in English, Sanskrit, mathematics and sciences. After his immatriculation Pandit continued his studies at Karnatak College in Dharwar.P. Raja (1993), p. 12–13; 27 == Spiritual contacts == Sundarrao, one of Pandit's brothers, was in close touch with Ganapati Muni, a well-known disciple of Ramana Maharshi, who was an eminent Sanskrit scholar and poet. Even at young age Pandit came to know him as well as his student Kapali Sastry, who was to become Pandit's tutor over time. Sastry was a great scholar of the Vedas and Tantras and taught Sanskrit at a school in Madras. Later on he became a disciple of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, joining the Sri Aurobindo Ashram where he translated some important texts of Sri Aurobindo into Sanskrit as well as into the South Indian languages Tamil and Telugu. He passed on his manifold knowledge to Pandit, giving him advice and support during his education and on his spiritual path.P. Raja (1993), p. 20–26 == Joining the Sri Aurobindo Ashram == One day, while spending some time in the library of his brother, Pandit by chance discovered an article on Sri Aurobindo and felt spontaneously attracted towards the name and the photo of the freedom fighter and yogi. Subsequently, he started a regular correspondence with Kapali Sastry in Pondicherry and developed increasing interest in spiritual literature. He studied works on Ramakrishna and read the Collected Works of Swami Vivekananda, but eventually turned more and more to Sri Aurobindo and his writings. In April 1937 for the first time he travelled to Pondicherry where Kapali Sastry arranged for his meeting with the Mother, which touched him deeply. However, following the advice of his brother, and encouraged by the Mother, he first went to Bombay in order to complete his academic studies with a bachelor's degree in economics. Thereafter, he was free to move to Pondicherry and became a member of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1939, at the age of 21.P. Raja (1993), pp. 27–42 == Life in the Ashram and lecture tours == Having joined the Ashram, Pandit concentrated intensively on integral yoga and the work given to him. Over time he developed his literary capacities, translating works of Kapali Sastry from Sanskrit and writing a large number of books on philosophy, yoga, the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother or on Mantra, Tantra, Veda and the Upanishads. He always tried to use a clear, simple language in order to reach many readers. In his title Mother and I he later on reported on his frequent personal meetings with the Mother as her secretary and on the numerous topics he discussed with her. In his small books How do I begin and How do I proceed he presented some concrete hints for the practice of integral yoga.P. Raja (1993), pp. 56-60 After the Mother had left her body on 17 November 1973, he continued his activities as before, writing his correspondents that her presence and love persisted. In 1976 he started undertaking foreign travel in order to spread Sri Aurobindo's message abroad. Several times he went to the U.S. and to Europe, gave lectures and interviews or organized seminars and conferences. He regularly informed his readers about his manifold experiences in his Service Letter. However, he declined to be regarded as a \\"Guru\\" and once said in an interview in Florida that this whole ideal was old fashioned now and not any more appropriate. The knowledge that was kept secret formerly, was today freely available, he said, and everyone would be in a position to run his own life and think for himself.P. Raja (1993), p. 62 After a serious illness, Pandit departed on 14 March 1993 in a clinic in Madras. When the next day his body was kept for public's view at his residence, a large number of friends and admirers came to pay homage to him.P. Raja (1993), p. 65P. Raja, Homage == Literature == * P.

Marek was born in Warsaw, as the only son of Maciej Hłasko and Maria Łucja, née Rosiak.Marek Hłasko's parents married on 26 January 1933 At first he lived with his parents in Złotokłos; later they moved to Warsaw. In the Hłasko family, children were baptised relatively late, hence the writer-to-be was baptized on 26 December 1935 in the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Warsaw.Maria Prochowska, his father's sister, and Ryszard Rosiak, his mother's brother, were his godparents It is said that during the baptism ceremony when asked if he renounces the evil spirits Marek answered \\"No\\". Later, these words were reported as the evidence of Marek's strong character. Hłasko was three years old when his parents divorced in 1937. Maciej remarried a year later. He died on 13 September 1939, when his only son was five. The war left its stamp on Marek's psyche: later he wrote \\"it is obvious to me that I am a product of war times, starvation and terror; it is the reason for the intellectual poverty of my short stories. Simply, I cannot think up a story that does not end in death, catastrophe, suicide or imprisonment. Some people accuse me of pretending to be a strong man. They are wrong.\\"Quoted from: A. Czyżewski Piękny dwudziestoletni, p.24 At the outbreak of World War II, Hłasko's mother was working in the management secretariat of the City Power Station in Warsaw. During the occupation she was fired and ran a food stall till the beginning of the Warsaw uprising. As a result, the family's financial situation worsened. At this time Marek started his education; however, all documents that might provide information about his education were destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising. Among the schools that he attended was one near the St. Kazimierz Factory on Tamka Street. During the Warsaw Uprising, Marek stayed with his mother in Warsaw, and when it ended they moved to Częstochowa to the house of a friend. In March 1945, Maria and her son moved to Chorzów and two months later to Białystok, where she settled with Kazimierz Gryczkiewicz. In early 1946, Gryczkiewicz, Maria Hłasko and Marek moved to Wrocław. In the summer of 1946, Marek Hłasko joined the Bolesław Chrobry First Wrocław Scout Troops. In order to become a member of the troop, Marek with his family's consent, gave 1933Also in the year 1950, when he was finishing his van-driving lessons, he gave the year 1933 as his birth date as the year of his birth. Later he was dismissed from the scouts because of the poor attendance at the meetings. Marek worked as a messenger at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, held in August 1948 in Wrocław. The problems connected with Marek's education also cropped up. In his biography of Hłasko, Andrzej Czyżewski writes: \\"(Marek) began his education at the age of six and a half. During his school years he was always one of the youngest pupils in the class. To make matters worse, he had a childish appearance. Hence, he could not show off with what a boy in the primary school wants to impress others: strength, dexterity and maturity. He made up for it with the aggression and pertness, even towards his teachers. As a consequence, he had very few school mates. He was always an outsider. He walked away before he managed to make friends and get accustomed to them.\\".A. Czyżewski Piękny dwudziestoletni, p. 51, In June 1948 he graduated from the Maria Konopnicka Elementary School in Wrocław. From September to November 1948, he studied at the Chamber of Commerce’ of the Secondary School of Business and Administration in Wrocław, and from March until June 1949 in the Labour Association of Children Friends’ School in Legnica (at that time he lived in a dormitory). Later, from December 1949 to January 1950, he attended the Technical and Drama High School in Warsaw, yet, in the end of December 1949 and early January 1950, he was expelled for \\"a notorious disrespect to school regulations, criminal violations, and wielding a corrupting influence on his colleagues\\".quoted from: A. Czyżewski Piękny dwudziestoletni, p. 67 At the age of 16, he obtained his driving licence and started working as a van driver. On 28 September 1950 he was sentenced by the Magistrates' Court to two months of work with a 10% deduction from his salary (as he violated Article 7, point 2 of the Act on Securing Socialist Discipline of Work).A. Czyżewski Piękny dwudziestoletni, p. 72, assumed that being late or missing a working day was an offence After working off his sentence, he changed his employer. From 15 November 1950 to 1 January 1951, he worked in the Transport Depot in Bystrzyca Kłodzka. Experiences gained there later inspired him to write a novel Następny do raju (Next Stop–Paradise). In January 1951 he moved to Warsaw with his mother and step-father. Hłasko often changed his occupation but it was always his own choice. Successively, he worked from 26 February to 15 April 1951 in an Equipment Base of the City's Construction Union, from 27 April 1951 to 16 June 1952 in a subway construction company \\"Metrobudowa\\", from 4 August to 1 December 1952 in a Transport Association of Warsaw Associations of Consumers, and till 30 March 1953 in a Warsaw Transport Enterprise of the City Retail Sale. Writing became a chance to get out of this mind-numbing activity. His literary career started in 1951 when he wrote Baza Sokołowska, his first set of short stories. Hłasko became a correspondent for Trybuna Ludowa (a popular Polish daily) when he was working for \\"Metrobudowa\\". At the end of 1952 he decided to show extracts of his book to Bohdan Czeszko. His reply letter written on 3 December of the same year included a criticism of Hłasko's literary attempts, but also drew attention to the young author's talent. Moreover, also in 1952, Hłasko followed Stefan Łoś's advice and established contact with the Polish Literary Association and Igor Newerly, who was the protector of young writers. Hłasko introduced himself, to both Czeszko and Newerly, as \\"an uneducated driver who tries to describe his life in his free time after work\\".A. Czyżewski Piękny dwudziestoletni, p. 78 In April 1953, he received a three-month artistic scholarship from the Polish Literary Association. He gave up his driver's job for good, and went to Wrocław to work on his debut. Moreover, following Bohdan Czeszko's advice, he wrote a story based on his sketches (a final version of Baza Sokołowska) and finished a novel Sonata marymoncka. He made his debut with Baza Sokołowska in Sztandar Młodych (a daily paper published in Poland in 1950–1997) in 1954. He became quickly known as the most talented writer of the young generation. However, the entering to the literary circle resulted in his alcoholism, which was becoming more and more pronounced. In 1955–1957, he edited a prose section in Po Prostu (a Polish socio-political magazine published in 1947–57), but he was not a good publicist. In 1956 he finally got his own flat in Warsaw. He gained publicity and popularity thanks to his original working style as well as his unconventional behaviour and clothing. He was a legendary figure of the young generation, a symbol of non-conformism. He was well-built; however, the physical appearance concealed over-sensitivity and uncertainty. He was prone to depression and could not adapt to everyday reality. Marek's inclination to rows contrasted with his friends' positive opinions of him. In 1958, he went to Paris. The press there called him an Eastern European James Dean, as Hłasko strikingly resembled him. Hłasko really identified himself with this role: he vandalized pubs and restaurants. At this time, he gained worldwide publicity. Nonetheless, he liked the life of a vagrant, so he left Paris and went to Germany and then to Italy. The publication of Cmentarze [The Graveyard], a novel critical of state socialism, in the émigré Polish-language Parisian monthly Kultura, caused a negative press campaign to be launched against him back in Poland. When his request for renewal of his passport was rejected, Hłasko requested political asylum in Western Germany. After three months, he changed his mind and tried to return to Poland. However, while waiting for a response from the Polish government, he decided to visit Israel in 1959. He could not live without Poland but at the same time he could not return to his homeland. As he did not have a talent for languages, he found it difficult to adjust to the reality of life abroad. He led a life of a vagrant, but he did not have to work while his publications provided him with a steady income. He performed manual labour, but he did so out of curiosity rather than need. Since 1960, he had lived in Germany with his wife, German actress Sonja Ziemann. Marek Hłasko and Krzysztof Komeda In 1963, he spent a month in prison for his feuds with the police. In 1964 he twice attempted suicide. Between 1963 and 1965, he spent a total of 242 days in psychiatric clinics. In 1965, he divorced his wife, and in 1966, with Roman Polanski's help, he went to Los Angeles. He was supposed to write screenplays, but it did not work out. He had an affair with Betty, the wife of Nicholas Ray, the author of Rebel Without a Cause, and thereby ended his career as a screenwriter. He got a pilot's licence instead. In December 1968, during one of his parties, he playfully pushed Krzysztof Komeda off an escarpment. As a result of this accident, Komeda got a brain hematoma and died four months later. Hłasko was to say: \\"If Krzysztof dies, I'll go along\\" (Jeśli Krzysio umrze, to i ja pójdę). In 1969, he came back to Germany. He died in Wiesbaden at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death remain unknown. One hypothesis is that he mixed alcohol with sedative drugs. However, those who knew him maintain that suicide was out of the question in his case. In 1975, his ashes were taken to Poland, and buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. Jan Himilsbach, a writer, actor and stonecutter who worked at the cemetery, was one of the initiators for taking Hłasko's remains back to Poland. Himilsbach carved the inscriptions on Hłasko's grave. The notice was suggested by Hłasko's mother and it says: \\"His life was short, and everybody turned their backs on him\\". == Artistic work == Marek's private life resembled the life of characters of his works – romantic, tough outsiders, who became symbols of disappointment with realities of the 1950s. Humphrey Bogart and Fyodor Dostoevsky were his idols. His prose works voiced his objections to conformity and the hypocrisy of socialist realist literature. He wrote about protest of a moral nature. In his works he depicted the lives of the lower classes as dominated by hopelessness and cynicism. His characters dream about changes which come out to be vain. Publishing of his works had been forbidden in Poland for 20 years. He was a co-screenwriter of films such as Koniec nocy (1957), Pętla (1957), Spotkania (1957), Ósmy dzień tygodnia (1958) and Baza ludzi umarłych. === Novels === *Ósmy dzień tygodnia (The Eighth Day of the Week, 1957) *Następny do raju (Next to Heaven/Next Stop–Paradise, 1958 - translation into English by Norbet Guterman published by Heinemann, 1959) *Cmentarze (The Graveyard, 1958 - translation into English by Norbet Guterman published by Heinemann, 1959) *Wszyscy byli odwróceni (All Backs Were Turned, 1964) *Brudne czyny (Dirty Deeds, 1964) *Drugie zabicie psa (Killing the Second Dog, 1965; translation into English by Tomasz Mirkowicz published by New Vessel Press, 2014) *Nawrócony w Jaffie (Converted in Jaffa, 1966) *Sowa córka piekarza (Owl, the Baker's Daughter, 1967) *Sonata marymoncka (published posthumously 1982) *Palcie ryż każdego dnia (Chew Your Nails Every Day, published posthumously 1985) === Short stories === *Wilk (novel fragment) (1954) *Szkoła (novel fragment) (1954) *Złota jesień (novel fragment) (1954) *Noc nad piękną rzeką (novel fragment) (1954) *Głód (novel fragment) (1956) *Pierwszy krok w chmurach (1956) – a collection of short stories **Dom mojej matki **Robotnicy **Okno **List **Finis perfectus **Dwaj mężczyźni na drodze **Baza Sokołowska **Żołnierz **Kancik, czyli wszystko się zmieniło **Pijany o dwunastej w południe **Odlatujemy w niebo **Pierwszy krok w chmurach, Śliczna dziewczyna **Najświętsze słowa naszego życia **Lombard złudzeń **Pętla (short story) *Stacja (1962) *Opowiadania (1963)In this volume there was also Ósmy dzień tygodnia. **Amor nie przyszedł dziś wieczorem **Namiętności **Port pragnień **Zbieg **Krzyż **Miesiąc Matki Boskiej **Szukając gwiazd **Powiedz im, kim byłem **W dzień śmierci Jego *Umarli są wśród nas (published posthumously, 1986) *Pamiętasz, Wanda?

The line is along the tracks of the former Fitchburg Railroad, which was built across northern Massachusetts, United States, in the 1840s. It is one of the MBTA's more scenic commuter rail lines, passing by Walden Pond between Lincoln and Concord. Weekend service includes a specially equipped seasonal \\"ski train\\" to Wachusett Mountain during the winter. At long, the Fitchburg Line is the second-longest line in the system (and was the longest until the Providence/Stoughton Line's 2010 extension to T. F. Green Airport and later to Wickford Junction), and ranks as one of the worst lines in terms of on-time performance. The Fitchburg Line has the oldest infrastructure in the system, and commuter trains must share trackage with freight trains on the outer segment of the line. Only ten of the line's nineteen stations, including both terminals, are fully handicapped accessible - the lowest proportion of any MBTA Commuter Rail line. A $150 million project completed in 2017 included adding nine miles of double track, an extension to Wachusett, rebuilding two stations, and building a new layover yard. ==History== Geographic map of the Fitchburg Railroad A branch line train at South Acton station in 1911 Former platform at Gardner, the terminus of the line from 1980 to 1987 ===Boston & Maine=== The Fitchburg Railroad opened between 1840 and 1845 from Boston to Fitchburg. In 1854, Henry David Thoreau wrote about his skepticism of the Fitchburg Railroad near Walden Pond in his book Walden.https://www.wired.com/2010/08/0809thoreau-walden-published/ The Boston and Maine Railroad leased the Fitchburg Railroad in 1900 and bought it finally in 1919. In 1948, The Master Highway Plan for the Boston Metropolitan Area proposed the construction of eight radial expressways around Boston connecting to the Inner Belt, Interstate 695. A section of the Northwest Expressway, carrying a concurrency of Route 2 and Route 3, was to run along the Fitchburg right-of-way from Union Square in Somerville to Sherman Street in North Cambridge. This expressway would have taken up some or all of the trackbed, which was then four tracks wide in that section. After successful highway revolts, Governor Francis W. Sargent placed a hold on all highway construction inside Route 128 in 1970. Following a study, Sargent permanently canceled the 1948 plans in 1972, thus also securing the corridor's future for railroad use. In January 1958, passenger service on the Fitchburg Division was cut back from the B&M;'s western terminal in Troy, New York to Williamstown; branch line service to Bellows Falls, Vermont, (with connections for Montreal) and Maynard was discontinued that May, while Main Line service was further truncated to Greenfield in December. All service west of Fitchburg was dropped on 23 April 1960. ===MBTA era=== When the newly formed MBTA began subsidizing the Boston & Maine Railroad's intrastate service on January 18, 1965, service was only kept to communities in the MBTA's limited funding district. All service on the Fitchburg Line west of West Concord was cut, as was the low-ridership stop at Riverview; several other northside lines were cut or run at reduced service levels as well. The MBTA scrambled to find funding; subsidy agreements were soon reached with towns along the lines. Service was restored as far as Ayer on June 28, 1965, along with the outer Rockport Branch and full schedules on the Lowell and Ipswich routes. Although some gains were made, including the reopening of Belmont Center and Waverley stations on March 4, 1974, the system continued to hang on by thin margins. The Central Mass Branch, which shared trackage with the Fitchburg, was cut on November 26, 1971. In December 1973, state subsidies for towns outside the MBTA funding district were halved, resulting in the MBTA needing to renegotiate subsidies from 14 municipalities. Ultimately Ayer, with just 14 daily commuters, refused to pay its $8200 bill in 1974; Littleton also refused $12,300 for its 21 riders. On March 1, 1975, the line was cut back to South Acton, dropping stops at Ayer, Littleton, and West Acton. Two lightly used stops in Waltham – Clematis Brook and Beaver Brook – closed in June 1978. On December 27, 1976, the MBTA bought the Boston and Maine Railroad's northside commuter rail assets, including the entire length of the Fitchburg Line. The closure of the Lexington Branch the next month represented the limit of the contraction of the northside lines; as a result of the 1970s energy crisis and especially the 1979 energy crisis, a period of rapid expansion began in the end of the 1970s. Service was restored to Fitchburg and beyond to Gardner on January 13, 1980. Gardner service was ended on January 1, 1987 when Amtrak took over the MBTA contract, due to a dispute between Amtrak and Guilford; the MBTA only owned the trackage to Fitchburg. In December 2006, the MBTA began branding certain winter weekend round trips as \\"ski trains\\". The train used includes a car equipped with ski racks; a shuttle bus to Wachusett Mountain connects at Wachusett station. (Until the 2016-2017 ski season, the bus ran to Fitchburg station instead.) ===Improvement project=== Due to the cyclic expansion and contraction for the first three decades of the MBTA's existence, the Fitchburg Line was largely neglected and its infrastructure began to decline. The Fitchburg route was once fully double tracked from Boston to Troy, New York; however, the second main was removed in many sections as passenger service declined. By 2000, there was a section of single track between South Acton and Ayer, and a shorter section in Waltham. This limited the number of trains which could continue past South Acton to Fitchburg. Until the extension of the Providence leg of the Providence/Stoughton Line to T.F. Green Airport in 2010, the Fitchburg Line was the longest line on the MBTA system; it is now the second longest, and still the longest without full double track. ====Studies==== In 2000, the Massachusetts State Legislature passed a bill that directed the MBTA to \\"conduct a feasibility study regarding the reestablishment of the commuter rail line to the cities of Gardner and Athol on the existing Fitchburg/Gardner/Athol spur line\\" as one of many expansion and improvement projects. In 2001, the MBTA began taking public comment for the decadal update to its Program for Mass Transportation. Following response from legislators from communities along the line, the MBTA initiated a study of potential improvements to the line, including not only westward extension but also station improvements and travel time reductions. Before the improvement project, Littleton/Route 495 station had a non-accessible low platform served by a single track. The 2004 edition of the Program for Mass Transportation found that restoration of service all the way to Gardner, much less Athol, was deemed impractical for several reasons. Gardner is and Athol by rail from North Station – outside normal commuting distances. The line between Fitchburg and Gardner would cost $104.2 million to double track, and speeds are limited due to the grades going through the Wachusett Mountain range. Because the Route 2 expressway is faster along the corridor than rail service would be, the station at Gardner would have attracted just 50 riders per day. Instead, a 4-mile extension to a previously considered station in West Fitchburg was recommended. The Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line Service Expansion Study was released in February 2005, drawing off the PMT conclusions. Recommended short- range improvements included station consolidation, track upgrades, and station improvements; longer-term projects included double-tracking, increased service frequency, and an extension to Wachusett or Gardner. The report priced out $55 million in infrastructure upgrades including double tracking through downtown Waltham and from South Acton to Willows, signal improvements, rebuilding Littleton/Route 495 station, and grade crossing modifications. An extension to Wachusett was to cost $39 million, with Gardner costing an additional $50 million. As an immediate change, the MBTA began running express trains on the line. The Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line Improvement Implementation Plan, released in September 2005, included a longer list of possible improvements, and outlined a goal of reducing travel time between Porter Square and Fitchburg to one hour. The $300 million list included high-level platforms at all stops from Porter to Littleton, grade crossing eliminations, a flyover at Willows, and stop consolidations. The three Weston stops were to be combined, Ayer and Shirley combined into a Devens station, and Waverley and Belmont stations combined. Few of these expanded alternatives were ultimately pursued. The MBTA applied for a federal Small Starts grant in September 2005, and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority filed a scoping package in April 2007 that began the analysis of construction alternatives. The Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line Improvements Project Alternatives Analysis was released in September 2007 and outlined six options: no build with the addition of some continuously welded rail to the line, a $30 million baseline with a new layover facility, and three build options ranging from $150 million to $239 million. Build Alternative 1, costing $150 million, was chosen. ====Funding and construction==== Double tracking and a rebuilt crossing at Boxborough in November 2012 In November 2007, following the completion of five years of conceptual studies, the MBTA announced $150 million in projects to significantly upgrade the Fitchburg Line. The project focuses on reducing travel times, increasing service frequency, and improving on-time performance. With the addition of several smaller funding sources, the improvements ultimately became a $306 million project with five major components: =====CPF-43 interlocking===== The first work completed was the addition of CPF-43, a new interlocking located at Derby Curve in Leominster. Financed by $10.2 million in ARRA funds, the work was intended to \\"provide commuter rail operational flexibility and to minimize conflicts with freight\\". CPF-43 includes a universal crossover between the two mainline tracks, plus a new connection to a siding with of space for maintenance-of-way equipment storage and 1000 feet to connect to existing freight customers. Construction work began in October 2009 and finished by the end of 2011. =====North Leominster garage===== The completed garage in December 2014 Located just off Route 2, the North Leominster station was often crowded for commuter parking spaces. After 5 years of planning, construction began in March 2012 on a three-story garage which provides 340 parking spaces. The $7.7 million project, which was funded by the FTA through earmarks and formula funding, includes a covered busway and charging stations for electric cars. Originally to be completed in August 2013, the garage was delayed due to high summer heat which prevented pouring concrete as well as contractor's financial problems. The garage opened on May 20, 2014. Construction of full-length high-level accessible platforms was considered as part of the project, but the platforms would have cost an additional $18 million and created clearance issues with passing Pan Am freight trains. The freight trains, which are slightly wider than standard passenger cars, frequently impact the mini-high platforms and would cause severe damage to full-length platforms. =====Double tracking===== Littleton station shortly after it was rebuilt $43 million ($40 million in ARRA funds and $3 million from the state Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development) provided for the restoration of of double track from Central Street in West Acton to Willows Junction in Ayer. This leaves a short section in Waltham as the only single-track section of the line. Like many of the outer stations on the line, Littleton/Route 495 was built in 1980 with a bare low-level concrete platform (not accessible for handicapped riders) serving a single track. Beginning in early 2012, it was rebuilt with a full-length island platform serving the original track and a new second track. The new station opened in June 2013. In August 2014, with the double tracking nearly complete, all South Acton short turns were extended to Littleton. The double tracking work, including 8 grade crossing replacements and a new interlocking just east of Littleton station, was completed in November 2014. =====Small Starts funding===== South Acton station near completion in November 2015 The largest piece of the project, funded by a total of $172 million in state money and Federal Transit Administration \\"Small Starts\\" funding, involved incremental improvements to existing infrastructure. Work started in 2012 and was largely completed by the end of 2015. South Acton station is the busiest station on the line, with 902 daily riders by a 2013 count. Like Littleton, it formerly had a single low-level platform. After significant design changes based on community input, construction started on a new station with two full- length high-level side platforms in September 2012. The new station opened on December 21, 2015, with some minor work lasting into June 2016. An additional of double track was installed through the station, filling the gap between the separately funded double tracking to the west and previously existing double track to the east. Previously, the section of the line east of Acton had an older signalling system which permitted operations in one direction on each track, which prevented express trains from passing locals and limited schedule density. Fiber optic cable was installed over this segment and new signals installed to permit full bidirectional operation. The double-tracked section west of Willows, which already had bidirectional signalling to permit passenger and slower freight trains to mix, received incremental upgrades. The new signals, along with concurrent track work, allowed maximum speeds on the line to increase from to , with a faster schedule implemented on May 23, 2016. Seven bridges were replaced or significantly repaired, including one over Route 62 in Concord which was a late addition to the project. Thirteen grade crossings were replaced, nine interlockings built new or improved, and dispatching of some segments transferred from the outdated tower at Waltham to the MBTA's control center. A new freight crossover was added at Ayer, with the East Main Street bridge undercut to increase clearances. =====Wachusett extension===== First revenue train at Wachusett station in September 2016 Per the recommendations of the mid-2000s studies, the line was extended west of Fitchburg to a new Wachusett park-and-ride station. The work was funded by a $55 million federal TIGER grant awarded in 2010, plus $19 million in state money. Construction started in mid-2013, and the station opened for limited service on September 30, 2016 to satisfy the terms of the federal grant. Funded by the same grant was a new layover yard in Westminster, just west of the new station, which replaced a smaller yard in East Fitchburg. The town of Westminster opposed the project due to noise pollution issues, and filed complaints about the MBTA alleging that proper permits had not been obtained and that the agency had misled the town about construction delays. Construction was eventually allowed to proceed; the layover yard opened on November 21, 2016, along with full service to Wachusett station. =====Weekend service curtailments===== Work like laying track, connecting switches, and testing new signals was difficult or impossible to perform during regular daily service. In order to accommodate this work, during 2013 through 2015 service was curtailed on weekends when ridership is significantly lower. Full service was operated during winter months, when snowy weather may make driving a less palatable alternative. In 2013, weekend service was cut back to South Acton from June through August and to Brandeis/Roberts from September to November. In 2014, it was cut back to Brandeis/Roberts from late April to July, and discontinued entirely until November. In 2015, weekend service was discontinued from April 25 to November 22 except on holiday weekends. ==Trackage== The MBTA owns all track between Boston and Fitchburg. The line west of the old Stony Brook Railroad (which joins at Willows, east of Ayer) is used by Pan Am Railways as part of their main line between Mattawamkeag, Maine and Mechanicville, New York. Pan Am owns trackage west of Fitchburg, including the section used for the Wachusett extension. Pan Am runs both through freights and Fitchburg-based locals west of Willows; there is no regular freight service on the line east of Willows. The Walden Street Cattle Pass crosses beneath the Walden Street bridge in Cambridge, adjacent to the tracks; it was last used in the 1920s.\\"Cambridge Cattle Market\\", in Cambridge Historical Commission-North Cambridge Stabilization Committee report, 2002 The Union Square Branch of the under-construction Green Line Extension will share the right-of-way of the Fitchburg Line from the Inner Belt area to Union Square station. Reconstruction of the Medford Street bridge began in March 2013 as part of initial work; the station is expected to open in 2021. ==Station listing== A train at North Station, the inbound terminus of the line Waverley station The tiny station building at Shirley {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Fare zone !Location !Mile (km) !Station !Connections and notes |- | rowspan=\\"3\\" |1A |Boston |0.0 (0.0) |width=\\"130\\" bgcolor=ffdfff| | Amtrak: MBTA Commuter Rail: Lowell Line, Haverhill Line, and Newburyport/Rockport Line MBTA subway: Orange Line, Green Line (C branch and E branch) MBTA bus: |- |Somerville |0.7 (1.1) |Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility |Flag stop for MBTA employees only |- |Cambridge |3.4 (5.5) |bgcolor=ffdfff| | MBTA subway: Red Line MBTA bus: |- | rowspan=\\"3\\" |1 | rowspan=\\"2\\" |Belmont |6.4 (10.3) |bgcolor=ffdfff| | MBTA bus: |- |7.4 (11.9) |bgcolor=ffdfff| | MBTA bus: |- | rowspan=\\"5\\" |Waltham |8.3 (13.4) | |Closed in June 1978.

Such mutations can cause a complete lack of production of the associated gene product or a product that does not function properly; in either case, the allele may be considered nonfunctional. A null allele cannot be distinguished from deletion of the entire locus solely from phenotypic observation. A mutant allele that produces no RNA transcript is called an RNA null (shown by Northern blotting or by DNA sequencing of a deletion allele), and one that produces no protein is called a protein null (shown by Western blotting). A genetic null or amorphic allele has the same phenotype when homozygous as when heterozygous with a deficiency that disrupts the locus in question. A genetic null allele may be both a protein null and an RNA null, but may also express normal levels of a gene product that is nonfunctional due to mutation. Null alleles can have lethal effects depending on the importance of the mutated gene. For example, mice homozygous for a null allele for insulin die 48 to 72 hours after birth. == Evidence  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) === A microsatellite null allele is an allele at a microsatellite locus that does not amplify to detectable levels in a polymerase chain reaction test. Microsatellite regions are usually characterized by short, repeated sequences of nucleotides. Primers that are specific to a particular locus are used in PCR amplification to bind to these nucleotide sequence repeats and are used as genetic markers. The primers anneal to either end of the locus and are derived from source organisms in a genomic library. Divergence from the reference sequences (from genetic mutations) results in poor annealing of the primers so that the marker cannot be used, representative of a null allele. === Parentage analysis === Strong evidence of null alleles was first seen in analysis of bears in 1995. In this analysis, a known parent was determined to be homozygous at a certain locus, but produced offspring that expressed a different \\"homozygous\\" genotype. This result led to the inference that the parent and offspring were both heterozygous for the locus being studied. == Examples == Null alleles or genes have been studied in different organisms from the red pines of Minnesota to Drosophila melanogaster and mice. Null alleles are difficult to identify because a heterozygous individual for one null allele and one active allele is phenotypically indistinguishable from a homozygous individual with both active alleles. In other words, a null allele can only be identified from the phenotypic standpoint if the individual is homozygous for the null allele. Researchers have been able to work around this problem by using detailed Electrophoresis, gel assays, and chromosomal manipulation. # Allendorf et al. studied the enzyme activity of the same species of red pine seeds collected from two different tree stands in Minnesota. The two groups of trees were treated as one population because no deviations from expected genotype frequencies were observed, as would be expected if the populations were diverging from one another. Many different loci were tested for enzyme activity using a specific gel electrophoresis technique. Alleles that produced an enzyme lacking catalytic activity were denoted as null alleles. A total of 27 loci were tested in red pines and null alleles were found at 3 of those loci. # A population of Drosophila melanogaster from Raleigh, NC were genetically manipulated by Voelker et al. in 1980 to determine existence and frequency of null alleles. The experiment consisted of making the chromosome of a wild fly heterozygous by using the mobility variants at the locus being observed. If the manipulated allele (now heterozygous) did not present a heterozygous phenotype, the allele was suspected to be null. These potential null alleles were then confirmed when they failed to produce a heterozygous electrophoretic pattern. A total of 25 loci were tested with 5 loci being X-linked and the remaining 20 autosomal. No null alleles were detected at the X-linked loci, but 13 of the 20 autosomal loci contained null alleles. # Multiple different experiments have used genetic manipulation to induce null allele mutants in mice populations in order to observe the consequences of different allele combinations at specific loci. Two such experiments investigated the role of insulin-like growth factor (Igf) in mouse embryonic development. The experiments only differed in the gene being investigated, Igf-1 and Igf-2. Both experiments used the process of mutageneis, whereby the genetic content of the organism is changed, to produce individuals with different combinations of null mutations. By observing the consequences of different inactive allele combinations, the researchers were able to deduce the roles of insulin-like growth factors in the development of mice. The experiment involving Igf-1 revealed that, in addition to its role after birth, it is also fundamental in the development of the embryo and the differentiation of cells. # One example of a null allele is the 'O' blood type allele in the human A, B and O blood type system. The alleles for the A-antigen and B-antigen are co-dominant, thus they are both phenotypically expressed if both are present. The allele for O blood type, however, is a mutated version of the allele for the A-antigen, with a single base pair change due to genetic mutation. The protein coded for by the O allele is enzymatically inactive and therefore the O allele is expressed phenotypically in homozygous OO individuals as the lack of any blood antigen. Thus we may consider the allele for the O blood type as a null allele. ==See also== *Pseudogene *Muller's morphs *Genetic deletion *RecLOH *Unique-event polymorphism ==References== Category:Classical genetics ","title":"Null allele"},{"id":"2000283","text":"Live (X Cert) is a live album by The Stranglers released in 1979.

At , it covers more than half of Niger's land area, ans is the largest region in the country, as well as the largest African state subdivision. The capital of the department is Agadez. ==History== The region is a centre for palaeontology, with numerous dinosaur skeletons being found here, including the Ouranosaurus nigeriensis. Cave painting and the remains of ancient human settlements are also located here. Tuareg peoples began migrating to the region from the mid-8th century. From the mid-15th century to the early 20th, much of the region was under the control of the Sultanate of Agadez, except for a period when the area came under the rule of the Songhai Empire in the 1500s. The region suffered with the advent of French colonialism as power shifted away to the southwest; Tuareg disaffection with French rule resulted in the Kaocen revolt in 1916-17. This process continued following Niger's independence in 1960; local Tuareg saw little recompense from the uranium mining boom in Arlit in the 1970s, and Agadez Region was struck by repeated draughts and famines. Since then there have been two Tuareg rebellions: from 1990-95 and 2007-09. In recent years the region has also been affected by the actions of Islamist groups. ==Geography== Agadez Region borders Algeria (Tamanrasset Province and Illizi Province) and Libya (Murzuq District) to the north, Chad to the east, Diffa Region, Zinder Region, Tahoua Region and Maradi Region to the south, and Mali (Kidal Region) to the west. It is by far the largest region of the country, representing 52% of the total area of Niger. The region is dominated by the Sahara desert, and includes the vast Ténéré portion of that desert, as well as dune seas such as the Erg of Bilma.Geels, Jolijn, (2006) Bradt Travel Guide - Niger, pgs. 157-200 The Aïr Mountains, the tallest peaks in Niger, are also located here. The Djado Plateau is located in the far north. ===Settlements=== Agadez is the regional capital; other major settlements include Aderbissinat, Arlit, Assamakka, Bilma, Dirkou, Iferouane, In-Gall, Madama, Séguedine, Tchirozerine, Tegguiada In Tessoum and Timia. ===Administrative subdivisions=== Agadez is divided into three Departments and one Commune. {| class=wikitable |+ Administrative Subdivisions !

Its 487,620 inhabitants (as per the 2012 census)Niger at Geohive account for only 2.8% of the total population of Niger, with a population density of . Much of its population comprises nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples, including Arabs, Fulani, Kanuri, Dazaga Toubou and various Tuareg groups. The Tagdal language and Tasawaq language, thought to be mixed Songhai-Tuareg languages, are also spoken. ==Economy== The Aïr Mountains near Timia Traversed for centuries by the Trans Saharan trade routes, the oasis towns of the Aïr and the eastern Kaouar Cliffs are known for their gardens, salt manufacture, and date cultivation. Arlit is the centre of Niger's uranium industry, a prominent economic sector in the region with uranium pits and mines operated by foreign companies providing substantial revenue for the country. The French discovered Niger's first uranium deposits in the Tim Mersoi Basin of the Agadez Region in 1958 and since then French companies such as Areva have maintained a large footprint in the region, employing a large quantity of locals. Depressed uranium prices since the 1980s have hit the region hard, though uranium remains one of the main foreign exchange earners for the country. Agadez had historically been one of the main centres of tourism in Niger, with visitors attracted by the desert scenery, archaeological sites and the Air Mountains. However Tuareg rebellions and activities of Islamist militants in Agadez region have severely reduced the numbers of tourists, with most third party governments advising against travel to the region. == See also == * Communes of Niger * Departments of Niger * Regions of Niger == References  External links == * Category:Regions of Niger Category:Tuareg ","title":"Agadez Region"},{"id":"2000289","text":"Antoni Cieszyński Antoni Cieszyński (31 May 1882 in Oels (Oleśnica), Silesia, Germany – 4 July 1941 in Lwów, Poland) was a Polish physician, dentist and surgeon.

It covers 156 906 km², and it borders Agadez Region to the north, Chad to the east, Nigeria to the south, and Zinder Region to the west. The landscape is primarily Sahelian in the south, merging into the Sahara desert in the north of the region. In the far southeast can be found Niger's portion of Lake Chad; formerly extending as far west as N'guigmi, the lake has shrunk drastically in recent decades.Geels, Jolijn, (2006) Bradt Travel Guide - Niger, pgs. 227-38 In the southeast the Komadougou Yobe river forms part of the border with Nigeria. ===Settlements=== Diffa is the regional capital; other major settlements include Bosso, Chetimari, Dungass, Gueskerou, Goudoumaria, Kablewa, Mainé-Soroa, N'Gourti, N'Guelbély, N'guigmi and Toumour. === Administrative subdivisions === Departments of Diffa Diffa Region is divided into three Departments: * Diffa Department * Maïne-Soroa Department * N'guigmi Department The Region also includes three Urban Communes, a number of Rural Communes, four Cantons, and over twenty Groupments (administrative councils of nomadic communities).

The age range is 37% aged less than 20, 57% between 20 – 60, and 6% older than 60 years old. The total annual growth rate is around 1.2% and it is one of the least populated areas of Niger ( 2.2 people/km²). The main ethnolinguistic groups in the region are the Diffa Arabs, Fula, Hausa, Kanuri, Dazaga and Tedaga Toubou and Tuaregs.Présentation de la région de Diffa: des potentialités naturelles considérables. Abdou Saïdou, Le Sahel (Niamey). 17 December 2009 === Refugees === Refugees from Nigeria fleeing violence from Boko Haram are living with local populations in the Diffa Region. As of 11 June 11 2014, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) estimated that as many as 1,000 refugees a week were crossing the border into Diffa region; four out of five are women and girls. By October 2015 the number of Nigerian refugees in the region had risen to at least 150,000.

(2006) The economy of Diffa Region is primarily agricultural, based upon pastoralism and farming. The major crop, grown both for subsistence and sale, is millet, especially drought-tolerant varieties. One third of arable land is devoted to farming: almost 105,000 hectares farmed of the 299,500 hectares of arable land. Areas of the east and south also grow rice and maize. Irrigation in the valleys around Maïné-Soroa make this possible, as does the edge of Lake Chad (3,000 km² in the far east) and the seasonal Komadougou Yobe river valley in the south, which forms around 150 km of the border with Nigeria. Despite this the Diffa Region is among the most unproductive agricultural areas in Niger, and all of West Africa, making it especially vulnerable to drought and famine. == See also == * Regions of Niger * Departments of Niger * Communes of Niger * 2010 Sahel famine == References == * Portions of this article were translated from the French language Wikipedia article :fr:Diffa (région), 2008-06-19. * * *The Wodaabe Of Southeastern Niger.

She was part of a coup d'etat that placed Catherine on the throne. Vorontsova- Dashkova was the first woman in the world to head a national academy of sciences and helped found the Russian Academy. She also published prolifically, with original and translated works on many subjects. ==Early life== Coat of arms of the Vorontsov family Born Countess Yekaterina Vorontsova, she was the third daughter of Count Roman Vorontsov, a member of the Senate, and was distinguished for her intellectual gifts. Her uncle Mikhail Illarionovich and brother Alexander Romanovich both served as Imperial Chancellors, while her brother Semyon was Russian ambassador to Great Britain, and a celebrated Anglophile. She received an exceptionally good education, having displayed from a very early age the abilities and tastes which made her whole career so singular. She was well versed in mathematics, which she studied at the University of Moscow. In general literature, her favorite authors were Bayle, Montesquieu, Boileau, Voltaire and Helvétius. ==Catherine's coup d'état== Mikhail Ivanovich Dashkov While still a girl, she was connected with the Russian court, and became one of the leaders of the party that attached itself to the Grand Duchess Catherine Alexeyevna. Before she was sixteen, she married Prince Mikhail Ivanovich Dashkov (1736–1764), a prominent Russian nobleman of Rurikid stock, in February 1759, and went to reside with him in Moscow. She learned Russian there to communicate with her in-laws. After the death of Prince Dashkov, she gave herself up to her children, to literature, and to politics. This source reports that Prince Dashkov died in 1761. In 1762, she was at Saint Petersburg and took, according to her own account, the leading part in the coup d'état by which Catherine was raised to the throne; however, this was discounted by Catherine in her letters. Another course of events would probably have resulted in the elevation of the Princess Dashkova's elder sister, Elizabeth, who was the former emperor's mistress, and in whose favor he made no secret of his intention to divorce with Catherine and to make Elizabeth Vorontsova his wife and empress consort. ==Foreign travels== Her relations with the new empress were not of cordial nature, though she continued to be devotedly loyal. She often disliked the men Catherine the Great chose to take as lovers, and often resented the graces and devotion shown to them by the Empress. Her blunt manners, her unconcealed scorn of the male favorites that in her eye disgraced the court, and perhaps also her sense of unrequited merit, produced an estrangement between her and the empress, which ended in her asking permission to travel abroad. Permission was granted, and shortly thereafter she departed, but remained a loyal supporter of Catherine, and the two women remained friends. The true cause of her request to leave was said to have been the refusal by Catherine the Great of her request to be appointed colonel of the imperial guards similar to Catherine herself. Her husband having meanwhile died, she set out in 1768 on an extended tour through Europe. She was received with great consideration at foreign courts, and her literary and scientific reputation procured her the entrée to the society of the learned in most of the capitals of Europe. In Paris, she secured the warm friendship and admiration of Diderot and Voltaire. She showed in various ways a strong liking for Britain and the British. She corresponded with Garrick, Dr. Blair, and Principal Robertson; and when in Edinburgh, where she was very well received, she arranged to entrust the education of her son, Pavel Michailovich, Prince Dashkov to Principal Robertson. She lived in Edinburgh from 1777 to 1779, and donated a collection of Russian commemorative medals to the University of Edinburgh and was wounded in a sword duel with a Scottish lady. Her son became an adjutant of Grigory Potyomkin. Having been healthy from a duel wound she travelled to Ireland to visit her friend Catherine HamiltonThe Memoirs of Princess Dashkova|Duke University Press |date=2003 |page=149, daughter of John Ryder, the Archbishop of Tuam, where she can be seen watching a review of the Irish Volunteers in a picture by Francis Wheatley in November 1779. She was friends with Georgiana Shipley, daughter of Jonathan Shipley, in London. She met Benjamin Franklin in Paris on 3 February 1781. ==Head of Two Academies== In 1782, Dashkova returned to the Russian capital, and was at once taken into favor by the empress, who strongly sympathized with her in her literary tastes, and especially in her desire to elevate Russian to a high place among the literary languages of Europe. Immediately after her return, the princess was appointed Director of the Imperial Academy of Arts and Sciences (known now as the Russian Academy of Sciences). Theoretically the head of the Academy was always its President; however, Count Kirill Razumovsky, who had been appointed President in 1746 (when he was just 18) played only a nominal role in the Academy, and the actual leadership in the Academy, such as there was, belonged to successive Directors. Dashkova was the first woman in the world to head a national academy of sciences. Although not a scientist herself, Dashkova restored the failing institution to prominence and intellectual respectability. This came at a critical time in the history of science, its transformation from what was called natural philosophy, often practiced by gifted amateurs, to a professional enterprise. In 1784 Dashkova was also named the first president of the newly created Russian Academy. In this position, too, she acquitted herself with marked ability. She launched the Russian Academy's project for the creation of its 6-volume Dictionary of the Russian Languages, arranged its plan, and executed a part of the work herself. In 1783 she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the first woman among this academy's foreign members, and its second female member after Eva Ekeblad. Shortly before Catherine's death, the friends quarrelled over a tragedy which the princess had allowed to find a place in the publications of the Academy, though it contained revolutionary principles, according to the empress. A partial reconciliation was effected, but the princess soon afterwards retired from court. ==Exile and legacy== Dashkova's villa in Kiryanovo near St. Petersburg On the accession of the Emperor Paul in 1796, she was deprived of all her offices, and ordered to retire to a miserable village in the government of Novgorod, \\"to meditate on the events of 1762.\\" After a time the sentence was partially recalled on the petition of her friends, and she was permitted to pass the closing years of her life on her own estate near Moscow, where she died on 4 January 1810. Her son, the last of the Dashkov family, died in 1807 and bequeathed his fortune to his cousin Ivan Vorontsov, who thereupon by imperial licence assumed the name Vorontsov- Dashkov. Ivan's son, Count Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov, held an appointment in the tsar's household from 1881 to 1897 before gaining wide renown as a General-Governor of Caucasus from 1905 to 1915. ==Works== Besides her work on the Russian dictionary, Princess Dashkova edited a monthly magazine, and wrote at least two dramatic works: The Marriage of Fabian, and a comedy entitled Toissiokoff. Her memoirs were published in French in Paris in 1804 (Mon Histoire) and in English in 1840 in London in two volumes (Memoirs of the Princess Daschkaw, written by herself). The English version of her memoirs was edited by Mrs. W. Bradford. (This is Martha Wilmot, who lived with the princess from 1803-1808; her family missing her, elder sister Katherine Wilmot went to bring her home, but the pair decided to stay another couple of years.) ===Exhibitions=== \\"The Princess and the Patriot: Ekaterina Dashkova, Benjamin Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment\\" exhibition was held in Philadelphia, U.S.A., from February to December 2006. Benjamin Franklin and Dashkova met only once, in Paris in 1781. Franklin was 75 and Dashkova was 37. Franklin and Dashkova were both evidently impressed with each other. Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society, and the only one to be so honored for another 80 years. Later, Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the Russian Academy. The correspondence between Franklin and Dashkova was the highlight of the exhibition. ==See also== * Maria Choglokova * Praskovya Bruce ==NotesReferencesSources== *The princess & the patriot: Ekaterina Dashkova, Benjamin Franklin , and the Age of Enlightenment, Volume 96, Part 1, Editor Sue Ann Prince, American Philosophical Society, 2006, * Woronzoff-Dashkoff, A.

It was the first commercial magazine to be devoted entirely to the subject. Launched in January 2004 as a quarterly publication, Retro Gamer soon became a monthly. In 2005, a general decline in gaming and computer magazine readership led to the closure of its publishers, Live Publishing, and the rights to the magazine were later purchased by Imagine Publishing. It was taken over by Future plc on 21 October 2016, following Future's acquisition of Imagine Publishing. ==History== The first 18 issues of the magazine came with a coverdisk. It usually contained freeware remakes of retro video games and emulators, but also videos and free commercial PC software such as The Games Factory and The Elder Scrolls: Arena. Some issues had themed CDs containing the entire back catalogue of a publisher such as Durell, Llamasoft and Gremlin Graphics. On 27 September 2005, the magazine's original publishing company, Live Publishing, went into bankruptcy. The magazine's official online forums described the magazine as \\"finished\\" shortly before issue #19 was due for release. However, rights to Retro Gamer were purchased by Imagine Publishing in October 2005 and the magazine was re-launched on 8 December 2005. Retro Survival is a commercial CD retro games magazine put together by the freelance writers of Retro Gamer when Live Publishing collapsed. The CD was published in November 2005 and contains articles that would have appeared in Issue 19 of Retro Gamer, as well as several extras including a foreword by celebrity games journalist Mr Biffo. In June 2004, a tribute to Zzap!64 was included, \\"The DEF Tribute to Zzap!64\\", celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Commodore 64 focused magazine. Includes interviews with leading 80s and 90s programmers such as David Crane, Matthew Smith and Archer MacLean. Regular columns also feature such as Back to the 80s and 90s, Desert Island Disks (what games would a gaming celebrity take to a desert island) and From the Archives (a profile of a particular game developer or publisher). The 'Making Of's' is a recurring feature in which well-known developers are interviewed about the creation and design process behind their games.

A contemporary of fellow Lancastrians George Formby and Gracie Fields, he was regarded as more subversive, perhaps explaining why the immense popularity he enjoyed during his lifetime has not survived him. ==Life and career== Randle was born in Aspull, near Wigan, Lancashire, to an unmarried Rhoda Heathcoate Hughes. He left school aged 13 and worked in a variety of menial jobs until two years later when he joined an acrobatic troupe. He took the name Arthur McEvoy after his mother married Richard McEvoy. In 1928 Randle began to tour as a comedian, principally in Lancashire and Northern England. Randle appeared on stage carrying a red warning lamp, similar to the type found around road works, declaring \\"Look what some dam'd fool left in’t road\\". He developed his own show, Randle's Scandals, which in the 1950s featured Roy Castle. Randle's mischievous wit led to a running conflict with Harry Barnes, a police chief of the Lancashire seaside resort of Blackpool, who frequently banned him from performing in the town's venues. He was prosecuted in 1952 on four charges of obscenity and fined £10 on each count. Randle responded to his critics in robust fashion, frequently throwing his false teeth into the audience and once bombarding Blackpool from an aeroplane with toilet rolls (according to an episode of Rude Britannia, broadcast by the BBC on 15 June 2010, the toilet roll bombardment actually took place over Accrington, not Blackpool). Randle's police charge sheet is lodged with Lancashire Archives.Lancashire Archives, PLA, accession 6401 On the outbreak of the Second World War, and having failed his medical to join the RAF, Randle joined the Home Guard and established a career in film. His iconoclastic portrayal of the underdog, flouting authority and disrupting the establishment, found a ready audience in a population suffering the privations of war. He took equity in John E. Blakeley's Manchester-based Mancunian Film Studios, appearing in eight of its productions. In his last film, It's a Grand Life (1953), his co-star was Diana Dors. Frank Randle's grave With the decline of Variety in the 1950s Randle's popularity faded. Pressed by debts and tax arrears, and suffering from the consequences of a life of alcohol abuse, he was made bankrupt by the tax authorities in 1955. He died in Blackpool of gastroenteritis in 1957 and is buried in Carleton Cemetery, Blackpool. He had married May Annie Victoria Douglas, known as Queenie, in 1928 in Greenwich, London. There were no children but Manchester artist Arthur Delaney was alleged to be Randle's illegitimate son by fellow performer Genevieve Delaney (also known as Eve Delaney). Randle's comedy achievement was celebrated in \\"Grin up North\\", a major touring exhibition that looked at the unique Northern sense of humour. He was most recently featured in an episode of BBC 4's Rude Britannia shown in June 2010. In 2007 a celebratory plaque paid for by members of the Cuthbert Club was unveiled to Randle on Blackpool's North Pier. In 2010 the same organisation paid for the refurbishment of Randle's gravestone, which was unveiled in July 2010. ==Filmography== * Somewhere in England (1940) * Somewhere in Camp (1942) * Somewhere on Leave (1943) * Somewhere in Civvies (1943) * Home Sweet Home (1945) * Holidays with Pay (1948) * When You Come Home (1948) * Somewhere in Politics (1949) * School for Randle (1949) * It's a Grand Life (1953) ==References== Notes Bibliography * ==Further reading== * Nuttall, J.

M. (2004). Beckwith, Sir Thomas Sydney (1772–1831), rev. Roger T. Stearn, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. He is most notable for his distinguished service during the Peninsular War and for his contributions to the development and command of the 95th Rifles.Urban, M. (2003). Rifles: Six years with Wellington's legendary sharpshooters. Faber and Faber. ==Family== His father was Major General John Beckwith, who commanded the 20th Regiment of Foot. His brothers were Captain John Beckwith, Sir George Beckwith and Brigadier General Ferdinand Beckwith. He was also the uncle of Major-General John Charles Beckwith. He entered the Army himself in 1791, joining the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot, and served with them in India. In 1817, he married Lady Mary Douglas, eldest daughter of Sir William Douglas, 4th Baronet of Kelhead. His wife, whose brothers Charles and John succeeded as Marquess of Queensberry, was elevated to the rank of a daughter of a marquess by royal warrant. Their only son, Thomas Sydney Beckwith, was a Captain in the Rifle Brigade, and died in Gibraltar on 21 March 1828. ==Service with the 95th Rifles== In 1800, he was appointed to command a company in Colonel Coote Manningham's \\"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\\", which later was designated the 95th Regiment and subsequently the Rifle Brigade. He was promoted to Major within the Corps in 1802. The next year, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and took command of the 1st Battalion. Beckwith was one of the favourite officers of Sir John Moore in the famous camp of Shorncliffe, and aided that general in the training of the troops which afterwards became the Light Division. He served on the expeditions to Hanover in 1806 and Copenhagen in 1807, before joining the expedition to the Peninsula under Major General Arthur Wellesley. He took part in the Battle of Vimeiro, and the expedition into Spain under Sir John Moore, in which the Rifles bore the brunt of the rearguard fighting. The next year, he returned to Portugal and was appointed to command the 1st Brigade of the Light Division. Beckwith took part in Craufurd's great march to the field of Talavera. In 1810, during the French invasion of Portugal, he was present at the Battle of the Coa and the Battle of Busaco. During the subsequent operations to drive the French from Portugal, he fought at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro, and distinguished himself at the Battle of Sabugal. ==Quartermaster General== In 1812, he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster General to the British forces in North America. As such, he commanded the troops which were sent to Chesapeake Bay in 1813. He had only one regiment of infantry and some undisciplined French former prisoners of war, the Independent Companies of Foreigners. At the Battle of Craney Island, Beckwith's troops were repulsed by shore batteries while attempting to land.Forester, C. S. The Age of Fighting Sail, New English Library, . He subsequently captured Hampton, Virginia but the men of the Independent Companies misbehaved, giving Beckwith's troops an evil reputation for atrocities. In 1814, he was promoted to Major General and appointed Quartermaster General to the troops in Canada under Sir George Prevost. Prevost's expedition into New York was defeated at the Battle of Plattsburgh. The Peninsular veterans in the force considered that Prevost and his staff (including Beckwith) were at least partly responsible for the defeat (in Beckwith's case, for failure to provide sufficient intelligence on the geography and enemy dispositions). Beckwith was made a Knight Bachelor in 1812 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815. In 1827, he was made Colonel Commandant of his old corps, the Rifle Brigade. ==Later service in India== In 1829, he was appointed Commander in Chief of the Bombay Army. In 1830, he was promoted Lieutenant General, but died of fever the following year at Mahableshwar. ==See also== * Baker rifle * History of British light infantry * British Army during the Napoleonic Wars ==References== ;Bibliography * * * Category:1770 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:British Army personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:British Army personnel of the War of 1812 Category:British Army generals Category:Pre-Confederation Ontario people Category:Rifle Brigade officers Category:Governors of Bombay Category:Commanders-in-chief of Bombay Category:71st Highlanders officers Category:Knights of the Order of the Tower and Sword ","title":"Thomas Sydney Beckwith"},{"id":"2000364","text":"The AWA America's Championship was a very short-lived title in the American Wrestling Association that was created to play upon Sgt.

He is known as the inventor and improver of astronomical and other scientific apparatus, as a striking instance of self education and as an itinerant lecturer. ==Biography== Ferguson was born near Rothiemay in Banffshire of humble parents. According to his autobiography, he learned to read by hearing his father teach his elder brother, and with the help of an old woman was able to read quite well before his father thought of teaching him. After his father taught him to write, he was sent at the age of seven for three months to the grammar school at Keith and that was all the formal education he ever received. His taste for mechanics was about this time accidentally awakened on seeing his father making use of a lever to raise a part of the roof of his house -- an exhibition of strength which excited his wonder. In 1720 he was sent to a neighboring farm to keep sheep, where he amused himself by making models of machines, and at night he studied the stars. Afterwards, as a servant with a miller, and then with a doctor, he met with hardships which rendered his constitution feeble through life. Being compelled by his health to return home, he then amused himself with making a clock having wooden wheels and a whalebone spring. When slightly recovered he showed this and some other inventions to a gentleman, who employed him to clean his clocks, and to make his house his home. He there began to draw patterns for needlework, and his success in this art led him to think of becoming a painter. In 1734 he went to Edinburgh, where he began to make portraits in miniature, by which means, while engaged in his scientific studies, he supported himself and his family for many years. Subsequently, he settled at Inverness, where he drew up his Astronomical Rotula for showing the motions of the planets, places of the sun and moon, &c.;, and in 1743 went to London, England, which was his home for the rest of his life. He wrote various papers for the Royal Society of London, of which he became a Fellow in November 1763. He devised astronomical and mechanical models, like globes. Ferguson's globes were inspired by the early 18th Century globes of John Senex. Senex sold him the copper plates for his globe gores, but not the copper plates used for Senex's pocket globe gores. Consequently, Ferguson designed his own pocket globe, producing several editions. Ferguson had some Senex gores re-engraved by a certain James Mynde, showing Admiral Anson's voyages of the years 1740–1744.George Glazer James Ferguson www.georgeglazer.com, n.d., retrieved January 2017 In 1748, Ferguson began to give public lectures on experimental philosophy, which he repeated in most of the principal towns in England. During his time traveling in England, the well known London bookseller Andrew Millar arranged lectures for him in the spa towns of Royal Tunbridge Wells and Bath. Ferguson's deep interest in his subject, his clear explanations, his ingeniously constructed diagrams, and his mechanical apparatus rendered him one of the most successful of popular lecturers on scientific subjects. As the inventor and improver of astronomical and other scientific apparatus, and as a striking instance of self education, he claims a place among the most remarkable Scottish scientists. During the latter years of his life he received a pension of £50 from the privy purse. He died in London on 17 November 1776 and was buried in St Marylebone churchyard. ==Legacy== Although not as well known nowadays, Ferguson was widely influential in his own time. Thomas Paine mentioned him in his publication \\"The Age of Reason\\" and William Herschel studied astronomy from his books.James Ferguson (1710-1776) Famous sons of Rothiemay, district of Rothiemay, n.d., retrieved January 10, 2017 The German experimental physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg admired Ferguson: \\"Everything was done by experiments – he had not even chalk and sponge.\\" Unpublished manuscript of a university lecture.

The club has won the Championship six times and three Challenge Cups. Before 1996, the club was known simply as Swinton. ==HistoryEarly years=== The club was formed in 1866 when members of Swinton Cricket Club decided to take up \\"football\\" in the winter to keep fit. Other than an annual challenge against the local Lancashire Rifle Volunteers from 1869, the only games played were amongst the club's own membership. In 1871, they joined the Rugby Football Union as \\"Swinton and Pendlebury F.C.\\", playing their first game at Burying Lane against Eccles Standard. The team quickly became virtually unbeatable in the Manchester area and beyond. This rise in stature was surprising because Swinton and Pendlebury was a tiny colliery village with a few cotton mills, but it had a large number of local junior teams from which the club drew its talent. In 1873, they moved from Burying Lane (Station Road from circa 1889) to a ground known as Stoneacre, and used the nearby White Lion public house as changing rooms. They have been known as the Lions ever since. Having gone three years undefeated in the mid-1870s, the Lions gradually sought a tougher fixture list. In 1878, the club ventured into Yorkshire, and was soon travelling throughout England taking on opponents including Oxford University. Such was the Lions' success that by the mid-1880s Swinton had become recognised as a national force and were considered the strongest team in Lancashire. The first rugby match under floodlights took place in Salford, between Broughton and Swinton on 22 October 1878. Swinton team of 1881 In 1886, they moved to Chorley Road. The new ground could accommodate much larger crowds and the staging of County matches added to Swinton's growing reputation. The Lions produced several England internationals and dozens more who gained representative recognition wearing the red rose of Lancashire. They were initially reluctant to join the new Northern Union, but did so on 2 June 1896 due to the fact that the majority of other teams in the area had done so, causing financial hardship to the club. The Northern Union was then split into two county leagues, Lancashire and Yorkshire. In 1900, led by Jim Valentine, they won the Rugby League Challenge Cup defeating Salford at Fallowfield, Manchester. On Saturday 8 September 1906, Swinton hosted a Pontefract team who arrived with only 12 players. The Lions scored 18 tries in a club record 76–4 victory. This record would stand for ninety years but three months later when the Lions visited Pontefract they lost 5–0. The period leading up to the Great War was not particularly auspicious for the Lions. Financial crisis followed financial crisis and only the sale of the main stand saved the club from closure during 1917. The war took the lives of 13 Swinton players, but back home the Lions played on throughout in a desperate attempt to stay afloat. ===Inter-war period=== Lions' directors managed to call upon the support of local businessmen. The signings of Hector Halsall, a centre and future captain, and Albert Jenkins, a Welsh half-back, provided the catalyst. Throughout the 1920s the Lions got better and better, they beat the visiting Australasian team of the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain 9–0. At last they won the Lancashire County Cup in 1925 before recapturing the Challenge Cup in 1926. They then followed this with their first-ever Championship a year later, and in 1928 the team reached its zenith becoming the last team to secure All Four Cups; they were also the only side from Lancashire to achieve this feat (Hunslet and Huddersfield were the two other clubs). In addition to the Championship Trophy, the Challenge Cup, the Lancashire League and the Lancashire Cup; Swinton won a fifth cup, the Salford Royal Hospital Cup, which was competed for by Salford, Broughton Rangers and Swinton. Crowds in excess of 20,000 were commonplace at Chorley Road. A traditional Swinton jersey design Under captain, Hector Halsall, the Lions were a side with a strong Welsh presence, with players like Billo Rees as well as the Cumbrian goal- kicking second row forward, Martin Hodgson who signed for Swinton in January 1927. Hodgson still holds the long distance penalty goal world record with a kick of 77¾ yards (at the Athletic Grounds, Rochdale Hornets, in April 1940). The 1927–28 season saw the Lions sweep all before them. They topped both the Championship and the Lancashire League, having already defeated Wigan in the Lancashire Cup. In a tense Challenge Cup Final they squeezed past Warrington 5–3, and three weeks later the Holy Grail was achieved when they comfortably eased past Featherstone Rovers 11–0 to take the Rugby Football League Championship. A rent dispute in 1928 caused the club to search for pastures new. In 1929, the club then moved to a new stadium back near their original home off Station Road, taking the old stands with them. This new stadium's name was named after its location, Station Road. In March 1929, a 22,000 thousand crowd saw the Lions defeat Wigan in the first match on new turf. This soon became a favoured ground for major fixtures such as Test matches, Challenge Cup semi-finals, Lancashire Cup finals and Championship finals. Further Championships were won in 1931 and 1935. Swinton won the Lancashire Cup against Widnes in 1940, but thereafter the war curtailed the promise of further progress. In 1941–42, Swinton abandoned the Lancashire League due to the Second World War and did not return until the 1945–46 season. ===Post- war=== Throughout the late 1940s, and the 1950s the Lions strove unsuccessfully to repeat former glories and often flattered to deceive, but the appointment of Welshman Cliff Evans as coach signalled a renaissance. Concentrating on a youth policy and training methods beyond his era, Evans began to model an exciting, young Swinton team. This new era saw some notable Welshmen in the Lions' ranks such as Rees Thomas, Ralph Morgan, Frank Osmond, Dai Moses, Ron Morgan and Graham Rees. Also in the 'swinging 1960s' years the Lions fielded real top class performers such as GB internationals Ken Gowers at full-back, Alan Buckley at left-centre plus his wing partner, John Stopford. During this same decade, local talent came to the fore with the likes of Graham Williams (scrum-half), Derek Whitehead (full-back/utility), Barry Simpson (2nd-row) and classy GB loose-forward Dave Robinson. During the second half of the decade other prominent players turned out for the Lions. Of these, perhaps the most worthy were stand-off Billy 'Daz' Davies, scrum-half Peter Kenny and 2nd-rowers Rod Smith (ex-Workington Town) and the highly respected Bill Holliday (ex-Whitehaven, Hull Kingston Rovers, Cumberland and GB). In fact it was the Lions 1960s quartet of Gowers, Buckley, Stopford and Robinson who were selected to play for the GB tourists on the 1966 tour to Australasia. Gowers was even given the honour of being awarded the position of tour vice-captain. However, some critics saw this as an apology for overlooking him when the previous tourists were chosen in 1962, when many believe he was easily the most outstanding player to wear a full-back's jersey in the British game. A proposal in 1960 to create a Manchester rugby league club at the former White City Stadium on Chester Road, Old Trafford, Stretford, received strong opposition from Salford and Swinton. Their protests were renewed when a match was staged there between a Manchester XIII (Salford and Swinton players) and the New Zealand tourists in September 1961 and the idea was subsequently dropped. Swinton made it to the final of the Lancashire County Cup in three consecutive seasons 1960–61, 1961–62 and 1962–63 plus 1964–65 but lost to St. Helens on each occasion at Central Park, Wigan. However, by the end of the 1960s they finally lifted the trophy after overcoming a strong Leigh side 11-2 led by Alex Murphy. Their victorious captain that early November day in 1969 at Central Park, Wigan was long serving dependable right-centre Bob Fleet. Swinton became Champions of the Rugby Football League Championship in the 1962–63 season. Led by coach Cliff Evans and inspirational skipper Albert Blan, the team recovered from a slow start to complete the final backlogged 18 games (delayed due to the severe winter weather) of a 30-match league calendar undefeated to walk away with the Championship. Swinton's 6th Championship was retained in style 12 months later (1963–64). As Swinton coach in the late 1960s/early 1970s, Albert Blan guided the team to a fourth and final Lancashire County Cup success in the 1969–70 Final against Leigh by 11–2 at Central Park, Wigan. When two divisions were reintroduced in 1973, Swinton were out of the top flight, and have struggled to regain their former glories ever since. By the end of the 1970s the club had hit rock-bottom, even though Station Road continued to host semi-finals and finals. Initially under Frank Myler, and then under Jim Crellin, the Lions briefly threatened a revival during the 1980s. Players such as Les Holliday (son of Bill) and Danny Wilson offered great hope for the future, but despite a Second Division Premiership success in 1987, three separate promotions simply brought about three immediate relegations. Swinton offered Leigh the option of a ground share at Station Road in June 1991 but they turned it down. In 1992, financial mis-management necessitated the sale of Station Road for property development. The club moved to Gigg Lane, Bury, the home of Bury F.C. In the Lions' last season at Station Road they were drawing crowds of 3,000 but this sudden move caused the club to lose many supporters.Swinton return from the wilderness Swinton were saved from liquidation by a consortium headed by former chairman Malcolm White in January 1993. ===1996–2019: Summer era=== Old Club Crest In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. The rest of the professional game in Britain would follow this move to summer. In 1996, Swinton officially added Lions to their name. Peter Roe led Swinton to promotion from Division Two in 1996. The former Great Britain captain, Mike Gregory was the head coach of the club between 1998 and 2001. The popular but ultimately disastrous reign of Tony Humphreys followed in the early period of 2002. Humphreys was sacked in late May 2002 and replaced by former player Phil Veivers. Under the guidance of Veivers performances and result improved significantly and the Lions finished in a promotional playoff position. Only a loss to Sheffield Eagles denied the Lions the opportunity of promotion to National League One. The financial failure of major creditor and de facto owner Hugh Eaves in 2002 put the future of the club in jeopardy, the chairman and benefactor Malcolm White resigned. The Swinton Supporters' Trust began life on 14 February 2002 in the White Lion public house and set about raising funds for the club. Shortly afterwards, Swinton were forced out of Gigg Lane by the financial problems of their landlords, Bury F.C.Reborn Lions happy to walk into Wigan's den In August 2002, the club were brought the club back to within one mile of the Swinton and Pendlebury border when they played their first match at Moor Lane in Kersal as tenants of Salford City F.C., after travelling to Leigh and Chorley to play 'home' matches. Unfortunately the football club would not grant Swinton a ten-year lease which would be required to enable much needed funding to bring the ground up to standard. In 2004, the Lions moved to Park Lane, Whitefield, home of Sedgley Park R.U.F.C. Peter Roe quit as coach of Swinton Lions in September 2003, after less than a year in charge. He rejected a two-year contract to continue as the coach and general manager and left the National League Two club.Ward set to retire after passion fades In 2006, the return to Swinton and Pendlebury was taken one step further when club chairman, John Kidd, announced on 9 August that the club had acquired a site to build a 6,000 capacity stadium with training facilities and community use in Agecroft, Pendlebury. In May 2007, Swinton Lions went into administration for about 48 hours to restructure the club from top to bottom. A new company, Swinton Lions Rugby Club, was set up to remove problems with shareholdings from the previous administration. The club came under the stewardship of chairman, John Kidd and fellow directors Paul Kidd (chairman's son), Dave Roberts and Ben Jones. In May 2009, John Kidd announced that he hoped to be in a position to apply for planning permission from the local council by the autumn. Once given approval by Salford Council it was envisaged that construction could be completed quickly. During the autumn of 2009 director Paul Kidd stood down as head coach and moved to his new role as director of rugby. It was also announced that the new player/coach for season 2010 would be Paul Smith with Ian Watson as his assistant player/coach. During the season, on 25 May 2010, Paul Smith announced his resignation from his head coach role and left to play for Leigh. He was replaced by Paul Kidd and Ian Watson. On 26 September 2010, former Barrow coach Steve McCormack was confirmed as the head coach for the 2011 season with Ian Watson and Marlon Billy continuing in their roles as assistant coaches. Swinton played their home games for the 2011 season at the Willows, Weaste, Salford. Swinton went on to win promotion to the Co-operative Championship as Champions of Championship 1. As of 7 June 2011 when the club hosted a fans' meeting at Moorside Social Club, Swinton, Mr Kidd stated that he expected that the building of the stadium should commence no later than New Year's Day, 2012 with completion set for the end of April (2012). However, the predicted return date of spring 2012 proved to be a somewhat optimistic and premature forecast. Ultimately the funding did not materialise and the club later relinquished its lease on the Agecroft site. With Salford moving to a new stadium in Barton, Eccles, Swinton set up a ground-share with Leigh in the Co-operative Championship for the 2012 season and onwards whilst they await permission to build their own ground at Agecroft. On 18 March 2013 the club announced the appointment of Gary Chambers as head coach. Gary, a teacher at Harrop Fold School in Walkden. By late 2013 the club was found to be in severe financial difficulties. Chairman John Kidd announced his resignation and hopes of saving the club were left in the hands of director David Jones and the Supporters' Trust. Alan Marshall and Stephen Wild were nominated by the Supporters' Trust to fill two positions on the new Board of Directors. Ian Watson took over as player-coach. In January 2014, Salford City Reds owner Marwan Koukash announced his intention to revolutionise Swinton town centre via the development of St Ambrose Barlow RC High School. His plans were to include a 3,000 capacity stadium for the Lions on the site of the old school playing field, alongside new housing, restaurants and a hotel. In June 2014, Ian Watson left to join Salford and John Duffy replaced him as head coach in July. A difficult season combined with drastic restructuring of the league structure left the Lions in the third tier of rugby league, League 1, in 2015. In October 2014 the club announced its intention to return to Park Lane, home of Sedgley Park RUFC as its home base for season 2015. Following their promotion from League 1 to the Championship in 2015, Swinton were forced to play their home league games in nearby Salford and Widnes as Park Lane (Sedgley Park RUFC) did not meet the minimum requirements for the Championship, before moving to Heywood Road, Sale. As of March 2016 the club has re-engaged with the project to establish a community stadium in the Agecroft district of Pendlebury. In July 2017 after a very poor season on the field and serious financial problems off it, coach John Duffy departed and took a new coaching post with Featherstone Rovers after their man in charge, Jon Sharp left his post. He was immediately replaced by former player and assistant coach Stuart Littler. On 5 September 2017 the club announced that former Leigh Director Andy Mazey owner of Greater Manchester based S. R. Waite Group would step in as the new club chairman. Since Mazey's arrival the board now includes former Manchester United Brand Manager Tony Sheridan, former Wigan Athletic footballer John Coyne, and Tecmark Managing Director Richard Heyes. In September 2019 the club announced that they were seeking permission from the Rugby Football League to rebrand the club as Manchester Lions from the 2020 season onwards. The official name of the club would remain Swinton Lions but the branding and presentation would all become Manchester. The plan was met with considerable opposition including local councillors and the Mayor of Salford; threats of violence were also reported against the members of the board. As a result of the opposition the entire board resigned on 12 September 2019 with a sole interim director appointed to prevent the club going into administration; the Lions supporters trust were asked to take the club forward. A month later, on 2 October 2019, the RFL placed the club into special measures due to continuing uncertainties about the governance of the club. ==Coaches== * Sam Jones 1945 * Albert Jenkins 1945–1951 * Griff Jenkins 1951–1954 * Cliff Evans 1954–1967 * Dai Moses 1967–1968 * Albert Blan 1968–1971 * David Mortimer 1971–1972 * Rees Thomas 1972–1974 * Austin Rhodes 1974–1975 * Bobby Fleet 1975–1976 * Johnny Stopford 1976–1977 * Bobby Fleet 1977 * Terry Gorman 1977–1978 * Ken Halliwell 1978–1979 * Bobby Fleet 1979 * Stan Gittins 1979–1980 * Frank Myler 1980–1981 * Tom Grainey 1981–1983 * Jim Crellin 1983–1986 * Bill Holliday & Mike Peers 1986–1987 * Peter Smethurst 1987–1988 * Frank Barrow 1988–1989 * Jim Crellin 1989–1991 * Chris O'Sullivan 1991 * Tony Barrow 1992–1996 * Peter Roe 1996–1997 * Les Holliday 1997–1999 * Mike Gregory 1999–2001 * Tony Humphries 2001–2002 * Tony Barrow 2002 * Phil Veivers 2002 * Peter Roe 2003 * Paul Kidd 2004–2009 * Paul Smith 2010 * Paul Kidd 2010 * Steve McCormack 2011–2012 * Gary Chambers 2013 * Ian Watson 2014 * John Duffy 2014-2017 * Stuart Littler 2017- ==2020 squad2020 transfers== Gains {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !

On 27 September 1929, Andrew Caldecott became the Founder President of Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur. ==Early years== Andrew Caldecott was born on 26 October 1884 in Boxley, Kent, United Kingdom. He was the eldest child of Rev Andrew Caldecott and Isobel Mary Johnson.John O'Regan, \\"Caldecott, Sir Andrew (1884-1951)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 5th edition, Oxford University Press, 2004. His mother was the daughter of Rev Stenning Johnson. Lieutenant John Leslie Caldecott (1886 – 9 September 1914), Andrew's younger brother, had served in the Royal Garrison Artillery, who later served as the aide-de-camp to the Governor of Nyasaland. John participated in World War I and died on 9 September 1914 in Nyasaland, Africa (present-day Malawi) at the age of 28, with his remains buried at the Karonga War Cemetery.\\"Malawi\\", South Africa War Graves Project, retrieved 12 May 2009. ==Education== Andrew Caldecott studied at Uppingham School in Rutland and was awarded scholarships, enabling him to be admitted to Exeter College of the University of Oxford. He achieved outstanding academic results while in college and had been awarded scholarships. He gained a third class in Classical Honour Moderations and subsequently graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Classics (second-class honours) in 1907. In 1948, he was conferred as an Honorary Fellow by Exeter College.\\"CALDECOTT, Sir Andrew\\", Who Was Who, London: A & C Black, 1996. ==CareerMalayan career=== Upon his graduation from college in 1907, Caldecott joined the Colonial Office in November of the same year and was posted to Malaya. He initially worked in Negeri Sembilan as a Cadet of the Federated Malay States (FMS).Association of British Malaya, British Malaya, Newton & Company, 1936. He served as Acting District Officer (DO) of Jelebu from 1909 to 1911. In 1911, he was appointed as Acting DO of Kuala Pilah, and was transferred back to Jelebu to serve as DO in the same year. He was re-appointed Acting DO of Kuala Pilah in the following year.The Colonial Office List, London: His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1923. In 1913, Caldecott was transferred to the Federal Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur and assumed the office of Deputy Controller of Labour. He subsequently held various positions, including Assistant Secretary (AS) to the Chief Secretary (1914 – 1916), 2nd AS to the Federal Secretary (1916 – 1920) and Acting AS to the colonial government (1920 – 1922). Caldecott went on leave from September 1922; he took up the ad hoc appointment as Malayan Commissioner at the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley Park in the United Kingdom in 1924 and 1925. During the exhibition, he was in charge of the coordination of the Malaya Pavilion. Thereafter, he was conferred CBE by the British Government. After the exhibition, Caldecott returned to Malaya in March 1926 and worked as Town Planning Administrator and State Valuer of Ipoh; he was transferred to the Housing and Public Works Department Enquiry Committees as Chairman in December 1926.The Colonial Office List, London: His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1948. He was appointed Deputy Controller of Labour and Acting Under-Secretary to the Straits Settlements in July 1927, until 1928, when he was promoted to Secretary for Postal Affairs of the Straits Settlements and FMS as Officer, Class 1A. Since then, Caldecott had been assigned to serve in local authorities; he became Acting Resident of Negeri Sembilan in 1929 and Acting Resident of Perak from 1930 to 1931. He was appointed to serve as Resident of Selangor, until March 1932, when he was transferred back to the central government of FMS as Chief Secretary. He served as Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements from May 1933 to February 1934. On 17 February 1934, Caldecott worked as Acting Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner of FMS, when Sir Cecil Clementi, the then-Governor of the Straits Settlements retired due to illness. During his tenure as Acting Governor, Caldecott upheld Clementi's policy of decentralisation.\\"Sir Andrew Caldecott - Distinguished Services Rendered in Straits and F.M.S. - 28 Years Endeared Him to All Classes\\", The China Mail, 12 December 1935, p. 6. He was re-appointed Colonial Secretary when Sir Shenton Thomas took office in 9 November 1934. During his time in Malaya, Caldecott earned a reputation for his ability to settle disputes between different ethnic groups which made him popular with all races, a rare feat for a colonial administrator given the diversity of the Straits Settlements population. He also served as the first president of the Football Association of Malaysia. ===Governor of Hong Kong=== In 1935, Caldecott was appointed governor of Hong Kong. His tenure was the shortest in Hong Kong colonial history, for he was appointed the second last Governor of Ceylon a little more than a year later to handle the threat to the British administration caused by the overwhelming national liberation movement in Ceylon. When arriving in Hong Kong to assume the Governorship, Caldecott, unusually, elected to wear civilian dress, something that would not happen again until the arrival, in 1992, of the last colonial Governor, Chris Patten. His departure to Ceylon was met with dismay by the community as he had become a respected figure. Locals had petitioned to Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for him to remain but to no avail. It was during Caldecott's tenure that Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport received its first regular arrival, the \\"Dorado\\" and the Queen Mary Hospital opened as an adjunct hospital to the Hong Kong University (the hospital is now under the control of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority). Caldecott called the promotion of Chinese civil servants to replace the European ones, a policy not realized until the signage of Sino- British Joint Declaration in 1984. His tenure also saw the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, with more than 100,000 refugees from the Chinese Mainland flooding into Hong Kong to escape the conflict. ===Governor of Ceylon=== He was sent to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) to examine the situation in the island closely and report on issues such as the governing structure, the representation of the minority communities, the franchise etc. His observations regarding these issues had an important impact on the evolution of the Ceylon constitution. Caldecott was governor during World War II. During his governance, in 1938, the first diesel locomotive ran to Galle, in 1939, the Bank of Ceylon opened, and, in 1942, the University of Ceylon was established. ==Personal life== Caldecott married Olive Mary Innes, daughter of J. R. Innes, CMG in 1918. He knew his wife while she served as a civil servant in Malaya. She died of illness in Ceylon in 1943. Following her death, Caldecott married Evelyn May Palmer, daughter of Dr J. Robertson and H. Palmer in 1946. Olive bore him a son and a daughter, namely John Andrew Caldecott, CBE (25 February 1924 – 14 July 1990)\\"CALDECOTT, (John) Andrew\\", Who Was Who, London: A & C Black, 1996. and Joan Caldecott. His son was the Chairman of M&G; Group. Caldecott had a wide range of hobbies. He had published many articles with regards to the affairs of Malaya, and had written books about Malayan history in his early years. In his late years, he published two ghost novels. Besides writing, his other hobbies include drawing, playing the piano, tennis and golf. Caldecott composed the melody to the Negeri Sembilan anthem, Berkatlah Yang DiPertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan. ==Works== * History of Jelebu, 1912. * Not Exactly Ghosts, 1947. * Fires Burn Blue, 1948. ==Awards and honours== * C.M.G., 1932 * K.C.M.G., 1937 * G.C.M.G., 1941 * C.B.E., 1926 * K.B.E., 1935 * K.St.J., 1936 * Awarded M.A. in Oxon * Awarded LL.D. in Ceylon * Malayan Commissioner, British Empire Exhibition, 1924-5 * Member, Royal Asiatic Society (M.R.A.S.) * Fellow, Royal Society of Arts (F.R.S.A.) * Honorary Fellow, Royal Philharmonic Society, 1947 ==Places named after Andrew Caldecott== In Hong Kong, Caldecott Road, a road in New Kowloon, is named after him.

Other times, it may be an unofficial prom, planned by the students themselves so that it is not under the control of the school. Some of the more common reasons for the creation of an anti-prom include the desire to curb the large cost of a traditional prom, to listen to music other than that expected to be played at the official prom, to have a smaller, more personal get-together, ones that cannot find a date or have been rejected for a prom date, don't like the food, or have looser and less strict rules than the school's (often relating to dress rules or alcohol consumption). Another common anti-prom is an unofficial dance set up by freshmen and sophomores as they cannot go to prom without a junior or senior. The attendees of an anti-prom usually disagree with the values of the high school in-crowd who, stereotypically, organize the prom from the preparatory stages to the after-parties. In particular, anti-prom attendees protest what they regard as the vanity, excess, and conformity that the prom culture expects from students. Anti-proms do not follow any prescribed format, catering instead to the varied tastes of the large spectrum of students who feel dissociated from prom culture. Nevertheless, anti-prom participants are generally concerned with arranging social activities that are not only fun and enjoyable, but which also serve as an assertion of solidarity and of the legitimacy of social difference. In the United States, youth belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints often attend morps organized through their church or stake. This is true even in the state of Utah, where a substantial percentage of the youth belong to Mormon families. The custom is that the girls can each ask a boy to take them, but the boys cannot ask the girls ==Queer proms== Sexual orientation and gender identity sometimes plays a role in leading students to form and attend an anti-prom (sometimes referred to as a gay prom or queer prom): lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) students who feel that attending their school's traditional prom with a same-sex partner or not identifying in traditional gender identity fashion would be problematic might choose to hold their own gathering. Gay proms began to form in the 1990s, with one of the longest running and oldest being the Hayward Gay Prom, which was first held in 1995. ==References== Category:American culture Category:School dances Category:LGBT culture in the United States ru:Выпускной вечер#Антивыпускной ","title":"Anti-prom"},{"id":"2000394","text":"The problem of reconstruction from zero crossings can be stated as: given the zero crossings of a continuous signal, is it possible to reconstruct the signal (to within a constant factor)? Worded differently, what are the conditions under which a signal can be reconstructed from its zero crossings? This problem has two parts. Firstly, proving that there is a unique reconstruction of the signal from the zero crossings, and secondly, how to actually go about reconstructing the signal. Though there have been quite a few attempts, no conclusive solution has yet been found. Ben Logan from Bell Labs wrote an article in 1977 in the Bell System Technical Journal giving some criteria under which unique reconstruction is possible. Though this has been a major step towards the solution, many people are dissatisfied with the type of condition that results from his article. According to Logan, a signal is uniquely reconstructible from its zero crossings if: # The signal x(t) and its Hilbert transform xt have no zeros in common with each other. # The frequency- domain representation of the signal is at most 1 octave long, in other words, it is bandpass-limited between some frequencies B and 2B. == Further reading == * B.

They surveyed pilots and operators of other brands of agricultural aircraft to see what features and capabilities these operators were looking for. The resulting aircraft was a conventional single-seat, piston-engined, strut-braced low-wing agricultural airplane. The Cessna 188 borrowed heavily from the Cessna 180, the initial version using the same tail cone and fin structure as well as the same Continental O-470-R 230 hp (170 kW) powerplant. The 188's airframe is predominantly built from 2024-T3 aluminum, with the chemical hopper constructed from fiberglass. The fuselage is of semi-monocoque construction and is lightly pressurized on later models (using the dynamic pressure resulting from the aircraft's forward speed) to reduce induction of chemicals into the airframe. The Cessna 188 was first flown on 19 February 1965. The aircraft was certified and entered production in February 1966, with 241 aircraft delivered the first year. The initial design of the Cessna 188 was so successful that over its 17-year production run the basic airframe remained unchanged. Only the engines and the agricultural products dispensing systems were upgraded, other than some minor changes to the ventilation systems. The main use for the Cessna 188 series was for agricultural purposes, but many examples were later acquired for use as glider and sailplane tugs. A total of 3976 Cessna 188s of all four variants were built during its production run, made up of 53 AGpickups, 1589 AGwagons, 1949 AGtrucks and 385 AGhuskies. ==Variants== ;188 AGwagon 230 :Initial version powered by a Continental O-470-R powerplant, a 200 US gallon (760 liter) chemical hopper, with a normal category gross weight of and in the restricted category.

The street was originally commercial in nature due to the many working piers along the waterfront; parts of it have been extensively rebuilt in since the 1970s with parks, condominiums, retail, as well as institutional and cultural development. ==History== The road supplanted both Front Street and Lake Shore Boulevard as the most southerly east–west corridor in the city when it was created on reclaimed land in the inner harbour. Sometime after 1919 to the early 1920s the inner harbour was filled in and new slips were created. Queens Quay in 1910 Queens Quay continues to go through a significant transformation. Originally, it served as an access road for the various ports and slips in the inner harbour. The street between Yonge Street and Parliament Street was home to storage buildings devoted to trade on the Saint Lawrence Seaway, major industries such as the Redpath Sugar Refinery and Victory Mills, as well as small commercial enterprises. However, the mainly industrial uses along Queens Quay were slowly replaced by commercial and residential uses, mainly high-rise condominiums. Between 1975 and 1979, a cluster of large, concrete towers were erected at the foot of Bay Street, south of Queens Quay; these included the Westin Harbour Castle and Harbour Square. In 1990, the 40-storey York Quay towers were built and remain the tallest buildings on Queens Quay.Development The scale and density of these and subsequent high-rise development along Queens Quay were criticized for blocking the lake and failing to provide a welcoming realm for visitors. In 1997 City School (Toronto) relocated to 635 Queens Quay West.http://www2.tdsb.on.ca/MOSS/asp_apps/school_landing_page/pdfs/web/5288_4pageLayout.pdf In 1999, the Toronto Transit Commission opened a dedicated streetcar right-of- way in the median from Bay Street to Bathurst Street. In 2001, the city planners set out to improve Queens Quay by reclaiming public space for pedestrians and cyclists. This resulted in the Waterfront Toronto Central Waterfront Public Realm International Design Competition, which was completed in 2006. In August 2006, the city closed the two eastbound lanes, replacing them with bike lanes as part of the Martin Goodman Trail and additional pedestrian space. The experiment resulted in an improved public realm and more visitors to the overall waterfront area.Experiment In 2009, Waterfront Toronto announced its plans to turn Queens Quay into a grand lakefront boulevard by placing streetcar lanes in the centre, traffic only on the north side and a pedestrian-focused space on the south side.\\"City Council approves plan to transform Queens Quay.\\" Canada NewsWire. Oct 1, 2009. The plan would restrict Queen's Quay to two traffic lanes, on the north side of the streetcar tracks, similar to the design of the 2006 experiment. Additionally, the plan calls for the beautification and extension of the Harbourfront streetcar line along Queen's Quay East between Yonge and Cherry Street. The transit right-of- way will be grass-covered.Master Plan In 2013 two open spaces opens, Ontario Square and Canada Square. The former is an open public space and the latter a green area. Both replace the former parking lot, which is now underground. ==Transportation== Queens Quay is served by two streetcar lines, operating on a dedicated right-of-way. The 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina both terminate at Union Station and run along Queens Quay from Bay Street, westward. At Spadina Avenue, the 510 heads north to Spadina station, and the 509 continues west, bound for the Exhibition Loop.James Bow. \\"Route 509 - The New Harbourfront Streetcar .\\" Transit Toronto.

November 10, 2006 Originally there was to have been an underground station in front of the Westin Harbour Castle Hotel and the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal, with underground access to the hotel. This plan was cancelled when the hotel management became unwilling to share in the cost, and a smaller station was built around the corner under Bay Street. Plans to add a Queens Quay East light rail line are the subject of a class environmental assessment.www.ene.gov.on.ca Various bus routes currently serve portions of the eastern portion of Queens Quay: the 6 Bay operates from Bay Street to Jarvis Street, the 75 Sherbourne operates from Jarvis Street to Sherbourne Street, and the 97 Yonge and 320 Yonge Blue Night buses operate from Bay Street to Yonge Street. ==Landmarks== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- style=\\"background:lightblue;\\" !Landmark !Cross street !Notes !Image |- |Little Norway Park |Bathurst | |100px |- |Canada Malting Silos |Bathurst |Abandoned storage silos since 1980s; germination and kiln buildings demolished 2010 |100px |- |Toronto Music Garden |Spadina | |100px |- |Walter Carsen Centre |Spadina |headquarters of the National Ballet of Canada |100px |- |Empire Sandy |Spadina | |100px |- |HTO Park |Spadina | |100px |- |Toronto Waterfront WaveDecks | Spadina, Rees, Lower Simcoe | |100px |- |Harbourfront Centre |Lower Simcoe | a cultural centre built by the federal government as part of the Harbourfront Park development |100px |- |Queen's Quay Terminal |York | Built in 1926 as a cold storage warehouse facility turned into condos in the 1980s | 100px |- |Queens Quay station |Bay |Underground LRT station |100px |- |Westin Harbour Castle Hotel |Bay | Built in 1975 as Harbour Castle Hilton and became a Westin hotel in 1987 |100px |- |World Trade Centre |Yonge | |100px |- |Captain John's Harbour Boat Restaurant (1975-2015) |Yonge |Restaurant on a permanently docked boat (Restaurant closed 2011 and ship was removed from dock on May 28, 2015 for recycling in Port Colborne, Ontario) |100px |- |One Yonge Street |Yonge |Toronto Star headquarters |100px |- |Redpath Sugar Refinery |Jarvis |Last active industrial site along the quay |100px |- |The Guvernment |Jarvis |Night club opened in 1980s and closed 2015; demolition began in 2015 as property sold to condo developer Daniels Corporation |100px |- |Sugar Beach |Jarvis | |100px |- |Corus Quay |Jarvis |Home of Corus Entertainment and first major development in the East Bayfront District |100px |- |Victory Soya Mills Silos (Central Soya Mills) |Parliament | Built 1943 and abandoned industrial silos since 1991; designated historic site |100px |} ==Quays and slips along Queens Quay== Listed from west to east * Bathurst Quay (Éireann Quay) - see Ireland Park and Canada Malting Silos * Spadina Quay * Peter Street Slip * Maple Leaf Quays - former site of Maple Leaf Mills Silos * Rees Street Slip * John Street Quay * Simcoe Street Slip * York Quay * York Street Slip * Harbour Square * Yonge Street Slip * Pier 27 * Jarvis Street Slip - now Corus Quay * Redpath Slip * Parliament Street Slip ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Roads in Toronto Category:Harbourfront, Toronto ","title":"Queens Quay (Toronto)"},{"id":"2000444","text":"200px The Mawson Trail is a long-distance cycling trail in South Australia starting just east of Adelaide in the Adelaide Hills and extending almost to Blinman in the Flinders Ranges.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Lesbos, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior Before 1919, its official name was Μόλυβος - Molyvos;Name changes of settlements in Greece that name dates back to the end of the Byzantine Era, but is still in common use today. ==Geography== Aerial photo of Mithymna The second most important town of the island, it is located NE of Eressos, N of Plomari and NW of Mytilene. The town (pop. 1,399 at 2011 census) is on the northern part of the island, just some 6 km north of the popular beach town of Petra. One of the most noticeable features of the town is the old Genoese fortress on the hill in the middle of the town. The town's agora is located on the uphill road to the fortress and is popular among tourists, with many historic shops, cafés and restaurants. The municipal unit of Míthymna stretches eastward from the town along the northern part of the island; it is the island's smallest municipal unit in land area at 50.166 km². Its population was 2,255 at the 2011 census. The next largest towns in the municipal unit are Árgennos (pop. 240) and Sykaminéa (207). Molyvos Beach is one of the Blue Flag beaches in Lesbos. The shoreline is pebbled, but the seabed consists entirely of soft sand and remains shallow for a considerable distance. The agora and fortress are visible from the beach. ==History== As Methymna, the city was once the prosperous second city of Lesbos, with a founding myth that identified an eponymous Methymna (Greek: Μήθυμνα), the daughter of Macar and married to the personification of Lesbos. ===Archaic Period=== View of the port Coin from Methymna (500-480 BC) View to the fortress (Castle of Molyvos) Another view Very little is known about Methymna in the Archaic period. The story of Arion and the dolphin, which involves the Corinthian tyrant Periander and is evidently set at the turn of the 7th century BCE, suggests that Methymna was already a prominent city with far-reaching contacts across the Greek world at this period.Herodotus 1.23-24. Herodotus tells us that at some point in the Archaic period, Methymna enslaved the city of Arisba on Lesbos: this will have greatly increased the territory of Methymna, as well as giving it access to the fertile land around the Gulf of Kalloni.Herodotus 1.151.2, cf. Strabo 13.1.21. Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis 5.139 instead says that Arisba was destroyed by earthquake. We are also told by a local historian, Myrsilus of Methymna, who wrote in the first half of the 3rd century BCE, that Methymna founded the city of Assos which was on the coast of Asia Minor opposite Methymna.Myrsilos FGrHist 477 F 17 = Strabo 13.1.58. However, another local historian, Hellanicus of Lesbos, writing in the mid-5th century BCE, instead simply says Assos was an Aeolian foundation and does not specify a particular city as its founder.Hellanicus FGrHist 4 F 160 = Strabo 13.1.58. This has led some historians to doubt Myrsilus, and instead suggest that this is an example of \\"local Methymnaean manipulation of the past\\", although this could equally be true of Hellanicus.C. Constantakopoulou, Dance of the Islands (2007) 240 n. 51. A further complication is that Alexander Polyhistor FGrHist 273 F 96 = Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. Ἀσσός says that Assos was a colony of Mytilene. However, the editor of Stephanus, Augustus Meineke, commenting on this passage believed this was an error in the manuscript, and thought it originally said Assos was a colony of Methymna. ===Classical Period=== Methymna had a long- standing rivalry with Mytilene, and during the Peloponnesian War it sided with Athens during the Mytilenaean revolt in 428 BCE when all the other cities of Lesbos sided with Mytilene.Thucydides 3.2.1, 3.5.1. When the Athenians put down the revolt the following year, only Methymna was spared from having its territory turned into a cleruchy.Thucydides 3.50.2, Diodorus Siculus 12.55.10. After 427, Methymna and Chios were the only members of the Delian League to remain self-governing and exempt from tribute, indicating the privileged position Methymna held within the Athenian Empire.Thucydides 6.85.2, 7.57.5, 8.100.5. Methymna was briefly captured by the Spartans in summer 412, before quickly being retaken by the Athenians: in describing this episode, the historian Thucydides indicates that the Methymnaeans were much more inclined to side with Athens than Sparta.Thucydides 8.23.4-6. This was likewise the case in 411, when a group of Methymnaeans who were in exile at Cyme in Aeolis attempted to return to Methymna by force, but were rebuffed by the population.Thucydides 8.100.2-3. When the Spartan commander Kallikratidas besieged Methymna in 406, the city stayed loyal to its Athenian garrison and held out until it was betrayed by several traitors.Xenophon, Hellenica 1.6.12-15, Diodorus Siculus 13.76.5-6. Our knowledge of the history of Methymna in the 4th century is limited, but its prominence as a polis is firmly attested by the city's silver and bronze coinage. By at least the 340s BCE, the tyrant Kleommis had expelled the city's democrats and remained in power for the next decade.Isocrates, Epistles 7.8-9 (ca. 346/5?), Theopompus FGrHist 115 F 227 = Athenaeus 10.442f-443a, IG II2 284 + Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 54.132. We do not know what happened to Kleommis after this, although it is likely that he was expelled when the island fell to Philip II's generals Parmenion and Attalus in 336.P. J. Rhodes and R. Osborne, Greek Historical Inscriptions, 404–323 BC (2003) 416–17. The political history of the following four years are poorly attested: we know that Lesbos changed hands several times between the Macedonian forces of Alexander the Great and the Persian forces of Memnon of Rhodes, that Memnon captured Methymna in 333 BCE, and that when Alexander's admiral Hegelochus recaptured Methymna in 332 BCE its tyrant was Aristonicus not Kleommis.Diodorus Siculus 17.29.2, Arrian, Anabasis 3.2.4. However, it is not clear whether Aristonicus was made tyrant when the Persians recaptured Methymna in 335, or whether Kleommis was re- installed and Aristonicus only made tyrant in 333. Whatever the case, in 332 Alexander gave Aristonicus over to the newly restored Methymnaean democracy to try, and he was found guilty and put to death by torture.Capture at Chios: Arrian, Anabasis 3.2.4, Curtius 4.5.19. Execution: Curtius 4.8.11. ===Hellenistic Period=== In c. 295 BCE, Methymna struck silver drachms for King Lysimachus, indicating that the city was part of his kingdom at this time.Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum Kayhan 4. However, by the 250s BCE at the latest, Methymna had come under the sway of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. P. Brun, 'Les Lagides à Lesbos: essai de chronologie' Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 85 (1991) 99-113 has suggested an earlier date in the 270s, but this has not been accepted by scholars: Ph. Gauthier, Bulletin épigraphique (1992) no. 343. During this period, a festival in honour of the Ptolemies, the Ptolemaia, was instituted, and public documents produced by the city were dated by the regnal years of the Ptolemies.IG XII (2) 498 (ca. 221-205). Worship of Sarapis, an Egyptian cult patronized by the Ptolemies, was probably introduced to Methymna at this period, and remained an important part of the city's life for several centuries.List of Sarapiastai: IG XII (2) 511 (1st century BC). In the 2nd century BCE Methymna increasingly pursued a policy of seeking closer ties with the emerging power of Rome. Methymna remained loyal to Rome during the Macedonian War, and in 167 BCE it was rewarded when the Romans punished neighbouring Antissa for disloyalty and transferred its territory to Methymna.Livy 45.31.13-14, Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis 5.139, H. J. Mason, 'The end of Antissa' American Journal of Philology 116.3 (1995) 399-410. The territory of Methymna was ravaged by King Prusias II of Bithynia along with several other cities in this region in ca. 156 BCE, but the Romans later compelled Prusias to pay reparations of 100 talents for the damage done.Polybius 33.13.8. In 129 BCE, an inscription from Methymna shows that the city formed a formal alliance with Rome.IG XII (2) 510. A dedication to the Galatian princess Adobogiona (fl. c. 80 - 50 BCE), who was the mistress of Mithridates VI of Pontus, a long-standing enemy of Rome, may indicate a cooling of relations between Methymna or Rome or simply political expediency.IG XII (2) 516. ===Roman Period=== Methymna gained a particular reputation among Romans for viticulture during the Imperial period. Virgil speaks of the vines of Methymna as the best and most numerous on Lesbos, while Ovid invokes them as an example of something which is proverbially numerous and bountiful.Virgil, Georgics 2.89-90, Ovid, Ars Amatoria 1.57-9. The distinctive strong taste of Methymnaean wine is mentioned by Silius Italicus, and Propertius uses this as a point of reference when describing another Greek wine.Silius Italicus, Punica 7.209-11, Propertius 4.8.38. When Virgil and Silius wished to indicate the exceptional quality of Phalernian wine, Methymnaean wine is among the vintages which they say it surpasses.Virgil, Georgics 2.89ff, Silius Italicus, Punica 7.209-11. We also learn from Horace that Methymnaean grapes were equally prized for the excellent vinegar which could be produced from them and which he describes accompanying a sumptuous eel dish.Horace, Satires 2.8.49-50. The medical writer Galen, who was a native of nearby Pergamon, considered all the wines of Lesbos to be excellent, but ranked that of Methymna the first in quality, that of Eresos second, and that of Mytilene third.Galen 10.832, 13.405, 13.659 Kühn. At 14.28-29 Kühn he instead places Eresian wine above that of Methymna. In the novel Daphnis and Chloe, thought to be by the Mytilenaean aristocrat Longus and set in the region of Lesbos between Methymna and Mytilene, the vine harvest is the most important time of the agricultural year, and the Mytilenaean owner of the land in this region times his annual visit to coincide with the end of this harvest when the year's profit can be established.Longus, Daphnis and Chloe. ===Byzantine Period=== View of a street The first attested bishop of Methymna was Christodoros in 520 CE.Patrologia Latina 63 cols. 483-5, A. Kaldellis and S. Efthymiadis, The Prosopography of Byzantine Lesbos 284-1355 AD (2010) no. 10. In 640, Methymna was mentioned in the Ecthesis, pseudographically attributed to Epiphanius of Salamis, as an autocephalous archdiocese, and around 1084, it was made a metropolitan see under Alexius I Comnenus. The Fourth Crusade brought Latin control, on the strength of which the Roman Catholic Church maintains a purely titular see of Methymna; there were 40 Roman Catholics in 1908. In 840 the city was plundered by Cretan Arabs and many of the inhabitants sold into slavery. E. Malamut, Les îles de l'Empire byzantin: VIIIe-XIIe siècles (1988) 101. The fortifications of Methymna were strengthened following this attack, and again at the end of the 11th century, as we learn from a building inscription dating to 1084/5.A. Conze, Reise auf der Insel Lesbos (1865) 21-4. A few years later in 1089/90 these fortifications helped the inhabitants of Methymna successfully repel an attack by Emir Tzachas of Smyrna.Anna Komnena, Alexiad, vol. 2, p. 110f. These fortifications again kept Methymna safe when the Genoese Lord of Phokaia, Domenico Cattaneo, seized the rest of Lesbos in 1335, but was unable to take Methymna or the equally well-fortified town of Eresos.Tabula Imperii Byzantini 10 s.v. Methymna, p. 229. Along with the rest of Lesbos, Methymna became a possession of the Gattelusi family in 1355. Methymna repelled an Ottoman invasion force in 1450, but its defences were over-powered in a second invasion in 1458 when the admiral Ismaelos seize the city with a force of 150 ships.Tabula Imperii Byzantini 10 s.v. Methymna, p. 229. Using Methymna as a base, the whole island was gradually brought under Ottoman control by September 1462. ===Ottoman Period=== As Molova under the Ottoman Empire, the city was a kaza of the sanjak of Metelin in the vilayet of Rhodes. ===Modern Period=== After the defeat of the Ottomans in the First Balkan War (1912), the Greek navy liberated and incorporated Lesbos in the Greek Kingdom. ==Province== The province of Mithymna () was one of the provinces of the Lesbos Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipal units Mithymna, Agia Paraskevi, Eresos-Antissa, Kalloni and Petra. It was abolished in 2006. ==Historical population== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- ! Year !! Village population !!

In 1858, Begbie became the first Chief Justice of the Crown Colony of British Columbia in colonial times and in the first decades after British Columbia joined Confederation as a province of Canada. Begbie served as the first Judge of the Supreme Court, Colony of British Columbia 1858 to 1866 and then, in the same capacity in the Supreme Court, the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia from 1866 to 1870. He was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Colonies from 1870 to 1871 and then served as the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the new Province of British Columbia from 1871 until his death on June 11, 1894. In the years after his death, Begbie came to be known as the Hanging Judge. ==Early life and education== The son of an Army Colonel, Begbie was born on a British ship en route to the island of Mauritius, where he lived until he was seven, returning with his parents to Great Britain where he pursued his education. From the age of eleven to seventeen he was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey where he held the school number 328. His brother Thomas Stirling Begbie (329) attended the school at the same time. Begbie received his first degree from Peterhouse at the University of Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and the classics. He was involved in a great number of extracurricular activities, including singing and acting in amateur productions, dining societies, playing chess, rowing, and tennis. After Cambridge, Begbie went on to study law at Lincoln's Inn. He established a successful law practice in London before heading to British Columbia for a new position in government. ==Career== Begbie reached Fort Victoria on November 16, 1858. He was sworn into office in Fort Langley on November 19, as the new Colony of British Columbia was proclaimed. Given the influx of prospectors and others during Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and the following Cariboo Gold Rush of 1861, Begbie played a crucial role in the establishment of law and order throughout the new colony. Begbie was made a Knight Bachelor according to the London Gazette of November 19, 1875. During his years on the bench, Begbie traveled throughout British Columbia, on foot and later on horseback administering justice in sometimes informal circumstances but he is said to have always worn his judicial robes and wig when court was in session. During his early years, he played a role in government including drafting legislation such as the Aliens Act (1859), the Gold Fields Act (1859), and the Pre-emption Act (1860). In 1860, Begbie found a white Californian man by the name of William Marshall guilty of assaulting a First Nations man based only on the testimony of First Nations people, the first time this had ever occurred. Begbie learned a number of Indigenous dialects and even conducted trials in those languages without the use of an interpreter. He had great friendships with a number of chiefs and he was clearly sympathetic when it came to trying to impose colonial law on Indigenous people. He recognized the concept of Aboriginal marriage and allowed an oath for truth telling that recognized Aboriginal beliefs. Begbie, a 19th-century Scotsman (born in colonial Mauritius), truly believed in the Scottish Enlightenment values of egalitarianism when it came to understanding and interacting with Aboriginal peoples. He allowed people of other cultures to swear an oath of truth on an object sacred to them in place of the Bible. In 1864, Begbie presided over the murder trial of five Tsilhqot'in men who were part of the Chilcotin War. The five were found guilty by juries and sentenced to hang. Begbie did not pass judgment himself but he did pronounce the mandatory sentence as the law required him to do. In 2014, the British Columbia government exonerated the Chilcotin leaders. Premier Christy Clark stated, \\"We confirm without reservation that these six Tsilhqot'in chiefs are fully exonerated for any crime or wrongdoing.\\" He was also an active naturalist. He was known to record observations during his travel, including drawing maps and bridge construction drawings. He sang opera. Begbie was implicated in land dealings at Cottonwood, between Quesnel and Barkerville, but denied any wrongdoing in what became known as the Cottonwood Scandal. Begbie continued his judicial duties well into his last illness, dying in Victoria, British Columbia on June 11, 1894. The funeral procession marking his death is said to have been unprecedented and intended to mark the passing of a man regarded as British Columbia's first citizen. Begbie was interred at Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia. ===The Hanging Judge=== \\"The Hanging Judge\\" is a term that has been referred to Begbie, though never in his lifetime. ==Legacy== Begbie ruled in 1886 that a law imposing very high licence fees discriminated against Chinese people even though it did not mention them, because laundries at the time were overwhelmingly run by Chinese. Another ruling with a similar logic two years later compelled the city of Victoria to renew the licences of Chinese pawnbrokers. Mt. Begbie (left) A Vancouver school, Sir Matthew Begbie Elementary School, was also named in his honour. Mount Begbie, the most prominent mountain seen from Revelstoke, was named in his honor. There are two other Mount Begbies in British Columbia; they are little more than hills although the one in the marshlands south of 100 Mile House has also given its name to the Begbie Summit, the highest point on the Cariboo Highway. There are also two lakes and a creek named for Judge Begbie. There are several statues located throughout Vancouver, one outside the Law Society of British Columbia and one outside the Law Courts at New Westminster, British Columbia. The statue outside the Law Society of British Columbia will be removed after the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. (The family name Begbie originates in south-east Scotland, where it is most common in the Edinburgh and East Lothian areas. Begbie is derived from the Old Norse personal name Baggi + Old Norse býr 'settlement'. The small hamlet of Begbie, [55° 55'42.00\\"N 2°48'55.00\\"W], can be found adjacent to the larger hamlet of Samuelston, near to the town of Haddington, East Lothian). == Image gallery == Image:Matthew begbie 1.jpg|Tombstone at Ross Bay Cemetery Image:Matthew begbie 2.jpg|Epitaph Image:Matthew begbie 3.jpg|Historical Marker at Bastion Square Image:Statue of Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie.jpg|Statue formerly displayed at the Law Society of British Columbia Building, Hornby Street, Vancouver BC, by Ralph Sketch.

Situated approximately from Medina, Fadak was known for its water wells, dates, and handicrafts.Veccia Vaglieri, L. \\"Fadak.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman; Th. Bianquis; C. E. Bosworth; E. van Donzel; and W. P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. University of Toronto. 8 August 2010 When the Muslims defeated the people of Khaybar at the Battle of Khaybar; the oasis of Fadak was part of the bounty given to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Fadak is said to have become the object of dispute by a group of Muslims between Fatimah and the caliph Abu Bakr after Muhammad died. == History  Pre-Islamic Khaybar === In the 7th century, the Khaybar oasis was inhabited by Arab Jews, who made their living growing date palm trees. Some objects found by the Muslims in a redoubt at Khaybar – a siege-engine, 20 bales of Yemenite cloth, and 500 cloaks – point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews.Veccia Vaglieri, L. \\"Khaybar\\". Encyclopaedia of Islam Online. Ed. P.J. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Academic Publishers. ISSN 1573-3912 The oasis was divided into three regions: al-Natat, al-Shiqq الشِّق, and al- Katiba الكتيبة, probably separated by natural diversions, such as the desert, lava drifts, and swamps. Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts containing homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a clan and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the fortresses were raised up on hills or basalt rocks. === Muhammad's era (629-632 CE) === Muhammad quietly led the march on Khaybar oasis on 7 May AH/ 629 CE with approximately 1500 men and 100–200 horses. Primary sources including the Sirah Rasul Allah (Biography of the Prophet) of Ibn Ishaq describe the conquest of Khaybar, detailing the agreement of Muhammad with the Jews to remain in Fadak and cultivate their land, retaining one-half of the produce of the oasis.Sirat Rasulullah, Chapter 'Khaybar' This agreement was distinct from the agreement with the Jews of Khaybar, which essentially entailed the practice of sharecropping. Muhammad retained the revenues of the Fadak region for the poor as ṣadaqa, travelers in need, and for his family. It is not entirely clear how Muhammad managed his possession of Fadak. Ibn Taimiyya wrote in his Minhaj al-Sunnah that Muhammad appointed Amr ibn al-As as the governor of the Khaybar oasisMinhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah by Ibn Taimiyya, volume 4-page 460 Following the death of Muhammad, scholars disagreed as to whether Fadak was exclusively his property. Some Muslim commentators agree that following the conquest of Fadak, the property belonged exclusively to Muhammad, while several others reject this view.A Shah Waliullah in Quratul Ain p228 and Ibn Taymiyyah in Minhaj al- Sunnah, Dhikr of Fadak Various primary sources describe the acquisition of Fadak in the following way: > Half the Land of Fadak, which was given by Jews after the peace treaty, was > purely the property of Rasool Allah (s). Similarly, 1/3rd of the Valley of > Qari and 2 castles of Khaybar were the exclusive property of Muhammad (s) > and no one else had a share of it.Al Minhaj bi Sharh Sahih Muslim Volume 2, > 92. > The Apostle of Allah received three things exclusively to himself: Banu an- > Nadir, Khaybar and Fadak. The Banu an-Nadir property was kept for his > emergent needs, Fadak for travellers, and Khaybar was divided by the Apostle > of Allah into three sections: two for Muslims, and one as a contribution for > his family. If anything remained after making the contribution of his > family, he divided it among the poor Emigrants.Sunan Abi Dawood Book 19, > Number 2961 Another primary account describes eleven fruit trees in Fadak, planted by Muhammad himself.Sharh Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed, v4, p108 Other scholars who accept the view of Fadak as belonging exclusively to Muhammad after the conquest of Khaybar include: *Ali bn Ahmad al-SamhudiWafa al-Wafa, v4, p1280 *Ibn HishamSirah Rasul Allah by Ibn Hisham, v3, p353 *Abu al-FidaThe Concise History of Humanity or Chronicles, p140, Dhikr Ghazwa Khaybar === Fatimah (Shia View)=== Upon the death of Muhmmad, his daughter Fatimah declared her claim to inherit Fadak as the estate of her father. The claim was rejected by the ruling caliph, Abu Bakr, on the grounds that Fadak was public property and arguing that Muhammad had no heirs. Sources report that Ali together with Umm Ayman (Barakah) testified to the fact that Muhammad granted it to Fatimah Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested Fatima to summon witnesses for her claim.* Ordoni (1990) p. 211 Various primary sources contend that Fadak was gifted by Muhammad to Fatima, drawing on the Qur'an as evidence.Q Al-Hashr, 7 These include narrations of Ibn 'Abbas who argued that when the Qur'anic verse on giving rights to kindred was revealed, Muhammad called to his daughter and gifted the land of Fadak to her.Dur al-Manthur Vol. 4, page 177 Various scholars commenting on the Qur'an, Chapter Al-Hashr, verse 7, write that the Angel Gabriel came to Muhammad and commanded him to give the appropriate rights to the \\"Dhul Qurba\\" (near kin). When asked by Muhammad, who the \\"Dhul Qurba\\" referred to, Gabriel replied \\"Fatima\\" and that by \\"rights\\" was meant \\"Fadak\\", upon which Muhammad called Fatima and presented Fadak to her.*Ruzatul Safa as quoted in Tashdheed-ul-Mathaeen page 102. Besides the above Quranic verses, there some authenticated references for this issue. For example, Ali Ibn Burhanu'd-din Halabi Shafi'i writes in his Siratu'l-Halabiyya, p. 39 that at first Fatimah complained to Abu Bakr about the fact that she was given the fadak as a gift by the prophet of Islam, as the witnesses were unavailable she was forced to allege her right based on the inheritance law. Also it is mentioned in Mu'jam Al-Buldan of Yaqut al-Hamawi, Tafsir al-Kabir of Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi, Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa of Ibn Hajar p. 21, Sharh al- Nahju'l-Balagha of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali Vol 4, p. 80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would not talk to Abu Bakr and Umar again.Peshawar Nights, Sultan al-Wa’adhim As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Musawi ash- Shirazi === After the death of Muhammad === Lesley Hazleton describes the dispute between Fatimah and Abu Bakr as follows: \\"[Fatimah] sent a message to Abu Bakr asking for her share of her father's estate -date palm orchards in the huge oases of Khaybar and Fadak to the north of Medina. His response left her dumbfounded. Muhammad's estate belonged to the community, not to any individual, Abu Bakr replied. It was part of the Muslim charitable trust to be administered by him as Caliph. [...] There was no denying the populist appeal of the message Abu Bakr sent by denying Fatima's claim: the House of Muhammad was the House of Islam, and all were equal within it.\\"After the Prophet: The Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split in Islam By Lesley Hazleton, pp. 71-73 When Umar became Caliph, the value of the land of Fadak along with its dates was 50,000 dirhams. Ali again claimed Fatima's inheritance during Umar's era, but was denied with the same argument as in the time of Abu Bakr. Umar however, restored the estates in Medina to 'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib and Ali, as representatives of Muhammad's clan, the Banu Hashim. During Uthman's caliphate, Marwan ibn al-Hakâm, who was his cousin, was made trustee of the Fadak.Wafa al Wafa (vol 3 p 1000), Tarikh Abu al-Fida (vol 1 p 168) === Sunni view of Fadak === According to Sunnis, Fadak was a piece of land, near Khaiber, where Jews lived. Fadak was conquered by Muhammad. The Qur'an says: \\"And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal. -(59: 6-7). Thus according to the Qur’an, Fai means such of properties of the unbelievers as are returned to the Muslims without war. It is not to be distributed like booty among the soldiers, but the whole of it is for Allah and His apostle. From the Sunnah and Practice of the Prophet of Islam it is evident that Muhammad himself used to manage Fai as the head of the Islamic republic.http://www.muslimtents.com/shaufi/b16/b16_13.htm According to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter. All the narrations regarding this are weak. As far as the claim of Shias is concerned, that when the verse of the Quran, \\"And give the relative his right\\",Quran, Surah Isra, verse 26 was revealed, the Prophet gave Fadak to his daughter as it was her right. But, there are several famous Sunni scholars who specify that the revelation of 17:2617:26 is about Fadak transmission from the Prophet to Fatima, such as: Razi,[Razi in the book \\"Aljrh and Altdyl\\" vol. 1, p. 257] Suyuti,[Suyuti (Vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 5, pp.273_274)] Khwarizmi, Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi[Ali ibn Abd-al-Malik al-Hindi (vol. 2, p. 158 and vol. 3, p. 767)] and so on. Nevertheless, it is reported that Umme Hani said that Fatimah said that Abu Bakr told her that the Prophet said \\"We Prophets do not have inheritors, instead what we leave is Charity for the Ummah\\".Darqutni,Al ilal ,1:231:34 === Fadak under the Umayyads (661 - 750) === Mu'awiyah, the first Umayyad Caliph did not return Fadak to Fatimah's descendants. This way was continued by later Umayyad Caliphs until Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz seized power. When Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, known as Umar II, became Caliph in 717 CE, the income from the property of Fadak was 40,000 dinars.Sunan Abu Dawud, v3, p144, Dhikr Fa'y Fadak was returned to Fatima's descendants by an edict given by Umar II,Wafa al-Wafa, page 99 but this decision was renounced by later caliphs.Umar II's successor, Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik (known as Yazid II) overturned his decision, and Fadak was again made public trust. Fadak was then managed this way until the Ummayad Caliphate expired. === Fadak under the Abbasids (750 - 1258) === In year 747 CE, a huge revolt against the Umayyad Caliphate occurred. The Umayyad's were eventually defeated by the Abbasid army under the rule of Abu Abbas Abdullah al-Saffah (see Battle of the Zab) in year 750. The last Umayyad Caliph, Marwan II, was killed in a lesser battle a few months after the Battle of the Zab, thus ending the Umayyad Caliphate. Historical accounts differs on what happened to Fadak under the early Abbasid caliphs. There is however consensus among Islamic scholars that Fadak was granted to the descendants of Fatimah during Al-Ma'mun's reign as Caliph (831-833 CE). Al-Ma’mun even decreed this to be recorded in his (dīwāns). Al- Ma’mun's successor, Al-Mutawakkil (847-861) recaptured Fadak from the progeny of Fatimah, decreeing it to be used for the purposes initially outlined by Abu Bakr. Al-Muntasir (861-862), however, apparently maintained the decision of Al-Ma'mun, thus allowing Fatimah's progeny to manage Fadak.As stated in Tarikh Yaqubi (2:199, 3:48), Wafa al Wafa vol 3 pp. 999–1000, Tarikh ul Khulafa, pp. 231–32 What happened hereafter is uncertain, but Fadak was probably seized by the Caliph again and managed exclusively by the ruler of the time as his private property. ==Fadak in literature== The dispute over Fadak was narrated in various sources, some of which became almost legendary. Among these is the tale of the famed caliph of the One thousand and one Nights tales, Harun al Rashid, narrated in the 16th-century work Laṭā’if al-Tawā’if The Subtleties of People, in which Harun is described as feeling regret over the denial of Fadak to Muhammad's family. Harun inquired about the boundaries of the oasis from a descendant of Fatima in order to return it to its rightful possessors. The descendant cautioned that after drawing the borders of the garden of Fadak, Harun would no longer want to relinquish it. Nevertheless, Harun pressed on. The descendant replied that the first boundary of Fadak was Aden, the second Samarqand, the third the Maghrib, and the fourth the Armenian Sea. These borders outlined virtually the entire empire of Harun. That Harun himself initiated the process of returning Fadak and was not pressed by Muhammad's descendants reveals that in the Shi’i conception, worldly possessions are of little to no importance to Muhammad's family or to the authority of the Imams.Virani, Shafique N.

His father and uncles, were slaveholders who were compensated for their slaves upon the emancipation of slavery in the 1830s.CJ Coventry, \\"Links in the Chain: British slavery, Victoria and South Australia\\" Before/Now 1(1) (2019), p. 35, https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:23672/datastreams/CONTENT/content ==British North America== After ten years of colonial service in the Caribbean, Musgrave was appointed governor of Newfoundland in September, 1864. Unlike his previous appointments, Newfoundland had responsible government and an active colonial assembly. He also found a colony in dire economic straits, containing a destitute population. During his tenure, Musgrave dedicated most of energies towards convincing Newfoundland to remedy this by joining the negotiations with other British North American colonies towards union in what would become the Canadian Confederation. In this project, he was allied with the goals of the colonial office. Despite his efforts, and what seemed like imminent success, Musgrave ultimately failed to move the colonial assembly to accepting terms of union. Canada was proclaimed on 1 July 1867--and Newfoundland would not join Confederation for eighty years. right In consultation with the colonial office and the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, it was agreed that Musgrave should redirect his energies concerning the expansion of the Canadian confederation away from the easternmost colony of British North America, to the westernmost--the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia. Following the death of Frederick Seymour, Musgrave took up his new responsibilities as colonial governor in August, 1869. Musgrave found a colony in an administrative and financial mess, with a fractious assembly, long-simmering disputes between the two colonies and their capitals – Victoria and New Westminster--and general frustration with the slow pace of negotiations for the colony to enter confederation. Musgrave proved to be both a capable administrator, and an able placater of the assembly's notoriously contentious members. In less than two years, in July, 1871, British Columbia joined Canada as its sixth province. ==Natal== Musgrave did a brief stint as governor of the South African colony of Natal. ==South Australia== right Musgrave's next posting was to South Australia. This proved to be a substantially less taxing appointment. During his tenure, Musgrave supported the assembly in its plans to borrow a large sum for the purpose of extensive railway construction, the imposition of additional taxation, and the introduction of a considerable number of immigrants into what was still a largely unsettled hinterland. ==Jamaica== After three and a half years in the antipodes, Musgrave returned to the Caribbean as governor of Jamaica. He would govern the colony for the next six years, focusing much of his attention on improving its cultural life. Under his administration, the government purchased Jamaica Railway Company and extended the line. Musgrave also initiated the Jamaica Scholarship, and was instrumental in establishing the Institute of Jamaica, dedicated to fostering and encouraging the development of arts, science, and literature. The Musgrave Medal, awarded by the institute for excellence in these fields, was named in his honour in 1897. ==Queensland== Burial site of Sir Anthony Musgrave at Toowong Cemetery. Musgrave's last appointment was back in Australia, as governor of the colony of Queensland, where he arrived on 7 November 1883 in the Ranelagh. Like South Australia, Queensland enjoyed full responsible government, and Musgrave was more of a spectator of the political scene. He travelled with premier Samuel Griffith to visit the northern parts of the colony including Cooktown, Port Douglas, Cairns, Townsville, Charters Towers, Mourilyan Harbour, Cardwell, and Bowen. During this period, he was faced with responding to the action of the colony's premier, Sir Thomas McIlwraith, in \\"annexing\\" New Guinea as part of Queensland — an action repudiated by the colonial office. Governor Anthony Musgrave was at the point of retiring from the colonial service when he died at his desk in Brisbane on 9 October 1888 from strangulation of the bowel. His funeral was held on 10 October 1888 at St John's Cathedral, after which he was interred in Brisbane's Toowong General Cemetery on the principal slope near to the grave of Governor Blackall, the location being personally selected by premier Thomas McIlwraith. In May 1939, his grave was reported as unkempt and overgrown with weeds. ==Family== He married in 1854 to Christiana Elizabeth, daughter of the Hon. Sir William Byam of Antigua (she died in 1859). During his tenure in British Columbia, Musgrave married his second wife, Jeanie Lucinda Field who was the daughter of David Dudley Field. Their daughter, Joyce, died in South Australia during 1874. According to article in \\"Air Clues\\" May 1995, he also had three sons: Arthur David Musgrave b.1874 d.1931 (Served in the Army, ending the war as CRA 52nd Division, retiring as a Brigadier General), Herbert Musgrave DSO RFC and RE, b.11 May 1876 in Adelaide, S.Australia, d.2 June 1918 in German territory and Dudley Field Musgrave b.1873 d.1895 of Typhoid Fever in Bombay (Served in the Royal Navy reaching Lieutenant).The National Archives of the UK; Kew, Surrey, England; Admiralty and predecessors: Office of the Director General of the Medical Department of the Navy and predecessors: Service Registers and Registers of Deaths and Injuries.

It is located at latitude 36° 57' N, longitude 3° 21' W, at 1,350 metres above sea level. Its postal code is 18412. Together with Capileira (to the north) and Pampaneira (to the south) it has become a focus for the tourist trade in La Alpujarra, because of the spectacular location of the three villages on the gorge of the Río Poqueira and below the peaks of the Sierra Nevada. The three villages, with their characteristic Moorish features - narrow, winding streets, flat roofs - have been designated as a Conjunto Histórico Artístico, a region of special artistic and historical importance. Bubión is thought to have been founded in Roman times, and in any case it certainly antedates the Moorish invasion of the 7th century. Under the Moors, it was under the authority of Ugíjar. In the 16th century, after the fall of Granada to the \\"Catholic Monarchs\\", the village participated in the rebellions by the Moors (or \\"Moriscos\\" - Moors supposed to have been converted to Christianity). In the second rebellion, which started in December 1568, Bubión was one of the first villages of the Alpujarra to fall to the Catholic forces, after a major battle in the Poqueira valley. Following their defeat in 1571, almost all Moriscos were expelled from the province of Granada. They were partially replaced by Christian settlers from other parts of Spain. In the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39, Bubión and the other two villages of the Poqueira valley remained under Nationalist control, although Republican forces held the surrounding heights. The most prominent building is the village church, built in the 16th century and remodelled in the following century. It is a simple structure in the mudéjar style. In the census of 2001 Bubión's population was given as 610, consisting of 357 \\"residents\\" and 253 \\"non-residents\\" (i.e. with a home elsewhere). A substantial number of both categories did not hold Spanish nationality, the majority of them coming from other states of the European Union. The village had 170 tourist beds. The GR 7/E4 European long- distance footpath runs through Bubión. In addition a network of walking trails link the three white villages and the Poqueira Gorge, ascending into the Sierra Nevada mountains and providing an approach to Mulhacén, the highest peak in continental Spain. Bubión is served by a bus route from the city of Granada through Órgiva, continuing up the Poqueira valley to Capileira; then on through Trevelez and some further villages. There are three buses a day in each direction by Alsina Graells plus an extra bus to Orgiva on market Thursday at 9am.

He was a qualified physician and headed the Mafia family from the town of Corleone in Sicily. He was known as 'u patri nostru (our father). ==Early career== Navarra was born in the Sicilian town of Corleone in a middle class family; his father was a small landowner, a land surveyor and teacher at the local agrarian school. His uncle from his mother’s side, Angelo Gagliano, had been a member of the Fratuzzi, as the local Mafia was known at the time and which consisted mainly of gabellotti, local power brokers that leased large estates from absentee landlords, and subleased plots to peasants at excessive or abusive rates. He was killed in 1930.«Fratuzzi», antenati di Liggio e Riina, La Sicilia, August 8, 2004 Navarra studied at the University of Palermo, first engineering and later medicine, getting his degree in 1929. He served in the Royal Italian Army until 1942, reaching the rank of captain. He became the boss of Corleone in 1943, succeeding Calogero Lo Bue. Navarra was the old fashioned type of Mafia boss: genteel, well dressed, but ferocious. He did not murder people himself, but delegated the work. From 1944-48, when he took over command of the Mafia in town, there had been 57 murders in Corleone.Servadio, Mafioso, pp. 167-68 By skilful manipulation of the Mafia network of mutual aid and graft, he occupied several key positions in the establishment of Corleone, had powerful political connections and enjoyed a high status.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 45Lewis, The Honoured Society, p. 103 He became the official medical adviser to the Ferrovie dello Stato (Italian State Railways), which was offered to him when, in public competition, he was the only candidate. ==Rising power== Following the Allied invasion of Sicily in World War II (Operation Husky) in 1943, the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) granted Navarra the right to collect the military vehicles abandoned by the Italian army. Navarra used these to start a trucking company, which was vital to some of his operations involving the theft of livestock. In 1946 Navarra became the top doctor at the hospital in Corleone after his predecessor, Dr. Nicolosi, was conveniently murdered.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 333 A new large modern hospital in Corleone stood empty from 1952 to 1958 and was only put into service after the death of Navarra, the director of the old one.Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, p. 65 Navarra used his positions as director of the hospital to increase his power. In Corleone, people still talk of the blind electors of Navarra: On election day hundreds of men and women were struck blind; they pretended to have lost their sight. He issued certificates to the effect that they were blind or short-sighted and therefore had to be assisted in the act of voting in order to enable Navarra’s men to accompany them into the polling booth and check their ballot.Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, pp. 157-58 For a while Navarra sympathized with the Sicilian separatist movement, but he soon joined the Christian Democrat party in 1948. ==Rizzotto murder== Under the tutelage of Navarra, the young and upcoming Mafioso Luciano Leggio got his start, first in cattle rustling and clandestine butchering, and subsequently as estate guard (campiere), before becoming a lease holder (gabelloto) of the estate at the age of 20, the youngest ever.Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 59-60 When Leggio murdered the Socialist trade union leader Placido Rizzotto in March 1948, Navarra made sure to dispose of the only witness, Giuseppe Letizia, an 11-year-old shepherd. His father took the shocked boy to the hospital run by Navarra. The boy talked about the murder but died after an injection. Navarra was blamed by the press for killing the boy and thus eliminating a witness. Navarra was arrested for his involvement in the murder, but not convicted. He was sent into compulsory internal exile in Gioiosa Ionica, province of Reggio Calabria, for five years. However, thanks to his contacts with friendly politicians, he returned to Corleone in 1949. In Calabria he established close relationships with the charismatic 'Ndrangheta boss Antonio Macrì. E ora la ’ndrangheta supera cosa nostra: Intervista a Enzo Ciconte, Polizia e democrazia, November–December 2007 ==Conflict with Leggio== Meanwhile his former underling Leggio developed his own rackets, independently from Navarra – transport, smuggling stolen cattle and selling the meat on Palermo’s wholesale market. From 1953-1958 Corleone recorded 153 Mafia related murders. Conflicts of interest between Navarra and Leggio also arose over to a plan to dam the Belice river at the Piano della Scala near Corleone. Those who controlled the water supply throughout the neighbourhood of Corleone resented the plan. Springs in Sicily are private property and their exploitation, yielding large profits, is traditionally associated with Mafia power. Navarra represented the vested interests of those opposed to the dam, while Leggio favoured the construction of the dam. He expected to gain a monopoly of haulage work in connection with its construction.Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, pp. 63-65 Navarra tried to have Leggio killed in June 1958. Leggio was invited by Navarra to meet him at an estate but instead he found fifteen armed men there. The hitmen hired for the task did a poor job and Leggio escaped with just minor injuries. The event left Leggio and his followers with the knowledge that they were as good as dead if they did not strike back soon. The bullet ridden Fiat of Navarra ==Death== A few weeks later, on 2 August 1958, Navarra and a fellow doctor (Giovanni Russo, who had nothing to do with criminal activities) were both shot to death on an isolated country road as they drove home in Navarra's Fiat 1100. The car was blocked on the open road by two other vehicles and riddled by submachine-gun bullets. A few weeks later, on September 6, three men known as friends of Navarra were killed in a raid at Corleone. Reciprocal killings went on until 1963 and Leggio had to disappear having been condemned for the killing of Navarra. http://archiviopiolatorre.camera.it/img- repo/DOCUMENTAZIONE/Antimafia/01_rel_p03_2.pdf Leggio thus became the boss of the Corleone Mafia. Among Navarra's suspected killers were Bernardo Provenzano and Salvatore \\"Totò\\" Riina.Profile: Bernardo Provenzano, BBC News, April 11, 2006 Riina became the leading Mafioso in 1974 after Leggio was captured and sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder. His Corleonesi would continue to take over the Sicilian Mafia in the Second Mafia War in the 1980s. Navarra was the kind of Mafioso who was more interested in power than money. He left his widow a few plots of land and part of a house. The Antimafia Commission remarked that “the small size of his estate shows that Navarra has always aimed at power, rather than at money for its own sake … He often spent more than he brought in, both in his medical activities and in his career as Mafioso.”Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 53 ==ReferencesSources== *Arlacchi, Pino (1988).

The moth sometimes flies during the day but mainly at night, and is attracted to light. The larva is brown or green with a \\"horn\\" on its back and feeds on a variety of trees and shrubs. Recorded food plants include apple, birch, blackthorn, currant, hawthorn, Prunus, rowan, Amelanchier and willow. The species, due to its complex life cycle, overwinters either as a larva or a pupa. ==Life cycle== The species has a complex ecology: sometimes one brood is produced each year but sometimes three broods are produced over a two-year period, with the result that adults can be seen on the wing at any time from April to October . ==Distribution== The brimstone is found throughout the Palearctic region and Western Asia. ==Early research== The English zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton, author of The Colours of Animals (1890) described countershading in insects including the caterpillar larvae of the brimstone moth. The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, generally considered the originator of the theory of countershading, credited Poulton with its partial discovery. ==Gallery== File:Opisthograptis_luteolata.jpg|Underside File:Opisthograptis luteolata 9163.jpg|Caterpillar File:Opisthograptis luteolata - pupating A - 01 - beginning its cocoon.jpg|Pupating File:Opisthograptis luteolata - pupating A - 03 - cocoon done.jpg|Cocoon File:Opisthograptis luteolata Meyers.jpg|Illustration from the Meyers Blitz- Lexikon, 1932 File:Brimstone Moth larva as twig mimic Poulton 1890 (detail).jpg|Figure of larva as twig mimicPoulton, EB (1890).

Nanette Newman, who appeared in the 1980s TV advertisements returned for a new campaign to promote the launch. ==Other products== In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Fairy is also a longstanding brand of non-biological laundry detergent, the original soap- based variant being known as \\"Fairy Snow\\". In recent years, Fairy Non-Bio also have added fabric conditioner to their product range. Like Fairy dish detergent, its traditional trademark is a walking baby. Fairy was also a brand of soap in those countries, characteristically green in colour and available both in the form of larger rectangular 155g blocks for laundry and other household purposes and in the smaller rounded 125g size as toilet soap, where it used the same \\"walking baby\\" trademark as the laundry powder and was marketed as a pure, mild product. It was suddenly discontinued by the manufacturers in about 2009 to the disapproval of its faithful customer base. The Fairy brand has expanded further from the soap-based products, and is now also used on automatic dishwashing products; the latest being \\"Fairy Activebursts\\". These are pouches of powder and specially formulated washing-up liquid, which are specifically designed for domestic dishwashers. There are also other variants, a power spray for cleaning pots and pans and for a period of time a foam/mousse was sold. ==Outside the United Kingdom== A bottle of Fairy branded Yes in Sweden * Fairy was released onto the Australian market in 2011 and is quickly growing to become one of the most popular choices available within the country. * In Egypt, Fairy competes with Henkel's Pril, and takes second place to Pril in market share. It is notable for its aggressive advertising campaign featuring actresses from Egyptian television soap operas emphasizing its strength (which it claims is four times higher than Pril). * Fairy is also sold in Germany; in 2000 it was briefly renamed Dawn (the brand used in the North American market), but after sharply declining sales due to an unfamiliar brand, the Fairy name was revived in 2002. * In Sweden and Norway, Fairy is branded as Yes, as seen on the adjacent picture. It was introduced in 1961 and is by far the biggest selling detergent in Sweden. * In Belgium and the Netherlands it is marketed as Dreft.

This emblem had served as the national symbol of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until 2003). ==Official status== The coat of arms was officially adopted by the federal parliament in 1993. It replaced the coat of arms of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which had remained as the coat of arms of the newly-established Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1993. Usage of the arms was discontinued in 2006, after the dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. ==Usage as the coat of arms of Serbia and Montenegro== The legal acts which reconstituted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro stipulated that a law was to be passed by the end of 2003 specifying the Union's coat of arms and anthem. Such a law was never brought forward, and unlike with the national flag and state anthem, no notable proposals for a new coat of arms were ever put forward. Thus the State Union continued to use the Yugoslav arms by inertia until its dissolution in June 2006. ==Heraldic description== Gules, a Two-headed eagle Argent, en surtout an inescutcheon, quarterly 1 and 4 a lion passant Or (Montenegro) and 2 and 3, a cross between four fire steels Argent. (Serbia) ==Origins of coat of arms== The coat of arms was designed after the breakup of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to symbolise the new union consisting only of Serbia and Montenegro. Its design thus features the traditional heraldical elements connected historically with both countries. Throughout history, the arms of both Montenegro and Serbia have featured a double-headed eagle, usually silver, on a shield, usually red, bearing on their chests usually a red shield, which in Montenegro's case contained a golden lion while in Serbia's a cross with four firesteels, usually silver. Thus the arms of FR Yugoslavia were designed by combining these elements: the eagle is the symbol common to both countries, symbolizing their unity, the lions represent Montenegro and crosses with firesteels, Serbia. The red shield in the middle was divided into 4 parts, although the federation consisted of 2 federal units. This was done with the intention to accommodate any possible further expansion of the federation. The coat of arms was initially proposed by Dr. A. Palavestra in 1992.\\"Znamenja naseg identiteta\\", izlozba radova clanova Srpskog heraldickog drustva, Bijeljina, 1994.

While many Grand Masters chose to hold the position for life, abdication was not unknown. Some masters chose to leave for life in monasteries or diplomacy. Grand Masters often led their knights into battle on the front line and the numerous occupational hazards of battle made some tenures very short. Each country had its own Master, and the Masters reported to the Grand Master. He oversaw all of the operations of the Order, including both the military operations in the Holy Land and eastern Europe, and the financial and business dealings in the Order's infrastructure of western Europe. The Grand Master controlled the actions of the order but he was expected to act the same way as the rest of the knights.

Cleland Conservation Park conserves a significant area of natural bushland on the Adelaide Hills face and includes the internationally popular Cleland Wildlife Park and the popular tourist destinations of Mount Lofty summit and Waterfall Gully. It is maintained by the South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR). The conservation park was named for Sir John Burton Cleland (1878-1971), a renowned naturalist, microbiologist, mycologist and ornithologist, and member of the Royal Society of South Australia. After a career in medicine and pathology, Cleland became keenly interested in wildlife conservation.R. V. Southcott, 'Cleland, Sir John Burton (1878–1971)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, , published in hardcopy 1981, accessed online 18 April 2014. The conservation park occupies land in the gazetted suburbs of Cleland, Crafers and Waterfall Gully. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category II protected area. ==Cleland Wildlife Park== People with emus Western grey kangaroos in the park The Wildlife Park is accessible by sealed road from both the South Eastern Freeway and Greenhill Road, and on foot on a formed but steep track from Waterfall Gully or Mount Lofty. A limited public bus service operates. A fee is payable to enter the Wildlife Park (but not to the Conservation Park except for car parking at Mt Lofty summit). Facilities include a souvenir shop, cafe and toilets. Many visitors pay to be photographed holding koalas. Several other options are available to visitors, including an Aboriginal guide on a Cultural Tour of the Yurridla Aboriginal Trail, which explains dreaming stories of dingoes, emus, koalas, Yurrabilla, the creation ancestor, and a nightwalk, uncovering the secrets of the bush. Cleland Wildlife Park offers visitors an opportunity to walk through large enclosures and interact with Australian animals such as kangaroos, koalas and emus, and to see others including wombats, Dingo and many bird and reptile species. In November 2017 a concept plan was announced by the Weatherill government to revamp the park, including a hotel and a cable car connection, but the plan was described by critics as \\"pre-election glitter\\".Cleland Park proposal in Adelaide Hills is just 'pre-election glitter', former Democrat says ABC News, 28 November 2017. Retrieved 6 March 2018. The Weatherill government was not returned at the subsequent election in March 2018. ==Protected Area and Biodiversity Conservation== There are seven major anthropogenic threats to biodiversity: habitat fragmentation, destruction, degradation (including pollution), overexploitation of species for human consumption, disease increases, introduction of invasive species, and global climate change. These activities such as agricultural expansion, reckless industrialisation and urbanisation, altered the ecosystems and distribution of species. Land use change has led to the degradation, fragmentation and destruction of habitats, therefore triggered the species movement and loss of biodiversity and species extinctions worldwide. There is a need to conserve and restore what humans have changed in the ecosystem on both a large and small scale. According to IUCN, protected areas are areas of land or sea dedicated by law or traditions (governance regimes, scientific, traditional knowledge and community-based approaches) to implementation of protection of biodiversity. IUCN protected area management categories has classified the protected areas according to their management goals and objectives. These classifications are recognised by the United Nations and many national governments. IUCN protected area designations are: Ia) Strict Nature Reserve, Ib) Wilderness Area, II) National Park, III) Natural Monument or Feature, IV) Habitat/Species Management Area, V) Protected Landscape/Seascape, VI) Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources. The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 (NPW Act) in South Australia provides the establishment and administration of reserves for conservation of wildlife in a natural environment, public benefit and pleasure and for other purposes. Cleland Conservation Park has established in 1st of Jan 1945 and classified as Category II protected area in IUCN protected area management categories. Primary objective for Category II is \\"to protect natural biodiversity along with its underlying ecological structure and supporting environmental processes, and to promote education and recreation.\\" The current categories and order of the schedules were last reviewed in 2008 and under the NPW Act are: Schedule 7: Endangered species (also including critically endangered and extinct species) Schedule 8: Vulnerable species Schedule 9: Rare speciesThe “Rare category” described here, have been created to be utilized in South Australia and it is consistence with 'Near threatened' category in current IUCN definitions (include species with naturally limited existence and decreasing in number ==Conservation Prioritization and Management Plans== Identifying priorities for conservation is the first requirement within a protected area. An effective conservation action requires detailed information about the ecosystem, species and their distribution, as well as the distribution of any that may affect them. Conservation planners should address three questions: “What needs to be protected?”, “Where should it be protected?” and “How should it be protected?” All the reserves and parks in South Australia are proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 (NPW Act) and the Wilderness Protection Act 1992 (the WP Act). Conservation of reserves are committed to the Minister under the Crown Land Management Act 2009 (CL Act). A management plan is the utmost important foundation for the direction of managing the reserve. The requirements for the preparation of management plans are outlined in the NPW and WP Acts and need to be prepared soon after the constitution of a reserve. The management plan should identify the vision for the reserve in addition to the strategies and objectives to meet that vision over a 10-year period. Every year, park managers outline the work programs that are aligned with the proposed strategies in the original management plan. Protecting and managing endangered or rare species requires a firm grip of their natural history (their ecology and distinctive characteristics). These essential information are: the species’ morphology, physiology, demography, behaviour, distribution, genetics, environment, biotic interactions as well as interactions with people. The information can be achieved by studying published or unpublished literature and field work. Field work is crucial since only a small percentage of the world's species have been studied. The data in field work is collected by using long term monitoring, surveying, censuses and demographic studies which can determine the historical change of the population size. This enables the managers to distinguish short term fluctuations from the long term decline of population size. Natural Resources Adelaide & Mt Lofty Ranges (AMLR) are following four main strategies to conserve the biodiversity of the region: I) Maintain intact (viable) landscapes, II) reverse declines, III) control emerging threats, IV) recover threatened species and ecological communities. ==Biodiversity Threatening Processes in Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges (AMLR)== Threatening processes are practices or environmental factors that could threaten the survival or evolutionary development of species, populations, ecosystems and/or ecological communities. There are direct (legal and illegal ) threats impacting biodiversity in AMLR including historical vegetation clearances, the use of biological resources, climate change (causing drought and severe weather), the introduction of exotic species and poisoning practices. There are also threats associated with roads and transportation which cause wild life mortality. These have damaged the habitats, functioning of ecosystems, availability of food and the overall food web. According to Informing Biodiversity Conservation for the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Region, South Australian ecological stresses are:Department of Environment and Heritage (2010). \\"Informing Biodiversity Conservation for the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Region South Australia: Priorities, Strategies and Targets\\" # Habitat fragmentation # Edge effects, spatial and temporal provision of resources # Ecosystem conversion, habitat loss and modification # Fragmentation of existing habitat (isolation of populations) # Barriers to dispersal # Reduced reproduction/ recruitment # Distance effects (isolation) # Species mortality # Road mortality # Species disturbance # Indirect species effects (e.g. inbreeding, increased competition and loss of pollinator or host) # Ecosystem degradation # Altered fire regimes # Altered hydro logical regimes. Fire is an ecological stresses that threat to biodiversity while is a valuable management tool as well.\\"more detailed descriptions of threats can be found in the AMLR Regional NRM Plan, and the Regional Recovery Plan for Threatened Species & Ecological Communities of Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges 2009-2014.\\" ==Native Plants and Animals Biodiversity in Adelaide Mount Lofty Ranges== The Adelaide Mount Lofty Ranges (AMLR) region is home to a range of native plants and animals. Native Plants Around 1,500 species of native plants including orchids, ferns, gum trees, herbs, lilies, grasses and rushes, originate within AMLR. Amongst those, 121 are nationally threatened while seven are considered to be threatened in the region. The two endangered plant species in the region are Fleurieu Peninsula Guinea-flower (Hibbertia tenuis) and Mount Compass oak-bush (Allocasuarina robusta). Native Animals There are a great number of different native animals in the AMLR region, however some of these species have already become extinct and many are endangered. These threatened and endangered animals include birds, mammals, reptiles, frogs and freshwater fish. The details are given below. Birds The AMLR region comprises 249 species of birds, 69 of which are considered threatened. The three species that are considered Endangered are: the Chestnut-rumped heathwren (Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri), the Mt Lofty Ranges Southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus intermedius) and the Orange- bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster). Mammals The AMLR region comprises 27 species of native mammals, including an echidna, an antechinus, dunnart species, a bandicoot, possums, wombat, kangaroos, rats and bats. Seven species are considered threatened in a state or national level. The Southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus obesulus) and Western pygmy possum (Cercartetus concinnus) are considered vulnerable, while the Brush-tailed Bettong (Bettongia penicillata penicillata) has been listed as endangered. Reptiles The AMLR region comprises 68 species of native reptiles, including turtles, lizards, tortoises, geckos, legless lizards, skinks, snakes and goanna species. Six of the species are considered threatened, and the Heath goanna (Varanus rosenbergi) and Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis) are listed as endangered. Frogs The AMLR region comprises 7 native frog species. The Brown Toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) is rare in South Australia and considered vulnerable in the region. Freshwater fish The AMLR region comprises 20 native freshwater fish, including catfish, galaxiids, lampreys and eels. Three of these species are considered threatened nationally while Climbing Galaxias (Galaxias brevipinnis), Congolli (Pseudaphritis urvillii), Mountain Galaxias (Galaxias olidus) and Pouched Lamprey (Geotria australis) are considered Vulnerable in the region. ==Long-term Monitoring of Species and Ecosystem== Protection of species or individual populations is usually achievable via conservation and restoration of habitats. To do so, collecting essential data on biological communities and ecosystem function are important. Therefore, long term monitoring of populations needs to be accompanied by monitoring of the environment parameters. To determine the health of ecosystem, observation of the ecosystem processes such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and soil erosion, is necessary. Monitoring the community characteristics such as the present species and amount of biomass, are also other parameters in a healthy ecosystem. By monitoring the studies of these parameters, it enables managers to decide whether or not the goals of their projects are being achieved or if management plans need to be adjusted. According to Primack (2010), there are “lagging” effects on the environment that may not surface for years after the original causes. This “lagging” creates a huge challenge towards understanding the changing of ecosystems. Hence, long term monitoring programs provide an early warning for threats to the functioning of ecosystems and communities of species. Examples as mentioned below, can address the conservation/knowledge gaps and help to refine the management priorities: Changing in conservation status, an alarm towards becoming extinct The Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis) had been classified extinct until its rediscovery near Burra in South Australia in 1992. It is classified as Endangered in South Australia. Another example Chestnut-rumped heathwren status has changed from Vulnerable in 2008, to Endangered in 2016. Also, Western Pygmy Possum were listed as Vulnerable in AMRL in 2008 and became Critically Endangered in the Adelaide and Mt Lofty Ranges Region in Sep 2015. Different emerging threats and species response In 2008 wildfire was counted as the primary potential threat to Chestnut-rumped heathwren while deliberate burning, residential development (habitat has been cleared/fragmented) and dieback due to Phytophthora, were the secondary threats. However, high threats in 2010 recorded as drought, climate change and roadside accidents (due to inappropriate access and works). The Southern brown bandicoot's (Isoodon obesulus obesulus) decline in 2008 was due to some threats like loss or degradation of woodland habitat (exposed habitats as the result of kangaroos overgrazing), broad scale removal of habitats, predation (from introduced species like foxes and feral cats) and fire. In contrast, the decline of bandicoots in 2010 was due to climate change and drought, weed invasion (predominantly woody weeds) and dieback (particularly Phytophthora cinnamomi). These threats in addition to some other threats (nutrient input, altered hydrological regimes and fire regimes) have degraded the health of the forests and hence bandicoot habitats in general.Informing Biodiversity Conservation for the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Region, South Australia. (2010) (1st ed.). \\"Lagging time\\" needs to be considered for predictions and future projects planning Harris, in one of his work that published in 2009, mentioned Western pygmy possum (Cercartetus concinnus) as \\"Least concern, Lower risk\\" in IUCN list. At the time of his work, the species was not recognized to be endangered in the national or state level in Victoria, Western Australia or South Australia. However, at the same time, New South Wales listed this species as endangered since their distribution was threatened by massive vegetation clearing, the reduction of food sources (by overgrazing of livestock), fire regimes and introduced predators (like red fox and domestic cats) and some native Australian carnivores such as quolls, snakes and owls. While the Western pygmy possum's conservation status remained Vulnerable in AMRL in 2008 and 2014, its latest status is Critically Endangered in the Adelaide and Mt Lofty Ranges Region in 2015. This could indicate some knowledge gaps about this particular species' responses. Threatened species and ecological communities response During Ash Wednesday bushfires in the South East in Feb 1983, many areas were severely burnt (including Scrub, Whennan's, Mount McIntyre, Yeate's, Millicent Golf Course, Mount Burr Mill Drop, East McRostie's, West McRostie's, Brooksby Road and Hackett Hill), Southern brown bandicoots inhabited those areas again (except Yeate's) by as early as April 1990. The study suggested that during the Ashe Wednesday bushfires, bandicoots moved through the extensive pine plantations and migrated to native vegetation in the neighbourhood. They found dispersal corridors along the edge of the fire by using the dense ground cover. However, in Cleland and the Mt Lofty Ranges, Paull stated that “It is not known whether bandicoots survived the fires within these patches in refugal areas or whether they recolonised from neighbouring unburnt patches.” The importance of habitat quality as well as degradation/fragmentation and destruction The study by Paull (1995) suggested that the response of the Southern brown bandicoot to fire (controlled burns and uncontrolled bushfires) needed to be evaluated. In his article, Paull indicated that bandicoots preferred habitats that regenerated into patchy mosaics of scrub as they were less likely to be effected by bushfires. Further studies by him confirmed that bandicoots were vulnerable because of habitat fragmentation (an outcome of extensive historical vegetation clearance) and predation by feral carnivores in the South East and Mount Lofty Ranges. Also, the Mount Lofty Ranges’ Chestnut-rumped heathwren are endangered nationally and in SA according to the IUCN Red List since it has a small population and distribution which is continuing to decline further. This bird is threatened by habitat fragmentation caused by extensive land clearance through the region, residential development, invasion by woody weeds and feral predators. On the habitat quality subject for the Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis), it has been observed that when artificial burrows were offered in the field to lizards, all lizards preferred vertical burrows over angled burrows, while juvenile lizards preferred shallower burrows than did adult lizards. Observation of 36 artificial burrows showed a significant increase in lizard numbers, during 2001-02 and over three surveys. The same study suggested that this local increase in population could be due to lizards locating appropriate burrows much more easily. The overall success could be appreciated as a tool for conservation management of this endangered species. Another study compared the fitness of female pygmy blue-tongue lizards in natural burrows and artificial ones, over a 3-year period. The study showed that the females in the artificial burrows had better body conditions and produced larger offspring with better body conditions also. Cost effective monitoring Operations of projects are determined by district and regional priorities and resource availability such as funding and staffing. A study on Chestnut-rumped heathwren showed that to predict the risk of extinction precisely, assessment of the trends of population size and distribution are required. Therefore, choosing the most cost-effective monitoring techniques for species with low density and visibility are key factors for managers. Although effective detection of population trends is essential for managing species under threat, the main factor is the amount of money available for the monitoring technique. ==Mount Lofty summit== This popular tourist destination is above sea level. It provides sweeping vistas across the Adelaide Plains and Gulf St Vincent. Flinders Column, a white painted obelisk shaped like a lighthouse, is a landmark which can be seen from far away on a clear day. Car parking facilities are provided: charges are payable. Public bus route 823 serves the summit with three journeys a day (including weekends and most holidays). Other facilities include an information centre/ souvenir shop, a cafe/restaurant (closed Mondays) and public toilets. ==Waterfall Gully== Yellow-footed rock wallabies in the park Cape Barren goose Waterfall Gully, another popular part of the park, is located on its western edge. It can be accessed via the sealed Waterfall Gully Road. A limited amount of free car parking is provided. There is no scheduled public transport service. Other facilities include a kiosk/restaurant and public toilets. The main attraction is a waterfall, the largest of several in the park. The base is a short walk from the car park and the top can be reached by a formed but steep footpath, which continues to Cleland Wildlife Park and Mount Lofty summit. ==Other== By far the largest part of the park consists of bushland, mostly woodland with some open spaces where clearing has taken place. There are a number of walking trails, including the Waterfall Gully - Mount Lofty summit trail which is a popular and reasonably challenging ascent of the west side of Mount Lofty, and parts of the long distance Heysen and Yurrebilla Trails, which run north–south along the higher ground in the east of the park. As of 22 December 2012, many trails in the park became shared-use, allowing mountain bikers to also make use of the trails. ==See also== *List of protected areas in Adelaide *Cleland (disambiguation) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Cleland Conservation Park official webpage *Cleland Conservation Park webpage on protected planet Category:Protected areas in Adelaide Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Wildlife sanctuaries of Australia Category:1945 establishments in Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1945 Category:Wildlife Parks in Australia ","title":"Cleland Conservation Park"},{"id":"2000525","text":"View of Cserehat Hills at Abaújlak, Szanticska, Hungary Szanticska is a former village in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County, Hungary.

In 1870 it was annexed to Abaújlak. Between the World Wars the village prospered, but the population started to decrease in the 1930s, mostly because the village didn't have a school. In 1988 the village had only one resident. During the 1990s Szanticska experienced a revival; some new residents settled down in the village and now it is a holiday resort where people can have an insight into everyday life of Hungarian peasants in the 19th century.

Under the Reform Act 1832, Leicestershire was split into two divisions, North and South, which each elected two members. The Reform Act 1885 redistributed these seats into four single-member divisions: Melton, or Eastern, Loughborough, or Mid, Harborough, or Southern, and Bosworth, or Western. At the 1918 general election, the four divisions of the county were retained, and the borough of Leicester was split into three single-member constituencies, Leicester East, Leicester South, and Leicester West. From 1950 to 1974 Leicester had four constituencies, these being Leicester North East, Leicester North West, Leicester South East and Leicester South West: the three seat arrangement of South, East and West was reverted to thereafter. Rutland constituted a constituency on its own until 1918, when it became part of the Rutland and Stamford constituency, with nearby Stamford in Lincolnshire. In 1983, seats in Leicestershire were redrawn. Rutland was merged with Melton to form Rutland and Melton, with Loughborough, Bosworth, and Harborough remaining as seat names. The new North West Leicestershire constituency was created. A further constituency, Charnwood was created in the north for the 1997 election. == Changes for the 2010 general election == Finalised proposals by the Boundary Commission for England retain the 10 constituencies, with changes to realign constituency boundaries with the boundaries of current local government wards, and to reduce the electoral disparity between constituencies. These changes were implemented at the 2010 United Kingdom general election. They have confirmed that the new constituency which almost corresponds to the existing Blaby is renamed South Leicestershire on the grounds that it does not match the borders of Blaby district, and the village of Blaby itself is not one of the major population centres. {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !No. on map !Constituency !2005 boundaries !2010 boundaries |- |1 |Bosworth | rowspan=\\"10\\" |left | rowspan=\\"10\\" |left |- |2 |Charnwood |- |3 |Harborough |- |4 |Leicester East |- |5 |Leicester South |- |6 |Leicester West |- |7 |Loughborough |- |8 |North West Leicestershire |- |9 |Rutland and Melton |- |10 |South Leicestershire (previously Blaby) |} == Proposed boundary changes == The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010. Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota. ==Results history== Primary data source: House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019 === 2019 === The number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Leicestershire and Rutland in the 2019 general election were as follows: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Party !Votes !% !Change from 2017 !Seats !Change from 2017 |- |Conservative |281,019 |53.3% |4.4% |7 |0 |- |Labour |169,475 |32.1% |8.0% |3 |0 |- |Liberal Democrats |51,606 |9.8% |3.2% |0 |0 |- |Greens |18,705 |3.5% |1.4% |0 |0 |- |Brexit |4,050 |0.8% |new |0 |0 |- |Others |2,835 |0.5% |1.8% |0 |0 |- |Total |527,690 |100.0 | |10 | |} === Percentage votes === {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Election year !1983 !1987 !1992 !1997 !2001 !2005 !2010 !2015 !2017 !2019 |- |Conservative |50.6 |52.0 |48.7 |36.8 |38.1 |37.4 |41.0 |43.9 |48.9 |53.3 |- |Labour |25.3 |27.3 |33.0 |43.8 |41.5 |36.1 |27.6 |30.6 |40.1 |32.1 |- |Liberal Democrat1 |22.7 |20.2 |17.1 |15.1 |17.0 |20.8 |23.3 |8.0 |6.6 |9.8 |- |Green Party | - |* |* |* |* |* |0.4 |2.7 |2.1 |3.5 |- |UKIP | - | - | - |* |* |* |2.6 |14.4 |1.8 |* |- |Brexit Party | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |0.8 |- |Other |1.4 |0.5 |1.2 |4.3 |3.4 |5.8 |5.1 |0.4 |0.5 |0.5 |} 11983 & 1987 - SDP- Liberal Alliance * Included in Other === Seats === {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Election year !1983 !1987 !1992 !1997 !2001 !2005 !2010 !2015 !2017 !2019 |- |Conservative |8 |6 |6 |5 |5 |5 |7 |7 |7 |7 |- |Labour |1 |3 |3 |5 |5 |5 |3 |3 |3 |3 |- |Total |9 |9 |9 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |} 11983 & 1987 - SDP- Liberal Alliance === Maps === File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency1983Results.svg|1983 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency1987Results.svg|1987 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency1987Results.svg|1992 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|1997 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|2001 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|2005 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|2010 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|2015 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|2017 File:LeicestershireRutlandParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|2019 ==Historical representation by party== A cell marked → (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name. ===1885 to 1918=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Constituency !1885 !1886 !88 !91 !1892 !94 !1895 !1900 !04 !1906 !06 !Jan 1910 !Dec 1910 !13 !16 |- |Bosworth | colspan=\\"4\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" |Ellis | colspan=\\"8\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" |C.

His father had become an early film distributor in 1908 after previous work as a travelling draper. Blakeley joined his father's business and soon came to understand the tastes of the emerging cinema audiences in the northern industrial towns. By the 1930s, the younger Blakeley was making films starring the idols of northern music hall comedy: George Formby, Frank Randle and Sandy Powell. Dickenson Road Studios in Manchester Initially relying on studios in London, rising costs encouraged him to found the Mancunian Film Studios in his hometown in 1947. With £70,000 capital, a former Methodist chapel on Dickenson Road in Rusholme was converted into a film studio. The studios produced a sequence of profitable films, often on shoestring budgets, until Blakeley's retirement in 1953.

He grew up in Stonesfield, Oxfordshire and attended The Marlborough School in Woodstock. Friend received his professional acting training at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Originally, Friend wanted to be an archaeologist and travel around the world after seeing Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989, but scrapped the idea after realizing that the occupation was perhaps not as exciting as Indiana Jones's adventures had led him to believe. Instead, he turned to acting, in which he was inspired by Marlon Brando who played Vito Corleone, and Daniel Day-Lewis, whom he described as his childhood hero. ==Career== Friend played three minor roles in a stage production of The Laramie Project when he was in his third year in drama school, and was spotted by a casting director and made his acting debut as Billy Downs opposite Johnny Depp in the 2004 film The Libertine, for which he was named \\"outstanding new talent\\" at the 2005 Satellite Awards. In 2005, Friend had his first starring role as Ludovic Meyer in the film adaption of Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, in which he starred opposite Joan Plowright. In the same year, he portrayed Wickham in Joe Wright's version of Pride and Prejudice. In 2008, Friend and Tom Mison wrote, produced and starred in a short film called The Continuing and Lamentable Saga of the Suicide Brothers. The film won Best Short at the Rhode Island International Horror Film Festival (2010). He founded his own production company called Beat Pictures, and he made his directorial debut with a short film in 2010 called Steve, which starred Colin Firth, Keira Knightley and Tom Mison. In addition to directing, he wrote and produced the film, which was later included in the 2012 compilation Stars in Shorts. Steve won Friend the Rhode Island Film Festival Crystal Image Award, and was nominated for the Santa Barbara Film Festival Bruce Corwin Award for Best Short Film. Friend also starred in the film Chéri, playing the titular character opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In addition, he joined the cast of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and played Kurt Kotler, a lieutenant in Nazi Germany. In 2010, Friend played Albert, Prince Consort in Young Victoria. Graham King, producer of Young Victoria, chose Friend to star in the lead role because he remembered his strong performance in Pride and Prejudice. His performance received acclaim, in particular, from historian Alex von Tunzelmann, who praised him for putting in effort in mastering the role. In 2010, Friend made his stage debut as Mitchell in the UK premiere of The Little Dog Laughed. He followed this with Dennis Potter's Brimstone and Treacle, in which he played the lead character to rave reviews. He stars in the film The Kid, based on the novel by Kevin Lewis. As the film involves boxing, he trained himself so as to improve his physical and psychological shape. He also starred in a French film called Lullaby for Pi, playing a singer called Sam. In 2011, he played Thomas Anders, the protagonist of the film 5 Days of War. Friend was asked by Kairos 4tet leader Adam Waldmann to write the lyrics for a track on their 2011 album Statement of Intent, and was then asked to write all the lyrics for their 2013 album Everything We Hold, which received rave reviews. His lyrics were sung by Marc O'Reilly, Omar Lye-Fook, and Emilia Martensson. In 2014, Friend played Oliver Baumer in Fox Searchlight's film Starred Up. His performance was applauded by critics and was nominated for BIFA Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2015, Friend starred as Agent 47 in Hitman: Agent 47, a film based on the Hitman video game franchise, replacing Paul Walker. In order to play the role, he had to shave all his hair. He performed most of his own stunts. The production team also sent him copies of all the Hitman games for him to familiarize himself with the character. Friend played a major role as Peter Quinn in the political thriller series Homeland. Introduced in season two as a supporting character, his role became significantly larger after season three. His performance received widespread acclaim and he was nominated for three different awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor In A Drama Series in 2013. Friend reprised his role as Quinn in the fifth season of Homeland, which was filmed entirely in Berlin, Germany and premiered on 4 October 2015 and was mourned by the press after the sixth (his final) season. In the same year, Friend provided narration for Nick Knight's folk horror fashion film, The Face of a Dying Dog. Friend has become known as a \\"sneaky MVP when it comes to comedic supporting performances\\", appearing in Paul Feig's A Simple Favor, starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively in which he was offered the lead role, but turned it down to play a funny cameo instead. He also displayed \\"serious comedic chops\\" in Armando Iannucci's five-star reviewed The Death of Stalin. Friend played the role of rebellious wildman Ernest Donovan in Strange Angel from 2018 to 2019, and his performance was praised as being \\"an open book in a language no-one can read\\". In 2018 Friend performed a new audio drama by John Patrick Shanley, titled Last Night in the Garden I Saw You, which featured Michelle Williams (actress). The following year, Friend was asked by internationally renowned screenwriter David Koepp to narrate his debut novel Cold Storage for HarperCollins AudioBooks. He voiced the character of Peter Hardy in the 2019 Gimlet scripted podcast Motherhacker. In an interview on BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme, James Bond casting director Debbie McWilliams stated that Friend was asked if he'd like to be considered for the role of James Bond but he turned the screentest down. After his worldwide success with Homeland, however, there was renewed speculation that he is on the shortlist to succeed Daniel Craig as 007. ==Personal life== From 2005 to 2010, Friend dated English actress Keira Knightley, whom he met when filming Pride & Prejudice. He met American athlete and actress Aimee Mullins in 2013, and they became engaged in December 2014. Friend and Mullins were married on 1 May 2016. ==FilmographyFilm=== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- ! Year !! Title !!

In the United States, Federal Rule of Evidence 404 maps out its permissible and prohibited uses in trials. Three factors typically determine the admissibility of character evidence: # the purpose the character evidence is being used for # the form in which the character evidence is offered # the type of proceeding (civil or criminal) in which the character evidence is offered ==Purpose== In the United States, character evidence may be offered at trial to :1. prove character, if character is a substantive issue in the litigation ::admissibility of character evidence to prove character is not affected by the case's civil or criminal nature :2. prove, through circumstantial evidence, an aspect of an individual's conduct ::character evidence's admissibility as circumstantial evidence is influenced by the case's civil or criminal nature :3. impeach or strengthen the credibility of a witness Character may be a substantive issue in defamation suits, in lawsuits alleging negligent hiring or negligent entrustment, in child custody cases, as well as in loss of consortium cases; character evidence is thus admissible to prove the substantive issues that arise in these types of lawsuits. If used as circumstantial evidence, FRE 404(a)(1) renders inadmissible character evidence offered to prove that an individual acted \\"in accordance with\\" a character or trait \\"on a particular occasion.\\"FRE 404, Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute It lists several exceptions which apply depending on whether the proceeding is civil or criminal, whether the defense or prosecution is offering the character evidence, and what purpose it is being offered for. ==Form== Character evidence may be offered, depending on the type of proceeding, party offering, and purported purpose, explained below, in three forms: # as opinion # as reputation evidence, and # as evidence of specific instances of conduct ==Type of proceedingCivil trial=== In the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, character evidence is inadmissible in civil suits when being used as circumstantial evidence to prove that a person acted in conformity with their character; it is considered to be an unfair basis from which to attempt to prove that an individual behaved in a particular way on a particular occasion.Pino v. Koelber, 389 So. 2d 1191, 1193 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1980), citing 1 S. Gard, Jones on Evidence §4:34 (6th ed. 1972) and McCormick on Evidence § 188 (2d ed. 1972): \\"When a person's character is an essential element in the case, evidence of his character is always admissible because it is in issue. On the other hand, evidence of one's character which is offered only as tending to prove the probability that he acted in a manner consistent with that character on a particular occasion is generally inadmissible.\\" Another way of looking at this is that character evidence is only admissible in a majority of jurisdictions in a civil trial if character is actually a substantive issue in the case (negligent hiring; negligent entrustment, child custody cases, loss of consortium cases), or to impeach a witness. A minority of U.S. jurisdictions, however, permit defendants in assault and battery and fraudulent misconduct civil cases to introduce character evidence as circumstantial evidence to prove that a person acted in conformity with their character.Wrabek v. Suchomel, 145 Minn. 468, 177 N.W. 764 (1920): \\"The complaint alleged that, in addition to inflicting injuries upon his person by an assault, defendants intended to injure, and by the publicity of the assault did injure, plaintiff's standing and reputation as a citizen in the community where he lived. The general denial in the answers put plaintiff's reputation as a citizen in issue, and entitled defendants to show, in mitigation of damages, that it was bad.\\" ===Criminal trial==Character evidence offered by the prosecution==== In the United States, character evidence is inadmissible in a criminal trial if first offered by the prosecution as circumstantial evidence to show that a defendant is likely to have committed the crime with which he or she is charged—the prosecution may not, in other words, initiate character evidence that shows defendant's propensity to commit a crime. However the prosecution may introduce character evidence for certain limited purposes after the defendant does so—after the defendant has \\"opened the door\\"—through the permissible methods and purposes explained below in \\"Character evidence offered by the defendant,\\" to rebut what defendant tried showing through character evidence, and to \\"offer evidence of the defendant's same trait.\\"FRE 404(a)(2)(B)(i)-(ii), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute FRE 404, in addition to dictating character evidence's permissible use in federal courts, also bars the prosecution's admission of \\"crimes, wrongs, or other acts\\"FRE 404(b), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith (propensity). Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is available for \\"non- character purposes,\\" such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. In a criminal prosecution, the defendant can request to receive notice of this type of evidence if the prosecution intends to admit it at trial. FRE 404(b)(2), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute * Note that under California Evidence Code (\\"CEC\\") §1101(b), in addition to proving MIMIC elements, the prosecution may admit evidence of a victim's prior sexual conduct in a case brought for an unlawful sexual act or attempted unlawful sexual act, to show that the defendant \\"did not reasonably and in good faith believe that the victim consented.\\" ====Character evidence offered by the defendant==== Character evidence is admissible in a criminal trial if offered by a defendant as circumstantial evidence—through reputation or opinion evidence—to show their own character, as long as the character evidence the defendant seeks to introduce is relevant to the crime with which the defendant is charged.U.S. Code Title 28a Committee Notes on Rules—2006 Amendment, Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute: \\"In criminal cases, the so-called “mercy rule” permits a criminal defendant to introduce evidence of pertinent character traits of the defendant and the victim.\\" For example, if a defendant is charged with a crime involving dishonesty, defendant may introduce evidence tending to show defendant's honest character. If defendant is charged with a violent crime, defendant may introduce evidence tending to show defendant's peaceful character. * Note that under CEC §1102, a defendant may not only introduce evidence of \\"a trait of his character\\" that is relevant to the crime with which he or she is charged, but may also introduce character evidence \\"of the defendant's character\\" generally. Character evidence is also admissible in a criminal trial if offered by a defendant as circumstantial evidence—through reputation or opinion evidence—to show an alleged victim's \\"pertinent\\" character trait—for example, to support defendant's claim of self-defense to a charge of homicide.FRE 404(a)(2)(B), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute After a criminal defendant introduces evidence of the victim's character, the prosecution may then introduce its own character evidence to rebut the defendant's character evidence by showing its side's impression of the victim's character, or to attack the character of the defendant through evidence that shows that defendant had the same character trait he or she accused the victim of having.FRE 404(a)(2)(B)(i), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute * Note that under CEC §1103(a), a defendant may not only introduce evidence of a victim's character or character trait through reputation or opinion evidence, as permitted under FRE 404, but also through evidence of specific acts. The admissibility of character evidence to allow defendant to prove the character trait of a victim is limited, however, if the lawsuit is for rape or assault with the intent to commit rape. If the reputation or opinion evidence is being offered by the defendant to show the rape victim's past sexual conduct, character evidence is inadmissible. FRE 412, Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute In such sexual misconduct cases, a defendant may offer \\"evidence of specific instances of a victim’s sexual behavior\\" only to show that someone other than the defendant was the source of \\"semen, injury, or other physical evidence,\\" or to show that the victim had consented to sexual behavior with the defendant. * Note that under CEC §1103(c)(1), reputation, opinion, and specific acts evidence are all barred if defendant seeks to introduce the evidence to show the sexual character of the victim, but evidence of the victim's sexual conduct with the defendant—i.e. specific acts—may be used by defendant to show that the victim consented to the sexual act. == Character witness == Commentators have noted that the ability of defendants to call character witnesses can give an advantage to more affluent defendants. Affluent defendants can call as character witnesses celebrities, athletes, and prominent members of the community. In contrast, it would be neither advisable nor beneficial to a defendant to call to the stand a disreputable fellow inmate as a character witness. ==Distinguished from habit evidence== Character evidence must be distinguished from habit evidence, which is generally admissible, and which is evidence submitted for the purpose of proving that an individual acted in a particular way on a particular occasion in question based on that person's tendency to reflexively respond to a particular situation in a particular way. ==See also== *Character test under Australian Migration Act 1958 ==ReferencesExternal links== *Federal Rule of Evidence 404, Cornell University Law School *Complete text of Federal Rules of Evidence, Cornell University Law School *Complete text of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Cornell University Law School Category:Evidence law ","title":"Character evidence"},{"id":"2000600","text":"The know your customer or know your client (KYC) guidelines in financial services requires that professionals make an effort to verify the identity, suitability, and risks involved with maintaining a business relationship. The procedures fit within the broader scope of a bank's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy. KYC processes are also employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed customers, agents, consultants, or distributors are anti-bribery compliant, and are actually who they claim to be. Banks, insurers, export creditors and other financial institutions are increasingly demanding that customers provide detailed due diligence information. Initially, these regulations were imposed only on the financial institutions but now the non-financial industry, fintech, virtual assets dealers, and even the non-profit organizations are liable to oblige. == Standards == The objective of KYC guidelines is to prevent businesses from being used by criminal elements for money laundering. Related procedures also enable businesses to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. This helps them manage their risks in a well-judged manner. Today, KYC principles apply to banks as well as different online businesses. They usually frame their KYC policies incorporating the following four key elements: * Customer acceptance policy; * Customer identification procedures; * Monitoring of transactions; and * Risk management. The stringent regulatory environment establishes KYC as a mandatory and crucial procedure for financial institutions as well as non-financial institutions. As it minimizes the risk of fraud, by identifying suspicious elements earlier on in the client-business relationship. For the purposes of a KYC policy, a customer/user may be defined as: * a person or entity that maintains an account or has a business relationship with the reporting entity; * one on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial owner); * beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries such as stockbrokers, Chartered Accountants, or solicitors, as permitted under the law; or * any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant reputational or other risks to the bank, for example, a wire transfer or issue of a high-value demand draft as a single transaction. ==Laws by country== *Australia: The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), established in 1989, monitors financial transactions in Australiahttps://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2016C01046 and sets client identification requirements. *Canada: The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), established in 2000, is Canada's financial intelligence unit. It updated its regulations in June 2016 regarding acceptable methods to determine the identity of individual clients to ensure compliance with AML and KYC regulations. A pending lawsuit is active in Canada challenging the legality of the new legislation. *India: The Reserve Bank of India introduced KYC guidelines for banks in 2002. *Italy: The Banca d'Italia exercises regulation power for the financial industry, in 2007 set KYC requirements for financial institutions that operate on Italian territory. *Japan: Act on identification of customers by financial institutions 2003 *South Korea: Act on Reporting and Use of Certain Financial Transaction Information regulates due diligence in the country. *Luxembourg: KYC is governed in the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and regulations, which became effective in 1993 and were amended for the last time in 2015. *Mexico: The \\"Federal Law for Prevention and Identification of Operations with Resources from Illicit Origin\\", promulgated in 2012 with president Felipe Calderon administration and came into force in 2013 with the president Enrique Peña Nieto administration.{LEY FEDERAL PARA LA PREVENCIÓN E IDENTIFICACIÓN DE OPERACIONES CON RECURSOS DE PROCEDENCIA ILÍCITA *Namibia: Financial Intelligence Act, 2012 (Act No. 13 of 2012) published as Government Notice 299 in Gazette 5096 of 14 December 2012. *New Zealand: Updated KYC laws were enacted in late 2009 and entered into force in 2010. KYC is mandatory for all registered banks and financial institutions (the latter has an extremely wide meaning). *Singapore: Various industries in Singapore are subject to AML/CFT requirements, including requirements promulgated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore applicable to financial institutions. *South Africa: The Financial Intelligence Centre Act 38 of 2001 (FICA) *United Kingdom: The Money Laundering Regulations 2017 are the underlying rules that govern KYC in the UK. Many UK businesses use the guidance provided by the European Joint Money Laundering Steering Group along with the Financial Conduct Authority's 'Financial Crime: A guide for firms' as an aid to compliance. *United States: Pursuant to the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Secretary of the Treasury was required to finalize regulations before October 26, 2002 making KYC mandatory for all US banks. The related processes are required to conform to a customer identification program (CIP). == KYCC == KYCC or Know Your Customer's Customer is a process that identifies a customer's customer activities and nature. This includes the identification of those people, assessing their associated risk levels and associated activities the customer's customer (business) is involved in. KYCC is a derivative of the standard KYC process, that was necessitated from the growing risk of fraud originating from fraudulent individuals or companies, that might otherwise be hiding in second-tier business relationships. i.e. (a customer's customer). == KYB == Know Your Business or simply KYB is an extension of KYC laws implemented to reduce money laundering. KYB is a set of practices to verify a business. It includes verification of registration credentials, location, the UBOs (Ultimate Beneficial Owners) of that business, etc. Also, the business is screened against blacklists and grey lists to check that it was involved in any sort of criminal activity such as money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption, etc. KYB is significant in identifying fake business entities and shell companies. it is crucial for efficient KYC and AML compliance. Things you should know about KYC and KYB before compliance published on 30 December 2019 https://hackernoon.com/things-you-should-know-about-kyc-and-kyb-before- compliance-e06b32t5 == Controversies == Controversies over this legislation/regulation/policy include: * Know your customer places a costly burden on businesses operating in the financial industry, especially smaller financial companies where compliance costs are disproportionately heavy. * Customers may feel the information requested to be intrusive and burdensome and may choose not to enter the business relationship as a result. * Innocent, law abiding individuals such as digital nomads are very likely disproportionately disadvantaged as living a nomadic life makes it increasingly difficult or even impossible to hold any formal banking relationship anyplace in the world due to lack of proof of address, bills, and/or debt documentation required by KYC. * Retired people who travel within their own country without having a permanent fixed address may also be disproportionately disadvantaged for the same reason. * Jurisdictions across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific indicated that all of these jurisdictions permit a form of reliance on customer information provided by third parties. In many instances this data is incorrect, potential bank customers may be unaware of the error and there is no grievance procedure to correct or sanction the bad data provider. * Some citizens in other countries (Canada) are fighting back against USA over-reach into their sovereign banking system and have challenged new USA law in their courts. * The intelligence division at the Treasury Department has repeatedly and systematically violated domestic surveillance laws by snooping on the private financial records of US citizens and companies, according to government sources. ==See also== * Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering * Anti-money laundering * Anti-money laundering software * Anti-bribery * Anti-corruption * Politically exposed person * Certified copy ==References== Category:Bank regulation Category:Banking in India ","title":"Know your customer"},{"id":"2000620","text":"Ketan Parekh is a former stock broker from Mumbai, India, who was convicted in 2008, for involvement in the Indian stock market manipulation scam that occurred from late 1998 to 2001. During this period, Parekh artificially rigged prices of certain chosen securities (informally referred to as K-10 stocks), using large sums of money borrowed from banks including the Madhavpura Mercantile Co-operative Bank, of which he himself was a director. As a result, he was barred from trading in the Indian stock exchanges till 2017. ==Early career== Parekh, after becoming a Chartered Accountant , started his career in the late 1980s at Narbheram Harakchand Securities (NH Securities), a reputed institutional brokerage firm. In the 90s, he came in contact with Harshad Mehta, a well known stock broker and subsequently joined Mehta's firm GrowMore investments, a firm that Mehta had set up and which was involved in the 1992 Indian stock market scam. Though one of the accused in some of the scams that Growmore was involved in, Parekh was never convicted in them. Unlike Mehta, Parekh ensured that he remained low key, with a simple lifestyle thus presenting a humble \\"feet-on-the-ground\\" demeanor even when interviewed by journalists like Sucheta Dalal, as she related in her 2003 article in rediff. However, this started to change in 1999-2000 as Parekh got closer to celebrities. Parekh began cultivating friendships with people in Bollywood including Amitabh Bachchan and the diamond merchant Bharat Shah, thus coming into the media's eye and limelight. This led to an investigative story on him which was first published on 25 August 2000 covering a millennial bash that he had given at his palatial bungalow at Mandwa (near Mumbai), which was attended by Mumbai's gliteratti, industrialists and media personalities. This was followed by his acquiring expensive luxury cars including a Cadillac, throwing regular high profile parties that were eagerly lapped up by the tabloid media. His pictures began to appear in newspapers with his comments on matters related to finance and the budget. The media covered every incident in his life including that of him forming KVP Ventures (a collaboration with Vinay Maloo and the Australian magnate Kerry Packer), forming an investment bank (Triumph international) and turning the loss making ABCL into a profitable firm by arranging funding from HFCL. https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2001/12/30/stories/14301804.htm He invested heavily in stocks related to IT, media and communication and propagated them. As cover stories emerged in the financial media of his malpractices related to the stock market, scrutiny shifted to his activities leading to his arrest on 30 March 2001. ==Role in 2001 stock market crash == ketan parekh purchased large stakes in less known small market capitalization companies, and jacked up their prices through circular trading with other traders, and collusion with these companies and large institutional investors. This resulted in steep hikes in share prices (for example: shares of Zee telefilms zoomed up from Rs. 127 to a price of Rs. 10,000. This set of ten stocks was colloquially referred to as \\"K-10\\" stocks and Parekh was playfully referred to as \\"Pentafour\\". It later transpired that promoters and industrialists often gave Parekh funds to artificially rig up their share prices. Thus in just a few months, scrips of virtually unknown companies like Visualsoft rose from Rs 625 to Rs 8,448 per share and Sonata Software rose from Rs 90 to Rs 2,936.60. However, the bear cartel in Bombay stock exchange started to hammer his K-10 stocks in February 2001, leading them to fall and precipitating a payment crisis in Kolkata. On 1 March 2001, just after the Indian Union Budget had been presented, the BSE Sensex crashed 176 points, prompting the then NDA government to set up an inquiry into the market reaction. Subsequently the RBI refused to clear pay orders (POs) that had been given by Parekh as collateral for loans to BOI (Bank of India), as they found them to be suspicious. The RBI commenced an investigation against Parekh. Around the same time, a bear cartel of brokers in Mumbai opposed to Parekh tried to dump their shares of K-10 stocks. Panicking, Parekh sold off his entire ownership of the so called K-10 stocks that he had successfully jacked up over the past two years, especially those of two entities - GTB bank and MMCB bank. He carried out this large scale dump in the evening, after regular trading hours, from 5 pm to midnight at the Calcutta Stock Exchange. This resulted in a stock market crash the next day, resulting in large scale losses for large institutional investors, including insurance companies and mutual funds. A 30 member Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation ensued which found that Parekh had been involved in circular trading throughout the time period from and with a variety of companies, including Global Trust Bank (GTB) and Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank (MMCB). The JPC found him to have played a major role in rigging the prices of a set of ten Indian companies, from 1995 up to 2001. This resulted in Parekh's first conviction, which carried a one-year sentence, coming as a result of a transaction he conducted involving a unit of Canara Bank in 1992. Though Parekh was subsequently barred from stock trading, the Securities and Exchange Board of India alleged in 2009 that a variety of companies and other actors were trading on behalf of Parekh. An investigation ensued and 26 entities were banned from trading as a result of that investigation. In March 2014 he was convicted by a special CBI court in Mumbai for cheating and sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment. ==See also== *Harshad Mehta Scam *Rakesh Jhunjhunwala ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Mumbai Category:Indian stock traders ","title":"Ketan Parekh"},{"id":"2000621","text":"The politics of the Oak Ridges Moraine in southern Ontario, Canada, have centred on the question of how to preserve this extensive natural resource that is increasingly threatened by human modification. Although preservation of the moraine was first suggested in the 1940s, and intermittently over the subsequent fifty years, it was not until 1991 that the issue achieved prominence in political discourse. For the ensuing decade, use of the moraine was hotly contested between the interests of local residents, developers and environmentalists. On December 14, 2001 legislation was enacted, along with a provincial land use plan for the Oak Ridges Moraine. However, it seems clear that regulation, alone, is insufficient to preserving these valuable lands. Implementing the plan has required \\"political will, an engaged and informed public, and... broad based private and public partnerships.\\" Monitoring of the Moraine project by citizens and environmental organizations, along with credible ecological information are essential to its continued preservation. ==Political action== The Oak Ridges Moraine began to come to public awareness in the late 1980s. The establishment, in 1989, of the Save the Oak Ridges Moraine (STORM) Coalition contributed to a growing sense among local residents that action needed to be taken to save the moraine. The Government of Ontario created the Oak Ridges Moraine Technical Working Committee in June 1991 with the joint membership of the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs. The STORM Coalition played a significant role in the Committee's work. The committee's aim was to create a regional planning strategy to coordinate the activities of various regional and municipal governments with jurisdiction over parts of the moraine. This multi-stakeholder process produced a comprehensive long-term strategy for the Moraine in 1994. However the strategy was subsequently dismissed in favour of local government administration of the affected lands. This led to intense development on some portions of the moraine. Most of this development was suburban detached single-family dwellings with road networks to accommodate them. In particular, Vaughan, Richmond Hill and Newmarket experienced significant growth in the 1990s. In early 1999, the Oak Ridges Moraine became a sensitive political issue; developers targeted Richmond Hill for large subdivisions on the moraine, which would house over 100,000 people. Environmental groups began a media campaign to raise public awareness of the moraine, referring to it as the \\"rain barrel of Ontario\\". Public opposition to the developments grew quickly, and the issue was transferred to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) in 2000. Environmentalists, often critical of the OMB for allegedly fast-tracking developments over the concerns of municipal governments, again raised the issue in the media. The dispute remained unresolved until May 2001, when the provincial Conservative government announced a six-month moratorium on moraine development. A panel was formed to create a land-use plan consistent with the current Smart Growth policy. The plan was released in October 2001, and was both praised and condemned. It became the basis for the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, dividing the area into four zones of increasingly stringent controls on development. Under the Act, only eight percent of the moraine can be developed, and only in lands designated as \\"settlement areas\\". ==The Bayview Avenue extension== Throughout the process, debate continued about the extension of Bayview Avenue from Stouffville Road, in Richmond Hill, to Bloomington Road in Aurora. The land on which the extension would pass had been clear-cut in 1999, after the Government of Ontario Ministry of Environment approved the extension in 1998. The road's construction began in September 2001, though environmental groups had entered into legal procedures to block it. The Ontario Court of Appeals rejected the request; York Region officials agreed to resolve some of the concerns that were raised. As a result, a bridge was added to the plan, spanning a 70 m section of a dry ravine near Stouffville Road. Moreover, five salamander tunnels were added to the design, and were built in September 2002. The Bayview extension was officially opened on November 18, 2002. ==North Pickering Land Exchange== During the provincial election of 2003, the Liberal Party of Ontario promised to terminate development on the moraine as part of its election campaign. Once elected, the party failed to deliver on that promise, as a development in the northern part of Richmond Hill consisting of over 6600 housing units continued. The government, in its attempt to halt other nearby developments, proposed the North Pickering Land Exchange. Discussed as early as November 2001, it involved exchanging government-owned public lands in North Pickering for privately owned lands on the Oak Ridges Moraine in Richmond Hill and Uxbridge. The exchange settled outstanding disputes being considered by the OMB involving moraine lands in Richmond Hill and Uxbridge. Lands acquired by the developers had been previously identified as high-growth urban areas in regional and local Official Plans, often referred to as Seaton. However, the process by which the exchange was settled angered environmentalists, who considered the lack of transparency in the process a betrayal: Josh Matlow, founder of Earthroots, accused the Tories of making a \\"sleazy, secret, sweetheart deal\\" with developers. Moreover, the swap allowed the development of 600 acres (2.4 km²) on the moraine; the northern Richmond Hill development ceased operations for several days after the 2003 election, but resumed soon thereafter. The development of MacLeod's Landing, as it is now known, was completed in late 2005. One of the developers, Brookfield Homes, had used the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan as a marketing device, claiming that \\"as one of the last approved developments on the Oak Ridges Moraine, rest assured that the preservation of the natural landscape that surrounds you is forever.\\" The other developers of the community were Kaitlin Group and Aspen Ridge Homes. The site was desirable for development because of the presence of Phillips Lake and a dozen other small kettle lakes, regular features throughout the Oak Ridges Moraine. ==The Big Pipe== :See also King City: The Big Pipe. The political struggle regarding the moraine continues. The community of King City in King Township has been embroiled in a decade-long argument about replacing septic systems with a sewerage connection to the Durham-York Sewage System. Proponents of the link claim that the septic systems leak, endangering the subterranean aquifers of the moraine. Opponents claim that such a link would enable explosive growth in the small community, which would be detrimental to the preservation of the moraine. Construction of the link began in early 2005, creating the main sewer trunk from King City to Oak Ridges along King Road, connecting to the existing system near Yonge Street. The connection to King City, despite the appellation Big Pipe, is relatively small compared to the overall system expansion governed by York Region, which has also been labeled The Big Pipe. The construction of this north-south extension to the system requires daily pumping of 30 million litres of water from subterranean aquifers, over its projected five-year construction schedule (lasting to early 2008). This has upset environmentalists greatly, and disturbed some residents of Markham who rely on wells as their source of water. These residents were the first to be affected by construction because of their proximity to the initial area of development. The $800 million project is divided into several phases, creating fourteen new links in the system. The system trunks, consisting of 2.7 metre concrete pipes, will collectively transport 740 million litres of raw sewage daily from York and Durham to treatment facilities in Pickering. On October 2, 2004, the province ordered a full environmental assessment of the Southeast Collector (in the Rouge Valley) and the Upper Leslie Trunk; a further 44 environmental conditions were placed on four other links in the new system. When complete, the regional Big Pipe will extend from the eastern edge of Lake Simcoe in the north, to treatment plants near Lake Ontario in the south, running along Leslie Street. It will twin with the near-capacity Yonge Street trunk, increasing capacity sufficiently to serve the region's growth until 2030. Intended to cover major growth areas in the eastern part of the region, it will connect directly to emerging developments from Markham to Holland Landing. Moreover, new connections to rural communities will be created; King City is connected to the existing system, whereas Stouffville will connect to the new pipe. Construction of the extensions have been contentious. York Region has been accused of failing to conduct a proper environmental assessment for the expansion. Ontario's environmental commissioner Gord Miller noted such concerns: \\"One of the most significant problems with this project is the lack of a full environmental assessment. Officials never looked at the full picture and the impact it has on the Oak Ridges Moraine and surrounding communities.\\" As pumping of the aquifers continued throughout 2002, residents in nearby areas complained about dropping water levels in their wells, as well as dirty water; the range of affected areas increased with the total volume of water pumped from the aquifer, some as far away as 10 km. Environmentalists claim that continued pumping may jeopardize the aquifer system, so much so that it may reverse its flow in some areas. York Region's planners counter that by indicating that all water that is pumped is re-introduced into nearby streams after being warmed (aquifer water from 50 m below ground level is very cold), and will not affect the aquifer system. Unfortunately, there is no scientific evidence for either claim. Environmentalists have observed, though, that water isn't heated evenly, often resulting in the scalding and death of many fish. Also, according to The Globe and Mail, \\"York Region has acknowledged that the first phase of building the 16th Avenue sewer line, finished in 2003, had a negative impact on local watersheds.\\" In late October 2005, Toronto City Council voted 34-3 to join an environmental coalition attempting to block the construction of the extension. The city, southern neighbour to York Region, allocated $100,000 to conduct a study of the impact of the system on the city's watersheds, specifically the Rouge River Valley, and requested the provincial Environment Minister to defer the approval for construction until the study is complete. ==Lessons learned in watershed preservation== The action to save the moraine yields insights into the state of sustainable land use planning and smart growth in watershed protection. In its 2002 case study, the International Association for Great Lakes Research noted that it was “only through citizen initiatives, shaped and focused by environmental groups, that serious debate, and eventual formation of a land use plan, took place.\\" As the struggle to save the moraine shows, significant political pressure is necessary to overcome the obstacles to controls: municipalities dedicated to encouraging growth and higher level governments reluctant to intervene. The importance of access to good science and policy information is crucial, as is the need for ongoing monitoring and vigilance.\\" ==NotesReferences== *The STORM Coalition *Revised Statutes of Ontario. 2001.

It was propounded in the works entitled In Ismaelis Bullialdi astro-nomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis (Oxford, 1653), against the cosmology of Ismael Boulliau, and Astronomia geometrica (London, 1656) on the system of Kepler.http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/pages/11-ResearchProjects/boulliau/06rp- b-a-bio.htm About this time he was engaged in a decades-long philosophical controversy with Thomas Hobbes: Seth Ward and John Wallis, both Savilian professors and members of the Anglican clergy, felt offended by the works of Hobbes, particularly after Leviathan was released. A small part of the debate with John Webster launched by the Vindiciae academiarum he wrote with John Wilkins which also incorporated an attack on William Dell.Allen G. Debus, Science and Education in the Seventeenth Century: The Webster-Ward Debate (1970). He was one of the original members of the Royal Society of London. In 1659, he was appointed President of Trinity College, Oxford, but not having the statutory qualifications he resigned in 1660. ==Churchman== King Charles II appointed him to the livings of St Lawrence Jewry in London, and Uplowman in Devonshire, in 1661. He also became dean of Exeter Cathedral (1661) and rector of St Breock, Cornwall in 1662. In the latter year he was consecrated Bishop of Exeter, and in 1667 he was translated to the see of Salisbury. The office of Chancellor of the Order of the Garter was conferred on him in 1671. In his diocese he showed great severity to nonconformists, and rigidly enforced the act prohibiting conventicles (unofficial religious meetings). He spent a great deal of money on the restoration of the cathedrals of Worcester and Salisbury. He died at Knightsbridge on 6 January 1689. In 2017 Bishop Wordsworth's Grammar School named its new, fifth house (Ward House) after Bishop Ward. ==ReferencesAttribution=== * * ==External links== * * * Category:1617 births Category:1689 deaths Category:People from Hertfordshire Category:Alumni of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge Category:English astronomers Category:Deans of Exeter Category:Bishops of Exeter Category:Bishops of Salisbury Category:Fellows of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge Category:Original Fellows of the Royal Society Category:17th-century English mathematicians Category:17th-century Anglican bishops Category:Savilian Professors of Astronomy Category:Chancellors of the Order of the Garter ","title":"Seth Ward (bishop of Salisbury)"},{"id":"2000642","text":"Founded in 1928, the Bermuda Football Association is the official football (soccer) organization in Bermuda and is in charge of the Bermudian national team.

There are five major areas of exclusion that arise out of the Federal Rules of Evidence (\\"FRE\\"): subsequent remedial measures, ownership of liability insurance, offers to plead guilty to a crime, offers to settle a claim, and offers to pay medical expenses. Many states have modified versions of the FRE under their own state evidence codes which widen or narrow the public policy exclusions in state courts. The exclusionary rule, under which evidence gathered by the police from an illegal search is excluded, is of similar operation but is typically considered separately. ==Subsequent remedial measures== A subsequent remedial measure is an improvement, repair, or safety measure made after an injury has occurred. FRE 407 prohibits the admission of evidence of subsequent remedial measures to show defendant's (1) negligence; (2) culpable conduct; (3) a defect in defendant's product; (4) defect in the design of defendant's product; or (5) the need for a warning or instruction. Evidence of subsequent remedial measures are generally inadmissible for two reasons. First, courts do not want to discourage defendants from taking steps that further safety. Second, excluding subsequent remedial measures from evidence avoids having to give juries the difficult task of distinguishing between defendant's due care prior to plaintiff's injury, and defendant's due care subsequent to plaintiff's injury. Subsequent remedial measures are, however, admissible into evidence for # witness impeachment purposes # proving defendant's ownership of the instrumentality that injured the plaintiff, if ownership is disputed # proving defendant's control of the instrumentality that injured the plaintiff, if control is disputed # proving the feasibility of undertaking precautionary measures, if feasibility is disputed Example: In a slip and fall claim where plaintiff falls on the wooden steps leading into a building, defendant decides, as the ambulance is taking plaintiff to the hospital, to quickly sand down the stairs where plaintiff injured herself. FRE 407 prohibits plaintiff from introducing evidence of this subsequent remedial measure to prove that the steps were hazardous at the time of her injury. If defendant says that he did not own the building where the plaintiff fell, and plaintiff disputes this claim, plaintiff may introduce evidence that the defendant sanded the stairs to show that defendant did, in fact, own the property on which the steps are located at the time her injury occurred. If defendant claims that there was nothing he could have done to make the steps safer at the time of plaintiff's slip and fall, and plaintiff disputes this allegation, plaintiff may introduce evidence of the subsequent remedial measure to prove that undertaking precautionary measures was, in fact, feasible. * Note that in California, California Evidence Code (\\"CEC\\") §1151 designates as inadmissible evidence of subsequent remedial measures only if it is being offered to prove (1) negligence or (2) culpable conduct; California state courts, therefore, have abandoned the exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures when being used to prove defects in defendant's product or design of defendant's product, or to prove that there was a need for a warning or instruction. ==Ownership of liability insurance== Evidence of a party's ownership of—or lack of ownership of—liability insurance is inadmissible to prove (1) negligence or (2) wrongful conduct because courts do not want to discourage parties from carrying such insurance. FRE 411 states: :Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness. The rule spells out four exceptions to the rule of inadmissibility: evidence of a party's ownership of liability insurance—or of a party's failure to own liability insurance—is admissible to prove (1) a witness' bias or prejudice, i.e. for witness impeachment; (2) agency; (3) ownership; and (4) control. #If the owner of the insurance policy disputes ownership or control of the property, for instance, evidence of liability insurance can be introduced to show that it is likely that the owner of the policy probably does own or control the property. #If a witness has an interest in the policy that gives the witness a motive or bias with respect to specific testimony, the existence of the policy can be introduced to show this motive or bias. Federal rules of civil procedure rule 26 was amended in 1993 to require that any insurance policy that may pay or may reimburse be made available for photocopying by the opposing litigants, although the policies are not normally information given to the jury. Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure rule 46 says that an appeal can be dismissed or affirmed if counsel does not update their notice of appearance to acknowledge insurance. The Cornell University Legal Institute web site includes congressional notes. Additionally, an exception arises where the party's mention of its own liability insurance is inextricably intertwined with another statement that is admissible. For example, if after an automobile accident, the driver of one car runs over to the other and says \\"don't worry, my insurance will pay to fix the damage I caused to your car\\", the entire statement is admissible not to show that the driver is insured, but that the driver has admitted fault. * Note that in California, California Evidence Code (\\"CEC\\") §1155 provides that evidence of a party's whole or part ownership of liability insurance is inadmissible to prove (1) negligence or (2) other wrongdoing. The statute does not include total lack of ownership of liability insurance, which may thus be used to prove that defendant did not exercise due care. ==Offers to plead guilty to a crime== FRE 410 holds that (1) withdrawn guilty pleas; (2) nolo contendere pleas; (3) statements made during proceedings regarding guilty pleas; (4) statements made during proceedings regarding nolo contendere pleas; (5) and statements made during plea discussions with an attorney present are inadmissible for public policy reasons even if they are relevant. The motivation behind excluding such pleas from evidence is to encourage plea bargaining. Two FRE-contained exceptions apply to this rule: criminal pleas, plea discussions, and related statements are admissible (i) in any proceeding where another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussion has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel. Additionally, a criminal defendant may waive inadmissibility protections, rendering criminal pleas, plea discussions, and related statements admissible at trial. It is a common practice for prosecutors drawing up plea deals to include terms requiring the defendant to agree that statements made in the course of plea negotiations may be used to impeach the testimony of that defendant, to protect against the possibility of the defendant later changing her story. * Note that if a defendant chooses not to withdraw her guilty plea, this is an admission by a party opponent and may be admitted into evidence in subsequent civil proceedings. ==Offers to settle a claim== Offers to settle a claim, and related statements made during a settlement conference, are generally inadmissible under FRE 408. The primary public policy motivation is to encourage litigants to settle their disputes. This rule also recognizes that parties may make settlement offers even where they believe they have no actual liability, in order to avoid the expense of litigation. A 2006 amendment to the rule permits the admission of statements made during settlement discussions between a private party and a regulatory body, when those statements are offered as evidence in a criminal case, subject to FRE 403. The inadmissibility of settlement claims only prohibits the admission of statements, not the admission of facts. Thus, if a party to a settlement conference mentions that she possesses a certain document relevant to the proceedings, the other party may seek to discover that document through legal processes, despite it having first been mentioned in the settlement conference; merely disclosing a document's existence and mentioning it during a settlement conference does not insulate it from being discovered and admitted. Additionally, the public policy exception of excluding relevant evidence arising out of an offer to settle cannot not apply if the evidence sought to be introduced is a claim made in a period before a dispute between the parties arose. :Example: Florida-based piano teacher P gets her expensive, snow white tile floors polished by North Carolina-based cleaning company C on March 22. C mails P a bill for $100,000 on March 29. P thought that the service would only cost $75,000.00, and disputes the $100,000 charge. Unable to come to a compromise with P, C brings suit on May 8 in federal court to collect $200,000. FRE 408 does not prohibit P's introduction of the $100,000 March bill into evidence as an admission by C that the total amount disputed cannot exceed $100,000. ==Offers to pay medical expenses== An offer to pay medical expenses is an offer of this nature made by a party who might potentially be liable for an injury to another is inadmissible despite its relevance. FRE 409 states: :Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury. Evidence of an offer to pay medical expenses is inadmissible for the public policy rationale that courts do not want to discourage parties responsible for injuring others from paying for the treatment of those injuries. Statements made in connection with offers to pay medical expenses, however, are not excluded by FRE 409. :Example: Plaintiff P slices her lip on a shard of glass that somehow made its way into a salad prepared in defendant D's restaurant. D later visits P in the hospital, puts a bouquet of sunflowers on the table next to the bed where P is sobbing in pain, and exclaims,\\"I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault! Please don't worry about your expenses for this hospital visit, I'll write you a check for whatever your bills add up to.\\" In a subsequent personal injury suit brought by P against D in federal court, P may introduce D's statement \\"I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault!\\" as an admission of fault by D. * Note that in California, California Evidence Code (\\"CEC\\") §1152(a) renders both offers to pay medical expenses as well as \\"statements made in negotiation thereof\\" inadmissible to prove liability. In the above example, therefore, a CA court would prohibit P's introduction of not only the \\"Please don't worry about your expenses for this hospital visit, I'll write you a check for whatever your bills add up to\\" statement, but also the \\"I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault\\" statement. ==Mediation proceedings: a California-specific rule== California law excludes from evidence and discovery relevant statements made \\"for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation or a mediation consultation\\" through California Evidence Code (\\"CEC\\") §§1115-1125, for the public policy purpose of encouraging the resolution of legal conflicts by mediation. ==Exclusionary rule== The exclusionary rule is another rule under which relevant evidence may be excluded, based in part on public policy concerns. It causes evidence gathered by the police from an illegal search to be inadmissible in a criminal case. The exclusion is intended, in part, to discourage law enforcement officials from violating the search subject's constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure. However, it is premised as much on the right of the individual accused against such a search as it is on the larger issue of law enforcement behavior. The rule does also reflect on questions of reliability regarding some (but not all) types of evidence that are excluded thereunder. For example, an officer conducting a warrantless search may have more of an opportunity to plant evidence, and a confession coerced out of a party denied access to legal counsel may be false. In legal education and discourse, the exclusionary rule is generally treated as a rule of criminal procedure, rather than a rule of evidence. ==External links== *Federal Rule 407, Cornell Law School notes *Federal Rule 408, Cornell Law School notes *Federal Rule 409, Cornell Law School notes *Federal Rule 410, Cornell Law School notes *Federal Rule 411, Cornell Law School notes *California Evidence Code §§1151 (subsequent remedial measures); 1152(a) (offers to pay medical expenses); and 1155 (liability insurance) *California Evidence Code §§1115-1125 (statements made in mediation proceedings) Category:Evidence law Category:Public policy ","title":"Public policy doctrines for the exclusion of relevant evidence"},{"id":"2000647","text":"New Sweden ca. 1650. Fort Nya Elfsborg was a fortification and settlement established as a part of New Sweden. Built in 1643 and named after the Älvsborg Fortress off Gothenburg, Fort Nya Elfsborg was located on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River, between present day Salem and Alloway Creek. Fort Elfsborg (New Netherlands Project) ==History== At the time of European colonization in the 17th century, the Delaware was known as the South River and the Salem River was known as Varkens Kill, or Hogg Creek. The Dutch established a factorij at Fort Nassau on the east bank of the South River in 1626, and claimed the territory as part of New Netherland. Despite the claim, the colony of New Sweden was founded, in 1638, at Fort Christina on the west bank. In 1641, without having a patent, a group of 60 settlers (20 families) from the New Haven Colony (in today's Connecticut) purchased land along the kill and the Schuylkill from indigenous Lenape. In 1643, the Dutch forcibly disbanded their trading post on the Schuylkill opposite their fort. Fort Nya Elfsborg was built shortly after Johan Printz, governor of New Sweden, arrived in the colony on 15 February 1643, allowing the Varkens Kill settlement to remain if they swore allegiance to Sweden. He also built Fort Nya Gothenborg on Tinicum Island (to the immediate SW of today's Philadelphia), where he built his own manor house which he called The Printzhof. Fort Nya Elfsborg had iron and brass 12pd cannons mounted on earth and wooden palisades. It was a Swedish-style three-cornered earthen redoubt with eight guns. Log farmsteads similar to those found in Sweden went up around the fort further downriver, so that Dutch West India Company ships coming up from the bay would have to pass them first. Discover Salem County (Elsinboro Township) At that time, this area of the river was mostly swamp and the soldiers garrisoned there were inundated by mosquitos. Fort Mosquito (Fort Myggenborgh), as it was commonly nicknamed, was eventually abandoned, the soldiers succumbing not to enemy cannon fire, but bites. New Sweden burned down the fort after the Dutch built Fort Casimir across the river in 1651. The actual site of the fort is now under water at Elsinboro Point. In August 2012, archeological surveys were undertaken to locate the precise location and any remains of the fort, without success. There is a black stone monument outside the Elsinboro Township School. The stone block came from an old fortress in Sweden built in the 13th century.Re- Creations of Swedish Colonial Life Begin In Jersey For 1988 Celebration (New York Times, May 3, 1987) Monument Dedicated June 6th 2004 (New Sweden Heritage Monument) ==ReferencesSources== *Johnson, Amandus.

From 1947 it was based in Rusholme, a suburb of Manchester, and produced a number of comedy films, mostly aimed at audiences in the North of England. ==History== Founded by John E. Blakeley, the company produced films in London on extremely low budgets. Blakeley's first studio consisted of a single soundstage in a loft space above a taxi garage. Whenever the filmmakers wanted to shoot a scene, they would first have to signal the mechanics below to stop working, so the noise from below wouldn't register on the soundtracks. Blakeley's first production was Boots! Boots! (1934), starring the young variety entertainer George Formby. Production values were so low that some scenes were filmed in semi-darkness, to hide the lack of set decorations. Despite the technical flaws, the debut film was a huge success in the local provinces, recouping Blakeley's investment several times over and launching George Formby as Britain's leading screen comedian. Within the year \\"Blakeley's Productions, Ltd.\\" had become \\"The Mancunian Film Distributors, Ltd\\". Blakeley initially used facilities like Riverside Studios; the films were released via Butcher's Films. ===Dickenson Road Studios=== A plaque on a house wall marks the former site of Dickenson Road Studios Escalating costs and a desire to cater for the robust tastes of northern industrial audiences led to the establishment of the two-stage facility in a former Methodist Chapel on Dickenson Road, Rusholme, the only film studio outside the South East. The buildings were converted at a cost of £70,000 in 1947. Starting with Cup-tie Honeymoon (1948) starring Sandy Powell, over the next six years the films went on to feature northern favourites Frank Randle, Josef Locke, Diana Dors, and Jimmy Clitheroe. The studio, though it often worked on a shoestring, was successful and profitable but Blakely decided to retire when he reached 65. Mancunian Films continued under Blakeley's son Tom for many years, providing facilities for Hammer Horror and making a number of B-movies. The cinematographic expertise developed in Manchester formed the foundations of Granada Television. In the 1950s, the growing popularity of television represented competition with cinema, and as the mass media market evolved, numerous film studios were taken over by emerging television broadcasters. In London, the BBC acquired Lime Grove Studios from Gainsborough Pictures in 1949, and Ealing Studios in 1955. Dickenson Road Studios was bought from Mancunian by the BBC in 1954, and it became the first regional BBC Television studio outside London. Programmes made by the BBC at the studios included series starring comedian Harry Worth and variety programmes. Notably, the first episode of the pop music television show Top of the Pops was broadcast from Dickenson Road Studio on 1 January 1964, presented by Jimmy Savile and opening with The Rolling Stones performing \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\". The studios remained the home of Top of the Pops until 1967, when the show moved to a larger facility at Lime Grove Studios in London. The Dickenson Road building was demolished in 1975 when operations were transferred to the BBC's new building at New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road. ===Mancunian Films Library=== Mancunian Films Library, in storage at Kay Laboratories, was lost in a fire in 1980.

A masthead rig has the advantage of not needing them. A running backstay runs from each lateral corner of the stern to the mast at the level where the forestay begins in the fractional rig. Together with other rigging, it supports the mast. Because they are attached low on mast, they can present a significant problem in an accidental gybe, as the boom hits the stay, with the possibility of breaking the boom, mast, or both. During beating or reaching, the running backstay in windward side is in tension. The one in the leeward side is lazy. As the boat tacks they change over. Another function of the running backstay is to adjust the tension of the forestay to suit the sailing angle and sea condition. In general, during a hard beat when the boat sails very close to the wind, the running backstay is tightened to increase the tension of the forestay. The genoa is sheeted in. Under these conditions, the draft of the genoa is brought forward reducing the drag.

The area code is anchored by Virginia's capital, Richmond, and includes most of its metropolitan area. Other communities using 804 include Chesterfield, Henrico, Hopewell, Mechanicsville, Powhatan, Midlothian, Petersburg, and Colonial Heights. The 804 code also includes the Northern Neck and the Middle Peninsula. The two southernmost counties on the Middle Peninsula, Gloucester and Mathews, are part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, but use 804 instead of the area code 757 used by the rest of Hampton Roads. Area code 804 was split from Virginia's original area code, area code 703, on Sunday, June 24, 1973, with an official permissive dialing period ending January 1, 1974.\\"NANP Area Code History: 1970 - 1979,\\" from areacode-info.com Originally, it stretched across the eastern two-thirds of the state, from Danville to the Eastern Shore. Normally, when an area code is split, the largest city in the old numbering plan area retains the old area code–in this case, Norfolk, then Virginia's largest city. However, C&P; Telephone (now part of Verizon) wanted to keep the large number of federal agencies in Northern Virginia from having to change their numbers. Despite the rapid growth of the Richmond-Petersburg and Hampton Roads areas, this configuration remained in place for 23 years. On July 1, 1996, the Eastern Shore and most of Hampton Roads became area code 757. Although Hampton Roads is the largest metropolitan area based in the Commonwealth, Bell Atlantic (forerunner of Verizon) decided to let Richmond keep 804 in order to spare the plethora of state agencies in the capital the expense and burden of having to change their numbers. This split was intended as a long-term solution, but by the turn of the century and millennium 804 was running out of numbers due to the rapid growth of the Richmond area, as well as the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. As a result, 804 was split again on June 1, 2001, when most of the western portion (Danville, Lynchburg, Charlottesville) became area code 434. Area code 804 is famous for being the only one created during what is considered the most stable time of NANPA's existence, from 1966-1982. Despite Richmond's continued growth, the area will not need another area code until late 2025.https://www.nationalnanpa.com/reports/2018-2_NPA_Exhaust_Projections_Final.pdf ==See also== *List of Virginia area codes *List of NANP area codes *North American Numbering Plan ==ReferencesExternal links== * List of exchanges from AreaCodeDownload.com, 804 Area Code 804 Category:Richmond, Virginia 804 Category:1973 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Area code 804"},{"id":"2000668","text":"Long form or longform may refer to: *A variety of improvisational theatre *A type of census questionnaire *Form 1040, an American income tax form *Long form journalism ==See also== *Short form (disambiguation) ","title":"Long form"},{"id":"2000672","text":"Henri Caillavet (2 June 1914 – 27 February 2013) was a French political figure most prominent during the post-war years 1946–1958, when, during the Fourth Republic, he was a member of the National Assembly and as a Senator from 1967–1985.

Such character evidence is generally inadmissible. Federal Rule of Evidence 406 states, \\"Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of an eyewitness, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice\\".

A recognized gender identity/gender role in traditional Samoan society, and an integral part of Samoan culture, faʻafafine are assigned male at birth, and explicitly embody both masculine and feminine gender traits in a way unique to Polynesia. Their behaviour typically ranges from extravagantly feminine to conventionally masculine. A prominent Western theory, among the many anthropological theories about Samoans, was that if a family had more boys than girls or not enough girls to help with women's duties about the house, male children would be chosen to be raised as faʻafafine; although this theory has been refuted by studies. It has been estimated that 1–5% of Samoans identify as faʻafafine. Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand estimates that there are 500 faʻafafine in Samoa, and the same number in the Samoan diaspora in New Zealand; while according to SBS news, there are up to 3000 faʻafafine currently living in Samoa. == History and terminology == The word faʻafafine includes the causative prefix faʻa–, meaning \\"in the manner of\\", and the word fafine, meaning \\"woman\\".Milner, G.B. 1966. Samoan-English Dictionary. \\"Faʻafafine\\" entry pg. 52 under \\"Fafine\\" It is cognate with linguistically related words or social categories in other Polynesian languages, such as the Tongan fakaleiti (also fakafefine), the Cook Islands Māori akavaʻine, the Hawaiian and Tahitian māhū (literally in the middle), the Māori whakawāhine, the Niuean fiafifine (also fakafifine), the Tokelauan fakafāfine, the Tuvaluan pinapinaaine, the Gilbertese binabinaaine, and the Wallisian fakafafine. The FTM or female-to- male equivalent in Samoa are known variously as faʻatane, faʻatama, and fafatama. Ultimately, Western terms like gay, transgender, FTM, etc., do not align exactly with Samoan terms like faʻafafine, faʻatane, etc., which have meaning within the faʻasamoa traditional cultural systems of Samoa. The Samoan slang word mala (or \\"devastation\\" in the Samoan language) is in less frequent use for faʻafafine, as it arose from fundamentalist influenced homophobia and transphobia. The history of faʻafafine, through the elisions of colonialism, is difficult to trace. Nafanua, the female warrior and chief of Samoan early history, is often held up as an icon of faʻafafine and faʻatane. In Dolgoy's recorded interviews with faʻafafine from the 1980s, we know that Johnny Fruitcake was a popular faʻafafine during the American military occupation of Samoa in World War II, and that Anita (Tony Schwenke) was the founder of Hollywood, a tailoring shop and house of refuge for faʻafafine in Apia in the 1960s–1970s. Beginning in the 1980s, through the Samoan diaspora, faʻafafine began having a presence in contemporary global cultures. == Role in Samoan society == Faʻafafine are known for their hard work and dedication to the family, in the Samoan tradition of tautua or service to family. Ideas of the family in Samoa and Polynesia are markedly different from Western constructions, and include all the members of a sa, or communal family within the faʻamatai family systems.Saleimoa Vaai, Samoa Faa-matai and the Rule of Law (Apia: The National University of Samoa Le Papa-I-Galagala, 1999). Faʻafafine, as a third gender, have sexual relationships almost exclusively with men who do not identify as faʻafafine, and sometimes with women, but apparently not with other faʻafafine. This third gender is so well-accepted in Samoan culture that most Samoans state that they have friendship relationships with at least one faʻafafine; it is, however, not totally accepted in other communities, such as some Catholic groups and traditional leaders. Traditionally, faʻafafine follow the training of the women's daily work in an Aiga (Samoan family group).Danielsson, B., T. Danielsson, and R. Pierson. 1978. Polynesia's third sex: The gay life starts in the kitchen. Pacific Islands Monthly 49:10–13. Faʻafafine state that they \\"loved\\" engaging in feminine activities as children, such as playing with female peers, playing female characters during role play, dressing up in female clothes, and playing with female gender-typical toys. This is in contrast to women who stated that they merely \\"liked\\" engaging in those activities as children. Some faʻafafine recall believing they were girls in childhood, but knew better as adults. In Samoa, there is very seldom ridicule or displeasure towards a biologically male child who states that they are a girl. For instance, one study showed only a minority of parents (20 per cent) tried to stop their faʻafafine children from engaging in feminine behavior. Being pushed into the male gender role is upsetting to many faʻafafine. A significant number stated that they \\"hated\\" masculine play, such as rough games and sports, even more than females did as children. ==Society of Faʻafafine in American Samoa and the Samoa Faʻafafine Association== The Society of Faʻafafine in American Samoa or \\"Le Sosaiete o Faʻafafine i Amerika Samoa\\" (S.O.F.I.A.S) is an organization designed to foster collaboration between the faʻafafine and the LGBTQI+ communities in both American Samoa, the Asia Pacific region, and the world. SOFIAS describes itself as an organization dedicated to balancing both Samoan values with western influences and aims to promote a positive attitude toward the Samoan faʻafafine community. Now known as Miss SOFIAS, the Miss Island Queen Pageant has been held in Pago Pago, American Samoa, since 1979. The Samoan Faafafine Association Incorporated (S.F.A.) of independent Samoa, based in Apia, has been active for over a decade. It works closely with government, local churches, and youth organizations, supporting community projects for the faafafine community, but also for elders and youth in Samoa. SFA has been active on the international level working with the United Nations and Pacific regional NGO's, on behalf of the faʻafafine, transgender, and LGBT communities of the Pacific Islands. They also been active working with media developing a more equitable representation of faʻafafine by media. There has been legislative activity initiated in Samoa by the Samoa Faafafine Association, with faafafine lawyers Alex Suʻa and Phineas Hartson Matautia, on issues of LGBT rights in Samoa. Their efforts to repeal homophobic and transphobic laws inherited from the British and New Zealand colonial administrations have met with partial success. Marriage equality for faʻafafine is still unlawful in Samoa; and despite marriage equality legalization in the U.S., it is still not recognized in the US Territory of American Samoa. ==Notable Faʻafafine== * Edward Cowley aka \\"Buckwheat\\" – a drag performer and television personality based in Auckland, worked with New Zealand AIDS Foundation, champion bodybuilder. * Shigeyuki Kihara – a contemporary artist whose work has been featured in numerous museum exhibitions art galleries around the world.

His brother was Virginia Governor John Page. ==Life== John Wollaston, circa 1757 Mann was born to Mann Page II and Ann Corbin Tayloe, daughter of John Tayloe I, (his third wife) at Rosewell Plantation in Gloucester County, Virginia. Mann was one of the younger of seven children. He attended the College of William & Mary before reading law. Page moved to Spotsylvania County and established his own plantation, known as Mannsfield near Fredericksburg, an almost direct replica of Mount Airy, the seat of the Tayloe Family. He married Mary Tayloe and the couple had three children. Around 1735, Page's father's half-sister, Maria Judith Page, married William Randolph III, the son of Thomas Randolph (of Tuckahoe) and the grandson of William Randolph I, and had four children. Page served only one term in the Continental Congress. He defended a slave named Billy who wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson and was sentenced to death by hanging for treason as a result. ==Death and legacy== Mann Page died at home in 1781, and was buried in the family plot at Mannsfield. The plantation was mostly destroyed during the Battle of Fredericksburg in the Civil War, but a remnant remains in the battlefield park. The ruins of Rosewell Plantation, the home of early members of the Page family and one of the finest mansions built in the colonies, sit on the banks of the York River in Gloucester County. In 1916, a fire swept the mansion leaving a magnificent shell which is testament to 18th century craftsmanship and dreams, and the site of ongoing archaeological studies. ==See also== * John Page (Middle Plantation) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Biographic sketch at U.S. Congress website Category:1749 births Category:1781 deaths Category:Continental Congressmen from Virginia Category:18th-century American politicians Category:Virginia lawyers Mann Page Category:People from Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:American colonial people Category:American people of English descent Category:American planters Category:College of William & Mary alumni Category:American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law Category:Tayloe family of Virginia ","title":"Mann Page"},{"id":"2000719","text":"The Song of the Lioness is a young adult series of fantasy novels published in the 1980s by Tamora Pierce. The series consists of four books: Alanna: The First Adventure (1983), In the Hand of the Goddess (1984), The Woman Who Rides Like a Man (1986) and Lioness Rampant (1988). ==Plot summary== Noblewoman Alanna of Trebond, disguised as the boy \\"Alan\\", exchanges places with her twin brother Thom, to go to the royal palace in the city of Corus to train for knighthood, while Thom studies magic. Throughout the four novels Alanna struggles with her gender identity, as well as going through puberty and bullying. Alanna befriends characters of a wide background during the quartet including George, the commoner king of the thieves; the scholar Sir Myles of Olau; senior students Gareth (Gary) of Naxen, Raoul of Goldenlake, and Prince Jonathan of Conté; Princess Thayet of Sarain; Liam Ironarm, a martial-arts champion; and Buriram (Buri) Tourakom, Thayet's bodyguard. Her principal rivals are classmate Ralon of Malven and Jonathan's kinsman Duke Roger. In the second volume, Alanna also acquires the magical cat 'Faithful', who accompanies her thereafter (Faithful is hinted to be an immortal, but his origins remain unknown. Because of her double identity as a girl masquerading as a boy, small size, magic, and impatience, Alanna often questions her own character. In the third book, she becomes an honorary member of the 'Bazhir' (a Bedouin-like ethnicity) and gains acceptance as a warrior, mage and a woman. In the final volume, Alanna becomes King's Champion to Jonathan and Baroness of the coastal estate Pirate's Swoop.\\" == Characters == *Alanna of Trebond: The protagonist of the series: a noble-born, stubborn tomboy with bright, violet eyes and a wicked temper, but capable of earning loyalty and friendship. She is the first female knight in centuries in the land of Tortall, after disguising herself as a boy throughout her training. *Thom of Trebond: Alanna's twin: a powerful magician, but often arrogant and prideful. Fellow-conspirator in creating 'Alan', Alanna's alter-ego. *Coram Smythesson: Alanna's bodyguard, loyal servant, and lifelong caretaker; a former soldier and Alanna's fellow conspirator in hiding her true gender. He later marries Rispah, George’s cousin and part of the Corus criminal underworld. *George Cooper: A clairvoyant thief, trickster, and fighter who controls the capital city's criminal population as the King of Thieves; Alanna's friend, and periodically her lover; ultimately commissioned 'Baron of Pirate's Swoop' by King Jonathan, and (at the end of the last volume) married to Alanna. *Rispah Cooper: George's cousin and assistant, head of the Corus flower sellers; later Coram's wife; cheerful, decisive, and compassionate. *Jonathan of Conté: The crown prince of the kingdom Tortall; a ring-leader among the students trained in the capital. Alanna's friend, sponsor, and periodic lover; also an ally cultivated by George. Intelligent, handsome, charismatic, and decisive. *Gareth of Naxen the Younger (Gary): Jonathan's unofficial second-in-command among the students; a whimsical and sharp-tongued but intelligent character, and Alanna's closest friend. *Raoul of Goldenlake: A fellow-student of Jonathan and Gary's; Alanna's friend; large, taciturn, and shy. *Alex of Tirragen: A fellow-student of Goldenlake's; at first Alanna's friend, but later her rival. Slain by her in the final book. *Ralon of Malven: A fellow- student of Jonathan's. Established a spiteful rivalry with Alanna, and left the palace in shame after she beat him in a fight. He later became involved with the Court of the Rogue under the name 'Claw,' and was eventually slain by George Cooper. *Thayet jian Wilima (Later Thayet the Peerless or Thayet of Conté): An exiled Saren princess befriended by Alanna; later married to Jonathan; a deft horsewoman and archer. Graceful, intelligent, confident, and compassionate. Regarded as the most beautiful woman in the world. *Buriram Tourakom (Buri): Thayet's fiercely loyal bodyguard; later Raoul's amorous interest during the (Protector of the Small series), and wife (in the Daughter of the Lioness Series.) *Liam Ironarm: A martial-arts champion, called the Shang Dragon, who attaches himself to Alanna, alternately as lover and instructor. Slain by her enemies defending the Tortallan crown. *Duke Roger of Conté: Prince Jonathan's cousin and would-be usurper: suspected by Alanna in the first book, killed by her in the second, absent from the third, and resurrected in the fourth, wherein he is again killed by Alanna. == Themes  Gender === Pierce expresses the concept that boys and girls are alike. Our education system has a huge impact on boys and girls to modify themselves. Thus we should lead them to be what they want rather than constrain their creativity or put them into stereotypes which has been set by adult society. When it comes to adult society, Pierce points out that women's competence and contribution should be valued and respected. Because of gender inequity, women's contributions are often ignored, which is quite common in our society. She strongly calls for help to build a more fair and balanced society for men and women, boys and girls. The series covers the life and development Alanna as she disguises herself as a male and has to exist in life as a male. This causes a lot of gender discussion as in the first book it is easy for her to disguise herself as a boy as she is still prepubescent. But in her first year of training to be a knight, Alanna goes through puberty and gets her first period. This causes quite a bit of discourse in Alanna as she struggles to identify herself as a female while living as a boy. While she does come out to a select close few as female sometimes intentionally and other times not, she does still struggle with it, even as they encourage her to explore both sides she has available to her. This theme is one of the reasons the series received such a high feminist regard as it was very open and honest towards the female body and its limitations versus being able to push oneself beyond that. In 2019, Pierce posted on Twitter that \\"Alanna has always defied labels. She took the best bits of being a woman and a man, and created her own unique identity. I think the term is 'gender-fluid', though there wasn't a word for this (to my knowledge) when I was writing her.\\" === Bullying === The series as a whole pays attention to the struggles Alanna has due to her small frame, or her magic abilities. The first book she spends half of it being beaten up by a bully and his friends. This theme being played up in the series has been a big part towards the use of these novels in classes as it teaches some of the faults towards bullying and what is wrong with it and why this book is worth teaching. ==Books== # Alanna: The First Adventure # In the Hand of the Goddess #The Woman Who Rides Like a Man # Lioness Rampant == Awards and Honors == * Margaret A.

Tamora Pierce is said to have turned to writing at a young age as a means of escape from a troubled family life. Pierce drew much of her inspiration from other fantasy series such as The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. Pierce set out to not only create an epic fantasy adventure, but to populate it with a strong female protagonist. Pierce saw the need for a female protagonist in the significant lacking of such heroes in the fantasy novels she enjoyed as a child, often stating that she wrote what she as a young-adult would have enjoyed. Originally, Pierce had written her acclaimed quartet as a single adult novel but, following editorial advice, rewrote it into the now famous young-adult fantasy series. Pierce has said that she based the character of Alanna on her sister. Kunzel, Bonnie. Tamora Pierce. Greenwood Publishing Group, 01 Jan 2007. == Reception == Pierce's book has been selected Recommended Fantasy List in June 1991, Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults in 2003 and Young Adult Library Services Association by YALSA. Her book has also been nominated south Carolina Children's Book Awards from 1985 to 1986. She has won Bookworm's Prize by ZDF Schüler-Express. ==Publishing information== Alanna: The First Adventure, was first published in 1983 by Atheneum Books, and then Random House Inc. The following books were published in 1984, 1986, and 1988, respectively. The series started out as a 732-page novel titled the Song of the Lioness, but her editor, Jean Karl, thought parts were too inappropriate for children and Tamora Pierce edited it into the present series. ==References== Category:Series of children's books Category:Fantasy novel series 1 The Song of the Lioness ","title":"The Song of the Lioness"},{"id":"2000721","text":"View from the bottom of Butser Hill Queen Elizabeth Country Park is a large country park situated on the South Downs in southern England.

By definition, a gauge theory represents each physically distinct configuration of the system as an equivalence class of detailed local field configurations. Any two detailed configurations in the same equivalence class are related by a gauge transformation, equivalent to a shear along unphysical axes in configuration space. Most of the quantitative physical predictions of a gauge theory can only be obtained under a coherent prescription for suppressing or ignoring these unphysical degrees of freedom. Although the unphysical axes in the space of detailed configurations are a fundamental property of the physical model, there is no special set of directions \\"perpendicular\\" to them. Hence there is an enormous amount of freedom involved in taking a \\"cross section\\" representing each physical configuration by a particular detailed configuration (or even a weighted distribution of them). Judicious gauge fixing can simplify calculations immensely, but becomes progressively harder as the physical model becomes more realistic; its application to quantum field theory is fraught with complications related to renormalization, especially when the computation is continued to higher orders. Historically, the search for logically consistent and computationally tractable gauge fixing procedures, and efforts to demonstrate their equivalence in the face of a bewildering variety of technical difficulties, has been a major driver of mathematical physics from the late nineteenth century to the present. ==Gauge freedom== The archetypical gauge theory is the Heaviside–Gibbs formulation of continuum electrodynamics in terms of an electromagnetic four-potential, which is presented here in space/time asymmetric Heaviside notation. The electric field E and magnetic field B of Maxwell's equations contain only \\"physical\\" degrees of freedom, in the sense that every mathematical degree of freedom in an electromagnetic field configuration has a separately measurable effect on the motions of test charges in the vicinity. These \\"field strength\\" variables can be expressed in terms of the electric scalar potential \\\\varphi and the magnetic vector potential A through the relations: :{\\\\mathbf E} = - abla\\\\varphi - \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\mathbf A}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\,, \\\\quad {\\\\mathbf B} = abla\\\\times{\\\\mathbf A}. If the transformation is made, then B remains unchanged, since :{\\\\mathbf B} = abla\\\\times ({\\\\mathbf A}+ abla \\\\psi) = abla\\\\times{\\\\mathbf A}. However, this transformation changes E according to :{\\\\mathbf E} = - abla\\\\varphi - \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\mathbf A}}{\\\\partial t} - abla \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\psi}}{\\\\partial t} = - abla \\\\left( \\\\varphi + \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\psi}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\mathbf A}}{\\\\partial t}. If another change {\\\\partial t}|}} is made then E also remains the same. Hence, the E and B fields are unchanged if one takes any function and simultaneously transforms A and φ via the transformations () and (). A particular choice of the scalar and vector potentials is a gauge (more precisely, gauge potential) and a scalar function ψ used to change the gauge is called a gauge function. The existence of arbitrary numbers of gauge functions corresponds to the U(1) gauge freedom of this theory. Gauge fixing can be done in many ways, some of which we exhibit below. Although classical electromagnetism is now often spoken of as a gauge theory, it was not originally conceived in these terms. The motion of a classical point charge is affected only by the electric and magnetic field strengths at that point, and the potentials can be treated as a mere mathematical device for simplifying some proofs and calculations. Not until the advent of quantum field theory could it be said that the potentials themselves are part of the physical configuration of a system. The earliest consequence to be accurately predicted and experimentally verified was the Aharonov–Bohm effect, which has no classical counterpart. Nevertheless, gauge freedom is still true in these theories. For example, the Aharonov–Bohm effect depends on a line integral of A around a closed loop, and this integral is not changed by :\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{A} + abla \\\\psi\\\\,. Gauge fixing in non-abelian gauge theories, such as Yang–Mills theory and general relativity, is a rather more complicated topic; for details see Gribov ambiguity, Faddeev–Popov ghost, and frame bundle. ===An illustration=== Gauge fixing of a twisted cylinder. (Note: the line is on the surface of the cylinder, not inside it.) By looking at a cylindrical rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section makes it impossible to tell whether or not it is twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it needs not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant. ==Coulomb gauge== The Coulomb gauge (also known as the transverse gauge) is used in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics and is defined by the gauge condition (more precisely, gauge fixing condition) : abla\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf A}(\\\\mathbf{r},t)=0\\\\,. It is particularly useful for \\"semi-classical\\" calculations in quantum mechanics, in which the vector potential is quantized but the Coulomb interaction is not. The Coulomb gauge has a number of properties: {\\\\partial t} : \\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = abla \\\\times\\\\int\\\\frac{ \\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf{r}',t)}{4\\\\pi R}\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!^3\\\\mathbf{r}'+ abla \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) where is an arbitrary scalar field called the gauge function. The fields that are the derivatives of the gauge function are known as pure gauge fields and the arbitrariness associated with the gauge function is known as gauge freedom. In a calculation that is carried out correctly the pure gauge terms have no effect on any physical observable. A quantity or expression that does not depend on the gauge function is said to be gauge invariant: All physical observables are required to be gauge invariant. A gauge transformation from the Coulomb gauge to another gauge is made by taking the gauge function to be the sum of a specific function which will give the desired gauge transformation and the arbitrary function. If the arbitrary function is then set to zero, the gauge is said to be fixed. Calculations may be carried out in a fixed gauge but must be done in a way that is gauge invariant. }} ==Lorenz gauge== The Lorenz gauge is given, in SI units, by: : abla\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf A} + \\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t}=0 and in Gaussian units by: : abla\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf A} + \\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t}=0. This may be rewritten as: :\\\\partial_{\\\\mu} A^{\\\\mu} = 0. where A^\\\\mu = \\\\left[\\\\,\\\\tfrac{1}{c}\\\\varphi,\\\\,\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\,\\\\right] is the electromagnetic four- potential, ∂μ the 4-gradient [using the metric signature (+, −, −, −)]. It is unique among the constraint gauges in retaining manifest Lorentz invariance. Note, however, that this gauge was originally named after the Danish physicist Ludvig Lorenz and not after Hendrik Lorentz; it is often misspelled \\"Lorentz gauge\\". (Neither was the first to use it in calculations; it was introduced in 1888 by George F. FitzGerald.) The Lorenz gauge leads to the following inhomogeneous wave equations for the potentials: :\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t^2} - abla^2{\\\\varphi} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\varepsilon_0} :\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\mathbf A}{\\\\partial t^2} - abla^2{\\\\mathbf A} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathbf{J} It can be seen from these equations that, in the absence of current and charge, the solutions are potentials which propagate at the speed of light. The Lorenz gauge is incomplete in some sense: There remains a subspace of gauge transformations which can also preserve the constraint. These remaining degrees of freedom correspond to gauge functions which satisfy the wave equation :{ \\\\partial^2 \\\\psi \\\\over \\\\partial t^2 } = c^2 abla^2\\\\psi These remaining gauge degrees of freedom propagate at the speed of light. To obtain a fully fixed gauge, one must add boundary conditions along the light cone of the experimental region. Maxwell's equations in the Lorenz gauge simplify to :\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u = \\\\mu_0 j^ u where j^ u = \\\\left[\\\\,c\\\\,\\\\rho,\\\\,\\\\mathbf{j}\\\\,\\\\right] is the four-current. Two solutions of these equations for the same current configuration differ by a solution of the vacuum wave equation :\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u = 0. In this form it is clear that the components of the potential separately satisfy the Klein–Gordon equation, and hence that the Lorenz gauge condition allows transversely, longitudinally, and \\"time-like\\" polarized waves in the four-potential. The transverse polarizations correspond to classical radiation, i. e., transversely polarized waves in the field strength. To suppress the \\"unphysical\\" longitudinal and time-like polarization states, which are not observed in experiments at classical distance scales, one must also employ auxiliary constraints known as Ward identities. Classically, these identities are equivalent to the continuity equation :\\\\partial_\\\\mu j^\\\\mu = 0. Many of the differences between classical and quantum electrodynamics can be accounted for by the role that the longitudinal and time-like polarizations play in interactions between charged particles at microscopic distances. ==Rξ gauges== The Rξ gauges are a generalization of the Lorenz gauge applicable to theories expressed in terms of an action principle with Lagrangian density \\\\mathcal{L}. Instead of fixing the gauge by constraining the gauge field a priori, via an auxiliary equation, one adds a gauge breaking term to the \\"physical\\" (gauge invariant) Lagrangian :\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{L} = -\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\partial_{\\\\mu} A^{\\\\mu}\\\\right)^2}{2 \\\\xi} The choice of the parameter ξ determines the choice of gauge. The Landau gauge is classically equivalent to Lorenz gauge: it is obtained in the limit ξ → 0 but postpones taking that limit until after the theory has been quantized. It improves the rigor of certain existence and equivalence proofs. Most quantum field theory computations are simplest in the Feynman–'t Hooft gauge, in which ; a few are more tractable in other Rξ gauges, such as the Yennie gauge . An equivalent formulation of Rξ gauge uses an auxiliary field, a scalar field B with no independent dynamics: :\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{L} = B\\\\,\\\\partial_{\\\\mu} A^{\\\\mu} + \\\\frac{\\\\xi}{2} B^2 The auxiliary field, sometimes called a Nakanishi–Lautrup field, can be eliminated by \\"completing the square\\" to obtain the previous form. From a mathematical perspective the auxiliary field is a variety of Goldstone boson, and its use has advantages when identifying the asymptotic states of the theory, and especially when generalizing beyond QED. Historically, the use of Rξ gauges was a significant technical advance in extending quantum electrodynamics computations beyond one-loop order. In addition to retaining manifest Lorentz invariance, the Rξ prescription breaks the symmetry under local gauge transformations while preserving the ratio of functional measures of any two physically distinct gauge configurations. This permits a change of variables in which infinitesimal perturbations along \\"physical\\" directions in configuration space are entirely uncoupled from those along \\"unphysical\\" directions, allowing the latter to be absorbed into the physically meaningless normalization of the functional integral. When ξ is finite, each physical configuration (orbit of the group of gauge transformations) is represented not by a single solution of a constraint equation but by a Gaussian distribution centered on the extremum of the gauge breaking term. In terms of the Feynman rules of the gauge-fixed theory, this appears as a contribution to the photon propagator for internal lines from virtual photons of unphysical polarization. The photon propagator, which is the multiplicative factor corresponding to an internal photon in the Feynman diagram expansion of a QED calculation, contains a factor gμν corresponding to the Minkowski metric. An expansion of this factor as a sum over photon polarizations involves terms containing all four possible polarizations. Transversely polarized radiation can be expressed mathematically as a sum over either a linearly or circularly polarized basis. Similarly, one can combine the longitudinal and time-like gauge polarizations to obtain \\"forward\\" and \\"backward\\" polarizations; these are a form of light-cone coordinates in which the metric is off-diagonal. An expansion of the gμν factor in terms of circularly polarized (spin ±1) and light-cone coordinates is called a spin sum. Spin sums can be very helpful both in simplifying expressions and in obtaining a physical understanding of the experimental effects associated with different terms in a theoretical calculation. Richard Feynman used arguments along approximately these lines largely to justify calculation procedures that produced consistent, finite, high precision results for important observable parameters such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Although his arguments sometimes lacked mathematical rigor even by physicists' standards and glossed over details such as the derivation of Ward–Takahashi identities of the quantum theory, his calculations worked, and Freeman Dyson soon demonstrated that his method was substantially equivalent to those of Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, with whom Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics. Forward and backward polarized radiation can be omitted in the asymptotic states of a quantum field theory (see Ward–Takahashi identity). For this reason, and because their appearance in spin sums can be seen as a mere mathematical device in QED (much like the electromagnetic four-potential in classical electrodynamics), they are often spoken of as \\"unphysical\\". But unlike the constraint-based gauge fixing procedures above, the Rξ gauge generalizes well to non-abelian gauge groups such as the SU(3) of QCD. The couplings between physical and unphysical perturbation axes do not entirely disappear under the corresponding change of variables; to obtain correct results, one must account for the non-trivial Jacobian of the embedding of gauge freedom axes within the space of detailed configurations. This leads to the explicit appearance of forward and backward polarized gauge bosons in Feynman diagrams, along with Faddeev–Popov ghosts, which are even more \\"unphysical\\" in that they violate the spin–statistics theorem. The relationship between these entities, and the reasons why they do not appear as particles in the quantum mechanical sense, becomes more evident in the BRST formalism of quantization. ==Maximal Abelian gauge== In any non-Abelian gauge theory, any maximal Abelian gauge is an incomplete gauge which fixes the gauge freedom outside of the maximal Abelian subgroup. Examples are *For SU(2) gauge theory in D dimensions, the maximal Abelian subgroup is a U(1) subgroup. If this is chosen to be the one generated by the Pauli matrix σ3, then the maximal Abelian gauge is that which maximizes the function ::\\\\int d^Dx \\\\left[\\\\left(A_\\\\mu^1\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(A_\\\\mu^2\\\\right)^2\\\\right]\\\\,, :where ::{\\\\mathbf A}_\\\\mu = A_\\\\mu^a \\\\sigma_a\\\\,. *For SU(3) gauge theory in D dimensions, the maximal Abelian subgroup is a U(1)×U(1) subgroup.

The party's platform is based upon the principles of U.S. economist Henry George - who advocated a single tax on all land - and those of Danish moral philosopher Severin Christensen. The party was elected to parliament for the first time in 1926, and they were moderately successful in the post-war period and managed to join a governing coalition with the Social Democrats and the Social Liberal Party from the years 1957–60. In 1960 they dropped out of the parliament. However in the 1973 Danish parliamentary election (the so-called Landslide Election) the party won 5 seats in Folketinget, because of their opposition to Danish membership of the European Economic Community. They lost their seats in the next election in 1975, but regained representation in 1977 and were represented until 1981. They also had a seat in the European Parliament 1978–79 (by Ib Christensen). The 1970s were followed by a dropoff of party support, and the party ceased to run at a national level in 1990, but in 2005 the party ran together with Minoritetspartiet (the Minority Party): this wasn't with any success since the Minority Party only achieved 0.3% of the votes. They have decided to try to collect the 20 000 signatures necessary to participate in the next election to the Folketing. They have also adopted a new communication strategy with four main policies: Danish exit from the EU, a better environmental policy, a humanitarian refugee and immigration policy and a tax reform with a 6% land tax financing a lower income tax and a reduction of the VAT on basic commodities from 25% to 12.5%.

He was also the 11th Governor of Hong Kong. ==Early life and colonial services== Robinson was born in 1836 in Suffolk, England. He was the eldest son of the Rev. Isaac Banks Robinson and Jane Susan (née Syer). He entered the Colonial Office at age 18 as a clerk, and within several years served as private secretary to Herman Merivale, Frederic Rogers and Edward Cardwell. He became a Member of Slave Trade Commission in 1869 and was appointed Governor of Bahama Isles from 1874 to 1880. A year later, Robinson was appointed governor of the Windward Islands, a position he held until 1884. Afterwards, he became Governor of Barbados, and was transferred to become the Governor of Trinidad a year later. In 1889 the colony of Tobago was merged with Trinidad into the united colony of Trinidad and Tobago, with Robinson as its first governor, a position he held until 1891. ==Governor of Hong Kong== In 1891, Robinson was appointed Governor of Hong Kong, a position he served until 1898 and later became his last post in the Colonial Services. During his tenure, Sun Yet-Sen graduated from the colony's Medical School. Also, Robinson received the thanks of the Hong Kong government for the settlement of the Fanny Josephine affair (Venezuela). ==Personal life== Robinson married twice. He married his first wife, Julia Sophia Dampier, 17 July 1862 at St. Saviour's Church, Paddington. The couple had three sons. She died in 1881 and Robinson married Felicia Ida Helen Rattray three years later, 21 July 1884 in Nassau. She died ten years later and is buried in Hong Kong Cemetery. The couple had three daughters. Robinson himself died of heart disease on 1 December 1912 in London. ==Honours== * CMG, 1877 * KCMG, 1883 * GCMG, 1897 ==Places named after him== Robinson Road, a major thoroughfare in Nassau, Bahamas, is named after Sir William Robinson, during whose term it was laid out. Despite public perceptions to the contrary, there are no places in Hong Kong named after Sir William Robinson. Places in Hong Kong with the name Robinson were actually named for an earlier Governor, Hercules Robinson, later the 1st Baron Rosmead. Robinson, Mark Aitchison Young and Christopher Patten are the only former Governors of Hong Kong who have nothing in Hong Kong named in their honour. ==See also== * History of Hong Kong ==References== |- Category:British governors of the Bahamas Category:Governors of Barbados Category:Governors of Hong Kong Category:Governors of British Trinidad Category:Governors of Trinidad and Tobago Category:1836 births Category:1912 deaths Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:People from the Grand Duchy of Baden Category:19th-century Hong Kong people Category:19th-century British politicians ","title":"William Robinson (colonial administrator, born 1836)"},{"id":"2000763","text":"James H. \\"Bill\\" Finch (1913 in Atlanta – July 28, 2003) was an American Architect and founder of architectural firm FABRAP. ==Early life and education== Finch graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1936 with a BS Architecture. ==Career== Finch was also a retired US Marine Lt.

For example, a teacher may have a positive societal image (respect, prestige) which increases their status but may earn little money, which simultaneously decreases their status. Advocates of the concept propose that status inconsistency has consequences for social action that cannot be predicted from the so-called \\"vertical\\" dimensions of status alone. (In statistical terms, it is an interaction effect). Introduced by Gerhard Lenski in the 1950s, the concept has remained controversial with limited empirical verification. One unresolved question is whether people who are judged by sociologists to be status inconsistent actually feel they are somehow under-rewarded or over- rewarded. Blocker and Riedesel (1978) employed more than the usual statistical controls and found evidence of neither a correlation between \\"objective\\" and \\"subjective\\" status inconsistency, nor of effects of either on hypothesized behavior that was independent of the vertical dimensions of status. ==General description== All societies have some basis for social stratification, and industrial societies are characterized by multiple dimensions to which some vertical hierarchy may be imputed. The notion of status inconsistency is simple: it is defined as occupying different vertical positions in two or more hierarchies. The complexity and dynamism of modern societies results in both social mobility, and the presence of people and social roles in these inconsistent or mixed status positions. Sociologists investigate issues of status inconsistency in order to better understand status systems and stratification, and because some sociologists believe that positions of status inconsistency might have strong effects on peoples behavior. In this line of reasoning people may react to an inconsistent status position as problematic, and thus may change their behavior, their patterns of sociation, or otherwise act to resolve the inconsistent position. During the last fifty years social researchers have investigated and debated evidence about how, where, why, and to what extent status inconsistency affects social action. Most attention has been given to inconsistency between material status and prestige or respect, arising from education, occupation, or ethnicity. Geschwender (1967), among others, suggests that the balance of investments (e.g. education) versus rewards (e.g. income) is at the heart of any actual effects of apparent status inconsistency. ==Theory and its development== Max Weber articulated three major dimensions of stratification in his discussion of class, power, and status. This multifaceted framework provides the background concepts for discussing status inconsistency. Status Inconsistency theories predict that people whose status is inconsistent, or higher on one dimension than one another, will be more frustrated and dissatisfied than people with consistent statuses. Gerhard Lenski was a major proponent of this theory. He argues that if people are ranked higher in one dimension than another, then they are going to emphasize their higher rank. Since others may focus instead on the former's lower rank, the situation may generate conflict. Lenski originally predicted that people suffering from Status Inconsistency will favor political actions and parties directed against higher status groups. Lenski continues by stating that Status Inconsistency can be used to further explain the phenomenon of why status groups made up of wealthy minorities will tend to be liberal instead of the presumed conservative. In the 1950s and 1960s, American Jews provided a strong anecdotal example: Politically liberal, better educated and more affluent than average, they were still subjected to discrimination in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. == Outstanding issues == While well-known, the concept of status inconsistency is not without its challengers and unresolved questions. *Can status inconsistency be reliably measured independent of the constituent vertical dimensions of stratification? *Can the hypothesized social psychological mechanism (e.g. feeling of being under-rewarded) for the effects of status inconsistency be validated? *Can consistent empirical effects be found at all outside the narrow spectrum of American politics? == See also == * Status–income disequilibrium * Status set == Notes  References == : : : : : : : : Category:Role status ","title":"Status inconsistency"},{"id":"2000798","text":"Virgilius Maro Grammaticus (Virgil the Grammarian; , fl. c. 7th century) is the author of two early medieval grammatical texts known as the Epitomae and the Epistolae. ==Biographical== It is unknown exactly when or where he was active: in the eleventh and twelfth centuries he was known to Abbo of Fleury and others as Virgil of Toulouse, and subsequent scholars have tried to attribute him to Spain, the Basque Country and Gaul. Apparent traces of Hebrew have also prompted suggestions that he may have been Jewish.(de) Bernhard Bischoff: Die „zweite Latinität“ des Virgilius Maro Grammaticus und seine jüdische Herkunft. In: Mittellateinisches Jahrbuch 23 (1988), p. 11–16. Supposed knowledge of some Old Irish vocabulary and verse has led to the most recent attribution to Ireland, and there is good evidence that his writings were well known to early medieval Irish scholars.Zimmer in George Calder's, Auraicept na n-éces, The Scholars Primer, being the texts of the ogham tract from the Book of Ballymote and the Yellow Book of Lecan, and the text of the Trefhocul from the Book of Leinster, ..., John Grant, Edinburgh 1917 (1995 repr.) However, the Irish evidence is not watertight, and Virgil's origins remain undetermined. However, Virgil can be dated with some confidence to the seventh century: he knew some parts of the Etymologiae by Isidore of Seville finished around 636; and was quoted before 709/10 by Aldhelm of Malmesbury. Quotations from Virgil in certain Irish computistical texts may place him in the first half of the seventh century, specifically before 658. ==Writings== His writings survive in around twenty manuscripts or fragments, dating from the eighth to the eleventh century. The three principal manuscripts (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale Latinus 13026; Amiens, Bibliothèque municipale, 426; and Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale IV.A.34) on which modern editions have been based were all written in early ninth-century France. In most manuscripts of Virgil also contain other grammatical and schoolroom texts. As a rule, the Epitomae travelled separately from the Epistolae, which are much more poorly represented in the surviving manuscripts: just one manuscript contains the entire text (Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale IV.A.34), and comparison with other fragments suggests its testimony may not always be trustworthy. Virgilius wrote at least two surviving works, the Epitomae and Epistolae. The number of books in both groups – 12 and 8 (though the last surviving Epitoma may have been numbered 15, implying there were once three more books now lost) – compares to the number of books in Donatus Ars Maior and Ars Minor. He displays knowledge of authors such as Isidore of Seville, Virgil and Aelius Donatus, but never quotes them by name. Instead one finds in his works a plethora of obscure and unlikely-sounding authorities mentioned nowhere else and quotations attributed to well-known authors which cannot be identified in their writings. Thus there are Varro, Cato,There are several people and writings called Cato from before Virgilius' day, and which source he used is uncertain. The best-known in his time may have been the Distichs of Cato, often called simply Cato. three Vergiliuses, three Vulcans, Aeneas and Origenes, and also Sufphonias, Galbungus, Sagillus, Blastus, Gurgilius, Balapsidius – the list can be expanded. Some of these names are clear fabrications, often displaying considerable knowledge of classical and patristic literature. Although written in a similar style to late antique grammatical texts and incorporating some genuine grammatical material, there is much baffling and outlandish material contained in Virgilius' writings: he discusses twelve kinds of Latin, of which only one is in regular use, and attributes much of his lore to grammarians up to a thousand years old, who debate questions such as the vocative of ego and write texts such as De laudibus indefunctorum (In praise of the undead). Often these grammatical authorities form the centre of anecdotes: Aeneas is often referred to as Virgil's teacher; an elderly Spanish grammarian visits Virgil in the dead of night; and others wage war with thousands of men over grammatical definitions. The oddity of Virgilius' texts extends beyond ignorance or even parody, and it has been argued that his peculiar fabrications are a veiled plea for diversity and variety. However, a great deal remains uncertain about Virgilius, his origins and his real purpose in writing. ==Bibliography== ;Editions and translations *J.

Born in Penang, Malaysia, he was the first Asian lawyer to be appointed a judge at the Supreme Court of Singapore. He served in the position of Chief Justice for 27 years, making him the longest-serving chief justice in the Commonwealth. ==Early life== He was born in Penang to parents Wee Gim Puay and Lim Paik Yew. He received his early education at the Penang Free School, and read law at St John's College, Cambridge. He was called to Bar at the Middle Temple in November 1938, and was admitted as an Advocate and Solicitor of Straits Settlements in 1940 upon returning to Penang. ==Legal practice== Wee practised law in Malaysia and Singapore from 1940 to 1957, with the firm Wee Swee Teow and Co. ==Judicial career== Wee became the first Asian lawyer to be appointed to the position of a judge at the Supreme Court of Singapore on 15 August 1957, and subsequently appointed Chief Justice of Singapore on 5 January 1963. His appointment as Chief Justice, marked the end of the century-old tradition of appointing British Chief Justices – the last of whom was Sir Alan Rose – for Singapore. Wee remained in the position for 27 years, making him the longest-serving chief justice not only in Singapore, but also in the Commonwealth. ==Other roles== Wee also served as the first chairman of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights from 1973 and remained at its helm for 18 years. Wee assumed the post of the acting President of Singapore for two days when Devan Nair stepped down as President. Wee Chong Jin had also stepped in when Singapore's heads of state were either away or indisposed. He had stood in for Yusof Ishak when he was Yang di-Pertuan Negara and also for President Benjamin Sheares. He was the first president of the Singapore Academy of Law in 1988. In August 1991, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. In April 1992, Wee was made an Honorary Member and Fellow of the Singapore Academy of Law for life – the highest honour made to a person by the Academy. He served as a legal consultant of the Supreme Court of Singapore after his retirement on 27 September 1990, and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2004. ==Sports== Wee was also known for his love for sports, as he was an outstanding cricketer for Cambridge University in 1937 and a keen golfer serving as President of the Singapore Golf Association from 1962 to 2002. ==Death== Wee died on 5 June 2005 of complications from lung and brain cancer, and a funeral was held at the Catholic Church of St. Ignatius at King's Road in Bukit Timah before his body was cremated at the Mandai Crematorium. Wee is survived by his wife, Cecilia Henderson, three sons, Laurence, John and Patrick, and one daughter, Veronica, and his grandchildren, Laura, Nicole, David and Michael. ==HonourHonour of Malaysia=== * : Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (P.M.N.)

A close translation of the name would be the \\"Shepherds' Mass\\" (literally: 'that which belongs to the shepherds' in Polish), in reference to the Biblical shepherds, who were visited by an angel and told of the birth of Christ. During the Pasterka Mass, Polish people sing traditional kolędy, Christmas carols from the Roman calendae) in the spirit of joy. ==Celebrations== Although Pasterka mass is closely associated with the specific time in Christian liturgy, it is not the actual hour of the night that predicates its meaning. According to Polish ordinance of the Eucharist, the Pasterka is defined only by the type of prayer and biblical texts used during Christmas celebrations. It can be held more than once on December 24, in more than one location by the parish priest; at the church and at a nearby chapel. Often, there are two (or even three) Pasterkas celebrated next to each other – earlier ones for the families with children, then at 9 and 10 p.m. for the youth, and a final one at 12:00 midnight, for the adults. Wigilia supper before midnight carolling at Pasterka The participation in the Birth of Christ celebrations is obligatory for all practicing Catholics. They have the option of attending any one of the evening masses or even more than one. Priests may refer to all of them as Pasterka, even though formally they are called Wigilia masses by the episcopate as opposed to the grand mass at midnight. The exact hour of the birth of Christ is not written in the canonical gospels, which allows for choosing the ideal time for ritual prayer on that occasion. On Christmas Eve (December 24) and on Christmas Day, the masses can be celebrated from three different liturgical texts, each suited to a specific sacrament of the Eucharist. In the early hours, the worshippers can attend the Advent waiting mass, which does not excuse them from participating in the Nativity mass for the Birth of Christ later on. There are no masses in the late afternoon on December 24, which is the time for Wigilia, the traditional supper at family homes. The first evening mass of the Christmas Eve (after the Wigilia) is celebrated around 4 p.m. or later before 8 p.m. followed by the 10 p.m. mass and the one-hour-long grand Midnight Mass, which begins at 12. Music for the Midnight Mass begins as soon as the doors open at 11:00 p.m. The Blessing of the Crib can take place before, or after the homilies, when the priests open the Szopka nativity scenes set up by the main altar. Traditionally, the service concludes with an Apostolic Blessing. The next day masses are interchangeable according to scripture, allowing for flexibility in choosing the religious services by individual parishioners. The Christmas Day begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses. Pasterka is a Catholic mass specific to the Birth of Christ celebrations in Poland. Participation in Pasterka is synonymous with Christmas. Many practicing Catholics visit the Church twice on that occasion and are encouraged by the priest to do so. ==See also== * Polish Christmas carol Bóg się rodzi (God Is Born) * Christmas worldwide ==References== Category:Polish traditions Category:Christmas in Poland ","title":"Pasterka"},{"id":"2000818","text":"\\"Promises, Promises\\" is the first single to be taken from The Cooper Temple Clause's second album, Kick Up the Fire, and Let the Flames Break Loose.

Friedman that analyzes globalization, primarily in the early 21st century. The title is a metaphor for viewing the world as a level playing field in terms of commerce, wherein all competitors, except for labor, have an equal opportunity. As the first edition cover illustration indicates, the title also alludes to the perceptual shift required for countries, companies, and individuals to remain competitive in a global market in which historical and geographic divisions are becoming increasingly irrelevant. Friedman is a strong advocate of those changes, calling himself a \\"free-trader\\" and a \\"compassionate flatist\\", and he criticizes societies that resist the changes. He emphasizes the inevitability of a rapid pace of change and the extent to which the emerging abilities of individuals and developing countries are creating many pressures on businesses and individuals in the United States; he has special advice for Americans and for the developing world (but says almost nothing about Europe). Friedman's is a popular work based on much personal research, travel, conversation, and reflection. In his characteristic style, through personal anecdotes and opinions, he combines in The World Is Flat a conceptual analysis accessible to a broad public. The book was first released in 2005, was later released as an \\"updated and expanded\\" edition in 2006, and was yet again released with additional updates in 2007 as \\"further updated and expanded: Release 3.0\\". The title was derived from a statement by Nandan Nilekani, former CEO of Infosys. The World Is Flat won the inaugural Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award in 2005. ==Summary== In his book The World Is Flat, Friedman recounts a journey to Bangalore, India, when he realized globalization has changed core economic concepts. In his opinion, that flattening is a product of the convergence of the personal computer with fiber optic microcable with the rise of work flow software. Friedman termed the period Globalization 3.0, thereby differentiating it from the previous, Globalization 1.0, during which countries and governments were the main protagonists, and Globalization 2.0, during which multinational companies led the way in driving global integration. Friedman recounts many examples of companies based in India and China that, by providing labor ranging from that of typists and call center operators to accountants and computer programmers, have become integral parts of complex global supply chains; such companies are Dell, AOL, and Microsoft. Friedman's capitalist peace theory called Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention is discussed in the book's penultimate chapter. Friedman repeatedly uses lists as organizational devices to communicate key concepts, usually numbered and often with provocative labels. Two example lists are the ten forces that flattened the world, and three points of convergence. === Ten flatteners === Friedman defines ten \\"flatteners\\" that he sees as levelling the global playing field: # Collapse of the Berlin Wall - 11/9/89: Friedman called the flattener \\"When the walls came down, and the windows came up.\\" The event not only symbolized the end of the Cold War but also allowed people from the other side of the wall to join the economic mainstream. \\"11/9/89\\" is a discussion about the Berlin Wall's coming down, the \\"fall\\" of communism, and the impact that Windows-powered PCs (personal computers) had on the ability of individuals to create their own content and connect to one another. At that point, the basic platform for the revolution to follow was created: the IBM PC, Windows, a graphical interface for word processing, dial-up modems, a standardized tool for communication, and a global phone network. # Netscape - 8/9/95: Netscape went public at the price of $28. Netscape and the Web broadened the audience for the Internet from its roots as a communications medium used primarily by \\"early adopters and geeks\\" to something that made the Internet accessible to everyone from five-year-olds to ninety-five-year-olds. The digitization that took place meant that everyday occurrences such as words, files, films, music, and pictures could be accessed and manipulated on a computer screen by all people across the world. # Workflow software: This is Friedman's catch-all for the standards and technologies that allowed work to flow. It is the ability of machines to talk to other machines with no humans involved. Friedman believes the first three forces have become a \\"crude foundation of a whole new global platform for collaboration\\". This is complemented by the emergence of software protocols (SMTP - simple mail transfer protocol; HTML - the language that enabled anyone to design and publish documents that could be transmitted to and read on any computer anywhere). The emergence of such software is the \\"Genesis moment of the flat world\\" and means \\"that people can work with other people on more stuff than ever before\\". This created a global platform for multiple forms of collaboration, on which the next six flatteners depend. # Uploading: Uploading involves communities that upload and collaborate on online projects. Examples are open source software, blogs, and Wikipedia. Friedman considers the phenomenon \\"the most disruptive force of all\\". # Outsourcing: Friedman argues that outsourcing has enabled companies to split service and manufacturing activities into components that can be subcontracted and performed in the most efficient, most cost-effective way. This process became easier with the mass distribution of fiber-optic cable during the introduction of the World Wide Web. # Offshoring: This is the internal relocation of a company's manufacturing or other processes to a foreign land to take advantage of less costly operations there. China's entrance into the World Trade Organization allowed for greater competition on the playing field. Now such countries as Malaysia, Mexico, and Brazil must compete against China and one another to have businesses offshore to them. # Supply-chaining: Friedman compares the modern retail supply chain to a river by pointing to Wal-Mart as the best example of a company that uses technology to streamline item sales, distribution, and shipping. # Insourcing: Friedman uses UPS as a prime example for insourcing, whereby the company's employees perform services - beyond shipping - for another company. For example, UPS repairs Toshiba computers on behalf of Toshiba. The work is done at the UPS hub by UPS employees. # Informing: Google and other search engines and Wikipedia are the prime examples. \\"Never before in the history of the planet have so many people - on their own - had the ability to find so much information about so many things and about so many other people\\", writes Friedman. The growth of search engines is tremendous; for example, Friedman states, Google is \\"now processing roughly one billion searches per day, up from 150 million just three years ago\\". # \\"The Steroids\\": The steroids are wireless, Voice over IP (VoIP), and file sharing and are used on personal digital devices like mobile phones, iPods, and personal digital assistants; on instant messaging; and on VoIP phones. Digital, mobile, personal, and virtual as well as all analog content and processes (from entertainment to photography, to word processing) can be digitized and therefore shaped, manipulated, and transmitted; and these processes can be done at high speed with total ease; mobile can be done anywhere and anytime by anyone, and can be done to anyone. === Proposed remedies === Friedman believes that to fight the quiet crisis of a flattening world, the US workforce should keep updating its work skills. Making the workforce more adaptable, Friedman argues, will keep it more employable. He also suggests that the government make it easier for people to switch jobs by making retirement benefits and health insurance less dependent on one's employer and by providing insurance that would partly cover a possible drop in income when changing jobs. Friedman also believes there should be more inspiration for youth to become scientists, engineers, and mathematicians because of a decrease in the percentage of those professionals who are American. ===Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention=== The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention, also known as simply the Dell Theory, is a capitalist peace theory and an updated version of Friedman's previous \\"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\\". According to Friedman: That is, as long as corporations have major supply chain operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts. This is because of the economic interdependence between nations that arises when a large corporation (such as Dell) has supply chain operations in multiple global locations and when developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) are reluctant to give up their newfound wealth. In his previous book The Lexus and the Olive Tree, Friedman argued that no two nations with a McDonald's franchise had ever gone to war with one another; this was known as the Golden Arches theory. Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the \\"Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention\\" by saying that people or nations do not just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by a McDonald's franchise in their downtown but also want to have that lump of the labor sector that is created by globalization. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multinational companies that venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain. Thomas Friedman also warns that the Dell theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations that are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It means, rather, that the governments of those nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. Such costs include long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain. This theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between India and Pakistan in their 2001–2002 nuclear standoff, wherein India was at risk of losing its global partners. The relationship between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan was also cited as an example of that theory: both countries have strong supply relations with each other, and a war between the two seems very unlikely today. == Critical reception == The World Is Flat received generally positive popular and critical reception as well as some negative criticism, peppered with doubt. The Washington Post called the book an \\"engrossing tour\\" and an \\"enthralling read\\". The review closed with, \\"We've no real idea how the 21st century's history will unfold, but this terrifically stimulating book will certainly inspire readers to start thinking it all through\\". An opposing viewpoint was found in a 2007 Foreign Policy magazine article in which Professor Pankaj Ghemawat argued that 90% of the world's phone calls, Web traffic, and investments are local, suggesting that Friedman has grossly exaggerated the significance of the trends he describes: \\"Despite talk of a new, wired world where information, ideas, money, and people can move around the planet faster than ever before, just a fraction of what we consider globalization actually exists.\\"Pankaj Ghemawat (March/April 2007). \\"Why the World Isn't Flat\\" Foreignpolicy.com.

Sainath, Rural Affairs Editor for The Hindu, says \\"it's not the 'world' that is flat, but Thomas Friedman's 'brain' is flat\\". Some critics have pointed out that the book is written from an American perspective. Friedman's work history has been mostly with The New York Times, and that may have influenced the way the book was written - some would have preferred a book written in a more \\"inclusive voice\\".Peter Begley (2006). \\"The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty- first Century\\".

Atlantic Monthly. Accessed 2009-05-09. John Gray, formerly a School Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science, wrote another critical review of Friedman's book called \\"The World Is Round\\". In it, Gray confirms Friedman's assertion that globalization is making the world more interconnected and, in some parts, richer but disputes the notion that globalization makes the world more peaceful or freer. Gray also declares, \\"least of all does it make it flat\\". Geographers on the whole have been particularly critical of Friedman's writings, views influenced by the large body of work within their field demonstrating the uneven nature of globalization, the strong influence place still has on people's lives, and the dependent relationships that have been established between the have and have- not regions in the current world-system. Geographer Harm de Blij detailed those arguments for the general public in Why Geography Matters: Three Challenges Facing America (2005) and The Power of Place: Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape (2008). == Editions == * [The original jacket illustration, reproducing the painting I Told You So by Ed Miracle, depicting a sailing ship falling off the edge of the world, was changed during the print run due to copyright issues.

Here she finds a new life and a new family, and learns that she has the magical ability known as \\"Wild Magic\\", which enables her to speak to animals, heal them, and take their shape as well as bend them to her will. She makes friends with a lineup of characters and creatures, including the black- robe mage Numair Salmalin, a young dragon named Skysong (nicknamed Kitten), the legendary Lioness, Alanna of Trebond, King Jonathan, and Queen Thayet of Tortall. ==CharactersMain=== *Veralidaine \\"Daine\\" Sarrasri: The main character of the quartet, she is a young woman possessing \\"wild magic,\\" and has the power to speak to, heal, and shapeshift into animals. Born in the village of Snowsdale in Galla, her father is Weiryn, a minor god of the hunt who fell in love with Daine's mother, Sarra. Despite her original fear of her wild magic overpowering her, she learns to control her power. She is shown to hate Stormwings, magical creatures who prey on fear and warfare, in the first books, but later changes her mind when she realizes that Stormwings are simply what they are. She even develops a tentative friendship with a Stormwing named Rikash. Daine (along with other characters of the series) also appears briefly in the Protector of the Small and Daughter of the Lioness series. *Numair Salmalin: A brown skinned, very tall, very powerful mage with the ability to shape shift. He is one of the seven \\"black-robe\\" mages in the world, and though is usually mild-mannered and awkward, can be extremely emotional at times. This is shown when he turns a mage gone bad (a former friend at school named Tristan Staghorn) into a tree after he, (Tristan) tries to hurt Daine. In \\"Emperor Mage,\\" he is hinted to have been Emperor Ozorne's friend once, but they are now enemies. He is Daine's teacher and eventual love interest; they are married shortly before the events of Trickster's Choice and have two children, Rikash and Sarralyn. *Onua Chamtong: A trader and horse mistress for the Queen's Riders. She hires Daine as her assistant in Wild Magic. It is revealed that she was physically abused by her husband and left for dead before joining the Riders. She has a very affectionate dog, Tahoi (meaning \\"ox\\") and possesses the Gift and some Wild Magic. A friend of Numair and Alanna, Onua is gifted with the ability to hide things with her magic. She uses the bow well. *Ozorne: Emperor of Carthak, until the end of Emperor Mage, when he is tricked into turning into a Stormwing. He is ruthless and loves power, though he is shown as having a soft side for birds and other animals, especially immortals. He and Numair do not get along and he is said to have banished his old friend before. An extremely powerful mage, Ozorne made the mistake of believing himself invincible. *Kaddar: The prince of Carthak, becoming emperor at the end of Emperor Mage. Friend of Daine because he was her guide during her visit to Carthak. Though at first he acts a bit stiff, he is really kind at heart and finally defies his uncle while simultaneously saving his life from the enraged Daine, who had shape-shifted into a hyena. ===Immortals=== *Skysong (nicknamed Kitten): A baby dragon whose mother died in the battle at Pirate's Swoop in Wild Magic. Skysong was initially dead in the womb before Daine inadvertently healed her mother, and afterwards Daine becomes her guardian for the rest of the series. It is shown that despite her love for Daine, Skysong needed \\"discipline\\" from her own kind and that she would later return to the dragon's home in the Divine Realms. She is shown to be highly advanced and can whistle locks open, sense invisibility spells, and detect magic used for spying. *Tkaa: A basilisk who found Daine in Dunlath and became a friend. He also appears as an envoy to the Copper Isles in Daughter of the Lioness and as the teacher of the immortals class in Protector of the Small. His first encounter with Numair showed his power. Though he meant him no harm, he threw magic at Numair and he turned him into a rock as self- defense. He broke out of the rock in a few minutes, paused, and asked if Tkaa would do it again so he could see if he could break out of the rock a second time. He refused, but the two became good friends. Tkaa is said to have skin like solid gray drops which darken and lighten in patterns across his skin. *Rikash Moonsword: A Stormwing introduced during Wolf-Speaker, who eventually becomes Daine's friend and ally. Daine is shown to have named her son Rikash in Trickster's Queen. He is always insulting and teasing her, but shows rare kindnesses, like awkwardly comforting her when she believed Numair was dead. In Wolf-Speaker, he is shown to have a soft spot for Maura of Dunlath, his ward. *Barzha Razorwing: A Stormwing queen, who, with her consort Hebekah, is imprisoned by Ozorne in Carthak. They are released at the end of Emperor Mage and become Daine's allies. Daine accidentally informs Rikash of their whereabouts, startling the Stormwing because he and his kind were told that they had been killed in a fair fight. ===Animals=== *Cloud: A pony that Daine has had since before the series started. She is quite stubborn, but is very loyal to Daine. It was partly through her ability to speak with Cloud that Daine learned of her wild magic. She refers to Numair as \\"Stork Man\\". Cloud's mind was changed after repeatedly biting Daine and getting some of Daine's wild magic inadvertently transferred into her, and she can reason and think like a human. It is revealed that she can transfer her energy to Daine, as shown at the end of Wild Magic, so the girl could kill the Stormwing Queen, Zhaneh Bitterclaws. *Tahoi: A large dog (his name means \\"ox\\") that works with Onua and Daine on the trails with the horses, he saved Onua's life when her husband had beaten her and left her for dead. He is a \\"one woman dog,\\" but takes to Daine anyway. He is an expert at guarding the ponies and avoiding being kicked by them. *Zekoi: A pygmy marmoset that Daine befriends after saving it from crocodiles in the River Zekoi during the events in Emperor Mage. He is said to have a family back in the wild and has a fascination with keys. After he was captured, he learned more about keys, and then vowed to always have keys from then on. He later frees Daine from Ozorne's prison with a set of his favorite objects. ===Others=== *Sarra Beneksri: Daine's mother, who is killed in the events preceding Wild Magic. It is discovered as the series progresses that she has become The Green Lady, a minor goddess of women and childbirth, and was married to Weiryn. She was a midwife before she was killed, and possessed the Gift. *Weiryn: Daine's father, and a minor god of the hunt. He is mostly human in appearance, though with a pair of antlers. Resigned to the fact that Daine, his child, won't eat game, (she eats game through the first and second book) Weiryn nevertheless provides her with a beautiful bow and a magical staff for Numair to aid them on their journey in The Realms of the Gods. ==See also== 2 The Immortals Category:Fantasy novel series Category:Talking animals in fiction ","title":"The Immortals (series)"},{"id":"2000840","text":"This is a list of the works that have won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award, given annually to works of science fiction or fantasy literature.

Prior to seminary, he was a prisoner of conscience in Burma. He is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Australia. == Early life == Mawdsley was born in 1973. His parents are David and Diana, and he has three siblings. He gave up his study at Bristol University, and while backpacking met Burmese refugees who engaged his interest in the plight of ethnic minorities in Burma. Although subsequently a declaration of nullity was issued, he married his wife, Elizabeth, in January 2005. They honeymooned in Rome, where their union was blessed by Pope John Paul II. == Burmese activism and imprisonment == Mawdsley took up teaching English at a Burmese refugee camp, and became further involved when government forces burnt down the school. He was arrested three times for his involvement, and deported three times. The second arrest was in May 1998, for handing out stickers and playing songs for the pro democracy movement. On arrest, he was tortured for fifteen hours, and sentenced to five years imprisonment, which was suspended after 98 days. He was rearrested a third time in September 1999, for illegal entry and sedition, and was sentenced to seventeen years in jail. His imprisonment was held to be arbitrary by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2000. This time, he spent 415 days in solitary confinement, before his release in October 2000, after pressure was exerted by the United Kingdom Foreign Office on the authorities in Myanmar. == External activism and politics == Mawdsley's memoir of his experiences in Burma, The Heart Must Break: The Fight for Democracy and Truth in Burma, was published in 2001; in the United States, the book was titled The Iron Road: A Stand for Truth and Democracy in Burma. In February 2003, Mawdsley co authored New Ground, a pamphlet advocating foreign policy based around freedom, dignity and the rule of law. This document has helped give rise to the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, founded in October 2005.Dr Fox reaches out to right in confident performance At the 2004 European Parliament Election, Mawdsley was a candidate on the Conservative Party list for the North West England. However, he was placed ninth on the list, so was not one of the three Conservatives who won a seat. In February 2005, he was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate for the constituency of Hyndburn, due to the previous candidate deciding not to stand, overseeing unsuccessful campaigns in 1997 and 2001. In the 2005 General Election, which took place in May 2005, he lost to sitting MP Greg Pope by 5,587 votes. Ken Hargreaves supported his bid into becoming the next MP for Hyndburn. His wife suffered an ectopic pregnancy on the eve of the General Election. == Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter == Mawdsley is now a Catholic priest of the FSSP, having studied to become a priest at the FSSP seminary at Wigratzbad in Germany. He was ordained to the priesthood on 2 July 2016, and was assistant priest at St Mary's Church, Warrington in Cheshire, England through October 2017. From November 2017 through August 2018, Mawdsley was assigned to the FSSP apostolate in Reading, Berkshire, where he served the Latin Mass centres of Bedford and Chesham Bois. Since September 2018, Mawdsley has been assigned to the FSSP apostolate in Vienna, Austria. ==See also== * Burma National Army ==References External links == * Conservative Party Human Rights Commission Category:British human rights activists Category:British non- fiction writers Category:British foreign policy writers Category:British Roman Catholics Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:British democracy activists Category:Australian democracy activists Category:British male writers Category:Conservative Party (UK) politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British Traditionalist Catholics Category:Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter ","title":"James Mawdsley"},{"id":"2000857","text":"The Coca-Cola headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, designed by FABRAP and completed in 1979.

FABRAP embraced the International style popular at the time. FABRAP partnered with Heery and Heery, another major Atlanta architecture firm, in 1965 to develop the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. Following the quick completion of this stadium, the partnership gained a large business in developing sports facilities, including the $45 million Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1970. FABRAP was hired and partnered with other firms to develop the headquarters for First National Bank in 1966, Coca-Cola in 1979, and Southern Bell in 1982.

Since this season is not actual new episodes in of themselves, but rather old episodes with new special effects thrown in them, this season is not usually counted by fans or the current owner of the show (Hasbro) towards the total season count (making the current season count one less than expected despite being on for years). However, it is mentioned here anyway because the current owner of the show, from a production standpoint, does consider its existence as an official season in addition to the other seasons despite not including it in the total season count.Also see List of Power Rangers episodes. | rowspan=\\"7\\"|Power RangersWhile the show takes place in the same fictional universe for its entire run, it is often renamed on a yearly basis as the central location, theme, and characters change almost completely on a season-by-season basis. | FOXFirst broadcast episodes on August 28, 1993.

He won a hat-trick of consecutive titles at The Open Championship in 1880, 1881 and 1882. In addition to the three Open Championship wins, he posted top-10 finishes seven times. ==Early life== Ferguson was born in Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland, circa 1846. ==Golf career== In addition to his three Open Championship titles, Ferguson was especially noted for his putting, not only on the green but off. He specialized in \\"run up\\" shots with his putter—the so- called \\"Musselburgh iron\\"—from well off the green. He is one of only four men who have won The Open three years in a row. The prize for his first win was £7. Ferguson's home town of Musselburgh was one of the three venues in the Open Championship rotation. He started caddying there at the age of eight, and played his first competition at Leith when he was 18. He was a tall man, and was known as a long driver. He sometimes partnered with fellow Musselburgh top player Willie Park Sr., a four-time Open champion, in stakes matches, facing opponents such as the father-and-son team of Old Tom Morris and Young Tom Morris, of St. Andrews, between the mid-1860s and mid-1870s. Both of the Morrises were four-time Open champions. He also faced Young Tom Morris in singles play during this era.Tommy's Honor, by Kevin Cook, 2007, Gotham Books, New York His playing career was cut short by a bout of typhoid, and he became the custodian of the Links at Musselburgh. ==Death and legacy== Ferguson died in Musselburgh on 19 May 1915. ==Major championshipsWins (3)=== {|class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" !Year!!Championship!!18/24 holes!!Winning score!!Margin!!Runner-up |-style=\\"background:#ABCDEF;\\" | align=center|1880 ||The Open Championship ||1 shot lead || 40-41-42-39=162 ||5 strokes || Peter Paxton |-style=\\"background:#ABCDEF;\\" | align=center|1881 ||The Open Championship (2) ||3 shot lead || 53-60-57=170 ||3 strokes || Jamie Anderson |-style=\\"background:#ABCDEF;\\" | align=center|1882 ||The Open Championship (3) ||3 shot lead || 83-88=171 ||3 strokes || Willie Fernie |} ===Results timeline=== {| cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\\" |- style=\\"background:#eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"|Tournament !1868 !1869 !1870 !1871 !1872 !1873 !1874 !1875 !1876 !1877 !1878 !1879 |- |The Open Championship |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"|5 |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\"|NT |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"|T8 |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"|4 |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"|T3 |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"|6 |} {| cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\\" |- style=\\"background:#eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"|Tournament !1880 !1881 !1882 !1883 !1884 !1885 !1886 !1887 !1888 !1889 |- |The Open Championship |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:lime;\\"|1 |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:lime;\\"|1 |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:lime;\\"|1 |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"|2 |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"|T4 |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\"|DNP |align=\\"center\\"|T15 |} *Note: Ferguson played only in The Open Championship.

The entire Estate was 30 acres. The Great House at Sabina Park Pen was named Rosemount. ===Sabina Park Pen=== Higman and Hudson tell us that the name is a \\"transfer name\\" ie a name copied from somewhere else, in this case \\"the region around Rome\\" of Magliano Sabina.

This arrangement continued until 27 November 1890 when it was purchased for £750. Sabina Park became a Test cricket ground in 1930 when it hosted the visiting MCC team for the fourth and final Test in the West Indies' first home series. The picturesque ground is perhaps one of the most significant in Test cricket history recording the first triple century in the game with England's Andy Sandham's 325 versus the West Indies in the 1930 game. The 365 not out by Sir Garfield Sobers which stood as a Test record for over 36 years is also regaled, as is Lawrence Rowe's world record on debut 214 and 100 not out against the visiting New Zealand in 1972.Heatley, pp. 174. Sabina Park was the venue for the abandoned test in 1998 involving the touring England team. The test was abandoned after less than an hour's play due to the pitch being deemed unfit for play. Prior to Independence Park opening in 1962, it would also host the Jamaica national football team. ==Facilities== The members pavilion lies square of the wicket on the west side. The Blue Mountains form a backdrop to the north, facing the George Headley Stand, with Kingston Harbour to the south. This view is currently blocked by the Northern Stand, built as part of the ground's redevelopment for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The George Headley stand which dominates the south end is currently the only stand in the ground named after anyone, and has a capacity of just over 6,000. The Eastern Stands has given way to a \\"Party Stand\\" replacing the popular \\"Mound\\" stand. The general capacity of Jamaicans for excess is aptly demonstrated in the construction of the huge five-level concrete stand which hosts the outside broadcast facilities, players facilities as well as a fleet of upscale private boxes. In terms of size, Sabina Park is still relatively small. It can fit a 400-metre running track comfortably on its perimeter, but little else, and with its refurbishing, the capacity has increased to 20,000. With the commissioning of floodlights in August 2014, Sabina Park became the last of the international grounds in the Caribbean to have this facility. The ground is now capable of hosting day/night matches and this is especially useful for the Caribbean Premier League where the Jamaica Tallawahs play their home games. ==See also== *List of Test cricket grounds *List of international cricket centuries at Sabina Park *List of international five-wicket hauls at Sabina Park ==References== * ==External links== * Satellite image at Google Maps * Sabina Park at CricketArchive Category:Cricket grounds in Jamaica Category:Buildings and structures in Kingston, Jamaica Category:Football venues in Jamaica Category:Rugby league stadiums in Jamaica Category:Sport in Kingston, Jamaica Category:Test cricket grounds in the West Indies Category:1895 establishments in Jamaica Category:Sports venues completed in 1895 Category:2007 Cricket World Cup stadiums ","title":"Sabina Park"},{"id":"2000892","text":"Oblique view from Apollo 15 Sinus Honoris (Latin sinus honōris \\"Bay of Honour\\") is located along the western edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis located on the surface of the near side of the moon.

Chart Attack, July 17, 2001 with over two million album sales and a few top 20 hits both home and abroad. Their debut album, Onka's Big Moka, sold over one million units and peaked in the Top 5 of the UK Albums Chart, where it remained for six months. It earned them four nominations at the 2001 Brit Awards. They are recognised most of all for their cover of King Harvest's US hit \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" written by Sherman Kelly, which became a global hit for the band. Their second album, Magic Hotel, reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart. The band reunited in 2009; they continue to tour at various gigs and record music. ==CareerFormation and early start (1997–1998)=== Guitarist, Dan Hipgrave Named after a joint-rolling technique, Toploader's live career began playing with Coldplay and Muse in small venues across the UK. They later went on to support the likes of Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher, Tom Jones, Robbie Williams and Simple Minds. On 20 July 2000 they backed Bon Jovi at the original Wembley Stadium, becoming the last British band to play there before it was demolished and redeveloped. ===Commercial success (1999–2001)=== By 1998, Toploader were picked up by S2 Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music, and signed a six-album deal. On 7 May 1999, the band made their first live TV performance on TFI Friday, hosted by Chris Evans. Later that same year their debut album, Onka's Big Moka, was released on 11 November and became a huge hit. It was produced by Dave Eringa, a long time collaborator of the Manic Street Preachers. It debuted at number five in the UK Albums Chart, until it settled at number four. \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" was the top single off the album, eventually reaching number seven in the UK Singles Chart, while \\"Achilles Heel\\" managed to get to number eight. They gained four nominations at the Brit Awards, despite never winning any of them. On 24 June 2000, Toploader attended the Glastonbury Festival, as part of the Saturday line-up. ===Break-up (2002–2003)=== In 2002 they released a second album, Magic Hotel. The album was poorly received by critics and failed to match the success of the first. They struggled with a backlash from the UK music press and their single, \\"Time of My Life\\", could only make it into the Top 20. Because of the negative reception and the album not meeting the same success as the first, they were dropped by S2. Not long after that, the band broke up in 2003. Julian Deane retired as a musician and in 2007 he founded Raygun Music, a Brighton based management company, that serves both as a record label and publisher. ===Reforming and later work (2009–present)=== Toploader performing at The Doghouse in Dundee in October 2011. Six years later, Toploader reformed and signed a one-album deal with Underdogs Music for their third album, which was released in June 2011. The album's title was Only Human, and the first single from it, \\"Never Stop Wondering\\", was released on 14 March 2011. Another single, \\"A Balance to All Things\\" (featuring a remix from Ash Howes), followed on 20 June 2011. The present band line-up contains three of the five original members: Joseph Washbourn, Dan Hipgrave and Rob Green. On 28 April 2012, they performed at the University of Gloucestershire Student Union Summerball. They also performed at Aberystwyth University's May Ball on 11 May 2012. In May 2012, they played at Lakefest festival. They also played at the Tiree Music Festival in July 2012. During 2012 the band agreed to act as patrons for a UK- based children's charity called 'Time Is Precious'. In November 2012 they performed a gig in Frome, Somerset with all proceeds going to the charity, which helps ill children and their families. In 2013, Toploader released a new single \\"Turn It Around\\", co-written with Eg White and produced by Andrew Green. The song is included on a four-song EP. In the summer of 2013 they headlined the LeeStock Music Festival in Suffolk and the AmpRocks Festival in Bedfordshire. On 12 May 2017, Toploader's fourth album, Seeing Stars was released. Under a different music label, Big Lake Music, a sublabel of India Media Group. \\"Roll with the Punches\\" was chosen as the lead single. The album was crowdfunded using an online direct-to-fan music platform called PledgeMusic. One year before the album's release, Matt Knight left the band. Jordan Smith from The Xcerts has occasionally performed live with Toploader, but isn't a full time member. ==Members== Current members *Joseph Washbourn – lead vocals, keyboard, organ, piano, acoustic guitar (1997–2003, 2009–present) *Dan Hipgrave – guitars, backing vocals (1997–2003, 2009–present) *Patrick Greenberg – bass, backing vocals (2016–present) *Sean Burton – guitars, backing vocals (2009–present) *Rob Green – drums, percussion (1997–2003, 2009–present) Former members *Matt Knight – bass, backing vocals (1997–2003, 2009–2016) *Julian Deane – guitars, backing vocals (1997–2003) ==DiscographyStudio albums=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" |- ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:3px;;\\"| Year ! style=\\"width:250px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"| Album details ! colspan=\\"3\\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\"| Certifications (sales thresholds) |- !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"|UK !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"|AUS Peaks in Australia: * \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\": * Onka's Big Moka: !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"|NLD |- |1999 |align=\\"left\\"| Onka's Big Moka *Released: 11 November 1999 *Label: S2 *Formats: CD, cassette, vinyl, digital download | 4 || 99 || 86 | *BPI: 3× Platinum |- |2002 |align=\\"left\\"| Magic Hotel *Released: 19 August 2002 *Label: S2 *Formats: CD, cassette, vinyl, digital download | 3 || — || — | * BPI: Silver |- |2011 |align=\\"left\\"| Only Human *Released: 6 June 2011 *Label: Underdogs Music *Formats: CD, digital download | — || — || — | |- |2017 |align=\\"left\\"| Seeing Stars *Released: 12 May 2017 *Label: Big Lake Music *Formats: CD, digital download | — || — || — | |} ===Compilation albums=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" |- ! style=\\"width:1px;;\\"| Year ! style=\\"width:310px;\\"| Album details |- |2009 |align=\\"left\\"| Dancing in the Moonlight – The Best of Toploader *Released: 9 March 2009 *Label: Sony CMG *Formats: CD, digital download |} ===Singles=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" |- !rowspan=\\"2\\"| Year ! style=\\"width:250px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"| Single !colspan=\\"4\\"| Peak chart positions !rowspan=\\"2\\"| Album |- !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"|UK !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"|IRE !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"|AUS !style=\\"width:3em;font-size:75%\\"|NLD |- |rowspan=\\"2\\"|1999 |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Achilles Heel\\" | 64 || — || — || — | rowspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"| Onka's Big Moka |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Let the People Know\\" | 52 || — || — || — |- |rowspan=\\"4\\"|2000 |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" | 19 || — || 12 || 52 |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Achilles Heel\\" (re-release) | 8 || — || — || 80 |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Just Hold On\\" | 20 || — || — || — |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" (re-release) | 7 || 9 || — || — |- |2001 |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Only for a While\\" | 19 || — || — || — |- |rowspan=\\"2\\"|2002 |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Time of My Life\\" | 18 || — || — || 95 | rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"| Magic Hotel |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" | 76 || — || — || — |- |rowspan=\\"3\\"|2011 |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Never Stop Wondering\\" | — || — || — || — | rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"| Only Human |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"A Balance to All Things\\" | — || — || — || — |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"She Said\\" | — || — || — || — |- | rowspan=\\"2\\"| 2013 |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Turn It Around\\" | — || — || — || — | rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"| Non-album single |- |align=\\"left\\"| \\"This Is the Night\\" | — || — || — || — |- | 2017 |align=\\"left\\"| \\"Roll with the Punches\\" | — || — || — || — | rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"| Seeing Stars |} ==Awards and nominations== ;Brit Awards |- | rowspan=\\"5\\" | 2001 || rowspan=\\"2\\" | \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" || British Single of the Year || |- | British Video of the Year || |- | rowspan=\\"3\\" | Toploader || British Group || |- | British Breakthrough Act || ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Musical groups from London Category:English indie rock groups Category:Post-Britpop groups Category:Musical groups established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in England ","title":"Toploader"},{"id":"2000918","text":"The AWA Midwest Heavyweight Championship was a title in the late 1967 and early 1972 in the American Wrestling Association.

It is often used as the input phosphor of an X-ray image intensifier tube found in fluoroscopy equipment. Caesium iodide photocathodes are highly efficient at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. ==Synthesis and structure== Monatomic caesium halide wires grown inside double-wall carbon nanotubes. Bulk caesium iodide crystals have the cubic CsCl crystal structure, but the structure type of nanometer-thin CsI films depends on the substrate material – it is CsCl for mica and NaCl for LiF, NaBr and NaCl substrates. Caesium iodide atomic chains can be grown inside double-wall carbon nanotubes. In such chains I atoms appear brighter than Cs atoms in electron micrographs despite having a smaller mass. This difference was explained by the charge difference between Cs atoms (positive), inner nanotube walls (negative) and I atoms (negative). As a result, Cs atoms are attracted to the walls and vibrate more strongly than I atoms, which are pushed toward the nanotube axis. ==Properties== {|class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" |+Solubility of Csl in waterHaynes, p. 5.191 !Т (°C) !0 !10 !20 !25 !30 !40 !50 !60 !70 !80 !90 !100 |- |S (wt%) |30.9 |37.2 |43.2 |45.9 |48.6 |53.3 |57.3 |60.7 |63.6 |65.9 |67.7 |69.2 |} ==Applications== An important application of caesium iodide crystals, which are scintillators, is electromagnetic calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Pure CsI is a fast and dense scintillating material with relatively low light yield that increases significantly with cooling. It shows two main emission components: one in the near ultraviolet region at the wavelength of 310 nm and one at 460 nm. The drawbacks of CsI are a high temperature gradient and a slight hygroscopicity. Caesium iodide is used as a beamsplitter in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers. It has a wider transmission range than the more common potassium bromide beamsplitters, working range into the far infrared. However, optical-quality CsI crystals are very soft and hard to cleave or polish. They should also be coated (typically with germanium) and stored in a desiccator, to minimize interaction with atmospheric water vapors. In addition to image intensifier input phosphors, caesium iodide is often also used in medicine as the scintillating material in flat panel x-ray detectors. ==ReferencesCited sources== * Category:Caesium compounds Category:Iodides Category:Alkali metal iodides Category:Metal halides ","title":"Caesium iodide"},{"id":"2000926","text":"Gastineau Girls is an American reality series that made its debut on the E! cable channel in 2005.

The stable was originally composed of three anti-American, Canadian wrestlers: Lance Storm, Christian and Test. Towards the end of the Un- Americans existence, the trio was joined by British wrestler William Regal. ==History== The Un-Americans were formed on SmackDown! in June 2002 by the Canadian Lance Storm, who had led a similar stable known as Team Canada in World Championship Wrestling. Storm claimed that World Wrestling Entertainment had discriminated against Canadians for years, citing the Montreal Screwjob as an example. Christian (who had teamed with Storm regularly since the fall of the WCW/ECW Alliance) and Test, also Canadian, joined the burgeoning stable later that month. The stable was named \\"The Anti-Americans\\" shortly thereafter. In the lead-up to the formation of the group, each member had suffered a televised loss, decided by the ineptitude of the referee calling the match. Storm lost a tag team match when he used a Bridging German Suplex to pin his opponent Billy Kidman. Storm inadvertently put his own shoulders on the mat, forcing the referee to count a pinfall on both men. Storm managed to raise his shoulder off the mat before Kidman did, but the referee did not see this, and awarded the victory to Kidman's team. In the following weeks, Christian and Test were pinned by their opponents in matches, and the referee failed to see that they were touching the ring-ropes (thus invalidating the pin attempt). As indicated by the name, the Anti-Americans differed from previous incarnations of Team Canada in that they were anti-American rather than pro-Canadian. As a result of this, the emblem of the stable was not the Canadian flag, but an American flag flown upside down. In July, The Anti- Americans began feuding with wrestlers such as Rikishi, fellow Canadian Edge and Hollywood Hulk Hogan. At Vengeance on July 21, Storm and Christian defeated Edge and Hogan to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. They were assisted by Chris Jericho, another Canadian, who both proposed the match to Mr. McMahon, and helped them win it after striking Edge with one of the belts. However, Jericho did not formally join the stable and had only helped due to an ongoing feud with Edge. Original plans, according to Storm, were to have the four Canadians form a group called \\"C-4\\", but plans were scrapped before many details could be worked out. In fact, Jericho had jumped to Raw on the same day as the stable, but still did not join them, though he was sometimes regarded as an associate (especially with Christian). The Anti-Americans then jumped from SmackDown! to Raw on July 29, and immediately began a feud with The Undertaker. Up until this night, the WWE Tag Team Championship was only active on the SmackDown! brand. But when the stable moved to Raw, the titles moved too, forcing the creation of a second tag team championship. This was when Jim Ross started referring to the group as \\"The Un-Americans\\". They went on to feud with Booker T and Goldust, who Storm and Christian defeated to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam on August 25. Later that night, Undertaker defeated Test in a singles match. In late August and early September, The Un-Americans attempted on several occasions to burn the American flag, but were thwarted on each occasion by Booker, Goldust, Kane and Bradshaw. In mid-September, the English William Regal joined the stable. At Unforgiven on September 22, The Un-Americans lost to Booker, Goldust, Kane and Bubba Ray Dudley in an eight-man tag team match. The Un-Americans used an upside-down American flag, like the one seen here, as a logo Storm and Christian lost the WWE Tag Team Championship on the September 23 episode of Raw to Kane and The Hurricane. Following the match, both Storm and Christian blamed one another for the loss. One week later, Storm and Christian were both defeated in singles matches (by the same man, Randy Orton), and Test and Regal lost a tag team match to Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer. The series of losses divided The Un-Americans, and the stable split in brawling fashion. ===Post- split=== The stable continued as a tag team featuring Regal and Storm, retaining their anti-American sentiments, although with an emphasis on their respective English and Canadian heritage, regaining the (renamed) World Tag Team Championship on two occasions. Meanwhile, Test took on Stacy Keibler as a manager, and turned face. Christian went on to team with Jericho and serve as Jericho's side-kick and partner. It was commented by Michael Hayes during a segment of \\"The Legends of Wrestling\\" - Patriotism, that everyone in the Un- Americans were afraid of the \\"heat\\" brought on by the angle. Regal was remarked to be the only one who was not and due to that, the angle was short- lived. Storm later denied this claim. Both men split up in March 2003 after Regal got a heart parasite in India while WWE was on tour (thus permanently disbanding the team). Storm worked for the company until retiring from wrestling in April 2004. Test would stay with WWE until November 2004. He went to wrestle for other promotions in the United States, Nu-Wrestling in Italy, and World Series Wrestling in Australia. He returned to WWE in March 2006 and was released less than a year later. He died on March 13, 2009 of a drug overdose. Regal returned to wrestling in April 2004 and was the general manager of Raw from 2007 until 2008. He retired from wrestling in 2013. He has been the general manager of NXT since July 2014. Christian became a four time Intercontinental Champion winning his second (he won his first at Unforgiven in 2001, nine months before the stable's formation) at Judgment Day in May 2003. He stayed with the company until November 2005 when he went to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and became a main eventer winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions in 2006 and 2007. He left TNA in January 2009 after his contract expired and returned to WWE a month later. He won the ECW Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions each in 2009 and 2011 respectively.

It is one of the city's major landmarks and the mother cathedral of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate, one of two major Ukrainian Orthodox Churches. ==History and description== In 1852, Metropolitan Philaret of Moscow suggested a large cathedral should be built in Kyiv to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the baptism of Kyivan Rus by prince Vladimir I of Kyiv (St. Volodymyr). People from all over the Russian Empire started donating to this cause, so that by 1859 the cathedral fund had amassed a huge sum of 100,000 rubles. The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves) produced one million bricks and presented them to the cathedral as well. The design was executed in neo-Byzantine style initially by the architects I. Schtrom, P. Sparro, R. Bemhardt, K. Mayevsky, V. Nikolayev. The final version of the design belongs to Alexander Vikentievich Beretti. It is a traditional six-piered, three-apsed temple crowned by seven cupolas. The height to the cross of the main dome is . Interior view of the cathedral The colourful interior of the cathedral is particularly striking. Its mosaics were executed by masters from Venice. The frescoes were created under the guidance of Professor Adrian Prakhov by a group of famous painters: Wilhelm Kotarbiński, Mikhail Nesterov, Mykola Pymonenko, Pavel Svedomsky, Viktor Vasnetsov, Mikhail Vrubel, Viktor Zamyraylo (1868-1939), and others. The painting of the Holy Mother of God by Vasnetsov in the altar apse of the cathedral impresses by its austere beauty. The entrance door is adorned with relief bronze sculptures of St. Olga (Princess Olga of Kyiv) by sculptor Robert Bakh and St. Vladimir (sculptor H. Zaieman) against a blue background. The iconostasis is carved from the white marble brought from Carrara. The cathedral was completed in 1882, however, the paintings were fully completed only in 1896. St Volodymyr's Cathedral converted to an anti-religious museum in the early 1920s The cathedral risked damage during the Polish-Soviet War in 1920.http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1920-mil/ch38.htm During the Soviet period, the cathedral narrowly escaped demolition, but not closure. Until the Second World War it served as a museum of religion and atheism. The relics of St Barbara, a martyr of the 3rd century AD, were transferred to St Volodymyr's from the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery before it was destroyed by the Bolsheviks,http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/wumag_old/archiv/4_99/church.htm and have remained there since. St Volodymyr's Cathedral roof After the war the cathedral was reopened and since remained continually open. It was then the main church of the Kyiv Metropolitan See of the Ukrainian Exarchate. The cathedral was one of the few places in the USSR where tourists could openly visit a working Orthodox Church. It saw the revival of Orthodox religion in 1988 when the millennium celebration of the Baptism of Rus' marked a change in Soviet policy on religion. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, St Volodymyr's Cathedral ownership became an issue of controversy between two denominations that both claim to represent Ukrainian Orthodox Christianity - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, a church with an autonomous status under the Moscow Patriarchy, and the newly established Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchy, which, ultimately, won the control over the cathedral. Spiritual leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchy continue to conduct religious services and prayers in St. Volodymyr's Cathedral. All the ceremonies are conducted in Ukrainian, accompanied during religious holidays by the Cathedral choir, which is often joined by opera singers. == Works by Viktor Vasnetsov in the Cathedral== Image:Vasnetsov Russian Bishops.jpg|Russian Bishops Image:Vasnetsov Temptation.jpg|The Temptation Image:Kiev vasnetcov.jpg|The Baptism of Kyivans.

It has been described as \\"the single biggest popular hit to come out of any Rodgers and Hammerstein show.\\"Mast, Gerald. Can't Help Singin': The American Musical on Stage and Screen, Overlook Press (1987), p. 206, excerpted in: Block, Geoffrey. The Richard Rodgers Reader, p. 91, Oxford University Press (2006). Andrew Lloyd Webber describes it as the \\"greatest song ever written for a musical\\". The song is a three-verse solo for the leading male character, Emile, in which he describes first seeing a stranger, knowing that he will see her again, and dreaming of her laughter. He sings that when you find your \\"true love\\", you must \\"fly to her side, and make her your own, / Or all through your life you may dream all alone.\\" ==In South Pacific== The song appears in the first act of the musical. It is sung as a solo by the show's male lead, Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French expatriate who has become a plantation owner on a South Pacific island during World War II. Emile falls in love with Ensign Nellie Forbush, an optimistic and naive young American navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas. The two have known each other for only a few weeks, and each worries that the other may not return his or her love. In the song, Emile expresses his romantic feelings for Nellie, recalling how they met at an officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other. He describes a man seeing a stranger and instantly knowing he will see her again, hearing her laughter and dreaming of it. He says that when you find your \\"true love\\", you must \\"fly to her side, and make her your own\\"; otherwise, all your life you will \\"dream all alone\\". He later asks her to marry him. The song is then reprised several times during the show by Nellie and/or Emile as their relationship experiences setbacks and reconciliations. In the original Broadway production, \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" was sung by former Metropolitan Opera bass Ezio Pinza. Pinza won the Tony Award for Best Actor in 1950 for this role,South Pacific 1950 Tony winners, Tony Awards official website, accessed April 4, 2012 and the song made him a favorite with audiences and listeners who normally did not attend or listen to opera.Eaton, Quaintance. The Miracle of the Met: An Informal History of the Metropolitan Opera, 1883-1967. Greenwood Press, 1976. p. 227.

In the film version of South Pacific, the first and second scenes of the play are switched around. Because of the switch, Emile enters later in the film, and \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" is not heard until nearly 45 minutes into the film, while in the original stage version it is heard about 15 minutes after Act I begins.Pressley, Nelson. \\"An Era's Bias, Cast In Bali Ha'i Relief; With South Pacific, Arena Stage Takes On A Troubling Zeitgeist\\".

Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on, p. 132, Cengage Learning, 2008 Gerald Mast's history of the American musical notes that the song is a climactic moment which reveals that two characters have fallen in love, and it expresses a seize-the-opportunity lyric: \\"When you find your true love ... Then fly to her side / And make her your own\\". According to the running commentary on the 2006 Fox DVD release of the 1958 film version of South Pacific, Lehman Engel remembered that Oscar Hammerstein II wanted to write a song based around verbs but waited ten years to do so before he wrote this song, in which the verses are built around the verbs \\"see\\", \\"hear\\" and \\"fly\\".In the 2006 Fox DVD release of the 1958 film version, running commentary of the film is provided on the first disc by Ted Chapin and Gerard Alessandrini.

The limitanei, unlike the comitatenses, palatini, and scolae, garrisoned fortifications along the borders of the Roman Empire and were not normally expected to fight far from their fortifications. The limitanei were lower- status and lower-paid than the comitatenses and palatini,Treadgold 1995, pp. 149–157. and the distinction in role and status between scolae, palatini, comitatenses, and limitanei had largely replaced the older one between praetorians, legionaries, and auxiliaries.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp. 19, 35–37, 57. The limitanei and palatini both included legionary units alongside auxiliary units.Treadgold 1995, pp. 44–59. The nature of the limitanei changed considerably between their introduction in the 3rd or 4th century and their disappearance in the 6th or 7th century. In the 4th century, the limitanei were professional soldiers,Treadgold 1995, p. 161.Strobel 2011, p. 268.Southern & Dixon, 1996, p. 57. and included both infantry and cavalry as well as river flotillas,The Notitia Dignitatum. but after the 5th century they were part-time soldiers, and after the 6th century they were unpaid militia.Treadgold 1995, p. 60, for the pay cancellation but not the role.Southern & Dixon, 1996, p. 36. The role of the limitanei remains somewhat uncertain.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp. 29 and 33.

Edward Luttwak saw their role as a key part in a strategy of defence-in-depth in combination with the provincial field armies.Luttwak 1976, pp. 130–145. == Origins and history == Reconstructed Roman fortifications at Vindolanda. The limitanei would garrison similar forts around the Empire. Photo by Sam.roebuck. In the early 3rd century, the Roman military was organized into several provincial armies under the command of the provincial governors, a smaller reserve under the command of the emperor, guard units such as the Praetorian Guard, and the urban cohorts.Le Bohec, Yann, The Imperial Roman Army, pp. 19-35. Field armies were temporary formations, usually composed of the reserve and/or of detachments drawn from the provincial armies.Southern & Dixon 1996, pp. 9-11.Strobel 2011, pp. 269-271. In the later 3rd century, due to the frequent wars, field armies could remain together for several years, under the direct command of the emperor, and would require their own recruitment systems.Southern, Pat, and Dixon, Karen R., 1996, The Late Roman Army, pp. 9-14. By the mid 4th century, the Roman military was divided into frontier armies under the command of the provincial duces and permanent field armies under the command of the emperor, the magistri peditum, magistri equitum, or comites.Elton, 1996, pp. 208-210.Southern and Dixon, pp. 57-60 The frontier armies would patrol the borders and oppose small-scale raids.Treadgold1995, p. 93. They may have driven off medium-scale attacks without the support of the field armies.Southern & Dix, 1996, p. 65. The frontier armies would later be known as limitanei or ripenses.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp. 35-37. The earliest reference, from 325, distinguishes comitatenses, ripenses, and alares et cohortales, so certain lower-status frontier units were not counted as part of the ripenses though they would later be counted as part of the limitanei. The field armies would respond to larger-scale attacks, would fight against rival emperors, and would conduct any large-scale attacks into neighboring countries. The field armies would later be known as comitatenses or palatini.Elton, 1996, p. 94. The first known written reference to ripenses was in 325 and the first to limitanei was not until 363.Lee 2007, p. 11. Lee cites the Theodosian Code.Theodosian Code 7.20.4 and 12.1.56 Historians disagree on whether the emperor Diocletian, or one of his successors, such as Constantine I, split the Roman military into frontier armies and field armies.Southern & Dixon 1996, pp. 15-20.Lee 2007, pp. 10-12. Theodor Mommsen, H.M.D. Parker, and more recently, Warren Treadgold and David S. PotterD.S.Potter, The Roman Empire at Bay AD 180-395, pp. 451-453. Potter strongly doubts that the creation of ripenses could be attributed to a cooperation of Constantine with Licinius, therefore he dates it back to the reign of Diocletian. However he admits that there is no unequivocal evidence. attribute the reorganization to Diocletian.Treadgold 1995, p. 10.Southern & Dixon 1996, p. 15. E.C. Nischer, D. van Berchem, and more recently, M.C. Bishop and J.C.N. Coulston attribute mainly an expansion to Diocletian, and the reorganization to Constantine I and his successors.Bishop, M.C., and Coulston, J.C.N., 2006, Roman Military Equipment, From the Punic Wars to the Fall of Rome, p. 199.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp. 15 & 35. Karl Strobel sees the reorganization as the culmination of trends going back well into the 3rd century, with Diocletian strengthening both the frontier and field armies.Strobel 2011, p.p. 268-269. The division of the Roman Empire, the collapse of its western portion, and the formation of the successor states means that the limitanei may have developed differently in the east and the west, or even in different regions of the west. In the east, the emperor Justinian cancelled their pay.In 545. Treadgold 1995, pp. 60 and 97. After this, the eastern limitanei were no longer professional soldiers, but continued to exist as militia through the Persian Wars and the Arab Conquest.Treadgold 1995, pp. 97-98.Southern & Dixon, 1996, p. 36 The Arabic ajnad of Palestine, Jordan, Damascus, and Homs, may represent continuations of the commands of Palaestina, Arabia, Phoeniciae, and Syria. In the west, the collapse of the empire cut off regular pay. Peter Heather notes an incident in the Life of St. Severinus, in Noricum in the 460s, where raiders had intercepted and cut down limitanei who were bringing their pay to the rest of their unit.Heather, 2005, p. 412. ==Organization== The limitanei represented the largest part of the late Roman Army. The eastern portion of the Notitia Dignitatum, from about 395, may count some 195,500 personnel in the frontier armies not counting the river flotillas, 104,000 in the field armies not counting the fleets, and 3,500 in the palace guard. The western portion, from about 420, is harder to work with, because it has been unevenly edited, it omits some frontier provinces, and it includes British provinces which were probably lost to the Empire. The size of the army, and therefore of the limitanei, remains controversial.Lee 2007, pp. 74-79. A.H.M. Jones and Warren Treadgold argue that the late Roman army was significantly larger than earlier Roman armies, and Treadgold estimates they had up to 645,000 troops. Karl Strobel denies this, and Strobel estimates that the late Roman army had some 435,000 troops in the time of Diocletian and 450,000 in the time of Constantine I. The limitanei were usually under the command of the duces of their respective provinces. There were some exceptions, with comites commanding units of limitanei, and with duces commanding units from two or more provinces.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp.58-60. The units of the limitanei included legiones of infantry, often divided between two bases and sometimes divided among more, numeri, milites, and cohortes of infantry, as well as vexillationes, equites, cunei, and alae of cavalry. The size of the legions is unclear. A.H.M. Jones suggested that they could have as many as 3,000 troops, because they are often listed with 10 cohorts, and because they are sometimes divided among many bases. Warren Treadgold suggests that the legions probably had about 1,000 troops and the other units probably had about 500 troops each.Treadgold 1995, pp. 44-49. The different titles of numeri, milites, and cohorts, or vexillationes, equites, cunei, and alae, probably did not correspond with different structures or roles,Treadgold 1995, pp. 87-98. although according to Pat Southern and Karen Dixon, the legiones, auxilia, and cunei of the border armies were part of the limitanei, but higher-status than the older cohortes and alae in the same armies. Warren Treadgold estimates that 50.1% of the limitanei were infantry and 49.9% cavalry, not counting river flotillas. == Roles == The role of the limitanei remains somewhat uncertain. Neither Vegetius, writing in the late 4th or early 5th century, nor Mauricius, writing in the late 6th century, discuss the limitanei in their military manuals. This is understandable. Vegetius called for the revival of earlier Roman practices, from before the organization of the limitanei, and Mauricius wrote after the decline of the limitanei. Hugh Elton and Warren Treadgold suggest that, besides garrisoning fortifications along the frontier, they operated as border guards and customs police and to prevent small-scale raids. Hugh Elton describes their roles as \\"policing the border, gathering intelligence, and stopping raids.\\"Elton 1996, p. 204. They may have driven off medium-scale attacks without the support of the field armies. Edward Luttwak saw their role as a key part in a strategy of defence-in-depth, manning a range of defences from forts to walled towns in a deep defensive zone. These defences would deny routes to the enemy, securing food stocks and, in arid areas, water supplies both to restrict attackers and facilitate counterattack by provincial field armiesLuttwak 1976, pp. 130-145 Because units of limitanei operated in one area, had their own camps, and often recruited from the same area, they tended to maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.Lee 2007, p. 175.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp. 169-170, 171-174. They were light troops and served as a policing force to patrol Rome's distant, far-flung border regions and when necessary, to delay advancing enemy forces until counter-attacks could be arranged. They worked in conjunction with the comitatenses.Christon I. Archer, et al., World History of Warfare. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002), 99-100 ===Pseudocomitatenses=== The relationship between the limitanei, of the border armies, and the pseudocomitatenses, the lowest-ranking units of the field armies, remains unclear. Theodor Mommsen proposed that the pseudocomitatenses were former units of limitanei incorporated into the mobile field armies,Nischer, pp. 30-31. and most authors since have followed his theory.For example, A.H.M. Jones, Hugh Elton, Pat Southern, and Karen Dixon.Elton, pp. 95 and 212.Southern and Dixon, pp. 19 and 37. E.C. Nischer proposed the alternate theory that the pseudocomitatenses were positional garrison units which were independent of the border armies and thus placed under the same command as the field armies.Nischer, pp. 30-41. ===Farmer-soldiers=== In the past historians have suggested that the limitanei were organized as units of part-time farmer- soldiers. In this view, the limitanei were used in stationary roles along the frontier and were granted plots of land to cultivate, which essentially turned them into part-time soldiers/farmers.Luttwak 1976, p.171. It was usually assumed that over time the limitanei settled down more permanently in their posts and became farmers and land owners as well as soldiers; raising families and earning a living from agricultural means rather than purely military service. It is now more generally assumed that there is no good evidence for this.Isaac 1988, pp. 125-147 The current consensus seems to be that the limitanei were organized as units of professional soldiers,Strobel 2011, p. 268. Strobel notes a law of 458 which still prohibited farming and herding by the soldiers.Whitby 2011, pp. 522-523.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp. 35-37, 57. but they gradually became part-time soldiers and eventually an unpaid militia,Treadgold, Warren, Byzantium and Its Army, 284-1081, p. 60, for the pay cancellation but not the role. relying on other professions including farming for income. Why this new class of soldiers developed is disputed by historians. According to Azar Gat, many scholars believe that empires stationed these soldiers on the outskirts of empires as a first line of defense against raiding barbarians tribes. As the soldier profession is often not productive (prolonged periods of training with only occasional conflict), empires had long resorted to this principle of \\"military colonists.\\" Thus, the late Roman empire adopted the system of limitanei (frontier-colonist-soldier) for economic reasons. By employing soldiers in this way, Rome was able to capitalize on their knowledge of warfare as well benefit from the agriculture produced by limitanei. Edward Luttwak, however, sees the change as due a strategic shift away from a firmly held frontier (preclusive defence) to a less firmly held frontier zone backed with mobile forces (defence-in-depth) as responsible for the change,Luttwak 1976, pp. 191-194. though again referencing parallels of military colonists at other times in history.Luttwak 1976, pp. 171-172 == Equipment == M.C. Bishop and J.C.N. Coulston, in a major work on Roman military equipment, do not distinguish that of the limitanei from that of the comitatenses and palatini. It is doubtful whether there were any universal differences between the equipment of the limitanei and of the other forces. The late Roman empire had centralized fabricae, introduced by Diocletian, to provide arms and armor for the army.Bishop & Coulston 2006, pp. 233-240.Michel Feugère, 2002, Weapons of the Romans, pp. 185-193. He dates this to the time of Diocletian, based on John Malalas's quoting one of Lactantius's works.Southern & Dixon, 1996, pp. 89-91.Elton, 1996, pp. 116-117. The 4th century limitanei included both light and heavy infantry, as well as light and heavy cavalry, and river flotillas. ==Fortifications== The limitanei garrisoned fortifications along the borders of the Roman empire. Hugh Elton divides these into four categories: \\"garrison forts, detachment forts, watchtowers, and fortified landing places.\\"Elton 1996, p. 158. These fortifications could be organized into lines along rivers, such as the Rhine and Danube, or at times part of the Euphrates, along fortified walls such as Hadrian's Wall, or along otherwise unfortified roads such as the Strata Diocletiana. Garrison forts are those at or near the towns along the frontiers, as well as other forts, garrisoned by independent units of limitanei. Detachment forts are those too small for independent units, garrisoned by detachments from the nearest garrison fort. Fortified landing places are those on the opposite side of riverine borders.Elton 1996, p. 160. Both Diocletian and Constantine I reinforced the frontier fortifications.Southern & Dixon 1996, pp. 23-37. The fort of Deutz/Divitia, an important bridgehead on the east bank of the Rhine, was built in this period.Southern & Dixon 1996, p. 33. Generally speaking there were more and smaller forts along the late Roman border than along the earlier Roman imperial borders. This has been interpreted as evidence that units were smaller than before, that units were divided among multiple forts, or both. ==Effectiveness== The effectiveness of the limitanei, as units, and as part of the larger system, remains controversial. The soldiers of the frontier armies were paid less than their counterparts in the field armies. However, this does not imply that the field armies always hired the most promising recruits; some may have preferred to stay close to home rather than to join units which could be deployed anywhere else. The soldiers of the frontier armies are often supposed to have been part-time farmer-soldiers without the same degree of training as the soldiers of the field armies; however, they were originally full-time soldiers. Although these military reforms brought about a more effective defensive army than the previous arrangement had, it did have its pitfalls. Constantine I was criticised for allowing what were perceived as \\"second-class\\" infantry, often recruited from non-Roman backgrounds, to be given the responsibility of watching over Rome's most troublesome regions. The elite Comitatenses and Scholae Palatinae (the personal bodyguards of the late Roman Emperors such as Constantine I) resented being reduced to trivial home guard duties and acting more similarly to an urban police force until such a time that a serious enough threat presented itself at a nearby border, when they were called upon for duty. They are historically significant in that their appearance, as part of a plan of military reforms enacted in the late 3rd century, was able to extend the life of the Roman Empire by pushing back the great barbarian invasions of late antiquity. The quality of these border troops declined because the limitanei had to live in poor conditions in impoverished and isolated towns, unlike their well-off counterparts the comitatenses, who were typically assigned to more urban and prosperous areas of the empire. This affected the discipline and morale of the late Roman army. The limitanei were nonetheless a fairly well equipped and trained force of infantry for their time, especially in relation to other standing armies of the day fielded by Rome's Germanic, Celtic, Iranian, and Eastern neighbours, collectively referred to as \\"barbarians\\" by the Romans themselves. It can be surmised, due in part to these reforms, that the Roman Empire continued to live on for another 140 years after the end of Constantine's reign, in the face of numerous migrations and invasions from northern and eastern, nomadic peoples such as the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Sarmatians, Alans, Burgundians, Saxons and Franks, which continually weakened the Empire until its eventual collapse in 476 AD. ==See also== * Akritai * Marzoban == Notes  References  Citations = Sources === ; Primary sources * The Notitia Dignitatum * The work of Ammianus Marcellinus ; Secondary sources * M.C.

It complemented the defense of Muscat Square, which was one of its first and most important defenses. It was part of a serial of fortified cities that the Portugal had to control the access to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, like Khor Fakan, Muscat, Sohar, Seeb, Qurayyat and Muttrah. It is demolished, at its former place today stands the Muscat International Airport. The Seeb is famous for being the location in which the Treaty of Seeb agreement took place between the Imamate of Oman and the Sultanate of Muscat on 25 September 1920. This treaty divided Oman into two distinct regions, the interior and the coast, which were separated historically by the Al Hajar Mountains. ==Intelligence gathering== In June 2014 The Register disclosed that Seeb is the location of a \\"beyond top secret\\" GCHQ internet monitoring site. ==Sports== Al-Seeb Club and Al-Shabab are located in Seeb. ==Climate== Seeb has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with very hot summers and warm winters.

In Southern Ontario it may be called a stag and doe, or buck and doe, and in Northwestern Ontario it is called a shag. In Manitoba, this is often called a social or wedding social with less fundraising pressure than seen in Ontario. The event is usually organized by the bridal party, but in some circumstances may also be held by the bride and groom before they are married, similar to a Jack & Jill. It acts as a fundraiser for the wedding. Guests purchase entrance tickets and are entertained by draws, food and drink, music and fun and games that they will pay for to participate in. It is not a combined stag night/bachelor party and bachelorette party, or engagement party, as the primary focus is to raise money for the engaged couple, so their new life together is not started in debt. The intent of a stag and doe party is specifically to make a profit. Often, people who may not be close enough to the engaged couple to warrant an invitation to the wedding or reception (especially in the case of a small wedding), will be \\"tapped\\" to attend the stag and doe so as to be part of the overall wedding fundraising. Hosting a stag and doe party does not preclude the couple from participating in other wedding-related parties, such as a bridal shower, bachelor party, bachelorette party, and so on. A popular stag and doe tradition is a toonie toss, which has guests toss toonies ( coins) at a Texas mickey (3L) bottle of liquor. The toss runs for some time until the Toonie closest to the bottle without making contact wins the bottle. In Manitoba, in addition to purchasing entrance tickets, guests bid on silent auction prizes, participate in a 50-50 draw, and purchase liquor. Typical food at a Manitoba wedding social includes KUB bread, cold cuts, cheese cubes, and Timbits.Cherniack, Lawrie, and Cy Fien. \\"Common Law Marriages in Manitoba.\\" Man. LJ 6 (1974): 85. Often the bridal or wedding shower is held the afternoon before the social. Other times, it is used as a fundraiser for the wedding itself and will be held a few weeks before the day of the wedding. ===Other countries=== An uncommon event borrowed from the tradition of Canada, and only held in small pockets of certain US States.

SPV also released a limited edition containing a bonus DVD with the complete video material of the concert that was previously released on their album Rebirth World Tour – Live in São Paulo. The record was classified as the 21th best power metal album of all time by the metal magazine Loudwire. ==Track listing Story == The 13 tracks tell a story written by guitarist Rafael Bittencourt about the life of a crusader in the 11th century - known as The Shadow Hunter - questioning the ideals of the Catholic Church. * \\"Deus Le Volt!\\", Spread Your Fire: The story starts as a man, later named the Shadow Hunter, is chosen by God as a Jewish Rabbi tells him his fate. * \\"Angels and Demons\\": As he accepts his destiny, the Shadow Hunter goes off to spread a new belief, against the teachings of the Catholic Church, who define him as a heretic. * \\"Waiting Silence\\": As time passes, the Shadow Hunter falls in love with a Muslim lady and has two sons. He is conflicted by his choice between filling out his destiny or living a normal life. As his anxiety builds, the Crusaders of the Roman Catholic Church attack the city the family lives in. * \\"Wishing Well\\": Completely separate from the coming battle, this vignette carries through the Shadow Hunter's mind, as the Rabbi's voice constantly replays itself, telling him \\"No matter where you throw your coins, whether it be in a church or a well, it's your faith! If there is a God, he has no home: He is everywhere!\\" * \\"Temple of Hate\\": Jerusalem is stormed by an army of the Holy Roman Church, in correspondence with the real event occurring in July 1099, and overcome with their zeal for Christianity, annihilate every single inhabitant. The Shadow Hunter's wife and two children are killed in this attack. The Reign of Jerusalem was founded upon the fanatic, intolerant and ignorant ideals of The Temple of Hate, against the will of those who lived in the Holy Land before their invasion. > \\"The entire population of the Holy city was put to the sword, Jews as well > as Muslims, 70,000 men, women and children perished in a holocaust which > raged for three days. In places men waded in blood up to their ankles and > horsemen were splashed by it as they rode through the streets. Weeping, > these devout conquerors went barefoot to pray at the Holy Sepulcher before > rushing eagerly back to the slaughter.\\" - Desmond Sweard, The Monks of War. * \\"The Shadow Hunter\\": The Shadow Hunter continues his travels and runs across a Gypsy prostitute. Instead of giving him pleasure, she reads him cards, telling him love will drag him from his path. The Shadow Hunter, seeking answers to questions that plague him, is even more baffled by the woman. At this point, he also discovers the death of his family. * \\"No Pain for the Dead\\": Continuing from the previous song, The Shadow Hunter buries his family, overcome with loss and sadness, but is comforted by knowing they are free from mortal suffering and emotions. He then questions whether all this has been worth doing. * \\"Winds of Destination\\": Some time passes and he ends up in the assault of Xerigordon Fortress, held up by Kilij Arslan. During the conquest of Xerigordon Fortress, The Shadow Hunter is injured and has to run away to escape from the troops of Kilij Arslan. Losing blood, he collapses before getting back to Constantinople. While unconscious, he dreams about the lost scrolls hidden in the ruins of the Temple of Solomon and inside lost caves by the Dead Sea. * \\"Sprouts of Time\\": The Shadow Hunter starts a new religion, gathering people around him to spread the truth revealed for him. Words of peace and love were sown like seeds in the hearts of the wise, but fruitlessly dropped on the rocky soil of the hearts of the blind. The future is a consequence of what we do now. The present exposes the Sprouts of Time to everyone. It is unclear whether this actually happens, or if he is hallucinating this event, as the next song states that he is just waking up. * \\"Morning Star\\": When he wakes up, two Muslim men are carrying him away on a type of hammock hanging on a long piece of wood. Weak and frightened, he can't react. Right above his head, while the sun is dawning, the Morning Star shines in the new day's sky. The six-pointed star presents a cross and the trident together as one. He understands the first sign given to him by the Rabbi as the wolves are howling. At that very moment, the first prophecy is accomplished. He will find out later that the two men are brothers. Inside, their sister, named Laura, will tend to his wounds. As he finds strength to move again, the Shadow Hunter waits for dawn as it seems the Morning Star is giving him the chance to decide whether he lives or dies. * \\"Late Redemption\\": On his deathbed, whether it is immediately after this or some time in the future, the Shadow Hunter is still in doubt about the long journey which has brought him here; he remains beset by the questions: \\"Was I right? Was I wrong?\\" Memories and thoughts twist his mind. As death approaches, the Hunter is visited by angels - or are they demons? Who knows? How can the purest heart judge evil? The Angel of Death stretches his arms and offers a comfortable eternal silence. The Shadow Hunter delivers his body and soul, sure of his Late Redemption. * \\"Gate XIII\\" is an orchestral instrumental, reprising riffs, progressions, and other musical themes from many of the other songs, symbolizing that as life lives by taking the lives of others, one life ends, more life begins.

He studied at the University of Uppsala where he attended courses taught by Carl Linnaeus. When the Spanish ambassador asked Linnaeus to select a botanist for service in the American colonies, the professor at once named Loefling. He went to Spain in 1751 to learn Spanish, and then embarked with other scientists for South America in February 1754. In Cumana (actual Venezuela) he had entire charge of the department of natural history, and was assisted by two young Spanish doctors. He died in San Antonio de Caroni (Guayana, Venezuela). His death was considered a great loss to natural history, and especially to botany. Linnæus believed the loss irreparable. The manuscripts of Löfling, which were found after his death, were preserved by his two assistants. ==Legacy== Linnæus used the name Loeflingia for the genus of some plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, one species of which grows in Spain and the other in Spanish America.

The floating leg of an interest rate swap typically resets against a published index. The floating leg of a constant maturity swap fixes against a point on the swap curve on a periodic basis. A constant maturity swap is an interest rate swap where the interest rate on one leg is reset periodically, but with reference to a market swap rate rather than LIBOR. The other leg of the swap is generally LIBOR, but may be a fixed rate or potentially another constant maturity rate. Constant maturity swaps can either be single currency or cross currency swaps. Therefore, the prime factor for a constant maturity swap is the shape of the forward implied yield curves. A single currency constant maturity swap versus LIBOR is similar to a series of differential interest rate fixes (or \\"DIRF\\") in the same way that an interest rate swap is similar to a series of forward rate agreements. Valuation of constant maturity swaps depend on volatilities of different forward rates and therefore requires a stochastic yield curve model or some approximated methodology like a convexity adjustment, see for example Brigo and Mercurio (2006). == Example == A customer believes that the six-month LIBOR rate will fall relative to the three-year swap rate for a given currency.

The first series was recorded at the former ATV studios in Elstree, the second at their Nottingham facility. ==Premise== Luna was also the name used by the show's central character, played by Patsy Kensit (1st series) and by Jo Wyatt (2nd series). Luna was co-written by Colin Prockter and Colin Bennett; Bennett also acted in it. The show was created and produced by Micky Dolenz of the pop group the Monkees. Dolenz said that the idea for Luna dated back to the late sixties and was based on his daughter Ami; the idea only came into being after he had met Colin Bennett in Hollywood. The character 80H was played by Roy Macready and U2 by Bob Goody. The show was about the domestic life of an eccentric family group set in the year 2040 - although in the setting the characters are not in fact biologically related but assigned to shared living quarters by the bureaucracy. Parts of the setting were decidedly dystopic; in the first episode, Luna is threatened with execution for having lost her citizen's identity card. A distinctive feature of the show was the language of \\"techno-talk\\", used by all of the characters and described as an alternative version of English that had emerged to make it easier for computers to understand human speech. Techno-talk was characterised by the formation of new words from stems that already existed in regular spoken English. It also had echoes of George Orwell's Newspeak, albeit that it had been created for a different purpose. For example, the characters live in a \\"habiviron\\" (from habitat and environment); similarly, school is \\"eduviron\\"; a child is a \\"diminibeing\\" (abbreviated to \\"dimini\\") and \\"regrets!\\" and \\"gratitudes!\\" replace \\"sorry\\" and \\"thank you\\". The first season was repeated in the weeks immediately prior the broadcast of the second season, but the programme has not been repeated since then. ==Characters== *Luna (Season 1: 72-batch-19Y) - a female \\"diminibeing\\" (actually two different characters - the habiviron is assigned a new diminifemale in season two, but she adopts the same name as her predecessor). Luna is kind and demure; having been raised in a \\"dimini colony\\", she knows very little about the old world but is curious to learn about it and keen to fit in with the others. Andy likes her for the \\"civilising influence\\" she brings to the habiviron. Luna was given her name by Andy, because she asked for one; Andy chose it because she was \\"batched\\" on the moon. *Brat (3G-batch-19Y) - a geeky male diminibeing. Brat is younger than Luna, and extremely intelligent and technical; he can fix most of the machines in the habiviron if necessary. Unfortunately, he is also extremely spoiled and selfish; he has made attempts to have both Andy and Luna replaced (Andy with a newer model android and Luna with a male diminibeing). He is also ignorant about the old world, but unlike Luna, he actively refuses to learn about it or co-operate with the adults; he even persistently insists on using code numbers to identify the other characters (calling Luna \\"72\\" and Andy \\"CB\\"). Brat was given his name by Gramps during one of their arguments; neither he nor Luna actually knows what the word means. *Gramps (WB1889U) - an aging punk, and the original inhabitant of Habiviron Jo-Y. He grew up in the old world and often has difficulty understanding the other characters' use of techno-talk, which he hardly ever uses himself (Andy generally translates for him). He does not particularly like having to share his habiviron with diminibeings, but tolerates them regardless. He has a large stash of old world artifacts (such as teapots, rubik cubes, Monopoly games, etc.) in his bedroom, which are now considered illegal. He never uses code numbers, and cannot even remember his own; he introduces himself to Brat and Luna as \\"Gramps\\". *Andy (CB1979D) - the habiviron's malfunction-prone android. Andy is an outdated model of android; the habiviron is entitled to receive a newer one, but Gramps keeps Andy around since he knows Andy will tolerate his \\"inefficient\\" ways. Andy is familiar with the old world, and frequently quotes from Shakespeare or other historical literature, which most of the other characters (even Gramps) don't recognize. Andy was given his name by Gramps, because he is an android; he also uses the name \\"CB\\". *Mother (1984726SD) - the habiviron's computer, who runs all the standard functions of the habiviron and keeps Andy charged. Mother is Andy's nickname for her, she hates it. *Jazzmine - Luna's alien pet; a \\"little simple\\" (from the planet Sim). Luna rescued Jazzmine from mistreatment at the hands of a travelling junk trader. Although unable to speak, Jazzmine can perform some complex tasks, and has healing powers. *80H - the sector \\"bureaubeing\\". 80H is in charge of the whole sector, including resource allocation and law enforcement, and has ultimate power (including the power of life and death) over every being in the sector. He's addressed as \\"your burificence\\" and his arrival at the habiviron is always proceeded by a fanfare provided by Mother; he wears a shiny black suit with a black full-face helmet and speaks in a harsh ring-modulated voice. Underneath the helmet, though, is a regular, balding and stressed-out office worker; he finds the helmet uncomfortable and only wears it when required by official business. 80H is in fact quite kindly (albeit somewhat of a jobsworth) and, like most of the adult characters, remembers and has a certain amount of affection for the old world; unfortunately, the demands of his employers (\\"the central bureaubureau\\") often conflict with this. Many of the other adult characters appear to have known him in the old world, and still use his old name (\\"Sid\\"), which he hates. *40D - 80H's ditzy assistant (1st season). *32C - 80H's assistant (2nd season). ==EpisodesSeries One=== *Ep1 - Habiviron, Sweet Habiviron: Brat, and later Luna, arrive at the habiviron. Gramps is rather upset at having to share his home with children (and particularly dislikes Brat), and is already in trouble with 80H for having been caught with an old world teapot, which is now illegal to possess. When 80H visits to check on the new arrivals, Luna finds she's lost her egothenticity card; Andy attempts to hide this from 80H, but fails and 80H tells Luna she will need to show him the card within 24 hours or be \\"obliviated\\". Andy and Luna search for the card, but find no help: the sector's lost property officer insists that it cannot be lost because he doesn't know where it is, and the sector police suggest it may have been stolen but refuse to help because Luna cannot prove her identity (due to not having her card). Gramps is summoned to 80H's, where he appeals to \\"Sid\\" to have one last cup of tea; 80H relents, but afterwards the illegal teapot is thrown into the obliviator. Gramps rails angrily at the idea that 80H would do this to Luna, and 80H admits he does not relish the task, but is required to follow instructions to the letter. Time runs out, and Luna visits 80Hs to report on this; the obliviator door is opened for her to enter, when Brat runs up, holding the card to give to 80H. Brat reports that the card was \\"in the secret pouch in Luna's zipclad\\", but it is strongly implied that Brat stole it and later regretted this. Luna is saved, and 80H puts the card under his chair to stop it wobbling. *Ep2 - The Clunkman Cometh: \\"The Clunkman\\", a junk merchant, visits the habiviron. Brat plans to sell him Andy in exchange for a robot goldfish, knowing that a new android will be supplied; however, Luna intervenes to prevent this. She is also shocked at The Clunkman's treatment of his pet alien; so much so that, after he has left, she teleports onto his ship and kidnaps the alien, naming it Jazzmine. The Clunkman goes to visit 80H to report the missing alien; 80H is suffering from toothache, and cannot believe Luna would do such a thing, but he agrees to investigate anyway (in exchange for some contraband old world sweets). Brat reports Jazzmine's presence at the habiviron to 80H, who tells Luna that aliens cannot legally be kept in a static habiviron and goes to get the Clunkman to pick her up. When he arrives, Luna begs 80H to allow Jazzmine to stay, and Jazzmine uses her healing powers to cure 80H's toothache. 80H agrees that she can stay, but the Clunkman still insists that she belongs to him, and thus wants her back or else to be given something in exchange. He initially wants Andy, but he eventually accepts one of Gramps' old world LPs. *Ep3 - All The World's A Teletalk Linkup *Ep4 - Happy Batch Day Dear Luna *Ep5 - Environmental Ambience Stable, Wish You Were Here: Luna is feeling bored, and Andy proposes going on holiday. To do this the group need to get travel permits from 80H, but he is only too happy to provide them, since the Assistant Galactic Coordinator is visiting the sector for a random inspection and he is concerned he would find their habiviron \\"inefficient\\". They arrange their plans, but 80H learns that the Coordinator will be visiting earlier than expected, and therefore gives the group permits for the earlier time, leaving their bookings unusable and no time to make earlier ones. Gramps suggests that they could go camping instead, and Brat produces a model VW Beetle which can be converted into a full-size car for them to drive in. Unfortunately, they then find that Jazzmin has no travel permit, and 80H cannot get her one, since technically she is not permitted to be in the habiviron at all. 40D agrees to substitute one of hers, and the group prepares to leave, only to find that car does not work; Brat had no idea that cars needed petrol, which is no longer available. As a last resort, the group decide to camp inside the Habiviron. The Assistant Coordinator arrives in the habiviron as part of his random inspection, and 80H nearly passes out when he sees what's going on, but in fact he's happy to join in. *Ep6 - When Did You Last See Your Pater Batch Mix Doner ===Series Two=== *Ep1 - You Can't Judge a Videotalker by its Blurb *Ep2 - Go Forth and Quadruplicate *Ep3 - The Happiest Earth Revolves of Your Span *Ep4 - It Isn't How You Vict or Slunk But How You Co-participate *Ep5 - A Bureaubreau In The Hand Is Worth A Pension *Ep6 - You're Only As Multi-Tocked As You Perceive ==Converted songs== Many of the episodes of Luna feature \\"techno talk\\" versions of classic or music hall songs.

It was designed for both carrier- and land- based operations. ==Design and development== Grumman's success with the two- seat FF-1, which was significantly faster than even the single-seat fighters of its time, resulted in a contract for the single-seat XF2F-1.Jordan, Corey C. \\"Grumman's Ascendency: Chapter Two.\\" Planes and Pilots Of World War Two, 2000. Retrieved: 22 July 2011. Armed with two .30 caliber (7.62 mm) machine guns above the cowl, the new design also incorporated watertight compartments to reduce weight and improve survivability in the event of a water landing. The prototype first flew on 18 October 1933, equipped with the experimental XR-1534-44 Twin Wasp Junior radial engine, and reached a top speed of at – faster than the FF-1 at the same altitude. Maneuverability also proved superior to the earlier two-seat aircraft. Three F2F-1s in service with fighter squadron VF-2B ==Operational history== The Navy ordered 54 F2F-1 fighters on 17 May 1934, with the first aircraft delivered 19 January 1935. One additional aircraft (BuNo 9997) was ordered to replace one which crashed on 16 March 1935, bringing the total to 55, with the final F2F-1 delivered on 2 August 1935. The F2F-1 had a relatively long service life for the time, serving in front-line squadrons from 1935 to late 1939, when squadrons began to receive the F3F-3 as a replacement. By September 1940, the F2F had been completely replaced in fighter squadrons and was relegated to training and utility duties. The last F2F-1s were stricken from the list of naval aircraft in early 1943. ==Variants== ;XF2F-1 :United States Navy designation for the Grumman Model G-8 prototype with a XR-1534-44 Twin Wasp Junior radial engine, one built ;F2F-1 :Production variant with a R-1535-72 Twin Wasp Junior radial engine, 55 built ==Operators== ; * United States Navy **VF-2B **VF-3B **VF-5B **VB-5B **VF-2 **VF-5 **VF-7 **NAS Seattle **NAS Coco Solo **NAS Alameda **NAS Pearl Harbor * United States Marine Corps **VF-4M **VMF-2 ==Specifications (Grumman F2F-1)== Three-view drawing of Grumman F2F-1 ==See alsoReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * Cacutt, Len, ed. “Grumman Single-Seat Biplane Fighters.” Great Aircraft of the World.

Ryngold or Ringaudas was a mythological Grand Duke of Lithuania from the Palemonids legends and supposed father of Mindaugas, the first King of Lithuania (1251–1263). In fact there is nothing known about Mindaugas' father from reliable sources. The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, a contemporary source, just mentions that he was a powerful duke, but does not provide his name. Ryngold, son of otherwise unknown Algimantas, is first mentioned in the second redaction of the Lithuanian Chronicle written c. 1515 and has no historical basis. In the chronicle Ryngold returned to Navahrudak after a victorious battle with the Mongols on the bank of the Neman River at Mohilna near Minsk. This battle could have some historical basis as Mongols did invade Lithuania, but it happened in late 1230s and early 1240s. However, it is known for a fact that at the time Mindaugas already had supreme power in Lithuania. The legendary account claimed that Ryngold fathered three sons. He left Navharudak to one of his sons, Vaišvilkas. However, it is known from reliable contemporary sources that Vaišvilkas was son of Mindaugas. Therefore the third redaction of the Lithuanian Chronicle, also known as the Bychowiec Chronicle, made Ryngold father of Mindaugas to correct this clear contradiction. This legendary version was popularized by Maciej Stryjkowski and other medieval historians, and it still survives to this day. ==See also== * Palemonids – legendary dynasty of Ryngold * House of Mindaugas – historical family tree of Mindaugas * List of early Lithuanian dukes ==References== Category:Lithuanian nobility Category:Legendary rulers ","title":"Ryngold"},{"id":"2001058","text":"Ronald Allen Reis (born 1970) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling between 1995 and 1998 under the ring names The Yeti and Reese. ==Early life== Ron Reis is the son of Ron Reis, Sr., who was a member of National Collegiate Athletic Association title-winning basketball teams in 1961 and 1962 while studying at the University of Cincinnati. Reis attended Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, California. He played on the school's basketball team, scoring 2,082 points and competing in the 1987 Central Coast championship. Reis went on to attend Santa Clara University, where he played basketball for four years. ==Professional wrestling careerEarly career (1994-1995)=== Ron Reis was trained by Big John Studd. He made his professional debut on March 12, 1994 for the New England-based International Wrestling Federation under his birth name. In 1995, Reis began performing for the Las Vegas-based National Wrestling Conference as \\"SWAT\\". ===World Championship Wrestling (1995-1998)=== Reis debuted in World Championship Wrestling on Monday Nitro, October 23, 1995, as The Yeti - the Dungeon of Doom's so-called \\"insurance policy\\" for the upcoming WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between Dungeon member The Giant and current champion Hulk Hogan at Halloween Havoc 1995. Initially introduced (supposedly) frozen inside a block of ice, the Yeti soon broke out of the ice to reveal a heavily bandaged appearance reminiscent of a huge mummy and went on to interfere in the Halloween Havoc 1995 main event, where he and The Giant attacked Hulk Hogan with a double-bearhug. Reis wore lifts in his boots at the event and had bandages wrapped high on his head, which gave the effect of The Yeti appearing noticeably taller than The Giant (in reality Reis is only around an inch taller than Wight) and caused an astonished Tony Schiavone to remark \\"The Yeti is taller than The Giant!\\". Following Halloween Havoc, The Yeti's ring attire was changed to resemble a masked ninja. However Reis only made three more appearances as the character; as an entrant in the 60-man battle royal at World War 3 1995, in a match against Barry Houston on WCW Prime, and in a match against WCW United States Heavyweight Champion One Man Gang on WCW Saturday Night in January 1996, where Reis' character was renamed The Super Giant Ninja. This would be the final appearance of the character. Reis later became known as Big Ron Studd in 1996, and WCW announcers billed Reis as having taken the surname of his trainer Big John Studd. Bobby Heenan, who had managed John Studd, however, disdained Ron in his column in WCW Magazine. WCW primarily used Studd as an enhancement talent. On October 21, 1996 edition of Nitro he was defeated by Jeff Jarrett. On the March 2, 1998 edition of Nitro, Reis joined Raven's Flock as Reese. Raven claimed that Reis' size had made him an outcast from society, leading him to seek acceptance within the Flock. Reis acted as Raven's enforcer, though he was unable to prevent Goldberg defeating Raven for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. He also suffered a loss to Juventud Guerrera at the 1998 Great American Bash. Reese's last appearance was on the June 29, 1998 episode of Nitro. Saturn pinned Reese with a Death Valley Driver. ===Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling and Japan=== After being released, Reis toured Japan as Big Bomb Jones (a take on Big Van Vader) throughout 2002. In 2003, he returned to America and began working for Dusty Rhodes Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling promotion, returning to the Big Ron Studd gimmick. He formed a tag team with Glacier, and they won the TCW Tag Team Championships on January 3, 2004. The titles were vacated later that year. Reis reemerged in Vince Russo's Christian-orientated Ring Of Glory Wrestling promotion in 2005 as the abstract character Evil, losing to Joshua the Carpenter on February 26. ==Filmography== *Shadow Warriors II: Hunt for the Death Merchant (1999) as \\"Vlassi\\" ==Championships and accomplishments== *Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling **TCW Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Glacier ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1970 births Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:Basketball players from California Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Fictional mummies Category:Fictional ninja Category:Living people Category:People from Cumming, Georgia Category:Professional wrestlers from California Category:Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from San Jose, California Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Ron Reis"},{"id":"2001060","text":"Joe Amisano (1917–2008) was an American architect, especially known for his work in Atlanta.

Verdict of Twelve is set in England in the late 1930s (Hitler, Nazism and in particular anti-Semitism are referred to several times). Up to the final pages of the novel, till after the trial is over, the reader does not know if the defendant—a middle-aged woman charged with murder—is innocent or not. ==Plot summaryThe case== Rosalie van Beer is a widowed, childless woman who comes into money when all the relatives of her late husband unexpectedly die in a plane crash. The only surviving member of the family is her 11-year-old nephew Philip, and van Beer considers herself to be his “natural guardian”. She moves into the house in Devon that was built by her father-in-law and leads a quiet life there with Philip, a sickly child for whom she engages a private tutor. The household is run by an older couple who were devoted to their former employer but who dislike, and cheat on, Rosalie van Beer. It soon turns out that Philip is a difficult child, and that he does not get along with his aunt at all. The situation escalates when van Beer takes away Philip's pet rabbit, which he called Sredni Vashtar (the name of a weasel in a Saki short story, which kills a cruel aunt), and gasses it in the kitchen. When, soon afterwards, the boy is taken ill the old country doctor is unable to diagnose his disease correctly, and Philip dies before another physician can be consulted. When poison is found in the boy's vomit the police are alerted. Then Philip's tutor comes forward and tells the police that he saw a newspaper clipping about exactly such a case of poisoning in one of the books in the library. As Rosalie van Beer stands to inherit the family fortune, her motive seems to be obvious, and she is charged with murder. At first, when the jury retires to the jury room, about half of them, including the two women, consider the defendant guilty. However, as time progresses, they can all be convinced by the others that there is reasonable doubt that Rosalie van Beer has committed premeditated murder. In the end, their verdict is one of acquittal. Only on the way back to her hotel does van Beer tell her barrister and her solicitor what really happened, something she has been aware of all along. ==Characters in \\"Verdict of Twelve\\"The jury=== The ten men and two women who have been picked randomly to do jury service are: # an unmarried middle-aged journalist; # a young left-wing intellectual, newly married and happy; # a hard-working and honest publican; # a travelling salesman unsuccessfully trying to flog encyclopaedias; # a young attractive widow of Jewish descent whose husband was killed when he was attacked in the street by hooligans; # a young hairdresser sharing a house with three workmates; # an old, fat, homosexual university don specialising in the reconstruction of classical texts; # a young actor who has not quite found his personal style; # a restaurateur who successfully poses as an Englishman although he was born and raised a pauper in Greece; # a religious fanatic who believes he belongs to the chosen few; # a busy trade union official; # and, ironically, a murderess who has got away with her crime and who has been leading an inconspicuous and solitary life ever since. ==Major themes== Postgate's premise is that of Marx, that “it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but [that] on the contrary their social existence determines their consciousness”. Accordingly, he begins the novel by giving short biographies of each juror in which he describes their individual experiences, their social and financial background, the outlook on life which each of them has acquired over time, and also any possible predisposition to judge others harshly. Postgate presents all these factors to show that they prevent the jurors from considering evidence objectively, and that they will respond to the case emotionally rather than realistically. ==TV film adaptation== The American TV series Playhouse 90 (series 2, episode 31, 1958) featured a 90-minute version of the story under the name Verdict of Three, focussing on the three jurors who dominate the discussion. ==Read on== * Agatha Christie: Witness for the Prosecution (short story and play) * Cyril Hare: Tragedy at Law (novel) * Cameron McCabe: The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor (novel) * Reginald Rose: Twelve Angry Men (play) ==See also== * Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx for the idealism/materialism controversy * Legal drama ==External links== * 100 Years of Legal Fiction (a survey) * Saki’s short story “Sredni Vashtar” (e-text) * Category:1940 British novels Category:English novels Category:Crime novels Category:Novels by Raymond Postgate Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"Verdict of Twelve"},{"id":"2001079","text":"Lacus Odii (Latin odiī, \\"Lake of Hate\\") is a small lunar mare in the Terra Nivium region on the Moon.

He participated in the expedition to the central Russian province of Povolzhye, Siberia, Altay, and Transbaikal (1768–1774) organised by the Prussian scientist Peter Simon Pallas (1741–1811). In 1774, Falk took his own life in Kazan. Falk's notes were published in Germany as Beyträge zur topgraphischen Kentniß des rußischen Reichs (3 volumes, 1785–1786). They were edited by Johann Gottlieb Georgi (1729–1802). ==ReferencesLiterature== * Vera Shirokova, Alexey Sobisevich, Illustrations from Academic Expeditions in Russia: The works of Falck and Georgi iLINNAEUS | iMagazine | iStories (December 2015) Category:Swedish botanists Category:Swedish taxonomists Category:1732 births Category:1774 deaths Category:Imperial Russian botanists Category:Imperial Russian explorers Category:Age of Liberty people Category:Full Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences Category:Swedish nobility Category:Uppsala University alumni Category:18th-century botanists Category:18th-century Swedish scientists ","title":"Johan Peter Falk"},{"id":"2001086","text":"A self-authenticating document, under the law of evidence in the United States, is any document that can be admitted into evidence at a trial without proof being submitted to support the claim that the document is what it appears to be.

Preschool kindergarten education is compulsory and provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is also compulsory until age of sixteen. Primary education usually lasts for eight years. Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the secondary vocational schools for intermediate students lasts four years and the technical school prepares pupils for vocational education and the world of work. The system is partly flexible and bridges exist, graduates from a vocational school can achieve a two years program to have access to vocational higher education for instance. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in Hungary among the bests in the world for maths and science. Most of the Hungarian universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment. The general requirement for university is the Matura. The Hungarian public higher education system includes universities and other higher education institutes, that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. Health insurance for students is free until the end of their studies. English and German language is important in Hungarian higher education, there are a number of degree programs that are taught in these languages, which attracts thousands of exchange students every year. Hungary's higher education and training has been ranked 44 out of 148 countries in the Global competitiveness Report 2014. Today there are 67 higher education institutions in Hungary, ranging from small colleges to top research universities. These universities and colleges are maintained either by the state, private organizations or a church. In accordance with the objectives of the Bologna process the degree structure of tertiary education is based on three cycles. Nearly all study fields lead first to a Bachelor’s degree (usually 3 years), and after a further study period to a Master’s degree (2 years). However, there are some exceptions: medicine, pharmacy, dental and veterinary studies, architecture, law, teacher training, and certain arts-, crafts- and design-related study programmes, which retain a long single-cycle structure of 5 or 6 years of study. The first-cycle programmes last 6–8 semesters (3–4 years, 180–240 credit points) and lead to a bachelor's degree (in Hungarian: alapfokozat). The second cycle, leading to a master's degree (in Hungarian: mesterfokozat), lasts 2–4 semesters (1–2 years, 60–120 credit points). Two-year-long vocational higher education programmes (in Hungarian: felsőoktatási szakképzés) are also available on an optional basis prior to first-cycle programmes and lead to advanced vocational qualifications. The 120 credit points gained in vocational higher education programmes are compatible for recognition in the first (Bachelor) cycle. Any Bachelor’s or master's degree can be followed by specialised higher education courses (in Hungarian: szakirányú továbbképzés). These do not lead to another degree but offer the option of specialisation in a particular field of study. Courses can be studied full-time, part-time or through distance learning. A four-year doctoral programme is a post-graduate course to follow any Master’s or equivalent qualification. Hungary has a long tradition of higher education reflecting the existence of established knowledge economy. The established universities in Hungary include some of the oldest in the world, the first was the University of Pécs founded in 1367 which is still functioning, although in the year 1276, the university of Veszprém was destroyed by the troops of Peter Csák, but it was never rebuilt. Sigismund established Óbuda University in 1395. Another, Universitas Istropolitana, was established 1465 in Pozsony by Mattias Corvinus. Nagyszombat University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called Eötvös Loránd University today. The world's first institute of technology was founded in Selmecbánya, Kingdom of Hungary in 1735, its legal successor is the University of Miskolc. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure, its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II. ==The social environment of education== The decline of Hungary's population that started in 1981 has also continued in recent years. According to the 2001 census, the population of Hungary was 10,198,000, about half a million less than the figure of twenty years earlier. By 2005 the population dropped to 10,077,000. The age pyramid of the Hungarian population is among the most irregular ones in Europe. On 1 January 2005, due to the extremely low number of live births in the preceding years the size of the 0-4-year-old population was smaller than the next age groups of five-year increments up to the age group 60–64. There are major differences in the size of the various generations. The official language of instruction is Hungarian, but a number of ethnic and national minorities (e.g. German, Romanian, Slovene, Serb and Croatian) have minority educational institutions with their own languages as first or second language of instruction at primary and secondary level of teaching. According to the 2003 survey, the rate of Romani children in the population entering school education in 2008-2009 is expected to be around 15%.Medgyesi, M. (2007). The socio-economic environment of education. In Loboda, Z., Lannert, J. and Halász, G. (ed.) Education in Hungary 2006. Budapest: Hungarian Institute for Educational Research and Development. ==School system in Hungary== A special feature of the Hungarian education system is that institutional structures and the structure of educational programmes are not aligned with each other. The system's institutional structure and the presence of programmes allowing early selection show similarities with Central European and ex-socialist countries. The system's content structure, the uniform and general phase of education has extended, and secondary level education may be characterised by increased opportunities for transition. The general phase of education lasts until the age of 18 in Hungary's education system. Participation in secondary education, offering a wide variety of programmes, is fairly high. Within secondary education, the proportion of students studying in programmes leading to a secondary school- leaving certificate and offering transition to tertiary education is around the international average.Imre, A. and Györgyi, Z.

It caters for children from 3 to 7 years of age. Since 2015, participation in pre-primary education at this level (kindergarten) is compulsory from age 3 (before 2015 only the final year - beyond age 5 - was compulsory), although exceptions are made for developmental reasons Hungary lowers mandatory school age to three Public-sector institutions may only charge for services additional to their basic tasks, including for example extracurricular activities, meals, excursions, etc. Currently, the attendance rate with regard to the age groups 3–5, is just above 86%. The average duration of participation of children aged 3–7 in pre-primary education is just over 3 years (3.3), which is the highest average value in Europe.National summary sheets on education systems in Europe and ongoing reforms. (2006) Brussels: Eurydice. Hungarian pre-school class having outdoor activities, March 2007. In Hungary a kindergarten is called an óvoda ('place for caring'). Children attend kindergarten between the ages of 3–6/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons. Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign languages and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year children begin to be prepared to attend elementary school. Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma. ===Primary education=== Children start primary school when they reach school-maturity, usually in the year in which they have their 6th birthday (7th if they were born after May 31). Primary education can last for 4, 6 or 8 years. 8-year education is the most widespread; the other two options were introduced in the early 1990s. Subjects include literature, grammar, mathematics, music, art, Physical education, environmental studies (from 1st to 5th grade), biology (from 6th grade), geography (from 6th grade), history (from 5th grade), history of art, physics (from 6th grade), chemistry (from 7th grade), one or two foreign languages (usually English, German or French). Before 1990, Russian was compulsory. ===Secondary education=== Secondary education usually lasts for 4 years. In gimnáziums it can also last for 5, 6 or 8 years depending on how many years the student spent in primary school. Since 1997 the numbering of years in secondary school are following that of primary school (i. e. after the 8th grade of primary school the student goes to 9th grade, which is actually the 1st year of secondary school.) There are three kinds of high schools: * Gimnázium (grammar school; prepares students for higher education; teaches at least 2 foreign languages) * Szakgimnázium (secondary vocational school. It also provides a \\"secondary school leaving examination\\" opening higher education curriculum. ) * Szakközépiskola (vocational school. It also offers \\"bridge\\" programs to help low achieving students in primary school to catch up and join the usual vocational school curriculum) After finishing high school, students take a school-leaving exam (Matura or final exam, érettségi in Hungarian). From 2005 this consists of exams on five subjects: written exam in mathematics, verbal and written exams in Hungarian literature and grammar, a foreign language, history, and written and/or verbal exam in a subject of the student's choice. These exams also serve as an entry exam to universities and colleges. ====New secondary form until the school year of 2004/2005==== Many of the gimnáziums have begun to teach a foreign language intensively (usually 12-14 lessons a week) and IT (usually 3-4 lessons a week) in the first year. This is called nyelvi előkészítő évfolyam, literally \\"Language training class\\", or simply nulladik évfolyam (literally \\"0th grade\\"). After 2005, students will have less foreign language lessons and IT. At schools where there is no nulladik évfolyam (beginners classes), they may be required to introduce them because the majority of Hungarians do not speak more than one language, or only speak their parents' language or dialect. Most students will finish High School at the age of 18 or 19, or when they complete Year 13. Those who had at least an intermediate level language exam weren't required to pass a language exam at Matura, but has become compulsory since 2006. In language training classes, a student must pass an intermediate level language exam in the second year, and the same level Matura in the third year. ===Higher education=== Higher education in Hungary dates back to 1367 when Louis the Great founded the first Hungarian university in the city of Pécs. Higher education is divided between colleges and universities. College education generally lasts for 4 years, while university education lasts for 4 to 6 years depending on the course undertaken. Vocational curriculum usually last 2 years: they are opened to secondary vocational school's graduates, and eventually vocational school students (after 5 years of work in the desired field or after a two-year program leading to a \\"secondary school leaving certificate\\"). University PhD courses usually take 3 years to complete. Before students get their degree, they must pass an intermediate level language exam in the foreign language of their choice. English and German are the most popular. The number of Spanish- learners has been growing in the last few years. Recently a high number of students chose Esperanto and Romani languages. Both are said to have a relatively small vocabulary and easy grammar. ===Vocational schools === This school type (in Hungarian: szakiskola) typically provides general and pre- vocational education in grades 9 and 10, normally followed by three or two years of VET. At the end of their studies, students will acquire a qualification (ISCED 2C or mostly 3C). == Foreign students in Hungary == Hungary attracts foreign students from both EU and non-EU countries. Three quarters of the students arriving in Hungary arrive from just ten countries, while one quarter of the students arrives from another 100 countries. Among the countries sending most students are Germany, Iran, Norway, Israel and Sweden, while the majority of guest students are citizens of the neighbouring countries. In the 2008/2009 academic year, the total number of foreign students studying in Hungary was 16 916, while this number was only 14 491 in 2005/2006.Felvi.hu: An increasing number of foreign students each year The figures are increasing owing to the following advantages: * Hungary offers affordable tuition fees and living costs within the European Union and Schengen area; * A number of Nobel Prize Winners and scientific inventors were educated there; * There are easier admission procedures and fewer documents are needed for obtaining admission; * Hungary offers different types of scholarships for foreigners; * The cost of student accommodation in Hungary is lower than in most Western European Countries and Scandinavia.\\"Student accommodation costs in Budapest\\" * Many education programmes are offered in English and/or German; * Hungarian embassies issue education visas more easily than other European Union and Schengen Member States; * Residence permits issued in Hungary for foreign students allow them to travel to other Schengen countries without any further visa; * A number of low cost flights connect Hungarian cities to other countries and popular travel destinations; * There are employment opportunities in the European Union during education years and after graduation, etc.Study-hungary.com: Why study in Hungary? ===Preparatory courses=== Students interested in continuing their studies in Hungary will find preparatory courses in numerous universities from Debrecen to Budapest, from Budapest to Szeged, from Szeged to Pécs.Felvi.hu: University preparatory courses ==See also== * List of schools in Hungary * :Category:Schools in Hungary * Gymnasium * Matura * OKTV * Open access in Hungary to scholarly communication * School social work in Hungary ==ReferencesSources== * Number of enrolled students * About educational attainment (data from 2000) * About the educational budget (Hungarian only) ==External links== * Ministry of Education (in Hungarian and English) * Hungary's profile at EuroEducation.net * Hungarian Institute for Educational Research and Development (in Hungarian and English) * Education in Hungary 2006 * Hungarian Education (OSEAS) * The social and political history of Hungarian education * Hungary.hu - Education, culture * Information on education in Hungary, OECD - Contains indicators and information about Hungary and how it compares to other OECD and non-OECD countries * Diagram of Hungarian education system, OECD - Using 1997 ISCED classification of programmes and typical ages.

Located on the former U.S. Route 66, the ghost town sits on the Texas–New Mexico state line. It includes the Glenrio Historic District which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. The community was founded in 1903 as a railroad siding on the Rock Island Railroad. Its name is derived from Scots \\"glen\\" + Spanish \\"rio\\" (meaning \\"river\\"). ==History== Originally a railroad town, the village was renamed from Rock Island to Glenrio by the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1908 and began receiving motorists on the dusty Ozark Trail in 1917. Its original structures were adobe buildings. The circa-1910 Angel House was in New Mexico. The Ozark Trail was formed into U.S. Route 66 on November 11, 1926. By the 1930s, U.S. Route 66 in Texas was a paved two-lane road served locally by several filling stations, a restaurant, and a motel. The road was widened in the 1950s. A Texaco station (1950) and a diner (Brownlee Diner/Little Juarez Café, 1952) were constructed in Texas using the art moderne architectural style. The location of Glenrio on Texas and New Mexico's border led to some interesting business practices. At one point, all fuel was dispensed in Texas due to New Mexico's higher gasoline taxes. The 1930s State Line Bar and motel were built in New Mexico because Deaf Smith County, Texas, was dry at the time. The railroad station was in Texas. The local post office, built circa-1935, was in New Mexico. A water tank and windmill in New Mexico were constructed circa 1945. The Joseph Brownlee House, constructed in Amarillo in 1930, was moved to Glenrio in 1950. Glenrio was the site of the \\"First Motel in Texas\\" / \\"Last Motel in Texas\\" (Homer Ehresman's family-run 1953 State Line Café and Gas Station and 1955 Texas Longhorn Motel, closed in 1976) and other businesses which straddled the state line on U.S. Route 66 for many years until Interstate 40 bypassed the community in September 1973. Three filling stations (the 1925 Broyles Mobil station, a circa-1935 Texaco, and the 1946 Ferguson Gas Station) once operated in New Mexico. It went in to decline during 1975 when Interstate 40 had bypassed the town. For years there has been a simmering dispute over which state the east part of Glenrio is lawfully a part of: Texas or New Mexico? The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between too far west of that line, making the current towns of Farwell, Texline and the east part of Glenrio appear to be within the State of Texas. New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian. New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law. Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the land and towns (the east part of Glenrio) for all purposes are taxed and governed by the State of Texas. ==Location== Glenrio sits just a few yards to the south of Interstate 40 at Texas exit 0 on Business I-40, a road which turns into a local gravel road at the state line. This was the original Route 66 alignment between Glenrio and San Jon until 1952 and was paved for many years until Quay County removed the paving due to maintenance costs. Mail was formerly served by a post office on the New Mexico side of the town. The town consists of the remains of the courtyard motel and related Texas Longhorn Café and Phillips 66 service station, the post office, a few other buildings including the diner and adjacent Texaco service station, the old Route 66 roadbed, and the former roadbed of the Rock Island Railroad, whose tracks were removed in the 1980s. A few homes still exist in Glenrio; the Joseph Brownlee House and an office in the Texas Longhorn Motel were the last to be occupied. ===Glenrio Historic District=== Glenrio Historic District is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. At the time of the listing, the district included 12 contributing buildings and 4 other contributing structures. ===Glenrio Welcome Center=== On June 25, 2008, the State of New Mexico opened the Glenrio Welcome Center on Interstate 40 at the Texas state line. The center includes such things as a pet walk, a livestock corral, wireless Internet access, a movie theater, and information kiosks. Built to accommodate one million visitors per year, it includes green features such as recycling of greywater for grounds irrigation, and a wind turbine that will generate 20 percent of the center's energy. ==In cinema== Portions of The Grapes of Wrath (1940) were filmed in Glenrio. An abandoned \\"Glenn Rio Motel\\" is depicted in the town of Radiator Springs in 2006's animated film Cars, where the architectural design of Glenrio's Little Juarez Café is used for a vacant, abandoned building which eventually becomes the Racing Museum. The opening scene from the movie Daylight's End (2018) was filmed in Glenrio. ==Photo gallery== Image:Glenrio4 (1 of 1).jpg | Closed café and gas station in Glenrio Image:Glenrio1 (1 of 1).jpg | Closed hotel in Glenrio Image:Glenrio NM Tex Motel 1.jpg|First/Last Motel in Texas, Glenrio ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Quay County, New Mexico *National Register of Historic Places listings in Deaf Smith County, Texas ==ReferencesBibliography== * Fugate, Francis L. and Roberta B.

Her husbands included the Western Roman Emperors Valentinian III and Petronius Maximus. == Family == Eudoxia was born in 422, the daughter of Theodosius II, Eastern Roman Emperor and his consort Aelia Eudocia, a woman of Greek origin. Her only known siblings, Arcadius and Flacilla, predeceased their parents. Their paternal grandparents were Arcadius and Aelia Eudoxia. Their maternal grandfather was Leontius, a sophist from Athens. Solidus minted in Thessalonica to celebrate the marriage of Valentinian III to Licinia Eudoxia. The bride's father, Theodosius II, stands between them on the reverse. The identity of her maternal grandfather was first given by Socrates of Constantinople. John Malalas later gave a more detailed account of her mother's history. As summarised in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon, \\"The celebrated Athenais was educated by her father Leontius in the religion and sciences of the Greeks; and so advantageous was the opinion which the Athenian philosopher entertained of his contemporaries, that he divided his patrimony between his two sons, bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy of one hundred pieces of gold, in the lively confidence that her beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion. The jealousy and avarice of her brothers soon compelled Athenais to seek a refuge at Constantinople; and, with some hopes, either of justice or favor, to throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria. That sagacious princess listened to her eloquent complaint; and secretly destined the daughter of the philosopher Leontius to have as her husband the emperor of the East, who had now attained the twentieth year of his age. She easily excited the curiosity of her brother, by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais; large eyes, a well-proportioned nose, a fair complexion, golden locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanor, an understanding improved by study, and a virtue tried by distress. Theodosius, concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister, was permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the modest youth immediately declared his pure and honorable love; and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital and the provinces. Athenais, who was easily persuaded to renounce the errors of Paganism, received at her baptism the Christian name of Eudocia; but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of Augusta, till the wife of Theodosius had approved her fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen years afterwards, the Emperor of the West. The brothers of Eudocia obeyed, with some anxiety, her Imperial summons; but as she could easily forgive their unfortunate unkindness, she indulged the tenderness, or perhaps the vanity, of a sister, by promoting them to the rank of consuls and praefects.\\" Later historians have tended to reject the above account as too reminiscent of a fairy tale or a romance novel to be historically accurate. The exact circumstances of the introduction of Eudocia to Theodosius II and Pulcheria are considered unknown. The historical study Theodosian Empresses. Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity (1982) by Kenneth Holum, further introduced the suggestion that Leontius was a native of Antioch rather than Athens, drawing from the \\"traditional link\\" between the two cities and their philosophers. The argument is considered doubtful as the building activity of Eudocia in the 420s focused on Athens rather than Antioch.Geoffrey Greatrex, \\"Aelia Eudocia (Wife of Theodosius II)\\" The identity of Eudoxia's maternal grandmother is not recorded. == First marriage == In 424, Eudoxia was betrothed to Valentinian III, her first cousin, once removed. The year of their betrothal was recorded by Marcellinus Comes. At the time of their betrothal, Valentinian was approximately four years old, Eudoxia only two.Ralph W. Mathisen, \\"Valentinian III (425-455 A.D)\\" Gibbon attributes the betrothal to \\"the agreement of the three females who governed the Roman world\\", meaning Galla Placidia, her niece Pulcheria, and Pulcheria's sister- in-law Eudocia.Edward Gibbon, History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, chapter 33 Galla Placidia was Valentinian III's mother and a younger, paternal half-sister of Arcadius. Valentinian III was at the time being prepared to claim the throne of the Western Roman Empire, which was held by Joannes. The latter was not a member of the Theodosian dynasty and thus regarded a usurper by the Eastern court. Within 424, Valentinian was proclaimed a Caesar in the Eastern court. The following year, Joannes was defeated and executed. Valentinian replaced him as Augustus of the West. Eudoxia and Valentinian III married on 29 October 437, in Constantinople, their marriage marking the reunion of the two halves of the House of Theodosius. The marriage was recorded by Socrates of Constantinople, the Chronicon Paschale and Marcellinus Comes.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 2 In 439, Eudoxia was granted the title of Augusta, with the birth of their first daughter Eudocia. They also had a second daughter, Placidia.Ralph W. Mathisen, \\"Licinia Eudoxia\\" The births and eventual fates of the two daughters were recorded by Priscus, Procopius, John Malalas and the Chronicon Paschale. On 16 March 455, Valentinian III was killed in the Campus Martius, Rome by Optila and Thraustila. According to the fragmentary chronicle of John of Antioch, a 7th-century monk tentatively identified with John of the Sedre, Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch from 641 to 648Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"John of Antioch\\" \\"Maximus, failing in both his hopes, was bitterly angry. He summoned Optila and Thraustila, brave Scythians who had campaigned with Aëtius and had been assigned to attend on Valentinian, and talked to them. He gave and received guarantees, put the blame for Aëtius' murder on the Emperor, and urged that the better course would be to take revenge on them. Those who avenged the fallen man, he said, would justly have the greatest blessings. Not many days later, Valentinian rode in the Field of Ares with a few bodyguards and the followers of Optila and Thraustila. When he had dismounted from his horse and proceeded to archery, Optila and his friends attacked him. Optila struck Valentinian on his temple and when turned around to see the striker he dealt him a second blow on the face and felled him, and Thraustila slew Heraclius. Taking the Emperor's diadem and horse, they hastened to Maximus... \\"(John of Antioch fr.201.4-5: Gordon trans., pp. 52–53). Heraclius is identified as \\"a eunuch who had the greatest influence with the emperor\\" and his associate in murdering Aetius.Ralph W. Mathisen, Petronius Maximus (17 March 455 - 22 May 455) == Second marriage == Valentinian had no male descendants and had never designated an heir. Several candidates claimed the throne. Petronius Maximus, who was the highest-ranking of all Roman senators, was among them. A second candidate was Maximianus, son of Domninus. Domninus was a merchant from Egypt who had earned a considerable fortune. Maximianus had served as a domesticus, member of an elite guard unit of the late Roman Empire, under Aetius. Eudoxia promoted her own candidate, in the person of Majorian. John of Antioch reports that Maximus secured his own succession by buying the loyalties of palace officials and the local military. Eudoxia was forced to marry him or face execution. Their marriage secured the connection of Maximus to the Theodosian dynasty. Prosper of Aquitaine reports that Maximus befriended the murderers of Valentinian III instead of punishing them. Both Prosper and Victor of Tonnena place the marriage of Eudoxia to Maximus only days following the death of her first husband, commenting with disapproval that the empress was not given a period to grieve for Valentinian. John of Antioch mentions, but does not name, a previous wife of Maximus. She had reportedly been raped by Valentinian III, an event which the chronicle sees as the reason Maximus turned against his former master. The eventual fate of his first wife is not recorded. She may be presumed to have committed suicide, following the example of Lucretia.John Drinkwater and Hugh Elton, \\"Fifth-century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity?\\" (1992), page 119 Regardless, Maximus arranged the marriage of his son Palladius to his new stepdaughter Eudocia, the daughter of Eudoxia from her first marriage, again to secure a dynastic relation to the Theodosian dynasty. The historical study \\"Fifth- century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity?\\" (1992) by John Drinkwater and Hugh Elton considers it likely that the first wife of Maximus was also a sister to Avitus, his magister militum (Master of Soldiers). The writers have also suggested that Flavius Magnus was another son of Maximus from his first marriage, considering Flavius Probus to be a grandson. They also argue for placing the marriage of Placidia the Younger to Olybrius at this point, considering it to be the third marriage between a member of the Theodosian dynasty and a member of the extended Anicii family within the same year. They view Olybrius as a third son of Maximus, grandson through him of Anicius Probinus and grand-nephew of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius.John Drinkwater and Hugh Elton. \\"Fifth-century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity?\\" (1992). pages 117-120. However, considering the other possible filiation of Flavius Magnus given by Christian Settipani,Christian Settipani, Les Ancêtres de Charlemagne (France: Éditions Christian, 1989).Christian Settipani. Continuite Gentilice et Continuite Familiale Dans Les Familles Senatoriales Romaines A L'epoque Imperiale, Mythe et Realite, Addenda I - III (juillet 2000- octobre 2002) (n.p.: Prosopographica et Genealogica, 2002). as well as the lack of the name of Flavius Probus' mother, it can be assumed that he was a grandson of Petronius Maximus but from his mother. Maximus appointed Avitus as his Magister militum praesentalis (\\"Master of Soldiers in Attendance\\") and send him to Toulouse. There Avitus was to try to secure the loyalty of Theodoric II of the Visigoths to the new emperor. However his reign was to prove short. According to the chronicler Malchus, \\"Around this time, the empress Eudoxia, the widow of the emperor Valentinian and the daughter of the emperor Theodosius and Eudocia, remained unhappily at Rome and, enraged at the tyrant Maximus because of the murder of her spouse, she summoned the Vandal Gaiseric, king of Africa, against Maximus, who was ruling Rome. He came suddenly to Rome with his forces and captured the city, and having destroyed Maximus and all his forces, he took everything from the palace, even the bronze statues. He even led away as captives surviving senators, accompanied by their wives; along with them he also carried off to Carthage in Africa the empress Eudoxia, who had summoned him; her daughter Placidia, the wife of the patrician Olybrius, who then was staying at Constantinople; and even the maiden Eudocia. After he had returned, Gaiseric gave the younger Eudocia, a maiden, the daughter of the empress Eudoxia, to his son Huneric in marriage, and he held them both, the mother and the daughter, in great honor\\" (Chron. 366). Eudoxia was presumably following the example of her sister-in-law Justa Grata Honoria who had summoned Attila the Hun for help against an unwanted marriage. According to Prosper, Maximus was in Rome when the Vandals arrived. He gave anyone who could permission to flee the city. He attempted to flee himself but was assassinated by the imperial slaves. He had reigned for seventy-seven days. His body was thrown into the Tiber and never recovered. Victor of Tonnena agrees, adding the detail that Pope Leo I negotiated with Geiseric for the security of the city's population. Hydatius attributes the assassination to revolting troops of the Roman army, enraged at Maximus' attempted flight. The Chronica Gallica of 511 attributes the assassination to a rioting crowd. Jordanes identifies a single assassin as \\"Ursus, a Roman soldier\\". Ursus is Latin for \\"bear\\". Sidonius Apollinaris makes a cryptic comment regarding a Burgundian whose \\"traitorous leadership\\" led the crowd to panic and to the slaughter of the Emperor. His identity is unknown, persumably a general who failed to face the Vandals for one reason or the other. Later historians have suggested two high-ranking Burgundians as possible candidates, Gondioc and his brother Chilperic. Both joined Theodoric II in invading Hispania later in 455. ==Widow== The three women stayed prisoners in Carthage for seven years. In 462, Leo I, Eastern Roman Emperor paid a large ransom for Eudoxia and her daughter Placidia. Eudoxia returned to Constantinople after an absence of twenty-five years, Placidia joining her. Eudocia stayed in Africa and took Huneric as her husband. They were parents to Hilderic, king of the Vandals from 523 to 530. ==See also== *List of Byzantine emperors *List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses == References  External links == *A short article about Licinia by Ralph W.

It covers a large portion of the cities of Waterloo and Kitchener and the township of Wilmot, and some parts of the townships of Wellesley and North Dumfries. About 90% of the water supply of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo is derived from groundwater of the Waterloo Moraine aquifer system. During late 1989 and early 1990, groundwater contamination in Elmira forced the Region to shut down some well fields. As a result, new land use management guidelines and water protection measures have been enacted. The Waterloo Moraine is the largest of fourteen moraines in the Region, spanning approximately 400 square kilometres. It is an interlobate moraine, consisting primarily of sand and gravel. It contains large aquifers, which discharge into the Grand River and its tributaries and maintain a base water flow rate into that system. ==Origin== The Waterloo Moraine was formed as the three ice lobes of the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated across what is now Waterloo Region from Lake Huron in the west, Georgian Bay in the northeast, Lake Ontario in the east and Lake Erie in the southeast. As the glacier moved, it carried with it huge boulders, sand, gravel and debris. As the ice disappeared, the Waterloo Moraine remained, a huge complex of glacial sediments that is between 30 metres and more than 100 metres thick. Meltwater streams cascading from the surface of the ice lobes carried enormous deposits of sand and gravel and blocks of bedrock. The glacial sediments constituting the moraine rest upon the Guelph and Salina carbonate bedrock formations. ==Significance== The Waterloo Moraine provides drinking water for over 300,000 people throughout Waterloo Region, and approximately 75% of its potable water. The Waterloo Moraine is currently not protected by provincial legislation although there is an active movement from citizens to see that this takes place. Louisette Lanteigne and David Wellhauser of Waterloo have used the Environmental Bill of Rights to submit a Request for Review for a Waterloo Moraine Protection Act. This resulted in a 16-month review of source water and groundwater protection for the Waterloo Moraine. The findings will be published in September 2008. ==Function== In the vicinity where the three ice lobes began to retreat, sits the recharge areas that allow surface water to enter back into the ground source. The speed of absorption depends on the density of aquifers and aquitards. Aquifers are made up of sand, gravel and silt where the water filters down relatively quickly. The shallow aquifers feed area bodies of water such as creeks and streams while the deeper aquifers feed down to replenish the ground water. The aquitards are the protective layers of clay that slowly filters the water and act to protect the main source from contamination. Left on its own, it is a naturally renewable way to gather fresh drinking water. ===Ground water recharge=== The moraine covers much of the City of Waterloo, Kitchener, Wellesley, Wilmot and North Dumfries, covering of land. Almost half of the ground water recharge takes place on only 15% of the Grand River watershed and 80% occurs on only 30% of the land mass most of which is located at the west end of Waterloo Region in the townships of Wilmot and Wellesley. ==Threats== The ground water travels down from west to east feeding area wells throughout the region. Subdivision developments in the west end would create more impervious surfaces in the vicinity of the recharge area. Instead of allowing the water to refill the source, the run off will be diverted to sewage systems instead. This will mean a permanent decrease in the volume of water entering area wells. The reduction of water in the wells will significantly increase the parts per billion of contaminants in the system jeopardizing the quality of water in the aquifer and increasing the costs of filtration. If an increase in traffic follows the development in the vicinity of the aquifer, there will be an increased risk of contamination by road salt which is, according to Environment Canada, a known toxic substance. Road salt is a form of chloride that kills fish and pollutes area creeks and streams. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Professor Alan Morgan speaks of the History of the Waterloo Moraine * Road Salt Danger to the Waterloo Moraine * International Ground Water Expert Emil Frind Speaks out to protect the Waterloo Moraine * Grand River Conservation Authority's Water Forum Review 2004 Category:Moraines of Ontario Category:Landforms of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo ","title":"Waterloo Moraine"},{"id":"2001129","text":"The best evidence rule is a legal principle that holds an original of a document as superior evidence.

He arranged to send a team of volunteer doctors and an ambulance by collecting a fund of Rs 22,000 on the All-Indian China Day and China Fund days on 7–9 July. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose also wrote an article in Modern Review on Japan's role in the Far East and denounced the assault on China.\\"Japan's Role in the Far East\\" (originally published in the Modern Review in October 1937): \\"Japan has done great things for herself and for Asia. Her reawakening at the dawn of the present century sent a thrill throughout our Continent. Japan has shattered the white man's prestige in the Far East and has put all the Western imperialist powers on the defensive – not only in the military but also in the economic sphere. She is extremely sensitive – and rightly so – about her self- respect as an Asiatic race. She is determined to drive out the Western powers from the Far East. But could not all this have been achieved without Imperialism, without dismembering the Chinese Republic, without humiliating another proud, cultured and ancient race? No, with all our admiration for Japan, where such admiration is due, our whole heart goes out to China in her hour of trial\\" The Essential Writings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Sisir K. Bose and Sugata Bose (eds.). Delhi: Oxford University Press. 1997 p. 190. The key aspect of this mission was that it was a helping hand from a nation itself struggling for freedom, to another nation also struggling for its freedom. The mission was reinforced with Nehru's visit to China in 1939. Dwarkanath Kotnis, born in a middle class Maharashtrian family from Solapur on 10 October 1910, had then graduated from the Seth G S Medical College, Bombay and was preparing for post-graduation. He asked permission of his family to volunteer for service abroad. Dwarkanath's younger sister Manorama recalls that her brother wanted to travel around the world and practice medicine at different places. She said \\"most members of the family knew little about China at that time. We only knew that people used to come and sell Chinese silk,\\" While his father Shantaram encouraged young Dwarkanath to venture out, his mother was very sad because he was going that far and worse, in a war zone. A medical team of five doctors (Drs. M. Atal from Allahabad (who was also the leader of the mission), M. Cholkar from Nagpore, D. Kotnis from Sholapur, B.K. Basu and Debesh Mukherjee from Calcutta) was dispatched as the Indian Medical Mission Team in September 1938. All, except Dr. Kotnis, returned to India safely. The team first arrived in China at the port of Hankou, Wuhan. They were then sent to Yan'an, the revolutionary base at the time in 1939, where they were warmly welcomed by Mao Zedong, Zhu De and other top leaders of the Communist Party, as they were the first medical team to come from another Asian country. The 28-year-old Doctor came as a part of the five member team and stayed in China for almost 5 years working in mobile clinics to treat wounded soldiers. In 1939, Dr. Kotnis joined the Eighth Route Army (led by Mao Zedong) at the Jin- Cha-Ji border near the Wutai Mountain Area, after his efforts all across the northern China region. His job as a battlefront doctor was stressful, where there was always an acute shortage of medicines. In one long-drawn out battle against Japanese troops in 1940, Dr. Kotnis performed operations for up to 72 hours, without getting any sleep. He treated more than 800 wounded soldiers during the battle. He was eventually appointed as the Director of the Dr. Bethune International Peace Hospital named after the famous Canadian surgeon Norman Bethune. In 1940, Dr. Kotnis met Guo Qinglan, a nurse at the Bethune Hospital. They first met at the inauguration of Dr. Norman Bethune's tomb and Guo was immediately attracted to the Indian doctor. Kotnis could write and speak Chinese, which amazed her. The couple got married in December 1941. They had a son on 23 August 1942, who was named Yinhua – meaning India (Yin) and China (Hua), at the suggestion of Nie Rongzhen. Dr. Kotnis wrote letters to his family regularly. \\"He sounded very happy in the letters. People used to come to thank him for his help. He was telling the good part,\\" says Manorama. Every place he went in China, he described it in detail in his letters home. The whole family found them to be great fun because what he described was so different from the life in India. The hardship of the stressful job as a front-line doctor finally started to take its toll on him and severely affected his health. Only three months after the birth of Yinhua, epilepsy struck Dr.Kotnis. A series of epileptic seizures killed him on 9 December 1942, leaving behind his widow Guo Qinglan, and the baby son. Dr. Kotnis was buried in the Heroes Courtyard in Nanquan Village. At that time, Mao Zedong mourned his death by observing that \\"The army has lost a helping hand, the nation has lost a friend. Let us always bear in mind his internationalist spirit.\\" It is said that he joined the Communist Party of China on 7 July 1942, just before his death, but could not be verified. During his mission, he was also a lecturer at the Dr. Bethune Hygiene School of the Jinchaji (晉察冀) Military Command, and the first director of the Dr. Bethune International Peace Hospital, Yan'an. == Tribute == The tomb of Dwarkanath Kotnis in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. Upon his death in 1942, Mao Zedong mourned his death by observing that: Madame Sun Yat-sen said, concerning his role in the revolution, that \\"His memory belongs not only to your people and ours, but to the noble roll-call of fighters for the freedom and progress of all mankind. The future will honor him even more than the present, because it was for the future that he struggled.\\" The Martyr's Memorial park in Shijiazhuang city of the Northern Chinese province of Hebei is a famous attraction point. The north and south sides of the park are dedicated to the veterans of the Korean and the Japanese wars. The west side is dedicated to Dr. Norman Bethune, who fought for the Chinese, and the South side to Dr Kotnis. There is a great statue in his honour. A small museum there has a handbook of vocabulary that Kotnis wrote on his passage from India to China; some of the instruments that the surgeons used in their medical fight for life, and various photos of the doctors, some with the Communist Party of China's most influential figures, including Mao. == Memorial in Solapur, Maharashtra == Dr. Kotnis memorial at Solapur A memorial of Dwarkanath Shantaram Kotnis is installed in his birthplace in Solapur on 1 January 2012. The memorial, at his old residence, has been built by Solapur Municipal Corporation with efforts of Sushilkumar Shinde, who was Union Power Minister during the installation ceremony. Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan was present at the function. == Family == In November 1941, about a year before his death, Kotnis married Guo Qinglan, (, born 15 September 1916 in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province) a nurse at the Bethune International Peace Hospital. Kotnis and Guo had a son on 23 August 1942. At the suggestion of Nie Rongzhen they named the boy \\"Yinhua\\" combining the Chinese characters for \\"Yin\\" () for India and \\"Hua\\" () for China. Yinhua died aged 24 in 1967 shortly before he was to graduate from medical college.Sahay, Neha (16 November 2006) \\"The Legend Lives on\\". The Telegraph, Calcutta, India. His death has been attributed to medical negligence.\\"May Sino-Indian Friendship Develop From Generation to Generation\\". People's Daily. 2 June 2000. In 1949, Guo remarried to a Chinese man with whom she had a son and a daughter. Guo Qinglan has been an honoured guest at many high-level diplomatic functions between China and India, such as the banquet Dalian Mayor Bo Xilai hosted for then Indian President K.R. Narayanan in June 2000 and during the visit of then Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee to Beijing in June 2003. In November 2006, she accompanied Chinese President Hu Jintao on a state visit to India. She died on 28 June 2012 at the age of 96 in Dalian, in Northeastern China.\\"Hu Jintao's team has an Indian connection\\".

Her father, Frantisek Podesva, was a painter and her mother, Marie, was a writer. Her grandfather was a founder of the daily Czech newspaper Lidové noviny. In 1942, she attended the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague under Professor Rudolf Skopec, and later studied at the Academy of Visual Arts, from 1945 to 1950. She married fellow- artist Vladimír Fuka in 1950, and gave birth to her only child, Ivana, in 1951. In 1967 she defected with her family to the US. Her first husband died from diabetes in 1977. She married David H Engle in 1986. At the time of her death, Fuka was retired and split her time between New York City, Prague, Paris and the French Alps where she spent her summers. Fuka died on 25 November 2015 at the age of 88. == Photography == Fuka's artwork is characterized by surreal and melancholic effects, which she achieved by using her environment to create unreal settings with a dreamlike atmosphere. She ranks among the founding figures of Czech photography who introduced different approaches to the practice by taking advantage of her surroundings to attain particular effects between lights and shadows. Her work as a photographer started in 1939, when her father gifted her a Leica. Later on, in 1951, she and her husband became friends with dissident intellectuals Jiří Kolář, Jan Hanč, Kamil Lhoták, Jan Rychlík, Zdeněk Urbánek, and Josef Schwarz. In 1963 she published a monograph, an important step in her work as both photographer and woman artist, because photography was still struggling to be recognized in the world of art at the beginning of the sixties. A second monograph was published in 2007, by Torst, after Fuka had two big exhibitions, in 1996 and 2007. ==References== Category:1927 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Czech photographers Category:American women photographers Category:American people of Czech descent Category:Czechoslovak expatriates in the United States ","title":"Eva Fuka"},{"id":"2001230","text":"Lacus Hiemalis (Latin hiemālis, \\"Lake of Winter\\") is a small lunar mare in the Terra Nivium region on the Moon.

Heimalis ","title":"Lacus Hiemalis"},{"id":"2001231","text":"The law of evidence, also known as the rules of evidence, encompasses the rules and legal principles that govern the proof of facts in a legal proceeding. These rules determine what evidence must or must not be considered by the trier of fact in reaching its decision. The trier of fact is a judge in bench trials, or the jury in any cases involving a jury. The law of evidence is also concerned with the quantum (amount), quality, and type of proof needed to prevail in litigation. The rules vary depending upon whether the venue is a criminal court, civil court, or family court, and they vary by jurisdiction. The quantum of evidence is the amount of evidence needed; the quality of proof is how reliable such evidence should be considered. Important rules that govern admissibility concern hearsay, authentication, relevance, privilege, witnesses, opinions, expert testimony, identification and rules of physical evidence. There are various standards of evidence, standards showing how strong the evidence must be to meet the legal burden of proof in a given situation, ranging from reasonable suspicion to preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt. There are several types of evidence, depending on the form or source. Evidence governs the use of testimony (e.g., oral or written statements, such as an affidavit), exhibits (e.g., physical objects), documentary material, or demonstrative evidence, which are admissible (i.e., allowed to be considered by the trier of fact, such as jury) in a judicial or administrative proceeding (e.g., a court of law). When a dispute, whether relating to a civil or criminal matter, reaches the court there will always be a number of issues which one party will have to prove in order to persuade the court to find in his or her favour. The law must ensure certain guidelines are set out in order to ensure that evidence presented to the court can be regarded as trustworthy. ==History== The rules of evidence were developed over several centuries and are based upon the rules from Anglo-American common law brought to the New World by early settlers. The purpose is to be fair to both parties, disallowing the raising of allegations without a basis in provable fact. They are sometimes criticized as a legal technicality, but are an important part of the system for achieving a just result. Perhaps the most important of the rules of evidence is that, in general, hearsay testimony is inadmissible (although there are many exceptions to this rule). In England and Wales, the Civil Evidence Act 1995, section 1, specifically allows for admission of 'hearsay' evidence; legislation also allows for 'hearsay' evidence to be used in criminal proceedings, which makes it possible for the accuser to induce friends or family to give false evidence in support of their accusations because, normally, it would be rejected by the presiding authority or judge. There are several examples where presiding authorities are not bound by the rules of evidence. These include the military tribunals in the United States and tribunals used in Australia to try health professionals. ==Relevance and social policy== In every jurisdiction based on the English common law tradition, evidence must conform to a number of rules and restrictions to be admissible. Evidence must be relevantthat is, it must be directed at proving or disproving a legal element. However, the relevance of evidence is ordinarily a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition for the admissibility of evidence. For example, relevant evidence may be excluded if it is unfairly prejudicial, confusing, or the relevance or irrelevance of evidence cannot be determined by logical analysis. There is also general agreement that assessment of relevance or irrelevance involves or requires judgements about probabilities or uncertainties. Beyond that, there is little agreement. Many legal scholars and judges agree that ordinary reasoning, or common sense reasoning, plays an important role. There is less agreement about whether or not judgements of relevance or irrelevance are defensible only if the reasoning that supports such judgements is made fully explicit. However, most trial judges would reject any such requirement and would say that some judgements can and must rest partly on unarticulated and unarticulable hunches and intuitions. However, there is general (though implicit) agreement that the relevance of at least some types of expert evidenceparticularly evidence from the hard sciencesrequires particularly rigorous, or in any event more arcane reasoning than is usually needed or expected. There is a general agreement that judgments of relevance are largely within the discretion of the trial courtalthough relevance rulings that lead to the exclusion of evidence are more likely to be reversed on appeal than are relevance rulings that lead to the admission of evidence. According to Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), evidence is relevant if it has the \\"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\\" Federal Rule 403 allows relevant evidence to be excluded \\"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\\", if it leads to confusion of the issues, if it is misleading or if it is a waste of time. California Evidence Code section 352 also allows for exclusion to avoid \\"substantial danger of undue prejudice.\\" For example, evidence that the victim of a car accident was apparently a \\"liar, cheater, womanizer, and a man of low morals\\" was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant to whether he had a valid product liability claim against the manufacturer of the tires on his van (which had rolled over resulting in severe brain damage).Winfred D. v. Michelin North America, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1011 (2008) (reversing jury verdict for defendant). ==Presence or absence of a jury== The United States has a very complicated system of evidentiary rules; for example, John Wigmore's celebrated treatise on it filled ten volumes. James Bradley Thayer reported in 1898 that even English lawyers were surprised by the complexity of American evidence law, such as its reliance on exceptions to preserve evidentiary objections for appeal. Some legal experts, notably Stanford legal historian Lawrence Friedman, have argued that the complexity of American evidence law arises from two factors: (1) the right of American defendants to have findings of fact made by a jury in practically all criminal cases as well as many civil cases; and (2) the widespread consensus that tight limitations on the admissibility of evidence are necessary to prevent a jury of untrained laypersons from being swayed by irrelevant distractions. In Professor Friedman's words: \\"A trained judge would not need all these rules; and indeed, the law of evidence in systems that lack a jury is short, sweet, and clear.\\" However, Friedman's views are characteristic of an earlier generation of legal scholars. The majority of people now reject the formerly- popular proposition that the institution of trial by jury is the main reason for the existence of rules of evidence even in countries such as the United States and Australia; they argue that are at work.See, for example, Frederick Schauer, \\"On the Supposed Jury-Dependence of Evidence Law,\\" vol. 155 University of Pennsylvania Law Review pp. 165-202 (November 2006). See also 1 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law Section 4d.1 (P. Tillers. rev. 1983) and P. Tillers, \\"Rules of Evidence in Nonjury Trials\\" (Nov. 7 2006) at http://tillerstillers.blogspot.com/search?q=rules+jury ==Exclusion of evidenceUnfairness=== Under English law, evidence that would otherwise be admissible at trial may be excluded at the discretion of the trial judge if it would be unfair to the defendant to admit it. Evidence of a confession may be excluded because it was obtained by oppression or because the confession was made in consequence of anything said or done to the defendant that would be likely to make the confession unreliable. In these circumstances, it would be open to the trial judge to exclude the evidence of the confession under Section 78(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), or under Section 73 PACE, or under common law, although in practice the confession would be excluded under section 76 PACE. Other admissible evidence may be excluded, at the discretion of the trial judge under 78 PACE, or at common law, if the judge can be persuaded that having regard to all the circumstances including how the evidence was obtained \\"admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\\" In the United States and other countries, evidence may be excluded from a trial if it is the result of illegal activity by law enforcement, such as a search conducted without a warrant. Such illegal evidence is known as the fruit of the poisonous tree and is normally not permitted at trial. ==Authentication== Certain kinds of evidence, such as documentary evidence, are subject to the requirement that the offeror provide the trial judge with a certain amount of evidence (which need not be much and it need not be very strong) suggesting that the offered item of tangible evidence (e.g., a document, a gun) is what the offeror claims it is. This authentication requirement has import primarily in jury trials. If evidence of authenticity is lacking in a bench trial, the trial judge will simply dismiss the evidence as unpersuasive or irrelevant. Other kinds of evidence can be self-authenticating and require nothing to prove that the item is tangible evidence. Examples of self-authenticating evidence includes signed and certified public documents, newspapers, and acknowledged documents. ==Witnesses== In systems of proof based on the English common law tradition, almost all evidence must be sponsored by a witness, who has sworn or solemnly affirmed to tell the truth. The bulk of the law of evidence regulates the types of evidence that may be sought from witnesses and the manner in which the interrogation of witnesses is conducted such as during direct examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Other types of evidentiary rules specify the standards of persuasion (e.g., proof beyond a reasonable doubt) that a trier of fact—whether judge or jury—must apply when it assesses evidence. Today all persons are presumed to be qualified to serve as witnesses in trials and other legal proceedings, and all persons are also presumed to have a legal obligation to serve as witnesses if their testimony is sought. However, legal rules sometimes exempt people from the obligation to give evidence and legal rules disqualify people from serving as witnesses under some circumstances. Privilege rules give the holder of the privilege a right to prevent a witness from giving testimony. These privileges are ordinarily (but not always) designed to protect socially valued types of confidential communications. Some of the privileges that are often recognized in various U.S. jurisdictions are spousal privilege, attorney–client privilege, doctor–patient privilege, state secrets privilege, and clergy–penitent privilege. A variety of additional privileges are recognized in different jurisdictions, but the list of recognized privileges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; for example, some jurisdictions recognize a social worker–client privilege and other jurisdictions do not. Witness competence rules are legal rules that specify circumstances under which persons are ineligible to serve as witnesses. For example, neither a judge nor a juror is competent to testify in a trial in which the judge or the juror serves in that capacity; and in jurisdictions with a dead man statute, a person is deemed not competent to testify as to statements of or transactions with a deceased opposing party. Often, a Government or Parliamentary Act will govern the rules affecting the giving of evidence by witnesses in court. An example is the Evidence Act (NSW) 1995 which sets out the procedures for witnesses to follow in New South Wales, Australia.Evidence Act(NSW) 1995 http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/. ==Hearsay== Hearsay is one of the largest and most complex areas of the law of evidence in common-law jurisdictions. The default rule is that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Hearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. A party is offering a statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted if the party is trying to prove that the assertion made by the declarant (the maker of the out-of-trial statement) is true. For example, prior to trial Bob says, \\"Jane went to the store.\\" If the party offering this statement as evidence at trial is trying to prove that Jane actually went to the store, the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, at both common law and under evidence codifications such as the Federal Rules of Evidence, there are dozens of exemptions from and exceptions to the hearsay rule. ==Direct vs. circumstantial evidence== Direct evidence is any evidence that directly proves or disproves a fact. The most well-known type of direct evidence is a testimony from an eyewitness. In eye- witness testimonies the witness states exactly what they experienced, saw, or heard. Direct evidence may also be found in the form of documents. In cases that involve a breach of contract, the contract itself would be considered direct evidence as it can directly prove or disprove that there was breach of contract. Circumstantial evidence, however, is evidence that does not point directly to a fact and requires an inference in order to prove that fact. A common example of the distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence involves a person who comes into a building, when it may be raining. If the person declares, \\"It's raining outside\\", that statement is direct evidence that it is raining. If the person is carrying a wet umbrella, and he is wearing a wet rain coat, those observations are circumstantial evidence that it is raining outside. ==Burdens of proof== Different types of proceedings require parties to meet different burdens of proof, the typical examples being beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and convincing evidence, and preponderance of the evidence. Many jurisdictions have burden-shifting provisions, which require that if one party produces evidence tending to prove a certain point, the burden shifts to the other party to produce superior evidence tending to disprove it. One special category of information in this area includes things of which the court may take judicial notice. This category covers matters that are so well known that the court may deem them proved without the introduction of any evidence. For example, if a defendant is alleged to have illegally transported goods across a state line by driving them from Boston to Los Angeles, the court may take judicial notice of the fact that it is impossible to drive from Boston to Los Angeles without crossing a number of state lines. In a civil case, where the court takes judicial notice of the fact, that fact is deemed conclusively proved. In a criminal case, however, the defense may always submit evidence to rebut a point for which judicial notice has been taken. ==Evidentiary rules stemming from other areas of law== Some rules that affect the admissibility of evidence are nonetheless considered to belong to other areas of law. These include the exclusionary rule of criminal procedure, which prohibits the admission in a criminal trial of evidence gained by unconstitutional means, and the parol evidence rule of contract law, which prohibits the admission of extrinsic evidence of the contents of a written contract. ==Evidence as an area of study== In countries that follow the civil law system, evidence is normally studied as a branch of procedural law. All American law schools offer a course in evidence, and most require the subject either as a first year class, or as an upper-level class, or as a prerequisite to later courses. Furthermore, evidence is heavily tested on the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) - approximately one-sixth of the questions asked in that test will be in the area of evidence. The MBE predominantly tests evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence, giving little attention to matters on which the law of different states is likely to be inconsistent. ==Tampering, falsification, and spoliation== Acts that conceal, corrupt, or destroy evidence can be considered spoliation of evidence and/or tampering with evidence. Spoliation is usually the civil-law/due-process variant, may involve intent or negligence, may affect the outcome of a case in which the evidence is material, and may or may not result in criminal prosecution. Tampering is usually the criminal law variant in which a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys evidence to interfere with a law-enforcement, governmental, or regulatory investigation, and is usually defined as a crime. Parallel construction is the creation of an untruthful, but plausible, explanation for how the evidence came to be held, which hides its true origins, either to protect sources and methods used, or to avoid the evidence being excluded as unlawfully obtained.

In 1854 British engineer Charles Bright met an American, Cyrus Field, who had a dream of completing a submarine cable connection between North America and Europe. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company was founded in 1852 and in 1854 Charles Bright and John Watkins Brett became additional signatories along with Cyrus Field. This was to make sure that Britain had a representative on the company's board and so enable support for a trans-Atlantic cable from the British. In 1855 Charles Bright finished a survey of the Irish coast and came to the conclusion that Valentia Island, on the south coast of Ireland, was best possible location and was also the closest point to North America. Armed with this location and the information that Cyrus Field gathered from a US Navy oceanographic seabed survey, that had taken place the year before, the project got underway. ==External links== *'Historical Notes' *'1854 Charter of the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company' Category:Peter Cooper Category:Telegraph companies Category:Defunct companies of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company"},{"id":"2001242","text":"American bison The Buffalo Commons is a conceptual proposal to create a vast nature preserve by returning of the drier portion of the Great Plains to native prairie, and by reintroducing the American bison (\\"buffalo\\"), that once grazed the shortgrass prairie. The proposal would affect ten states: Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas. ==History== The proposal originated with Frank J. Popper and Deborah Popper, who argued in a 1987 essayDeborah Epstein Popper and Frank J. Popper, \\"Great Plains: From Dust to Dust\\" , Planning, December 1987 (on- line text, Planning Magazine). that the current use of the drier parts of the plains is not sustainable. The authors viewed the historic European-American settlement of the Plains States as hampered by lack of understanding of the ecology and an example of the \\"Tragedy of the Commons\\". Many people in potentially affected states resisted the concept during the 1990s. ==Cause== The Poppers note that periodic disasters such as the Dust Bowl and continuing significant population loss over the last 80 years show the area is not sustainable for large-scale farming. They note that the rural Plains has lost a third of its population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles of the Great Plains have fewer than 6 persons per square mile. This was the population density standard of settlement which historian Frederick Jackson Turner used in his \\"Frontier Thesis\\" to declare the American Frontier \\"closed\\" in 1893. Large areas have fewer than 2 persons per square mile. The Poppers demonstrated that the number of \\"frontier counties\\" increased by 14 between 1980 and 2000, mostly on the Plains, and noted that there are more than 6,000 ghost towns in the state of Kansas alone (according to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald). They claim that the decline in population on the plains is accelerating. ==Details== 2000 U.S. population density in persons per sq. mile: yellow 1-4, light green, 5-9 The Poppers propose that a significant portion of the region be gradually shifted from farming and ranching use. They envision an area of native grassland, of perhaps 10 or 20 million acres (40,000 or 80,000 km²) in size. One way to achieve this would be through voluntary contracts between the Forest Service and Plains farmers and ranchers, in which owners would be paid the value of what they would have cultivated over the next 15 years. In the meantime, they would be required to plant and reestablish native Shortgrass prairie grasses and forbs, according to a Forest Service-approved program. At the end of the period, the Forest Service would purchase their holdings, while granting owners a homestead. Since their initial article in 1987, the Poppers have acknowledged that many other parties have very important roles to play. They do not see the federal government as central as they first did. ==Outcomes== High Plains grazing land in Morgan County, Colorado The proposal attracted some public attention, particularly since several Plains states and Native Americans on their reservations had already started reintroduction of bison. Many Plains residents intensely criticized the concept, especially in the first years. They point out that much of rural flight is due to mechanization of agriculture, wherefore fewer people are needed to produce the same amount (or more) of agriculture output, not because farms are failing. Proponents answer that the criticism is based on a misunderstood assumption that the plan would be coercive rather than voluntary. Given the pace of rural depopulation, many scholars believe that aspects of the proposal are likely to happen with or without national government involvement. States, non-profit community development groups, and Native American nations have found the concept supports some of their own ideas about the future. Some are working independently or partnering on related ecological and sustainability issues. In the last decade, as the Poppers talk about the concept, they acknowledge there are many players. They have seen many partnerships come about, including private and non-governmental initiatives. The Poppers draw parallels between the Plains and Northern New England, which had agricultural depopulation following the opening of transportation to the West in the 1830s. In New England, the dominant forests have returned, taking over former areas of agricultural cultivation which were abandoned. North Dakota's 2000 economic roadmap noted the Buffalo Commons idea was \\"vilified\\", but had elements that could be of use to the state. The report suggested the concept could increase revenues from tourism. This was just one among many economic development avenues suggested in the report. The only population that has increased on the plains is that of various Native American nations. Some of these have started to raise bison, in part for tourism and ecological value, as well as its primary place in their traditional cultures. In 1992 Native American tribes started the InterTribal Bison Cooperative. The consortium now includes 57 Native American governments in 19 states. It trains Indian buffalo producers and tribal land managers, and takes other steps to reinvigorate buffalo's historically central place in their cultures. The buffalo count on Indian land has at least tripled since 1992. As of 2009, the tribes collectively managed 15,000 bison.\\"About Us\\", Intertribal Bison Collective, 2009, accessed 12 October 2009 Non-profits and private owners have also been raising bison; by 2001, the number of bison on the Plains had increased to a total of 300,000. As of 2009, the high plains population continued to decline, local economies continued to shrink, and the region's major water resource, the Ogallala Aquifer, had shrunk more quickly than had been expected. Public perceptions of the concept of the Buffalo Commons have begun to change. In November 2009 The Kansas City Star published an editorial that claimed the aquifer was almost depleted and noted the biggest asset of the high plains was its prairie. It supported the creation of a million-acre (4,000 km²) Buffalo Commons National Park in western Kansas.The Kansas City Star: A new park to save the plains, November 15, 2009, Section B, page 7 The editorial suggested such a park could satisfy several goals: * attract tourists who would stimulate the economies of nearby towns; * provide carbon sequestration by the prairies; and * protect America's natural and cultural heritage. == See also == *American Prairie Reserve *Depopulation of the Great Plains ==ReferencesExternal linksFurther reading=== * * \\"Buffalo Commons\\", Great Plains Restoration Council * * * American Prairie Reserve === Popular articles === * \\"Plains sense\\", High Country News on the recent history of the proposal * Matt Moline, \\"Land Use Ideas Resurface\\", The Capital-Journal, 2 Feb 2004 Category:Great Plains .

In 1994, Ty Murray broke Mahan's and Ferguson's record of six titles and tied Ferguson's record of having won six titles consecutively. In 1998, Murray won his seventh title, surpassing both of them and holding the record for all-around titles at seven titles. In 2010, Trevor Brazile won his eighth all-around title, surpassing them all. In 2018, Brazile won his 14th all-around title. In his first year as a professional rodeo cowboy, Ferguson came in second in the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in the All-Around Cowboy event. He accumulated more than $1 million in his rodeo career and was among the first rodeo cowboys to hire a manager. In 1974, he won the World Tie-Down Roping championship and came second in the Steer Wrestling event. In 1976 he won the World Steer Wrestling Championship.

He retired from football in 2019, after three seasons with Celtic. ==Club careerNetherlands=== De Vries began his professional career at Telstar, making his first team debut during the 1999–2000 season. He remained with the club in the second tier of Dutch football until 2003, when he signed for Eredivisie side ADO Den Haag. After mostly serving as back-up to Roland Jansen, he took over as number one during the 2004–05 campaign. However, this status proved short lived as the loan capture of Jaroslav Drobný during 2006 pushed De Vries aside, and he was told that he would not be offered a new contract. ===Dunfermline Athletic=== In the summer of 2006, following a successful trial, he signed a contract with Scottish Premier League club Dunfermline Athletic. He made his debut in a 0–0 draw with Ayr United in the second round of the Scottish League Cup, saving a penalty to take the match to extra time before going on to win in a penalty shoot-out. On 11 May 2007, he palmed a tame free kick into his own net against Inverness Caledonian Thistle to end Dunfermline's seven-year stay in the Scottish Premier League. However, following the match, Dunfermline manager Stephen Kenny refused to blame De Vries for his team's relegation, stating: \\"We can attach absolutely no blame to him because he has been out of this world this season. His final match for the club came in the 2007 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Celtic. ===Swansea City=== After becoming a free agent at the end of his contract, De Vries signed a two-year deal at Swansea City on 6 July 2007. In his first season with the Welsh side he helped the club to the League One title, as the club's first choice goalkeeper. In the 2009–10 season, De Vries surpassed Roger Freestone's club record of 22 clean sheets in a single season with a shut-out against Scunthorpe United on 5 April 2010. He would go on to finish the season with 25 clean sheets, winning the Football League's Golden Glove award for the Championship in the process. The following season, he was part of the team that won the Championship Play-off Final, against Reading, to reach the Premier League. Initially, De Vries stated that he wanted to stay with the club for their first Premier League season. However, he rejected their contract offer shortly after and was subsequently signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers. ===Wolverhampton Wanderers=== On 22 June 2011, it was confirmed that free agent De Vries had joined Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers, signing a three-year contract. At Wolves, De Vries primarily served as back-up to Wayne Hennessey and initially only gained playing time in cup competitions. He made his club debut on 23 August 2011 in a 4–0 League Cup win at Northampton Town. When first choice goalkeeper Hennessey suffered a torn cruciate knee ligament in April 2012, De Vries made his first-ever Premier League appearance. However, by this stage Wolves had become rooted in the relegation zone and the 0–2 defeat against eventual champions Manchester City on De Vries' league debut confirmed their relegation back to the Championship. De Vries remained in the Wolves' goal for their remaining fixtures, including a trip to his former club Swansea, before which he said that he has no regrets about his decision to leave Swansea and join Wolves; he received mixed reception from Swansea fans and went on to concede four times in a 4–4 draw. Following relegation, De Vries was a target for Liverpool following their appointment of former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers as manager, but their bid of a reported £500,000 was not accepted. With the new season beginning with Wayne Hennessey still sidelined through injury, new Wolves manager Ståle Solbakken opted to instead start with Carl Ikeme in goal. His only start under Solbakken came in a League Cup loss at Chelsea, during which the goalkeeper conceded six times. In late October Solbakken admitted that he and De Vries had had an angry confrontation regarding his lack of opportunities. For a second consecutive season his chance to play league football only arrived through injury, when Ikeme suffered a self-inflicted broken hand in March 2013. He played in all of Wolves' remaining fixtures as the team again struggled unsuccessfully to avoid relegation under another manager, Dean Saunders. Following relegation to League One, Saunders was fired and replaced by Kenny Jackett, who has stated that De Vries was free to leave on a free transfer as he sought to slim down the squad. ===Nottingham Forest=== On 3 July 2013, De Vries signed a two-year deal with Championship club Nottingham Forest. Upon joining the club, De Vries stated the move wouldn't be easy for him over a first choice goalkeeper. De Vries was given the number 29 shirt. In his first season at Nottingham Forest, De Vries was primarily second choice goalkeeper behind Karl Darlow throughout the season, making his debut for the club on 21 April 2014 in a 2–1 win over Leeds United, and remained in goal for the remainder of the season with Darlow injured. De Vries was again second choice in 2014–2015, eventually displacing Darlow for a spell including the 2–1 derby win over Derby County, but Darlow was re-instated by Dougie Freedman, immediately on replacing Stuart Pearce as manager. Following Darlow's move to Newcastle United, De Vries was promoted to first-choice goalkeeper for the 2015–16 season and took the number one shirt. He played in all but one of Forest's league matches, missing the away fixture against Sheffield Wednesday with a back injury. On 1 May 2016 De Vries was voted Player of the Season for 2015–16 by Forest's supporters after a consistent year in goal, which included a hat-trick of Player of the Month awards for August, February and March. De Vries made one appearance for Forest in the 2016–17 season: on opening day in a 4–3 victory over Burton Albion.. He suffered a knee injury and was replaced by new signing Stephen Henderson ===Celtic=== On 13 August 2016, De Vries signed a two-year deal with Celtic. He made his debut on 27 August, playing the full match in Celtic's 4–1 win over Aberdeen at Celtic Park. He played in his first Old Firm match on 10 September, in only his second appearance, as Celtic beat Rangers 5–1. Three days later he made his European debut, in a 7–0 defeat to Barcelona at Camp Nou in the UEFA Champions League. After playing the full ninety minutes of the 2–2 draw away at Inverness Caledonian Thistle, de Vries was substituted at half-time against Kilmarnock on 24 September, replaced by Craig Gordon; this was his last appearance of the 2016–17 season. De Vries made only one appearance in the entire 2017 calendar year: a 1–0 win over Dundee on 14 October. De Vries replaced Gordon at half-time shortly after the latter suffered a knee injury in the 1–0 win over Hibernian on 27 January 2018. This gave De Vries an extended run in the side, taking in Scottish Premiership clashes with Aberdeen, Hearts, Kilmarnock, and St Johnstone, Scottish Cup victories over first Partick Thistle and then Greenock Morton, and De Vries' UEFA Europa League début, which came against Zenit Saint Petersburg. Celtic exited the Europa League after a 3–1 aggregate defeat to Zenit; the Russians' second goal, described by De Vries as a \\"knuckleball\\", deceived him, and it is his belief that his side never recovered from that concession. De Vries was injured in training on 9 March and replaced by Scott Bain in the match with Rangers two days later, and made no further appearances in the 2017–18 season, finishing with 10 appearances: two in the Scottish Cup, two in the Europa League, and six in the League. De Vries left Celtic at the end of the 2018-19 season, and then announced his retirement from football. ==Career statistics== De Vries making his UEFA Europa League debut, playing for Celtic against Zenit Saint Petersburg in 2018 {| class=\\"wikitable\\"  |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=4 |ADO Den Haag |2003–04 |Eredivisie |18||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||colspan=2|–||18||0 |- |2004–05 |Eredivisie |31||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||colspan=2|–||32||0 |- |2005–06 |Eredivisie |20||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||colspan=2|—||20||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !69!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=2|—!!colspan=2|—!!70!!0 |- |Dunfermline Athletic |2006–07 |Scottish Premier League |27||0||5||0||2||0||colspan=2|-||34||0 |- |rowspan=5 |Swansea City |2007–08 |League One |46||0||4||0||2||0||6||0||58||0 |- |2008–09 |Championship |40||0||3||0||3||0||colspan=2|-||46||0 |- |2009–10 |Championship |46||0||1||0||1||0||colspan=2|-||48||0 |- |2010–11 |Championship |46||0||0||0||2||0||3||0||51||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !178!!0!!8!!0!!8||0!!9||0!!203!!0 |- |rowspan=3|Wolverhampton Wanderers |2011–12 |Premier League |4||0||2||0||3||0||colspan=2|-||9||0 |- |2012–13 |Championship |10||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=2|-||11||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !14!!0!!2!!0!!4!!0!!colspan=2|—!!20!!0 |- |rowspan=5|Nottingham Forest |2013–14 |Championship |3||0||2||0||3||0||colspan=2|—||8||0 |- |2014–15 |Championship |4||0||1||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||6||0 |- |2015–16 |Championship |45||0||2||0||1||0||colspan=2|—||48||0 |- |2016–17 |Championship |1||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !53!!0!!5!!0!!5!!0!!colspan=2|—!!63!!0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !337!!0!!21!!0!!18!!0!!9!!0!!386!!0 |} ==HonoursClub=== Swansea City *Football League Championship play-offs: 2010–11 *Football League One: 2007–08 Celtic *Scottish Premiership : 2016–17 *Scottish League Cup : 2016–17, 2017–18 *Scottish Cup : 2016–17, 2018–19 ===Individual=== *Championship Golden Glove: 2009–10 *Nottingham Forest Player of the Year: 2016 ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from Beverwijk Category:Dutch footballers Category:Netherlands under-21 international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:SC Telstar players Category:ADO Den Haag players Category:Dunfermline Athletic F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Celtic F.C. players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Dutch expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Wales Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland ","title":"Dorus de Vries"},{"id":"2001286","text":"The Ticket may refer to: *The Ticket, a supplement to The Irish Times *\\"The Ticket\\" (Seinfeld), a 1992 episode of Seinfeld *\\"The Ticket\\" (The West Wing), a 2005 episode of The West Wing *SportsRadio 1310/96.7 The Ticket, an AM/FM sports-talk radio station in Dallas, Texas, broadcast on KTCK-AM/KTCK-FM *KTLT, an FM radio station in Anson, Texas, branded as The Ticket *WAXY (AM), an AM sports-talk radio station in Miami-Ft.

Its current titleholder is Trevor Murdoch, who is in his first reign. The championship was established in January 1980 as the top singles title of Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), a prominent NWA-affiliated promotion. Until its September 1986 deactivation, the title remained Georgia-based -- across 3 different owners (GCW; Championship Wrestling from Georgia, and Jim Crockett Promotions). The title was reactivated in May 1997 and promoted by a handful of NWA-affiliated independent promotions, until its was vacated in October 2017. In October 2018, the title was renamed the \\"NWA National Championship\\", reactivated, and the NWA (now a promotion, instead of a sanctioning body) held an 8-person tournament to crown a new titleholder. ==Title history== The NWA National Heavyweight Championship was the top singles title in the NWA- affiliated promotion, Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), from 1980 until 1986. Contrary to its name, the title was defended almost exclusively in just one state, Georgia. When World Wrestling Entertainment (then called, the World Wrestling Federation) purchased GCW (Black Saturday (1984)) in July 1984, then-champion The Spoiler signed with the WWF (which even, briefly, recognized the title). Soon thereafter, Championship Wrestling from Georgia -- started by former GCW booker Ole Anderson -- launched and gained NWA affiliation. The title was awarded to Ted DiBiase. In 1985, Jim Crockett Promotions purchased the weekend TBS timeslots for wrestling from the WWF, producing its own version of the \\"World Championship Wrestling\\" TV show. JCP had also purchased Championship Wrestling from Georgia (taking over its Saturday morning time slot, as well), and began recognizing CWG's championships. Eventually, Crockett held a unification match between his company's NWA United States Champion Nikita Koloff, and NWA National Champion Wahoo McDaniel, which Koloff won. The National title was deactivated, after that. In May 1997, the title was reactivated and promoted by various NWA-affiliated, independent promotions across the United States. In October 2017, Billy Corgan's company Lightning One, Inc., purchased the National Wrestling Alliance's intellectual and physical properties. At that point, all pre-existing NWA affiliation agreements with other promotions were ended; most NWA-branded championships (including the National) would be vacated in the months that immediately followed. The only two championships not vacated were the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship, and NWA World Women's Championship. Corgan transformed the NWA from a governing body, to a wrestling promotion -- one seeking to proudly revive and preserve the mood, look, and feel of the 1970s/1980s, Georgia/Mid-Atlantic era of wrestling. In October 2018, the NWA announced the National title would be rebooted on the NWA 70th Anniversary Show, with an eight-man, championship tournament featuring: Jay Bradley; Colt Cabana; Sammy Guevara; Mike Parrow; Scorpio Sky; Sam Shaw; Ricky Starks; and Willie Mack. The championship was officially renamed the \\"NWA National Championship\\". A new title belt was commissioned: its design was a faithful restoration of the 1970s, Crockett/Mid-Atlantic Wrestling version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship belt, with a few modern tweaks. ==List of NWA National Champions== Current NWA National Champion Trevor Murdoch The NWA currently recognizes 85 individual National Championship reigns. The inaugural champion was Austin Idol. The longest reigning champion is Phil Shatter, who held the title from January 17, 2009 to February 19, 2011 for a total of 763 days. Ricky Murdock holds the record for longest combined reigns (2) at 817 days. Killer Tim Brooks has the shortest reign. Damien Wayne, Phil \\"Nitro\\" Monahan, Greg Anthony, Lou Marconi, Paul Orndorff, Tommy Rich, Larry Zbyszko, and Masked Superstar have the most reigns with 3 apiece. Trevor Murdoch is the current champion in his first reign. He won the title on September 29, 2020 during the UWN Primtime Live pay-per-view in Long Beach, California by defeating Aron Stevens. === Names === {|class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !Name !Years |- |NWA National Heavyweight Championship |January 12, 1980 – October 21, 2018 |- |NWA National Championship |October 21, 2018 – present |} === Reigns === As of , . == Combined reigns == As of , . {|class=\\"wikitable\\" !style=\\"background-color:#ffe6bd\\"|† |Indicates the current champion |- !style=\\"background-color:#bbeeff\\"|¤ |The exact length of at least one title reign is uncertain, so the shortest possible length is used. |} {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\" !Rank !Wrestler !No. of reigns !Combined days |- !1 | || 2 || 817 |- !2 | || 1 || 763 |- !3 | || 2 || 596 |- !4 | || 2 || 564 |- !5 ||| 2 || 469 |- !6 | || 1 || 455 |- !7 | || 1 || 358 |- !8 | || 2 || style=\\"background-color:#bbeeff\\"|291¤ |- !9 | || 1 || 290 |- !10 | || 3 || 279 |- !11 | || 2 || 270 |- !12 | || 3 || 267 |- !13 | || 3 || 245 |- !14 | || 3 || 243 |- !15 | || 1 || 233 |- !16 | || 1 || 221 |- !17 | || 1 || 217 |- !18 | || 2 || 204 |- !19 | || 1 || 188 |- !20 | || 3 || |187 |- !21 | || 1 || 182 |- !22 | || 2 || 181 |- !23 | || 1 || 181 |- !24 | || 1 || 177 |- !25 | || 1 || 175 |- !26 | || 1 || 139 |- !27 | || 2 || 137 |- !28 | || 3 || 128 |- !29 | || 3 || 125 |- !30 | || 3 || 118 |- !rowspan=2|31 | || 1 || 113 |- | || 1 || 113 |- !rowspan=2|33 | || 2 || 112 |- | || 1 || 112 |- !35 | || 1 || 94 |- !36 | || 1 || 85 |- !37 | || 1 || 75 |- !38 | || 1 || 69 |- !39 | || 1 || 67 |- !40 | || 1 || 63 |- !41 | || 1 || 62 |- !42 | || 1 || 58 |- !43 | || 1 || 54 |- !44 | || 1 || 52 |- !rowspan=2|45 | || 1 || 49 |- | || 1 || 49 |- !47 | || 1 || 42 |- !rowspan=3|48 | || 1 || 35 |- | || 2 || 35 |- | || 1 || 35 |- !51 | || 1 || 31 |- !52 | || 1 || 28 |- !rowspan=2|53 | || 1 || 21 |- | || 1 || 21 |- !55 |style=\\"background-color:#ffe6bd\\"| † || 1 || + |- !56 | || 1 || 7 |- !57 | || 1 || 4 |- !rowspan=2|58 | || 1 || <1 |- | || 1 || <1 |} ==See also== *List of National Wrestling Alliance championships *List of current champions in the National Wrestling Alliance ==References External links == * Official NWA website * Official NWA YouTube channel * Official NWA Facebook page Category:Georgia Championship Wrestling championships Category:Jim Crockett Promotions championships Category:National Wrestling Alliance championships Category:Heavyweight wrestling championships Category:National professional wrestling championships ","title":"NWA National Heavyweight Championship"},{"id":"2001310","text":"New Hampshire Route 4 (NH 4) is a state highway located in eastern Strafford County, New Hampshire. Its western terminus is at an intersection with New Hampshire Route 9 and New Hampshire Route 108 in Dover. Its northern terminus is at the Maine state border in Rollinsford, where it continues as Maine State Route 4. For most of its length NH 4 is signed as an east-west highway. Signage in downtown Dover while overlapped with NH 9 and NH 108 is inconsistent as it is sometimes signed north-south. In general, NH 4 follows a southwest-to-northeast alignment. NH 4 is not related to U.S. Route 4, which also enters the Dover city limits. They are the only non-linked highways to share a number in New Hampshire and remain under NHDOT maintenance. (Maine State Route 113 does cross into New Hampshire near NH 113, but remains completely under MaineDOT maintenance.) ==Route descriptionWestern terminus=== The western terminus of NH 4 is not readily apparent, but signage suggests it to be at the intersection of Central Avenue and Silver Street (where NH 9 and NH 108 split). Signage at the intersection of Silver Street and Central Avenue seems to indicate NH 4 continuing westbound along NH 9; however, no further signage for NH 4 exists west of this point. ===Downtown Dover=== From the intersection of Central Avenue and Silver Street, NH 4 is overlapped with NH 9 and NH 108 for , until NH 4 splits off in the center of town. The exact routing differs depending on which direction one is traveling, due to the one-way streets it traverses in the downtown area. In the eastbound direction, NH 4 is overlapped with NH 9 east / NH 108 north onto Main Street then splits off onto Portland Avenue, on which it remains. However, in the westbound direction NH 4 (as signed) splits from Portland Avenue onto Chapel Street. It then turns right onto Saint John Street, left onto Broadway, then left onto Central Avenue (NH 9 west / NH 108 south). Westbound Portland Avenue from Chapel Street to Main Street is signed as a truck route. To continue to the main route, traffic must turn right onto Main Street then make a left-hand U-turn to loop around onto Central Avenue. ===Rollinsford=== After leaving downtown Dover, NH 4 crosses into the town of Rollinsford. It is the only state route to pass through Rollinsford and runs in the south-central part of town for about . NH 4 then crosses the Salmon Falls River into the town of South Berwick, Maine, and becomes Maine State Route 4 (which is signed as a north-south highway). NH 4 is named Portland Avenue in Rollinsford. ==History== 60x60px NH 4 (and State Route 4 in Maine by extension) was originally intended to be a part of US 4, hence its number. However, US 4 was ultimately routed from Durham to the southern tip of Dover and along the Spaulding Turnpike to Portsmouth. While US 4 never entered Maine, the number 4 was retained for the resulting state highway in Maine. For continuity's sake, New Hampshire kept the number 4 on its section of the highway as well. US 4 only travels through a small section of southern Dover (mostly along the Spaulding Turnpike) which is several miles from downtown, meaning it was unlikely that the two highways would be easily confused. ==Major intersections Concurrent routes == * New Hampshire Route 9 / New Hampshire Route 108: , Dover ==Suffixed routesNew Hampshire Route 4A=== 60x60px This route between Lebanon and Andover is an alternate route of US 4 and is not associated with NH 4. ==ReferencesExternal links== * New Hampshire State Route 4 on Flickr 004 Category:Transportation in Strafford County, New Hampshire Category:Dover, New Hampshire ","title":"New Hampshire Route 4"},{"id":"2001318","text":"Glenn Peter Strömberg (; born 5 January 1960) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Of the 160 carriages ordered, 40 were diverted as an additional 10 four-car Class 450 units, and the remaining 120 were modified as 30 four-car Class 350/1 units. The top speed of the fleet was originally , but all 350/1s were modified to allow running from December 2012, in order to make better use of paths on the busy West Coast Main Line. A second batch of Class 350/2 units, intended to replace the units, was delivered in late 2008 and during 2009. The first of the Class 350/2 was launched on 8 October 2008, and carried invited guests around the Wildenrath Test Track.\\"Siemens hands over first 'Desiro' EMU\\" . Railway Herald. Issue 151. Page 4. 13 October 2008. Retrieved 19 July 2011. The last of the Class 350/2 fleet (350 267) was officially delivered to London Midland on 30 July 2009. Class 350/2 differ from the Class 350/1 units in two key aspects: they have 3+2 seating in standard class (because they work short-hop commuter services, the Class 350/1 are 2+2 throughout, work longer distance services) and lack the dual-voltage capability of the 350/1. Initially, Class 350/2 units had a maximum speed of , but the fleet was upgraded to allow 110 mph running during 2018. This was to allow the operators to run mixed 350/1 and 350/2 services without causing delays, especially important given the capacity changes which HS2 works at London Euston were expected to cause. Class 350 trains are nearly identical to those of Class 450. The latter class is only fitted with traction equipment for Southern Region 750 V DC third rail, whilst the Class 350/1 units can operate from either OLE, as is done in regular service, or alternatively third rail. This dual-voltage capability was utilised when several units were leased to Southern in 2008 and 2009, in order to cover for similarly equipped Class 377/2 units temporarily sub-leased to First Capital Connect, themselves to cover for delays in the construction of the 377/5 fleet.Desiros for Loan to Southern - Southern Electric Group. Retrieved 6 June 2013. All Class 350 units built since are not equipped for third-rail use but, like most modern British EMUs, can be retrofitted if necessary. Every set of doors has its own set of guard-operated door controls behind a lockable panel. The cabs have three radio systems - Cab Secure Radio (CSR), National Radio Network (NRN) and the newest system, GSM-R. CCTV and dot-matrix destination screens are fitted throughout the train. ==Operation West Midlands Trains === All of London Midland's 77 Class 350s were then inherited by West Midlands Trains from London Midland on 9 December 2017. WMT operate all of the units under their London Northwestern Railway brand. A further 10 units were transferred from TransPennine Express between 2019 and 2020. The fleet is based at the purpose-built Kings Heath depot at Kingsthorpe, Northampton, which opened in June 2006 and can also service Class 319 and other Desiro units if required. ==Former operations Central Trains / Silverlink === The first Class 350 units entered service in June 2005 with Central Trains. These operated on services between Birmingham and Northampton via Coventry, and all Birmingham - Liverpool services, replacing units. Most recently Desiros have taken over some peak services between Birmingham and Walsall. Silverlink began operating in July 2005 between London Euston - Milton Keynes Central and Northampton.\\"Silverlink launches the 'Class 350'\\" . Railway Herald. Issue 15. Page 3. 15 July 2005. Retrieved 19 July 2011. The Central Trains and Silverlink franchises expired in 2007. === London Midland === Once the Central Trains & Silverlink franchises expired, the entire fleet transferred to London Midland, the holder of the then new West Midlands franchise. As part of the agreement, London Midland embarked on the acquisition of a significant number of new trains, the largest order of which was for 37 additional Class 350 units. The first ten 350/2 units entered service in December 2008. In addition to the existing operations, these units took over the new Crewe - London Euston service running via Stoke-on-Trent and stopping at most of the Trent Valley Line stations. Four 350/1 units were subleased to Southern from 2008 to 2009, to provide cover for Class 377 units subleased to First Capital Connect. After newer Class 377 Electrostar trains were built, these units were returned to London Midland.Desiros for Loan to Southern - Southern Electric Group. Retrieved 29 April 2014. Ten additional four-car units were built for the London Midland franchise, to provide additional capacity, entering service from October 2014. ===TransPennine Express=== Ten additional four-car units were introduced in 2013 for First TransPennine Express to coincide with the completion of the electrification of the eastern section of the Manchester to Liverpool via Newton-le-Willows line.New Rolling Stock for London Midland and for First TransPennine Express - London Midland. 14 September 2011. Retrieved 17 September 2011.Rail Passengers in the North of England and Scotland to benefit from new trains - First TransPennine Express. Retrieved 16 March 2012. These units were used on services between Manchester and Edinburgh / Glasgow, while the displaced Class 185s have remained with TransPennine to enhance capacity on other routes. The new trains have a revised specification allowing running with an intercity- style interior described as similar to the existing 185s. The first First TransPennine Express Class 350/4 services ran on 30 December 2013 between Manchester Piccadilly and Glasgow Central.\\"Electric trains boost\\" . Wigan Today. 3 January 2014. The trains operated from Manchester Airport and Preston to Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley. All ten trains were delivered to TransPennine Express allowing most services on the Manchester to Scotland route to be operated using EMUs. The TransPennine Express units were based at Siemens' existing Ardwick depot, with the government providing funding for the required electrification. TransPennine Express had 12 Class 397 Civity units on order to replace the Class 350/4s on TransPennine North West services, with the Class 350/4s moving to West Midlands Trains. The first unit transferred in Summer 2019 and by 5th April 2020, all 10 units had transferred. ==Future== West Midlands Trains announced that they would be replacing the Class 350/2 units with brand new Class 730 \\"Aventra\\" units.

The leading carriage of 350233 was severely damaged, and all four carriages were damaged along one side. The consequences were not as serious as they could potentially have been because the derailed train was fortuitously kept from diverging too far from its line by equipment on the bottom of the train catching on the rail, meaning 350233 struck only a glancing blow. On 10 November 2016, unit 350264 was moved to Germany by low- loader, followed later by 350233.

In 2009 it voted to dissolve itself and merge with the National Union of Students. NPC was formed by affiliation from student representative bodies across the United Kingdom and seeks, in the words of its constitution, \\"to advance, in the public interest, the education of postgraduate students within the United Kingdom\\" through representation, lobbying, contribution to public policy debate, initiating communication between relevant parties and bringing key issues and potential solutions to wider audiences. The organisation's motion to dissolve and engage in merger talks with NUS cited several reasons for the organisation's winding up, including \\"the increased capacity of the NUS with regards to that organisation's ability to meet the needs of postgraduates, and that likelihood that this capacity will increase.\\" Other organisations cited additional reasons which led to NPC's dissolution, including financial and management difficulties. ==History== The NPC was formed in the 1980s as a network of officers. In 1990, recognising that at that time the National Union of Students (NUS) was not well set up to represent the particular issues postgraduate faced nationally it held its first conference at the University of Cambridge; Chris Whitty was elected chair. Following this a growth in activity ensued, leading to the adoption of formal structures. It adopted its first constitution in 1992, the same year that it created the full-time post of General Secretary and began its affiliation scheme. The NPC sought charitable status for a number of years and obtained this in 2002, following the passing of a new constitution.

Income was derived from affiliation fees by several student representative bodies in the United Kingdom along with a small number of donations.

The Philippine Trench (also Philippine Deep, Mindanao Trench, and Mindanao Deep) is a submarine trench to the east of the Philippines. The trench is located in the Philippine sea of the western North Pacific Ocean and continues NNW-SSE. It has a length of approximately and a width of about from the center of the Philippine island of Luzon trending southeast to the northern Maluku island of Halmahera in Indonesia. At its deepest point, the trench reaches 10,540 meters (34,580 ft) or (5,760 fathoms). The Philippine Trench in the east which continues downward, and the Philippine Mobile Belt. Immediately to the north of the Philippine Trench is the East Luzon Trench. They are separated, with their continuity interrupted and displaced, by Benham Plateau on the Philippine Sea Plate. == Information == The Philippine trench is hypothesized to be younger than 8–9 million years ago. The central part of the Philippine fault formed during the Plio-Pleistocene times is considered to be an active depression of the Earth's crust. The trench formed from a collision between the Palawan and Zamboanga plates. This caused a change in geological processes going from a convergent zone to a subduction zone. The subduction zone is located west to east of the Philippine Islands. The rate of subduction on these plates is estimated to be about 15 cm per year. A convergent zone borders an estimate of 45% of the Philippine Trench today. Although there are vast areas of subduction zones, some authors have considered this region to have low seismic activity, though the USGS has recorded many earthquakes with magnitude ≥ 7.2 in the region as shown by the map to the side. Most recently, in 2012 the Philippine Trench experienced an earthquake of Mw 7.6 (the 2012 Samar earthquake). It hit the trench with a hypocenter depth of 34.9 km. Areas adjacent to the subduction zones have experienced large seismic activity. In 1897, northern Samar experienced a Ms 7.3 earthquake while in 1924 southern Mindanao experienced one with a Ms 8.2. == Depth == The trench reaches one of the greatest depths in the ocean, third only to the Mariana trench and the Tonga trench. Its deepest point is known as Galathea Depth and reaches 10,540 meters (34,580 ft) or (5,760 fathoms). == Sedimentation == Sedimentation of the Philippine trench contains slightly metamorphosed, calc-alkalic, basic, ultrabasic rock and sand grains. The southern area of the trench contains homogenous, blue, clay silt and was poor in lime. Sand grains that were also found contained fresh basaltic andesite. The sediments found in the trenches are hypothesized to have been deposited by turbidity currents.

This prohibition applies only against a witness who has an interest in the outcome of the case and applies only where that witness is testifying for his own interests and against the interests of the decedent. Furthermore, the restriction only exists in civil cases, never in criminal cases. The restriction can be waived. A waiver can occur in a number of ways: #The decedent's representative fails to object to the testimony; #The decedent's own representative testifies to the communication; #The decedent's testimony is brought before the jury in the form of a deposition or in another form.

Founded in 1883 as the Burgh of Govan Police Pipe Band, the band enjoyed its greatest competitive success as the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band. ==History== Burgh of Govan Police Pipe Band The band was one of the first civilian bands in Britain when it formed in 1883 as the Burgh of Govan Police Pipe Band. The first pipe major was William Bremer, who was succeeded by Walter Drysdale in 1890, who was in turn succeeded by Alexander Hutcheon in 1898. The band enjoyed a good reputation, and was recognised nationally for its quality. It wore a tartan designed by the Chief Constable, and played two concerts annually to raise funds. Govan was annexed into Glasgow along with Partick in 1912, and the band became the City of Glasgow Police Pipe Band. In 1913 William Gray, a Gold Medal winner, replaced Hutcheon as pipe major, and the tartan was also replaced with the Royal Stewart. The band won its first World Championship in 1920, but due to Gray's focus on events other than competition the next time the band won the Worlds was 1936. Gray was succeeded in 1932 by John MacDonald, a student of Gray for many years and also a Gold Medal winner, having won at both the Argyllshire Gathering and the Northern Meeting within a week. Under MacDonald, the band won the World Championships in 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939, and after the Second World War in 1946, 1949 and 1951. Angus MacDonald succeeded John MacDonald in 1958, and rebuilt the band after the loss of senior players through retirement had reduced the band's competitiveness. Under Angus MacDonald the band won every major championship except the Worlds. Ronald Lawrie succeeded Angus MacDonald as pipe major in 1967, but due to ill health Lawrie was succeeded by Ian MacLellan in 1972. In 1975, Strathclyde Police was formed by the merger of several police forces to form the second-largest police force in Britain, and the respective bands were merged into the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band under the leadership of Ian MacLellan. Under MacLellan and leading drummer Alex Connell the band won the World Championships in 1976 and 1979, being placed second to Dysart and Dundonald in 1977 and 1978. Strathclyde Police then won every year from 1981 to 1986, and then four consecutive times from 1988 to 1991. In 1987, the 78th Fraser Highlanders Pipe Band from Canada became the first band based outside Scotland to win the title, and Simon Fraser University, also from Canada, came second, pushing Strathclyde Police into third place. The run of six consecutive wins remains a record, as does the twenty total wins accumulated throughout the band's history. MacLellan retired in 1992 and was succeeded by Harry McAleer, who led the band until 1996 when he was succeeded by Ian Plunkett. Plunkett was succeeded by James Wark in 2001, who was in turn succeeded by Donald Mackay in 2004, and Don Bradford became pipe major in 2008 after Mackay stood down. In 2009, funding cuts and a restriction on the number of events the band could play at threatened the future of the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band. Bradford and pipe-sergeant Duncan Nicholson resigned in protest, but returned in January 2010 after a new funding agreement was reached. Duncan Nicholson succeeded Bradford in as pipe major in 2010. In 2013, territorial police forces in Scotland were merged into Police Scotland and the name of the band changed to Greater Glasgow Police Scotland Pipe Band, but the structure of the band was unchanged. In 2016, David Henderson replaced Ward as leading drummer, and the name of the band was changed to Glasgow Police Pipe Band. In December 2019, Pipe Major Ian McPherson stepped down as Pipe Major and Alisdair McLaren was then appointed. McLaren stepped down in January 2020 due to unforeseen family matters. Following McLaren's resignation, Duncan Nicholson, former pipe major, was appointed. Glasgow Police Pipe Band later announced on Facebook that Ewan Henderson would be appointed Pipe Major with immediate effect as he succeeds Duncan Nicholson who stepped in as interim Pipe Major. ==Pipe Majors== *William Bremer (1883-1890) *Walter Drysdale (1890-1898) *Alexander Hutcheon (1898-1913) *William Gray (1913-1932) *John MacDonald (1932-1958) *Angus MacDonald (1958-1966) *Ronald Lawrie (1966-1972) *Ian MacLellan (1972-1992) *Harry McAleer (1992-1997) *Ian Plunkett (1997-2001) *James Wark (2001-2004) *Donald Mackay (2004-2008) *Don Bradford (2008-2010) *Duncan Nicholson (2010-2015) *Iain MacPherson (2015-2019) *Alistair McLaren (2019-2020) *Duncan Nicholson (2020-2020) *Ewan Henderson (2020–present) ==Leading Drummers== *D/M Walker (1883 - approx. 1910) *John Seton (approx. 1910-1927) *Jack Seton (1927-1948) *Alex McCormick (1948-1952) *John Walley (1954-1961) *Alex Connell (1961-1985) *John Kirkwood Jr. (1985-1992) *Roddy Darroch (1992-1995) *Eric Ward (1995-2016) *David Henderson (2016–present) ==Discography== as City of Glasgow Police Pipe Band *Selection of Strathspeys and Reels/Eightsome Reels - P/M J.

It requires ratifying states to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and to raise progressively the minimum age for admission to employment or work. Convention C138 replaces several similar ILO conventions in specific fields of labour. ==Minimum ages== Countries are free to specify a minimum age for labour, with a minimum of 15 years. A declaration of 14 years is also possible when for a specified period of time. Laws may also permit light work for children aged 13–15 (not harming their health or school work). The minimum age of 18 years is specified for work which \\"is likely to jeopardise the health, safety or morals of young persons\\". Definitions of the type of work and derogations are only possible after tripartite consultations (if such a system exists in the ratifying country). == Effect on other conventions == The convention is a revision of several conventions for workers in specific areas. Upon entry into force, some of these conventions were closed for ratification and becoming a party to this convention automatically resulted in denunciation of the older ones. An overview of older minimum age conventions of ILO is shown below: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- ! ILO code !! Field !! conclusion date !! entry into force !! closure for signature !!

As of June 2020 173 countries have signed Convention C138. Initially, however, the pace of ratification of this convention was extremely slow. Therefore, an alternative Convention with a more limited scope was initiated in 1999. p. 74 referring to 1999 ILO Convention C182: Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour), 2133 United Nations Treaty Series, p. 163 It concerns ILO Convention 182 concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. Convention C138 enters into force for a ratifying country one year after ratification. This can be denounced every 10 years in the year after 10 years have passed (e.g. – ). {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"width: 35em; text- align: left;\\" |+The following countries have ratified this convention: |- !

Social conflict occurs when two or more actors oppose each other in social interaction, each exerts social power with reciprocity in an effort to achieve incompatible goals whilst preventing the other from attaining their own. It is a social relationship wherein action is intentionally oriented to carry out the actor's own will despite the resistance of others.Pruitt, Dean G., Kim, Sung Hee, Eds., (2004, 3rd Edition) Social Conflict, Escalation and Settlement, McGraw Hill Higher Education, New York, NY ( ==Conflict Theory== Conflict theory emphasizes interests, rather than norms and values, in conflict. The pursuit of interests generates various types of conflict. Thus conflict is seen as a normal aspect of social life rather than an abnormal occurrence. Competition over resources is often the cause of conflict. The three tenets of this theory are the following: 1) Society is composed of different groups that compete for resources. 2) While societies may portray a sense of cooperation, a continual power struggle exists between social groups as they pursue their own interests. Within societies, certain groups control specific resources and means of production. 3) Social groups will use resources to their own advantage in the pursuit of their goals. This often means that those who lack control over resources will be taken advantage of. As a result, many dominated groups will struggle with other groups in an attempt to gain control. The majority of the time, the groups with the most resources will gain or maintain power (due to the fact that they have the resources to support their power). The idea that those who have control will maintain control is known as The Matthew Effect. One branch of conflict theory is critical criminology. This term is based upon the view that the fundamental cause of crime is oppression, resulting from social and economic forces operating within a given society. This perspective stems from German philosopher, Karl Marx, who knew the justice system and laws was in favour of the rich and powerful in a society and that the poor are punished far more severely for much smaller crimes. Another branch of conflict theory is the conflict theory of aging. This came about in the 1980s due to a setback in federal spending and a loss of jobs across the nation; the older generations competed with the younger generation for employment. Among those that were the worst affected were women, low-income families, and minorities. ==Karl Marx== In the Critique of the Political Economy Marx writes: In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At some stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters (legcuffs). Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure. In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic – in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production. No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient to have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society. Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient,[A] feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production – antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence – but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique- pol-economy/preface.htm Karl Marx, a German revolutionary, emphasized his materialist views on ownership and means of production. He argued that what is most valued is a result of human labour and founded his ideas based on a capitalistic community, meaning a majority of the money is owned by only a small percentage. This causes a distinction between two classes, the industrialists and the working class. The industrialists, the ones that make up the small percentage, own the means of production. The working class are those earning their wages by selling their labour. Problems become noticeable because the upper class is looking to get the most production possible for the least amount of money. Surplus value is created; the profit industrialists hold on to caused by workers producing more than the employers actually need to repay the cost of hiring labourers. Another occurrence is exploitation; when workers receive less money than what their labour is worth. Marx believed that the gap between industrialists and the labourers would continue to grow. The industrialists would become more and more wealthy, and the labourers continue to move towards poverty. Conflict theory is seen throughout relationships and interactions between two groups of people including races, opposite sexes, and religions. Max Weber and Karl Marx have two different approaches to the conflict theory. Marx supports the ideas of deviance, claiming that individuals choose to engage in such rebellious and conflicting behaviour as a response to the inequalities of the capitalist system. Weber discusses the conflict of stratification and its effects on power in society. He stresses property, prestige, and power as the main influences to the conflicting behaviours of groups in society. Karl Marx argued: \\"The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and range. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion to the devaluation of the world of men. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity -- and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally.\\" A commodity is a social use value produced by its owner not for personal consumption but for exchange. Marx believed that an entrepreneur has more and more to keep up with the more his company and power expands. It becomes more difficult each time his range of power increases. Eventually, the entrepreneur himself will become a commodity because he/she will no longer be able to keep up with their business and will have to put themselves (their company) up for sale on the market. ==Stratification== Stratification is the distribution of a valued good in levels or could be seen as the inequalities among individuals and groups. Weber determined that there are three levels of stratification and those include: property (economic class), prestige (status), and power (party). Property is related to control and ownership; prestige is the position that gains value determined by interactions with others; power is influence, relations, and position. ==Systems of stratification== These systems share 3 characteristics. They are as follows: # The rankings apply to social categories of people who share a common characteristic without necessarily interacting or identifying with each other. # People's life experiences and opportunities depend on the ranking of their social category. # The ranks of different social categories change very slowly over time. ==Conflict interests== Conflict of interest is a type of conflict interest. We can define a conflict of interest as a situation in which a person has a private or personal interest sufficient to appear to influence the objective exercise of his or her official duties as, say, a public official, an employee, or a professional. \\"Social conflict is not limited to hostile or antagonistic opposition; it is not wholly a clash of coercive powers as often is implied but of any opposing social powers. Social conflict is usually recognized through violence and physical behaviour. Yet it's more than just fighting, and killing one another. At times it can deal with it throw a simple town in a conversation. It is acknowledged by someone's power.\\" Lewis A. Coser, a sociologist, disagrees with the majority of American sociologists who, he contends, have badly neglected and misunderstood the concept and function of social conflict. He defines social conflict as '… a struggle over the values and claims to scarce status, power and resources in which the aims of the opponents are to neutralize, injure, or eliminate their rivals'. He believes that the prevalent tendency is to look upon conflict as dysfunctional and pathological.

Its western terminus is at the Vermont state line in Charlestown, where it continues west as Vermont Route 11. The eastern terminus is at the Maine state line in Rochester, where it crosses the border with U.S. Route 202 and continues as Maine State Route 11. Its number is derived from its original 1925 designation as New England Interstate Route 11. The highway follows a generally southwest to northeast alignment from the Vermont state line until reaching Lake Winnipesaukee, then turns southeast for the remainder of its routing to the Maine state line. There are 4 auxiliary routes, labeled 11A through 11D. ==Route descriptionCharlestown to Newport=== NH 11 begins on the western bank of the Connecticut River, where VT 11 crosses from Springfield, Vermont, into Charlestown, New Hampshire, just feet from its intersection with US 5. Just north of the town center, the highway meets and joins NH 12 north towards Claremont. NH 11 and NH 12 are cosigned for . NH 12A, a western bypass of downtown Claremont, splits off just south of the city line. In downtown Claremont NH 11 leaves NH 12 and NH 103 joins eastbound, starting a longer concurrency. The two highways cross the Sugar River and meet the southern terminus of NH 120 before continuing east towards Newport. In downtown Newport, NH 11 and 103 briefly join NH 10 before turning east again to leave town. The two routes continue east for another before NH 103 splits off to the southeast. ===Sunapee to Franklin=== NH 11 in East Andover, NH NH 11 continues east into Sunapee until reaching the town center, where it meets NH 103B, a connector to the Mount Sunapee Resort. NH 11 turns northward along the western side of Lake Sunapee and rounds the northern end of the lake at Georges Mills, turning back to the east. NH 11 enters the town of New London, meets the northern terminus of NH 103A (which runs along the east side of the lake) and immediately turns onto Interstate 89 south (at exit 12). NH 11 runs along I-89 for before departing at exit 11. After leaving I-89, NH 11 continues east, crossing NH 114 before entering the town of Wilmot.

In the center of Tilton, the road intersects with NH 132 just feet north of the Northfield town line. NH 132 joins US 3 and NH 11 as the road turns northeast, continuing to parallel the Winnipesaukee River's west side. The highway interchanges with Interstate 93 near the western terminus of NH 140, then NH 132 splits off to the north. Continuing northeast, US 3 and NH 11 cross Winnisquam Lake and skirt the northern tip of Belmont. Just before reaching the city line with Laconia, US 3 and NH 11 split off onto the Gilford-Laconia Bypass, a freeway bypass of those two towns (the historic surface alignment continues into downtown as NH 11A and unsigned US 3 Business). The freeway bypasses downtown Laconia to the south, interchanging with NH 106 and NH 107 before crossing into Gilford, where the road turns due north and interchanges with NH 11A. The freeway ends to the north, near Laconia Airport, and NH 11 splits off from US 3 after a concurrency. ===Gilford to Rochester=== After splitting from US 3, NH 11 intersects with two of its \\"child\\" routes, NH 11C and NH 11B, as it heads towards Lake Winnipesaukee.

Originally founded in 1921 in Seattle as Simpson Bible Institute, the institution relocated to San Francisco in 1955 and then to Redding in 1989. ==History== Simpson University, named after Albert Benjamin Simpson, a pioneer of the Bible institute movement and founder of The Christian and Missionary Alliance denomination, was established in 1921. Created by W.W. Newberry with the intent of promoting spiritual growth and Christian service in its students, the school initially only offered two-year programs. By 1945 it had expanded its offering and also became the official western regional school of The Christian and Missionary Alliance. By 1971 the university was large enough to offer in-depth liberal arts programs, professional degrees, and biblical courses. Another historic milestone was reached in 1989 when Simpson relocated to its current location in Redding and began building a new campus. In 2004, Simpson College became Simpson University. ==Academics== Simpson offers many degrees at both the undergraduate and graduate level. In additional to its School of Traditional Undergraduate Studies, it is also home to the Betty M. Dean School of Nursing, which is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education and ranked No. 8 in California Nursing Schools in 2019; the School of Education; School of Adult Studies (ASPIRE degree-completion program); School of Graduate Professional Studies; and A.W. Tozer Theological Seminary. ==AthleticsMascot=== Originally, while still located in San Francisco, the school's athletes were the Knights. After the school moved to Redding, there was a conflict with nearby Shasta College, who were also the Knights. Simpson remained the Knights for the first year in Redding, and in 1990 adopted Vanguard as its mascot. In the fall of 2004, Simpson again changed its mascot to a Red Hawk. ===Sports=== Simpson University teams, nicknamed the Red Hawks, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the California Pacific Conference (CalPac), with some teams competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC).

The song originated with his signature comedy routine \\"heyeah (here) come da judge\\", which made a mockery of formal courtroom etiquette.

The Moskva-Volga Canal was constructed between 1932 and 1937 on which Khimki lies on the west bank. Khimki was then officially founded in 1939.Город Химки, Московская область ===Khimki in the Battle of Moscow=== The German attack starting the Battle of Moscow (code-named ‘Operation Typhoon’) began on 2 October 1941. The attack on a broad front brought German forces to occupy the village of Krasnaya Polyana (now in the town of Lobnya) to Moscow's North West. Krasnaya Polyana was taken on 30 November.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olYUrlIfWg0 43 mins 45 secs into this \\"The World at War2 Episode 5\\" Many sources state that at least one German army patrol visited Khimki. Similarly many sources state this as the closest point the Germans reached to Moscow (Khimki at the time was from the edge of Moscow). Among the sources stating the Germans visited Khimki the details of the date and unit involved are inconsistent and disputed. One story of events asserts a skirmish took place in Khimki on 16 October at the Leningradskoe Shosse bridge involving a German motorcycle unit,Axis History but this would have been far from the main body of German forces at that time. Another account is a patrol reached Khimki around 30 November or early December before returning to its main unit without combat. The dates mentioned for this second account vary.Axis History A myth surrounding this is that the Germans would have been able to see the Kremlin 19 kilometres in the distance from Khimki. The Soviet Army counter offensive for \\"removing the immediate threat to Moscow\\" started on 5 December on the North-Western Front (the area around Khimki North West of Moscow). The South-Western Front and Western Fronts began their offensives on 6 December. The German forces were driven back. Moscow was never under such close land threat again during the war. A memorial in the form of a giant tank trap is located at the \\"Kilometer 23\\" point ) of Leningradskoye Highway (the highway to St. Petersburg). The memorial is south east of Planernaya Railway Station. The memorial was unveiled on 6 December 1966 as a 25th anniversary recognition of the launch of the Soviet counter offensive. This location is just short of an intersection with the Moscow-St Petersburg railway (close to where the IKEA shopping centre has since been built). This memorial and shopping centre on the Northern side of Khimki has a direct distance of 22 kilometres from Moscow city centre. At the time of the conflict this location was outside Khimki. This memorial is different to the Khimki War Memorial moved in 2007 to in Novoluzhinskoe cemetery. ===Post war=== Khimki was home to several Soviet aerospace defense development centers that became the principal employers for the majority of the city population. This included R&D; enterprises which designed surface-to-air missiles for S-75, S-125, S-200, S-300 Soviet air defense systems, engines for intercontinental ballistic missiles and satellite launch vehicles, and other types of equipment. For this reason, Khimki was off limits for all foreigners visiting the country, despite its location on a highway between Moscow and its major international airport. In 2010 the city saw protests over the construction of the new Moscow–Saint Petersburg motorway through the Khimki Forest. Currently, the city of Khimki is directly adjacent to the territory of the city of Moscow. In recent years the population of the city of Khimki has continued to grow rapidly due to massive residential building construction driven by its proximity to the densely populated Moscow megapolis, which needs new areas for expansion. ==Population== Population: 254,748 (2019 Census);Численность населения Российской Федерации по муниципальным образованиям на 1 января 2019 года 207,425 (2010 Census); 141,000 (2002 Census); 106,000 (1977); 23,000 (1939). ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Khimki City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #11/2013-OZ As a municipal division, Khimki City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Khimki Urban Okrug.Law #50/2005-OZ ==Economy== The city enjoys a great deal of commercial activity due to its location between Moscow and one of its main airports, Sheremetyevo. some aerospace-development centers located in Khimki contribute to a program of the International Space Station.

The station is managed by West Midlands Trains. It is served by three railway lines; the Trent Valley section of the West Coast Main Line (WCML), the Birmingham-Leicester-Peterborough Line and the Nuneaton to Coventry branch line. It was known, during the period 1924-1969 as Nuneaton Trent Valley, to distinguish it from the now closed Nuneaton Abbey Street station, though many local people still refer to it as Trent Valley. The station lies on the north- eastern edge of Nuneaton town centre, just outside the ring road. ==History19th and 20th century=== The original Nuneaton station was opened on 15 September 1847 when the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) opened the Trent Valley Line, the branch line to Coventry opened in 1850. The original station, like many others on the line had been designed by John William Livock: A simple two platform structure, it became inadequate to cope with the growing traffic, and was rebuilt on a larger scale with extra platforms in 1873. It was rebuilt and enlarged again in 1915 with its current buildings, which were designed by Reginald Wynn Owen. The station clock tower dating from 1915. In 1873 another line had opened; the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway, to link Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Coalville in order to access the large coal reserves located there. The line was closed to passengers in 1931 but remained open for goods until 1971. Part of it was later reopened as the heritage Battlefield Line. A second station in Nuneaton; Nuneaton Midland had been opened by the Midland Railway in 1864 on the line between Birmingham and Leicester. When both the LNWR and Midland Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1924, both station were renamed; the present station becoming known as Nuneaton Trent Valley, and the former Midland station becoming Nuneaton Abbey Street. Abbey Street station was closed in 1968, and the present station reverted to being called just 'Nuneaton', and took on the Birmingham to Leicester services. Other stations serving Nuneaton included the aforementioned Abbey Street, and two suburban stations at on the line towards Birmingham, and on the line to Coventry. These were all closed in the 1960s under the 1963 Reshaping of British Railways report, leaving only the present one. In addition, on 18 January 1965 the Coventry – Nuneaton Line closed to passengers, reopening to passengers in 1988. In 2016 a new station in Nuneaton; was opened on this line. ===21st century=== In 2004 Network Rail built two new platforms numbered 6 and 7 on the eastern side of the station. These were built as part of a grade separation project to separate trains on the Birmingham to Peterborough line, from those on the West Coast Main Line and so avoid the need for Birmingham- Leicester trains to cause conflicting movements by running across the WCML on the level: A disused flyover north of the station carrying Birmingham to Peterborough line over the WCML was restored to use, and a connection was built between this and the new platforms, which were dedicated to the Birmingham-Leicester-East Anglia services. In November 2012, the 0.9 mile Nuneaton North Chord opened to the north of the station. The chord allows freight trains approaching Nuneaton from Felixstowe via the Birmingham–Peterborough line, to join the northbound WCML after crossing the flyover, allowing them to avoid conflicts with southbound main line trains.\\"Nuneaton north chord officially opened\\" The Railway Magazine issue 1341 January 2013 page 9\\"New Nuneaton North Chord Opens\\" Today's Railways UK issue 133 January 2013 page 10 Map showing the railways around Nuneaton (Nuneaton on right). ==Layout and facilities== The station consists of one side platform (platform 1) on the western side of the station, and three island platforms containing platforms 2 to 7, all of which are linked by a footbridge which has full lift access. The main station building is adjacent to platform one and contains the main facilities, including a staffed ticket office and a cafe shop. ==Services== A Virgin Trains Class 390 Pendolino arrives at the platform. The two platforms 6 & 7 added in 2004, served by the Birmingham-Leicester-Peterborough Line. ;West Coast Main Line: West Midlands Trains operate an hourly service, southbound to via and , and northbound to via .Timetables London North Western Railway Avanti West Coast services from London Euston to Crewe, , , , and Manchester Piccadilly also call during peak hours.Timetables Virgin Trains Prior to December 2008, Virgin Trains was the sole provider of services to/from London; since then, London Midland and its successor West Midlands Trains has been the main provider. ;Birmingham to Peterborough Line: CrossCountry operate two trains per hour, westbound to , and eastbound to , one of these continues to via and . All services on this line use platforms 6 and 7.Timetables CrossCountry ;Coventry to Nuneaton Line: West Midlands Trains also provide an hourly service southbound to via . This normally uses platform 1. ==1975 accident== On the early hours of 6 June 1975, an overnight sleeper train from London to Glasgow derailed and crashed just south of Nuneaton station, killing six people and injuring 38. It was caused when the train ran onto a length of temporary track with a speed restriction at too high a speed; lighting equipment illuminating a board giving advance warning of the speed restriction failed, and this led the driver to wrongly conclude that it had been lifted, so he failed to slow down. One of the locomotives mounted the platform, causing damage to the station. A plaque commemorating the victims of the crash was unveiled at the station in August 2015. ==Motive Power Depot== The loco yard at Nuneaton Depot in 1953 The LNWR opened a small locomotive depot in 1847 which was used until 1878 when it was replaced by a larger facility. The engine sheds were doubled in size in 1888 and enlarged still further in 1892. This was an important freight Depot for the WCML and its connections at Trent Valley Station, also catering for local passenger services. It was located to the south of the station between the main line and that to Coventry. The depot closed 6 June 1966 and has since been demolished. ==See also== *Bermuda Park railway station *Nuneaton Abbey Street railway station *Stockingford railway station *Chilvers Coton railway station ==ReferencesExternal links== * Historical photographs of Nuneaton Station at warwickshirerailways.com Category:Railway stations in Warwickshire Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1847 Category:Railway stations served by Avanti West Coast Category:Railway stations served by CrossCountry Category:Railway stations served by West Midlands Trains Category:Nuneaton Category:Buildings and structures in Nuneaton Category:1847 establishments in England Category:John William Livock buildings ","title":"Nuneaton railway station"},{"id":"2001423","text":"Hoe or HOE may refer to: * Hoe (food), a Korean dish of raw fish * Hoe (letter), a Georgian letter * Hoe (tool), a hand tool used in gardening and farming * Backhoe, a piece of excavating equipment * HOE, pharmaceutical compound number prefix for Hoechst AG == People == * James Hoe, American academic * Richard March Hoe (1812–1886), American inventor * Robert Hoe (1784–1833), English-born American businessman, the father of Richard Hoe * Robert Hoe III (1839–1909), American businessman, the grandson of Robert Hoe == Places == * Hoe, Norfolk, a village in Norfolk, England, United Kingdom * Plymouth Hoe, a public space in Plymouth, England, United Kingdom == Other uses == * Ban Huoeisay Airport, in Laos * Chevrolet Tahoe, an American automobile * Heroes Over Europe, a video game * H0e scale, in model railroading * Holographic optical element * Homerville Airport, in Georgia, United States * Horom language, spoken in Nigeria * R.

It was developed by Desert Productions and released in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEI) and abroad by Eidos Interactive under their \\"Fresh Games\\" label on October 11, 2001 in Japan, then later in March 2002 for North America and Europe. Playing as the orchestra conductor Takt, the player must play the song by pressing the button according to the correct pressure on the screen. The game utilizes a soundtrack composed of entirely classical music by famous composers such as Beethoven, Brahmes, and Tchaikovsky. The game's original title was . Despite mixed critical reception in the west, the game was sold well and received positive reviews in its native Japan. This led to three Japan-only follow-ups with two \\"expansions\\", Bravo Music: Christmas Edition in 2001, and Bravo Music: Chou-Meikyokuban in 2002, and alongside them, a proper sequel called Let's Bravo Music also in 2002. ==Gameplay== Typically rhythm games rely on timed input according to on- screen cues and tempo. Mad Maestro features this style of gameplay, with the additional layer of pressure sensitivity. Utilizing the pressure sensitivity with the DualShock 2, the player must conduct an orchestra by tapping correlating buttons with varying degrees of pressure. There are three levels of pressure; light, medium and hard. By playing good and increasing their score, the player can reach Bravo Mode, which is required to beat the stage. By playing 3 or more notes bad however, the player is forced into Devil Mode, where their score will fall until they play a correct cycle perfectly. The Japanese release featured an optional Baton peripheral. ==Story== In Bravo Town, a young composer named Takt is the leader of an orchestral group known as the Bravo Youth Orchestra, and they perform at the town's Concert Hall. To modernize the town however, Bravo Town announces that they will tear down the hall. Prior to the date however, a fairy and overall guardian to the hall named Symphony awakens. She flies over to Takt's house, who tells him that the concert hall was around for a very long time, and that if it does get demolished, music could lose their power. So, she recognizes Takt's musical power and they decide to recruit various Bravo Town citizens to convince the town to keep the Concert Hall. After recruiting a couple, a clown and her lion partner, a fashion designer and a model, a reporter and some aliens, as well as a young flute prodigy and a long-forgotten-about composer, the new Bravo Youth Orchestra compose at the hall, which convinces the town to keep the hall as everyone returns to their life, and Symphony goes back to becoming the guardian of the Concert Hall. ==Characters== *: A young orchestra composer, and the main composer for the \\"Bravoes\\", an orchestra group created by himself. He is visited by the magical fairy Symphony while looking at new songs, who tells him about the demolition of the town's Concert Hall, and how him and his orchestra can save it with Takt's musical powers. Takt is also willing to help out other people with their problems with his powers, often whistling to get their attention. *: A magical fairy that was originally stone, but is awakened in the Concert Hall. She immediately goes to Takt to tell him about the demolition of the Concert Hall, and convinces him to save it. Before a stage, she tells what's the situation so that Takt can fix it. At the end of the game, she reverts to the stone statue, with Takt looking at her before leaving. She later appears in Let's Bravo Music, where she and Takt plan to restore the pages of the Legendary Opuses so she doesn't disappear alongside the power of music. *: A fashionable man who is Hannie's boyfriend. At the beginning of his stage, he and Hannie were supposed to meet for a date at the Bravo Town Park, but was extremely late, causing Hannie to get mad. Before the two could fight, Takt came and stopped them, using his musical powers to make them dance to Johannes Brahms' \\"Hungarian Dance No. 6\\". He is also one of five starting people Takt helped out to join him and help save the Concert Hall. In stage 7, he is trying to convince Hannie to join Takt, but fails, until some of the Bravoes help convince her to play along with the song that was currently playing. At the Final Concert, he plays the cello along with Hannie, and marries her during the credits scene. Darlin's name is based on the surname Darling, and he speaks in a stereotypical Italian accent. *: A blonde woman who is Darlin's girlfriend. She seems to have a very bad temper, as she gets mad at Darlin for being late to their date in stage 1. Later, while Darlin tells his friends that she began to play the cello, she is not convinced to join Takt and the Bravoes in stage 7, where Takt performs March from the Nutcracker by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky while Darlin tries to convince her as well. However, she soon warms up to Takt after stage 7, as she also helps Takt find someone to join them. She is friends with Nikki Domino. In the end, she marries Darlin. *: A reporter for BNN. In his stage, he and his crew are chasing after a UFO that has been spotted. As aliens come out of the UFO, Antonio waves to them, however the aliens begin to attack the area. As Antonio's crew flees, Takt comes to help Antonio and calm the aliens, playing Ride of the Valkyries from The Valkyrie by Richard Wagner. He also helps Takt to convince the aliens to join his orchestra during stage 10. During the final concert, Antonio plays the trumpet. Antonio later appears in Bravo Music: Chou-Meikyokuban, reporting that the aliens are coming from Mars to Earth to listen to the Bravoes. He pleads Takt and the Bravoes to use their music to make sure the aliens don't invade Earth. He also helps out along with Takt to come up with compositions for the concert for the aliens. Along with the aliens, Takt, and Symphony, Antonio is the only character to appear in another Bravo Music game outside of the original. *: A fashion designer, mainly known for designing the clothes Nikki Domino wears. In the cutscene of his stage, Nikki yells at him constantly before a fashion show, turning him into a nervous mess. Before he could freak out completely, Takt comes in to help both Nikki and Jean with the fashion show, playing \\"Finale from Carnival of the Animals\\" by Camille Saint-Saëns. He is also one of the 5 starting people to join Takt and help save the Concert Hall. He seems to even have a fear of Nikki, as he responded to Hannie with fear in his voice when she had said when she knew a top model who could help Takt. During the final concert, he plays the violin. *: A very popular supermodel. Just like Hannie, Nikki has a bad temper (Symphony even lampshades this), as she's often yelling at Jean at the designs of the outfits she has to wear. After Hannie's stage, she tells Takt that she knows Nikki, and she might be able to help. After convincing her during another fashion show by playing 40th Symphony K550/1st Movement by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, she admits that she doesn't know much about music, but she loves hard work, so she agrees to join Takt's orchestra. During the final concert, she plays the piano. During the ending, she is seen with Jean viewing another outfit, only to end with her yelling at him. She also attends Darlin and Hannie's wedding alongside the rest of the cast. *: A popular clown at the rundown circus. In her stage, she and her partner, Lionel Heart, are getting ready for a performance, however barely anyone comes to it. As her circus performer looks around in shock, Takt comes to help, playing Slavic Dance No. 7 by Antonín Dvořák as she performs. She is also one of the 5 starting people to help Takt, and plays the violin during the final concert. During the ending, she is seen with Lionel, happy that the circus has once again become popular. *: A popular lion that performs in the circus along with Lunar, however according to Symphony, he is simply a man in a costume. Takt and the Bravoes help him out during his performance in the circus, playing Marche Militarie by Franz Schubert as he performs on a unicycle and then a motorcycle. After his stage, he comments that if Lunar was helping out, then he'll help too. During the final concert, Lionel plays the drums. *: A young blue-haired boy who plays the flute. At the beginning of his stage, he is playing the flute peacefully before a raging storm interrupts him. As he watches birds fleeing, Takt comes along to help him from the storm, playing Scene from Swan Lake by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He is the last of the 5 starting people to help Takt. During the ending, he is seen playing his flute at sunset near the castle in his stage. *: A group of aliens who attack during Antonio's stage, however with Takt's musical powers, they were able to calm down. They appear in a later stage, where Antonio recommends recruiting them for the concert. Here, Takt performs Baba Yaga'a Hut from Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky. After their stage, Nikki is uncertain if Takt really wants to include the Martians in the orchestra, as it cuts to Lunar and Lionel bumping the Alien's heads together. During the final concert, the Aliens named , , and play the Marimba. The Alien race later appears in Bravo Music: Chou-Meikyokuban, as they plan to come to Earth in 5 days due to them wanting to hear Takt's music again. *: A fisherman who Symphony tells about after Adonis mentions he doesn't have any powerful friends. Takt finds Etoile down by the lake fishing and plays Dance of the Four Swans from Swan Lake by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. After his stage is completed, Jean-Paul Neostyle realizes he is Etoile, who was once a famous conductor. Much like Takt, he is silent, as he doesn't respond with words. When Symphony asks if he can play an instrument, he whips out a triangle and smiles, said triangle being his instrument for the final concert. Etoile's stage is the final stage before the final concert. ==Music list== The list of pieces of music in the order they appear on the game. 1\\\\.

It can be made as a sheet cake or a layer cake, or baked in a tube pan. The hot milk and butter give the cake a distinctive fine-grained texture, similar to pound cake. Hot milk cake gets its distinctive flavor from the scalded milk that is the liquid component of the batter. It differs from traditional sponge cakes like angel food cake in that it contains baking powder as leavening instead of just egg whites, so it can be made with butter like a Victoria sponge. The eggs are beaten together whole instead of whipped as yolks and whites separately. ==Preparation== Eggs are creamed with sugar, then flour is added. The milk is heated with butter until the butter has melted. This hot milk-butter mixture is poured into the batter all at once. The batter is mixed until it cools. Baking powder and vanilla flavor are added at the last stage before the cake is baked. This method gives the cake a fine-grained texture that is more similar to pound cake than traditional egg-leavened sponge cakes. ==History== A simple recipe from 1911 is made with sugar, eggs, flour, salt, baking powder and hot milk, with optional ingredients of chocolate, nuts or coconut. A recipe from Ruth Ellen Church, a former food editor for the Chicago Tribune who sometimes wrote under the pen name Mary Meade was published in 1955. It has mocha-flavored icing, and is moist and delicate. It is served every year since 1991 at the Anne Arundel County Historical Society's annual Strawberry Festival at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. ==See also== * List of cakes * List of regional dishes of the United States == References == Category:American cakes Category:Sponge cakes ","title":"Hot milk cake"},{"id":"2001445","text":"Anabel is a feminine given name.

Its southern terminus is at the Massachusetts state line in Fitzwilliam, where it continues south as Massachusetts Route 12. Its northern terminus is at the Vermont state line in Claremont (a terminus it shares with New Hampshire Route 103), where it continues north as Vermont Route 12. Most of the northern part of NH 12 runs along the Connecticut River. Its number is derived from its original 1922 designation as New England Interstate Route 12 (also known as the \\"Keene Way\\"). Present-day Vermont Route 12, New Hampshire Route 12, Massachusetts Route 12 and Connecticut Route 12 still mostly follow the original route. The four-state series of State Route 12s extend from Morrisville, Vermont to Groton, Connecticut. ==Route description Fitzwilliam to Keene === NH 12 begins in Fitzwilliam where it connects to Massachusetts Route 12 at the state line. The highway heads northwest into the town center where it crosses NH 119. NH 12 continues northwest through Troy, then dips into parts of Marlborough and Swanzey before entering the city of Keene. Immediately after crossing into Keene, NH 12 intersects the northern terminus of NH 32 then meets NH 101 near Keene State College. NH 12 turns west along NH 101, then meets NH 10 at a roundabout. NH 10 joins NH 12 and NH 101 west to the next intersection at NH 9. NH 101 ends while NH 10 and NH 12 turn north with NH 9 eastbound in tow. The three routes are multiplexed for as they bypass downtown Keene to the west. NH 9 and NH 10 split off at a trumpet interchange while NH 12 continues northwest. The highway interchanges with NH 12A on its way out of town. === Surry to Charlestown === NH 12 enters the southwestern corner of Surry, then turns nearly due west, crossing into the town of Westmoreland. It intersects the northern terminus of NH 63 near the Connecticut River, then turns north and enters Walpole. Now paralleling the eastern bank of the river, NH 12 heads north towards the town center. It intersects with NH 123, which connects to U.S. Route 5 in the neighboring town of Westminster, Vermont. NH 123 south joins NH 12 north and the two routes run in a wrong-way concurrency until crossing the Cold River, where NH 123 splits off to the east. NH 12 continues north along the river and crosses into Charlestown where it meets the northern terminus of NH 12A. The highway continues through downtown, then intersects NH 11, which connects to Interstate 91 and US 5 in nearby Springfield, Vermont. NH 11 east joins NH 12 north and the two routes continue north. A second, northern segment of NH 12A splits off to bypass Claremont while NH 11 and NH 12 head towards the downtown area. === Claremont === In downtown Claremont NH 11 and NH 12 intersect with NH 103 and split after a overlap. Facilitated by a traffic circle, NH 11 joins NH 103 eastbound while NH 12 joins NH 103 westbound. NH 12 and NH 103 cross the Sugar River, then parallel it to the northwest (which they do for the remainder of their lengths) back towards the Connecticut River. Heading west, NH 12 and NH 103 cross NH 12A, then turn northwest and cross the river into Ascutney, Vermont. NH 103 ends at the state line while NH 12 becomes Vermont Route 12. ==History== 93x93px NH 12 was originally designated in 1922 as part of New England Interstate Route 12, a regional highway stretching from Route 1 (modern U.S. Route 1, which partly runs on Interstate 95) in New London, Connecticut to Derby, Vermont, where it terminated at Route 2 (modern U.S. Route 5) near the border with Quebec. It was known as the \\"Keene Way,\\" reflecting its route through Keene, New Hampshire. In 1926, the New England road marking system was usurped by the system of United States Numbered Highways and in ca. 1932, Route 12 was redesignated as state highways bearing the number 12 (although a portion of Route 12 in southern Connecticut swapped designations with Route 32 at the same time). In the 1960s, VT 12 was truncated from Derby to its present terminus in Morrisville, with the former highway remaining as parts of VT 14, VT 16 and US 5. The highway as a whole has remained largely unchanged since. ==Junction listNew Hampshire Route 12A== Route 12A and Route 123 concurrency New Hampshire Route 12A is a designation held by two state highways which bypass separate sections of NH 12. Although not directly connected, the two segments are linked by an section of NH 12 in Charlestown. ===Southern segment=== The southern segment of NH 12A is a loop route of NH 12 which bypasses Westmoreland and Walpole. Its southern terminus is at an interchange with NH 12 in Keene. Its northern terminus is at an intersection with NH 12 in Charlestown. This section of NH 12A begins at an interchange with NH 12 north of downtown Keene. The highway initially heads northeast, then turns north to parallel the Ashuelot River and enters the town of Surry. NH 12A passes through the center of Surry and continues north into Alstead. In Alstead, NH 12A continues north until intersecting with NH 123. NH 12A joins NH 123 and the highway intersects NH 123A before turning west along the Cold River. The road turns north to cross the river, then NH 12A splits from NH 123. NH 12A continues northwest through the town of Langdon before crossing into Charlestown. NH 12A terminates at NH 12 in the southern end of town. ===Northern segment=== The northern segment of NH 12A is a long spur route of NH 12 that travels south-to-north along the eastern side of the Connecticut River. Its southern terminus is at an intersection with NH 11 and NH 12 in Charlestown. Its northern terminus is at US 4 and NH 10 in Lebanon. This section of NH 12A starts in northern Charlestown where it splits from NH 11 / NH 12. It runs along the eastern side of the Connecticut River, bypassing downtown Claremont to the west. After crossing the Sugar River, NH 12A crosses NH 12 and NH 103, which cross into Ascutney, Vermont just to the west. Now paralleling its parent route, which has become Vermont Route 12 across the river, NH 12A continues north into the town of Cornish. Bridge Street offers a local connection to VT 12, US 5 and VT 44 in neighboring Windsor, Vermont. NH 12A continues through western Plainfield without any major junctions, then enters the city of Lebanon. NH 12A continues north and interchanges with Interstate 89 before terminating at US 4 / NH 10 in West Lebanon village. ==Related routes== *20px New England Interstate Route 12, the designation carried by NH 12 in the 1920s ==See also== * * List of state highways in New Hampshire ==ReferencesExternal links== * New Hampshire State Route 12 on Flickr * New Hampshire State Route 12A on Flickr * Old New Hampshire State Route 12A on Flickr 012 Category:Transportation in Sullivan County, New Hampshire Category:Transportation in Cheshire County, New Hampshire Category:Keene, New Hampshire Category:Charlestown, New Hampshire Category:Claremont, New Hampshire ","title":"New Hampshire Route 12"},{"id":"2001465","text":"An omnibus survey is a method of quantitative marketing research where data on a wide variety of subjects is collected during the same interview.

The band has won the World Pipe Band Championships sixteen times. The current pipe major is Emmett Conway. ==History== The Shotts and Dykehead Caledonia Pipe Band was formed in 1910 by Pipe Major Dugald MacFarlane. The band purchased its first uniform with kilts of the McKenzie tartan in 1914, but despite entering many competitions, the band did not attain competitive success until Pipe Major Tom McAllister took the lead role in 1929. In 1935 the band won the Grade 2 world championship, and were upgraded to Grade 1 for the 1936 season, when they won the British Championship on the first attempt. After a suspension of competitions during the Second World War, the band won the World Championships in 1948 and 1952 under Tom McAllister, for a total of 21 major championships during his leadership of the band. Tom McAllister's son John Kerr McAllister took over as pipe major in 1954, in partnership with leading drummer Alex Duthart. Under this leadership, the band won four consecutive World Championships, between 1957 and 1960, setting a record for the time. After losing several members, including Alex Duthart, and not competing in 1963, Willie Stevenson was appointed as leading drummer and the band resumed competition in 1964. John Kerr McAllister retired in 1968, having led the band to 26 major championship victories, to be succeeded by his younger brother Tom McAllister Junior. Alex Duthart returned in 1970, and in the next twelve years before Tom retired the band won a further 23 major championships. Alex retired in 1982 and Tom in 1984, and were succeeded by leading drummer John Scullion and pipe major James A. Bell. At the end of 1986, Robert Mathieson and Jim Kilpatrick, former members of the band, took over as pipe major and leading drummer respectively. The band won 30 major championships under Mathieson, who retired at the end of 2010 to be replaced by Gavin Walker. Following the unexpected resignation of Gavin Walker just prior to the 2012 World Championships, Ryan Canning was appointed as the new pipe major of the band. The band did not, however, compete in the World Championships that year, partially due to Kilpatrick's suspension by the RSPBA over a comment posted on Facebook. In 2013, the band announced the end of its decade long sponsorship from The House of Edgar and the name reverted to Shotts and Dykehead Caledonia Pipe Band. In 2015, Shotts won the World Championships again, the first major championship won under Canning and the first victory by a Scottish band since Shotts won the title in 2005. Kilpatrick left the band in October 2015, a statement from the band reported that Kilpatrick had agreed to step down and retire from his position as leading drummer, and that corps member Blair Brown would be his replacement. but in his own statement Kilpatrick stated that his removal from the band was \\"the final act in a long-running, premeditated and well-planned coup d’état orchestrated by Ryan Canning, Blair Brown, Glenn Brown and perhaps three other members of the Shotts band.\\" Emmett Conway took over as pipe major of the band in late 2018. ==Pipe Majors== *Dugald MacFarlane (1910–1929) *Tom MacAllister Sr. (1929–1954) *J.K.

Smeal is the president and a cofounder of the Feminist Majority Foundation (founded in 1987) and has served as president of the National Organization for Women for three terms, in addition to her work as an activist, grassroots organizer, lobbyist, and political analyst. Smeal has appeared frequently on television, on shows including Crossfire, Good Morning America, Larry King Live, Nightline, and The Today Show. She has also appeared frequently on radio and testified before Congress. Smeal has organized numerous events around and given speeches on the concepts of feminism, equality, and human rights as they pertain to people in and outside of the United States. ==Early life and education== She is of Italian ancestry, born on July 30, 1939, to Peter Anthony Cutri and Josephine E. (Agresti), in Ashtabula, Ohio. Her father emigrated to America from Calabria, Italy and became an insurance salesman. After graduating from Strong Vincent High School in 1957, Smeal attended Duke University. At the time, Duke was not integrated and women made up only 25% of the enrolled students. Smeal participated in the fight for integration at Duke and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1961. She also holds an M.A. in political science and public administration from the University of Florida. Since 2001, Smeal is also the publisher of Ms. magazine which is owned and published by the Feminist Majority Foundation. == Personal life == While attending Duke University Eleanor met Charles Smeal, an engineering student, whom she married on April 27, 1963. Eleanor and Charles had two children together and lived in the area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Smeal's interest in feminism and her awareness of feminist issues became increasingly stronger during the late 1960s. Already confronted with a lack of day-care facilities for her young child, while also dealing with a back disability, Smeal realized there was no disability insurance for wives and mothers. It was this issue that pushed Smeal into researching further into feminism. Then in 1968, Smeal began a term lasting four years on the board of the local League of Women Voters, and then two years later, joined (along with her husband) the National Organization for Women (NOW). ==Political activism== Smeal joined the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1970 and served as president from 1977 to 1982 and again from 1985 to 1987. During this time, in 1986, she led the first national pro-choice march, which drew over 100,000 activists to Washington, DC. After leaving NOW in 1987, Smeal saw a need for a new feminist organization that combined research, educational outreach, and political action. A 1986 Newsweek/Gallup poll reported that 56% of women in the US self-identify as feminists. Smeal reconciled her vision of a new feminist organization and the task of empowering women and men who support equity by cofounding the Feminist Majority Foundation in 1987. Several legislative measures bear Smeal's imprint including the Free Access to Clinic Entrances legislation (influenced by Madsen v. Women's Health Center) that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994, the unsuccessful attempt to defeat Proposition 209 in California, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Equal Credit Act, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, the Violence Against Women Act, the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the unsuccessful 1970s and 1980s fight to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. == Presidency in NOW organization  First Term of Presidency (1977-1979) === Eleanor Smeal was first elected as the President of NOW in 1977, preceded by President Karen DeCrow. In total, Smeal was elected as NOW's President three times. Smeal was elected at a time when conference delegates had authorized a NOW ERA (Equal Rights Amendment) Strike Force to campaign for ratification. Upon hearing that the deadline for the ratification for ERA, Smeal convinced Elizabeth Holztman, a member of the United States House of Representatives, to bring the proposal to Congress. In this time of great desire for equal rights, Smeal played a key role and was a major organizer of the 1978 March for ERA. This march brought over 100,000 marchers and as a result, Congress voted to extend the deadline for ERA to June 30, 1982. === Second Term of Presidency (1979-1982) === In 1979, Smeal was reelected as NOW's President, running for her second term as the head of the organization. In her second run as President, Smeal focused her efforts on making Social Security more fair for women, testifying against restrictions on abortion funding for military personnel and their dependents, and Lesbian and Gay rights. Smeal led NOW organizers to help stage the 1979 National March for Lesbian and Gay rights. At the time of Smeal's second term of Presidency in NOW, Ronald Reagan was also elected as the United States President. Around the time of his inauguration in January, Smeal and the NOW organization launched and led a national campaign to stop Reagan's anti-abortion \\"Human Life Amendment.\\" Smeal was also the first person to coin the term \\"gender gap\\" when she analyzed in the National NOW Times just how different the votes by men versus the votes by women really are. Despite the grand efforts made by NOW during Smeal's presidency to get the ERA ratified, towards the end of Smeal's second term in 1982, the Amendment was shy three states and therefore did not get passed. At the end of her second term, which lasted longer than a traditional two-year term due to the decision to allow Smeal to continue her efforts, uninterrupted, on ratifying the ERA, Smeal had boosted NOW to a whopping 220,000 members and a budget of $13 million annually. While Smeal worked extensively on the ERA, some members felt that she lacked focus in areas such as minority and abortion rights, which became part of the focus of Smeal's successor, Judy Goldsmith. === Third Term of Presidency (1985-1987) === Smeal's run for presidency the third time around was hard-fought against previous President Judy Goldsmith. Smeal initially supported Goldsmith when she ran for Presidency after Smeal's second term, but now challenged Goldsmith the second time around. Smeal, during a telephone interview, stated that while her and Goldsmith did not differ on the philosophical concepts of equal rights, they differed on the political realities of how to obtain those rights to the fullest. Much of the campaign focused not on the issues the candidates themselves supported, but rather on their tactical approaches towards the issues. One of the biggest reasons Smeal decided to run for yet another term as President was not only due to the support of many other NOW members, but from her wish that NOW could be more outspoken, assertive, and publicly active on multiple different issues. These issues included abortion rights, on the role of women in the church, and the Vatican's policy on reproduction. Smeal also noted that while Goldsmith was in power the organization lost its focus and membership declined and she wanted to do something about that. In July 1985, Smeal won by a 139-vote margin over Goldsmith. Upon being elected for the third and final time as NOW's President, Smeal stated she would continue Goldsmith's efforts on reproductive rights as well as set forth plans to stage a reproductive rights march for the next year. This march, which took place in 1986 was the first March for Women's Lives and brought over 150,000 people to Washington and Los Angeles in support of women's reproductive rights. In 1987 Smeal also founded the Feminist Majority. ==Recognition== In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Smeal's name and picture. Also in 1979, Time magazine chose her as one of 50 Faces for America's Future (August 6, 1979). In 1983, World Almanac chose Smeal as one of the most influential women in the United States. In 2010 Smeal delivered the commencement address at Rutgers University's graduation and was conferred a Doctorate of Human Letters honoris causa. In 2015 Smeal was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. U.S. News & World Report chose her as the fourth most influential Washington lobbyist. ==Writing== In 1980 she coined the term \\"gender gap\\" in reference to a difference in how men and women vote by political party; the term is now commonly used in writing with that meaning. Her 1984 book How and Why Women Will Elect the Next President successfully identified a gender gap in politics. She contributed the piece \\"The Art of Building Feminist Institutions to Last\\" to the 2003 anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium, edited by Robin Morgan. ==See also== *List of women's rights activists ==ReferencesExternal links== * Biography from FMF * Feminist Majority Foundation Homepage * * Eleanor Smeal interview on Liberadio(!) with Mary Mancini & Freddie O'Connell Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:American feminists Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Duke University alumni Category:People from Sandusky, Ohio Category:Presidents of the National Organization for Women Category:University of Florida alumni Category:Activists from Ohio ","title":"Eleanor Smeal"},{"id":"2001512","text":"Carl Mörner af Tuna Carl Carlsson Mörner (1 December 1755 in Jönköping - 24 June 1821 in Stockholm) was a Swedish nobleman, officer, and politician.

It includes a guyed mast with antennas attached at various heights. The mast is surmounted by a television transmitting antenna, which brings the total height of the structure to , making it the tallest structure in Wales.Gwynedd Council : Track & Trace Planning Applications : Application Details It is owned and operated by Arqiva. ==History== The station was built by the ITA in the early 1960s to provide a 405-line ITV Band III (VHF) TV service for north west Wales. Unlike the BBC, which served the area from Llanddona (on the island of Anglesey), Arfon gave better coverage to some areas. The tower was completed in 1962 and began broadcasting that same year. In October 1975 the site became a medium power UHF analogue colour television relay of Llanddona, at the time carrying BBC One, BBC Two and ITV. S4C was added in 1982. 405-line TV was finally discontinued in the UK in 1985, but it appears that Arfon's VHF transmitters were decommissioned a year early in 1984 and the transmitters themselves were reused for clinical radiotherapy. More recently, Police and Ambulance communications have been added, in addition to mobile (cellular) telephone antennas. In 1993, Classic FM began using the site for FM coverage of north west Wales in preference to Llanddona (the BBC's regional FM site), partly due to a dispute over BBC charges for sharing fees of its transmitter masts and antennas, but more because Arfon, in conjunction with Great Orme's Head (near Llandudno) gave Classic FM better coverage than the BBC sites. On 16 November 1998, local commercial radio station Champion 103 launched from studios in Bangor with its transmitter at Arfon. The mast had its aircraft warning lights replaced in Summer 2006 to red lamps employing arrays of ultrabright LEDs. On 18 July 2006, national digital radio network Digital One began broadcasting from the station. ==Coverage area== The primary television service area includes most of Anglesey and central parts of the Llŷn Peninsula, however many viewers in south Dublin and north County Wicklow can also receive Arfon's broadcasts. The radio service area is slightly larger, reaching further down Cardigan Bay towards Tonfanau near Tywyn. ==Channels listed by frequencyAnalogue television==9 November 1962 - October 1975==== Initially, Arfon was a relay of Preseli, receiving its 405-line VHF transmission off-air on channel 8 and rebroadcasting it on channel 10. {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !Frequency !VHF !kW !Service |- | |10 |10 |HTV Wales (Teledu Cymru until 1968) |} ====October 1975 - 1 November 1982==== With the coming of colour TV on 625 lines, Arfon acted as a relay of Llanddona, whilst continuing to relay Preseli's VHF transmission. {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !Frequency !VHF !UHF !kW !Service |- | |10 |— |10 |HTV Wales |- | |— |41 |3.6 |HTV Wales |- | |— |44 |3.6 |BBC2 Wales |- | |— |51 |3.6 |BBC1 Wales |} ====1 November 1982 - January 1984==== 1982 saw the rollout of the UK's 4th planned UHF television channel.

In its structure and functions, the cytochrome b6f complex bears extensive analogy to the cytochrome bc1 complex of mitochondria and photosynthetic purple bacteria. Cytochrome f (cyt f) plays a role analogous to that of cytochrome c1, in spite of their different structures. The 3D structure of Brassica rapa (Turnip) cyt f has been determined. The lumen-side segment of cyt f includes two structural domains: a small one above a larger one that, in turn, is on top of the attachment to the membrane domain. The large domain consists of an anti-parallel beta-sandwich and a short haem-binding peptide, which form a three-layer structure. The small domain is inserted between beta-strands F and G of the large domain and is an all-beta domain. The haem nestles between two short helices at the N terminus of cyt f. Within the second helix is the sequence motif for the c-type cytochromes, CxxCH (residues 21-25), which is covalently attached to the haem through thioether bonds to Cys-21 and Cys-24. His-25 is the fifth haem iron ligand. The sixth haem iron ligand is the alpha-amino group of Tyr-1 in the first helix. Cyt f has an internal network of water molecules that may function as a proton wire.

Some key benefits of this technology include seamless version updating for globally distributed applications and greater control of memory allocation to the Java virtual machine. Java Web Start was distributed as part of the Java Platform, and included in downloads of the JRE and JDK. It was deprecated by Oracle in Java SE 9 and removed in Java SE 11. The code for Java Web Start was not released by Oracle as part of OpenJDK, and thus OpenJDK originally did not support it. IcedTea-Web provides an independent open source implementation of Java Web Start that is currently developed by the AdoptOpenJDK community, RedHat and Karakun AG, and which is bundled in the official OpenJDK installer. Next to this OpenWebStart provides an open source based implementation that is based on IcedTea-Web but offers more features and commercial support options. == Functionality == Unlike Java applets, Web Start applications do not run inside the browser. By default they run in the same sandbox as applets, with several minor extensions like allowing to load and save the file that is explicitly selected by the user through the file selection dialog. Only signed applications can be configured to have additional permissions. Web Start has an advantage over applets in that it overcomes many compatibility problems with browsers' Java plugins and different JVM versions. Web Start programs are no longer an integrated part of the web page, they are independent applications that run in a separate frame. Web Start can also launch unmodified applets that are packaged inside .jar files, by writing the appropriate JNLP file. This file can also pass the applet parameters. Such applets also run in a separate frame. Applet launcher may not support some specific cases like loading class as resource. Like applets, Java Web Start is cross-platform. == Deprecation == As of JDK9, Java applets are deprecated by Oracle with Java Web Start being the intended replacement. JDK9 Release Notes https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform- group/moving-to-a-plugin-free-web In March 2018, Oracle announced it will not include Java Web Start in Java SE 11 (18.9 LTS) and later. Developers will need to transition to other deployment technologies. == Implementation == Early versions of Java Web Start came with an application manager where, e.g., Sun's demo applications could be launched The developer prepares a special XML file with JNLP extension. This file describes the application requirements, code location, parameters and additional permissions (if any). The browser downloads this file as any other and (following its MIME type, \`application/x-java-jnlp-file\`) opens it with Web Start tool. Web Start tool downloads all necessary resources and launches the application. Java Web Start provides a series of classes in the javax.jnlp package which provide various services to the application. Sun designed most of these services with the aim of allowing carefully controlled access to resources (such as files and the system clipboard) while restricting the application to authorized operations. Sun introduced version 1.0 of Web Start in March 2001, Java Web Start 1.0 press release while 64-bit Windows support was added only in Java 6Bug ID 4802695, Support 64-bit Java Plug-in and Java webstart on Windows/Linux on AMD64 (later than 64-bit Java was first available). Since J2SE 1.4 Web Start comes as a default part of Java Runtime Environment (JRE) called \`javaws\`, computer administrators no longer have to install it separately. == Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) == Programmers often speak of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) interchangeably with the term \\"Web Start\\". The JNLP protocol, defined with an XML schema, specifies how to launch Java Web Start applications. JNLP consists of a set of rules defining how exactly to implement the launching mechanism. JNLP files include information such as the location of the jar package file and the name of the main class for the application, in addition to any other parameters for the program. A properly configured browser passes JNLP files to a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which in turn downloads the application onto the user's machine and starts executing it. The development of JNLP took place under the Java Community Process as JSR 56. Important Web Start features include the ability to automatically download and install a JRE in the case where the user does not have Java installed, and for programmers to specify which JRE version a given program needs in order to execute. The user does not have to remain connected to the Internet to execute the downloaded programs, because they execute from a locally maintained cache. Updates of the software download from the Web and become available when the user has a connection to the Internet, thus easing the burden of deployment. Any computer user can use JNLP simply by installing a JNLP client (most commonly Java Web Start). The installation can occur automatically such that the end-user sees the client launcher downloading and installing the Java application when first executed. JNLP works in a similar fashion to how HTTP/HTML works for the web. For rendering an HTML webpage, after the user clicks on a weblink, the browser submits a URL to a webserver, which replies with an HTML file. The browser then requests the resources referred to by this file (images, css), and finally renders the page once it has received enough information. Page rendering usually starts before all resources have downloaded; some resources not critical to the layout of the page (such as images) can follow on afterwards. JNLP mirrors this process; in the same way that a Web browser renders a webpage, a JNLP client \\"renders\\" a Java app. After the user clicks on a weblink, the browser submits an URL to a webserver, which replies with a JNLP file (instead of a HTML file) for the application. The JNLP client parses this file, requests the resources specified (jar files), waits for the retrieval of all required resources, and then launches the application. The JNLP file can list resources as \\"lazy\\", which informs the JNLP client that the application does not need those resources to start, but can retrieve them later on when/if the application requests them. == Example == The example below gives a simple JNLP file to launch the applet, specifying code base, source, main class and window size. Such file contains all necessary references and is self-sufficient to launch the application. As no permissions are requested, the code will run in a sandbox. JNLP also states that this application can run offline (if already cached) and should be updated as a background process. Launch applet with Web Start Foo Bar Inc. == Pack200 compression == To reduce the size of a Java Web Start application Sun Microsystems introduced a compression system called Pack200 in Java 1.5.0. It can compress a large jar file to one-ninth of its original size if it contains only Java classes.Pack200 and Compression for Network Deployment Java Web Start has supported Pack200 since it first appeared, but initially this feature required server-side cooperation and a certain amount of expertise to set up. When Sun introduced Java SE 6u10, Pack200 support became available without the need for special server support. Application designers can enable or disable this feature within JNLP files. On slow connections Pack200 gives a performance boost in application startup time and download time. == Signed Web Start applications == By default, Java Web Start applications run \\"restricted\\", which means that they do not have access to some system resources such as local files. But publishers can remove these restrictions by signing their Web Start applications with the \`jarsigner\` tool that comes with the JDK. == Alternatives == The open-source IcedTea project provides an alternative JNLP implementation in IcedTea-Web. As of version 1.7.2, it also works on newer versions without official JWS support.icedtea-web. open sourc implementation of web start To run Java Web Start-based application after the release of Java 11, the company Karakun AG has released the open source tool OpenWebStart, based on IcedTea-Web. The tool includes all the functionality of IcedTea-Web and adds extended features, such as native installers for Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.

She was a fitness instructor from 1984 to 1986, when she began a four-year career as a schoolteacher. Schmidt was elected as a Miami Township trustee in 1989. When Clermont County Commissioner Jerry McBride resigned in 1991 to become a judge, Schmidt was one of four candidates to replace him, but wasn't appointed. In her 1993 bid for reelection, she finished first in a field of four, taking 3,639 votes. One major issue during her service on the Board of Trustees was the city of Milford annexing parts of the township. She and other trustees lobbied the Ohio General Assembly for new laws to protect townships from such annexations. In 1993, a panel of Miami Township residents recommended the township incorporate to protect itself from annexations, to have greater control over its territory, and to obtain more money from the state. However, Schmidt as a trustee was not a participant in this effort, saying she had to be a \\"cheerleader\\" on the sides. In 1995, she traveled to Russia to offer instruction about political campaigning in a country that had little experience of free elections. On her trip she ran in Moscow's Red Square: \\"Did I ever feel unsafe? No. And would I jog through Central Park in New York? No way.\\" Schmidt was reelected to a third term as trustee in 1997. She resigned her trustee seat to enter the Ohio House. The remaining two trustees appointed Mary Makley Wolff to the remainder of the term. == Ohio House of Representatives Elections=== The Ohio StatehouseIn 2000, Schmidt ran for the Ohio House of Representatives seat being vacated by Sam Bateman, who was prevented by term limits from running again. She told The Cincinnati Post that before Bateman had been appointed to the seat in the early 1980s, Clermont County Republican leaders \\"offered me the job on a silver platter\\" but she turned them down because her daughter was only four years old at the time. But in 2000, her daughter was in college and she decided to run. Unopposed in the March primary, The Cincinnati Enquirer endorsed her in the general election, writing \\"Seldom has a choice been more obvious than that between Republican Jean Schmidt and Democrat Sherrill Callahan.\\" Schmidt was easily elected to the 124th Ohio General Assembly from the 71st House District by defeating Callahan, a retired high school principal from Pierce Township. Schmidt received 36,433 votes (70.4 percent) to Callahan's 15,327 (29.6 percent). Her district was entirely within Clermont County, containing Miami Township as well as Batavia, Goshen, Pierce, Stonelick and Union Townships, plus the villages of Amelia, Batavia and the city of Milford, and the Clermont County part of the city of Loveland. After the redistricting necessitated by the 2000 census, her district became the 66th and contained the same territory minus Pierce and Stonelick Townships.\\" === Tenure === The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote she introduced and passed bills \\"remarkable in number and quality for a neophyte lawmaker.\\" She sponsored legislation on the Clermont County courts,New Clermont clerk job on way June 30, 2003. limiting the ability of public employees to collect both pension and salary simultaneously (\\"double dipping\\"),cincypost.com, \\"Ohio moves to end double dipping\\", February 9, 2001. urban townships, and protecting townships from annexations of their territory by cities, all of which were passed into law. She also pushed legislation on the health of women, suicide prevention, abstinence education, and to \\"lock killers away for good\\" by making it easier for judges to sentence murderers to life terms. Schmidt also supported Ohio's concealed carry law.Concealed carry rules January 8, 2004. === Committee assignments === In the House she served on the Finance and Appropriations; Human Services and Aging; Banking, Pensions and Securities; and Public Utilities Committees. She was excited to be in the Statehouse: \\"Oh my God, I'm really a state representative\\" she was overheard telling a fellow freshman. In 2002, she was elected to the 125th General Assembly without opposition in both the primary and general elections. ==2004 Ohio state senatorial election== In 2004, she ran for the 14th District seat in the Ohio Senate to replace Senate President Doug White, who was retiring. The Senate seat included Clermont, Brown, Adams and Scioto counties and part of Lawrence County. Her opponent for the Republican nomination was Tom Niehaus, a fellow member of the Ohio House from New Richmond whose 88th District represented the half of Clermont County outside her district plus Brown and Adams Counties to the east. Schmidt told the Enquirer \\"The fear from many of the people I meet is that because the next senator will come from Clermont County, they will be underrepresented. But if you know anything about me, I don't under-represent anybody.\\" She also said she worried about the state budget: \\"We do have a history of overspending in Ohio. But it's not just recent history. It's a 40-year-old habit.\\" The Enquirer was dismayed by advertisements from the Ohio Taxpayers Association \\"twisting the two candidates' voting records to Schmidt's advantage\\" and endorsed Niehaus.Endorsements in GOP legislative races February 29, 2004.Candidate Q&A;: Ohio 14th District state Senate seat February 18, 2004. Schmidt had endorsements from key state leaders such as Ohio State Treasurer Joe Deters and Speaker of the Ohio House Larry Householder. The campaign was marred by allegations that Householder's staff had improperly tried to obtain Niehaus's withdrawal from the race and that Householder had told Niehaus's supporters to donate money to Schmidt's campaign.cincypost.com, \\"A cloud of smoke\\", March 13, 2004. In the initial count of the Republican primary vote on March 2, 2004, she led by just 62 votes. A recount was automatically ordered, which reversed the outcome. Schmidt ultimately lost by just 22 votes: 17,076 (49.9%) to Niehaus's 17,098 (50%). She told The Cincinnati Enquirer on election night \\"This is the way my whole life has been—one tough race after another.\\"62-vote difference means a recount in state Senate March 3, 2004. == U.S. House of Representatives Elections=== ;2005 When President George W. Bush nominated Rob Portman, who had just been elected to a sixth full term, to be U.S. Trade Representative, eleven Republicans entered the race for his seat. Schmidt launched her campaign for Congress in Montgomery on April 11, the first candidate from outside Hamilton County to declare. She emphasized the need for all parts of the district to be represented: \\"We must always balance the interests of Hamilton County, which is more urban, with those of the more rural part of our district.\\" She said of her predecessor, \\"While I know that I cannot fill Rob's shoes, I know that I am the right person to continue the tradition of leadership and character.\\" Early polling showed Hamilton County Commissioner Pat DeWine leading at 42%, with Schmidt tied for third at 7%. In her campaign, Schmidt ran on a conservative platform. In one mailing to voters, she promised to \\"reduce our taxes\\", \\"keep our nation safe\\", advocated \\"a responsible energy policy\\", and for \\"promoting family values.\\" The tag line on the mailer was \\"continuing a tradition of character and leadership.\\" Schmidt's campaign literature noted her anti-abortion voting record, her opposition to same-sex marriage, her high ratings from the National Rifle Association, and that she \\"opposes an activist court system that acts against our conservative values.\\" The literature also featured her endorsement by Phil Fulton, a pastor who fought the court ordered removal of tablets containing the Ten Commandments from the grounds of schools in Adams County. A major factor in the primary campaign was Pat DeWine's marriage. In 2004, DeWine's opponent ran ads calling attention to DeWine leaving his pregnant wife and their two children for a mistress working as a lobbyist. Schmidt made it a point in her stump speech to emphasize how long she had been married to her husband: \\"I am a woman of character who has been married for twenty-nine years.\\"DeWine's name helps – and hurts June 1, 2005. On June 14, 2005, Schmidt finished first in the Republican primary, with 31 percent of the vote. McEwen finished second with 25 percent, Brinkman was third with 20 percent, and DeWine had 12 percent. Two days after the primary, an editorial cartoon in The Cincinnati Enquirer, commenting on DeWine's marriage being such a factor in the primary, showed Schmidt asking Paul Hackett, who had won the Democratic primary, \\"You have a good marriage. I have a good marriage. What the heck are we going to campaign about?\\"Jim Borgman cartoon June 2005. Many politicos blame Dewine's barrage of attacks on McEwen as the main reason for Schmidt's win.Candidates toe the line on 'values' June 3, 2005.The mud's flying in 2nd Dist. campaign June 5, 2005. Schmidt faced Democratic nominee Paul Hackett, in the August 2, 2005, special election. Hackett criticized Schmidt as a \\"rubber stamp\\" for Governor Bob Taft's \\"failed policies\\", and claimed she would continue in that role for George W. Bush if elected. At their debate at Chatfield College, Hackett said \\"If you think America is on the right track and we need more of the same, I'm not your candidate\\" and asked \\"Are you better off today than you were five years ago?\\", echoing Ronald Reagan's question in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980. \\"Rubber stamp\\" was Hackett's catchphrase throughout the campaign. Hackett even appeared in front of the Hathaway Rubber Stamp store in downtown Cincinnati on July 27 to emphasize the point. \\"If you think America needs another career politician steeped in a culture of corruption who does as she's told and toes the line on failed policies, then I'm not your candidate,\\" he wrote in a guest column for The Cincinnati Post. However, Schmidt said that she was proud to be associated with Bush, sending campaign mail with a photograph of them together in the Oval Office. A month before the election the inspector general of the Ohio General Assembly announced he was investigating three legislators for accepting gifts and failing to report them. Schmidt was implicated in this, but could not be investigated because she was no longer a member of the Ohio house. (The others were Representatives Jim Raussen of Springdale, Michelle G. Schneider of Madeira, and Diana M. Fessler of New Carlisle.) On October 24, 2004, the legislators had accepted dinner at Nicola's Ristorante on Sycamore Street in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood and Cincinnati Bengals tickets from a lobbyist for pharmaceutical company Chiron. Schmidt said she thought her $644 gift was from former Bengals player Boomer Esiason, who was, like Chiron, interested in cystic fibrosis. Schmidt repaid the lobbyist for the cost of the entertainment. Her spokesman told The Columbus Dispatch \\"Jean specifically asked if this was a reportable gift. We immediately corrected it by paying the full price of the tickets.\\" Her former colleague Raussen blamed the lobbyist. \\"Here we have a lobbyist who was extremely sloppy.\\" Hackett hammered on Schmidt's ethics. When she denied she knew or ever met Thomas Noe, at the center of the Coingate investment scandal at the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, Hackett produced minutes from a meeting of the Ohio Board of Regents that showed Schmidt had indeed met with Noe, once a regent. On July 29, the Toledo Blade reported on a 2001 e-mail from Taft's assistant Jon Allison complaining Schmidt was \\"bugging\\" him about setting up an Internet lottery for Cincinnati businessman Roger Ach, who gave her a $1,000 contribution the next year. Schmidt spokesman Fritz Wenzel said the candidate did not recall any conversations with the governor about Ach's business.Four face ethics probe July 8, 2005.Debate shows differences July 8, 2005.Schmidt chips in another $20K for home stretch July 22, 2005. The candidates participated in only two debates. The first was held on July 7 at Chatfield College in St. Martin in Brown County, moderated by Jack Atherton of WXIX-TV, the Fox Network affiliate in Cincinnati. Hackett told the audience his opponent was \\"a rubber stamp for failed policies\\" and \\"if you think America is on the right track and we need more of the same, I'm not your candidate.\\" The second debate was held July 26 at the Ohio Valley Career and Technical Center in West Union in Adams County. Howard Wilkinson of The Cincinnati Enquirer said Hackett in the second debate was \\"trying to paint Schmidt as a Taft-Bush robot.\\" The two also made joint appearances on WCET-TV's Forum on July 28 and WKRC-TV's Newsmakers on July 31.Schmidt has had lifelong drive to succeed July 24, 2005.Anti-tax group, liberal PAC airing 'don't vote' message July 29, 2005.FOP decries Hackett suit, endorses rival July 28, 2005.Money pouring into race July 29, 2005.Schmidt can't recall Ach favor July 30, 2005.Schmidt for Congress: Republican offers better experience, fit for 2nd District July 31, 2005. The Cincinnati Enquirer ran a front page story on July 2 reporting on the candidates financial disclosure statements that revealed both were millionaires. Schmidt was worth between $1,700,000 and $6,800,000; most of her wealth was her share of RTJJ, LLC, a real estate company owned with her three siblings. Hackett was worth between $650,000 and $1,600,000. (These figures did not include the value of either's home. The Clermont County Auditor valued Schmidt's home on at $138,510 and the Hamilton County Auditor valued Hackett's home on at $552,800.) Schmidt used her own wealth in the campaign. She told The Cincinnati Post the week before the election she put $200,000 of her money in the campaign that she had planned to use to buy a condominium in Florida. The paper noted the median household income in the district was $46,813. Hackett attracted national attention in newspapers, and expenditures by both parties at the national level. The National Republican Congressional Committee announced on July 28 it was spending $265,000 for television ads in the Cincinnati market, covering the western part of the district, and $250,000 for ads in the Huntington, West Virginia, market, covering the eastern half. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) responded with commercials noting that Schmidt had voted to raise the sales tax by 20% and the excise tax on gasoline by 30 percent when she was in the legislature. A DCCC mailing to voters reiterated these charges under the headline \\"Who Voted for the Taft Sales Tax Increase—the Largest in Ohio History?\\" and asked \\"can we trust Jean Schmidt to protect middle-class families in Washington?\\" Schmidt defeated Hackett 52%–48%, a margin of three points, the worst showing of any Republican in the district since 1974, but which made her the second Republican woman elected to Congress from Ohio in her own right (behind Deborah Pryce) and the first woman to represent southwestern Ohio in Congress. Schmidt in her victory speech late on election night declared: > We began this race way back in late March, and no one had thought we'd be > the focus of the national media or be the so-called first test of the > Republican Party and the Bush mandate. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we passed > that test. ;2006 Schmidt faced Democrat Victoria Wells Wulsin, a doctor from Indian Hill in the November general election. During Schmidt's re-election bid there were several controversies, which affected her campaign. One was a March 2006 report about Schmidt's past claims that she had a B.A. in secondary education from the University of Cincinnati, awarded in 1986. Schmidt's defenders pointed out that neither her current official or campaign website had the second degree posted, and said that Schmidt had completed the requirements for the degree but never filed the paperwork to be awarded a diploma. On April 27, five days before the May 2 primary, the Ohio Elections Commission voted 7-0 to issue Schmidt a public reprimand for \\"false statements\\" for her claiming to have that second degree. The Commission also found that Schmidt had made false claims of being endorsed by several organizations, but that these did not warrant any reprimand. Schmidt won the Republican primary defeating former U.S. Congressman Bob McEwen 48%–43%. She defeated Wulsin 51%–49%, a difference of 2,865 votes, and a margin of 1.3%. This was the closest a Republican had come to losing the seat in 42 years. Schmidt held her seat by winning her home base in Clermont County by almost 8,000 votes. ;2008 On January 20, 2008, Schmidt received the Hamilton County Republican Party's endorsement for the March 4 Republican primary.Schmidt gets endorsed by Hamilton Co. GOP The Cincinnati Enquirer. January 20, 2008. In the Republican primary, she defeated State Representative Tom Brinkman Jr. 58%–40%. The Schmidt campaign sent out a fundraising letterThe TPM DOCUMENT COLLECTION – Jean Schmidt Fundraising Letter accusing her Democratic opponent, Victoria Wulsin of harboring a \\"contempt for the culture of life\\" that led her to \\"participate in grotesque medical experiments\\" involving injections of \\"malaria virus\\" into AIDS patients in Africa and China without their consent. The Wulsin campaign vigorously denied the charges. The \\"grotesque medical experiments\\" charge appears to be a reference to 2004 work that Wulsin did with the Heimlich Institute in Ohio. She examined data that was supplied to her as part of a literature review, taken from ongoing studies, of experimental AIDS therapies that Wulsin concluded had potential. \\"She never participated in any of the studies,\\" said Wulsin communications director Kevin Franck. \\"She was never in a position to stop any of them while they were in progress ... Jean Schmidt knew that those complaints and those allegations had no merit when she mailed the letter.\\"House GOPer Accuses Dem Foe Of ...\\"Grotesque Medical Experiments\\" On Human Guinea Pigs, June 11, 2008. There is also no such thing as a malaria virus, as malaria is caused by protozoans. Schmidt was struck by a hit and run driver while jogging, and was diagnosed with two broken ribs and two fractured vertebrae.Schmidt's injuries worse than previously thought Dayton Daily News October 14, 2008. The injuries were not diagnosed immediately after the accident. However, the week following the accident she was embarking on a weekend fact-finding visit to Afghanistan when severe pain caused her to pass out while landing at a U.S. Air Force Base in Germany. As a sign of respect, her Democratic opponent, Victoria Wulsin, suspended her campaign while Schmidt rested at home. Schmidt defeated Wulsin and David Krikorian 45%–37%–18%.Congresswoman Jean Schmidt Wins Re-Election November 5, 2008. She underperformed Republican presidential nominee John McCain, who received 59% of the vote in the district. Obama garnered 40% in the district, performing slightly better than Wulsin. ;2010 In the Republican primary, she defeated County Commissioner Mike Kilburn, Debbi Alsfelder, and Tim Martz 62%–22%–9%–7%. In the general election, she won re-election to a third term by defeating Surya Yalamanchili 58%–35%. ;2012 In the March Republican primary, Schmidt was unexpectedly defeated by Iraq war veteran Brad Wenstrup 49%–43%. She carried six counties (all located in eastern part of the CD), while Wenstrup only won two counties (both located in the western part of CD): Hamilton County (59%) and Clermont County (50%). ===Tenure=== In Congress, Schmidt sponsored non-binding resolutions that states hit by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita should adopt a uniform statewide building code (H. Con. Res. 285); that the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance were not an unconstitutional endorsement of religion (H. Res. 453); and supporting Gold Star Mothers (H. J. Res. 61). As of 2005, she was the original sponsor of one bill, H.R. 4180, a campaign finance reform measure \\"to require communications that consist of prerecorded telephone calls to meet the disclosure and disclaimer requirements applicable to general public campaign communications transmitted through radio.\\" She cosponsored bills to provide ultrasounds to pregnant mothers (H.R. 216); to require women having abortions be \\"fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child\\" (H.R. 356); to allow free mail from families to servicemen in Iraq and Afghanistan (H.R. 923); to require the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw its approval of the abortifacient drug RU-486 because of safety concerns (H.R. 1079); the \\"District of Columbia Personal Protection Act\\", which would repeal District of Columbia law forbidding residents from owning guns (H.R. 1288); to ban human cloning (H.R. 1357); to repeal the excise tax on telephones (H.R. 1898); to forbid federal courts from hearing cases on the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance (H.R. 2389); and to limit the use of eminent domain by the states, a reaction to the Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London (H.R. 4128). ;Swearing In Schmidt was sworn in on the evening of September 6, 2005. (Ordinarily, representatives chosen in special elections take office immediately, but the House was in its August recess at the time of the election.) In her maiden speech, Schmidt said: ;Environment Schmidt has called for reducing America's dependence on foreign oil by increasing use of ethanol and drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Schmidt told The Cincinnati Post \\"What's really important is to adopt an environmental policy that advances the American economy and national security. I supported the energy bill recently passed by the U.S. House that will expand the use of alternative energy sources and additives like ethanol.\\" The League of Conservation Voters, a political action committee advocating for environmental concerns, gave Schmidt a lifetime average of 6 on a scale of 0 to 100. In 2005, she was rated at 0. ;Taxes and spending Schmidt supported the tax cuts championed by President George W. Bush. Schmidt called for additional changes to the Internal Revenue Code, such as adopting a flat tax and repealing the estate and capital gains taxes. Schmidt also professed to be a fiscal conservative. A mailing sent to voters listed four examples of \\"wasteful spending in Washington,\\" which included \\"$45,000 to buy gold plated playing cards for Air Force Two!\\" and \\"$1.2 million to study the breeding habits of a woodchuck!\\" ;Abortion Schmidt is strongly anti-abortion. When she launched her candidacy, she was president of the Right-to-Life of Greater Cincinnati. At the Chatfield College debate, Schmidt said Roe v. Wade was \\"a flawed law made by activist judges\\" and would \\"love to see\\" it reversed. Schmidt mailed literature to voters with an endorsement from Paula Westwood, executive director of Cincinnati Right-to-Life: > Jean's legislative experience is invaluable to Right to Life of Greater > Cincinnati's efforts and goals for the coming years. But more importantly, > she has a tenacious devotion to the sanctity of human life from conception > to natural death already demonstrated in her political and private life. ;Iraq War Schmidt made the Iraq War an issue in the race. She declared on WCET-TV's Forum that \\"9/11 was a wakeup call. We lost our innocence\\" and praised the Bush foreign policy. \\"The foundation of democracy that has been planted in Afghanistan and Iraq\\", she said, has inspired reforms in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. At the Chatfield College debate on July 7, she said of Iraq and Saddam Hussein \\"We have toppled a terrorist regime, a terrorist madman who now sits in a prison cell. This country has gone to the ballot box and made its decision to become a democratic regime.\\" Schmidt appeared in public with a button in her lapel containing a photograph of Matt Maupin, who was at the time the only prisoner of war of the Iraq campaign who had not been freed and who was a native of Clermont County. === Committee assignments === * Committee on Agriculture ** Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management ** Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture (Chairwoman) * Committee on Foreign Affairs ** Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia ** Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere * Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ** Subcommittee on Aviation ** Subcommittee on Highways and Transit ** Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials == Controversies  \\"Coward\\" remarks === On November 18, 2005, the House debated a Republican-sponsored resolution, H. Res. 572, calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq. It was prompted by the call of John P. Murtha, Jr., a Democrat from Pennsylvania, who introduced H.J. Res. 73, which called for the redeployment of American forces as soon as possible. In response, Armed Services Committee chairman Duncan L. Hunter of California introduced H. Res. 571, which the Republican leadership admitted was intended to demonstrate that calls for troop withdrawal were \\"out of the mainstream.\\" Democrats in turn roundly criticized the Hunter resolution as a sham that misstated Murtha's position. During debate on adopting the rule for debating the resolution, H. Res. 563, Schmidt said: > Yesterday I stood at Arlington National Cemetery attending the funeral of a > young Marine in my district. He believed in what we were doing is the right > thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few > minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative > from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send > Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman > Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the > rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will > see this through. October 21, 2006. Schmidt's remarks threw the House into an uproar and earned her the sobriquet \\"Mean Jean\\". Many Democrats saw it as an unwarranted attack against Murtha, a 38-year Marine Corps veteran. After she said \\"cowards cut and run, Marines never do,\\" angry Democrats nearly drowned out her words. Victor F. Snyder, a former Marine, of Arkansas demanded that Schmidt's remarks be \\"taken down.\\" Under this disciplinary procedure, the House clerk would have re-read Schmidt's words and the presiding officer (at the time, Michael K. Simpson of Idaho) would have ruled whether they were parliamentary. Had they been ruled unparliamentary, Schmidt would not have been able to speak for the rest of the day without permission. After 10 minutes, Schmidt asked for and received permission to withdraw her remarks and apologized to Murtha.Congressional Record November 18, 2005. A spokeswoman for Bubp said that the state representative \\"did not mention Congressman Murtha by name nor did he mean to disparage Congressman Murtha\\" and that he felt \\"the words that Congresswoman Schmidt chose did not represent their conversation.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Bubp said \\"he never mentioned ... Murtha . . . by name when talking with Schmidt, and he would never call a fellow Marine a coward.\\" === Fake endorsements === On March 8, 2006, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Representatives Tom Tancredo of Colorado and Steve Chabot of Ohio stated they had not endorsed Schmidt even though Schmidt's campaign site claimed they had. Chabot later said he had endorsed both Schmidt and her primary opponent. Schmidt also claimed an endorsement from the Family Research Council, which was repudiated by the organization. After a review, the Ohio Elections Commission found that the Tancredo and Family Research Council endorsement claims were false but did not warrant any reprimand. === Second bachelor's degree === WLW-AM reported on March 28, 2006, that Schmidt had, since 1989, claimed a B.A. in secondary education from the University of Cincinnati awarded in 1986. Schmidt had previously listed two degrees on candidate guides, her official Ohio House bio, and past campaign websites. But after her election to Congress, neither her current official or campaign website had the second degree posted. Schmidt's chief of staff, Barry Bennett, told The Plain Dealer Schmidt had completed the requirements for the degree but never filed the paperwork to be awarded a diploma. \\"I think it's fair to say that she earned it and never collected it,\\" Bennett said.Jean Schmidt's shifting bio (with update) March 31, 2006. On April 27, five days before the May 2 primary against McEwen, the Ohio Elections Commission voted 7–0 to issue Schmidt a public reprimand for \\"false statements\\" for her claiming to have a second undergraduate degree from the University of Cincinnati that she was not awarded. The Commission wrote in its letter of reprimand that Schmidt had \\"reckless disregard for truth.\\" Schmidt insisted the error regarding her degrees was a mistake by her staff. On May 1, the day before the election, Schmidt appeared on Bill Cunninham's show on WLW-AM in Cincinnati and was asked by a caller about the OEC reprimand. Schmidt repeated her insistence the error was caused by the designer of her website incorrectly listing her teaching certificate as a degree in secondary education and social studies. === Obama's birth certificate === At the Voice of America Tea Party on September 5, 2009, Schmidt, in response to a woman who said that Barack Obama \\"cannot be a president by our constitution,\\" replied, \\"I agree with you, but the courts don't.\\" September 5, 2009. Schmidt's statement to the woman appeared to contradict a statement Schmidt made in July 2009 to Loveland Magazine in which she said that \\"The President is indeed a Citizen of this country\\" and that she \\"voted as a Member of the House to certify the vote of the Electoral College electing him as our President.\\"Jean Schmidt Not a Birther July 2009. === \\"Obamacare\\" ruling === On June 28, 2012, a video was captured of Schmidt enthusiastically responding to erroneous reports from Fox News Channel that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was overturned by the Supreme Court in the landmark National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius ruling.Hardball Sideshow – Matthews pokes fun at GOPers who thought mandate was overturned June 2012. === Armenian Genocide denial === In 2009 Armenian-American candidate David Krikorian called out Schmidt for her failure to publicly define the Armenian Genocide as a genocide. His concern arose from a statement released by Schmidt's office noting that \\"at this time she [Schmidt] does not have enough information to characterize these deaths as genocide especially since those responsible are long since dead.\\" A few days before the 2008 congressional election, Krikorian published a letter stating that \\"Jean Schmidt has taken $30,000 in blood money from Turkish government sponsored political action committees to deny the slaughter of 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children by the Ottoman Turkish Government during World War I.\\" Finally, the flier asserted that it could be adequately verified by the Federal Election Commission's website. He repeated the letter to the Ohio Elections Commission. The Ohio Elections Commission issued a split decision on the case, failing to find that all of the preceding three remarks had been published in violation of ORC 3517.21(B)(10) by clear and convincing evidence. In a series of 4 panel votes, Commissioners affirmed that Turkish American funds are a primary source of support for Rep. Schmidt's political campaign, but chided Krikorian for statements related to Turkish Government funding of his opponent, because such a funding would be illegal. The votes were taken after a panel decision to disregard testimony provided regarding the Armenian Genocide and its denial, which was criticized by David Krikorian's party and supporters. Schmidt also attempted, to no avail, to press criminal charges against Krikorian for his statements. Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator, testified on behalf of Krikorian during the Ohio Elections Commission hearing and spoke about Turkey's connections to Schmidt. In October 2010, a federal court rejected David Krikorian's appeal. In June 2010, Schmidt unsuccessfully filed a $6.8 million dollar lawsuit against David Krikorian. === Illegal Gifts from Turkish Coalition of America === In July 2011, the House Ethics Committee announced that it was investigating accusations that Schmidt had accepted roughly $500,000 in free legal services from a Turkish-American interest group (the Turkish Coalition of America). Schmidt said that she hadn't received a bill for the legal services in question, and that she had been waiting for more than a year for guidance from the ethics committee on the proper procedure to pay the bill. In August 2011, the Ethics Committee rendered its decision, holding that the interest group's payment for legal services in connection with her proceedings against Krikorian had been improper, and ordering Schmidt to repay the group $500,000. On September 21, 2011, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington added Schmidt to its \\"most corrupt\\" list for \\"accept[ing] hundreds of thousands of dollars in free legal services from lawyers hired by an interest group that appreciated her legislative assistance\\" as well as \\"fail[ure] to report the free legal services as gifts in her disclosure forms.\\" In October 2011, CREW requested that the Office of Congressional Ethics investigate whether Schmidt lied to the House Ethics Committee regarding inquiries into free legal services. == Legal expense fund == As part of the Ethics Committee ruling, Schmidt was given permission to establish a legal expense fund to help refund the illegal gifts from the Turkish Coalition of America. Through September 30, 2012—approximately one year after establishing the fund—Schmidt has raised a total of $5000 and made no payments from the legal expense fund to repay the illegal gifts. The sole contribution to the legal expense fund, $5000, came from a Turkish linked aviation firm, Global Eclipse, LLC. Schmidt left office on January 4 of 2013. Under House Rules, she was required to file one last financial disclosure statement by February 4. She failed to do so, but on March 1, 2013, she finally filed that form disclosing that she left Congress owing the Turkish Coalition of America a debt in the range between $515,000 and $1.05 million. == FEC investigation == In August 2011, David Krikorian filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that the illegal gifts received by Schmidt from the Turkish Coalition of America were also illegal campaign contributions. On January 13, 2015 the Federal Election Commission issued its findings; that the Turkish Coalition of America and its president, Lincoln McCurdy, had violated 52 U.S.C.§ 30118 a) and that the Schmidt for Congress Committee had violated 52 U.S.C. §§ 30118 a) and 30104 b) provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. On June 14, 2016, Schmidt's campaign committee entered into a conciliation agreement with the FEC, agreeing that the Turkish Coalition of America's payment of over $600,000 of her legal bills constituted an illegal campaign contribution and that her campaign had accepted illegal campaign contributions from the Turkish Coalition of America and had failed to report those contributions. Schmidt for Congress agreed to pay a nominal fine. The FEC accepted a nominal fine because \\"the Committee has plans to terminate, has very little cash, and has a limited ability to raise any additional funds.\\" The Turkish Coalition of America agreed to pay a $25,000 fine as a result of its illegal campaign contributions. == Personal life == Schmidt and her husband, Peter W. Schmidt have one child, a daughter, Emilie (born in 1978). A Roman Catholic, she has been a member of Elizabeth Ann Seton Church since 1978. She is a marathon runner. Schmidt is a member of the Clermont County Chamber of Commerce, the Clermont County 20/20 Committee, Clermont County League of Women Voters, the Clermont County Agricultural Society, Clermont County Township Association, and the Milford-Miami Township Chamber of Commerce. She was elected chairman of the Greater Cincinnati Right to Life organization in 2005.Cincinnati Right to Life newsletter April 2005. Retrieved October 26, 2007. Schmidt was a trustee of the Clermont County Library from 1980 to 1992 and 1994 to 2000. She was reappointed to the board in 2005. She is also a director of the Mercy Hospital Clermont Foundation Board. == See also == * Women in the United States House of Representatives == References  External links == * Jean Schmidt for Congress official campaign site * Profile on the Ohio Ladies' Gallery website * * 2000, 2002, 2004 Campaign contributions at the National Institute for Money in State Politics * * Advocacy group ratings at The Hill * Video of the \\"cowards cut and run\\" remark, from C-SPAN Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:American anti-abortion activists Category:Female members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio Category:Armenian Genocide deniers Category:Ohio Republicans Category:People from Loveland, Ohio Category:Politicians from Cincinnati Category:University of Cincinnati alumni Category:Women state legislators in Ohio Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Activists from Ohio Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Jean Schmidt"},{"id":"2001586","text":"Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute is a public secondary school in Kitchener, Ontario.

They are believed to be one of the first mixed- gender American punk band. The band included guitarist/singer Roni Lee (born Rhonda Lee Ryckman), who had co-written the song \\"I Wanna Be Where the Boys Are\\" for the Runaways; guitarist/singer Steven T.; bassist Danielle Faye (formerly of Atomic Kid); drummer Nickey Beat (formerly of The Weirdos and the Germs) (who was soon replaced by Kyle Raven); and singers Dyan Diamond and Vicki Razorblade (born Vicki Arnold). When the band formed, Diamond and Razorblade were only 14 and 17 years old respectively. Session musicians were used in some of the band's recordings. The Woman's International Music Network, founded by Laura B. Whitmore, gives credit to Venus and the Razorblades, as well as the Runaways, for performing in a genre that was dominated mostly by men. Venus and the Razorblades played a memorable concert with Van Halen at the Whisky a Go Go in 1976, and Van Halen sometimes played the Venus and the Razorblades song \\"Young and Wild\\" in their early concert performances. The band put out a novelty single called \\"Punk-A-Rama\\" on the independent label Bomp! Records to capitalize on the popularity of the punk rock genre, but then broke up. A compilation album called Songs from the Sunshine Jungle was released in 1978 on Visa Records; it is extremely rare today. After Venus and the Razorblades disbanded, Fowley tried to make Dyan Diamond into a star, and got a deal for her with MCA Records; her 1978 album, In the Dark was a commercial failure.. Roni Lee collaborated and performed with Randy California and Ed Cassidy of Spirit, as well as Mars Bonfire and Jerry Edmonton of Steppenwolf, in 1977-78. In 2013, Lee was granted an endorsement with Paul Reed Smith guitars for her distinctive style of playing as well as her place in punk rock's early history. Lee released the album Heros of Sunset Blvd. in 2016. ==ReferencesExternal links== *[ Allmusic] * Venus and the Razorblades Category:American new wave musical groups ","title":"Venus and the Razorblades"},{"id":"2001621","text":":Where appropriate, this article will use the abstract index notation. Solutions of the Einstein field equations are spacetimes that result from solving the Einstein field equations (EFE) of general relativity. Solving the field equations gives a Lorentz manifold. Solutions are broadly classed as exact or non-exact. The Einstein field equations are :G_{ab} + \\\\Lambda g_{ab} \\\\, = \\\\kappa T_{ab} , where G_{ab} is the Einstein tensor, \\\\Lambda is the cosmological constant (sometimes taken to be zero for simplicity), g_{ab} is the metric tensor, \\\\kappa is a constant, and T_{ab} is the stress–energy tensor. The Einstein field equations relate the Einstein tensor to the stress–energy tensor, which represents the distribution of energy, momentum and stress in the spacetime manifold. The Einstein tensor is built up from the metric tensor and its partial derivatives; thus, given the stress–energy tensor, the Einstein field equations are a system of ten partial differential equations in which the metric tensor can be solved for. ==Solving the equations== It is important to realize that the Einstein field equations alone are not enough to determine the evolution of a gravitational system in many cases. They depend on the stress–energy tensor, which depends on the dynamics of matter and energy (such as trajectories of moving particles), which in turn depends on the gravitational field. If one is only interested in the weak field limit of the theory, the dynamics of matter can be computed using special relativity methods and/or Newtonian laws of gravity and then the resulting stress–energy tensor can be plugged into the Einstein field equations. But if the exact solution is required or a solution describing strong fields, the evolution of the metric and the stress–energy tensor must be solved for together. To obtain solutions, the relevant equations are the above quoted EFE (in either form) plus the continuity equation (to determine evolution of the stress–energy tensor): :T^{ab}{}_{;b} \\\\, = 0 \\\\,. This is clearly not enough, as there are only 14 equations (10 from the field equations and 4 from the continuity equation) for 20 unknowns (10 metric components and 10 stress–energy tensor components). Equations of state are missing. In the most general case, it's easy to see that at least 6 more equations are required, possibly more if there are internal degrees of freedom (such as temperature) which may vary throughout space-time. In practice, it is usually possible to simplify the problem by replacing the full set of equations of state with a simple approximation. Some common approximations are: * Vacuum: :T_{ab} \\\\, = 0 * Perfect fluid: :T_{ab} \\\\, = (\\\\rho + p)u_a u_b + p g_{ab} where u^au_a = -1\\\\\\\\! Here \\\\rho is the mass-energy density measured in a momentary co-moving frame, u_a is the fluid's 4-velocity vector field, and p is the pressure. * Non-interacting dust ( a special case of perfect fluid ): :T_{ab} \\\\, = \\\\rho u_a u_b For a perfect fluid, another equation of state relating density \\\\rho and pressure p must be added. This equation will often depend on temperature, so a heat transfer equation is required or the postulate that heat transfer can be neglected. Next, notice that only 10 of the original 14 equations are independent, because the continuity equation T^{ab}{}_{;b} = 0 is a consequence of Einstein's equations. This reflects the fact that the system is gauge invariant (in general, absent some symmetry, any choice of a curvilinear coordinate net on the same system would correspond to a numerically different solution.) A \\"gauge fixing\\" is needed, i.e. we need to impose 4 (arbitrary) constraints on the coordinate system in order to obtain unequivocal results. These constraints are known as coordinate conditions. A popular choice of gauge is the so-called \\"De Donder gauge\\", also known as the harmonic condition or harmonic gauge :g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\Gamma^{\\\\sigma}_{\\\\mu u} = 0 \\\\,. In numerical relativity, the preferred gauge is the so-called \\"3+1 decomposition\\", based on the ADM formalism. In this decomposition, metric is written in the form : ds^2 \\\\, = (-N + N^i N^j \\\\gamma_{ij}) dt^2 + 2N^i \\\\gamma_{ij} dt dx^j + \\\\gamma_{ij} dx^i dx^j, where i,j = 1\\\\dots 3 \\\\,. N and N^i are functions of spacetime coordinates and can be chosen arbitrarily in each point. The remaining physical degrees of freedom are contained in \\\\gamma_{ij}, which represents the Riemannian metric on 3-hypersurfaces t=const. For example, a naive choice of N=1, N_i=0, would correspond to a so- called synchronous coordinate system: one where t-coordinate coincides with proper time for any comoving observer (particle that moves along a fixed x^i trajectory.) Once equations of state are chosen and the gauge is fixed, the complete set of equations can be solved for. Unfortunately, even in the simplest case of gravitational field in the vacuum ( vanishing stress–energy tensor ), the problem turns out too complex to be exactly solvable. To get physical results, we can either turn to numerical methods; try to find exact solutions by imposing symmetries; or try middle-ground approaches such as perturbation methods or linear approximations of the Einstein tensor. ==Exact solutions== Exact solutions are Lorentz metrics that are conformable to a physically realistic stress–energy tensor and which are obtained by solving the EFE exactly in closed form. ===External reference=== Scholarpedia article on the subject written by Malcolm MacCallum ==Non-exact solutions== Those solutions that are not exact are called non-exact solutions. Such solutions mainly arise due to the difficulty of solving the EFE in closed form and often take the form of approximations to ideal systems. Many non-exact solutions may be devoid of physical content, but serve as useful counterexamples to theoretical conjectures. Al Momin argues that Kurt Gödel's solution to these equations do not describe our universe and are therefore approximations. ==Applications== There are practical as well as theoretical reasons for studying solutions of the Einstein field equations. From a purely mathematical viewpoint, it is interesting to know the set of solutions of the Einstein field equations. Some of these solutions are parametrised by one or more parameters. ==See also== *Ricci calculus ==References== * * * Category:General relativity Category:Albert Einstein ","title":"Solutions of the Einstein field equations"},{"id":"2001636","text":"Prothesis may refer to: * Liturgy of Preparation, also known as Prothesis * Prothesis (altar) * Prothesis (linguistics) * A form of the custom of lying in repose in Ancient Greece; see Ancient Greek funeral and burial practices ==See also== *Prosthesis (disambiguation) ","title":"Prothesis"},{"id":"2001641","text":"La folie is the sixth studio album by English new wave band The Stranglers. It was released on 9 November 1981, through record label Liberty; their first album on the label. ==Background== The Stranglers had initially been the most commercially successful band of the punk/new wave period in Britain, but by 1981, their success had waned noticeably. La folie was a conscious attempt to deliver a more commercial product. The band's record company, EMI, sent them into the studio with the record producer, Tony Visconti, giving him a brief to \\"produce each song as if it was a hit single\\". The album's French language title literally translates to \\"madness\\". In various interviews, the band related that this referred to \\"The Madness of Love\\" and that conceptually, each of the songs on the album was intended to explore a different kind or aspect of \\"love\\". The title track is also said to be based upon the story of Issei Sagawa. Hugh Cornwell related in The Stranglers – Song by Song that the correct title of the album's opening track was \\"Non Stop Nun\\", and he apparently had been unaware that the record company had printed it as simply \\"Non Stop\\". There has been much controversy surrounding the lyrics to \\"Golden Brown\\". In his 2001 book The Stranglers Song By Song, Hugh Cornwell states \\"'Golden Brown' works on two levels. It's about heroin and also about a girl\\". Essentially, the lyrics describe how \\"both provided me with pleasurable times\\". ==Track listingRelease== La folie was preceded by the release of the album's first single, \\"Let Me Introduce You to the Family\\", released on 2 November 1981 and reaching No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart. La folie was released seven days later. Upon its release, La folie looked set to be the band's lowest-charting album, but, buoyed by the success of the album's second single, \\"Golden Brown\\", released 10 January 1982 and reaching No. 2 in the singles chart, the album eventually peaked at No. 11 in the UK Albums Chart, spending eighteen weeks in the chart. The single would go on to become EMI's highest-selling single for many years. One more single was released from the album, the album's title track \\"La folie\\", on 20 April 1982, which reached No. 47. ==Critical reception== Trouser Press wrote of the album: \\"Subtle, effective, mature and energetic – but no outstanding songs.\\" ==Personnel== ;The Stranglers * Hugh Cornwell - guitar, lead and backing vocals * Dave Greenfield - keyboards, backing vocals * Jean-Jacques Burnel - bass, backing and lead vocals * Jet Black - drums, percussion http://www.discogs.com/Stranglers-La-Folie/release/5444998 ;Technical *Steve Churchyard - engineer *Tony Visconti - mixing *Jay Pee - art direction *The Stranglers - cover concept *Phil Jude - front cover photography ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:The Stranglers albums Category:1981 albums ","title":"La folie (album)"},{"id":"2001645","text":"The Quick were a mid-1970s power pop band based in Los Angeles. The Quick were influenced by 1960s British Invasion bands and 1970s British glam bands, as well as by fellow Angelenos Sparks (formerly Halfnelson). Over the course of its three-year existence, the band rapidly evolved a sound of its own and towards the last year became noteworthy for cleverly arranged vocal harmonies and blistering guitar solos frequently inspired by 1950s American rock & roll bands. During the band's three-year career, The Quick helped shape the face of punk rock in California. ==History== In Los Angeles, between the glam and punk eras in the mid-1970s, there were few clubs for local bands to play original music. However, in early 1976 The Quick began playing at the Starwood and on Thanksgiving Weekend 1976 revived the Whisky A Go Go. During its career, The Quick played various club shows supporting such bands as Van Halen, Ramones, The Runaways, and Crack The Sky, in addition to headlining slots. The Quick's most-attended show was an opening slot for Starz at the 3,000-seat Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in 1977. The Quick released a full-length album, 1976's Mondo Deco on Mercury Records, produced by Kim Fowley and engineered by Earle Mankey, the original guitarist of Sparks (formerly Halfnelson), one of the band's earlier influences. In 2003, various demo recordings were included on the 2003 rarities compilation Untold Rock Stories on Rev-Ola Records in the UK. In March 1978, the band recorded singles produced by established Elektra Records staff arranger David Campbell. Referred to as The Elektra singles, (though the band never signed with Elektra Records) the songs displayed a shift in the band's early proto-punk/punk sound to a more experimental harder- rock approach. A few of the songs were released on 10\\" and 7\\" limited edition vinyl via the band's fan club, and all nine tracks were eventually released on Untold Rock Stories. One of those tracks, \\"Pretty Please Me\\", was played frequently by local KROQ-FM DJ Rodney Bingenheimer on his weekly \\"Rodney On the ROQ\\" radio show in 1978, but there were no records available to sell. The song was later covered and officially released by both Redd Kross and The Dickies. In April 1978, the band invited fans to attend its 3rd anniversary show (and vote on the set list) at its Hollywood rehearsal space. It was The Quick's final show, as the group disbanded shortly afterwards. The Quick have an intertwined history with long running punk rock band the Dickies. Steve Huffsteter, who went to school with Dickies vocalist Leonard Graves Phillips, gave guitar lessons to Dickies axeman Stan Lee. Huffsteter both introduced those two principals to one another, and encouraged their punk rock direction. Members of the Quick, who were dominated in terms of songwriting credits for their own band by Huffsteter, contributed to the Dickies' early canon. The Dickies, perhaps returning a favor, would go on to cover \\"pretty please me\\" on Stukas Over Disneyland (1983). ==Band members== * Danny Wilde – lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist * Steven Hufsteter – lead guitarist, primary songwriter * Billy Bizeau – keyboardist, backing vocalist * Ian Ainsworth – bassist, backing vocalist * Danny Benair – drummer Most of The Quick's material was written by guitarist Steven Hufsteter (who would later become a founding member of The Cruzados). He played in Tito & Tarantula with fellow former Cruzado member Tito Larriva. Lead vocalist Danny Wilde and bassist Ian (Grey) Ainsworth formed Great Buildings and released one LP on Columbia Records. Wilde later partnered with Phil Solem as The Rembrandts. They found success with their recording of the Michael Skloff/Allee Willis-co-written song \\"I'll Be There For You,\\" which was used as the theme song for the TV show Friends Keyboardist Billy Bizeau would go on to collaborate on writing songs with Kim Fowley (the band's initial manager) for The Runaways. Drummer Danny Benair played with several other Los Angeles bands, including Flyboys, Choir Invisible, The Falcons, The Weirdos, and The Three O'Clock (formerly Salvation Army) before switching to the behind-the-scenes licensing business and founding a film soundtrack song placement agency, Natural Energy Lab. One of their early songs, \\"Guardian Angel\\", appeared in 1978 on Rhino Records' Saturday Night Pogo new wave compilation LP. To avoid contractual issues, this early recording was credited to \\"The Young Republicans\\". Producer David Campbell is the father of noted alternative musician Beck Hansen. Benair's girlfriend during much of his tenure in The Quick was Lisa Fancher, who wrote liner notes for The Runaways' debut album, then went on to found the influential independent record label Frontier Records. ==Discography== *Saturday Night Pogo – A Collection of Los Angeles New Wave Bands, Rhino Records RNLP 003 USA 1978+ *Mondo Deco, Mercury Records, USA, 1976 (vinyl LP only) *Untold Rock Stories, Rev-Ola Records CR-REV-30, UK, 2003, 22 tracks (CD only) UPC: 5013929433021 *\\"Pretty Please\\" on D.I.Y.: We're Desperate: The L.A.

It retailed for $129 for the desktop version and $499 for Server. Leopard was superseded by Snow Leopard (version 10.6). Leopard is the final version of macOS to support the PowerPC architecture as Snow Leopard functions solely on Intel based Macs. According to Apple, Leopard contains over 300 changes and enhancements over its predecessor, Mac OS X Tiger, covering core operating system components as well as included applications and developer tools. Leopard introduces a significantly revised desktop, with a redesigned Dock, Stacks, a semitransparent menu bar, and an updated Finder that incorporates the Cover Flow visual navigation interface first seen in iTunes. Other notable features include support for writing 64-bit graphical user interface applications, an automated backup utility called Time Machine, support for Spotlight searches across multiple machines, and the inclusion of Front Row and Photo Booth, which were previously included with only some Mac models. Apple missed Leopard's release time frame as originally announced by Apple's CEO Steve Jobs. When first discussed in June 2005, Jobs had stated that Apple intended to release Leopard at the end of 2006 or early 2007. A year later, this was amended to Spring 2007; however on April 12, 2007, Apple issued a statement that its release would be delayed until October 2007 because of the development of the iPhone. ==New and changed featuresEnd-user features=== Apple advertised that Mac OS X Leopard has 300+ new features, including: *A new and improved Automator, with easy starting points to easily start a workflow.

Now it can use a new action called \\"Watch Me Do\\" that lets you record a user action (like pressing a button or controlling an application without built-in Automator support) and replay as an action in a workflow. It can create more useful Automator workflows with actions for RSS feeds, iSight camera video snapshots, PDF manipulation, and much more. *Back to My Mac, a feature for MobileMe users that allows users to access files on their home computer while away from home via the internet. * Boot Camp, a software assistant allowing for the installation of other operating systems, such as Windows XP (SP2 or later) or Windows Vista, on a separate partition (or separate internal drive) on Intel-based Macs. *Dashboard enhancements, including Web Clip, a feature that allows users to turn a part of any Web page displayed in Safari into a live Dashboard widget, and Dashcode to help developers code widgets. *New Desktop, comprises a redesigned 3-D dock with a new grouping feature called Stacks, which displays files in either a \\"fan\\" style, \\"grid\\" style, or (since 10.5.2) a \\"list\\" style. Rory Prior, on the ThinkMac blog, criticized the shelf-like Dock along with a number of other changes to the user interface. *Dictionary can now search Wikipedia, and a dictionary of Apple terminology as well. Also included is the Japanese- language dictionary Daijisen, Progressive E-J and Progressive J-E dictionaries, and the 25,000-word thesaurus , all of which are provided by the Japanese publisher Shogakukan. *A redesigned Finder, with features similar to those seen in iTunes 7, including Cover Flow and a Source list-like sidebar. *Front Row has been reworked to closely resemble the interface of the original Apple TV. * iCal calendar sharing and group scheduling as well as syncing event invitations from Mail. The icon also reflects the current date even when the application is not running. In previous versions of Mac OS X, the icon would show July 17 in the icon any time the application was not running but the current date when the application was running. *iChat enhancements, including multiple logins, invisibility, animated icons, and tabbed chats, similar to features present in Pidgin, Adium and the iChat plugin Chax; iChat Theater, allowing users to incorporate images from iPhoto, presentations from Keynote, videos from QuickTime, and other Quick Look features into video chats; and Backdrops, which are similar to chroma keys, but use a real-time difference matte technique which does not require a green or blue screen. iChat also implements screen sharing, a feature previously available with Apple Remote Desktop. *Mail enhancements including the additions of RSS feeds, Stationery, Notes, and to-dos. To-dos use a system-wide service that is available to all applications. *Network file sharing improvements include more granular control over permissions, consolidation of AFP, FTP and SMB sharing into one control panel, and the ability to share individual folders, a feature that had not been available since Mac OS 9. * Parental controls now include the ability to place restrictions on use of the Internet and to set parental controls from anywhere using remote setup. *Photo Booth enhancements, including video recording with real-time filters and blue/green-screen technology. *Podcast Capture, an application allowing users to record and distribute podcasts. It requires access to a computer running Mac OS X Server with Podcast Producer. *Preview adds support for annotation, graphics, extraction, search, markup, Instant Alpha and size adjustment tools. *Quick Look, a framework allowing documents to be viewed without opening them in an external application and can preview it in full screen. Plug-ins are available for Quick Look so that you can also view other files, such as Installer Packages. Cover Flow View and viewing a file using Quick Look *Safari 3, which includes Web Clip. *Spaces, an implementation of virtual desktops (individually called \\"Spaces\\"), allows multiple desktops per user, with certain applications and windows in each desktop. Users can organize certain Spaces for certain applications (e.g., one for work-related tasks and one for entertainment) and switch between them. Exposé works inside Spaces, allowing the user to see at a glance all desktops on one screen.) Users can create and control up to 16 spaces, and applications can be switched between each one, creating a very large workspace. The auto-switching feature in Spaces has annoyed some of its users. Apple added a new preference in 10.5.2 which disabled this feature, but there were still bugs found while switching windows. In 10.5.3, this problem was addressed and was no longer an issue. *Spotlight incorporates additional search capabilities such as Boolean operators, as well as the ability to search other computers (with appropriate permissions). *Time Machine, an automated backup utility which allows the user to restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file. Though generally lauded in the press as a step forward for data recovery, Time Machine has been criticized in multiple publications for lacking the capabilities of third-party backup software. Analyzing the feature for TidBITS, Joe Kissell pointed out that Time Machine does not create bootable copies of backed-up volumes, does not back up to AirPort Disk hard drives and will not back up FileVault encrypted home directories until the user logs out, concluding that the feature is \\"pretty good at what it does\\" but he will only use it as part of a \\"broader backup strategy\\". One of these issues has been resolved, however; On March 19, 2008, updates were released for AirPort and Time Machine, allowing for Time Machine to use a USB hard disk which has been connected to an AirPort Extreme Base Station. *Universal Access enhancements: significant improvements to applications including VoiceOver, along with increased support for Braille, closed captioning and a new high‐quality Speech synthesis voice. *Many changes to the user interface, such as a transparent menu bar, new icons, and a 3D Dock. As well as this, the Apple icon is now black instead of blue. R.L. Prior, on the ThinkMac blog, criticized a number of changes to Leopard's user interface, including the transparent menu bar and the new folder icons. Decreased transparency of the menu bar, along with the ability to disable the menu bar transparency were added with the 10.5.2 release on February 11, 2008. * Russian language support, bringing the total to 18 languages. * Leopard removes support for Classic applications. * Introduced the Alex voice to VoiceOver. According to Apple, it is the most natural and understandable voice yet. ===Developer technologies=== * Native support by many libraries and frameworks for 64-bit applications, allowing 64-bit Cocoa applications. Existing 32-bit applications using those libraries and frameworks should continue to run without the need for emulation or translation. * Leopard offers the Objective-C 2.0 runtime, which includes new features such as garbage collection. Xcode 3.0 supports the updated language and was itself rewritten with it. * A new framework, Core Animation, allows a developer to create complex animations while specifying only a \\"start\\" and a \\"goal\\" space. The main goal of Core Animation is to enable the creation of complex animations with small amounts of program code. * Apple integrates DTrace from the OpenSolaris project and adds a graphical interface called Instruments (previously Xray). DTrace provides tools that users, administrators and developers can use to tune the performance of the operating system and the applications that run on it. * The new Scripting Bridge allows programmers to use Python and Ruby to interface with the Cocoa frameworks. * Ruby on Rails is included in the default install. * Leopard’s OpenGL stack has been updated to version 2.1, and uses LLVM to increase its vertex processing speed. Apple has been working to get LLVM integrated into GCC; LLVM’s use within other operating system facilities has not been announced. * The Graphics and Media State of the Union address confirmed many other features are possible because of Core Animation, such as live desktops, improvements to Quartz Composer with custom patches, a new PDF Kit for developers, and improvements to QuickTime APIs. * The \`FSEvents\` framework allows applications to register for notifications of changes to a given directory tree. * Leopard includes a read-only implementation of the ZFS file system. ::In mid-December 2006, a pre-release version of Leopard appeared to include support for Sun’s ZFS. Jonathan Schwartz, CEO and President of Sun Microsystems, boasted on June 6, 2007, that ZFS had become \\"the file system\\" for Leopard. However, the senior project marketing director for Mac OS X stated on June 11, 2007, that the existing HFS+, not ZFS, would be used in Leopard. Apple later clarified that a read-only version of ZFS would be included. * Leopard includes drivers for UDF 2.5, necessary for reading HD DVD and Blu-ray discs using third-party drives, but the included DVD Player software can only play HD DVDs authored by DVD Studio Pro. * Leopard includes a framework implementing latent semantic mapping for classifying (e.g. textual) data. * Leopard is the first operating system with open source BSD code to be certified as fully UNIX-compliant. Certification means that software following the Single UNIX Specification can be compiled and run on Leopard without the need for any code modification. The certification only applies to Leopard when run on Intel processors. * Leopard includes J2SE 5.0. ===Security enhancements=== New security features intend to provide better internal resiliency to successful attacks, in addition to preventing attacks from being successful in the first place. ; Library Randomization: Leopard implements library randomization, which randomizes the locations of some libraries in memory. Vulnerabilities that corrupt program memory often rely on known addresses for these library routines, which allow injected code to launch processes or change files. Library randomization is presumably a stepping-stone to a more complete implementation of address space layout randomization at a later date. ; Application Layer Firewall : Leopard ships with two firewall engines: the original BSD IPFW, which was present in earlier releases of Mac OS X, and the new Leopard Application Layer Firewall. Unlike IPFW, which intercepts and filters IP datagrams before the kernel performs significant processing, the Application Layer Firewall operates at the socket layer, bound to individual processes. The Application Layer Firewall can therefore make filtering decisions on a per-application basis. Of the two firewall engines, only the Application Layer Firewall is fully exposed in the Leopard user interface. The new firewall offers less control over individual packet decisions (users can decide to allow or deny connections system-wide or to individual applications, but must use IPFW to set fine-grained TCP/IP header-level policies). It also makes several policy exceptions for system processes: neither mDNSResponder nor programs running with superuser privileges are filtered. ; Sandboxes: Leopard includes kernel-level support for role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC is intended to prevent, for example, an application like Mail from editing the password database. ; Application Signing: Leopard provides a framework to use public key signatures for code signing to verify, in some circumstances, that code has not been tampered with. Signatures can also be used to ensure that one program replacing another is truly an \\"update\\", and carry any special security privileges across to the new version. This reduces the number of user security prompts, and the likelihood of the user being trained to simply clicking \\"OK\\" to everything. ; Secure Guest Account: Guests can be given access to a Leopard system with an account that the system erases and resets at logout. Security features in Leopard have been criticized as weak or ineffective, with the publisher Heise Security documenting that the Leopard installer downgraded firewall protection and exposed services to attack even when the firewall was re-enabled. Several researchers noted that the Library Randomization feature added to Leopard was ineffective compared to mature implementations on other platforms, and that the new \\"secure Guest account\\" could be abused by Guests to retain access to the system even after the Leopard log out process erased their home directory. ==System requirements== Apple states the following basic Leopard system requirements, although, for some specific applications and features (such as iChat backdrops) an Intel processor is required: * Processor: any Intel processor, or PowerPC G5 or G4 (867 MHz and faster) processor * Optical drive: internal or external DVD drive (for installation of the operating system) * Memory: minimum 512 MB of RAM (additional RAM (1 GB) is recommended for development purposes) * Hard drive capacity: Minimum 9 GB of disk space available. Leopard’s retail version was not released in separate versions for each type of processor, but instead consisted of one universal release that could run on both PowerPC and Intel processors. However, the install discs that ship with Intel-based Macs only contain Intel binaries. Processor type and speed are checked during installation and installation halted if insufficient; however, Leopard will run on slower G4 processor machines (e.g., a 733 MHz Quicksilver) if the installation is performed on a supported Mac and its hard drive then moved to a slower/unsupported one (the drive may either be an internal mechanism or a Firewire external). ===Supported machines=== Leopard can run on the later flat-panel iMac G4s, the iMac G5, iMac Intel Core Duo and iMac Intel Core 2 Duo, PowerBook G4, Power Mac G4, Power Mac G5, iBook G4, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Xserve, Xserve G5, Xserve RAID, Macintosh Server G4, and later eMac models. Leopard can run on older hardware as long as they have a G4 upgrade installed running at the 867 MHz or faster, have at least 9 GB free of hard drive space, 512 MB RAM and have a DVD drive. Leopard however will not run on the 900 MHz iBook G3 models even though they exceed the minimum 867 MHz requirement. This is due to the lack of AltiVec support in the G3 line of processors. Leopard can be \\"hacked\\" (see below) to install on these G3 and pre-867 MHz G4 machines but the system may behave erratically and many of the programs, features, and functions may not work properly or at all. As of mid-2010, some Apple computers have firmware factory installed which will no longer allow installation of Mac OS X Leopard. These computers only allow installation of Mac OS X Snow Leopard. However, some computers (such as the 2011 model of the Mac mini) can have Leopard installed on them without hacking. ===Usage on unsupported hardware=== Some ways of running Leopard on certain unsupported hardware, primarily PowerPC G4 computers with CPU speeds lower than the official requirement of 867 MHz, have been discovered. A common way is use of the program LeopardAssist, which is a bootloader similar in some respects to XPostFacto (used for installing earlier releases of Mac OS X on unsupported G3 and pre-G3 Macs) that uses the Mac’s Open Firmware to tell Leopard that the machine does have a CPU meeting the 867 MHz minimum requirement that the Installer checks for before installation is allowed to commence, when in reality the CPU is slower.LeopardAssist — Install Leopard on Sub-867MHz[sic Macs] Currently, LeopardAssist only runs on slower G4s and many people have installed Leopard successfully on these older machines. Users who have access to supported hardware have installed Leopard on the supported machine then simply moved the hard drive to the unsupported machine. Alternatively, the Leopard Installation DVD was booted on a supported Mac, then installed on an unsupported Mac via Firewire Target Disk Mode. Leopard is only compiled for AltiVec-enabled PowerPC processors (G4 and G5) though, as well as Intel, so both of these methods will only work on Macs with G4 or later CPUs. While some of the earlier beta releases were made to run on some later G3 machines (mostly later 800–900 MHz iBooks), no success with the retail version has been officially reported on G3 Macs except for some later iMacs and \\"Pismo\\" PowerBook G3s with G4 processor upgrades installed. For a number of months after Leopard's release it appeared that the only G3 Macs on which Leopard could be run were those with both an aftermarket G4 processor and an AGP graphics card, as failures with the OS partially booting before crashing were reported on older Macs such as the original tray-loading iMacs and the Beige and Blue & White Power Mac G3 (all with G4 upgrades as Leopard will not even begin to load without one) whereas it would boot fine on newer Macs where the Installer restriction had been circumvented. However, more recently it has been reported that with some more work and use of kernel extensions from XPostFacto, Tiger and beta builds of Leopard, the OS can be made to run on G4-upgraded Macs as old as the Power Macintosh 9500, despite the lack of AGP-based graphics. While Leopard can be run on any Mac with a G4 or later processor, some functionality such as Front Row or Time Machine fails to work without a Quartz Extreme-capable graphics card, which many of the earlier G4s did not include in their factory specification. Since Apple moved to using Intel processors in their computers, the OSx86 community has developed and now also allows Mac OS X Tiger and later releases to be installed and run successfully on non-Apple x86-based computers, albeit in violation of Apple's licensing agreement for Mac OS X. ==Packaging== The retail packaging for Leopard is significantly smaller than that of previous versions of Mac OS X (although later copies of Tiger also came in the new smaller box). It also includes a lenticular cover, making the X appear to float above a purple galaxy, somewhat resembling the default Leopard desktop wallpaper. ==Release history== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- | style=\\"background:#f08080;\\"| | Unsupported |} {|class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !|Version !|Build ! style=\\"width: 128px;\\" |Date ! style=\\"width: 68px;\\" |OS name !|Notes !|Download |- ! style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5 ||9A581 ||October 26, 2007 ||Darwin 9.0 ||Original retail DVD release | |- ! style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.1 ||9B18 ||November 15, 2007 ||Darwin 9.1 ||About the Mac OS X 10.5.1 Update; Second retail DVD release ||Mac OS X 10.5.1 Update |- !rowspan=2 style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.2 ||9C31 |rowspan=2|February 11, 2008 |rowspan=2|Darwin 9.2 |rowspan=2|About the Mac OS X 10.5.2 Update |rowspan=2|Mac OS X 10.5.2 Combo Update |- ||9C7010 |- ! style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.3 ||9D34 ||May 28, 2008 ||Darwin 9.3 ||About the Mac OS X 10.5.3 Update ||Mac OS X 10.5.3 Update Mac OS X 10.5.3 Combo Update |- ! style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.4 ||9E17 ||June 30, 2008 ||Darwin 9.4 ||About the Mac OS X 10.5.4 update; Third retail DVD release ||Mac OS X 10.5.4 Update Mac OS X 10.5.4 Combo Update |- ! style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.5 ||9F33 ||September 15, 2008 ||Darwin 9.5 ||About the Mac OS X 10.5.5 Update ||Mac OS X 10.5.5 Update Mac OS X 10.5.5 Combo Update |- !rowspan=2 style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.6 ||9G55 ||December 15, 2008 |rowspan=2 |Darwin 9.6 ||About the Mac OS X 10.5.6 Update ||Mac OS X 10.5.6 Update Mac OS X 10.5.6 Combo Update |- ||9G66 ||January 6, 2009 ||Fourth retail DVD release (part of Mac Box Set) | |- ! style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.7 ||9J61 ||May 12, 2009 ||Darwin 9.7 ||About the Mac OS X 10.5.7 Update ||Mac OS X 10.5.7 Update Mac OS X 10.5.7 Combo Update |- ! style=\\"background:#f08080;\\" | 10.5.8 ||9L30 ||August 5, 2009 ||Darwin 9.8 ||About the Mac OS X 10.5.8 Update ||Mac OS X 10.5.8 Update Mac OS X 10.5.8 Combo Update |} ==Compatibility== After Leopard’s release, there were widely reported incidents of new Leopard installs hanging during boot on the blue screen that appears just before the login process starts. Apple attributed these problems to an outdated version of an unsupported add-on extension called Application Enhancer (APE), from Unsanity which had been incompatible with Leopard. Some users were unaware that APE had been silently installed during installation of Logitech mouse drivers. However, only the users who did not have the latest version of APE installed (2.0.3 at that time) were affected. Apple published a knowledge base article on how to solve this problem. Google announced that the Chrome browser will be dropping support for Leopard starting with Chrome 21. By that time Chrome will no longer auto-update, and new Chrome installations are not allowed. Their rationale for removal of support is that Leopard is an \\"OS X version also no longer being updated by Apple.\\" Firefox also dropped support for Leopard after it shipped Firefox 16 in October 2012. TenFourFox is a port of Firefox for the PPC architecture, released after Firefox dropped support for Leopard. ==ReferencesExternal links== * 2006 WWDC keynote presentation at Apple.com * 2007 WWDC keynote presentation at Apple.com * Mac OS X Leopard review at Ars Technica 5 Category:IA-32 operating systems Category:X86-64 operating systems Category:PowerPC operating systems Category:2007 software Category:Computer-related introductions in 2007 ","title":"Mac OS X Leopard"},{"id":"2001673","text":"The NWA National Tag Team Championship was the major tag team title in the NWA-affiliated Georgia Championship Wrestling from 1980 until 1986. The championship was introduced in November 1980 when Georgia Tag Team Champions The Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes, Buddy Roberts, and Terry Gordy) won a tournament to determine the first champions, defeating Stan Frazier and Robert Fuller in the final. They were introduced as the Georgia and National Tag Team Champions and carried a trophy to the ring representing the National title as they wore belts which represented the Georgia title. The National Tag Team Championship continued to be represented by a trophy until Thanksgiving Night in 1981, when the promotion awarded newly made belts (modeled after the old Georgia tag team belts, which the National title replaced) to the winners of its annual turkey night tag team tournament. The father and son duo of Bob and Brad Armstrong defeated Mr. Fuji and Mr. Saito in the final to win the vacant NWA National Tag Team Championship. When World Wrestling Entertainment (then called the World Wrestling Federation)'s Vince McMahon bought Georgia Championship Wrestling, Inc.'s TV timeslot (after GCW's contract with TBS expired without renewal: Black Saturday), the titleholders were Ron Garvin and Jerry Oates. After Oates and Garvin refused to sign with McMahon, McMahon discontinued the title. A new wrestling promotion -- containing some former Georgia Championship Wrestling personnel -- Championship Wrestling from Georgia reactivated the title, and recognized Garvin & Oates as the titleholders, keeping the Georgia Championship Wrestling lineage unbroken. Jim Crockett Promotions bought the TBS wrestling timeslot from the WWF in 1985 -- and Championship Wrestling from Georgia (including CWG's Saturday morning TBS timeslot, as well) -- kept the title active. The title was written out of JCP storylines when titleholders Ole Anderson & Arn Anderson were stripped of the belts, and JCP replaced them by establishing its 'new' United States Tag Team Championship, and a tournament to crown its 'first' champions. ==Title historySee also== *National Wrestling Alliance *Jim Crockett Promotions ==References== Category:Georgia Championship Wrestling championships Category:Jim Crockett Promotions championships Category:National Wrestling Alliance championships Category:Regional professional wrestling championships ","title":"NWA National Tag Team Championship"},{"id":"2001686","text":"Abd al-Muttalib (; c.497–578) was the grandfather of Muhammad.

Saengseon-hoe () can be either hwareo-hoe () made from freshly killed fish, or seoneo-hoe () made using aged fish. Mulhoe () is a cold raw fish soup. === Blanched === Sukhoe () is a blanched fish, seafood, meat, or vegetable dish. Ganghoe () is a dish of rolled and tied ribbons made with blanched vegetables such as water dropworts and scallions. == Preparation == Hwareo-hoe () is prepared by filleting freshly killed fish, while seoneo-hoe () is made with aged fish in a similar way as Japanese sashimi: removing the blood and innards and ageing the fish at a certain temperature before filleting. Fish or seafood hoe is often served with gochujang-based dipping sauces, such as cho-gochujang (chili paste mixed with vinegar) and ssamjang (chili paste mixed with soybean paste). Hoe is often eaten wrapped in ssam (wrap) vegetables, such as lettuce and perilla leaves. After eating hoe at a restaurant, maeun-tang (spicy fish stew) made with the bones, head, and the remaining meat of the fish, can be served as an add-on dish. ==History== Gangbyeon hoeeum () drawn by Kim Deuk-sin (1754‒1822) depicts Korean people gathered to eat saengseon-hoe (raw fish dish) after fishing. With the popularization of Buddhism in Korea, beginning in the middle of the Three Kingdoms period, and running late into the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392), the consumption of fish and other meat products (including hoe) declined. As the influence of Buddhism waned in the late Goryeo Dynasty period, the consumption of hoe began to lose its stigma. During the Joseon Dynasty, the state promoted Confucianism, and, as Confucius was known to have enjoyed eating raw meat, hoe consumption greatly increased. ==Gallery== File:Korean.cuisine-Hoe-01.jpg|Various hoe File:Bangeo-hoe.jpg|Bangeo-hoe (raw amberjack) File:Korean_sea_worm.jpg|Gaebul-hoe (raw fat innkeeper worm) File:Godeungeo-hoe.jpg|Godeungeo-hoe (raw chub mackerel) File:Galchi- hoe.jpg|Galchi-hoe (raw largehead hairtail) File:Korean.cuisine- Hoe-02.jpg|Gulhoe (raw oysters) File:Horaegi-hoe.jpg|Horaegi-hoe (raw loliolus squid) File:Jaridom-hoe.jpg|Jaridom-hoe (raw pearl-spot chromis) File:Korean cuisine-Muneohoe-01.jpg|Muneo-hoe (raw giant octopus) File:Ojingeo- hoe.jpg|Ojingeo-hoe (raw flying squid) File:Jeonbok-mulhoe 2.jpg|Jeonbok- mulhoe (cold raw abalone soup) File:Hoe-muchim.jpg|Hoe-muchim (seasoned hoe salad) File:Korean.food-Hoe.naengmyeon-01.jpg|Hoe-naengmyeon (cold noodles with hoe) File:Hoedeopbap (raw fish rice bowl).jpg|Hoe-deopbap (bibimbap with hoe) ==See also== *Hoedeopbap *Kuai (dish) *Maeuntang *Namasu *Sannakji *Yusheng ==ReferencesExternal links== *생선회의 역사와 정보 Category:Korean meat dishes Category:Korean seafood dishes Category:Korean vegetable dishes Category:Uncooked fish dishes Category:Uncooked meat dishes ","title":"Hoe (food)"},{"id":"2001694","text":"Skinners Pond, July 2017 Skinners Pond is a rural unincorporated community in Prince County, Prince Edward Island, Canada.

It is led by pipe major Alan Bevan and leading drummer J. Reid Maxwell. ==History== The Simon Fraser University Pipe Band was originally formed by a group of students at Simon Fraser University in 1966. Brothers Terry and Jack Lee joined the Simon Fraser University band in 1981 after being approached by then-president of the University George Pedersen through Scottish soccer coach John Buchanan, who wanted to have a better quality band than the one that would form as necessary for events. The next year, the band won the North American Championships, and in 1983 came 10th at the World Championships. In 1985, the band came second at the Worlds. J. Reid Maxwell joined the band as leading drummer in 1992, having previously been leading drummer of the 78th Fraser Highlanders Pipe Band when it became the first non-Scottish band to win the World Championships in 1987. After Robert Barbulak and Malcolm Bokenfor were killed in a road accident in 1994, the Robert Malcolm Memorial Pipe Band was created as a system of three bands in lower grades to act as a feeder to the Grade 1 band. The Robert Malcolm Memorial bands have also been successful in competitions in their respective grades. The band wears the Simon Fraser University tartan, which was custom designed for the band in 2010. On September 29, 2013, Terry Lee stepped down as Pipe Major after leading the band for over 30 years, having appointed Alan Bevan, a two-time solo Gold Medalist, as his successor. Jack continues to act as pipe sergeant. ==Personnel== Terry Lee was pipe major of the band between 1981 and 2013 Terry and Jack played in the City of Victoria Pipe Band, and then Terry led the now defunct Port Moody Pipe Band, before they joined the Simon Fraser University band in 1981. Steven McWhirter and Stuart Liddell, now leading drummer and pipe major respectively of Inveraray & District Pipe Band, played with Simon Fraser University for several years. ==Competition== The band at the Worlds in 2012 The band has consistently placed in the top three in world competition and has won the Grade One World Pipe Band Championships six times, in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2008, and 2009. SFUPB is one of only four bands located outside of the United Kingdom that have won a World Pipe Band Championship (the other three being the 78th Fraser Highlanders Pipe Band, the Victoria Police Pipe Band and the St. Laurence O'Toole Pipe Band). In addition, the band has placed second nine times. The band placed in the top three at the World Championships for 14 consecutive years up until 2012, with a fourth placing in 2013 and no placing in 2014. They are the second most successful pipe band from outside Scotland, after the Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band. SFUPB regularly competes in Highland Games competitions sanctioned by the British Columbia Pipers Association in the northwestern United States and southwestern British Columbia before traveling to Scotland in August for the World Pipe Band Championships. The band wears the Simon Fraser University Pipe Band tartan. Since 1994, the SFUPB has led an extensive family of pipe bands which each compete in their own grades. This organization is called the Robert Malcolm Memorial Pipe Band. ==Concerts and recordings== The band at the Lincoln Concert Center The band has produced twelve recordings, three concert/documentary videos, and appeared on four BBC Radio Scotland broadcasts. In April 2001 the band recorded a CD live at the Sydney Opera House in Australia. On February 20, 1998, the band performed in concert at Carnegie Hall, New York City. This concert marked the first time a pipe band has performed a concert at this prestigious venue. The debut performance was recorded and released in June 1998 as Simon Fraser University Pipe Band - Live at Carnegie Hall. In June 1996, the band released its first live album Alive in America, the first live, in concert recording in the United States of a pipe band. In May 2012, the band returned to New York and recorded its latest album Live from New York City at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. In August 2015, gave a concert called Nous Sommes Prets at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. ==Albums== * Live in Chilliwack (Live 2020) * Live From New York City (Live 2012) * Affirmation (Live 2009) * On Home Ground Volume 2 (Studio and Live 2006) * On Home Ground Volume 1 (Studio and Live 2005) * Down Under - Live at the Sydney Opera House (Live 2001) * At The Worlds (Compilation 2000) * Live at Carnegie Hall (Live 1998) * Alive In America (Live 1996) * Do Mo Chara Maith (\\"For My Good Friend\\") (Studio 1994) * The Silver Anniversary Tribute (Studio 1991) * A High Cut Above (Piping for Highland Dancing) (Studio 1991) * Nous Sommes Prêts (\\"We Are Ready\\") (Studio 1984) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Simon Fraser University Pipe Band *Robert Malcolm Memorial Pipe Band *World Championship winning medley 2008 (Youtube) *In concert in 2009 (Youtube) Category:Musical groups established in 1966 Category:Grade 1 pipe bands Pipe Band Category:World Pipe Band Championships winners Category:Canadian marching bands Category:College marching bands in Canada Category:1966 establishments in British Columbia ","title":"Simon Fraser University Pipe Band"},{"id":"2001734","text":"Steve Harvey's Big Time Challenge, also known as Steve Harvey's Big Time and Big Time, is a television variety show that aired on the WB Network from 2003 to 2005, hosted by Steve Harvey.

Three of his riders, Bernard Hinault, Laurent Fignon, and Lucien Van Impe, won the Tour de France. Another protégé of Guimard's, Greg LeMond, described him as \\"the best (coach) in the world\\" and \\"the best coach I ever had\\". He has been described by cycling journalist William Fotheringham as the greatest directeur sportif in the history of the Tour. == Riding career == Born in Bouguenais, Loire-Atlantique, Guimard rode as a junior, an amateur and a professional, on the road, track and in cyclo-cross.Interview de Cyrille Guimard : \\"la conjoncture actuelle impose un changement radical et novateur dans l'appréhension de notre sport.\\" http://velo101.com/actualite/default.asp?Id=16135&Section;=G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral He was national champion in all three forms: road in 1967 as an amateur, track sprint in 1970 and cyclo-cross in 1976. The riders ahead of him in the 1970 and 1971 professional road championshipsPaul Gutty and Yves Hézard were disqualified and the titles not given.Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme vol 2, p362, Nathan, France He said: \\"After those in front of me were disqualified for failing the drugs test, the federation never had the idea of giving me the titles.\\". Guimard was then president of the riders' union (see below) and the resentment that that created was why he was not named champion, he said, while others in the same position had been. Guimard was a sprinter who won nearly 100 races in eight seasons. He won stages of the Tour de France in 1970, 1972, 1973 and 1974 – four of them in 1972 – although he finished the race only twice. He came 62nd in 1970 and seventh in 1971, the only year in which he didn't win a stage. He wore the green jersey of leader of the points competition in 1972 and won the combativity award in the 1972. He also won the points competition of the Vuelta a España and the Six-Days of Grenoble in 1972. Guimard's most striking Tour de France was in 1972, when he wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification and matched Eddy Merckx in the mountains. Fighting to keep the lead on long climbs created pain in his knees, one of which he injured in 1969 in an accident with a car while he was training. Merckx won two stages in the Alps and Guimard the next. Merckx tried to dispose of him on a 28 km stage to Mont Revard but Guimard, instead of cracking, won by 10 cm as the Belgian raised his hands thinking he had won. Guimard was in second place and leading the points competition two days from the finish in Paris when he was forced to withdraw. Merckx gave his green points jersey to Guimard on the podium in Paris. There were concerns about Guimard's treatment during the race, and reports that he had to be carried to his bike each morning because he could no longer walk. The team official caring for him was Bernard Sainz, sentenced to three years in 2008 for doping athletes and practising as an unqualified doctor. Sainz was sentenced to be jailed for the first half of the sentence and to be released on probation for the rest. He produced no evidence of medical training at his trial. He wrote in his autobiography: :It was at the time of our collaboration that the first accusations of doping came. An absurd rumour with a life as long as the Loch Ness monster because I saw it reappear in the Journal du Dimanche on 30 April 2000! For 30 years, people have been saying that I pushed Cyrille beyond his limits and that his knees ended up cracking in the 1972 Tour de France because of my methods. As is often the case, people talk and write, claiming to know everything when they know nothing.Sainz, Bernard (2000) Les Stupéfiantes Révélations du Dr Mabuse, J. C. Lattès, France, p63 The two men met when Sainz was assistant manager of Gan, the team for which Guimard rode with Raymond Poulidor. Sainz was at Guimard's side throughout the 1972 Tour. In 1973, Guimard was caught in a drugs test at the end of the stage from Avignon to Montpellier. Knee pain ended Guimard's racing and he moved into team management. == Team management == Guimard at the 1993 Tour de France Guimard became a directeur sportif with the Gitane team, which included Bernard Hinault and Lucien Van Impe. It was run by the former national champion, Jean Stablinski. Guimard had just won the French cyclo-cross championship. He took over as main directeur sportif in 1976. Hinault was considering leaving the team but Guimard, who had ridden in the peloton with Hinault, convinced him to stay. Hinault said: \\"Stablinski was a manager of the old school: 'Race and we'll talk about it later.' He gave me no advice at all, though he was decent enough. I would have been more impressed if he'd stuck to his word and not had me racing every race on the calendar. I wasn't a machine and he expected too much of me. But for Guimard, I might have joined up with Raymond Poulidor of the Mercier team and we'd never have got on. There'd have been wars between us and I'd have been off again, trying all the teams one by one, and wasting a lot of time. If you want to devote yourself to racing, you must find the right conditions and be able to get on with your colleagues. With Guimard I knew that things would improve and that we could agree on a programme. Guimard and I had a perfect understanding and realised most of our ambitions, even if we were to fall out later.\\"Hinault, Bernard (1988), Bernard Hinault: Memories of the Peloton, Springfield, UK, It was as directeur sportif that Guimard forged his reputation. He ran Gitane-Campagnolo, Renault-Elf-Gitane, Système U-Gitane, Super U, Castorama, and Cofidis; riders under his direction included Van Impe, Hinault, Laurent Fignon, Greg LeMond, Charly Mottet and Marc Madiot. Seven times his riders won the Tour de France. Said Van Impe: > Cyrille was one of the best directeurs sportifs that I ever met. Without > him, I don't know if I would ever have won the Tour. Perhaps I would, but > his way of talking to riders really lifted us. There's no one better for re- > motivating a rider. As a manager, he always stayed a rider in the way he > thought. That makes all the difference. He always knew when to go after a > break or to let it go. And everything he predicted at the morning briefing > came true later in the race. On the other hand, the moment the race was over > he always wanted the last word... a real Breton! But Guimard is > Guimard.People from Brittany have a reputation for stubbornness.Cyrille > Guimard: le retour aux manettes, Vélo, France, 2007 In the Saint Lary Soulan stage of the 1976 Tour de France Van Impe was following Joop Zoetemelk, calculating that the Dutchman would exhaust himself. He ignored the urgings of team assistants to go on the attack and said that if Guimard wanted him to ride differently then he was to say so himself. Guimard drove up alongside Van Impe and shouted that he'd run him off the road with his car if Van Impe didn't attack. Van Impe attacked, caught the riders ahead, put almost half the field outside the time limit and beat Zoetemelk by three minutes. In doing so he won the Tour. Said Hinault: \\"With Guimard, you do not argue.\\" Hinault said Guimard insisted he plan his season and his career. \\"He had no intention of taking on too much too early. Just as you plan your tactics before each race, so you should have a career strategy, too, at least for the first three or four years.\\" Guimard told Hinault not to ride the Tour in 1977, even though he had won the Dauphiné Libéré and beaten the favourites for the Tour, Van Impe and Bernard Thévenet. Hinault rode in 1978 and won then and in four other years. In his autobiography, Hinault credited Guimard with an uncanny tactical sense that led to his greatest wins, including Liège–Bastogne–Liège of 1980. Guimard's personality led to disagreements with riders, notably with Hinault in the mid-1980s. Hinault did not enter the 1983 Tour de France due to a knee injury, and his teammate, Laurent Fignon, won the race. The following season Hinault left Guimard to ride for the new La Vie Claire team. Guimard had the previous year taken on a young American, Greg LeMond, whom he knew from his win in the world junior championship in 1979 and whose career he had followed. Negotiating a contract reported as setting new standards for what riders could expect to earn exhausted his fax machine, Guimard said. \\"Americans are the kings of paperwork.\\" Guimard was an ardent advocate of modern methods of rider preparation. LeMond described him as the first professional cycling coach to formally study physiology in order to apply it to rider training. He also took riders to the Equipe Renault Elf Formula One team's wind tunnel to perfect their positioning on the bike and maximise their aerodynamic efficiency. Guimard's wind tunnel work with Hinault led to the development of the Gitane Profil, the first bike to use teardrop- shaped tubes and handlebars, which Hinault claimed gained him one and a half seconds per mile in time trials, and he also experimented with internal cabling. His interest in aerodynamics also led to his teams introducing other innovations in bicycle design during the 1980s, including sloping bike frames and disc wheels. At the 1986 Tour de France, his rider Thierry Marie won the prologue by a quarter of a second with the aid of a \\"lower back rest\\" on his bicycle which functioned as an aileron to reduce aerodynamic drag, although the design was subsequently banned. Guimard was left without a team when Castorama dropped out of the sport at the end of 1995. He helped form the Cofidis team but left after a court case in 1997 in which he was accused of false accounting and of obtaining credit by false pretences.Guimard in court, Cycling, UK, 1 November 1997 Guimard had been one of the founding directors of Siclor, a company set up in 1996 with 2.8 million francs of state aid to make bicycle frames. It collapsed in January 1997 with debts of 4.5 million francs. A court sentenced Guimard to a suspended jail sentence for \\"abuse of social funds\\" and Cofidis, a moneylending company, said: \\"Given the personal difficulties that face Cyrille Guimard and the media risks that could unfairly bring to Cofidis, Cyrille Guimard and Cofidis have agreed to end their collaboration.\\" In 2003, Guimard became advisor and technical director of the French amateur cycling team Vélo Club Roubaix where he worked with the amateur Andy Schleck. In 2007, Vélo Club Roubaix Lille Metropole became a professional continental team with Guimard as manager. He remained with the team up to 2014. In June 2017 Guimard was announced as the coach of the French national team. His successor, in 2019, was Thomas Voeckler. == Cycling politics == Guimard was president of the professional riders' body, the Union Nationale des Coureurs Professionels, when he was 23.Interview de Cyrille Guimard, candidat à la présidence de la FFC http://velo101.com/actualite/default.asp?Id=16135&Section;=G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral He and another team manager, Roger Legeay, created the AIGCP,Association Internationale de Groupes Cyclistes Professionelles to represent teams in negotiations. Guimard failed to win election in 2009 as president of the Fédération Française de Cyclisme, the body representing France at the Union Cycliste Internationale.

In versions of MS-DOS from 1.1x through 6.22, the file comprised the MS-DOS kernel and is responsible for file access and program management. \`MSDOS.SYS\` is loaded by the DOS BIOS \`IO.SYS\` as part of the boot procedure. In some OEM versions of MS-DOS, the file is named \`MSDOS.COM\`. In Windows 95 (MS-DOS 7.0) through Windows ME (MS-DOS 8.0), the DOS kernel has been combined with the DOS BIOS into a single file, \`IO.SYS\` (aka \`WINBOOT.SYS\`), while \`MSDOS.SYS\` became a plain text file containing boot configuration directives instead. If a \`WINBOOT.INI\` file exists, the system will retrieve these configuration directives from \`WINBOOT.INI\` rather than from \`MSDOS.SYS\`. When Windows 9x is installed over a preexisting DOS install, the Windows file may be temporarily named \`MSDOS.W40\` for as long as Windows' dual-boot feature has booted the previous OS. Likewise, the \`MSDOS.SYS\` of the older system is named \`MSDOS.DOS\` for as long as Windows 9x is active. Some DOS utilities expect the \`MSDOS.SYS\` file to have a minimal file size of at least 1 KB. This is the reason why a large dummy comment is typically found in the \`MSDOS.SYS\` configuration file since Windows 95.

DoD policy is that other image formats can be used internally within a single system; however, NITFS is the default format for interchange between systems. NITFS provides a package containing information about the image, the image itself, and optional overlay graphics. (i.e. a \\"package\\" containing an image(s), subimages, symbols, labels, and text as well as other information related to the image(s)) NITFS supports the dissemination of secondary digital imagery from overhead collection platforms. Guidance on applying the suite of standards composing NITFS can be found in MIL- HDBK-1300A, National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (NITFS), 12 October 1994. The NITFS allows for Support Data Extensions (SDEs), which are a collection of data fields that provide space within the NITFS file structure for adding functionality. Documented and controlled separately from the NITFS suite of standards, SDEs extend NITF functionality with minimal impact on the underlying standard document. SDEs may be incorporated into an NITF file while maintaining backward compatibility because the identifier and byte count mechanisms allow applications developed prior to the addition of newly defined data to skip over extension fields they are not designed to interpret. These SDEs are described in the Compendium of Controlled Extensions (CE). This standard is mandated in the DoD for imagery product dissemination. NITF has been implemented and fielded since the early 1990s. Its content evolved over the years to embrace new technology in support of emerging operational requirements. NITF has adopted the ISO/IEC 15444-1 standard for imagery compression, JPEG 2000. Commercial implementations of the standard are largely driven by marketability to the DoD and IC. A follow-on update to the standard, Mil-Std-2500C, has been released. Following this update to 2500B, future documentation will be done using ISO/IEC documents and processes based on ISO/IEC 12087-5, Basic Image Interchange Format, in lieu of military standards. The following documents define the standard: * MIL-STD-2500C(1) -- National Imagery Transmission Format (Version 2.1) for the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard, 1 May 2006, Superseding MIL-STD-2500B/CN2 * MIL- STD-2500B(2) -- National Imagery Transmission Format (Version 2.1) for the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard, 22 August 1997 with Notice 1, 2 October 1998, and Notice 2, 1 March 2001. * NITF Extensions 2.1 -- The Compendium of Controlled Extensions (CE) for the National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF), Version 2.1, 16 November 2000. * MIL-STD-188-199(1)-- Vector Quantization Decompression for the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard, 27 June 1994 with Notice 1, 27 June 1996.

The low bap movement has been expanded, so that today it includes bookstores, youth centers and specialized magazines.

Ouellet is currently under contract to Ring of Honor (ROH), where he is a former ROH World Champion. Ouellet is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling as one-half of The Quebecers/The Amazing French Canadians with Jacques Rougeau (with whom he held the WWF Tag Team Championship on three occasions). Other promotions Ouellet has wrestled for include Extreme Championship Wrestling, the International Wrestling Association, Major League Wrestling, and NWA Total Nonstop Action. After retiring in 2011, Ouellet returned to the ring in 2016, undergoing a career renaissance with the gimmick of \\"part beast-turned-man, part old-time strongman\\". ==Professional wrestling careerEarly career (1987–1993)=== Carl Ouellet debuted in 1987. He worked on the independent circuit - at one point forming a tag team with \\"Evil\\" Eddie Watts known as \\"The Super Bees\\". In January 1993, Ouellet began wrestling for the International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico. While working in Puerto Rico, he was offered a tryout with the World Wrestling Federation. === World Wrestling Federation (1993–1995) == The Quebecers (1993–1994) ==== In 1993, Ouellet joined the World Wrestling Federation as the tag team partner of Jacques Rougeau. As one half of The Quebecers, Ouellet adopted the name \\"Pierre\\" and dressed like Mounties. This was a reference to Jacques's previous gimmick, The Mountie, which had been banned in Canada out of fear that the heelish character of The Mountie would lead to children mistrusting legitimate Mounties. The Quebecers sang their own entrance theme, in which they stated that, contrary to appearances, \\"We're not the Mounties\\". Later in the year they were joined by manager, Johnny Polo. The Quebecers held the WWF Tag Team Championship on three occasions. On September 13, 1993, they defeated the Steiner Brothers for the tag titles (under \\"Province of Quebec Rules\\", which provided for titles change hands on disqualifications). They were defeated by the 1-2-3 Kid and Marty Jannetty on January 10, 1994 and again by Men on a Mission on March 29 (during a tour of England) but each time regained the titles within days. They lost the belts a third and final time to The Headshrinkers on the April 26 episode of Monday Night Raw in Burlington, Vermont, which would soon lead to Pierre's sneak attack on Jacques. The feud culminated in the former partners' wrestling one another in Rougeau's retirement match on October 21, 1994 in Montreal, main-eventing a sold-out house show. ==== Jean-Pierre LaFitte (1995) ==== Ouellet in 1995. As a singles wrestler, Ouellet was repackaged in 1995 as \\"Jean-Pierre LaFitte\\", the descendant of real-life pirate named Jean LaFitte. As a pirate he wore an eyepatch over his blind right eye. He engaged in a three-month feud with Bret Hart and stole the mirrored sunglasses that Hart handed to fans at ringside. After LaFitte stole Hart's trademark leather jacket, the enemies faced one another at In Your House 3 on September 24, 1995, where Hart forced Ouellet to submit by using the Sharpshooter. In his Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Dave Meltzer described this pay-per-view match as the \\"show saver\\" and an \\"excellent match.\\"Dave Meltzer. Wrestling Observer Newsletter, October 2, 1995 Hart later recalled, \\"In a lot of ways, I loved working with guys like him. He was a guy, that when he threw you in the ropes, he really threw you in the rope...everything he did was power, and at the same time he was a very safe guy.... He took a lot of pride in his work, he really wanted to have a great match with me...And so we worked really hard, and it was a really good match.\\"Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart: The Dungeon Collection, WWE Home Video, 2013. Ouellet's WWF career came to an end after an alleged legit conflict with The Kliq, a backstage group including main-event wrestlers Shawn Michaels and Diesel. According to Shane Douglas, who was working with the company at that time, a match pitting LaFitte against Nash, then the WWF Champion, in a house show in LaFitte's hometown Montreal was booked to end without a clean finish, with Lafitte winning by either DQ or countout, enabling the WWF to return to Montreal for a rematch at a later time. However, due to backstage politicking by Shawn Michaels the booking was reversed into a clean pinfall for Diesel. In turn, LaFitte refused to be pinned by Diesel and the match ended in a double- countout. Due to his refusal to put Diesel over, LaFitte was buried due to the Kliq's influence. Ouellet left the WWF in November 1995. ===World Championship Wrestling (1996–1997)=== In 1996, Ouellet reunited with Jacques Rougeau and moved to World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where the duo was known as The Amazing French Canadians. They wore more traditional wrestling gear, but failed to duplicate the success they had found in the WWF. They had the distinction of losing to Arn Anderson and Steve \\"Mongo\\" McMichael in Anderson's last match. The Amazing French Canadians were managed by Col. Robert Parker (who began dressing in a French Foreign Legion uniform), and they began feuding with Harlem Heat as a result of tension between Parker and Harlem Heat's manager, Sister Sherri. After Harlem Heat defeated the Amazing French Canadians at World War 3 on November 24, 1996, Sherri won the right to fight Parker for three minutes. Parker was beaten down by Sherri, but the rivals later reconciled and fell in love with one another. Ouellet won a 'patch match' against The Giant in a house show in Montreal and was fired shortly after. ===Return to the WWF (1998–2000)=== Along with Jacques, Ouellet was rehired by the WWF in 1998 yet again, but rarely utilized. Ouellet competed in the Brawl for All tournament, but lost in the first round to \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams. The Quebecers took part in the tag team battle royal at WrestleMania XIV, but disbanded once again soon afterward. Along with other WWF employees such as Bart Gunn and Vader, he worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling as part of a talent loan, and spent time in the WWF's Memphis based developmental territory, Power Pro Wrestling, where he was known as \\"Kris Kannonball\\". He left the WWF once more when his contract expired in January 2000, unhappy with the way he was being used. ===Extreme Championship Wrestling (2000)=== Ouellet began working for Extreme Championship Wrestling in mid-2000, squashing jobbers for several weeks before losing to Justin Credible in a match for Credible's ECW World Heavyweight Championship. ===Return to WCW (2000)=== Ouellet and Rougeau had a second run in WCW in August 2000, briefly joining Team Canada at the New Blood Rising pay-per-view. Rougeau—who had additionally served as a guest referee in Lance Storm's win over Mike Awesome—left immediately afterwards, upset with the WCW creative team's plans for him, while Ouellet worked two more dates in Canada and was awarded the WCW Hardcore Championship by Storm on August 14 as Storm held three different titles at the same time. He lost the title that same night to Norman Smiley. Due to working visa issues, Ouellet could not work in the US, and had to be released back to Canada soon after. ===International Wrestling 2000 and International Wrestling Association (2000–2005)=== Between 2000 and 2003, Ouellet appeared with Rougeau's International Wrestling 2000 promotion. He headlined an event in the Verdun Auditorium in Montreal on December 29, 2000, facing King Kong Bundy in front of an audience of 4,000. In the summer of 2003 Ouellet decided to begin wrestling in the Quebec area once more. Ouellet returned to the Puerto Rican promotion International Wrestling Association, this time wrestling as Jean-Pierre Laffite. He was brought in by Savio Vega to join his stable, The Corporation. Immediately he feuded with then-IWA Intercontinental Champion Ricky Banderas, a feud that lasted around 3 months. He was managed by José Chaparro, another member of Vega's Corporation. At Summer Attitude, after a losing effort to Ricky Banderas. In April 2005 defeated Banderas to win IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship for first time in his career. Lafitte left IWA. ===NWA Total Nonstop Action (2003, 2005–2007)=== In November 2003, Ouellet debuted in NWA Total Nonstop Action as \\"X\\", a masked wrestler who competed primarily in the X Division as he had a feud with Christopher Daniels and Sonjay Dutt. He left after two months. In February 2005, Ouellet began hosting the French version of TNA Impact! from the RDS studios with Marc Blondin, replacing Michel Letourneur. He even had a war of the words against comedian Jean-René Dufort (of Infoman fame), to which Dufort responded by adopting the wrestling gimmick \\"La Punaise Masquée\\" (The Masked Tick) and \\"challenging\\" Ouellet to a match. However, Dufort backed out before the match could take place. In October 2007 he quit the company and was replaced by Sylvain Grenier. ===Independent circuit (2005–2011)=== In the mid-2000s, Ouellet wrestled for the Montreal-based International Wrestling Syndicate and the Hull-based CPW International promotion, under the \\"Pierre Carl Ouellet\\" name once again. In October 2007, Ouellet wrestled a dark match for World Wrestling Entertainment under the name of \\"Carl Ouellet\\" at the ECW / SmackDown! tapings. He was defeated by Tommy Dreamer. Ouellet also wrestled for All-Star promotions in Britain alongside his friends and tag team partners with Rene Dupree. Ouellet has mainly been working a lot of Tag Team matches with Rene Dupree, Robbie Dynamite, Hannibal and Mikey Whiplash. He defeated Sylvain Grenier in an RDS battle on June 21, 2008 in Hawkesbury, Ontario Canada with Marc Blondin serving as the special referee. He then defeated long-time rival Kevin Nash on May 30, 2009 at the International Wrestling Syndicate's 10th Anniversary show by making him submit via an armbar. In an interview with Slam! Sports on August 6, 2008, Ouellet declared that he would like another stint with the WWE. Ouellet retired from professional wrestling on February 8, 2011. === Return to the independent circuit as PCO (2016–2018) === On May 21, 2016, Ouellet made his return to professional wrestling at an MWF event, entitled \\"Collision,\\" in Valleyfield, Quebec, Canada, defeating Jake Matthews, following a cannonball. On November 5, 2017, Ouellet, as \\"Quebecer\\" Jean-Pierre Lafitte, defeated Hannibal to win the Great North Wrestling Canadian Championship in Rockland, ON. On May 25, 2018, Ouellet was defeated by Hannibal via disqualification in a Great North Wrestling Championship rematch in Pembroke, ON. Post-match, Ouellet was stripped of the championship for his assault on GNW President, Michael Andrews. Under a new gimmick as a \\"French Frankenstein\\" as Ouellet described it, he became a regular name in several independent promotions. On April 2, 2018, Ouellet defeated Walter at Game Changer Wrestling's (GCW) Joey Janela's Spring Break 2 in New Orleans. Ouellet's performance and online footage of his unconventional workout regimen impressed the independent wrestling audience, and led to many higher-profile bookings. PCO doing a dive onto Rickey Shane Page in 2018 On June 18, 2018, Ouellet was announced as the first of twenty-four participants for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's (PWG) annual Battle of Los Angeles tournament. At 2018 Battle of Los Angeles - Stage One on September 15, he made his company debut, losing to Brody King in the Opening Round. Two nights later, at 2018 Battle of Los Angeles - Final Stage, he led a losers' ten-man tag team match, in which Team PCO (Ouellet, Darby Allin, Dan Barry, Jody Fleisch and Puma King) defeated Team DJ Z (DJ Z, Adam Brooks, David Starr, T-Hawk and Timothy Thatcher). ===Ring of Honor (2018–present)=== On December 1, 2018, Ouellet announced his exclusive signing with Ring of Honor. He debuted for ROH at the December 15 tapings joining up with Marty Scurll and Brody King in a new stable called Villain Enterprises. At Honor Reigns Supreme 2019, Villain Enterprises defeated Silas Young and the Briscoe Brothers. PCO and King would then go on to win the 2019 ROH Tag Wars Tournament during the ROH Road To G1 Supercard tour in February 2019, and on March 15, 2019, he and King defeated the Briscoes to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship for the first time in a Las Vegas street fight at the ROH 17th Anniversary Show. The following night at the Ring of Honor Wrestling tapings, PCO, King and Scurll defeated The Kingdom to win the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, making PCO a double champion within a 24 hour span. At the G1 Supercard, PCO and King dropped the ROH World Tag Team Championship to the Guerrillas of Destiny in a winner takes all four-way tag team match also including the Briscoe Brothers and Evil and Sanada, with G.O.D.'s IWGP Tag Team Championship belts also on the line. In a Six Man Tag title defence, PCO would get the winning fall over ROH World Champion Matt Taven, which gave him a future title opportunity. On April 27 at the 2019 Crockett Cup event, PCO and King won the eight-team tournament (winning three matches in the same night) to not only win the Crockett Cup Trophy, but also win the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship as well. At War of the Worlds, PCO challenged ROH World Champion Matt Taven for the championship, however he was defeated. The following night, PCO continued his feud with Taven by attacking Taven following his win over Mark Haskins. PCO would then compete in a Four Corner Survival match to determine the #1 contender for the ROH World Championship which was won by Jeff Cobb. At State of the Art, PCO competed in a DEFY or DENY match for the ROH World Championship which was won by Taven. At Death Before Dishonor XVII, PCO defeated Kenny King in a First round match in the Final Battle ROH World Championship #1 contender tournament. At Glory By Honor XVII, PCO defeated fellow member of Villain Enterprises Marty Scurll in the finals of the tournament to become the #1 contender for the ROH World Championship. At Final Battle, PCO defeated Rush to become the ROH World Champion, in the process once again becoming a double champion in ROH, as well as becoming a world champion for the first time in his career. After his title win, Villain Enterpraises feuded with Rush's La Facción Ingobernable, retaining the World title against Dragon Lee, but losing against Rush on February 29. ==Personal life== Ouellet lost vision in his right eye at the age of 12 after an accident with a pellet gun. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Catch Wrestling Association **CWA World Tag Team Champion (1 time) – with Rhino Richards *CPW International **CPW Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Dangerous Dan *International Wrestling Association **IWA Intercontinental Championship (1 time) *Game Changer Wrestling **GCW Extreme Championship (1 time, final) *Great North Wrestling **GNW Canadian Championship (1 time) *International Wrestling Syndicate **IWS World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **Tag Team Royal Rumble (2004) - with Sid Vicious *Jonquiere Championship Wrestling **JCW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *National Wrestling Alliance **NWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Brody King **Crockett Cup (2019) – with Brody King *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Ranked No. \\"393\\" of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the \\"PWI Years\\" in 2003 ** Ranked No. 31 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2020https://heelbynature.com/all-elite- wrestling/jon-moxley-tops-2020-pwi-500-list/ **Ranked No. \\"83\\" of the top 100 tag teams of the PWI Years with Jacques Rougeau in 2003 *Ring of Honor **ROH World Championship (1 time) **ROH World Six Man Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Brody King and Marty Scurll **ROH World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Brody King **Tag Wars (2019) – with Brody King **ROH World Championship No.1 Contendership Tournament (2019) ** Best of ROH Awards: Holy S*** Moment of the Year (2019) ** Best of ROH Awards: Faction of the Year (2019) - with Villain Enterprises *Top of the World Wrestling **TOW Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Al Snow *World Championship Wrestling **WCW Hardcore Championship (1 time) *World Wrestling Federation **WWF Tag Team Championship (3 times) – with Quebecer Jacques *Xtreme Zone Wrestling **XZW Ironman Championship (1 time) ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:1967 births Category:Blind people from Canada Category:Canadian disabled sportspeople Category:Canadian male professional wrestlers Category:Fictional pirates Category:French Quebecers Category:Living people Category:People from Montérégie Category:Professional wrestlers from Quebec Category:Professional wrestling announcers ","title":"Pierre Carl Ouellet"},{"id":"2001784","text":"Latrodectus geometricus, commonly known as the brown widow, brown button spider, grey widow, brown black widow, house button spider or geometric button spider, is one of the widow spiders in the genus Latrodectus. As such, it is a 'cousin' to the more infamous Latrodectus mactans (black widow). Orange hourglass marking on the belly of a brown widow A brown widow's egg sac Brown widow spider found in Cairo, Egypt == Description == L. geometricus is slightly smaller and generally lighter in color than the black widow species; the color can range from tan to dark brown to black, with shades of grey also possible. Like the black widow species in the United States, L. geometricus has a prominent hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of the abdomen; the brown widow's hourglass, however, is usually a vivid orange or a yellowish color. Unlike the black widow, L. geometricus has a black-and-white geometric pattern on the dorsal side of its abdomen. Although the Latin name comes from this pattern, a spider's coloring can and does darken over time and the pattern may become obscured. Also, they have stripes on their legs. Brown widows are often preyed on by mud daubers and sometimes by digger wasps. Brown widows can be located by finding their egg sacs, which are easily identifiable. They resemble a sandspur, having pointed projections all over, and they are sometimes described as \\"tufted\\", \\"fluffy\\", or \\"spiky\\" in appearance. Eggs hatch in approximately 20 days.Jackman, J A (2006). \\"Spiders \\", Texas Agricultural Extension Service. Female brown widows lay about 120–150 eggs per sac and can make 20 egg sacs over a lifetime. Similar widows include the L. rhodesiensis, a brown-colored relative of L. geometricus which is native to Zimbabwe. Both species are collectively known as brown button spiders throughout southern Africa. Brown button spiders are known to have a lifespan of about two years. == Geographic distribution == The brown widow has a cosmopolitan distribution. It is thought by some researchers to originate in South Africa, although this is uncertain, as specimens were discovered in both Africa and South America. They are usually found around buildings in tropical areas. They can compete with populations of the black widow spider. It is found in many areas of South Africa, the United States (including Hawaii), Australia, Afghanistan, Southern Europe, China, Japan, Dominican Republic, Cyprus, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Uruguay, and Brazil, and there have been sightings in the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, India (Ahmedabad) and Thailand. As of 2012, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, may in fact be displacing black widow spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory.Are Brown Widow Spiders Displacing Black Widows? http://www.entsoc.org/press-releases/are-brown-widow-spiders- displacing-black-widows While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the black widow, than the black widow is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected since brown widow bites are less toxic than those of black widows, thus posing less of a threat as they displace black widows over time. ==Toxicology== Like all Latrodectus species, L. geometricus has a neurotoxic venom. The venom acts on nerve endings causing the very unpleasant symptoms of latrodectism. However, brown widow bites are usually not very dangerous; usually much less dangerous than those of L. mactans, the black widow. The effects of the toxin are usually confined to the bite area and surrounding tissue, unlike the black widow's. Mere toxicity of the venom is not the only factor in dangerousness. Brown widow bites are minor compared to black widow bites because they cannot deliver the same amount of venom as the black widow. The LD50 of L. geometricus venom has been measured in mice as 0.43 mg/kg, and separately again as 0.43 mg/kg (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.31–0.53). == References  External links == * Sexual Cannibalism in the Brown Widow Spider (Latrodectus geometricus) * Brown Widow Spider at the Center for Invasive Species Research geometricus Category:Cosmopolitan spiders Category:Spiders described in 1841 Category:Taxa named by Carl Ludwig Koch ","title":"Latrodectus geometricus"},{"id":"2001788","text":"Planet Us (pronounced Planet-uss) was a short-lived supergroup that formed in 2002 with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, Neal Schon on guitar, Michael Anthony on bass, and Deen Castronovo on drums. The band later recruited a fifth member—famed guitarist Joe Satriani—when their original choice, Slash, turned them down. The band's name Planet Us has been alternatively spelled as Planet US in various publications. ==History== In 2002, with some down time between Journey albums and Van Halen still unreformed at this point, the members decided to kickstart a separate project. The band was announced in early 2002 yet Schon and Castronovo were still recording and subsequently toured with Journey that summer, while Hagar was touring with David Lee Roth in the successful 'Sans Halen' tour. The new group then planned to reconvene in the Fall but the initial recording sessions scheduled in San Francisco were again delayed until January 2003 while Castronovo recovered from an illness. In the end, only two songs were written and recorded under the Planet Us name: \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Peeping Through a Hole\\" and neither was officially released by the band itself. \\"Vertigo\\" was originally intended for the first Spider-Man movie; however, it was turned down by Sony (correctly, says Sammy) for being \\"too f—in' heavy!\\" \\"Peeping Through a Hole,\\" a very dark song about an abused child, was later re-recorded by another of Neal Schon's projects, Soul SirkUS with Jeff Scott Soto on vocals, and released as \\"Peephole\\" on the Soul SirkUS \\"World Play\\" CD.Neal Schon discusses Soul SirkUS birth from Planet Us In an interview from late 2005, Neal Schon described how material he had originally written for Planet Us ended up on the Soul SirkUS project instead: \\"There was a couple songs that did end up on Journey's Generations that I wrote during the same time period that I wrote that material like \\"Faith in the Heartland\\" and \\"Out Of Harm's Way\\". They were all written in the same month. I wrote about twenty songs that month and it was all going to be for the project that I was doing with Sammy Hagar. ... I wanted to do something with this material that I had written with Planet Us. So, I decided to re-group and put it out with some guys that I think are 'happening'. And that's what I did. I sent Jeff (Scott Soto) all my material and he wrote all the vocals. When he got eight songs done, we went into the studio and knocked it out in a couple of days.\\"Neal Schon interview discusses Planet Us The band only appeared live four times, the first being at the 25th annual Bammies (aka the California Music Awards) on Saturday, April 27, 2002 in Oakland, California. After Sammy Hagar took the stage playing three songs with his band the Waboritas he announced a few friends and Schon, Anthony, and Castronovo took the stage. They then played \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Peeping Through a Hole\\" publicly for the first time. Hagar and Anthony had performed at the Bammies years earlier as Los Tres Gusanos. The second and third appearances also occurred when Schon, Anthony, and Castronovo joined Hagar on tour, this time at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas on May 17 and May 18, 2002. Both nights they ended Hagar's headlining show with performances of their only two songs. Their fourth and final performance occurred on March 12, 2003 on the syndicated radio show Rockline hosted by Bob Coburn. Sammy introduced the band's recently expanded line-up with Joe Satriani on guitar and after briefly explaining the origin of the 'side project' they played \\"Vertigo\\" to end the night. Planet Us never finished their planned album likely due to the busy nature of its members at the time. Hagar and Anthony returned to Van Halen with much fanfare in 2004 and subsequently went on a world tour. In frustration, Schon and Castronovo took the material written for Planet Us and formed Soul SirkUS with Soto, touring the results before returning to their regular duties in Journey. ==Epilogue== In 2008, Hagar released the songs \\"Vertigo\\" (now renamed to \\"Psycho Vertigo\\") and \\"Peephole\\" on his Cosmic Universal Fashion album. In the liner notes Hagar states: \\"Neal Schon has been a friend for years. We have talked about working together but the time had never been quite right. A few years ago we finally wrote a couple of songs, \\"Psycho Vertigo\\" and \\"Peephole\\", and decided to go into the studio and record. I called Michael Anthony to play his bass while Neal enlisted Deen Castronovo to play drums. I had a home studio in my basement where we worked out these two tracks. We were really excited about the way things were going and had already decided to call ourselves Planet Us. Then the phone rang and the Van Hagar reunion was an idea that was just too irresistible to pass up. I am happy these tracks are finally coming out.\\"Liner notes to Cosmic Universal Fashion Planet Us was the second project that Hagar and Schon formed, the first being the short-lived Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve from the mid-1980s. Although it seems unlikely that they will regroup and produce a proper album, Neal Schon has left the door open stating \\"If he (Hagar) calls me up and says 'Schon – let's go'. I'm gone and it'll be fun.\\" Satriani, Hagar and Anthony would later join forces for another band named Chickenfoot; that band formed in 2009. ==NotesExternal links== *Melodicrock.com news 2002 – First reports of Planet Us 'supergroup' forming *Schon Interview 2002 – Neal Schon discusses birth of Planet Us *Journey Newsletter – Photos of first Planet Us appearance in Oakland, 2002. *Planet Us in Vegas 2002 – News of 2nd & 3rd live appearances *Melodicrock Interview 2002 – Sammy discusses delay of Planet Us record *BW&BK; Jan. 2003 article – News of first Planet Us recording session *RedRocker Feb. 2003 announcement – Sammy puts Planet Us on hold *Planet Us on Rockline Mar. 2003 – Photos of Planet Us with Satriani on Rockline *Schon Interview Apr. 2005 – Neal Schon discusses aftermath of Planet Us *Schon Radio Interview Sept. 2005 – Neal Schon discusses breakup of Planet Us *\\"Peephole\\" lyrics – Soul SirkUS website Category:American hard rock musical groups Category:Rock music supergroups Category:Musical groups established in 2002 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2003 ","title":"Planet Us"},{"id":"2001789","text":"The Borda count electoral system can be combined with an instant-runoff procedure to create hybrid election methods that are called Nanson method and Baldwin method. Both methods are designed to satisfy the Condorcet criterion, and allow for incomplete ballots and equal rankings. == Nanson method == A ranked ballot with incomplete preferences, as illustrated by Nanson. The Nanson method is based on the original work of the mathematician Edward J. Nanson in 1882. Nanson's method eliminates those choices from a Borda count tally that are at or below the average Borda count score, then the ballots are retallied as if the remaining candidates were exclusively on the ballot. This process is repeated if necessary until a single winner remains. If a Condorcet winner exists, they will be elected. If not, (there is a Condorcet cycle) then the preference with the smallest majority will be eliminated. Nanson's method can be adapted to handle incomplete ballots (including \\"plumping\\") and equal rankings (\\"bracketing\\"), though he describes two different methods to handle these cases: a theoretically correct method involving fractions of a vote, and a practical method involving whole numbers (which has the side effect of diminishing the voting power of voters who plump or bracket). This then allows the use of Approval-style voting for uninformed voters who merely wish to approve of some candidates and disapprove of others. The method can be adapted to multi-winner elections by removing the name of a winner from the ballots and re-calculating, though this just elects the highest-ranked n candidates and does not result in proportional representation. Schwartz in 1986 studied a slight variant of Nanson's rule, in which candidates less than but not equal to the average Borda count score are eliminated in each round. == Baldwin method == Candidates are voted for on ranked ballots as in the Borda count. Then, the points are tallied in a series of rounds. In each round, the candidate with the fewest points is eliminated, and the points are re-tallied as if that candidate were not on the ballot. This method actually predates Nanson's, who notes it was already in use by the Trinity College Dialectic Society. It was systematized by Joseph M. Baldwin in 1926, who incorporated a more efficient matrix tabulation, extending it to support incomplete ballots and equal rankings. The two methods have been confused with each other in some literature. == Satisfied and failed criteria == The Nanson method and the Baldwin method satisfy the Condorcet criterion. Because Borda always gives any existing Condorcet winner more than the average Borda points, the Condorcet winner will never be eliminated. They do not satisfy the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion, the monotonicity criterion, the participation criterion, the consistency criterion and the independence of clones criterion, while they do satisfy the majority criterion, the mutual majority criterion, the Condorcet loser criterion and the Smith criterion. The Nanson method satisfies and the Baldwin method violates reversal symmetry. Both the Nanson and the Baldwin methods can be run in polynomial time to obtain a single winner. For the Baldwin method, however, at each stage, there might be several candidates with lowest Borda score. In fact, it is NP- complete to decide whether a given candidate is a Baldwin winner, i.e., whether there exists an elimination sequence that leaves a given candidate uneliminated. Both methods are computationally more difficult to manipulate than Borda's method. == Use of Nanson and Baldwin == Nanson's method was used in city elections in the U.S. town of Marquette, Michigan in the 1920s. It was formerly used by the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and in the election of members of the University Council of the University of Adelaide. It was used by the University of Melbourne until 1983. == References == * Duncan Sommerville (1928) \\"Certain hyperspatial partitionings connected with preferential voting\\", Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society 28(1):368–82.

He is known for owning and operating the Gallery Furniture retail chain. ==Biography== McIngvale was born on February 11, 1951, in Starkville, Mississippi. He graduated from Bishop Lynch High School in Dallas and attended North Texas State University, now University of North Texas, in Denton where he played football. He and his wife have three children. Their daughter Elizabeth was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder at age 12, and at one point several doctors declared her illness too severe to be treatable. McIngvale and his wife sent her to the Menninger Clinic when she was 15, where she underwent Exposure Response Prevention Therapy and eventually learned to manage her OCD. She later became an assistant professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Baylor College of Medicine, and founded the Peace of Mind Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping people with OCD. In 2002, Jim McIngvale co-authored the book Always Think Big with Thomas Duening and John Ivancevich, which chronicles the ups and downs of McIngvale's entrepreneurial career. He lives in the Northgate Forest community in an unincorporated area of Harris County, Texas. Ericka Mellon of the Houston Chronicle said that he was \\"one of Northgate's most recognizable residents.\\"Mellon, Ericka. \\"SUBURBAN SECESSION / Neighbors petition to join Klein / Northgate Forest residents complain of lower property values and performance with Spring .\\" Houston Chronicle. Thursday April 5, 2007. B1 MetFront. McIngvale is best known for his energetic, fast-paced sales pitches, typically ending with some variant of his catchphrase \\"saves you money!\\" His distinctive sales style originated from an incident that occurred early on in Gallery Furniture's history. Faced with financial difficulties, McIngvale invested all his remaining money, approximately $10,000, in a television commercial to be aired on two stations. While watching the commercial being produced, he became dissatisfied and ad- libbed a sales pitch, speaking rapidly because of the limited amount of time available. The commercial proved very effective, and his sales increased dramatically afterward. In 1999, McIngvale spoke to the British Deming Association annual conference about the influence of W Edwards Deming on his business methods. In May 2009, the Houston Chronicle reported that McIngvale refused to pay $48,000 dollars of taxes to the Greater Northside Management District that was assessed from 2005 to 2007; he paid taxes to the district in 2008. His northside facility is within the district's boundary. McIngvale said the management district does not do enough to maintain the area; the business owner described the management district's taxation policies as \\"taxation without representation.\\" The district sued McIngvale to try to force him to pay the taxes, and McIngvale said he's willing to dispute the charges in court. In June 2019, McIngvale suffered a possible transient ischemic attack. When Hurricane Imelda flooded Houston in 2019, McIngvale once again opened the doors of Gallery Furniture and partnered with Crisis Clean Up to provide free meals and shelter at the North Freeway location.https://www.galleryfurniture.com/imelda.html ==Political views== In 2010, Jim McIngvale supported the Tea Party movement.

The homes in Victorian Village were built from 1846 into the 1890s, and range in style from Neo-classical through Late Gothic Revival.Historic Sites - Victorian Village. Edward C. Jones, one of Memphis's most significant Victorian-era architects, and his partner, Matthias Harvey Baldwin, built the Woodruff-Fontaine House (1870) and renovated the Harsson- Goyer-Lee House (1871).Perre Magness, Edward Culliatt Jones, The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009.

The Mallory-Neely House (1852) was built in Italian villa style with a central tower for banker Isaac Kirtland and extensively renovated and expanded during the 1880s and 1890s. The interior is well preserved, with much of the original late-19th-century furnishings intact.Wendy Campbell, Mallory-Neely House, The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009.

It was expanded in 1871 by Charles Goyer, a founder of Union Planters Bank.Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities, Historic Sites Tour. The Pillow- McIntyre House (ca. 1852) is a two-story Greek Revival home purchased in 1873 by Mexican War and Confederate General Gideon Pillow. This striking eclectic- style Victorian had been unused for years, but with the assistance of corporate and community donations it was refurbished in 2004. The Woodruff- Fontaine House (1870) was built in French-Victorian style by Amos Woodruff, a successful carriage maker, entrepreneur and politician. The second resident, Noland Fontaine, was a factor in the Memphis Cotton Exchange. The house was deeded to the city in 1936, and in later years was used for an art school. In 1961 the art school moved, and the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities took over the house and restored it with 19th-century regional antiques and textiles. A Victorian Gingerbread playhouse is also on the grounds.Woodrff-Fontaine House Museum, 680 Adams Ave., Memphis, TN 38105. The Snowden home in the Annesdale-Snowden Historic District dates from the same era. In 1850, Dr. Samuel Mansfield built this \\"Italianate villa\\" on his plantation just outside Memphis. The house was situated on a knoll above what was then the stage route to Mississippi. In 1869 Colonel Robert C. Brinkley bought the estate as a wedding gift to his daughter, Annie Overton Brinkley, and her new husband, Colonel Bogardus Snowden. The estate was named Annesdale in her honor. In the first decade of the 20th century, Col. Snowden and his sons John and Robert built two subdivisions on the estate, Annesdale Park (1903), claimed to be the first in the South, and Snowden Homestead (1910). The streets in these then-affluent subdivisions were named for the Snowden children. Memphis entrepreneur Kemmons Wilson and other well-known Memphis names resided there. After World War II, the neighborhood gradually declined until it began to be gentrified in the 1970s and after it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Snowden home is not open to the public.Cashiola, Mary. The Secret Mansion in Annesdale-Snowden. Memphis Flyer.

Some historians of economics believe that he coined the phrase laissez faire, laissez passer. Evidence was to be found when the French State parted the West Indies Company privilege - monopoly - on the slave trade. He is also credited with coining the term \\"bureaucracy\\". Together with François Quesnay, whose disciple he was, he was a leader of the Physiocratic School. Gournay's father was Claude Vincent, a merchant in Saint-Malo as well as a secretary to the king. Gournay didn't write much, but had a great influence on French economic thought through his conversations with many important theorists. He became instrumental in popularizing the work of Richard Cantillon in France. Gournay was appointed an intendant du commerce in 1751. One of the main themes of his term in office was his opposition to government regulations because of what he saw as the way they stunted commerce. He coined the term bureaucratie (literally \\"government by desks\\") to describe the situation. Gournay's disdain for government regulation of commerce influenced his disciple Turgot. Gournay's first name is often mistakenly given as \\"Jean\\", due to an error made by Turgot in his letter to Jean-François Marmontel known as In Praise of Gournay.

It is a local road serving Franconia, Bethlehem, and Littleton, New Hampshire, which I-93 bypasses. Its northern extension, Vermont Route 18, continues northward from the Connecticut River to St. Johnsbury, Vermont. NH 18 closely parallels I-93 for its entire length and has several interchanges with the Interstate highway. ==Route description== NH 18 begins as a spur of I-93 (the Franconia Notch Parkway) at the height of land in Franconia Notch. (U.S. Route 3 is overlapped with I-93 on the Parkway.) NH 18 proceeds to the northwest, intersecting NH 141 and NH 142, near its interchange with I-93. In downtown Franconia, NH 18 joins with NH 116 and meets the eastern end of NH 117 before leaving town and crossing into Bethlehem. NH 18 has two interchanges with I-93 in Bethlehem, joining U.S. Route 302 westbound at the second one (US 302 east provides access to downtown). The highway crosses into Littleton, splitting with NH 116 in the center of town. Just west of downtown, US 302 splits from NH 18 as well. (This intersection is signed as the northern terminus of NH 10, although this designation officially ends much further south.) Northwest of town, NH 18 joins NH 135 near another interchange with I-93. The two routes have a direct interchange with I-93 near the Connecticut River at exit 44 (I-93's last exit in New Hampshire). NH 135 splits off NH 18 before it crosses the river into Vermont (along with I-93 to its west) and becomes VT 18. ==History== 75px Route 18 was originally part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, a transcontinental auto trail organized in 1919 running from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, via Ontario.Max J.

The tomb is unique in that it has two subsidiary burial chambers for the pharaoh's wives Tiye and Sitamen (who was also his daughter). The tomb's layout and decoration follow the tombs of the king's predecessors, Amenhotep II (KV35) and Thutmose IV (KV43); however, the decoration is much finer in quality. It was officially discovered by Prosper Jollois and Édouard de Villiers du Terrage, engineers with Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in August 1799, but had probably been open for some time before that. Subsequently someone removed images of the pharaoh's head in several places, which can be seen today in the Louvre. The tomb was officially cleared by Howard Carter in the early twentieth century. Since 1989, a Japanese team from Waseda University led by Sakuji Yoshimura and Jiro Kondo has been working for excavation as well as conservation. The sarcophagus is missing from the tomb.

Originally formed in 1991 by brothers Johnny Gioeli and Joey Gioeli, the band consisted of five members, Johnny Gioeli, Joey Gioeli, Neal Schon, Todd Jensen and Deen Castronovo. The band's most recent album is Life, which was released in 2019. Joey Gioeli has not appeared on a Hardline album since 2002's II after retiring from music to focus on family business. Johnny Gioeli remains the only original member of the band. ==History Formation, debut album and first break-up (1991–1992) === Hardline is a band created by brothers Johnny Gioeli and Joey Gioeli, who had previously played in the bands Killerhit and Brunette (which at one point was the top-drawing band in Hollywood, setting the all-time attendance record at Gazzarri's), starred in the unreleased Roman Coppola film 'Smash Crash & Burn' as the band Royal Smash, and later played in the band Gravity, and have since returned to Hardline. The band originally also included guitarist Neal Schon of Journey and Bad English, bassist Todd Jensen (ex-Sequel), and drummer Deen Castronovo. The group's sound was a mainstream commercialized mixture of glam metal and AOR. Two of the group's first songs were played in the movie Rapid Fire which starred Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts expert, Bruce Lee, at the actor's request. Their debut album Double Eclipse was released on April 28, 1992, and was well received by audiences and had extensive radio airplay at the time. It consisted of many tracks suitable for the Album-oriented rock genre. They toured with artists such as Mr. Big and Extreme across America. Several music videos such as 'Hot Cherie', 'Takin' Me Down', and 'Can't Find My Way' were made to promote the album. The Danny Spanos cover of 'Hot Cherie' was their most famous performance. The Japanese edition of the album featured the bonus track \\"Love Leads The Way\\". Although they mainly performed as opening acts for artists, they did do their own shows too. Plans for a Japan tour were also made but folded after the band broke up in late 1992. Extensive touring in other countries such as Europe were also planned, but again did not materialise after the band's initial break up. On November 2, 1992, the Hardline song \\"In the Hands of Time\\" was played in its entirety during a montage on the \\"princess of Tides\\" episode of the TV serial, Baywatch === Reunion attempts, new line-up and II (1995–2003) === After Hardline lost its record deal, Neal Schon departed to begin several projects before finally rejoining Journey. Former Jag Panzer and Shrapnel Records legend Joey Tafolla was approached to join but was unable to participate at the time due to his work schedule, consisting primarily of building his southern California merchandising company. Todd Jensen and Deen Castronovo left to join Ozzy Osbourne's backing band, though Jensen was replaced by Geezer Butler. Eventually, Deen Castronovo also joined Journey. Drummer Bobby Rock played on Hardline's second album, II. He had previously played several times with the Gioeli brothers in the band Brunette, replacing their regular drummer. They met via Rock's former Vinnie Vincent Invasion bandmate Dana Strum, who produced one of Brunette's demos, on which Rock played some drum tracks. Rock suggested his friend, LA session bassist Christopher Maloney, who had previously worked with Dweezil Zappa, to handle the bass duties on II. Due to Maloney's focus on promoting his solo album Control as well as working with other artists, he was unable to join the band for \\"The Gods Festival\\" in Bradford, England in June 2002. Producer Bob Burch played bass at the festival in his stead. Angel keyboardist Michael T. Ross, a friend to Tafolla, joined the band for II and the live DVD. Former The Storm guitarist Josh Ramos was signed up to play lead guitar for Hardline at \\"The Gods Festival,\\" and, when Tafolla was unable to finish recording lead guitar for II, was brought in and, in two long, pressure-packed days, laid down all the leads for the album. Johnny Gioeli was displeased with the performance at The Gods festival, and often discredits it. The band tried to revive the original Hardline line up for the performance, but things didn't go to plan. He could not stop the DVD and CDs from being released due to the Frontiers record label's demands, the two bonus tracks \\"Hypnotised\\" and \\"Mercy\\" were released without his permission. The acoustic version of \\"Only a Night\\" is also available on the CD version, which was also a exclusive bonus track from Japan. === Changes, Leaving the End Open e second break-up (2009–2010) === Hardline's third studio album, Leaving the End Open, was released on April 17, 2009 in Europe and on May 19 in the United States, after much delay. It was originally slated for release in Spring 2006. Recording began in 2004, then under the title 'Just Add Water'. They initially asked ex Ozzy Osbourne and Quiet Riot bassist Rudy Sarzo to join the band, but he was busy with other projects at the time. Instead, White Fang bassist Jamie Brown took his place, with Atma Anur on drums and returning member Michael T Ross on keyboards. The album could be described as a co-project between Gioeli and Ramos, the latter having contributed significantly to the lyrics and concept of the project. The album's artwork is also the first album cover by the group that doesn't include a reference to their first album, Double Eclipse. Johnny Gioeli expressed interest for touring for this album but plans never materialised, as he was busy touring with Axel Rudi Pell at the time. This line up is one of the only eras of Hardline that never played live on stage with the members of this album. . === Italian new era with Alessandro Del Vecchio (2011–present) === On December 22, 2011, Johnny Gioeli confirmed, via the Frontiers Records official site, that he and Italian keyboard player and producer Alessandro Del Vecchio of Edge of Forever and Eden's Curse would release Hardline's fourth studio album in mid-2012. Entitled Danger Zone, the new album's art features an eclipse to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the debut album Double Eclipse and was released on May 18, 2012 by Frontiers Records. Del Vecchio commented that he had written the lyrics and music for the album with Gioeli's vocals in mind, and sent demos to Frontiers president Serafino Perugino, who then sent the demos to Gioeli, who immediately became interested in reforming Hardline once again. Music video shooting for the track \\"Fever Dreams\\" began on April 15, and the final video was released on May 18. Via Frontiers Records's official electronic press kit for Danger Zone, Johnny Gioeli and Alessandro Del Vecchio announced that \\"by the time you watch this, we will already be working on the next [album].\\" Hardline appeared live, for the first time since \\"The Gods Festival,\\" at the Sweden Rock Festival on June 7, 2013. Axel Rudi Pell drummer Mike Terrana and returning Hardline guitarist Josh Ramos joined the band in place of Thorsten Koehne and Francesco Jovino to play ten songs from all four Hardline albums, notably performing songs from Leaving the End Open and Danger Zone live for the first time. Additionally, Hardline played in person at the tenth anniversary of the Melodic Rock Festival \\"Firefest\\" in Nottingham on October 19, 2013 as the headlining band. Drummer Mark Cross stood in for Mike Terrana for the performance, and bass player Nikola Mazzucconi stood in for Anna Portalupi. On October 14, 2016, Hardline released their fifth album called Human Nature with returning guitarist Josh Ramos, first time performing on a Hardline album since 2009's Leaving the End Open but had been continuously touring with the group since 2013. Human Nature was received quite positively by fans and critics, with offering homages to their 1992 debut album Double Eclipse with a fresh new sound. They performed only 2 shows in 2016, but toured extensively for the new record throughout Europe during 2017. A Japanese edition of Human Nature was also released which includes a special orchestral arrangement of Take You Home. During 2017 their Human Nature tour was changed to the Double Eclipse 25th Anniversary Tour which was also that year, however newer songs from Human Nature were also still performed. These tours were very successful. On May 6, 2018, it was announced that long time guitarist since 2002, Josh Ramos would leave Hardline, due to conflicts over production reasons and creative differences. Ramos was quickly replaced with the guitarist Mario Percudani who appeared on the Gioeli - Castronovo side project album (which also featured original Hardline member Deen Castronovo on drums & guest vocals) and is now a permanent member. On August 14, 2018, Johnny Gioeli confirmed during a new update video for his Pledgemusic campaign for his upcoming solo album that Hardline were working on their sixth album titled Life, which was eventually released April 26, 2019. It is the first album to feature their new guitarist. It also contains a cover of the Queen song Who Wants To Live Forever as Gioeli often exclaims that Freddie Mercury is a huge influence on his voice, and many Hardline fans often compare the two singers that sound alike. The cover was also a dedication to Mercury and Queen. An extensive tour of the Life album followed, which began in 2019 majorly across Europe and Germany, and still continues in 2020, but was halted in the middle of the year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It is confirmed that the postponed dates will take place in 2021. A forthcoming live CD and DVD set, 'Life Live' was recorded and filmed at the Frontiers Rock Festival in 2019 in Milan Italy, featuring tracks from the Life album performed live for the very first time, as well as classics from Double Eclipse, and special guest appearance by Deen Castronovo on drums for certain songs from the Double Eclipse era tracks. Released in February 2020, it will be their first official live recording since the Live at the Gods Festival 2002 CD & DVD release in 2003. It is confirmed that Hardline are currently working on their next upcoming album. ==MembersCurrent members=== Hardline Rockharz 2019 55.jpg|Singer Johnny Gioeli Hardline Rockharz 2019 18.jpg|Keyboarder Alessandro Del Vecchio Hardline Rockharz 2019 40.jpg|Guitarist Mario Percudani Hardline Rockharz 2019 44.jpg|Bassist Anna Portalupi Hardline Rockharz 2019 30.jpg|Drummer Marco Di Salvia * Johnny Gioeli – lead vocals, acoustic guitar (1991–1992, 1999–present) * Alessandro Del Vecchio – keyboards, backing vocals (2011–present) * Mario Percudani – guitars (2018–present) * Anna Portalupi – bass (2011–present) * Marco Di Salvia – drums (2018–present) ===Former members==Guitars==== * Joey Gioeli (1991–1992, 1999–2003) * Neal Schon (1991–1992) * Joey Tafolla (2000–2002) * Josh Ramos (2002–2009, 2012–2018) * JJ Links (2003–2004) * Thorsten Koehne (2011–2012) ====Bass==== * Todd Jensen (1991–1992) * Christopher Maloney (2001–2002) * Bob Burch (2002, live only) * Rudy Sarzo (2004) * Jamie Brown (2005–2009) ====Keyboards==== * Michael T.

It was built between 1924 and 1929 by RWE AG, to transport electricity produced in the hydro-electric power plants in Vorarlberg, Austria and the southern Black Forest to the Ruhr district. The line begins in Bludenz and in Herbertingen connects with a second line, which comes from Tiengen. It continues to the transformer stations at Ludwigsburg- Hoheneck, Mannheim-Rheinau, Kelsterbach, Koblenz, and Bad Neuenahr to Brauweiler. The entire line was originally installed on pylons with a three- tiered arrangement. With the exception of the Kelsterbach–Koblenz and Heilbronn–Neckarwestheim sections of the line, the North–South Powerline is still carried by the original masts. For the section which travels through Bad Neuenahr, Koblenz, Kelsterbach, Mannheim/Rheinau and Ludwigsburg/Hoheneck, C1-pylons are used; in other sections, C2 and C3 pylons are used, depending upon the need for the lines to withstand loads of ice during the winter. Due to uprating of one circuit, most pylons in the south part are still asymmetrical. In 1964, an electric circuit of the section traveling through Ludwigsburg/Hoheneck, Herbertingen and Tiengen switched over to 380 kV. In the section between the transformer stations Ludwigsburg–Hoheneck and Mannheim/Rheinau, an electric circuit was deemed to be dispensable in the year 2003. The two lowest conductors on this section of the line were dismantled between 10 November and 16 December 2003, to make better use of the land beneath the line route. The dispensable fourth conductor on the masts was left as an anchor. Ludwigsburg-Hoheneck station was built for the line and is one of the oldest and biggest stations in Germany. To make space for the fourth runway of Frankfurt Airport, the section around Kelsterbach was removed in 2008. ==External links== * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b57808 * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b57805 * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b57806 * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b57807 Category:Electric power infrastructure in Austria Category:Electric power transmission systems in Germany ","title":"North–South Powerline"},{"id":"2001868","text":"The front cover of The Demon Headmaster. The Demon Headmaster is a series of books by Gillian Cross which were later adapted as a television series starring Terrence Hardiman in the title role and Frances Amey as Dinah. The title character is a strange being with the powers of hypnosis and a desire to take over the world, as he believes it will be better under his ordered rule. He has piercing light green eyes, which he normally hides behind dark-tinted glasses - removing these in order to hypnotise his victims. Very little about the Demon Headmaster or his background is shown in the books. His name is never revealed; he is referred to only as 'the Headmaster' both in the books and on television, except when he takes on an alias - such as the Computer Director in The Prime Minister's Brain, and on each occasion he uses a title rather than a name. ==Reading order== *The Demon Headmaster - *The Prime Minister's Brain - *The Revenge of the Demon Headmaster - *The Demon Headmaster Strikes Again - *The Demon Headmaster Takes Over - *Facing the Demon Headmaster - *Beware of the Demon Headmaster - (a short story about the Demon Headmaster, without the other characters) *Total Control - *Mortal Danger - ==BooksThe Demon Headmaster=== First Published in 1982.The Demon Headmaster by Gillian Cross book review | Yakbooks Dinah Glass moves in with Lloyd and Harvey Hunter and at first does not like them. Soon she discovers that at her new school, the Headmaster is very strange and she finds herself saying things like, \\"I think the Headmaster is a marvellous man and this is the best school I've ever been to\\". With the help of her new friends, SPLAT, (Society for the Protection of our Lives Against Them, the children at the school who are immune to the Demon Headmaster's hypnotic powers), she successfully stops the Headmaster's plot to hypnotise the country through the Eddy Hair Television Show and she gets adopted by the Hunters. This became the first three episodes of the first series of the television adaptation. ===The Prime Minister's Brain=== First published in 1985 as Return of the Demon Headmaster. Dinah wins a place in the final of a computer competition, and she and SPLAT go to the finals. Little does she realise that the computer competition is a plot by the Demon Headmaster to take over the world, by hacking into the Prime Minister's computer (The Prime Minister's Brain) and hypnotizing the Prime Minister, thus allowing him to meet the other world leaders and gain control of them himself. This became the last three episodes of the first series of the television adaptation. (Later republished as The Demon Headmaster and the Prime Minister's Brain following the success of the television series.) ===The Revenge of the Demon Headmaster=== First published in 1994 as \\"Hunky Parker is Watching You\\" Gillian Cross - Literature When Ingrid turns up at a SPLAT meeting she is raving about Hunky Parker, a new TV show. It's the latest craze, she says, and soon everyone will be hooked. The other SPLAT members disagree until Ingrid shows them her Hunky video, which Dinah eventually realises is due to subliminal messages in the tape. Tracking the source of Hunky Parker merchandise, SPLAT learns that it has been created by the Demon Headmaster, attempting to trigger riots for new merchandise that he can use to exert his control over the populace. ===The Demon Headmaster Strikes Again=== First published in 1996.Editions of The Demon Headmaster Strikes Again by Gillian Cross Dinah's father is headhunted for a new job at the Biogenetic Research Centre, unaware that the Demon Headmaster is the director. This time his lust for power sees him meddling with evolution itself. He has created an Evolution Accelerator: a machine to speed up the evolution process and produce the perfect human, beginning with the development of a fast-growing poisonous creeper that attacks Lloyd. But for this, he needs Dinah's DNA - combining it with a lizard to create Eve, a human/lizard hybrid who possesses Dinah's intellect but lacks her emotions - and then put her into terrible danger, pitting her against Eve to test his theories. This became series two of the television adaptation. ===The Demon Headmaster Takes Over=== First published 1997 When the army starts dismantling the research centre, Dinah contacts Professor Claudia Rowe, an expert on botanical sciences who has expressed an interest in the creeper. Then weird things start to happen. Libraries start closing and their books are taken away. Telephones stop working, and there is no internet access. People start talking like robots, even Claudia Rowe, and more and more of the population seem to be wearing strange badges. Dinah's search leads her to the university where she finds the mysterious Director developing \\"Hyperbrain\\", a computer with superhuman intelligence and deadly potential. SPLAT swiftly realises that, although the original Headmaster was killed when he fell into the Evolution Accelerator, the machine still recorded his DNA and was thus able to create a clone, lacking the originals memories but retaining his lust for control. This became the third and final series of the television adaptation. ===Facing the Demon Headmaster=== First published 2002Facing the Demon Headmaster by Gillian Cross book review | Yakbooks The new club Purple is the place to go - if you can get in - and Mandy's cousin, Ellie, persuades Dinah and her friends to come along too. The man everyone wants to see is DJ Pardoman whose face keeps changing from Elvis to Madonna to Brad Pitt. His electronic mask is mesmerising but no one knows who he really is. When the kids visit his website they find an online competition: the person who finds out DJ Pardoman's true identity will be allowed to lift off the mask. Dinah, thinking the whole setup strange, joins in out of curiosity. In her search she stumbles across something amazing: her real father might be alive after years of thinking he was dead. Dinah must find out more. But she only realises the truth of these strange coincidences too late. This time the Demon Headmaster is intent on ensuring that Dinah will not interfere with his plans. ===Total Control=== First published 2017 The story continues with a new group of children, in a new school, without SPLAT's members. The stories centers on Lizzie, her younger brother, their friend Ethan and Angelika. Lizzie and her brother return from the United States, where their mother had surgery. After returning to their school, they realize that the school has a new headmaster and the students are showing exceptional talents, even their bully enemy Blake. However Lizzie suddenly starts to behave aggressive against the school, her brother becomes a robotics genius and their recent made friend Ethan becomes a soccer star. But when they try to talk, or even think about those sudden changes, their minds goes blank. Ethan eventually discover that the Headmaster is hypnotizing and controlling everybody in the school. They team up with Angelika (a girl who suddenly became a coffee business enthusiast) and even Blake (who became a Multilingual greeter) and discovers the great plot of The Headmaster to show to the Prime Minister the great results of the school, thus allowing The Headmaster to administrate others school. ===Mortal Danger=== First published 2019 ===Short stories=== In 1998, Puffin Books released a series of goody bags on certain themes and featured a notepad, pencil, rubber, etc., along with a small book. In the 'Fantasy' goody bag there was a book calling 'Crash Landing & Other Stories' by Gillian Cross. This book contains three short stories about the Demon Headmaster or people similar to him. The first story, called 'Crash Landing', is set at some point after The Prime Minister's Brain, and is about the Demon Headmaster crashing his getaway helicopter in a small village, although he is identified only as 'the Visitor'. It features SPLAT-type characters, including a lead named Charity who actually reads the Demon Headmaster books in the story, Charity defeating the Headmaster by using mirrored sunglasses to trick him into hypnotising himself. The second story, called Carnival!, doesn't explicitly identify one of its characters as the Demon Headmaster, but from the illustrations and description are meant to make it obvious that it is him. The third story is called 'Maths Homework', and features a teacher referred to as Old Webster. This isn't the Demon Headmaster but is a very similar character. The introduction to the story says, 'Maybe you think you have spotted the Demon Headmaster somewhere. Are you sure? Things aren't always what they seem.' In the front of the book it says that 'Crash Landing' was first published in Shark And Chips And Other Stories, and that 'Carnival' was published in the Young Telegraph in 1996. The third story is not mentioned. ==CharactersDinah Glass Hunter=== Dinah is the main protagonist in the story The Demon Headmaster by Gillian Cross. She arrives in the story at the Hunters' house as a foster child, having been orphaned at an early age and brought up in a children's home. She is extraordinarily intelligent, but she normally keeps this quiet. Her intelligence causes the Headmaster to take an interest in her, and makes her pivotal in his plans to win a national school quiz competition for nefarious ends, as well as other subsequent plots, made easier by the fact that she is the only member of SPLAT not immune to his hypnosis. At the end of the first story, Dinah is adopted by the Hunter family and becomes Dinah Hunter. ===Lloyd Hunter=== Lloyd is the founder and leader of the Society for the Protection of our Lives Against Them, or SPLAT as it's known. Lloyd is one of only five children in the entire school whom the Headmaster is unable to hypnotize. Lloyd comes across as arrogant and cocky at times and also isn't the brightest kid at school unlike his now proper sister, Dinah, but Lloyd has shown on more than one occasion he is by no means stupid and is a more than capable leader of SPLAT even though he does come across as bossy and hates people stealing his thunder. Lloyd at first is very hostile towards Dinah and also takes the longest to accept her out of all the members of SPLAT, but eventually he is the first to suggest that his and Harvey's parents adopt Dinah. ===Harvey Hunter=== Harvey is a pleasant laid-back boy, very different to his older brother, Lloyd. It's clear he is very close to Lloyd, possibly because Lloyd has always looked out for him at school and helped him stay out of trouble with the Headmaster. Harvey accepts Dinah into the family and SPLAT a lot quicker than Lloyd and the others do, and soon is as close to his new sister as he is his brother. Harvey seems to understand Dinah more than Lloyd does and is more prepared to listen to her. ===Ian=== Ian acts as Lloyd's second-in-command in SPLAT. Ian, like Harvey, is very laid back and very much the joker of SPLAT. Ian will often break any tension with a well-timed joke and acts as a good foil to the more serious Lloyd. ===Mandy=== Mandy is one of the more mature members of SPLAT and seems to be the motherly influence in the society. She is the best at soothing people like Lloyd and Ingrid when they get in a temper, and is generally the most level-headed of the gang, although she is not above making the odd snide remark when Lloyd's plans backfire. ===Ingrid=== Ingrid is the youngest member of SPLAT, but she's no pushover. Ingrid is generally the most childish member of SPLAT, prone to sulking when things don't go her way or the others don't listen to her. The fact that she's the youngest does mean that she is generally ignored if she makes a suggestion, although nine times out of ten she'll be right. ===The Demon Headmaster=== The Headmaster is the main antagonist of the series. He can turn almost anyone into a hypnotic state by having them look into his eyes, except for a few who seem to be naturally immune, among them Ingrid, Mandy, Harvey, Lloyd and Ian. He has a fixation with order and control, attempting to eliminate chaos even if that means basically depriving people of emotion, and has demonstrated a strong desire to enforce that control on others. In the course of the novels he has either established or infiltrated such diverse organisations as a school, a computer lab, a television studio, a genetics research facility, a university, and even a night club, with the goal of using his contacts in these businesses to enforce his will on the world. The original Headmaster was killed at the conclusion of The Demon Headmaster Strikes Again when he fell into his own evolution accelerator machine by accident, but the machine was later accidentally activated to create a clone of the Headmaster, who was able to learn about the world from the material in the research centre. As a result, the 'new' Headmaster retains the original's desire for control and hypnotic abilities, but completely failed to recognise Lloyd, only identifying Dinah because he found a video recording of her talking to his 'predecessor'. ==Television adaptations== In 1996, the Demon Headmaster books were adapted by the BBC to make a television series based on the books. The series proved popular with children and ran for three series from 2 January 1996 to 22 January 1998. The first series contained six episodes, and aired twice weekly from 2 to 18 January 1996, the second series contained seven episodes, and aired once a week from 25 September to 6 November 1996, and the third series contained six episodes, and aired twice weekly from 6 to 22 January 1998. The first series of the show was split into two distinctive story lines, with the first three episodes adapted from the first book in the series \\"The Demon Headmaster\\" and the last three were adapted from the second book \\"The Demon Headmaster and the Prime Minister's Brain\\". The second series was adapted from the fourth book \\"The Demon Headmaster Strikes Again\\". The third and final series was adapted from the fifth book \\"The Demon Headmaster Takes Over\\". In 2019, CBBC broadcast a new adaptation, later revealed as a sequel to the previous show, from the book Total Control. It aired from Monday October 14 with the pilot episode, everystudentastar, adapted and showrun by Emma Reeves. Hardiman returned as the original Demon Headmaster in the first season's final episode, where he forced his 'successor' to stand down when their plans were thwarted, albeit only appearing as a hologram of himself rather than in person. Reeves has pitched a second series to CBBC, using further elements of Total Control, as well as its sequel, Mortal Danger.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-11-15/demon-headmaster- series-2/ As of January 28 2020, it has not yet been announced if there'll be a renewal. ==Audiobooks== All of the original books in the series are available on audiobook, \\"Beware the Demon Headmaster\\" and the \\"Crash Landing\\" book have yet to be released on Audio. Most of the books in the series are read by Judy Bennett, although Facing the Demon Headmaster is read by Kelly Hunter and not Judy Bennett. Also The Demon Headmaster (the first of the series) was read by Terrence Hardiman and released on cassette. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:Novels by Gillian Cross Category:Novel series Category:British horror novels Category:Fiction about hypnosis Category:Fictional principals and headteachers Category:Fictional hypnotists and indoctrinators ","title":"The Demon Headmaster"},{"id":"2001873","text":"The City of Washington Pipe Band is a grade two pipe band located in Washington, D.C. ==History== The band was formed in 1961 as the Denny & Dunipace Pipe Band, by members of the U.S. Air Force Pipe Band. Unable to compete due to Air Force regulations, members of that band joined with local players to form a Grade Two pipe band in the District of Columbia. Pipe Major Sandy Jones of the Air Force band took over in 1970. In 1985, the band changed its name to The Scottish & Irish Imports Pipe Band due to a sponsorship change, and was upgraded to Grade One. In 1990 Mike Green was named Pipe Major, and after competing under the Denny & Dunipace name during the 1990 season, the band was renamed to the City of Washington Pipe Band to avoid confusion with a new Pipe Band of the same name. In 2007 Dan Lyden was named Pipe Major, and continues the band's tradition of excellent playing on the east coast. Sponsorship from Icelandair allowed the band to compete internationally in the 1990s, and the band was downgraded to conform with international standards. They won Grade Two at the World Pipe Band Championships in 1999, and were subsequently upgraded back to Grade One. Since then, the band has competed internationally in Grade One, coming in 2nd at the North American Pipe Band Championships in Maxville, Ontario in 2000.

A more determinedly pop act than The Fire Engines, they were commercially successful in Scotland, partly due to their single \\"You've Got the Power\\" being used in a lager advertising campaign for Scottish brewers McEwan's. But they were unable to translate that into more widespread success and break through further afield. They released two albums and disbanded in 1990.

The tower was completed in 2000 at a cost of $64 million, and was named after the Fox Theatre that occupied the site from 1911 until the late 1990s. TVA Architects designed the building and Tom Moyer developed the property. ==History== Original designs for the tower included seven floors of above-ground parking. Plans for the above-ground parking levels were removed in 1998 to add space for what was originally to be a movie theater operated by Act III Theaters. The building earned Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in 2012 for its sustainability. ==Details== The building is most notable for the contrast between its curving east side and boxy west side. The juxtaposition of the building's angles create a unique profile from each side. This multiplanar and set-back design is meant to prevent as much of the building's shadow as possible from falling upon Pioneer Courthouse Square on the opposite corner. The ground floor houses retail stores, and Regal's Fox Tower 10 movie theater is located on the second floor. The 462-space underground parking garage was the deepest in Portland when built. In 2006 the Fox Tower's developer, Tom Moyer, started construction of an underground garage on the block to the west, connected to the Fox Tower garage. This new parking structure opened in December 2007 making the total underground parking space count 1132. Because the west block lies slightly uphill from the Fox Tower, the west garage is deeper than the Fox Tower garage, relative to ground level. The new garage is an underground facility, with a City of Portland park on top of the garage. Construction and landscaping for the park was started by the City of Portland in March 2008. The underground parking is also planned to be connected to the Park Avenue West Tower. ==See also== *Architecture of Portland, Oregon * Fox Theatre (Portland, Oregon) *List of tallest buildings in Portland, Oregon *RingSide Steakhouse ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Portland, Oregon Category:Office buildings completed in 2000 Category:Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold certified buildings Category:2000 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Fox Tower"},{"id":"2001878","text":"Clear Channel Building, location of the WNIC studios WNIC (100.3 MHz) is a commercial FM radio station licensed to Dearborn, Michigan and serving the Metro Detroit media market.

With FM radio still in its early stages, the two stations largely simulcast their programming through the 1970s. ===WKNR-FM and top 40 format=== On Halloween 1963, WKMH-AM-FM became WKNR-AM-FM, and legendary Top 40 radio station \\"Keener 13\\" was born, beginning a three-and-a-half-year reign at the top of Detroit's radio ratings until it was toppled by CKLW in nearby Windsor, Ontario, in 1967. WKMH's FM signal at 100.3 chiefly simulcast Keener AM (with automated Top 40 programming during non-simulcast times). In 1969, inspired by the success of groundbreaking progressive rock station 99.5 WABX (now WYCD), WKMH-FM adopted its own progressive rock sound. \\"Uncle\\" Russ Gibb was the WKNR-FM disc jockey who helped to spread the rumor that Paul McCartney was dead. According to Gibb, a college student in Ann Arbor called him on the air one Sunday afternoon and explained the theory to him. The rumor took off from there and generated much publicity for Gibb and WKNR-FM. It was air personality Chris Randall who phoned WABC New York City DJ Roby Yonge. Yonge put the rumor on the air in New York and was responsible for it spreading nationwide. ===\\"Stereo Island\\" and transition to adult contemporary=== 100.3 WNIC Logo 1990-2002 100.3 WNIC Logo 2003–2010WKNR-FM dropped its progressive rock format in 1971 to become \\"Stereo Island,\\" a cross between Beautiful Music and Middle of the Road that could be described as an early form of what would be later be called Soft Adult Contemporary. \\"Stereo Island\\" was successful and spawned imitators such as WFMK in Lansing, Michigan. In 1972, both WKNR and WKNR-FM were sold and became WNIC-AM-FM, simulcasting a straightforward Beautiful Music format. The WNIC call letters were meant to denote the station's \\"NICe\\" music. In 1976, WNIC adopted a more up-tempo sound called \\"Rock 'n' Easy\\", and moved to its current adult contemporary format. WNIC scored its first number-one placing in the monthly Arbitron ratings in Detroit in 1998. ===Fresh 100.3, return to WNIC=== Fresh 100.3 logo 2010–2013 On December 27, 2010, following its annual Christmas music programming and a two- hour \\"music test\\" at 2:00 p.m., WNIC dropped its long-time mainstream AC format and flipped to hot adult contemporary as Fresh 100.3. Clear Channel's Detroit operations manager Todd Thomas stated that the new format was \\"the music that radio listeners in Detroit told us they wanted to hear\\", and \\"a unique sound on 100.3 for 2011 and beyond.\\" The new format was competed primarily with WDVD. In December 2011, WNIC began to backtrack on its format changes, reflected by the amended slogan \\"Variety From Today & Back In The Day\\". The station also adjusted its on-air lineup adding Billy The Kidd for nights. On November 7, 2013, coinciding with the start of the station's annual shift to all Christmas music, WNIC dropped the \\"Fresh\\" branding and returned to using 100.3 WNIC as its on-air brand. While the station continued with its more upbeat format, WNIC has added an increased amount of 1980s and 1990s music and occasionally a 1970s song. WNIC, WOMC, and WDVD gained new competition in November 2018 with the flip of WDZH to soft AC. Four Detroit radio stations now compete for the 25-54 female audience. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *Michiguide.com – WNIC History *Detroit Radio Ratings NIC Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WNIC"},{"id":"2001879","text":"Taba (also known as East Makian or Makian Dalam) is a Malayo-Polynesian language of the South Halmahera–West New Guinea group. It is spoken mostly on the islands of Makian, Kayoa and southern Halmahera in North Maluku province of Indonesia by about 20,000 people.Ethnologue: Makian, East ==Dialects== There are minor differences in dialect between all of the villages on Makian island in which Taba is spoken. Most differences affect only a few words. One of the most widespread reflexes is the use of /o/ in Waikyon and Waigitang, where in other villages /a/ is retained from Proto-South Halmaheran.Bowden 2001, p. 190 ==Geographic distribution== As of 2005, Ethnologue lists Taba as having a speaking population of approximately 20,000, however, it has been argued by linguists that this number could in reality be anywhere between 20,000 and 50,000.Ethnologue: Makian, East The language is predominantly spoken on Eastern Makian island, although it is also found on Southern Mori island, Kayoa islands, Bacan and Obi island and along the west coast of south Halmahera. There has also been continued migration of speakers to other areas of North Maluku due to frequent volcanic eruptions on Makian island.Bowden 2001, p. 5 The island itself is home to two languages: Taba, which is spoken on the eastern side of the island, and a Papuan language spoken on the western side, known alternatively as West Makian or Makian Luar (outer Makian); in Taba, this language is known as Taba Lik (\\"Outer Taba\\"), while its native speakers know it as Moi. ==Speech levels== Taba is divided into three different levels of speech: alus, biasa and kasar. Alus, or ‘refined’ Taba is used in situations in which the speaker is addressing someone older or of greater status than the speaker themselves. Biasa, or ‘ordinary’ Taba, is used in most general situations. The Kasar, or ‘coarse’ form of Taba is used only rarely and generally in anger. ==Phonology== Taba has fifteen indigenous consonant phonemes, and four loan phonemes: . These are shown below: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |+ ConsonantsBowden 2001, p. 26 |- ! !! Bilabial !! Apico-alveolar !! Lamino- palatal !! Dorso-velar !! Glottal |- !

Close | align=center| || || align=center| |- ! Mid | align=center| || || align=center| |- ! Open | || align=center| || |} ==GrammarWord order=== Taba is, predominantly, a head-marking language which adheres to a basic AVO word order. However, there is a reasonable degree of flexibility.Bowden 2001, p. 1 :{| |(1) ||yak||k=ha-lekat||pakakas||ne |- | ||1SG||1SG=CAUS-broken||tool||PROX |- | ||colspan=5| \\"I broke this tool.\\" |} Taba has both prepositions and postpositions. ===Pronouns=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |+ Independent PronounsBowden 2001, p. 188 |- ! rowspan=2 align=center| Person !! colspan=2 align=center| Number |- | align=center| Singular || align=center| Plural |- ! 1INC | || align=center| tit |- ! 1EXCL | align=center| yak || align=center| am |- ! 2 | align=center| au || align=center| meu |- ! 3 | align=center| i || align=center| si |} In Taba, pronouns constitute an independent, closed set. Syntactically, Taba pronouns can be used in any context where a full noun phrase is applicable. However, independent pronouns are only used in reference to animate entities, unless pronominal reference to inanimate Patients is required in reflexive clauses.Bowden 2001, p. 190 As mentioned, independent pronouns are generally used for animate reference. However, there are two exceptions to this generalisation. In some circumstances an inanimate is considered a 'higher inanimate' which accords syntactic status similar to animates. This is represented as in English where inanimates such as cars or ships, for example, can be ascribed a gender. This is illustrated below in a response to the question 'Why did the Taba Jaya (name of a boat) stop coming to Makian?': {| |(1) |Ttumo |i |te |ndara |- | |t=tum-o |i |te |ndara |- | |1pl.incl=follow- APPL |3sg |NEG |too.much |- | |'We didn't catch it enough.' | | | |} The Taba Jaya, a boat significant enough to be given a name, is accorded pronoun status similar to animates. The other exception occurs in reflexive clauses where a pronominal copy of a reflexive Patient is required, as shown below: {| |(2) |Bonci |ncayak |i |tadia |- | |bonci |n-say-ak |i |ta-dia |- | |peanut |3sg- spread-APPL |3sg |SIM-REM |- | | colspan=\\"4\\" |'Peanut (leaves) spread out on itself like that.' |} Non-human animates and inanimates are always grammatically singular, regardless of how many referents are involved. In Taba, pronouns and noun phrases are marked by Person and Number. ===Person=== Taba distinguishes three Persons in the pronominal and cross-referencing systems. Person is marked on both pronouns and on cross-referencing proclitics attached to verb phrases. The actor cross-referencing proclitics are outlined in the following table.Bowden 2001, p. 194 In the first Person plural, a clusivity distinction is made, 'inclusive' (including the addressee) and 'exclusive' (excluding the addressee), as is common to most Austronesian languages. {| class=\\"wikitable\\" ! colspan=\\"4\\" |Cross-referencing proclitics |- |1sg |k= |1 pl.incl 1 pl.excl |t= a= |- |2sg |m= |2 pl |h= |- |3sg |n= |3 pl |l= |} The following are examples of simple Actor intransitive clauses showing each of the proclitic prefixes. This is an example of first Person singular (inclusive); {| |(3) |yak |kwom |- | |yak |k=wom |- | |1sg |1sg=come |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'I've come' |} second Person singular; {| |(4) |Au |mwom |- | |au |m=wom |- | |2sg |2sg=come |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'You've come. (you singular)' |} third Person singular; {| |(5) |I |nwom |- | |i |n=wom |- | |3sg |3sg=come |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'S/he's come.' |} first Person plural (inclusive); {| |(6) |Tit |twom |- | |tit |t=wom |- | |1pl.incl |1pl.incl=come |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'We've come. (You and I)' |} first Person plural (exclusive); {| |(7) |Am |awom |- | |am |a=wom |- | |1pl.excl |1pl.excl=come |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'We've come. (myself and one or more other people but not you)' |} second Person plural; and {| |(8) |Meu |hwom |- | |meu |h=wom |- | |2pl |2pl=come |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'You've come. (you plural)' |} third Person plural; {| |(9) |Si |lwom |- | |si |l=wom |- | |3pl |3pl=come |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'They've come.' |} The alternation between proclitic markers indicates Number, where in (3) k= denotes the arrival of a singular Actor, while in (7) a= indicates the arrival of first Person plural Actors, exclusionary of the addressee, and is replicated in the change of prefix in the additional examples. ===Number=== Number is marked on noun phrases and pronouns. Taba distinguishes grammatically between singular and plural categories, as shown in (3) to (9) above. Plural marking is obligatory for humans and is used for all noun phrases which refer to multiple individuals. Plurality is also used to indicate respect in the second and third Person when addressing or speaking of an individual who is older than the speaker. The rules for marking Number on noun phrases are summarised in the table below: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" |Marking Number |- ! !singular !plural |- |human |Used for one person when person is same age or younger than speaker. |Used for one person when person is older than speaker. Used for more than one person in all contexts. |- |non-human animate |Used no matter how many referents |Not used |- |inanimate |Used no matter how many referents |Not used |} The enclitic =si marks Number in noun phrases. =si below (10), indicates that there is more than one child playing on the beach and, in (11), the enclitic indicates that the noun phase mama lo baba, translated as 'mother and father,' is plural. {| |(10) ||Wangsi||lalawa||lawe||solo||li |- | |wang=si |l=ha=lawa |la-we |solo |li |- | ||child=PL||3pl=CAUS-play||sea-ESS||beach||LOC |- | | colspan=\\"5\\" |'The children are playing on the beach.' |- |} {| |(11) |Nim |mama |li |babasi |laoblak |- |||nim||mama||lo||baba=si||l-ha=obal-k |- | ||2SG.POSS||mother||and||father=PL||3PL=CAUS-call-APPL |- | | colspan=\\"5\\" |'Your mother and father are calling you.' |} Plural Number is used as a marker of respect not only for second Person addressees, but for third Person referents as seen in (12). In Taba, it has been observed that many adults use deictic shifts towards the perspective of addressee children regarding the use of plural markers. Example (13) is typical of an utterance of an older person than those they are referring to, indicative of respect that should be accorded to the referent by the addressee. {| |(12) |Ksung |Om |Nur |nidi |um |li |- | |k=sung |Om |Nur |nidi |um |li |- | |1sg=enter |Uncle |Nur |3pl.POSS |house |LOC |- | | colspan=\\"6\\" |'I went into Om Nur's house.' |} {| |(13) |Nim |babasi |e |lo |li |e? |- | |nim |baba=si |e |lo |li |e |- | |2sg.POSS |father=PL |FOC |where |LOC |FOC |- | | colspan=\\"6\\" |'Where is your father?' |} ==== Pronominal affixes ==== All Taba verbs having Actor arguments carry affixes which cross-reference the Number and Person of the Actor, examples of proclitics are shown above. In Taba, there are valence-changing affixes which deal with patterns of cross-referencing with three distinct patterns. The dominant pattern is used with all verbs having an Actor argument. The other two patterns are confined to a small number of verbs: one for the possessive verb, the other for a few verbs of excretion. This is discussed further in Possession below. ===Possession=== Taba does not, as such, have possessive pronouns. Rather, the possessor noun and the possessed entity are linked by a possessive ligature. The Taba ligatures are shown below: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |+ Possessive ParticlesBowden 2001, p. 187 |- ! rowspan=2 align=center| Person !! colspan=2 align=center| Number |- | align=center| Singular || align=center| Plural |- ! 1INC | || align=center| nit |- ! 1EXCL | align=center| nik || align=center|am |- ! 2 | align=center| nim || align=center| meu |- ! 3 | align=center| ni || align=center| nidi/di |} ====Adnominal possession==== Adnominal possession involves the introduction of an inflected possessive particle between the possessor and the possessed entity; this inflected possessive, formally categorised as a ‘ligature’, is cross-referenced with the number and person of the possessor. This ligature indicates a possessive relationship between a modifier noun and its head-noun. In Taba, adnominal possession is distinguished by reverse genitive ordering, in which the possessor noun precedes the noun referring to the possessed entity.Bowden 2001, p. 230 In many contexts the possessor will not be overtly referenced. Example of reverse genitive ordering in Taba: :{| |(12) ||ni||mtu |- | ||3SG.POSS||child |- | ||colspan=5| \\"His/her child.\\" |} ====Obligatory possessive marking==== In Taba, alienable and inalienable possession is not obligatorily marked by the use of different forms, though this is common in many related languages. However, there are a number of seemingly inalienable entities which cannot be referred to without referencing a possessor.Bowden 2001, p. 233 For example: :{| |(13) ||meja ||ni||wwe |- | ||table ||3SG.POSS||leg |- | ||colspan=5| \\"The leg (of the table).\\" |} ====Verbal possession==== Verbal possession in Taba is generally indicated through the attaching of the causative prefix ha- to the adnominal possessive forms. The possessor then becomes actor of the clause, and the possessed entity becomes the undergoer.Bowden 2001, p. 197 This method of forming a possessive verb is very unusual, typologically, and is found in almost no other languages.Bowden 2001, p. 239 :{| |(14) ||kabin||da||yak||k=ha-nik |- | ||goat||DIST||1SG||1SG=CAUS-1SG.POSS |- | ||colspan=5| \\"That goat, I own it.\\" |} === Negation === Like other Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages spoken in the Maluku Islands, Taba uses different particles to negate declarative and imperative clauses;Florey 2010, p. 246 declaratives are negated using te, while imperatives are negated using oik.Bowden 2001, p. 335 In both cases the negative particles are clause-final, a placement which is posited to be the result of contact with non-Austronesian Papuan languages.Florey 2010, p. 248; Reesink 2002, p. 246 ==== Negation of declaratives using te ==== Declarative clauses are negated using the particle te, which follows all other elements of the clause except for modal and aspectual particles (these are discussed below).Bowden 2001, pp. 335-336 Examples (15a) and (15b) show negation of an Actor intransitive clause, while (16a) and (16b) give negation of a non-Actor bivalent clause (i.e. a clause with two Undergoer arguments); te has the same clause-final placement regardless of the clause structure. {| |(15a) |Nhan |akla |- | |n=han |ak-la |- | |3sg=go |ALL-sea |- | | colspan=\\"2\\" |'She's going seawards.' (Bowden 2001, p. 335) |} {| |(15b) |Nhan |akla |te |- | |n=han |ak-la |te |- | |3sg=go |ALL-sea |NEG |- | | colspan=\\"3\\" |'She's not going seawards.' (Bowden 2001, p. 335) |} {| |(16a) |Nik |calana |kudak |asfal |- | |nik |ak-lacalana |kuda-k |asfal |- | |1sg.POSS |trousers |be.black-APPL |bitumen |- | | colspan=\\"4\\" |'My trousers are blackened with bitumen.' (Bowden 2001, p. 336) |} {| |(16b) |Nik |calana |kudak |asfal |te |- | |nik |ak-lacalana |kuda-k |asfal |te |- | |1sg.POSS |trousers |be.black-APPL |bitumen |NEG |- | | colspan=\\"5\\" |'My trousers are not blackened with bitumen.' (Bowden 2001, p. 336) |} Negation of complex sentences can be ambiguous — see example (17), where te can operate on either just the complement clause khan 'I'm going' or to the whole clause complex kalusa khan 'I said I'm going':Bowden 2001, p. 336 {| |(17) |Kalusa |khan |te |- | |k=ha-lusa |k=han |te |- | |1sg=CAUSE-say |1sg=go |NEG |- | | colspan=\\"3\\" |'I said I'm not going.' / 'I didn't say I'm going.' (Bowden 2001, p. 335) |} Negative existential clauses te can serve as the predicator of a negative existential clause, with no verb required. It can occur immediately following the noun phrase that refers to whatever is being asserted as non- existent, as in (18): {| |(18) |Nik |dalawat |te |- | |nik |dalawat |te |- | |1sg.POSS |girlfriend |NEG |- | | colspan=\\"3\\" |'I don't have a girlfriend.' (Bowden 2001, p. 336) |} However, a discourse marker is generally interposed between the noun phrase and te. This marker expresses something about how the non-existence of the noun phrase's referent relates to the discourse context, or alternatively indicates the speaker's attitude towards the proposition. In (19), the discourse marker mai (glossed as 'but') is used to indicate that the non-existence of tea, sugar and coffee in the household described by the speaker is counter to one's expectations that a normal household would have these items: {| |(19) |Te |mai |te; |gula |mai |te; |kofi |mai |te |- | |tea |but |NEG |sugar |but |NEG |coffee |but |NEG |- | | colspan=\\"9\\" |'There's no tea; there's no sugar; there's no coffee.' (Bowden 2001, p. 336) |} Complex negative modal / aspectual particlesBowden 2001, pp. 337-339 Taba has three complex negative particles which, in addition to negation, express mood or aspect; these are formed by the modal and aspectual particles attaching onto te as clitics. The three particles are tedo (realis negative), tehu (continuative negative), and tesu (potential negative). tedo (realis negative)Bowden 2001, pp. 337-338 tedo is a compound of te and the realis mood marker do, and expresses a more emphatic negation than plain te. In (20), it is used to emphasize the absolute nature of the prohibition against making alcohol in the Muslim community of the speaker: {| |(20) |Mai |ane |lpeik |saguer |tedo. |- | |mai |a-ne |l=pe-ik |saguer |te-do |- | |but |DEM-PROX |3pl=make-APPL |palm.wine |NEG-REAL |- | | colspan=\\"5\\" |'But here they don't make palm wine with it anymore.' (Bowden 2001, p. 338) |} tehu (continuative negative)Bowden 2001, p. 338 tehu is a compound of te and the continuous aspect marker hu, and can be roughly translated as 'not up to the relevant point in time': this may be either the time of utterance (i.e. 'not yet', 'still not'), or some other time relevant to the context of the utterance, as in (21). Unlike the potential negative tesu, tehu does not express any expectations about the likelihood of the negated event or state occurring in the future. {| |(21) |Manganco |ne |dukon |tehu |- | |manganco |ne |dukon |te- hu |- | |long.time |PROX |eruption |NEG-CONT |- | | colspan=\\"4\\" |'For a long time there hadn't been an eruption.' (Bowden 2001, p. 338) |} tehu also often appears at the end of the first clause in a sequence of clauses, indicating whatever is referred to by the first clause has not still occurred by the time of the event(s) or state(s) referred to by the following clauses. {| |(22) |Karna |taplod |tehu, |manusia |loas |do. |- | |karna |ta-plod |te-hu |manusia |l=oas |do |- | |because |DETR-erupt |NEG-CONT |people |3pl=flee |REAL |- | | colspan=\\"6\\" |'Because the mountain had still not erupted when everyone fled.' (Bowden 2001, p. 338) |} tesu (potential negative)Bowden 2001, pp. 338-339 tesu is formed by suffixing -su, expressing the potential mood, to te. Although tesu is similar to tehu in that it encodes the meaning 'not up to the relevant point in time', it also expresses an expectation that the event referred to will occur in the future: this expectation is made explicit in the free translation of (23). {| |(23) |Sedi |ne |dumik |tesu |- | |sedi |ne |dumik |te-su |- | |garden.shelter |PROX |be.complete |NEG-POT |- | | colspan=\\"4\\" |'This garden shelter is not yet finished.' [but I expect it to be finished later] (Bowden 2001, p. 339) |} tesu shares with tehu the ability to be used at the end of the first clause in a sequence of clauses, and also carries a similar meaning of incompletion; in addition, it encodes the expectation that the event referred to by the first clause should have happened by the event(s) of the following clauses. This expectation does not need to have actually been fulfilled; the breakfast that was expected to be cooked in the first clause of (24) was, in reality, never cooked due to the ensuing eruption. {| |(24) |Hadala |mosa |tesu, |taplod |haso |nak. |- | |hadala |mosa |te-su |ta-plod |ha=so |nak |- | |breakfast |be.cooked |NEG-POT |DETR-erupt |CLASS=one |also |- | | colspan=\\"6\\" |'Breakfast was still not cooked (although I had every expectation that it would be) when it erupted again.' (Bowden 2001, p. 339) |} Unlike the modal and aspectual markers which are used to form the other complex negative particles, su is not attested as a free morpheme elsewhere; however, it is likely related to the optional final -s of the modal verb -ahate(s) 'to be unable', which appears to be derived historically from te having fused onto the verb -ahan 'to be able'.Bowden 2001, pp. 316-318 When used with a final -s, as in (25b) compared with (25a), this modal verb encodes the same meanings expressed by tesu: {| |(25a) |Irianti |nasodas |nahate |- | |Irianti |n=ha-sodas |n=ahate |- | |Irianti |3sg=CAUS-suck[smoke] |3sg=be.unable |- | | colspan=\\"3\\" |'Irianti is not allowed to smoke.' (Bowden 2001, p. 317) |} {| |(25b) |Iswan |nasodas |nahates |- | |Iswan |n=ha-sodas |n=ahate-s |- | |Iswan |3sg=CAUS-suck[smoke] |3sg=be.unable-POT |- | | colspan=\\"3\\" |'Iswan is not allowed to smoke (now. But he will be allowed to in the future).' (Bowden 2001, p. 318) |} ==== Negation of imperatives using oik ==== Imperative clauses are negated using the admonitive particle oik. This particle appears to be derived from a verb oik 'to leave something behind'; however, this verb requires Actor cross- referencing, whereas the particle is never cross-referenced.Bowden 2001, p. 337 Bowden (2001) posits that the imperative use of oik has developed from the use of the independent verb in serial verb constructions, with the morphological elements being lost in the process of grammaticalization.Bowden 2001, p. 369 The particle is shown in (26), while the verbal use (with cross- referencing) is shown in (27): {| |(26) |Hmomas |meu |komo |mai |hmomsak |meu |calana |oik |- | |h=momas |meu |komo |mai |h=momas=ak |meu |calana |oik |- | |2pl=wipe |2pl.POSS |hand |but |2pl=wipe=APPL |2pl.POSS |trousers |ADMON |- | | colspan=\\"8\\" |'Wipe your hands, but don't wipe them with your trousers.' (Bowden 2001, p. 337) |} {| |(27) |Nim |suka |moik |nim |sagala |ane? |- | |nim |suka |m=oik |nim |sagala |a-ne |- | |2sg.POSS |desire |2sg=leave.behind |2sg.POSS |stuff |LOC-PROX |- | | colspan=\\"6\\" |'Do you want to leave your stuff behind here?' (Bowden 2001, p. 337) |} ==== Using negative particles as question tags ==== Yes-no (polar) questions can be posed with either positive or negative polarity; positive polarity questions operate in much the same way as in English, while negative polarity questions, which are formed using forms of the negative marker te as question tags, work in a different manner.Bowden 2001, p. 356 An example of a positive polarity question is given below in (28a), while (28b) shows a negative polarity question: {| |(28a) |Masodas |pa |ne? |- | |m=ha-sodas |pa |ne |- | |2sg=CAUS-suck |or |PROX |- | | colspan=\\"3\\" |'Do you smoke?' (Bowden 2001, p. 356) |} {| |(28b) |Masodas |pa |te? |- | |m=ha-sodas |pa |te |- | |2sg=CAUS-suck |or |NEG |- | | colspan=\\"3\\" |'Do you smoke or not?' (Bowden 2001, p. 356) |} The answers to the positive polarity may be either Jou/Ole (Yes, I do smoke) or Te (No, I don't smoke); when responding to the negative polarity question, the answers are either Jou/Ole (Yes, I do not smoke), Te (No, I do smoke). ==Name taboo (Aroah)== As is common with many Melanesian people, Taba speakers practice ritual name taboo. As such, when a person dies in a Taba community, their name may not be used by any person with whom they had a close connection. This practice adheres to the Makianese belief that, if the names of the recently deceased are uttered, their spirits may be drastically disturbed. The deceased may be referred to simply as ‘Deku’s mother’ or ‘Dula’s sister’. Others in the community with the same name as the deceased will be given maronga, or substitute names.Bowden 2001, p. 22 ==Notes References == * * * Category:South Halmahera–West New Guinea languages Category:Languages of Indonesia Category:Halmahera ","title":"Taba language"},{"id":"2001884","text":"The material culture of the Manasir is very basic and primarily relies on the by-products of palm tree cultivation (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). Date trees not only constitute the main source of income and an important supply of nutrition in Dar al-Manasir, but the Manasir also make intelligent use of all different parts of the palm tree. From it they produce diverse household items, garden tools and building material for their traditional mud houses. (cf. Architecture in Dar al-Manasir). What follows is a list of raw materials gathered from the date palm and the products that can be manufactured from them. ==Garidah (جريدة)== Garidah is the midrib part of the palm leaf. In order to be used as a raw material the Garidah is stripped of its leaflets and spikes and its broad petiole is removed. Garidat are an esteemed raw material for the production of robust containers and furniture. Qafas (قفص) Garidah used for roofing The Manasir use it to manufacture small boxes (Sunduq, صندوق) in which they carry vegetables to the weekly market at Suq Salamat (سوق سلمات). Additionally, Garidah is a good fencing material used for making small hutches called Qafas (قفص) to protect the chicken against wild animals. The Manasir also use it as roofing material to thatch their traditional mud houses (Galus, جالوص). \\\\---- ==Sa'fah (سعفة)== Sa'fat are the leaflets of palm leaves and the most important raw material for a variety of household items including baskets for use in gardening. Household items of particular cultural and practical significance are woven mats called Burush (sing. Birsh, برش). Mats that are called Segagah (سجاجة) are two ells wide and are laid out on the traditional beds called 'Anqarib (عنقريب). A plain uncoloured Segagah is kept aside in every household to be used for washing and carrying the body of a deceased. A second type of Segagah is dyed in different colours and laid out by the bride groom during bridal night and further marriage festivities. It is reused for the period of forty days (ربع) after a woman has given birth and during which she is not supposed to leave the house. 'Anqarib (عنقريب) and Birsh Ruba'i (برش رباعي) uncoloured Segagah (سجاجة) coloured Segagah (سجاجة) A different kind of Birsh can be found in many households and in community places such as the guest house (Madeifah, مضيفة) of the village. It is four ells long and will be rolled out on the floor during banquets or for prayers. It is called Birsh Ruba'i (برش رباعي). The best Burush are woven from the leaves of Mishriq palm trees prominent for their soft and flexible leaflets, although leaflets of other varieties are added for higher durability (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). Old Burush are reused for mending holes in the ceiling or for supporting small window openings in the rooms. Nutu' (نطع) hanging on the kitchen wall Manasir Woman demonstrating her Dukhan (دخّان) Another very specific mat has a circular shape with a central hole the size of a head. It is called Nutu' (نطع). Once a week most Manasir women apply a \\"smoke mask\\" called Dukhan (دخّان) to their face and body. They burn the wood of Acacia seyal (Talh; طلح) in the kitchen hearth or a buried earthen pot in the courtyard. When the burning wood starts to produce smoke the woman will place herself on the Nutu' above the hole, covered by a big piece of coarse fabric and fumigate parts of her body until the upper skin peels off. As a result of this weekly procedure the colour of her skin will appear more pale (cf. CROWFOOT 1918:127-128). The Dukhan can also be used for medical purposes burning additional wood of Acacia ehrenbergiana (Salam; سلم) and Balanites aegyptiaca (Higlig; حجليج). Mi'laq (معلاق) in the doorway Mi'laq (معلاق) hanging from a beam One very common household item made from palm leaflets is the Mi'laq (معلاق), also called Mishle'ib (مشلعيب). It is a simple loop big enough to hold a food container. It is made from two crossed straps of plaited palm leaflets. The Mi'laq is hanging freely from the ceiling, from wooden beams in the courtyard or in doorways. It is a simple and effective local utensil to protect small quantities of food from animals. Another storage device made from palm leaflets is the Shedifah (شدفة), a tightly plaited container for storing sorghum (Dhurah or 'Ayish, ذرة or عيّش). For their work on the fields the Manasir generally rely on a minimum of equipment. The most important and much diversified objects are baskets made from palm leaflets. A multitude of different sizes with somehow similar shapes are in use, each type of basket meant for certain materials to be carried in. The Quffah (قفّة) is the most common basket and used for carrying dates and clothes. The Kunshibr (كونشبر) is a slightly smaller basket in which earth (Turab, تراب) and manure (Maruq; ماروق) are transported (cf. NICHOLLS 1918:24). A proper builder and cultivator (Turbal, تربال – both working with mud and therefore not further distinguished by the Manasir) is expected to employ his own Kunshibr. Ghutaiah (غتاية) The Ghutaiah (غتاية) is another very common small basket used to carry dates and seeds. Its size is exactly defined, since this basket is used as a local measurement for sorghum. Ghutaiat are exceptionally tightly plaited from leaflets of Gau palm trees (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al- Manasir). The Saqataiah (سقتاية) is a multipurpose basket, its size in-between a Quffah and a Ghutaiah (سقتاية لاها قفّة ولاها غتاية). Quffah (قفّة), Kunshibr (كونشبر) and Ghutaiah (غتاية) Special baskets are used for mounting on animals. The Bedouin Manasir have large containers for transporting sorghum on the back of camels called Qalibah (قليبة). Rahal (رحل) A very particular funnellike basket is the Rahal (رحل). It is always used in pairs, attached to the sides of a donkey by placing a transverse wooden stick through their handles. Rahal are used to carry manure, mud or dates. The lower end of the funnel consists of a narrow hole (about 10 cm wide) that is plugged with a piece of cloth or Lif (ليف). In order to unload the cargo the plug is simply pulled out from below. Nowadays Rahal are mostly substituted by a combined pair of reworked plastic sacks of wheat. Other items plaited from palm leaflets are the Tabaq (طبق), a flat tray for winnowing wheat and sorghum during the threshing process and a small fan called Hebabah (هبابة), for heating the coal during the preparation of the traditional coffee (Gabenah, جبنة). Tabaq (طبق) used for winnowing Egyptian beans (فول مصري) Hebabah (هبابة) used to fan the coal underneath the Gabenah (جبنة) \\\\---- ==Lif (ليف) or Ashmiq (أشميق)== The connective tissue between young fronds, which eventually develops into a dried brown vascular bundle of rough fibre, attached to the lower edges of the midribs ensheathing the trunk, makes up a very durable tough fibre (cf. ZAID 2002). Lif can be woven to different strengths of ropes called Hibal (sing. Hibl, حبل). Ropes are used for the handles of baskets, the bridles for donkeys and camels, for carrying water containers attached to a stick and to string the frames of the traditional beds. Lif, preferably from Gau date trees is also used as a soft but durable filling material called Lihaf (لحاف). Among the older Manasir Lihaf is preferred to cotton for filling mattresses and considered very healthy. Lif is further employed to fill of the lower parts of donkey saddles in order to prevent sores by friction and called Libdah (لبدة) or Bedidah (بديدة – the \\"ة\\" can be substituted by a \\"ى\\"). The Bedouin Manasir employ Lif for the same purpose in their camel saddles and call it Tillah (تلّة). Lif further plays an important role in the Sudanese coffee tradition as the straining plug Lifei (ليفي) in the spout of the Gabenah (جبنة). \\\\---- ==Sabitah (سبيطة)== The fruit bunch of the female palm tree is also called Shakhlub (شخلوب) and consists of a central stem and about 100 to 150 strands of spikelets. Tabaq (طبق) made from palm leaflets The whole cluster can be used as a broom to sweep the ground whereby it is called Hanquqah (حنقوقة). Manasir girl with her colourfully decorated Kabbet (كبّت) But also some of the finest basketry of the region is created by wrapping palm leaflets, preferably of the Dum palm around a strand of spikelets. The resulting strand is spirally plaited to dishes. They are either used as a Kabbet (كبّت) for covering meals or the earthen water containers (Sir, زير), or as a Tabaq (طبق) in the shape of flat bowl for serving the traditional Kisrah bread (كسرة) on special occasions. The central part of Tabaqat can be worked from leather. Straps of cloth or plastic may be added to the leaflets in order to make the work more colourful and water resistant. \\\\---- ==Other raw materials== Apart from the listed by- products of palm trees, wood of other trees and the leather of the animals are used by the Manasir to manufacture tools and household items. The finest but rarely found handicraft of the region are big bowls (Tabaq, طبق), skillfully crafted out of the soft wood of Faidherbia albida (Haraz, حراز). Haraz wood is also used for the lower parts of donkey saddles. Nowadays the practise of fine wood carving has declined rapidly, one reason being the shortage of the particularly suitable Haraz tree. The most common agricultural tools in Dar al-Manasir are the Turiah (طورية), a hoe with an angular blade that proves very functional in opening and closing irrigation channels, and a small sawed sickle. Whereas the blade of the Turiah is bought from outside and often even imported from China, all wooden handles are locally produced. A different local impediment entirely manufactured from wood is the rake-like Arbil (اربيل) used for levelling the ground. Very popular among the Bedouin Manasir is the Qirbah (قربة), a hose made from the entire skin of a goat. Filled with a liquid it becomes moist and flexible. The Qirbah is hung in a shady windy place, either from the ceiling, a beam or on a wooden tripod. Due to constant evaporation its content is cooled down considerably. The riverain Manasir employ the Qirbah primarily for cooling fermented milk since their water is cooled in huge permeable earthen jars called Sir (زير). These jars are placed in the shadow of a tree or lined up in a row in isolated covered mud structures called Masirah (مزيرة).

He developed his estate at Margam near Swansea as an extensive ironworks, served by railways and a port, which was renamed Port Talbot. He served as a Member of Parliament for Glamorgan constituencies from 1830 until his death in 1890, a sixty-year tenure which made him the longest serving MP in the nineteenth century. He was Lord Lieutenant of Glamorgan, from 1848 to 1890. ==Background== Talbot was descended from the Earls of Shrewsbury, through Hensol Castle, Talbot's Castle and Lacock Abbey. The family had bought Margam Abbey and its extensive parish of Margam during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Having then married with the Mansels of Oxwich and Penrice, the Talbot's had become Glamorgan’s largest resident landowners, with estates totalling in that county alone. Their home estate at Margam included ancient metal workings, and extensive mineral rights across Margam, Kenfig and Aberavon. Talbot's father acquired the estate at Penrice, where having rebuilt Penrice Castle by 1820 the annual rent revenues reached £15,000.TALBOT, Christopher Rice Mansel (1803-1890), of Penrice Castle and Margam Park, Glam. History of Parliament Online ==Early life== Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot was born at Penrice, Swansea, the son of Thomas Mansel Talbot, and Lady Mary Lucy, the daughter of Henry Fox-Strangways, 2nd Earl of Ilchester. When his father died in 1813, Christopher was only ten years old, so his estates at Penrice and Margam were held in trust until he came of age in 1824. His governess for some time was Agnes Porter.Joanna Martin, ‘Porter, (Ann) Agnes (c.1752–1814)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 accessed 11 Aug 2017 He was educated at a private school in Dorset, and then at Harrow School and Oriel College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1824 with a 1st class honours degree in mathematics. He then undertook a Grand Tour of Europe. His favourite activities were yachting, racing and hunting. In 1823 he was elected a member of the Royal Yacht Club (later the Royal Yacht Squadron), and he was its Vice Commodore from 1851 to 1861. ==Early parliamentary and public career, 1830-1868== Nine members of the Mansel family had sat in Parliament from the early sixteenth century and the family were seen in aristocratic circles as Glamorganshire's natural representatives at Westminster. Talbot's father, however, had shown no interest in becoming an MP but after his death in 1813, the family reasserted its political influences when his mother's second husband, Sir Christopher Cole was elected as county member in 1817. This was commonly regarded as a family arrangement until C.R.M. Talbot was ready to enter political life. Even in 1817, however, there was some opposition to Cole's election. At the meeting in Bridgend where the new member was returned unopposed, George Tennant, a Swansea industrialist, struck a note of discontent. > Will you not, at some convenient time, avail yourself of those well-known > means which are always at hand to enable you to retire from your post, when > the infant legislator of the House of Margam shall be ripe for action, and > thus surrender back the situation which you hold as a trust for that family > by, whose interests you have been principally supported throughout the > present election. As widely expected therefore, Talbot virtually inherited the role of Member of Parliament for Glamorganshire in 1830 upon the retirement of his stepfather. Although nominally considered a Liberal, Talbot exercised considerable independence for most of his long political career, and his freedom to operate outside of party structures only became limited by the parliamentary reforms which occurred in the latter part of his time in the Commons, where he remained for the rest of his life. Although firmly of the Whig wing of the Liberal Party, Talbot had shown signs of support for more radical policies long before the Gladstonian takeover of the party in the 1860s. In 1853 he voted in favour of the ballot. Two years later he supported the abolition of church rates, and in 1856, voted along with the Swansea member Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn in support of Irish disestablishment. ==Industry and transport== Talbot recognised that improved transport could stimulate industrial growth, and as Member of Parliament he introduced a Bill in 1834 to improve the old harbour at Aberavon; two years later, a further Bill provided for the harbour's expansion and a change of name to Port Talbot in his honour. He also encouraged the development of Swansea docks, and pioneered the introduction of railways to south Wales, being chairman and a shareholder in the South Wales Railway Company, which was acquired by the Great Western Railway in 1863, with Talbot joining the board of the GWR. Talbot also invested in the area's extractive and metal production industries. The Port Talbot ironworks opened in early 1831, part of the industrialisation then taking place across south Wales; copper had been smelted at nearby Neath since 1584, and there were tinworks and ironworks at Pontardawe. In 1869 aboard his private yacht Lynx he attended the opening of the Suez Canal, accompanied by members of his family and several guests. When he was in Egypt, Gladstone offered him a peerage, but he declined on this and two other occasions. He was adjudged the wealthiest commoner of his time.John Vivian Hughes The wealthiest commoner: C. R. M. Talbot, M.P., F.R.S. (1803–1890)\\" ==Margam Castle== Over a ten-year period from 1830, Talbot set about redeveloping the family estate at Margam Castle. The mansion was designed in the Tudor Gothic style by architect Thomas Hopper (1776–1856), while Edward Haycock (1790–1870) was supervisory architect and designed parts of the interior and exterior of the house, the stables, terraces and lodges. Talbot also took a keen interest in the project, encouraging his architects to borrow elements from Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire (ancestral home of the Talbots and home to his cousin William Henry Fox Talbot) and Melbury House in Dorset (home of his mother's family, the Fox- Strangways, Earls of Ilchester). Margam Castle is a Grade I listed building owned by Neath and Port Talbot County Borough council.Margam Castle – Background Notes Talbot encouraged his relations William Fox Talbot and John Talbot Dillwyn Llewellyn in the development of photography and was himself a Fellow of the Royal Society. ==Later parliamentary career, 1868-1890== Talbot, like his fellow county member, Sir Hussey Vivian, were not opposed to parliamentary reform. The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884, together with the redistribution of boundaries for the 1885 General Election, led to the enfranchisement of increasing numbers of industrial workers. In time this was to revolutionise the politics of Glamorgan, but the immediate impact was to increase the Liberal Party's hold on the county and make the election of a Conservative, in most seats, almost inconceivable. On redistribution of parliamentary seats in 1885, he was elected for Mid Glamorganshire, a predominantly mining constituency, which included the Llynfi, Garw and Ogmore valleys Despite his venerable status the Liberal Association initially considered other candidates including Gwilym Williams and J. Carvell Williams. Talbot, at this time, was asked by William Abraham for his views on the election of labour representatives to the House of Commons, and specifically the desirability of a labour member representing the new Rhondda constituency. Talbot replied as follows: > I am of opinion that there has always hitherto been a great dearth of such > members in the House of Commons, and that if a few really able men were > elected, the proceedings in Parliament would be all the more likely to give > satisfaction to the bulk of the labouring classes. We have plenty of > employers of labour in the House, and many amongst them who profess to have > the interest of their men at heart, and we have also a large number who from > sentimental or philosophical motives advocate the promotion of the welfare > of the people. But none of these men possess that intimate acquaintance with > the peculiarities and specialties of mining operations which men who have > themselves had experience as workmen in the mine have acquired, and they are > often led in consequence to legislate on what they believe to be the > interest of their constituents, but in what really is to their injury. Hence > it is that I believe the presence of real working men in the House would be > of vast advantage to the community at large, and I should be very glad to > hear that the electors in the new Rhondda division entertained the same > feeling, and were likely to send one of their own body to represent them. Even though Talbot had reconciled himself with Gladstonian Liberalism to a significant extent, he had very little time for subjects relating specifically to Wales. He refused to take any part in the campaigns for Welsh disestablishment and Welsh intermediate education, in contrast to his fellow Glamorgan member, Hussey Vivian. Above all, he was firmly opposed to the Cymru Fydd movement. which demanded Welsh Home Rule. Having initially opposed Irish Home Rule, there was criticism of his standpoint, particularly in the Maesteg area. He complained to his fellow county member, Hussey Vivian, that he had a meeting with Maesteg Liberals and although they were friendly to his face, 'I am told that [they] became quarrelsome after I left, and suggested various substitutes'. A few weeks later, however, a meeting of the Association at Briton Ferry which, significantly, was not attended by delegates from some industrial districts, unanimously re-adopted Talbot, stating that he had 'made great progress towards the views they, as an association, held'. Although at heart a Liberal Unionist, Talbot also supported a range of Gladstonian policies and this was undoubtedly a factor in preventing opposition at the 1886 General Election. He retained his seat until his death, becoming Father of the House of Commons. He was described as \\"a tall, elderly gentleman ... wearing a long woollen comforter\\" in Sir Henry Lucy's Diary of the Salisbury Parliament for 10 June 1888 which was published in book form in 1892.House of Commons Information OfficeFactsheet M3Members SeriesThe Father of the HouseRevised November 2006 Talbot was the last Whig aristocratic landowner to represent Glamorgan in the House of Commons and, upon his death in 1890, he was succeeded by Samuel Thomas Evans, the nonconformist son of a Skewen tradesman, and a prominent radical. ==Legacy and family== On 31 October 1880, Talbot laid the foundation stone of Maesteg Town Hall, Maesteg. He gave £500 (£ today) towards the building fund, and the miners of the valley agreed to levy themselves a day's wages towards the cost. In Llanfair, his name still survives in \\"Talbot Terrace\\". In 1865 there was a public house in the village called the \\"Talbot Arms.\\"Llanfair St Mary Church History Talbot married Lady Charlotte Butler, daughter of Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Glengall, at Cahir House, County Tipperary on 28 December 1835.

He also served as Adjutant General of the State of Maryland. ==Early life== Reckord was born to John and Lydia (Zimmerman) Reckord at their home in Harford County, Maryland. He commenced work at his father's milling plant in 1896 upon his graduation from Bel Air High School. ==Military career== Reckord expressed desire to serve in the military, but, at the request of his mother, delayed entry into service until he turned 21. He enlisted in Company D, 1st Maryland Infantry, Maryland National Guard on February 15, 1901, and would eventually rise to command the same company when he was commissioned as a captain in December 1904. As a major, in 1916, Reckord was given command of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Maryland Infantry, which deployed to the Mexican border and served in the Mexican Expedition commanded by Gen. John J. Pershing. When the 29th Infantry Division was created on the eve of World War I in 1917, Reckord was given command of one of its regiments, the 115th Infantry, which saw combat during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. In 1920, he was appointed Adjutant General of the Maryland National Guard and, in 1934, while still serving as Maryland's Adjutant General, he assumed command of the 29th Infantry Division. During the years between the First and Second World War, Reckord was a leading advocate for increasing the role of the National Guard in the United States' national defensive strategy. From 1923 to 1925, he served as president of the National Guard Association of the United States. In 1933, he authored legislation that permanently gave National Guard personnel status as both state and federal troops. General Reckord speaks to a special services volunteer Reckord was mobilized for World War II with the 29th Infantry Division in February 1941 and took a leave of absence from his post as Maryland's Adjutant General. Deemed by the Army to be too old to command a division in combat, he was relieved of command and assigned as the commander of the III Corps Area. He later deployed overseas and was named Theater Provost Marshal, European Theater of Operations. After World War II, Reckord returned to his post as the Adjutant General of Maryland. He received a state promotion to Lieutenant General from Governor J. Millard Tawes in 1961, and continued to serve as Adjutant General until his retirement in 1966. ==Death and burial== Record died at Fort Howard Veterans Hospital in Fort Howard, Maryland on September 8, 1975. He was buried at Mountain Christian Church Cemetery in Joppa, Maryland. ==Family== In 1910, Reckord married Bessie Payne Roe. They were the parents of a daughter, Gladys Atchison Reckord. Mrs. Reckord died on January 17, 1943, and Reckord never remarried. After retiring, he resided in Ruxton, Maryland with his daughter and her husband, H. Frederick Jones Jr. ==Memberships== In his military life, Reckord was a leader of the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), and served as its president from 1923 to 1925. In the years after World War II, Reckord was chairman of the NGAUS Committee on Legislation, and was the first individual to be appointed a life member of the NGAUS Executive Council. He was also a member of the Adjutants General Association of the United States (AGAUS), the 29th Infantry Division Association, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Military Order of Foreign Wars, and the Army and Navy Club. In his civilian life, Reckord was a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA) beginning in 1920, and served on the organization's Executive Council and as its executive vice president. He served as president of both the Maryland Jockey Club, which owned Pimlico Race Course, and the Hartford Agricultural and Breeders Association, which owned Havre de Grace Racetrack. In addition, he belonged to the Freemasons, Maryland Club, Baltimore Country Club, Advertising Club of Baltimore, and Racquet Club of Washington, D.C. ==Legacy== The Reckord Trophy is a prize awarded annually to the Army National Guard battalion(s) that achieves the highest standards of training and readiness. The Reckord Trophy is one of the highest peacetime awards given to National Guard units. The Reckord Armory at the University of Maryland is named after General Reckord. ==Honors== Reckord was the recipient of several honorary degrees, including: Franklin & Marshall College (LL.D., 1943); Western Maryland College (Doctor of Military Science and Tactics, 1943); the University of Maryland (LL.D., 1944); and Pennsylvania Military College (LL.D., 1944). Reckord Armory, a recreation and athletics building on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park, was named for Reckord in 1961. There is also a National Guard facility in the town of Bel Air, Maryland known as Reckord Armory. No longer used for military activities, it is now a facility for public events including weddings, trade shows, and business meetings. In 1950, Reckord was the first recipient of the National Guard Association of the United States Distinguished Service Medal. Also in 1950, Reckord received the American Legion's Distinguished Service Medal. ==Awards and medals== Reckford´s decorations include the following: {| |- |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- |} {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !1st Row |colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\"| Army Distinguished Service Medal w/ 3 Oak Leaf Clusters |colspan=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"| Bronze Star Medal |- !2nd Row |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|Mexican Border Service Medal |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|World War I Victory Medal w/ two battle clasps |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|American Defense Service Medal |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|American Campaign Medal |- !3rd Row |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal w/ 3 service stars |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|World War II Victory Medal |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|Army of Occupation Medal |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|National Defense Service Medal |- !4th Row |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|Alabama Distinguished Service Medal |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|Virginia Distinguished Service Medal |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|Pennsylvania Distinguished Service Medal |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|State of Maryland Distinguished Service Cross |- !5th Row |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|Officer of the Legion of Honour |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|French Croix de guerre 1914–1918 w/ palm |colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"|French Croix de guerre 1939–1945 w/ palm |- |} ==See also== *A History of the Adjutants General of Maryland ==References== *Biographical information about Milton Reckord at UMD Archives ==Further reading== *The Maryland National Guard: A History of Maryland's Military Forces 1634-1991, by Joseph M.

The neighborhood is famous for its bungalows and other historic houses from the 1910s to the 1930s. It has become a destination for people across Atlanta with its eclectic mix of restaurants, bars, and shops as well as for the Summerfest festival, annual Tour of Homes and other events.

During the revolt against the construction of the I-485 freeway through Morningside and what is now Virginia–Highland, a pro-highway group called themselves the \\"Highland–Virginia Civic Association\\", claiming to speak for the neighborhood.

Around Atlanta, \\"Virginia–Highland\\", \\"Virginia Highlands\\" and \\"the Highlands\\" are all commonly heard. However, \\"Virginia–Highland\\" is the official name of the neighborhood. The other terms are included in some business names, but are incorrect. The term VaHi, imitating the New York style of naming neighborhoods (SoHo, TriBeCa), first was used in the Atlanta newspapers in 1998. It is now in common use as a shortened, playful form or in URLs of neighborhood media and organizations (examples are www.vahi.org, www.vahinews.com and vahi.patch.com). ==History== The first record of settlement of the area that is now Virginia–Highland was in 1812, when William Zachary bought and built a farm on of land there. In 1822 he sold his farm to Richard Copeland Todd (1792–1850). Todd's brother-in- law Hardy Ivy settled in 1832 in what is now Downtown Atlanta and the road between their two farms came to be known as Todd Road (a portion of which still exists in VirginiaºHighland). ===\\"Nine Mile Circle\\"=== 1902 map of Atlanta's streetcar network including Nine Mile Circle route In the 1880s, Georgia Railroad executive Richard Peters and real estate developer George Washington Adair organized the Atlanta Street Railway Company.History information adapted from Virginia–Highland Civic Association, Their first project was the Nine Mile Trolley, which started serving the area sometime between 1888 and 1890. At first, patrons used this streetcar line to visit \\"the countryside\\" outside the city, and the line stimulated later development in the area. Adair built his home at 964 Rupley Drive (still standing and divided into upscale apartments). The iconic curves in the street at the intersections of Virginia Ave. with N. Highland and Monroe are remnants of the trolley line, which required gentle curves. The Trolley Square Apartments (now \\"Virginia Highlands [sic] Apartments\\") near Virginia and Monroe were built on the site of trolley maintenance facilities. ===Residential development=== The first land to be subdivided in what is now Virginia–Highland was Highland Park in the 1890s, located on either side of Ponce de Leon Ave. between today's Barnett St. and N. Highland Ave. The majority of the houses and streets in Virginia–Highland were constructed between 1909 and 1926. In 1916 the Arc Light Controversy raged between neighbors on Adair Ave. and N. Highland Ave. ===Commercial development=== Some businesses opened around the intersection of Virginia and N. Highland starting in 1908, with many more opening starting in 1925. At the same time development started in the Atkins Park commercial district around St. Charles. Ave. and N. Highland, including the present-day Atkins Park Restaurant (1922), which reportedly got what is now Atlanta's oldest liquor license when it became a bar and restaurant in 1927. Between 1928 and 1930, the Howard Dry Cleaning Company and the Phelps Millard Grocery opened, anchoring the Amsterdam and N. Highland business district. The Samuel N. Inman School, named after the nineteenth-century cotton merchant, was built in 1923. In 1924, fire station 19 was built on N. Highland at Los Angeles Ave. Streetcar service to Virginia–Highland ended around 1947, along with all of the other trolley lines into and out of central Atlanta. ===Decline=== Virginia–Highland, like most intown Atlanta neighborhoods, suffered decline starting in the 1960s as residents moved to the suburbs. Less-affluent residents moved in, some single-family houses were turned into apartments, and crime increased. Some businesses closed and were replaced by lower-rent tenants such as pawn shops. Others, such as Moe’s and Joe’s (which opened in 1947) and Atkins Park Restaurant, stayed open. Many buildings deteriorated. ===Threat and defeat of I-485=== 1970 map of proposed route of I-485 through northeast Atlanta What could have been the death knell for the neighborhood sounded in the mid-1960s, when the Georgia Department of Transportation proposed building Interstate 485 to connect what is now Freedom Parkway through the neighborhood and to what is now Georgia 400 at Interstate 85. It would have included an interchange at Virginia Avenue where John Howell Memorial Park is today. Despite the I-485 proposal moving forward, a few middle-class families began moving back into the neighborhood, renovating homes. In Fall 1971, Joseph (Joe) Drolet and others founded the Virginia–Highland Civic Association (VHCA), whose mission was to defeat I-485,(\\"The Interstate That Almost Was\\", Morningside Lenox Park Association Newsletter, Fall 2003 and registered the association with the Georgia Secretary of State on August 22, 1972. They along with residents of Stone Mountain, Inman Park, and Morningside finally defeated I-485, and became a political force to be reckoned with. The current Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) system is an outgrowth of these events. In 2009, the original north/south freeway (connecting 675 to 400) was again put on GDOT's to-do list, but this time running in a tunnel underneath the neighborhoods, with buildings to vent exhaust fumes and smog above ground. Between 1972 and 1975, property values increased from 20 to 50 percent. Home ownership levels rose 20 percent. A tour of renovated homes started in 1972. The Georgia Department of Transportation began selling properties it had acquired for I-485, virtually all of them for infill housing. The of land on Virginia Avenue where 11 houses had been taken and demolished to make way for a Virginia Avenue exit, however, was finally opened in 1988 as John Howell Memorial Park, in memory of Virginia–Highland resident and anti-freeway activist John Howell, who died from complications of HIV in 1988. During the 1970s and 1980s the VHCA also worked to improve the city's process of home inspection, to develop a resource network of quality, affordable service providers to aid homeowners in renovation, and to encourage developers to lease renovated commercial buildings “as is” at low rates in order to encourage new and unique businesses, and thus a truly distinct commercial district. In the early 1980s, Atkins Park restaurant was renovated. Meanwhile, Stuart Meddin bought and renovated the 1925 commercial block at North Highland and Virginia. In 1988, the turn-of-the-century trolley barns on on Virginia Avenue on the east side of the BeltLine Eastside Trail (today's Virginia–Highland Apartments) were torn down despite the City Council and VHCA's attempts to save them. Although previously assuring local residents that he favored saving the historic structures, Mayor Andrew Young then vetoed the resolution, and the Council's vote of 11-3 was not enough to override it. Young cited the discovery of asbestos in the buildings and other hazardous materials on the property.\\"Proposal to save trolley barns fails by one vote in council\\", October 20, 1987, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Page A/28Citing asbestos, Young now wants trolley barns razed\\", October 17, 1987, Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Page Number: B/1 ===Metro-wide destination=== As the neighborhood continued to regentrify, property values increased rapidly; the shops and restaurants became progressively more upscale. Towards the end of the 90s, the neighborhood-oriented character of the business districts gave way to businesses serving patrons from across greater Atlanta. Virginia–Highland wrestled with traffic and parking issues. Apartments affordable to students became more difficult to find. In 2000, a spat among organizers and a shakeup in the organizing committee made local headlines.Michael Wall, \\"Will Va-Hi's Summerfest go bye-bye?\\", Creative Loafing, Sep. 16, 2000 However, Summerfest did continue as usual in 2001 as one of Atlanta's highest profile neighborhood festivals. ===Preservation and balance=== In November 2006, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation added Virginia–Highland to its list of \\"places in peril\\" due to an acceleration of teardowns and infill projects by real estate developers and newcomers to the area. However, Virginia–Highland remains one of the most architecturally historic, distinct and vibrant neighborhoods in Atlanta. Residents, through the VHCA, succeeded in getting the city council to pass zoning legislation prescribing development that fits the scale of the streets, rolling back loose zoning ordinances passed in the 1960s.Atlanta City Council minutes, December 1, 2008 The new zoning also prescribes a maximum number of each type of establishment – restaurants, bars, retail and other types. The zoning aims to preserve a vibrant mix of enterprises while keeping control noise, parking and traffic issues but also addresses specific problems which came up in 2005-2008: * Avoiding Virginia–Highland suffering the same fate as Buckhead Village, where a large number of bars opened, eventually attracting crime from other areas of the city. * Fighting a liquor permit for the 700-seat Hilan Theatre). * Opposing \\"The Mix@841\\" project at 841 N. Highland Ave., originally proposed to be 80 feet tall. In December 2008 the VHCA bought the land for New Highland Park, a small park at N. Highland and St. Charles. In Autumn 2010, a rash of seven muggings occurred, statistics which were far lower than those of the 1980s when the neighborhood was edgy, but in 2010 shaking up the neighborhood. Partly in response, the local security patrol, FBAC, expanded patrol coverage to the entire neighborhood. Shortly thereafter in Nov. 2010 Charles Boyer was murdered during a mugging, for which the \\"Jack Boys\\" were indicted in Jan. 2011. Police continued to step up patrols and since then Virginia–Highland has returned to its status as one of Atlanta's lower-crime neighborhoods. Currently the neighborhood is enjoying adjacent development projects including a new biking and walking trail along the BeltLine Eastside Trail from Piedmont Park to Inman Park, as well as the redeveloped Ponce City Market, the old Sears building, now a major multi-use development. Behind Ponce City Market is Historic Fourth Ward Park, opened in 2011. In July 2014 the Atlanta City Council accepted the Virginia–Highland Civic Association's master plan, as a result of which the plan becomes part of the City of Atlanta’s Comprehensive Development Plan. ==Location== Virginia–Highland is bounded on the north by Amsterdam Avenue and the neighborhood of Morningside, on the east by the Atlanta city limit/Briarcliff Road and the Druid Hills neighborhood, on the south by Ponce de Leon Avenue and the Poncey–Highland neighborhood, and on the west by the BeltLine Eastside Trail which is the border with Piedmont Park and Midtown.Street boundaries as defined by the Virginia–Highland Civic Association ===Atkins Park=== Within these boundaries is Atkins Park, a neighborhood listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The City of Atlanta recognizes Atkins Park as a separate neighborhood, however, Atkins Park is a part of the Virginia–Highland Civic Association. ===St. Charles-Greenwood=== St. Charles-Greenwood had its own neighborhood association in the 1980s, but was then absorbed into Virginia–Highland. ==Commercial districts== Virginia and N. Highland commercial node Virginia–Highland is one of many intown Atlanta neighborhoods characterized by commercial space of two sorts: * groups of small commercial units clustered at corner where the streetcars used to stop (e.g. N. Highland Ave. at St. Charles and Virginia) * commercial space in former warehouses and industrial buildings, especially, but not exclusively, along the BeltLine Eastside Trail (e.g. Amsterdam Walk and Ponce de Leon Place) Such \\"streetcar corner\\" nodes are located at Virginia at North Highland — the neighborhood's namesake and main shopping and dining area, well known since the 1990s for its restaurants, St. Charles at North Highland, Amsterdam at North Highland, and Virginia at Rosedale Drive. Amsterdam Walk, a shopping and entertainment complex built in what was originally part of the Campbell Coal Company warehouse. Ponce de Leon Place also has a concentration of warehouse space converted to commercial use. Just across the BeltLine Eastside Trail from the western border of Virginia–Highland are two major strip malls, Midtown Place and Midtown Promenade. Adjacent is the former Sears building, now Ponce City Market, with office, retail and residential space, and a gourmet food hall.\\"Slideshow: Jamestown reveals Ponce City Market\\", Atlanta Business Journal, June 29, 2011\\"Jamestown’s Michael Phillips on Ponce City Market\\", ATL Food Chatter (Atlanta magazine blog), July 18, 2011 ==Architecture== Fire Station #19 Adair Mansion Briarcliff Hotel, now Briarcliff Summit apartments The Colonnades apartment complex Virginia–Highland is best known for its oldest residences – the Craftsman bungalows that line the streets closest to which or on which the Nine Mile trolley ran: Virginia Avenue, North Highland Avenue, St. Charles Avenue, etc. Other architectural styles include English Vernacular Revival and Colonial Revival, and other house types include English Cottage and American Foursquare. Besides the churches noted below, some other landmarks of note are: * Fire station 19 (1924), built in 1924 in the bungalow style. Atlanta's oldest operating fire station at 1063 N. Highland Ave. * The Adair mansion at 964 Rupley Drive, now divided into apartments * Briarcliff Hotel (1925) (photo), 1050 Ponce De Leon Ave. at N. Highland. *The Colonnades residential building * the Hilan Theatre (1932) * Atkins Park Tavern (1922) * Belly, a delicatessen, formerly the Atkins Park Pharmacy (1914), later Fleeman's Pharmacy Virginia–Highland and Atkins Park are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), with Atkins Park having in addition the status of historic overlay district which, unlike a NRHP listing by itself, actually provides for measures to enforce preservation. The VHCA is investigating the possibilities of designating Virginia–Highland a historic overlay district as well. ==Law and GovernmentGovernment=== Virginia–Highland is a neighborhood of Atlanta, which unlike in many other cities, are officially defined and organized and given specific areas of control. The Virginia–Highland Civic Association consists of a volunteer board and oversees matters controlled at the neighborhood level such as community festivals, community safety, beautification, and efforts to improve parks, sidewalks, etc. As noted above, the Atkins Park neighborhood, while having its own neighborhoods association, participates in the VaHi association much as if it were part of VaHi. Planning, building permits, etc. are controlled by the Neighborhood planning unit F, which also includes Morningside-Lenox Park, Piedmont Heights and Lindridge-Martin Manor. ===Crime prevention=== Virginia–Highland serves as a model for other neighborhoods of Atlanta in implementing a comprehensive range of safety measures: * Virginia–Highland is part of APD patrol zone 6. * FBAC is the neighborhood security patrol, funded by members, run by volunteers and staffed by off-duty APD officers. * The VaHi Civic Association organizes a neighborhood watch program via its Safety Team. * VHAlerts is a system which leverages the text-message features of Twitter to allow members to text-message all other members in case of a dangerous situation in the neighborhood. ==Culture and RecreationParks=== John Howell Memorial Park Bridge in Orme Park Virginia–Highland borders: * Atlanta's landmark Piedmont Park (vastly expanded in 2011) * the Eastside Trail, part of the BeltLine, a former railroad line, now a 22-mile trail around the central neighborhoods of Atlanta. The BeltLine features dozens of outdoor artworks along its length through the Art on the BeltLine project. Within the boundaries of Virginia–Highland are: * John Howell Memorial Park, along Virginia Ave. between Barnett and Arcadia Streets * Orme Park, bounded by Brookridge Dr. and Elkmont Dr., through which Clear Creek runs * North Highland Park, which the civic association bought in 2008 and were developed in 2012 as an eco-friendly park and rain garden In 2014, residents cleaned up and beautified the unpaved alley between St. Charles Avenue and Ponce, and it is now known as Maiden Trail. ===\\"Neighborhood Arboretum\\"=== Virginia–Highland has one of seven Atlanta \\"neighborhood arboreta\\", which are in fact walking routes of trees (identified by markers) in yards, sidewalk planting strips, and parks. A brochure maps out the route and the trees along each route, as well as educating visitors about the trees. ===Festivals=== Virginia–Highland Summerfest The VHCA hosts the yearly Virginia–Highland Summerfest arts and music festival, which also includes a popular road race, and is one of the largest art festivals in the Southeastern United States and one of Atlanta's most popular neighborhood festivals. VHCA also organizes the annual Virginia–Highland Tour of Homes. In May, Taste of the Highlands in John Howell Park features samplings from favorite neighborhood restaurants and live music. Every March or April, the North Highland Mile (formerly Morningside Mile) race and block party takes place. ===Film and television=== Portions of the films Life as We Know It (the bakery portrayed was the real-life Belly General Store) and Trouble with the Curve (George's restaurant) were filmed in Virginia–Highland. Portions of the pilot for the \\"B.E.T.\\" network's Being Mary Jane were filmed at 780 N. Highland Ave. in April 2012.Jaclyn Hirsch, \\"Photos: TV Pilot Filming in Virginia–Highland: 'Being Mary Jane' filming all day Monday on N. Highland Avenue\\", Patch, April 23, 2012 ===Religion=== Virginia–Highland is home to a number of churches: * Church of Our Saviour (Anglo-Catholic Episcopalian) – current building mid-1930s * Druid Hills Presbyterian Church – built 1923, expanded 1940, 1963 * First Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church – built 1924 * Virginia–Highland Church UCC – built 1923 The Chabad Intown synagogue is located on Ponce de Leon Avenue. ====Eruv==== The Virginia–Highland eruv covers nearly all of Virginia–Highland as well as part of the Morningside-Lenox Park neighborhood up to E. Rock Springs Road/E. Morningside Drive. The eruv is \\"marked off\\" by defining utility poles as \\"sides of the doorways\\" and the wires as the \\"lintels\\" (tops of doorways). Within its boundaries observant Jews are allowed to do certain things on the Sabbath that they would not normally be allowed to do outside the home, such as carry keys or food. ==Education== Henry W. Grady High School Samuel M. Inman Middle School The community is zoned to Atlanta Public Schools. Zoned schools include: * Springdale Park Elementary * Inman Middle School * Henry W.

Beginning with the Maxwell equations relating the electric and magnetic field, and assuming a linear, homogeneous media with permeability \\\\mu\\\\, and permittivity \\\\epsilon\\\\,: : abla \\\\times \\\\textbf{E} = -j \\\\omega \\\\mu \\\\textbf{H}\\\\, : abla \\\\times \\\\textbf{H} = j \\\\omega \\\\epsilon \\\\textbf{E} + \\\\textbf{J}\\\\, Following the third equation involving the divergence of H : abla \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{H} = 0\\\\, by vector calculus we can write any divergenceless vector as the curl of another vector, hence : abla \\\\times \\\\textbf{A} = \\\\textbf{H}\\\\, where A is called the magnetic vector potential. Substituting this into the above we get : abla \\\\times (\\\\textbf{E} + j \\\\omega \\\\mu \\\\textbf{A}) = 0\\\\, and any curl-free vector can be written as the gradient of a scalar, hence :\\\\textbf{E} + j \\\\omega \\\\mu \\\\textbf{A} = - abla \\\\Phi where \\\\Phi is the electric scalar potential. These relationships now allow us to write : abla \\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\textbf{A} - k^{2}\\\\textbf{A} = \\\\textbf{J} - j \\\\omega \\\\epsilon abla \\\\Phi \\\\, where k = \\\\omega \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu \\\\epsilon}, which can be rewritten by vector identity as : abla ( abla \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{A}) - abla^{2} \\\\textbf{A} - k^{2}\\\\textbf{A} = \\\\textbf{J} - j \\\\omega \\\\epsilon abla \\\\Phi \\\\, As we have only specified the curl of A, we are free to define the divergence, and choose the following: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{A} = - j \\\\omega \\\\epsilon \\\\Phi \\\\, which is called the Lorenz gauge condition. The previous expression for A now reduces to : abla^{2} \\\\textbf{A} + k^{2}\\\\textbf{A} = -\\\\textbf{J}\\\\, which is the vector Helmholtz equation. The solution of this equation for A is :\\\\textbf{A}(\\\\textbf{r}) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\iiint \\\\textbf{J}(\\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}) \\\\ G(\\\\textbf{r}, \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}) \\\\ d\\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime} \\\\, where G(\\\\textbf{r}, \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime})\\\\, is the three-dimensional homogeneous Green's function given by :G(\\\\textbf{r}, \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}) = \\\\frac{e^{-j k |\\\\textbf{r} - \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}|}}{|\\\\textbf{r} - \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}|}\\\\, We can now write what is called the electric field integral equation (EFIE), relating the electric field E to the vector potential A :\\\\textbf{E} = -j \\\\omega \\\\mu \\\\textbf{A} + \\\\frac{1}{j \\\\omega \\\\epsilon} abla ( abla \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{A})\\\\, We can further represent the EFIE in the dyadic form as :\\\\textbf{E} = -j \\\\omega \\\\mu \\\\int_V d \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime} \\\\textbf{G}(\\\\textbf{r}, \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}) \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{J}(\\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}) \\\\, where \\\\textbf{G}(\\\\textbf{r}, \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime})\\\\, here is the dyadic homogeneous Green's Function given by :\\\\textbf{G}(\\\\textbf{r}, \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\left[ \\\\textbf{I}+\\\\frac{ abla abla}{k^2} \\\\right] G(\\\\textbf{r}, \\\\textbf{r}^{\\\\prime}) \\\\, ==Interpretation== The EFIE describes a radiated field E given a set of sources J, and as such it is the fundamental equation used in antenna analysis and design. It is a very general relationship that can be used to compute the radiated field of any sort of antenna once the current distribution on it is known. The most important aspect of the EFIE is that it allows us to solve the radiation/scattering problem in an unbounded region, or one whose boundary is located at infinity. For closed surfaces, it is possible to use the Magnetic Field Integral Equation or the Combined Field Integral Equation, both of which result in a set of equations with improved condition number compared to the EFIE. However, the MFIE and CFIE can still contain resonances. In scattering problems, it is desirable to determine an unknown scattered field E_{s} that is due to a known incident field E_{i}. Unfortunately, the EFIE relates the scattered field to J, not the incident field, so we do not know what J is. This sort of problem can be solved by imposing the boundary conditions on the incident and scattered field, allowing one to write the EFIE in terms of E_{i} and J alone. Once this has been done, the integral equation can then be solved by a numerical technique appropriate to integral equations such as the method of moments. ==Notes== By the Helmholtz theorem a vector field is described completely by its divergence and curl. As the divergence was not defined, we are justified by choosing the Lorenz Gauge condition above provided that we consistently use this definition of the divergence of A in all subsequent analysis. However, other choices for abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A} are just as valid and lead to other equations, which all describe the same phenomena, and the solutions of the equations for any choice of abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A} lead to the same electromagnetic fields, and the same physical predictions about the fields and charges are accelerated by them. It is natural to think that if a quantity exhibits this degree of freedom in its choice, then it should not be interpreted as a real physical quantity. After all, if we can freely choose abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{A} to be anything, then \\\\mathbf{A} is not unique. One may ask: what is the \\"true\\" value of \\\\mathbf{A} measured in an experiment? If \\\\mathbf{A} is not unique, then the only logical answer must be that we can never measure the value of \\\\mathbf{A}. On this basis, it is often stated that it is not a real physical quantity and it is believed that the fields \\\\mathbf{E} and \\\\mathbf{B} are the true physical quantities. However, there is at least one experiment in which value of the \\\\mathbf{E} and \\\\mathbf{B} are both zero at the location of a charged particle, but it is nevertheless affected by the presence of a local magnetic vector potential; see the Aharonov–Bohm effect for details. Nevertheless, even in the Aharonov–Bohm experiment, the divergence \\\\mathbf{A} never enters the calculations; only abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A} along the path of the particle determines the measurable effect. ==References== *Gibson, Walton C.

It is an almost entirely residential inter-war development, with Edwardian streets on its southern fringes. Its main neighbours are Westbury on Trym, Horfield, Bishopston and Redland. Until 2016 Henleaze was the name of a ward for Bristol City Council, which included Golden Hill and Westbury Park as well as Henleaze.Ward map Henleaze is now part of the Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze ward. ==History== The name of Henleaze probably derives from a Robert Henley, who in 1659 bought a property which became known as Henley's House and later as Henleaze Park.The Henleaze Book, p.1 The area was a rural part of the parish of Westbury on Trym until 1896, when land between Henleaze Road and Durdham Down was sold for development. Most of the rest of the area was developed in the 1920s.THE HENLEAZE BOOK ==Politics== Henleaze is in the Bristol North West constituency, and the MP for the area is Darren Jones, for Labour. There are three seats on Bristol City Council for the Westbury-on-Trym & Henleaze ward, one held by Liberal Democrats and two by the Conservatives as of the 2016 elections. Up until the early 1990s, it was a solid Conservative area, however The Liberal Democrats established a more solid position up until 2006, when it began to swing back to the Conservatives. In the 2009 elections, when the Liberal Democrats took control of the City Council, Liz Radford a local campaigner achieved an unprecedented swing in the ward for the Conservatives. Henleaze would have fallen to them if the swing had been just 1.5% higher. Henleaze is one of the most affluent areas of the city. Among the thirty-five wards into which Bristol is divided, it had the fifth lowest proportion of people in routine and semi-routine occupations, according to the 2001 census, and the fifth highest proportion with higher education qualifications. ==Amenities== Henleaze Lake, a flooded former quarry on the northern edge of Henleaze near Southmead and Westbury on Trym, is owned by the Charity (No 1132633) \\"Henleaze Swimming Club\\" since 2009Henleaze Swimming Club website and celebrated its Centenary in 2019 Susie Parr 2019 The Lake Henleaze Swimming Club The other former quarry was filled in and made into a park, now known as Old Quarry Park. It was recently renovated with the help of a grant from the National Lottery for the provision of play equipment, seating and flower beds. Henleaze also features newsagents, bakeries, supermarkets and charity-shops, as well as a library, the Orpheus cinema which is run by 'King' Harold and Scott Cinemas and the Den (Est 2007). Henleaze Old Boys Cricket Club was formed in 2005 and play at the neighbouring Golden Hill Cricket ground. The membership of the club is primarily former Henleaze Junior School pupils. There is also a thriving Tennis Club based in Tennessee Grove with 4 outdoor courts and planning permission for floodlighting one has recently been granted. ==Churches== Henleaze parish church, St Peter's, was designed and built in 1926 by A.

He was the second son of Zheng Jing and a grandson of Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong). After surrendering to the Qing dynasty in 1683, he was ennobled as Duke Hanjun, and lived the rest of his life in Beijing. ==Life== Zheng Keshuang was born in of the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan; the administrative centre of Chengtian Prefecture was at Fort Provintia. His father was Zheng Jing, the king of Tungning and the eldest son of Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), the founder of Tungning. His biological mother was Lady Huang (黃氏), Zheng Jing's concubine. When Zheng Jing was leading a campaign against the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in China in the late 1670s, he designated his elder son, Zheng Kezang, as his heir apparent and put him in charge of Tungning's internal affairs. At the same time, he also arranged marriages between his two sons and the daughters of two of his most trusted officials: Zheng Kezang married the daughter of , while Zheng Keshuang married the daughter of Feng Xifan. Zheng Jing returned to Tungning in 1680 from a failed campaign against the Qing Empire. In the same year, Chen Yonghua died after he was ousted from the political arena by his rivals, Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan (劉國軒). Zheng Jing died a year later in Chengtian Prefecture. After Zheng Jing's death, Feng Xifan allied with Liu Guoxuan, Zheng Cong (鄭聰) and others to slander Zheng Kezang in front of Queen Dowager Dong, Zheng Jing's mother. They claimed that Zheng Kezang was not Zheng Jing's biological son, and launched a coup to kill Zheng Kezang and seize power. Following the coup, a 12-year-old Zheng Keshuang was installed on the throne as the ruler of Tungning under the title \\"Prince of Yanping\\" (延平王). After his accession to the throne, Zheng Keshuang rewarded the officials who supported him in the coup by granting them nobility titles. He also gave posthumous honorary titles to his ancestors. In 1683, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty ordered Shi Lang to lead a naval fleet to attack and conquer Tungning. Shi Lang and his fleet defeated the Tungning forces, led by Liu Guoxuan, at the Battle of Penghu. After the battle, the Tungning royal court split into two factions, with one advocating war and the other advocating surrender. The \\"war\\" faction was led by Zheng Dexiao (鄭得瀟), Huang Liangji (黃良驥), Xiao Wu (蕭武) and Hong Gongzhu (洪拱柱), while the \\"surrender\\" faction was led by Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan. Zheng Keshuang heeded Feng and Liu's advice.Hung, “Taiwan Under the Cheng Family, 1662 – 1683\\" On 5 July 1683, Feng Xifan ordered Zheng Dexiao to write a surrender document to the Qing Empire. About ten days later, Feng sent Zheng Keshuang to meet Shi Lang. On 13 August, Shi Lang entered Taiwan and received the official surrender. Noble titles were given to the dynasts and officers of the formerly reigning House of Koxinga. Zheng Keshuang and his family were taken to the Qing imperial capital, Beijing, to meet the Kangxi Emperor. The emperor made Zheng Keshuang a member of the Plain Yellow Banner and awarded him the hereditary title Duke Hanjun (漢軍公; lit. \\"the duke of Han Eight Banners\\").http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/CHENG_CHING.html Some former Tungning military units, such as the rattan shield troops, were inducted into the Qing military and deployed in the battle against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. Zheng Keshuang died of illness in 1707 in Beijing at the age of 37. His younger brother, Zheng Kexue (鄭克壆), was ordered by the Qing government to bury the remains of Zheng Chenggong and Zheng Jing in Quanzhou, Fujian – the ancestral home of the House of Koxinga. Zheng Keshuang's mother, Lady Huang, tried to seek assistance from the Qing government to return their family property in Fujian to them, which was annexed by local officials, but she failed. Later, during the reign of Yongzheng Emperor, the remaining family of Zheng's was reassigned to Plain Red Banner. == Descendants == Zheng Keshuang was survived by three sons: Zheng Anfu (鄭安福), Zheng Anlu (鄭安祿), and Zheng Ankang (鄭安康). However, all his sons died without issue; and so, Zheng Xianji (鄭咸吉), a first cousin once removed of them, was appointed as heir to Zheng Anfu. Zheng Xianji was the elder son of Zheng Ande (鄭安德) and a grandson of Zheng Keqiao (鄭克塙), and the latter was the youngest brother of Zheng Keshuang. Zheng's descendants served as Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty's fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian. They still live there to this day. A poet Zheng Chouyu (鄭愁予; born 1933), claimed to be one of Zheng's descendants, was born in Shandong province in China. Zheng Xiaoxuan 鄭曉嵐 the father of Zheng Chouyu, fought against the Japanese invaders in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Zheng Chouyu was born in Shandong in mainland China and called himself a \\"child of the resistance\\" against Japan and he became a refugee during the war, moving from place to place across China to avoid the Japanese. He moved to Taiwan in 1949 and focuses his work on building stronger ties between Taiwan and mainland China. Zheng Chouyu was born in mainland China, he identified as Chinese and he felt alienated after he was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949 which was previously under Japanese rule and felt strange and foreign to him. ==In fiction== Zheng Keshuang appears as one of the antagonists in the novel The Deer and the Cauldron by Louis Cha. ==See also== * Kingdom of Tungning * History of Taiwan * Shi Lang ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:House of Koxinga Category:Kingdom of Tungning Category:Hokkien royalty Category:17th-century Taiwanese people Category:Taiwanese people of Hoklo descent Category:Taiwanese politicians of Japanese descent Category:1670 births Category:1707 deaths Category:1670s in Taiwan Category:1680s in Taiwan Category:17th-century monarchs in Asia Category:Politicians from Tainan Category:Qing dynasty politicians Category:Han Chinese Plain Yellow Bannermen Category:Chinese nobility Category:Chinese politicians of Japanese descent ","title":"Zheng Keshuang"},{"id":"2001911","text":"Inveraray Jail, in Inveraray, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, is a 19th-century prison and courthouse. In use as a prison from 1820 to 1889, the building is now a living museum. It is a category A listed building. ==History== Designed by James Gillespie Graham (1776–1855) in 1813 after original plans by Robert Reid in 1807. The original plans had called for a courthouse and three prisons, one for males, one for females and one for debtors. The ground obtained was sufficient for such an ambitious plan, but the finance was not and the Prison Commissioners had to be content with only one prison. Both the courthouse and prisons opened in 1820. The courtroom, on the first floor, has a semicircle of large windows which overlook the prison yard and, beyond, to Loch Fyne. The two-storied prison has three-foot-thick walls of rough hewn red stone and originally contained cells on both floors, eight in total. A third of the ground floor was occupied by a day-room which was lit, like the cells, by narrow, unglazed windows. The Prisons (Scotland) Act 1839 brought about many changes, including the separation of prisoners. A second prison was finally built on the spare ground, opening in the closing days of 1848. Designed by Thomas Brown of Edinburgh, the new prison consisted of twelve cells on three floors with an exercising gallery at the top. A pair of outdoor exercise yards were also built, separated from each other by a wall. Prisoners were not allowed to fraternize. The separate system was designed to give them time to reflect upon their sins. Interior of Inverary Jail cell The Prisons (Scotland) Act 1877 heralded another major change in the administration of prisons. Local authorities would no longer have the responsibility of running and financing prisons; the Government was taking control. Large prisons were built in population centres. Barlinnie in Glasgow opened in 1882 and small local prisons in the West of Scotland began to close. Inveraray would be the last. On 20 July 1889 readers of the Argyllshire Herald were informed that \\"the prison of Inveraray will be closed on 31st August\\". Despite changes to the prison system, the court was still sitting, continuing until 1954, with a little activity since then. On several occasions the premises have come near to being abandoned, especially when it was necessary to spend money on repairs. In the 1980s extensive restoration was undertaken by the Scottish Office, but then all plans fell through and the building lay empty. In May 1989, Inveraray Jail was reopened as a privately owned tourist attraction, re- enacting the trials and the life of the inmates of the 19th century. ==References External links == * Category:Defunct prisons in Scotland Category:James Gillespie Graham buildings Category:Museums in Argyll and Bute Category:Living museums in the United Kingdom Category:Prison museums in the United Kingdom Category:Category A listed buildings in Argyll and Bute Category:Listed prison buildings in Scotland Category:Inveraray ","title":"Inveraray Jail"},{"id":"2001915","text":"right Peter Puck is a hockey puck-shaped cartoon character.

He is especially remembered for his important contributions to the classical guitar repertoire, becoming one of the leading twentieth-century composers for the instrument. He was also one of the foremost composers of zarzuelas, a form of Spanish light opera. His 1932 zarzuela, Luisa Fernanda, has proved to be enduringly popular. In addition, he composed ballets, symphonic works, and piano pieces, as well as one-act operas and one full-length opera, El poeta, which premiered in 1980, starring well-known tenor Plácido Domingo. Moreno Torroba also ran his own zarzuela company, which toured extensively, especially in Latin America. ==Biography and career== Over the course of his long career, Moreno Torroba composed many works, both in traditional Spanish forms and for the concert hall. He is often associated with the zarzuela, a traditional Spanish musical form. He achieved his greatest success in the 1930s with the zarzuelas Luisa Fernanda (1932) and La Chulapona (1934). Directing several opera companies, Moreno Torroba helped introduce the zarzuela to international audiences. In 1946 he formed a zarzuela company with singers Plácido Domingo Ferrer and Pepita Embil, the parents of Plácido Domingo and close friends of his. The company toured Latin America for two years, becoming particularly popular in Mexico.

The school is part of Kennewick School District. Construction of the $30 million building began in 1995, with classroom doors opening in the spring of 1997. The plans for Southridge High School were originally designed for a high school on the east side of the country; however, the school was never built and the Kennewick School District purchased the blueprints and plans. During construction, classes were held at Fruitland Elementary School, under the direction of Principal Ron Williamson. The first commencement was held inside the Toyota Center in June 1999. Southridge was the third 4A school constructed in Kennewick, but with the reorganization of leagues in 2006, Southridge became a 3A school and is now a member of the Columbia Basin League.Prep Report: Big Nine to go 4A/3A Yet again, in 2008, it was decided that Southridge would be put back under the 4A schools along with 2 other high schools in Kennewick, WA. Once again in 2010 Southridge was brought back down to a 3A school. ==Facilities== The campus lies within a valley on the southwest border of Kennewick. Southridge is located several miles away from the majority of its students. The school's main complex, divided into wings A through F, was designed by the architecture firm Hammel, Green and Abrahamson of Minnesota; Joe Lavernier Construction of Spokane was the general contractor. The B, C and D-wings are classrooms, each containing two floors with eight classrooms per floor as well as lockers. The A-wing houses the auditorium, cafeteria and music rooms. The F-wing contains one large gym and a small gym as well as a weight room - with locker rooms and training room both located downstairs. The E-wing contains the library and main offices. The wings are all connected by a long crescent-shaped hall with A and F-wing at the north and south ends, respectively. The E-wing is in the inner curve, and wings B, C and D branch off along the outer curve. The school grounds include football and baseball fields, as well as softball fields, a track, several soccer fields and eight lit tennis courts. The school uses the Kennewick Public Pool as it does not have one of its own. ==Home of the Suns== The school nickname, the Suns, was selected in a vote among the first freshman class (Class of 1999). The mascot is a gorilla named \\"Sunny\\" and was inducted into SHS in the 2006-2007 school year. The school colors are blue and gold (originally blue, silver and gold). The school fight song, Southridge Will Forever Hold My Heart, was written in 1996 by a Southridge student to the tune of the Notre Dame Victory March. Southridge has a storied Mock Trial Program. Winning back to back YMCA Mock Trial regional championships in 2012 and 2013, and attending the Washington State YMCA tournament multiple times. The Southridge Drama department and Drama Club produce several ensemble performances each year. Southridge also has one of the best engineering technology programs in the state, led formally by Jim Hendricks, who was invited to join Tri-Cities STEM School, Delta High, in 2009. It offers college-level projects like power supplies and \\"Sumo\\" robots, with which it compete with Battelle. Its material science course offers the chance to create a sterling silver ring and a personal piece of stained glass, both designed by the students. The course was taught by Roy Bunnell. Former Southridge student Danica Lyn Stewart achieved acting success in her adult life and can be seen on NBC's daytime soap Passions.Danica Stewart ==Athletics== Southridge participates in the Columbia Basin Big Nine (CBBN) 3A. The CBBN is the former Columbia Basin League which is the former Big Nine. Football and soccer games are played at Neil F. Lampson Stadium, which is located on the grounds of Kennewick High School. Southridge shares the stadium with Kennewick and Kamiakin High School. In their brief existence, the Suns have won state championships in dance for 4 years (2004–2008), golf, soccer, and baseball,STATS along with several individual state championships in tennis, gymnastics, Swimming, diving, ice hockey, and wrestling. ==Fight song== The Southridge High School fight song is sung to the tune of the Notre Dame Fight Song.

It is frequently used for governmental conferences, summits and other official purposes, including the prime minister's new year speech.Eva Mellbin & Franz-Michael Skjold Mellbin, Nu Gælder Det Danmark! (The Danish Minister of State's New Year Speeches), Lindhardt & Ringhof (2011), , p. 13 .Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen’s New Year Address 1 January 2010 - Statsministeriet. (1 January 2010). Accessed: 2 September 2012. Unlike the residences of many other heads of government and state (e.g. the White House, 10 Downing Street, La Moncloa and Élysée Palace), Marienborg does not serve as the government headquarters or contain the office of the prime minister. The Prime Minister's Office is instead located in Christiansborg on Slotsholmen in downtown Copenhagen. Marienborg was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1964. ==History18th century=== Ny Frederiksdal - seen as a cluster of unnamed houses - on a map from 1767 In the 18th century, the region north of Copenhagen became popular for its scenic views and opportunities for recreation with the surrounding meadows, woods and lakes, with many summer residences being built. Marienborg is one of several properties which were sold off from the Frederiksdal estate from the middle of the 18th century and used for the construction of country houses. They were collectively referred to as Ny Frederiksdal (New Frederiksdal) and also comprised Søro, Tusculum, Sophienholm and Christianelyst. The main building was constructed in around 1745 for the naval officer and director of the Danish Asiatic Company Olfert Fas Fischer. He was the father of the much more famous naval hero Olfert Fischer. Johan Frederik Lindencrone In 1750, Fischer sold the estate to Peter de Windt. Windt's widow, Maria Cathrine Michaelsdatter Fabritius, a daughter of the wealthy merchant Michael Fabritius, sold the estate to Jacob Frederik Schaffalitzky de Muckadell a few years after his death. The next owner Gysbert Behagen, from 1764 to 1792, was a wealthy merchant, ship-owner and director of the Danish Asiatic Company. His city home was the Behagen House in Christianshavn. He was succeeded by Hans Werner Rudolf Rosenkrantz Giedde. The estate was in 1795 acquired by Johan Frederik Lindencrone, the owner of the Lindencrone Mansion in Copenhagen as well as Gjorslev Manor on Stevns, who named it Marienborg after his wife Marie. ===19th century=== In 1800, Lindencrone had to sell Marienborg due to economic difficulties. The buyer, Johann Traugott Lebrecht Otto (1766-1824), had served as garrison surgeon on Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies. In 1801, he sold the estate to Julius Ludvig Frederik Rantzau and Johan de Windt. In 1803, Marienborg changed hands again when it was acquired by Jean de Coninck (1744-1807). He was the brother of Frédéric de Coninck. Nybrovej with Marienborg visible in the background 1876 Peter Boll Wivet (1760-1824), a Supreme Court attorney, owned Marienborg from 1809 and until his death in 1824. Marienborg was in 1853 acquired by Vilhelm Junius Lorentz Petersen, the owner of Lorentz Petersen, a wine business with roots dating back to 1788. On his death in 1863, it was sold to Rosalie Hennings, whose husband, Adam Gottlob Moltke of Espe and Bonderup, had also just passed away. On her death, Marienborg remained in the hands of the Moltke family for the next 15 years. ===20th century=== Agnes Lunn: From Marienborg (1937). The artist, a cousin of David's mother, was his god mother Oscar Wandel, owner of Carl Wandel & Søn, a wine company, purchased Marienborg in 1899. In 1815, he sold the estate to Vilhelm Skovgaard-Petersen, Upon the death of the last private owner, barrister and patron of the arts C. L. David, Marienborg was bequeathed in 1960 to the Danish state as a summer residence for the prime minister in office. ==Architecture== Many different owners have left their marks on Marienborg and its architecture. The interiors have also been modified repeatedly. Today, Marienborg stands out as a restored classicist estate with a few carefully selected modern accents. ==Interior== The interior of the mansion will be refurbished in 2017. The A.P.

He is also a member of the National Research Foundation (South Africa), who list him as one of their highest-rated members. He has run more than 70 marathons and ultramarathons, and is the author of several books on exercise and diet. He is known for his work in sports science and for his support of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet, as set out in his books The Real Meal Revolution and Lore of Nutrition: Challenging Conventional Dietary Beliefs. ==Background== Noakes was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (today Harare, Zimbabwe) in 1949 and moved to South Africa at the age of five. His father had arrived in what was then Southern Rhodesia in 1946, establishing a successful tobacco exporting company that he sold in 1954. As a young boy his main sporting interest was cricket. Noakes attended Monterey Preparatory School in Constantia, Cape Town. One year was spent as a foreign exchange student at Huntington Park High School in Huntington Park, California. Prep school was followed by Diocesan College. He has earned an MBChB (1974), MD (1981), and DSc (Med) (2002). ==Research== In 1980 Noakes was tasked to start a sports science course at the University of Cape Town. Noakes went on to head the Medical Research Council-funded Bioenergetics of Exercise Research Unit, which was later changed to the MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine.MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine In the early 1990s Noakes co-founded the Sports Science Institute of South Africa,Sports Science Institute of South Africa with former South African rugby player Morne du Plessis. His unit's physiological research has produced over 370 scientific articles since 1996. He is a leading researcher on the condition now known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). He first recognised this condition in a female runner during the 1984 Comrades Marathon, and published his findings in 1985 in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. Noakes hosted the 1st International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference in Cape Town in May 2005. In 1996 Noakes published his theory of the \\"central governor\\".Gifford, Bill. (December 8, 2016). \\"The Silencing of Tim Noakes\\", Outside. Retrieved January 23, 2019.

In 2005 he undertook a series of experiments in the Arctic and Antarctic on South African (British-born) swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh to understand human capability in extreme cold. He discovered that Pugh had the ability to raise his core body temperature before entering the water in anticipation of the cold and coined the phrase 'anticipatory thermo-genesis' to describe it.\\"Pugh will be the guinea pig\\", (March 2, 2006).

Retrieved January 24, 2019. ==Opinions on health== Noakes is an advocate of a low- carbohydrate, high-fat diet, often referred to in South Africa as the \\"Noakes\\" or \\"Banting\\" diet. Noakes has characterised mainstream dietary advice as \\"genocide\\". In February 2014 a registered dietician complained to the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) that Noakes tweeted to a mother that she should wean her baby onto low-carbohydrate, high-fat foods, which he described as real foods. The HPCSA held a hearing about the allegation against Noakes over the next few years. Controversially, on 28 October 2016, the HPSCA incorrectly released a statement announcing that Noakes had been found guilty of misconduct. In a second press release issued over three hours later, the HPSCA apologised for the mistake. Noakes was cleared of misconduct in April 2017. The HPSCA lost its appeal in June 2018.\\"Noakes clears final hurdle, not guilty says HPCSA appeal committee\\" (9 June 2018). News24. retrieved January 23, 2019. In August 2014, Noakes sent a tweet to his 46,000 Twitter followers which said: \\"Dishonest science. Proven link between autism and early immunisation covered up?\\". The tweet included a link to a video from disgraced ex-doctor and anti-vaccine activist Andrew Wakefield, in which Wakefield was repeating the conspiracy theory that the CDC is covering-up a link between vaccination and autism. Subsequently challenged on Twitter, Noakes responded that he personally had \\"no opinion\\" on the matter. Noakes co-wrote the 2017 book Lore of Nutrition with journalist Marika Sboros. In it Noakes describes his Damascene conversion to low-carbohydrate dieting, explores how the lipid hypothesis is the \\"biggest mistake in modern medicine\\" and details his struggles with the medical establishment. In a review for Medical Brief, paediatrician Alastair McAlpine described the book as \\"an extraordinarily heady mix of conspiracy theory, bad science, bad writing, and persecution complex\\". ==Awards and achievements== In 1996 he was honoured by the American College of Sports Medicine when he was asked to present the J.B. Wolfe Memorial Lecture, the college's keynote address at its annual meeting. In 2002 he was awarded a Doctorate in Science (DSc). In 2002 Noakes was awarded the International Cannes Grand Prix Award for Research in Medicine and Water, for his work on Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). In 2004 Runner's World (USA) included this work as one of the 40 most important \\"persons or events\\" in the sport of running in the past 40 years. In 2008 he was elected an honorary fellow of the Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine (UK), the first foreigner to be so recognised. In that year he also received the Order of Mapungubwe (Silver), from the President of South Africa for his \\"excellent contribution in the field of sports and the science of physical exercise\\". In 2011 Noakes was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands. In 2012 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from South Africa's National Research Foundation for his contribution to sports science research. In 2014 the Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science (S2A3) awarded Noakes their prestigious South Africa Medal (gold) for his outstanding contributions to sport physiology.Plug, C.

They are members of the largest vertebrate order, Perciformes.Jaeger, Matthew. 2004. Montana's Fish Species of Special Concern: Sauger. Montana Cooperative Fisheries Research Unit. http://www.fisheriessociety.org/AFSmontana/SSCpages/Sauger%20Status.htm. (Accessed May 2011). They are the most migratory percid species in North America.Kuhn et al. 2008. Habitat Use and Movement Patterns by Adult Saugers from fall to Summer in an Unimpounded Small-River System. North American Journal of Fisheries Management. 28: 360-367. American Fisheries Society. 2008. Saugers obtain two dorsal fins, the first is spiny and the posterior dorsal fin is a soft-rayed fin. Their paired fins are in the thoracic position and their caudal fin is truncated which means squared off at the corners, a characteristic of the family Percidae. Another physical characteristic of Saugers are their ctenoid scales which is common in advanced fishes. Saugers have a fusiform body structure, and as a result saugers are well adapted predatory fishes and are capable of swimming into fast currents with minimal drag on their bodies. They may be distinguished from walleyes by the distinctly spotted dorsal fin, by the lack of a white splotch on the caudal fin, by the rough skin over their gill, and by their generally more brassy color, or darker (almost black) color in some regions. The average sauger in an angler's creel is in weight. ==Distribution== Saugers are a widely distributed fish species. Their historical range consisted of eastern U.S west of the Appalachian Mountains, mostly southern, central, and western U.S up into southern Canada. Sauger distribution and range has decreased from historical ranges because of degraded and fragmented habitat conditions.Jaeger et al. 2005. Seasonal Movements, Habitat Use, Aggregation, Exploitation, and Entrainment of Saugers in the Lower Yellowstone River: An Empirical Assessment of Factors Affecting Population Recovery. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 25.1550-1568. American Fisheries Society 2005. Sauger distribution within its home range varies by time of year because they are a migratory fish species. Saugers are more typical of rivers whereas walleyes are more common in lakes and reservoirs. In many parts of their range, saugers are sympatric with walleyes. Hybridization between saugers and walleyes is not unknown; the hybrids, referred to as saugeyes, exhibit traits of both species. Being intermediate in appearance between the two species, saugeyes are sometimes difficult to differentiate, but they generally carry the dark blotches characteristic of the sauger. Saugers, however, are usually smaller and will better tolerate waters of higher turbidity than the walleye. Saugers require warmer summer water temperatures of 20-28 degrees Celsius. The need for warm water temperatures is thought to affect the northern and western boundaries of their range.Amadio et al. 2006. Abundance of Adult Saugers across the Wind River Watershed, Wyoming. North American Journal of Fisheries Management. 26: 156-162. American Fisheries Society. 2006. ==Reproduction and life cycle== Saugers generally move upstream to spawn during March–May depending on where their home locations are. They move downstream to their home locations from April–July after their spawning period is over. Saugers have been known to travel between 10 and 600 km from their home to spawning location downstream. Habitat at spawning sites are less complex and diverse than home locations. Females prefer rocky substrate and pools to deposit their eggs. As females increase in length, egg quality and fecundity increase. However, it is thought that egg production begins to decline after age 6 in female sauger.Graeb, Brian D.S., Mark A. Kaemingk, David W. Willis. 2007. Early Life History of Sauger in Missouri River Reservoirs. Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences. Brookings, SD. Sexual maturity is reached between 2 and 5 years old. Other measures of sexual maturity are related to size. A sauger is considered to be an adult when it reaches 250–300 mm. Upon birth, larval saugers drift downstream before developing feeding tendencies and horizontal maneuverability. Juvenile saugers tend to develop in diversion canals and backwaters until autumn when they migrate upstream to their wintering habitat. Residing in diversion canals is a large source of mortality for juvenile saugers. ==Diet== Sauger feed on a variety of invertebrates and small fishes depending on the time of year and size of the sauger. Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and freshwater drum Pylodictus olivaris are a midsize (300–379 mm) and large (>379 mm) sauger's main food source during spring. The diet of a small sauger (200–299 mm) is slightly different than a larger sauger's. Smaller saugers generally feed on benthic invertebrates, mayfly larvae, and catfish during spring and summer. Mid-size and large saugers feed mainly on fish from spring to autumn, but their diets alter during summer. Mid-size and large saugers feed predominantly on mayfly larvae but only during summer months. Freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens and gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum are dominant food sources for saugers of all sizes during autumn. Fish accounted for over 99% of a sauger's diet during autumn. Saugers also prey on shiners during spring and summer but they do not account for a significant part of their diet. Shiners are absent from a sauger's diet in autumn probably due to their availability.Wickstrom, Gerald A. 2006. Seasonal Distribution, Movement, and Food Habits of Walleye and Sauger in Lewis and Clark Lake. South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks. Chamberlain, South Dakota. ==Habitat== Sauger are most likely to be found in large rivers with deep pools with depths greater than 0.6 m. Pools with depths less than 0.6 m are not likely to yield saugers. They encounter a variety of habitats because of their migratory tendencies. They are usually found in natural rivers because they have more abundant pools and their flow regime has not been altered by dams or diversions. They are still common in impounded river systems. Diversions and dams affect habitat and spawning areas of Saugers. Saugers are usually found in areas with high turbidity, low channel slope, low stream velocity, and deep water. Saugers tend to select pools with sand and silt substrates, and habitat features that provide cover from the river current. They tend to avoid runs and riffles. They are most commonly found in pools that are at least 1.5 m deep. They can also be found in shallower pools but in lesser numbers. There have been no observed differences in habitat preference for males and females. The amount of saugers observed will increase with mean summer water temperature, maximum water depth, and mean summer alkalinity. ==Taxonomy== Alongside the walleye, the sauger forms the North American clade within the genus Sander and it is thought that the sauger first speciated into its modern form about 7.3 million years ago. The sauger was first formally described as Lucioperca canadensis in 1834 by the British naturalists and explorers Edward Griffith (1790-1858) and Charles Hamilton Smith (1776-1859) based on the work of the French naturalist and anatomist Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) which Griffith translated from the French. ==Conservation== Saugers face many conservation issues because of migratory barriers, habitat loss, entrainment in irrigation canals, and overexploitation. Dams and diversion canals prevent spawning in upstream habitats. Altering flow regimes in rivers affects turbidity, formation of pools, and temperature. All of which are important for the timing and success of spawning saugers. Long migrations are the main reason why saugers struggle in dammed or diverted river systems. Low water levels in periods of drought are the most detrimental to sauger populations because it strands eggs during spawning and prevents larval sauger from reaching their downstream locations. High death rates that occur during spawning are related to degraded and fragmented river systems. Mortality rates in autumn are related to exploitation by fishermen. ==References== * ==External links== *Fishbase information on Sauger *Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks *Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks *Lake-Link.com *Sauger Fishing in the Tennessee Valley *Saugeye Category:Sander (fish) Category:Freshwater fish of North America Category:Freshwater fish of the United States Category:Fish of the Eastern United States Category:Fish of the Western United States Category:Fish of the Great Lakes Category:Fish described in 1834 Category:Taxa named by Edward Griffith (zoologist) ","title":"Sauger"},{"id":"2001952","text":"Katy Lynn Taylor (born October 22, 1989) is an American figure skater.

Global manufacturing has changed the environment in which goods are produced. Meanwhile, the rapid development of electronics and communication technologies has required design and manufacturing to keep pace. ==Description of CAPE== CAPE is seen as a new type of computer-aided engineering environment which will improve the productivity of manufacturing/industrial engineers. This environment would be used by engineers to design and implement future manufacturing systems and subsystems. Work is currently underway at the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on CAPE systems. The NIST project is aimed at advancing the development of software environments and tools for the design and engineering of manufacturing systems. ==CAPE and the Future of Manufacturing== The future of manufacturing will be determined by the efficiency with which it can incorporate new technologies. The current process in engineering manufacturing systems is often ad hoc, with computerized tools being used on a limited basis. Given the costs and resources involved in the construction and operation of manufacturing systems, the engineering process must be made more efficient. New computing environments for engineering manufacturing systems could help achieve that objective. Why is CAPE important? In much the same way that product designers need computer-aided design systems, manufacturing and industrial engineers need sophisticated computing capabilities to solve complex problems and manage the vast data associated with the design of a manufacturing system. In order to solve these complex problems and manage design data, computerized tools must be used in the application of scientific and engineering methods to the problem of the design and implementation of manufacturing systems. Engineers must address the entire factory as a system and the interactions of that system with its surrounding environment. Components of a factory system include: * the physical plant housing the manufacturing facility; * the production facilities which perform the manufacturing operations; * the technologies used in the production facility; * the work centers/stations, machinery, equipment, tools, and materials which comprise or are used by the production facilities; * the various support facilities; * the relationship between the factory and its environment. CAPE must not only be concerned with the initial design and engineering of the factory, it must also address enhancements over time. CAPE should support standard engineering methods and problem-solving techniques, automate mundane tasks, and provide reference data to support the decision-making process. The environment should be designed to help engineers become more productive and effective in their work. This would be implemented on personal computers or engineering workstations which have been configured with appropriate peripheral devices. Engineering tool developers will have to integrate the functions and data used by a number of different disciplines, for example: * manufacturing, industrial and plant engineering; * materials processing and quality engineering; * environmental engineering, * mathematical modeling/simulation, statistical process control and computer science, * economic and cost analysis and management science, Many of the methods, formulas, and data associated with these technical areas currently exist only in engineering handbooks. Although some computerized tools are available, they are often very specialized, difficult to use, and do not share information or work together. Engineering tools built by different vendors must be made compatible through open systems architectures and interface standards. ==What CAPE will look like== CAPE will be based upon computer systems providing an integrated set of design and engineering tools. These software tools will be used by a company’s manufacturing engineers to continuously improve its production systems. They will maintain information about manufacturing resources, enhance production capabilities, and develop new facilities and systems. Engineers working on different workstations will share information through a common database. Using CAPE, an engineering team will prepare detailed plans and working models for an entire factory in a matter of days. Alternative solutions to production problems could be quickly developed and evaluated. This would be a significant improvement over current manual methods which may require weeks or months of intensive activity. To achieve this goal, a new set of engineering tools are needed. Examples of functions which should be supported include: * identification of product specifications and production requirements; * producibility analysis for products and modification of product designs to address manufacturability issues and management, scheduling and tracking of projects; * modeling and specification of manufacturing processes and plant layout and facilities planning; * consideration of various economic/cost tradeoffs of different manufacturing processes, systems, tools, and materials; * analysis supporting selection of systems/vendors and procurement of manufacturing equipment and support systems; * task and work place design; * compliance with various regulations, specifications, and standards, and control of hazardous materials. The tools implementing these functions must be highly automated and integrated; and will need to provide quick access to a wide range of data. This data must be maintained in a format that is accessible and usable by the engineering tools. Some examples of the information that might be contained in these electronic libraries include: * production process models and data and generic manufacturing systems configurations; * machinery and equipment specifications, and vendor catalogs; * recommended methods, practices, algorithms, etc., and benchmarking data; * typical plant/system layouts, * cost estimation models, labor rates, other cost data and budget templates, * time standards, industrial standards, project plans, and laws/government regulations. These on-line libraries would allow engineers to quickly develop solutions based upon the work of others. Another critical aspect of this engineering environment is affordability, which can best be achieved by designing an environment that can be constructed from low cost \\"off-the-shelf\\" commercial products, rather than custombuilt computer hardware and software. The basic engineering environment must be affordable. For both cost and technical reasons, it must be designed to be able to support incremental upgrades. Incremental upgrades would allow companies to add capabilities as they are needed. Commercial software products must be easy to install and integrate with other software already in use. These capabilities exist to a limited extent in some general purpose commercial software today, e.g., word processors, databases, spreadsheets. ==Technical Concerns== Many technical issues must be considered in the design and development of new engineering tools for CAPE. These issues include: * required functionality of the tools themselves; * formalization and refinement of engineering methods; * development of on-line technical reference libraries, and user engineering and graphics visualization; * user engineering and graphics visualization techniques; * system connectivity and information sharing, and integration standards for the computing environment; * incorporation of intelligent behavior in the tools. There are three critical elements to be addressed: creating a common manufacturing systems information model; using an engineering life cycle approach; and developing a software tool integration framework. Resolution of these elements will help ensure that independently developed systems will be able to work together. The common information model should identify the elements of the manufacturing system and their relationships to each other; the functions or processes performed by each element; the tools, materials, and information required to perform those functions; and measures of effectiveness for the model and its component elements. There have been many efforts over the years to develop information models for different aspects of manufacturing, but no known existing model fully meets the needs of a CAPE ernviroment. Therefore, a life cycle approach is needed to identify the different processes that a CAPE environment must support, and must define all phases of a manufacturing system or subsystem’s existence. Some of the major phases which may be included in a system life cycle approach are, requirements identification; system design specification; vendor selection; system development and upgrades; installation, testing, and training; and benchmarking of production operations. Management, coordination, and administration functions need to be performed during each phase of the life cycle. Phases may be repeated over time as a system is upgraded or re- engineered to meet changing needs or incorporate new technologies. A software tool integration framework should specify how the tools could be independently designed and developed. The framework would define how CAPE tools would deal with common services, interact with each other and coordinate problem solving activities. Although some existing software products and standards currently address the common services issue, the problem of tool interaction remains largely unsolved. The problem of tool interaction is not limited to the domain of computer-aided manufacturing systems engineering—it is pervasive across the software industry. ==CAPE's current state== An initial CAPE environment has been established from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software packages. This new environment is being used to demonstrate commercially available tools to perform CAPE functions, to develop a better understanding and define functional requirements for individual engineering tools and the overall environment, and to identify the integration issues which must be addressed to implement compatible environments in the future. Several engineering demonstrations using COTS tools are under development. These demonstrations are designed to illustrate the various types of functions that must be performed in engineering a manufacturing system. Functions supported by the current COTS environment include: system specification/diagramming, process flowcharting, information modeling, computer-aided design of products, plant layout, material flow analysis, ergonomic workplace design, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, line balancing, manufacturing simulation, investment analysis, project management, knowledge-based system development, spreadsheets, document preparation, user interface development, document illustration, forms and database management. ==Notes== :# CAPE :# NIST Study :# NIST Study :# NIST Study :# NIST Study :# NIST Study ==Sources== :# J.P.

On 1 October 2003 the merger of EnBW with Neckarwerke Stuttgart AG took place. EnBW was the main sponsor of football-clubs VfB Stuttgart (2005–2010) and Karlsruher SC. Currently it is sponsor of both clubs on a lower level. EnBW is also name- and main sponsor of Volleyball-Bundesliga-club EnBW TV Rottenburg and Beko Basketball-Bundesliga-club EnBW Ludwigsburg. In January 2015, EnBW sold a stake in its Baltic 2 offshore wind park to the Australian investment group Macquarie Group for a fee totalling €720 million, due for completion in summer 2016 and subject to antitrust approval. EnBW sells offshore windpark stake to Macquarie for 720 million euros. Reuters, 8 January 2015 In 2017, EnBW won the right for the 900 MW He Dreiht offshore wind farm in 2025 with zero subsidy. ==Structure== EnBW headquarters in Karlsruhe ===Shareholders=== The two principal shareholders of EnBW are NECKARPRI-Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, with a 46.55% share and Oberschwäbischen Elektrizitätswerke (OEW), with a 46.55% share. The two shareholders agreed to keep the share ratios as they are and to vote in mutual agreement on important decisions. ===Figures=== About 6 million customers make EnBW the third-largest utilities company in Germany. With just under 24,600 employees an annual turnover of approximately 10.6 billion euro was generated in 2003. After the first mid-year 2004 19,500 coworkers remained generating a turnover of approximately €5.8 billion. ==== Carbon intensity ==== {| |year !Production (TWh) !Emission (Gt CO2) !kg CO2/MWh |---- !2002 |65 |16.8 |258 |---- !2003 |75 |20.9 |277 |---- !2004 |73 |19.2 |263 |---- !2005 |74 |17.8 |242 |---- !2006 |75 |18.1 |241 |---- !2007 |74 |17.7 |241 |---- !2008 |67 |17.0 |254 |---- !2009 |66 |15.9 |241 |---- |} ===Facilities=== Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant ====Power plants==== Rheinhafen-Dampfkraftwerk Karlsruhe * Fossile Altbach Power Station * Steam power plant Heilbronn Power Station * Steam power plant Marbach am Neckar * Turbine power plant Walheim * Steam power plant Stuttgart-Gaisburg * Steam power plant Stuttgart-Münster * Coal and gas turbine plant Rheinhafen-Dampfkraftwerk Karlsruhe * Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant * Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant * Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant * Pumped-storage plant Glems (Metzingen) * Pumped storage plant Schluchsee * Hydroelectric power plant Rheinfelden * Baltic 1 Offshore Wind Farm ====Power lines==== * Eyachtal Span: overhead line crossing the Eyachtal (facility 615) (high voltage transmission line with largest span in Germany) * facility 0704 (disconnected 110kV-three phase AC powerline near Gomaringen) * facility 9461 (disconnected 110kV-three phase AC powerline near Göppingen) A further special feature is, that on many powerlines of EnBW, which were built by former EVS before 1985 the aerial cable for telecommunication is installed like a garland on the ground conductor or an auxiliary rope.

It was a helmet made of bronze which in its later styles covered the entire head and neck, with slits for the eyes and mouth. A large curved projection protected the nape of the neck. Out of combat, a Greek hoplite would wear the helmet tipped upward for comfort. This practice gave rise to a series of variant forms in Italy, where the slits were almost closed, since the helmet was no longer pulled over the face but worn cap-like. Although the classical Corinthian helmet fell out of use among the Greeks in favour of more open types, the Italo-Corinthian types remained in use until the 1st century AD, being used, among others, by the Roman army. == Physical evidence == Italo-Corinthian helmet, Getty Villa Leucippus on a coin, with Corinthian helmet Apparently (judging from artistic and archaeological evidence) the most popular helmet during the Archaic and early Classical periods, the style gradually gave way to the more open Thracian helmet, Chalcidian helmet and the much simpler pilos type, which was less expensive to manufacture and did not obstruct the wearer's critical senses of vision and hearing as the Corinthian helmet did. Numerous examples of Corinthian helmets have been excavated, and they are frequently depicted on pottery. The Corinthian helmet was depicted on more sculpture than any other helmet; it seems the Greeks romantically associated it with glory and the past. The Romans also revered it, from copies of Greek originals to sculpture of their own. Based on the sparse pictorial evidence of the republican Roman army, in Italy the Corinthian helmet evolved into a jockey-cap style helmet called the Italo-Corinthian, Etrusco-Corinthian or Apulo-Corinthian helmet, with the characteristic nose guard and eye slits becoming mere decorations on its face.Peter Connolly: The Roman Army, pp. 19 and 35. Macdonald & Company, Ltd., London, 1975. . Given many Roman appropriations of ancient Greek ideas, this change was probably inspired by the \\"over the forehead\\" position common in Greek art. This helmet remained in use well into the 1st century AD. == Literary evidence == Ancient Greek helmets. Top line, left to right: Illyrian type helmet, Corinthian helmet. Bottom line, left to right: Phrygian type helmet, Pilos, Chalcidian helmet.

The tribes chose annually two teams of the fairest maidens who fought each other ceremonially with sticks and stones. They were dressed in the finest Greek panoply topped off with a Corinthian helmet. The ritual fight was part of a festival honoring the virgin goddess Athena. Young women who succumbed to their wounds during the ordeal were thought to have been punished by the goddess for lying about their virginity (Histories, 4.180). == References  Further reading == * Lendon, J.E., Soldiers and Ghosts, A History of Battle in Classical Antiquity (2005) == External links == * Herodotus's (4.180.3) account of the Libyan female warriors in Corinthian helmets - via the Perseus Project * Collection of Corinthian helmets from around the world Category:Ancient Greek helmets Helmet Category:Archaic Greece Category:Magna Graecia ","title":"Corinthian helmet"},{"id":"2001990","text":"Rosetta is a dynamic binary translator developed by Apple Inc. for macOS, an application compatibility layer between different CPU architectures. It gives developers and consumers a transition period in which to update their application software to run on newer hardware. The first version of Rosetta, introduced in 2006, allows PowerPC applications to run on Intel-based Macs. The second version, introduced in 2020, is a component of macOS Big Sur to aid in the Mac transition to Apple Silicon from Intel processors. The name \\"Rosetta\\" is a reference to the Rosetta Stone, the artifact which enabled translation of Egyptian hieroglyphs.Core Duo iMacs debut speedy new chips == Rosetta == Apple released the first version of Rosetta in 2006 when it changed the instruction set architecture of the Macintosh platform from the PowerPC to the Intel processor. It was initially included with Mac OS X v10.4.4 \\"Tiger\\", the version that was released with the first Intel-based Macs, and allows many PowerPC applications to run on certain Intel-based Mac computers without modification. Rosetta is based on QuickTransit technology. It has no graphical user interface, which led Apple to describe Rosetta as \\"the most amazing software you'll never see\\". Rosetta is not installed by default in Mac OS X v10.6 \\"Snow Leopard\\", but can be retained as an option via the installer or Apple Software Update. Rosetta is neither included nor supported in Mac OS X v10.7 \\"Lion\\" or later, which therefore cannot run PowerPC applications. Rosetta translates G3, G4, and AltiVec instructions, but not G5 instructions. Although most commercial software for PowerPC-based Macs were compatible with these requirements, any applications that relied on G5-specific instruction sets had to be modified by their developers to work on Rosetta-supported Intel-based Macs. Apple advised that applications with heavy user interaction but low computational needs (such as word processors) would be best suited to Rosetta, while applications with high computational needs (such as AutoCAD, games, or Adobe Photoshop) would not. Rosetta also does not support the following: * The Classic environment, and thus any non-Carbon application built for Mac OS 9 or earlier * Code that inserts preferences into the System Preferences pane * Applications that require precise exception handling * Screen savers *Kernel extensions and applications that depend on them * Bundled Java applications or Java applications with JNI libraries that cannot be translated * Java applets in Rosetta-translated applications, meaning that a native Intel web browser application, rather than a legacy PowerPC version, must be used to load Java applets The reason for Rosetta's reduced compatibility compared to Apple's earlier 68k emulator for PPCs lies within its implementation. Rosetta is a user-level program and can only intercept and emulate user-level code. By contrast, the 68k emulator accesses the very lowest levels of the OS by being at the same level as, and tightly connected to, the Mac OS nanokernel on PPC Macs, which means that the nanokernel is able to intercept PowerPC interrupts, translate them to 68k interrupts (then doing a mixed mode switch, if necessary), and then execute 68k code to handle the interrupts. This allows lines of 68k and PPC code to be interspersed within the same fat binary. == Rosetta 2 == Rosetta 2 is included as of macOS Big Sur to aid in the Mac transition to Apple Silicon from Intel processors. In addition to the just-in-time (JIT) translation support available in Rosetta, Rosetta 2 includes support for translating an application at installation time. ==See also== * Universal binary – combined PPC/Intel applications that run natively on both processors * – combined PPC/68k application that ran on older Macintoshes ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Rosetta compatibility index Category:MacOS-only software made by Apple Inc.

He was the eldest son of Richard Prosser, the Birmingham, England, engineer and inventor. R. B. Prosser was educated at University College School, London where he was a fellow pupil of Joseph Chamberlain. Richard Prosser was heavily involved with the introduction of the Patent Law Amendment Act 1852, and his 700-volume library, combined with that of Bennet Woodcroft,(1803-1879) formed the basis of the Patent Office Library, which opened on 5 March 1854. Richard Prosser died in 1854; in 1856 R. B. Prosser joined the Office of the Commissioners of Patents, London, where he later rose to become Chief Examiner. He was forced to retire early, in 1888, because of partial blindness, but continued to take an active part in local government and church life in St Pancras, London, where he lived. He was much involved in national Church of England organisations. He married Anne Ostell, daughter of William Ostell of Bloomsbury, London; she died in 1911. They had a daughter and three sons. R. B. Prosser was greatly interested in technical history, and in particular the biographies of inventors. This was due to his work on patents, where he needed to be able to assess the priority of them - a knowledge of patents history was vital for this. He wrote 58 lives for the Dictionary of National Biography, and supplied much material for the New English Dictionary. Prosser also wrote Birmingham Inventors and Inventions, 1881, in a limited edition of 50 copies. This was a cumulation of notes he had published earlier in the Birmingham Gazette. A similar work on Manchester inventors was never finished. His 315 contributions to 'St Pancras Notes and Queries' in the St. Pancras Guardian between 3 February 1897 and 2 January 1903 were later published in a book of 150 copies. He was a frequent contributor to Notes and Queries, as well as to technical periodicals. Prosser had in mind to write a history of invention, written around the abstracts of British Patent Specifications, but the project never got further than the planning stage. Prosser died, aged 79. His library was dispersed by auction, and his files of biographical notes were sold for about £50. They surfaced again in the 1970s, to be bought by the British Library, Dept of Manuscripts, Add Ms 54,496 - 54,507. They comprise 24 volumes and cover over 1600 names. More of Prosser's papers are in Birmingham and Manchester reference libraries, having been presented either by himself in his lifetime or by his family after his death. The on-line catalogue of the National Archives lists small collections of Prosser's papers for patentees in the South West of England, Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. These might be part of his history of inventions project, noted above. Prosser was a pioneer of the study of technical history, and his published biographies and manuscript records are an incomparable source for present-day researchers. ==References== * Anon, 'Some appreciations of Richard Bissell Prosser', 1918, privately printed, 18 pp (Reprints obituaries from: Engineering, The Engineer, Notes and Queries, The Birmingham Daily Post, The Guardian, The Church Times, Free and Open Church Association, The Church Union Gazette, Kentish Town Parish Magazine) * Charles E.

In October 2019, the building was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum certification for environmental sustainability by the U.S. Green Building Council. ==History== Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) with Pietro Belluschi as the consultant, the tower cost $60 million to construct. Ground was broken on May 29, 1981,Brennan, Tom (May 30, 1981). \\"U.S. Bancorp begins 'staggering' tower\\". The Oregonian, p.

The Oregonian, p. G2. A tower expected to rise about 37 stories was already part of the bank's long-term site plans at that earlier date, but that phase of the plans ended up being delayed until the 1980s. Originally, the building served as the national headquarters of U.S. Bancorp, and was the regional headquarters of that organization until a 1997 merger moved the corporate offices to Minneapolis, Minnesota. As of 2004, U.S. Bancorp had leased until 2015. During the 1980s and 1990s, the top floors held the headquarters of Louisiana-Pacific. Since a $4 million renovation in 2002, the 30th floor of the tower has been occupied by the Portland City Grill, Portland's top-grossing restaurant. It has been cited as the restaurant with the best view in Portland. In 2000, the U.S. Bancorp Tower was sold for a price of $165 million to a partnership of three firms: Unico Properties, JPMorgan and Wafra Investment Advisory Group. In 2004, a majority stake in the tower was acquired by California-based Broadreach Capital Partners LLC, which bought-out JPMorgan and Wafra, but Unico continued to own 25 percent. At that time, 92 percent of the building was leased. In August 2006, a majority stake in the building was purchased by \\"institutional investors advised by JPMorgan Asset Management\\" for a price of $286 million. In 2008 LaSalle Investment Management purchased a majority stake in the building from Unico Properties; the building had an estimated value of $285 million at the time. LaSalle sold their stake in 2015, to TPF Equity REIT that is majority-owned by UBS. Unico Properties retains a minority share in the building. The sale price was $372.5 million, a record for any office building in the Portland area. ==Design== Perhaps the most unusual features of the U.S. Bancorp Tower are its shape and color. Pietro Belluschi was most concerned about the play of light and shadows on its surface; meanwhile, the SOM team had to work with a uniquely shaped lot due to the street grid. Because of the street grid, the tower features no right angles in its parallelogram footprint. This, in turn, makes it look either extremely slender or wide depending upon one's viewing angle. Belluschi carefully selected the glass and granite for the exterior facing. The pink granite covering the building was quarried in Spain. The Pittsburgh Plate Glass used for the windows is also pink, an effect caused by its being \\"glazed in a semitransparent coating of copper and silver that looks pink from the outside\\". The windows can absorb or reflect light depending upon how much light is upon them, while the surrounding granite may appear darker or lighter than the window panes, depending upon the time of day. The unusual color earned the building the nickname \\"Big Pink\\". From 2013 to 2015, the entire building underwent interior design renovation. In October 2019, the building achieved the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum certification for environmental sustainability from the U.S. Green Building Council.

It is akin to the arabesque in ballet. Spiral positions are classified according to the skating leg (left or right), edge (outside or inside), direction the skater is traveling (forward or backward), and the position of the free leg (backward, forward, sideways).ISU Communication No.1445 Spirals were a required element in ladies' singles and pair skating prior to the 2012–13 season. Spirals were infrequently performed by men at the Olympic level prior to the 2012–13 season because it was not a required element nor could men receive points for spiral sequences in the element score of the ISU Judging System. In spite of this, some male skaters are known for their spirals, such as Toller Cranston, Paul Wylie, and Shawn Sawyer. ==Edging and technique== The name \\"Spiral\\" is indicative of the skating edge. This move is generally (but not exclusively) demonstrated on a deep inside or outside edge. As the skater moves, he or she glides slightly to the left or right (depending on the edge used), and continues in a spiral pattern around the ice if held long enough. Spirals can be performed on four edges: forward or backward, and on the inside or outside edge. Spirals performed on a \\"flat\\" (no lean) are generally not counted as \\"true\\" spirals. The basic spiral is performed with the free leg stretched and extended to the rear above hip level. Many skaters try to lift the leg as high as possible, but more important than the height of the free leg is that it be fully stretched and that the tension of the position be maintained in the upper body as well. Judges look at the depth, stability, and control of the skating edge, speed and ice coverage, extension, and other factors. Some skaters are able to change edges during a spiral. Michelle Kwan was known for her change-of-edge spiral, in which she maintained a fixed arabesque position while changing from an inside to outside edge. ==Spiral sequence== A \\"spiral sequence\\" is a series of spiral moves performed together. The spiral sequence was a required element for ladies and pairs in international competition prior to the 2012–13 season; under the rules for the ISU Judging System, the skater must have held each spiral position for at least 3 seconds to have received credit for it. A spiral sequence often included a change of edge spiral. The same spiral position was held, but the skater changed the edge he or she was skating on. The most common was forward inside edge to forward outside edge.Figure Skating Journal Glossary From the 2012–13 season and onward, the spiral sequence was replaced by the choreographic sequence.http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/TN%20103%20Singles%20Choreographic%20Sequence%206%2021%2012.pdf The choreographic sequence is required for men's, ladies' and pairs' free skating. The choreographic sequence consist of moves in the field, unlisted jumps, spinning movements, etc.https://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair-skating- ice-dance/isu-judging-system-fs/isu-handbooks-faq-sandp-skating-2/17595-tp- handbook-pair-skating-2018-19/filehttps://www.isu.org/inside-single-pair- skating-ice-dance/isu-judging-system-fs/isu-handbooks-faq-sandp- skating-2/17594-tp-handbook-singles-2018-19/file ==Variations== Spirals can also be performed in other positions, such as with the free leg extended forward or to the side, with a bent knee, or with the leg, knee, or skate supported with one or both hands. There are many variations and some names, while not necessarily official, have come into common use. An arabesque spiral is the basic spiral position. The free leg is extended behind the body above hip height (at least a 90 degree angle). Some skaters are able to achieve vertical (180 degrees) with this position, but it is not required. A catch- foot spiral does not refer to any single position, but generally refers to any spiral with the skate of the free leg being held in one or both hands. Catchfoot spirals include: :The Biellmann spiral is performed with the free leg grasped from behind and pulled overhead in the Biellmann position. This spiral may be performed on any of the spiral edges. :A cross-grab spiral is a catch-foot spiral with the skate of the free leg grasped from behind by the opposite hand (e.g. right skate held by the left hand, left skate held by the right hand) :A Y-spiral also known as a 180 because your legs are at a 180 degree angle is performed with the skate of the free leg held out to the side. This is usually performed as a catch-foot spiral, although some skaters have increased the difficulty of this position by releasing the foot and holding the leg position unsupported. A Charlotte spiral is a variation in which the torso is dropped down forward toward the skating leg and the free leg is lifted behind in a near-split position. A Kerrigan spiral is a high-leg outside spiral performed with one hand supporting the knee of the free leg. This position is named after Nancy Kerrigan. A skid spiral (also known as a slide spiral) is a difficult 180-degree turn on the ice performed in a spiral position, using a skidden three turn to change directions. It was invented by Robin Cousins, and is notably performed by Sasha Cohen and Evgenia Medvedeva. A fan spiral is a back outside edge spiral held with the free leg held unsupported to the skater's front or side. Ideally, this position should be held with both legs straight, although less flexible skaters attempt to compensate for a lack of strength or flexibility by not fully extending the free leg or bending the skating leg. An inverted spiral is a variation performed with the free leg held in front with the skater leaning backward over the edge of the skating foot so that the skater's upper body is held almost parallel to the ice. The position attained in this spiral is similar to that of a layover camel. ==Photo gallery Single skating == Catch- foot spiral positions ==== Image:Mirai Nagasu 2010 Trophée Eric Bompard.JPG|Two-handed Biellmann spiral (Side view) (Mirai Nagasu) Image:Kim 2009 Skate America FS Spiral.jpg|One-handed Biellmann spiral (Front view) (Yuna Kim) Image:WC2008 SPLadies Asada JPN 1.jpg|Cross-grab one-hand Biellmann spiral (Mao Asada) Image:Diane Szmiett Spiral 2008-2009 JGPF.jpg|Catch-foot spiral (Diane Szmiett) Image:Kostner 2008GPF by Carmichael.jpg|Cross-grab catch-foot spiral (Front view) (Carolina Kostner) Image:Kwak 2009.jpg|135 leg lift/spiral (Kwak Min-jeong) Image:2011 WFSC 6d 075 Elene Gedevanishvili.JPG|One-handed I-position spiral (Elene Gedevanishvili) Image:Mao Asada 2009 World Championships Spiral.jpg|Kerrigan spiral (Front view) (Mao Asada) Image:Joannie Rochette Spiral - 2006 Skate Canada.jpg|Kerrigan spiral (Side view) (Joannie Rochette) Image:Caroline Zhang Spiral 2008 Skate Canada.jpg|Variation on Kerrigan spiral (Caroline Zhang) ==== Unassisted spiral positions ==== Image:Mao Asada Spiral Grand Prix Final 2008.jpg|Fan spiral (side view) (Mao Asada) Image:Jenni Vahamaa 2008 Junior Worlds.jpg|Arabesque spiral (Right forward outside edge) (Jenni Vähämaa) Image:Shawn Sawyer Spiral 2008 Skate Canada.jpg|A male skater performing an arabesque spiral (Front view) (Shawn Sawyer) Image:Sasha Cohen charlotte spiral.jpg|Charlotte spiral (Sasha Cohen) ===Pair skating=== Image:SawtschenkoSzolkowy 1.jpg|Catchfoot and arabesque (Aliona Savchenko & Robin Szolkowy) Image:Marcoux buntin.jpg|Pair arabesque spiral (Valerie Marcoux & Craig Buntin) Image:Elena Efaieva & Alexei Menshikov - 2006 Skate America.jpg|Pair arabesque spiral (Elena Efaieva & Alexei Menshikov) Image:Nam & Leftheris Spiral - 2006 Skate America.jpg|Pair fan spirals (Naomi Nari Nam & Themistocles Leftheris) Image:Lubov ILIUSHECHKINA Nodari MAISURADZE Skate Canada 2010.jpg|Pair fan spirals (Lubov Iliushechkina & Nodari Maisuradze Image:Maria Mukhortova & Maxim Trankov - 2006 Skate America.jpg|Pair Biellmann spirals (Maria Mukhortova & Maxim Trankov) Image:AljonaSavchenko RobinSzolkowy GER FP NH2007 3.JPG|Pair Y-spirals (Aliona Savchenko & Robin Szolkowy) File:Lubov ILIUSHECHKINA Nodari MAISURADZE EC 2009.jpg|Y and catch-foot (Lubov Iliushechkina & Nodari Maisuradze) File:Keauna McLaughlin & Rockne Brubaker Spiral 2009 4CC.jpg|Pair catch-foot (Keauna McLaughlin & Rockne Brubaker) === Synchronized skating === File:Lexettes spirals.jpg|(The Lexettes) File:Colonials spiral.jpg|(The Colonials) File:Skyliners spirals.jpg|(The Skyliners) ==References== Category:Figure skating elements ","title":"Figure skating spirals"},{"id":"2002010","text":"Fortycoats & Co. was an Irish children's television drama series produced by RTÉ and broadcast on RTÉ One during the 1980s. The series was cancelled in the early 1990s. ==Plot== The show featured the adventures of the title character Fortycoats (Fran Dempsey) - his catchphrase was \\"Be me forty coats and me fifty pockets\\" - and his companions Sofar Sogood (played by Conal Kearney), a prim goody two shoes character and Slightly Bonkers (played by Virginia Cole), a naive schoolgirl. They occupied the Flying Trick Shop (also known as the Flying Tuck Shop and the Flying Sweet Shop) and battled against the evil Whilomena, the Whirligig Witch (and her cat, Spooky) and the equally evil Pickarooney (who lived in a rubbish tip and kidnapped children). ==CastMain cast=== * Fran Dempsey as Fortycoats * Virginia Cole as Slightly Bonkers * Conal Kearney as Sofar Sogood ===Guest Cast=== * Laurie Morton as Whilomena, The Whirligig Witch * Des Nealon as The Pickarooney * Robert Carrickford as The CountRTE Archive: Robert Carrickford as The Count * Noel McGee as Timothy TumbledownRTE Archive: Noel McGee as Timothy Tumbledown * Maria McDermottroe as The LilterRTE Archive: Maria McDermottroe as The Lilter * Derry Power as Tony the TailorRTE Archive: Derry Power as Tony the Tailor * Fiona MacGinty as Queen Roola Boola * Vincent Smith as Utterly Bonkers * Annie Kilmartin as Totally Bonkers * Barbara McNamara as The Princess * Gerry O'Brien as Sir Dashing the BoldRTE Archive: Cast Picture ===Voice actors=== *Paula Lambert as Spooky the CatRTE Archive: Spooky the Cat * Davy Byrne as Demented Chicken ==ProductionOrigins of Fortycoats=== The name Johnny Fortycoats first appears in Dublin folklore in the 1930s. It may perhaps have been applied to more than one person, including one of a couple of tramps who walked the coast of Dublin at the time of the television series. A wild looking man, well recognized in the city centre and harmless as anyone knew. He was far removed from the world of television. It was his habit to wear several coats, hence the nickname. ===Wanderly Wagon=== The show was a spin- off from Wanderly Wagon, in which Fortycoats was played by Bill Golding, who also played Rory. The in joke of the programme was that Fortycoats only ever visited in his flying sweetshop when Rory had gone off on some errand and Rory seemed to doubt Fortycoats existence because he never met him. When Goulding left the series, Fran Dempsey took over the heavily disguised role of Fortycoats but not that of Rory, who was written out. Eugene Lambert (creator of Wanderly Wagon) said he had no involvement with the spin-off and described it as \\"a rehash of our program\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Fortycoats & Co. clip Category:Irish children's television shows Category:Irish television shows featuring puppetry Category:RTÉ original programming ","title":"Fortycoats &amp; Co."},{"id":"2002022","text":"KKLQ (100.3 FM, \\"Positive, Encouraging 100.3\\") is a non-commercial radio station that is owned by Educational Media Foundation (EMF) and carries the contemporary Christian music format of its nationally syndicated network K-Love throughout the Greater Los Angeles area. Licensed to Los Angeles, California, KKLQ's transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson and has a booster in Santa Clarita, KKLQ-FM2 at 100.3 MHz, to extend its coverage into the Santa Clarita Valley and other areas north of Los Angeles. From 2008 through 2017, the station broadcast a classic rock format (though it initially aired an adult album alternative format) under the brand 100.3 The Sound as KSWD. In 2017, station owner Entercom announced its merger with CBS Radio. In order to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership caps, Entercom retained CBS Radio's pre-existing Los Angeles cluster but divested KSWD to EMF, who assumed control of the station on November 16, 2017 and flipped it to K-Love programming. The former broadcast studios of The Sound were located on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles. KKLQ is not affiliated with KLVE, a Spanish-language radio station which has used the name \\"K-Love\\" in the Los Angeles market continuously since 1974 and holds the trademark locally. Prior to assuming control of KKLQ, EMF reached an agreement with Univision Radio (now known as Uforia Audio Network), owner of KLVE, that allows KKLQ to use the K-Love brand on-air as part of networked content, but requires local promotion to disambiguate itself from KLVE. ==HistoryEarly years=== 100.3 FM in Los Angeles signed on as KMLA at 8a.m. on July 1, 1957. The station broadcast good music and news, with no more than two commercials per half-hour. The KMLA Broadcasting Corporation, the original owner of the station, filed to sell it to KFOX, Inc., owner of KFOX (1280 AM) in Long Beach, in November 1964. The station changed its call letters to KVXN in January and again in April, after the sale was completed, to KFOX-FM, at which time it began simulcasting KFOX's country music format. ===KIQQ=== In 1972, KFOX, Inc. traded its two Los Angeles stations and $3.45 million to the Industrial Broadcasting Company in exchange for KIKK AM and FM in Pasadena, Texas, near Houston. Industrial then split the KFOX stations apart; the AM went to the John Walton group, while KFOX-FM was sold to Cosmic Communications. The new ownership changed the FM station's call letters to KIQQ (\\"K-100\\") in an attempt to capitalize on its 100.3 MHz dial location. The following year, with the station's soft rock format failing to gain ratings or billing, KIQQ brought in deposed KHJ heavyweights Bill Drake and Gene Chenault, who contracted to program and manage the station. In spite of bringing in former KHJ powerhouse jocks, including Robert W. Morgan and The Real Don Steele, certain management and programming decisions are believed to have led to the demise of Drake-Chenault's run at KIQQ. By 1975, Morgan and Steele were gone. Ultimately, the station cut costs drastically by airing a generic national format via satellite. Station logo as \\"K-Lite 101\\"In the early 1980s, the station dropped its K-100 handle and kept to the calls as \\"KIQQ\\" with a live and local aggressive top-40 or contemporary hit radio (CHR) format. The on-air lineup included Jeff Thomas, G.W. McCoy (engaged to actress Heather Locklear for a time), and Francesca Cappucci. \\"Play Hits for Cash\\" was a regular promotion. KIQQ simulcast the NBC television show Friday Night Videos and even had Wally George as a weekend call-in host. KIQQ also carried American Top 40 beginning in 1983 after competing CHR station KIIS-FM lost the countdown program over the playing of network commercials; this move forced KIIS-FM to create its own chart show, Rick Dees Weekly Top 40.Durkee, Rob. American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century. . New York City: Schirmer Books, 1999. Accessed December 10, 2007. By the mid-1980s, CHR competition from KIIS-FM, KKHR, and KBZT proved too intense for KIQQ; KIIS-FM alone had a 10 share in the Arbitron book. On July 29, 1985, KIQQ flipped to a satellite- delivered adult contemporary format as \\"100.3 K-Lite\\". The format lasted for four years before the launch of another new format. ===KQLZ — Pirate Radio 100.3 FM=== In November 1988, Outlet Communications sold KIQQ to Westwood One for $56 million. The sale closed March 17, 1989 at midnight Pacific Time, and KIQQ officially signed off at 5a.m. after playing its final song, \\"(At) The End (Of A Rainbow)\\" by Earl Grant. KQLZ—branding as Pirate Radio—launched with the Guns N' Roses song \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", adopting the title as its slogan. Pirate Radio broadcast with no commercial interruptions for its first few days, adding one or two advertisements per hour thereafter. Pirate Radio started as a \\"Rock 40\\" station that played hard rock and heavy metal music mixed with upbeat pop music and some alternative rock in a manner similar to mainstream top 40 stations. At first, KQLZ featured an eclectic range of music and proudly proclaimed it played everything from Madonna to Metallica to Milli Vanilli. A typical hour of music on Pirate Radio in the spring of 1989 could include early crossover hip hop artist Tone Lōc, electronic music from Depeche Mode, a pop music ballad by Martika, a pop rock song by The Bangles, and satirical punk rock by the Dead Milkmen, all mixed with music from such rock acts as Iron Maiden, Billy Squier, and Winger. The station was programmed by Scott Shannon, known within the radio business for his work at WHTZ (Z100) in New York City in the 1980s. Shannon left Z100 and moved to Los Angeles to compete against top-rated station KIIS-FM, as well as top 40 crossover outlet KPWR (Power 106). He developed the Pirate Radio concept while launching WHTZ, drawing inspiration from British pirate radio station Radio Caroline. A later account from WMMS program director John Gorman (both WHTZ and WMMS then, and now, are under common ownership) claimed that Shannon wanted to brand WHTZ as Pirate Radio when it launched, but was rebuffed by ownership who wanted WHTZ to be seen as a legitimate radio station; Z100 was his second choice. In addition to Shannon hosting KQLZ's morning drive program, other on-air personalities from the Rock 40 era included Shadow Steele in afternoon drive and Jimmy Page, formerly of KCAQ in Oxnard, in late nights. Westwood One paid Shannon a yearly salary of $2.3 million, then an industry high. The original Pirate Radio billboards featured a close-up head shot of Shannon's face. Some of these billboards were soon defaced with \\"El Diablo\\" in spray paint. Local news media reported that some members of the area's Chicano, Hispanic, and Latino communities viewed Shannon's picture as a caricature of the devil. Some media sources reported that the acts of vandalism were done intentionally by the radio station to generate free publicity. In 1990, the station adopted as its mascot the \\"Party Pig\\", a cartoon pig wearing a trucker hat. This figure replaced Shannon's likeness on billboards and appeared on other promotional items such as T-shirts and bumper stickers. One popular feature during KQLZ’s first few months was \\"Flush and Win\\". The station invited listeners to call in and mention the Los Angeles-area radio station to which they listened before KQLZ signed on. After saying the competing station's moniker or call letters, the sound of a toilet flushing could be heard; this was meant to insinuate that the listener dumped one's former station and switched to Pirate Radio. Along with its local 100.3 FM broadcast in Los Angeles, KQLZ could also be heard via satellite transmission (SatCom 1R, transponder 3, channels 5 and 6). This service was used primarily for the delivery of the syndicated program Pirate Radio U.S.A. to affiliates, but it also gave the station wide exposure outside of the local market. Employees of several radio stations around the country listened to and airchecked KQLZ's satellite signal. In 1989, Westwood One had planned to launch a 24-hour satellite version of Pirate Radio; however, a company representative stated that the debut of such a network was unlikely. After briefly registering successful ratings during its first six months as Pirate Radio, however, KQLZ soon garnered ratings too low to bill advertising rates high enough to sustain operating costs. By late 1989, the station focused more on hard rock and heavy metal music (mostly metal in the more pop oriented glam metal genre), putting it in direct competition with metal station KNAC and album-oriented rock (AOR) outlet KLOS. Shannon and most of the original on-air personalities were dismissed on February 13, 1991; the next day, the station switched to a conventional AOR format, dropping pop and dance music. The following month, Westwood One hired former KLOS program director Carey Curelop for the same position at KQLZ, thus solidifying the switch to AOR. KQLZ dropped the Pirate Radio name on December 28, 1992 and adjusted its format to a hybrid of album rock and modern rock. The station from this point forward was known as simply 100.3 FM with the slogan \\"Southern California's Cutting Edge\\". The Pirate Radio U.S.A. syndicated program, which Shadow Steele had hosted until 1991 and which was thereafter helmed by several others, ceased broadcasting in October 1993. A streaming radio station at the Web site KQLZ.org operated from 2001 to 2015, mimicking the Pirate Radio-era KQLZ, and the call letters were used for several years on a radio station in the Boise, Idaho, market, an affiliate of the satellite-delivered True Oldies Channel, a later Scott Shannon project. On April 1, 1994, as an April Fools' Day radio stunt, Los Angeles modern rock station KROQ-FM switched to KQLZ's \\"Rock 40\\" format, complete with original Pirate Radio bumpers, station legal IDs, airchecks, and playlists. Shadow Steele returned to the airwaves for the event, broadcasting live from the KROQ-FM studio. ===KXEZ — EZ 100.3=== On March 29, 1993, Westwood One announced the sale of KQLZ to Viacom for $40 million, significantly less than what the company had purchased the station for in 1989; this marked the end of its brief stint in radio station ownership. Four days later, on April 2 at 3p.m., 100.3 FM flipped to soft adult contemporary with new call letters KXEZ, and adopted the EZ 100.3 branding. Shannon, on the phone from WPLJ in New York, returned to the station's airwaves briefly to give KQLZ a proper send-off, closing out the old format saying, \\"Goodbye, Pirate Radio\\". It was a return to the dial for the KXEZ call letters and format, which had resided at 98.7 MHz until that station re-branded as KYSR, \\"Star 98.7\\", in 1992. It was during this period that the station hired prostitute Divine Brown to be their television spokesperson soon after her arrest with actor Hugh Grant. ===KIBB — B100=== On August 29, 1996, at noon, KXEZ changed calls to KIBB and flipped to a dance-leaning rhythmic hot AC format, branded as \\"B100\\" (\\"The Rhythm of L.A.\\"). The first song on KIBB was \\"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\\" by The Gap Band.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-09-06.pdf; The move was to go after listeners who had become disenfranchised with the increasing hip-hop content at KPWR. The move also came about based on the instant success of WKTU in New York City, which debuted in February of that year. In 1997, Chancellor Media bought KIBB, added current songs to its playlist, and shifted directions to rhythmic contemporary hits. The slogan changed to \\"L.A.'s Hot FM\\". ===KCMG — Mega 100=== Despite the effort and a promotional campaign (one memorable ad featured a large billboard of a Latina woman dancing placed near a building on Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles), KIBB couldn't make a dent in the ratings. After a little over a year and minor tweaks in its playlist and direction, KIBB's fate was sealed when Chancellor decided to drop the format at 5p.m. on November 19, 1997 (after a couple of days of teasing a \\"major event\\" and playing \\"I'll Be Missing You\\" by Puff Daddy as the final song) for yet another short-lived fad: Rhythmic Oldies as Mega 100. The first song on \\"Mega\\" was \\"The Cisco Kid\\" by War.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-11-21.pdf The call letters were changed to KCMG. The format, which drew instant ratings success in the market, was replicated on many stations across the country in the late 1990s (however, many of these stations would flip in the early 2000s due to poor ratings and promotion). Chancellor merged with Capstar in 1999, forming AMFM Inc. ===KKBT — 100.3 The Beat=== Clear Channel Communications merged with AMFM in 2000. Because of the merger, Clear Channel exceeded the radio station ownership limits (5 FM stations, 3 AM stations) in Los Angeles. As a result, Clear Channel decided to keep the stronger 92.3 FM frequency, as well as KCMG's intellectual property and call letters, and chose to sell the 100.3 FM frequency and the intellectual property of KKBT, which was on 92.3, to Radio One. When the switch was made on June 30, 2000 at 5p.m., 100.3 FM became KKBT, \\"100.3 The Beat\\", and 92.3 became KCMG, \\"Mega 92.3\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-06-30.pdf In August 2001, as the \\"Jammin' Oldies\\" format was starting to fade in popularity, KCMG would morph into an urban adult contemporary direction and the station became KHHT, \\"Hot 92.3\\", a direct competitor to KKBT. Soon afterward, KKBT released their morning team of Dre and Ed Lover, as well as afternoon drivers \\"The Baka Boyz\\". During the first four years under Radio One, KKBT enjoyed modest success as it battled KPWR for the R&B;/hip-hop crown. KKBT heavily promoted Steve Harvey as its high-profile morning star and billed itself under the slogan of \\"Harvey & Hip-Hop\\". However, KKBT never overtook KPWR in the ratings. Harvey was also at odds with station management over the station's hip-hop content and refused to play questionable songs during his show until his departure from the station, when he went to KDAY. By 2004, the station began showing signs of erosion in ratings, as it faced new competition. KDAY, which was formerly on 1580 AM, signed on for the first time on FM at 93.5 and debuted its own hip-hop format that September, siphoning off a good number of KKBT listeners. In addition, KXOL-FM's flip to Reggaeton in 2005 took many of The Beat's Hispanic listeners. KKBT went through a great deal of turmoil, with several popular air staffers leaving or being dismissed from 2002 through 2006. On May 19, 2006, at Midnight, KKBT officially threw in the towel as a mainstream urban outlet and flipped to a hybrid urban adult contemporary/urban talk format dubbed \\"Rhythm & Talk\\". According to the press release that was featured on the station's website: \\"The new format, which will engage 25- to 49-year-old adults, takes the best music of urban adult contemporary stations and adds compelling content delivered by proven national personalities Tom Joyner, Ananda Lewis, Michael Baisden, Wendy Williams and Free.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2006/RR-2006-05-26.pdf Although it retained the \\"Beat\\" branding, the peace sign which was long a staple of The Beat in station logos was discontinued. However, the 'Rhythm and Talk' emphasis did not succeed in the ratings, and the station dropped Free and Lewis first from the lineup. Williams, which aired on tape delay after midnight on weekends, was dropped later, and the Tom Joyner Morning Show was dropped when it could not compete with Steve Harvey on KDAY. Other on-air staffers also left the station, but Baisden remained until the station's format flip in April 2008. Michael Baisden later landed on KDAY, before being dropped by the station in July 2009. KKBT was the last full-market hip hop/R&B; station to use the Urban format as opposed to Rhythmic, not to mention the only one that covered the entire metro. However, much of its target audience tuned to other stations: Hispanics preferred KPWR and KXOL-FM; African-Americans had KHHT, KJLH, and to a lesser extent KTWV as options; and in the meantime, KMVN debuted and targeted older listeners with dance pop from the 1980s to the present day. With that, ratings suffered and speculation grew about its future. Emmis Broadcasting reportedly was interested in the station, but decided not to buy it. Eventually, KKBT elected to go head-to-head with the urban AC formats of KHHT and long-time Compton-based KJLH. The station also hired Cliff Winston away from KJLH for afternoon drive. ===KRBV — V 100.3=== In October 2006, the station began phasing out the \\"Beat\\" branding and promos would only reference the 100.3 frequency and in December 2006, briefly touted \\"Majic\\", giving rise to speculation that Radio One would use the \\"Majic\\" brand, most notably found on sister stations WMMJ in Washington, DC, WWIN-FM in Baltimore, and KMJQ in Houston. However, on December 29, 2006, at 8a.m., Radio One instead unveiled V 100.3. With that, an Urban heritage based era came to an end: the KKBT call- sign was no more after 16 years, and the \\"Beat\\" branding was erased as a piece of radio brand history as KKBT was the very first radio station to carry the \\"Beat\\" moniker (although KDAY briefly revived the branding soon after). With the format flip, the call letters changed to KRBV.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070103005297/en/Radio-Re-Brands- Los-Angeles-Radio-Station (Ironically, KRBV and the moniker \\"V 100.3\\" were both used on an urban AC station, what is now KJKK, in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in the mid- to late 1990s.) The imaging was similar in fashion to WRKS in New York City, perhaps a reason being that Barry Mayo, the former general manager for WRKS, was consulting Radio One and thus wanted to use similar imaging for this station. The re-imaging and air-staff changes did not help the station's ratings, however. At a stockholders' meeting in 2007, some investors called for KRBV to be sold, but company officials said that they had no such plans. One possible reason for this is that KRBV was the only Radio One-owned-and-operated station in the three leading markets in the U.S.; at the time, they did not own stations in New York City or Chicago. Also, a sale of KRBV would come at a loss to Radio One compared to how much it originally paid for it, possibly because of the residual effects of the frequency swap with KCMG. On March 24, 2008, Radio One announced that the station had been sold to Bonneville International for $137.5 million. The transaction closed in the second quarter of 2008. According to a spokesperson for Bonneville, the station would continue to be a music station, although there were rumors that the station would actually flip to news/talk (similar to sister stations KTAR- FM in Phoenix, Arizona, KIRO-FM in Seattle, Washington, and WWWT in Washington, D.C.). On April 3, Bonneville confirmed it would flip the station to adult album alternative. KRBV's air staffers bid farewell to their listeners on their final day, April 7. ===KSWD — 100.3 The Sound=== frameless On April 8, 2008, Bonneville took over the operations of KRBV, and dropped the urban AC format at midnight Pacific Time. The station then began stunting as Bruce Radio 100.3, playing all of Bruce Springsteen's hits in connection with his show that night at the Honda Center in Anaheim). After ten hours of playing \\"the Boss\\", followed by the song \\"I Love L.A.\\" by Randy Newman, KRBV made the following announcement: \\"Hello, and welcome to what we hope will be a new beginning for Southern California and music fans everywhere.\\" The station then became \\"100.3 The Sound\\" and the AAA format officially launched, with \\"Beautiful Day\\" by U2 being the first song played. The new station offered listeners a wide selection of rock music, stretching from the 1960s to \\"last week\\", according to Bonneville vice president of programming Greg Solk and executive VP Drew Horowitz. In an interview from R&R; the day of the launch, Bonneville president and chief executive officer Bruce Reese told the music trade publication, \\"It’s great to be back in L.A.\\" He added that \\"we are truly excited about our new station — 100.3 the Sound will be a music station that has absolute respect for the music and that features a broad playlist\\". On May 14, 2008, new call letters KSWD were officially introduced. The rights to these call letters had to be purchased from an FM station in Seward, Alaska, who then switched to the call sign KKNI-FM. KSWD's new format and \\"The Sound\\" logo were loosely patterned after its then-sister station in Cincinnati, WSWD. But whereas KSWD's direction took a broader approach, WSWD focused mostly on 1990s and current fare (WSWD switched to a different format in 2009). KSWD was the fourth station in the Los Angeles radio market to program a Triple-A format. KNX-FM, KSCA and KACD/KBCD all have featured the format in past years. The last of those stations also used the positioning statement \\"World Class Rock for Southern California.\\" In May 2009, KSWD dropped its new music and shifted to classic rock, although its playlist included many more deep album tracks than their nearest competitors, KLOS and KCBS-FM. As a result, KSWD was pulled off of Mediabase's AAA reporting stations panel. Rival KLOS had already switched back to a harder-edged version of the same format. On July 10, 2009, KSWD held \\"Finally a KMET Friday\\", an on-air event paying tribute to the defunct, pioneering Los Angeles rock station KMET. The event featured on-air appearances by former KMET personalities, classic jingles, and much of the music programming from the era, including an airing of Bob Marley & The Wailers's \\"Live at the Roxy\\" concert. The event was spearheaded by KSWD personality Jeff Gonzer, who was an alumnus of KMET; the station's program director Dave Beasing stated that public response to the event was \\"absolutely overwhelming and proof of the emotional connection that a generation of Southern Californians had with KMET\\". In 2013, KSWD held a second edition of the event, the \\"Mighty Met Weekend\\", from November 1 to November 3, 2013. On December 8, 2014, KSWD general manager Peter Burton and program director Dave Beasing announced that Mark Thompson would replace Joe Benson in morning drive at KSWD.http://laradio.com/December 8, 2014 Benson would move to mid-days and current midday host Andy Chanley would become part of Thompson's show. Thompson hosted his last show on KSWD on August 3, 2016, after which Chanley took his place as morning host. From 1987 to 2012, Thompson co-hosted the morning show on KLOS with Brian Phelps. On July 14, 2015, it was announced that Entercom would swap four of its stations in Denver to Bonneville in exchange for KSWD, to comply with ownership limits related to Entercom's acquisition of Lincoln Financial Media's radio stations. Once the purchase was completed on July 17, Entercom began operating KSWD under a time-brokerage agreement, marking the company's entry into the Los Angeles market for the first time, while Bonneville began operating their new cluster in Denver that same day. The swap to Entercom was consummated on November 24, 2015. On May 21, 2016, LARadio.com announced that the recently rechristened Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League would air live games on KSWD, alongside AM station KSPN. ===KKLQ — Positive, Encouraging 100.3=== A billboard advertising radio station KKLQ, which airs the K-Love network in Los Angeles. Absent from this ad is the \\"K-Love\\" name; this is to prevent confusion with KLVE, which has used the K-Love brand locally since the 1970s. On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced its intent to merge with CBS Radio. The company was required to divest stations in order to comply with ownership limits and on September 26, 2017, the company announced that it would divest KSWD, KSOQ-FM, and WGGI to Educational Media Foundation (EMF) for $57,750,000. KSWD was to be flipped to a contemporary Christian music format as part of EMF's K-Love network. The sale of the three stations to EMF was approved on November 2. Once the station was scheduled to switch to K-Love on November 16, 2017, it was also announced that Los Angeles Rams FM radio broadcasts would move to KCBS-FM, beginning with the team's next game on November 19. As the station's final songs as a rock station, morning co-host Andy Chanley played the side- two medley of The Beatles' Abbey Road, concluding with \\"The End\\". Shortly after a final sign-off by Chanley, KSWD switched to K-Love at 1:00 p.m. The KSWD call letters were moved to KMPS, an Entercom-acquired station in Seattle that flipped to a soft AC format and branded itself as 94.1 The Sound. EMF was required to reach an agreement with Univision Radio (later known as Uforia Audio Network) in order to use the \\"K-Love\\" brand in the Los Angeles market. KLVE, a Univision-owned Spanish language AC outlet, has used the name K-Love continuously since 1974; the company holds the trademark to that brand locally. While terms of this agreement were not disclosed, KKLQ markets itself locally as Positive, Encouraging 100.3, and its station identification contains the slogan \\"The K-Love for Christian music\\", in order to distinguish it from KLVE. In addition, the station markets itself as Positive, Encouraging 100.3 when used in advertising. ==HD Radio== KKLQ broadcasts in HD Radio with both its HD1 and HD2 channels providing Artist Experience data including song titles, artists, and albums on compatible radios. Over the years, 100.3 FM has hosted a variety of formats on its HD sub-channels. The current HD sub-channel formats are: *KKLQ-HD1 — Digital simulcast of the analog signal. *KKLQ-HD2 — Air1, a contemporary worship music network with some contemporary Christian music *KKLQ-HD3 — Radio Nueva Vida, a Spanish-language Christian teaching and music network. The service was introduced to this subchannel in October 2018. Nueva Vida is owned by The Association for Community Education, which has had affiliations and partnerships with EMF in the past. ===Previous sub- channels=== *HD2 **Until the sale to EMF: YTN News FM 100.3, the first-ever South Korean all-news station in the United States. *HD3 **August—September 2018: K-Love Classics, a Christian classic hits network owned by EMF. **Until the sale to EMF: Radio Hamrah, Persian-language programming.

The term may refer to the new aristocracy, or the enriched gentry. It is used by some historians when referring to middle class professionals who held important positions in government, most notably during the reign of Henry VII. In the late Middle Ages social mobility was not generally seen as a good thing, and could be regarded as dangerous to the social order. There had always been social mobility, as the economy expanded continuously, but much of it was in the church, which was more acceptable. In the 15th century the heavy losses from the Wars of the Roses at the top of society, followed in the 16th by much more rapid economic growth and the English Reformation, after which fewer clergy worked in administrative roles, and which liberated in the Dissolution of the Monasteries vast quantities of assets for the agile nobility and gentry to acquire, all worked to greatly increase upwards mobility at the top of society. ==New aristocratsAdministrators== These new men were most usually lawyers, clerics and financial administrators who had come to the notice of the King and had been granted ministerial positions because of their own skills rather than because of a noble background.Gunn, S. 2012 \\"Henry VII's 'New Men'\\" http://www.totalpolitics.com/history/296257/henry-viis-new-men.thtml Accessed 18 August 2012 Common examples of new men are John Morton, Richard Foxe and Reginald Bray. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey could be considered a new man, although by the time of his rise to power new men were not so new and were in fact becoming the norm within government. New men were first used in order to ensure the aristocracy were not allowed to become over-mighty by giving positions to people with little money, land or influence. This was in many respects a success - as it increased efficiency within government by the use of competent ministers and moved away from the previous policy bias towards the nobility. However, many new men used the influence they gained to secure new lands and great wealth and were essentially corrupt. Men like Edmund Dudley and Richard Empson were resented by both the nobles and the general population for the harsh taxes they collected uncompromisingly. This led to their execution on dubious charges of treason.Lee, Cathy. \\"Britain, 1483-1529\\" Nelson Thornes Ltd, 2008, p100 The existence of new men has been disputed by several historians, who feel that middle class professionals have always been a part of government throughout British history. Other historians have claimed that the use of new men, rather than being invented by the British Kings, was borrowed from the French monarchs' tendency to use the middle classes to help govern. However, it is commonly agreed that there was a sudden rise in this type of administrator in government towards the end of the 15th century and this, rather than being a paradigm shift, occurred over a sustained period of time. ==See also== * Novus homo, a similar concept in the Roman Republic ==NotesReferences== *Siegel, Paul N., \\"English Humanism and the New Tudor Aristocracy\\", Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 13, No. 4 (Oct., 1952), pp. 450–468, University of Pennsylvania Press, JSTOR Category:15th century in England Category:16th century in England ","title":"New men"},{"id":"2002029","text":"Magnesium silicide, Mg2Si, is an inorganic compound consisting of magnesium and silicon.

In the face-centered cubic lattice Si centers occupy the corners and face-centered positions of the unit cell and Mg centers occupy eight tetrahedral sites in the interior of the unit cell. The coordination numbers of Si and Mg are eight and four, respectively. ==Synthesis== The reaction of powdered sand with magnesium powder.

Their music is a fusion of alternative rock and heavy metal, as their songs cover a variety of styles, ranging from heavy and upbeat, such as their 2005 single \\"Blamethrower\\" to slower, more melodic songs such as their 2004 single \\"Moving to Blackwater\\". The former style of song often featured vocalist Jamie Lenman switching between shouting and whispering, a technique often used in heavy metal and post-hardcore music. The band performed in the UK underground music scene. Although they attracted a significant fanbase, Reuben never achieved mainstream success, but did chart four songs in the UK Singles Chart. Their highest charting single was 2004's \\"Freddy Kreuger\\", that reached UK No. 53.\\"Reuben – Racecar Is Racecar Backwards | 10 Year Anniversary\\". Hit the Floor, June 23, 2014.

Between 1998 and 2000, Angel recorded and self-released a string of limited edition demos. The songs and artwork of one of these demos, Betrayed, was available to download via the band's website. Many Angel songs were used as b-sides to Reuben singles. ===2000-2003: Line-up change and Pilot EP=== In March 2000, they parted ways with Wilson, and Mark Lawton joined as drummer, with whom they wrote and recorded the Pilot EP, which was released in January 2001 on the Badmusic label after they changed their name to Reuben. The group decided to go ahead with recording the EP after they had won a battle of the bands in Bookham, Surrey, in front of a panel of 12-year-olds. Following the release of Pilot EP, Lawton left and was replaced by their final drummer, Guy Davis. The new line-up toured around the UK,\\"Reuben\\". Designer Magazine and were the subject of a two-hour special on Zane Lowe's XFM Radio Show, despite not yet releasing an album. ===2004: Racecar Is Racecar Backwards=== Their debut album Racecar Is Racecar Backwards was released in June 2004 through Xtra Mile Recordings. Jason Wilson produced the album at Stakeout Studios which at the time was based in Chobham. It spawned the chart singles \\"Freddy Kreuger\\"\\"Classic Of The Week ‘Freddy Krueger’ by Reuben (2004)\\".

The set featured a cover version of the Gorillaz song \\"Feel Good Inc.\\", as well as two songs from the second album, \\"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\\" and then upcoming single \\"Keep It to Yourself\\". In September 2006, the band toured around the UK and Europe with Canadian punk band Billy Talent. This was the first time that Reuben played in Europe.\\"Billy Talent Tour\\". Caught In The Crossfire ===2006-2007: In Nothing We Trust=== On 20 November 2006, the band returned to the studio to record their third album, In Nothing We Trust. It was produced by Sean Genockey with Jack Rushton in Livingstone Studios, London. The album featured three guest vocalists, Frank Turner, Hannah Clark (the singer from the Hampshire-based band, Arthur) and Paul Townsend (formerly of Hundred Reasons). Throughout recording the band uploaded short videos on YouTube for each day in the studio. The album was released on 25 June 2007 via Hideous Records.

The DVD featured both a documentary of life in the band and a full recording of the band's show at London's Mean Fiddler on 27 April 2006 (including an audio commentary). On 13 January 2007, Reuben announced that they would be running their own label, Hideous Records in order to have more control over future releases. The video for the first single from their next album, \\"Blood, Bunny, Larkhall\\" was posted on their website on 7 May 2007. The track was released on 18 June 2007. Their third album, In Nothing We Trust was released to critical acclaim, receiving 9/10 from Rocksound, 4/5 from Kerrang! and Q magazine and 8/10 from Hot Press. The second single from the album, \\"Deadly Lethal Ninja Assassin\\" (featuring Frank Turner of Million Dead fame) was released on 24 September. The band released a new track, \\"Christmas is Awesome\\", for download on 17 December in an attempt to make Christmas No. 1 but, due to an error the wrong song was registered for chart inclusion, and therefore the song was disqualified from chart entry. The third and final song to be released from the album, \\"Cities On Fire\\" was released in March 2008 as a part of the TwoByThree EP. The EP also featured the bands Baddies and The Ghost of a Thousand, both of whom accompanied Reuben on a nationwide tour in support of the EP. ===2008-present: Hiatus=== In June 2008 Reuben stopped recording and performing,\\"Throwback Thursday: Reuben – Racecar is Racecar Backwards\\".

Following the band's split, all three members went off into their own directions. Lenman stopped playing music for over a year to focus on his illustration work. However, after years of receiving letters from fans he was encouraged to get back into music which led to him releasing his debut solo album \\"Muscle Memory\\" in late 2013.. Pearce and Davis however started the band Freeze the Atlantic and would go on to create 3 albums with that band before their eventual split in 2018. On 24 July 2009, the Reuben website was updated to advertise a new rarities collection entitled We Should Have Gone To University. The collection, released in August 2009, contained every non-album track the band released as well as rare demos and session tracks. In addition there was a DVD containing the band's full set at 2007's Download Festival as well as interviews, documentaries and all of the band's music videos. The artwork for the collection was drawn by Lenman, and the collection was issued on Xtra Mile Recordings. In June 2019, Guy Davis joined Lenman for his show at The Palm House in Belfast. He would then join Lenman as one of two of the touring drummer's on Lenman's tour for his third solo album \\"Shuffle.\\" ==Los Skeletos== In 2005, the band members, under the name of Los Skeletos (A reference to the video for the band's single Freddy Kreuger) posted alternative recordings of Reuben songs on their music player.

Brigadier General Russell Lamont Maxwell, United States Army, headed up this military entity. It was abolished by Presidential Executive Order 8900, September 15, 1941, and its functions were transferred to the Economic Defense Board, which had been established by Presidential Executive Order 8839, July 30, 1941, to develop policies and programs to strengthen U.S. international economic relations.Edward S.

In turn, it was abolished by Executive Order 9361, July 15, 1943, and the functions were transferred to the newly created Office of Economic Warfare, OEM, which also assumed control of U.S. Commercial Company, Rubber Development Corporation, Petroleum Reserves Corporation, and Export- Import Bank of Washington from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Consolidated into the Foreign Economic Administration, 1943. ==Henry A. Wallace== Vice President Henry A. Wallace chaired the Economic Defense Board, the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board, and the Board of Economic Warfare as a member of President Roosevelt's secret \\"war cabinet\\". Divided into an Office of Imports, Office of Exports, and Office of War Analysis, the Board of Economic Warfare (BEW) supported the Allied war effort through procurement of strategic resources. As chairman, Wallace freed himself to deal with long-term policy matters by delegating the day-to-day management of the BEW to Milo Perkins, an associate from the Department of Agriculture. Like many special boards created by President Roosevelt, the BEW came in for its share of interdepartmental bickering, rivalries, and conflicts of authority. When Roosevelt signed an executive order in April 1942 allowing the BEW to negotiate contracts with foreign governments, Secretary of State Cordell Hull saw it as an attempt to create a second State Department. Wallace was convinced that the Latin American rubber supply could be increased if living standards of that region's rubber workers were raised to reduce the incidence of chronic malnutrition and malaria. He attempted to force negotiated contracts to provide for improvements to the Latin American infrastructure, with the United States funding half the cost of these programs. Wallace's acquisition of executive authority had been unpopular with the rank and file in Congress, and most members supported Hull, a former senator, in his attacks on the BEW and its chairman. The BEW controversy climaxed in February 1943, when Wallace tried to place the purchasing authority of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) under the BEW's jurisdiction. Commerce Secretary Jesse Jones denounced Wallace's action. When Wallace retaliated by accusing Jones of delaying shipments of quinine to Marines dying of malaria, the imbroglio became too hot for Roosevelt to ignore. The embattled vice president wrote to the president, asking for either complete vindication for his actions in the matter or relief of his duties as chairman of the BEW. Roosevelt responded on July 15, 1943, by dissolving the BEW and reconstituting its function under a new Foreign Economic Administration, headed by Leo Crowley, a known supporter of Jones. ==References== Category:Agencies of the United States government during World War II Category:Defunct agencies of the United States government Category:Economic history of the United States Category:Economic warfare Category:Government agencies established in 1940 Category:1940 establishments in the United States ","title":"Board of Economic Warfare"},{"id":"2002055","text":"A Varignon frame is a system of weights and pulleys used by geographers to help determine optimum location.

Rosemoor and North and South Healand farms were part of Lord Rolle's Stevenstone estate on the east bank of the Torridge. ==Description== The canal comprises a sea lock at Landcross, a 60-foot inclined plane at Weare Giffard and an aqueduct of five arches over the River Torridge at Beam.Industrial Archaeology Aids to recording (6) page 76 At the terminus of the canal at the limekilns at Rosemoor a leat supplies the canal to ensure a constant water level, which channels-off water from the River Torridge at Healand (or Darkham) Weir,http://www.therollecanal.co.uk/index.php/the-canal/lime-kilns/ rebuilt in 1837.http://www.therollecanal.co.uk/wp- content/gallery/1800s/healandbluesml.gif ===Lime kilns=== The canal terminates beyond \\"Rowes Moor\\" (modern: Rosemoor) at a group of lime kilns designed by James Green. These consist of five large pots, each one 14 ft in diameter and 20 ft deep, arranged consecutively in a straight line along a wharf. Railway tracks led from the canal up a ramp to the top of the pots where a flat area existed for the storage of lime and fuel (culm/anthracite) pending burning. An office for the site forman was situated at the upper level. These kilns are derelict in 2013. ==History== The construction of the canal started in 1823 as a private venture financed largely by John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1842), one of whose principal seats was at Stevenstone, east of Great Torrington. He was the largest landowner in Devon and owned much land around Torrington, including the estate of Beam, where continues to exist a mansion house which had served as a home for junior members of the Rolle family. Other shareholders in the company were William Tardrew of Annery, Monkleigh and Richard Pine-Coffin of Portledge,http://www.therollecanal.co.uk/index.php/history/who/ who owned land on which the northerly section of the canal was constructed between the Rolle estate of Beam and the end of the canal at Landcross. The canal was built largely without permission, with an act of Parliament eventually being granted for this purpose in 1835. The idea for the canal had been proposed originally by Lord Rolle's father Denys Rolle but for various reasons nothing had come of those plans. The function of the canal was to import limestone from Wales to be burnt with coal, also imported, at inland kilns to make lime fertiliser which would greatly increase the fertility, and thus the value, of agricultural land. Marland Clay, mined south of Torrington, was to be exported via the seaport of Bideford, at the estuary of the River Torridge, for the making of bricks. More generally the canal was to link the industrial mills at Great Torrington, some of which were owned by Lord Rolle, to the seaport of Bideford on the River Torridge. James Green was employed as the lead engineer.Lost canals of England and Wales Ronald Russell page 79 Lord Rolle laid the foundation stone of the aqueduct in a ceremony which included the firing of a cannon, which unfortunately exploded, causing injury to a man by the name of John Hopgood, whom Rolle compensated with a year's salary. A stone tablet on the north parapet of the Beam Aqueduct is inscribed: > The first stone of this aqueduct was laid by the Right Honourable John Lord > Rolle, Baron Rolle of Stevenstone in the county of Devon, on the 11th day of > August 182(1?) in the presence of the mayor, corporation and feoffees of > Great Torrington and other persons assembled to witness the commencement of > the (word chiselled out) CANAL undertaken at the sole expense of his > Lordship. James Green Engineer. The canal was completed in 1827 at a cost of between £40,000 and £45,000. The canal shared many design features with the Bude Canal, unsurprisingly as the Bude Canal had partly inspired the scheme and shared the same lead engineer. Similarities included the use of trains of tub boats and of canal inclined planes rather than locks. The inclined plane was powered by a water wheel. The canal received its water supply from a weir on the River Torridge which also supplied two mills with power. ==Leased to George Braginton== In about 1852, some ten years after Lord Rolle's death, the canal was leased to George Braginton (1808–1886),Following biographical details of Bragington family from of Moor House, St Giles in the Wood, (the centre of the Rolle's Stevenstone estate) several times Mayor of Great Torrington, described in 1830 as \\"canal agent to Lord Rolle, and Portuguese vice consul for the Devonshire coast, in the Bristol channel\\".London and Provincial New Commercial Directory, London, J. Pigot & Co. (1830) George's father was Richard II Braginton (1784–1869), of Great Silver, in the parish of Great Torrington, employed by Lord Rolle since 1814 and described in Lord Rolle's will proved in 1842 as \\"my steward at Stevenstone\\" was bequeathed £200, with a further £40 to \\"William Braginton one of his sons\\". Richard II thus played the important role of steward of Stevenstone during the time of Mark Rolle's minority from the death of Lord Rolle in 1842 to 1856. Thus it was possibly Richard II who advised the trustees of Mark Rolle to grant the lease to his son. Richard II married Ann Dwerryhouse of Liverpool in 1806. George's grandfather was Richard I Braginton (1752–1812) who had been quartermaster-serjeant of the South Devon Militia, of which Lord Rolle was colonel. He died at Leicester and had been well regarded by Lord Rolle who erected a gravestone to his memory in St Martin's Church, Leicester, inscribed as follows:Transcription from > Beneath are deposited the remains of Richard Braginton Quarter Master > Serjeant of the South Devon Militia who expir'd suddenly in this Town on his > march to NottinghamQuoted from: \\"The Regiment of Militia of which the 7th > South Devon Battalion probably formed a company was in the area due to > serious rioting by workers (Luddites) when more machinery was introduced to > manufacturing industries (i.e. job losses).

George was a merchant and banker, and owned at least one ship, the Margaret, a brigantine of 139 tons built in Bideford in 1835. This was later owned by his younger brother William Dwerryhouse Braginton (died 1888), merchant and substantial shipownerShips owned by William Braginton, quoted from : \\"William Rennie, a barque of 237 tons built in Liverpool in 1850; Louisa Braginton, a barque of 280 tons built in Bideford, Devon in 1856; Annie Braginton, a barque of 413 tons built in South Shields, Durham in 1860; Georgiana, a brigantine of 257 tons built in Bideford that was involved in a collision with the brig Orient in April 1867 at Appledore; Florence Braginton, a barque of 367 tons built in Sunderland, Durham that collided with the barque Superb off the coast of Norfolk in Dec 1864; Clara Louisa, a brig of 214 tons build in Bideford in 1854; and Margaret, a brigantine of 139 tons, build in Bideford in 1835, and originally owned by William's brother George. Available records show that the Annie Braginton sailed to places as varied as New York, Buenos Aires, Penang, Singapore, Bombay and Nelson, New Zealand. She was wrecked off the coast of India in 1884. The Louisa Braginton is known to have made her inaugural ocean voyage between Liverpool and South America. In 1860, her captain was tried in Liverpool for bringing Chilean political prisoners to the United Kingdom, and in September of 1866, she sailed from New York for the United Kingdom but never arrived. William Rennie was lost in the Bay of Biscay in 1856, however, the captain and crew were rescued. The Florence Braginton was sold at auction in 1867, and but lost in 1877 off Cape Horn\\". of Northam, near Bideford, who was declared bankrupt in 1879 and died at Bristol in 1888. George had also become bankrupt in 1865 on the failure of his bank, Braginton, Rimington & Co. He then faced several lawsuits for his \\"rash and hazardous dealings\\", and moved away to Compton Giffard. In 1874 his bankruptcy was discharged. He died in 1886 and was buried in Ford Park Cemetery, Plymouth. George had six children by his wife Margaret Grace Vicary (died 1868), but his only two sons both died as infants, George Vicary Braginton (1840–1842) and Richard George Braginton (1849–1850). George erected a large chest tomb to his infant sons in St Giles's churchyard, and later next to it he buried his parents Richard II Braginton (died 1869) and Ann Dwerryhouse (died 1866), commemorated by a gravestone. Exactly when the lease to George Braginton ended is unknown, but certainly no later than 1865.The Canals of Southwest England Charles Hadfield Page 139-140 On the termination of the lease, control of the canal passed to Lord Rolle's adoptive heir Mark Rolle (1835–1907), a younger son of Lord Clinton and the nephew of his second wife. ==Closure and sale== In 1871 the canal was closed and sold to the London and South Western Railway to form the trackway of the proposed new railway from Bideford to Torrington. At one point the railway company wished to abandon the project but at Mark Rolle's insistence the railway was built. The track followed the canal in several stretches, not sitting within the former canal but on elevated ground beside it. The railway was dismantled during the 20th century and the trackway now forms part of the Tarka Trail cycleway. Some parts of the canal are still visible today, including the Beam Aqueduct, now a viaduct carrying a new entrance drive to Beam Mansion, now an adventure holiday centre. The sea lock also survives, without its gates, as do parts of the inclined plane. The Annery kiln near Weare Giffard lies close to the old canal, between it and the River Torridge, and is visible from the Tarka Trail. The canal has been designated a Devon County Wildlife Site. ==Restoration== The sea lock at low tide while undergoing restoration The Beam section of the canal is still owned by the heir of Lord Rolle, Lord Clinton and is managed by the family's management company, Clinton Devon Estates, still possibly the largest landowner in Devon. Parts of the canal have been under restoration since 1988.North Devon Gazette, 17 August 2006 Clinton Devon Estates plan to restore the Beam estate section of the canal after 2013, and in 2000 completed restoration of the old stone bridge which took the old driveway from Beam Mansion northward over the canal, which passes under through a narrow tunnel.Brass plaque affixed to bridge: \\"Clinton Devon Estates: Beam Canal and Bridge renovated Millennium 2000\\", with Clinton coat of arms above Some work on the sea lock was carried out in 2006 involving re-pointing and rebuilding the eastern wall. ==The canal in fiction== The Beam Aqueduct is referred to as the \\"canal bridge\\" in Henry Williamson's Tarka the Otter.The Country Canal Ronald Russell Page 124 == See also == * Canals of the United Kingdom * History of the British canal system == Further reading  References  External links == * The Rolle Canal & Northern Devon Waterways Society Category:Canals in Devon Category:Industrial archaeological sites in Devon Category:Canals opened in 1827 Category:1827 establishments in England ","title":"Rolle Canal"},{"id":"2002057","text":"White Noise is an English experimental electronic music band formed in London in 1968, after American-born David Vorhaus, a classical bass player with a background in physics and electronic engineering, attended a lecture by Delia Derbyshire, a sound scientist at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson, then both former members of electronic music project Unit Delta Plus, joined Vorhaus to form the band.\\"Unit Delta Plus\\". delia-derbyshire.org. Retrieved 7 May 2017 ==Biography An Electric Storm=== In June 1969 White Noise released the groundbreaking album An Electric Storm on Island Records. The album was created using a variety of tape manipulation techniques, and used the first British synthesizer, the EMS Synthi VCS3. Amongst many oddities, the first track on the album, Love Without Sound, employed sped-up tape edits of Vorhaus playing the double bass to create violin and cello sounds. Although not initially commercially successful for Island, the album is now considered an important and influential album in the development of electronic music, namechecked by contemporary artists like The Orb and Julian Cope, influencing contemporary acts such as Broadcast, Add N to (X), and Secret Chiefs 3. Peter Kember of Spacemen 3 included 'Firebird' on his 2004 curated compilation Spacelines. ===White Noise II-III-IV-V=== Following the departure of Derbyshire and Hodgson, to pursue other projects, Vorhaus released a second album, the largely instrumental White Noise II - Concerto for Synthesizer on Virgin Records in 1974. It was recorded in his own studio in Camden, North London. The album further utilized the EMS VCS 3, as well as prototype sequencers. A third album, the single track 'space fantasy' White Noise III - Re-Entry was released by Pulse Records in 1980. A further two albums were released, the atmospheric White Noise IV - Inferno (AMP Music) (1990) incorporated the use of samples, and White Noise V - Sound Mind (AMP Music; 2000), an experiment in what Vorhaus called \\"dark ambient\\". \\"It means I won't be getting on Top Of The Pops, but I felt the category was broad enough that I could redefine it in ways that I couldn't redefine other genres, such as country and western - much as I'd like to!

He is also the vocalist and guitarist for heavy metal bands Silvertomb and Seventh Void, and sometimes the touring guitarist for Danzig. All three bands also feature fellow Type O Negative member Johnny Kelly on drums. ==Early career== Hickey was born in New York City in 1966. He was asked to join Type O Negative after former Carnivore guitarist Marc Piovanetti declined. Hickey was a childhood friend of the band, growing up in the same neighborhood as the band members. He has been on every Type O Negative release with fellow members Peter Steele and Josh Silver (Johnny Kelly joined in 1994). ==Guitars and amplifiers== In the early days of Type O Negative, Hickey could be seen playing a black Gibson Flying V. He played this for the music video of \\"Christian Woman.\\" He then switched to a black Gibson SG, to which he added green accessories (knobs and pickups and a green painted fretboard), and would continue to follow this trend. Starting in 1996, he used Fernandes Guitars, starting with a Raven Elite Sustainer and Revolver Sustainer with the green additions like his previous SG. He would use this for over half a decade. He would always use the Raven live, but as seen on the music video for \\"I Don't Wanna Be Me,\\" he could be seen using a Monterey Deluxe (without EMGs) in satin black, with a green fingerboard. In 2007, he began using Schecter guitars, most prominently a green C-1 Baritone. Unlike his previous guitars, this has true green inlays, exposed pickups (A Seymour Duncan SH-4 \\"JB\\" bridge, and a Sustainiac neck pickup), and the body, including the headstock, the back of the headstock and the back of the neck is entirely green. All Hickey's guitars have invariably been tuned to B Standard throughout his career. Hickey's early rig (before World Coming Down) consisted of ADA MP-1 & MP-2 preamps or a Marshall JMP-1 with an Alesis Quadraverb running into Marshall 9005 and/or Mosvalve 500 power amps, which were run into one or more Marshall 4x12s w/ G12-75 speakers. During the recording of World Coming Down, Hickey used a Mesa/Boogie dual rectifier, and still uses it, along with a Mesa Boogie Mark IV, as a backup. His main setup consists of a Mesa Boogie TriAxis preamp and TC Electronics G-Force effects processor being sent to a Mesa Boogie Simul-Class 2: Ninety power amp into one or more Mesa Boogie 4x12 cabinets. In the early days he may have used Dean Markley 10–52 gauged strings for B tuning. Today he uses Ernie Ball Not Even Slinky 12–56. While performing with Seventh Void, he could be seen using Mesa/Boogie dual rectifiers and Schecter Solo-6 guitars in either a black finish (seen in the music video for \\"Last Walk In The Light\\"), or Sunburst (seen in the music video for \\"Heaven is Gone\\"). In late 2012, Schecter announced an artist model based on his custom baritone he used near the end of his Type O Negative tenure. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official Type O Negative website *Seventh Void MySpace profile Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:American heavy metal guitarists Category:Danzig (band) members Category:Type O Negative members Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Kingdom of Sorrow members ","title":"Kenny Hickey"},{"id":"2002064","text":"PIJ may refer to: * Palestine–Israel Journal * Pijao language * Proximal interphalangeal joint * Public Insight Journalism * Palestinian Islamic Jihad ","title":"PIJ"},{"id":"2002080","text":"Willy Taveras (born December 25, 1981) is a Dominican former professional baseball player. A center fielder, Taveras has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Colorado Rockies, Cincinnati Reds, and Washington Nationals. ==Professional careerHouston Astros=== Taveras with the Astros in . Taveras played in 10 games at the end of the Astros season, mostly as a pinch runner. In , he led the majors in infield hits (71), bunt hits (31), and singles (152), and was tops among rookies in runs (82), hits (172), and stolen bases (34; 6th in the NL). He hit .291. Taveras was the Astros' starting center fielder during his rookie season (2005), replacing Carlos Beltrán, who signed with the New York Mets in the offseason. In Game 4 of the 2005 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made a catch while running up Tal's Hill in Minute Maid Park's deep center field to end the 8th inning and preserve a 2-1 lead. He scored the winning run as a pinch-runner the inning before on a short sacrifice fly to center field. After the season, Taveras was voted National League Rookie of the Year by the players (Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies won the actual Rookie of the Year Award). In , Taveras' batting average regressed to .278, though he again led the majors in bunt hits (21) and had 33 stolen bases (10th in the NL), but just 30 RBI. Taveras had a 30-game hitting streak that ended August 29, 2006, during a game in which he was hit twice by Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Tomo Ohka. His streak is a franchise record, breaking the record of 25 previously held by Jeff Kent. He is the 42nd player in MLB history with a hit streak of 30-or- more games. Within that streak, Taveras had a streak of singles in 28 consecutive games, tying a National League record set by Willie Davis in 1969. , Taveras and Davis still hold the league record. ===Colorado Rockies=== On December 12, 2006, Taveras was traded along with Taylor Buchholz and Jason Hirsh by the Astros to the Colorado Rockies for Rockies pitchers Jason Jennings and Miguel Asencio.

In a 22-inning game played between April 17–18, , at Petco Park, Taveras set a Rockies' club record with 10 at-bats in the game. He led MLB with 68 stolen bases during the 2008 season, and led the NL with 24 bunt hits. At the same time, his .296 slugging percentage was the lowest in the majors. Defensively, however, he had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league center fielders, .976. On December 12, 2008, the Rockies non-tendered Taveras, making him a free agent.Rockies non-tender Willy Taveras ===Cincinnati Reds=== On December 27, 2008, Taveras signed a two-year deal worth $6.25 million with the Cincinnati Reds.Reds ink Taveras to two-year deal In his debut with the Reds, he hit a pinch-hit triple in the 8th inning after being down with the flu for over a week.

On August 15, 2010, Taveras signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers. ===Return to the Rockies=== On January 25, 2011, Taveras signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. He spent the 2011 season with the Rockies Triple-A affiliate Colorado Springs Sky Sox, batting .308 in 97 games with a .336 on-base percentage. Due to problems with the sports agency that formerly represented him Taveras was out of American baseball for the entire 2012 season. ===Kansas City Royals=== On December 11, 2012, Taveras was signed to a minor league contract by the Kansas City Royals with an invitation to spring training. At the time of the signing Taveras was playing baseball in the Mexican Pacific League with the Yaquis de Obregón. ===Sugar Land Skeeters=== Taveras signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for the 2015 season. This was Taveras first year in Independent Baseball. ===Pericos de Puebla=== On April 11, 2016, Taveras signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball League. ===Acereros de Monclova=== On February 21, 2017, Taveras, along with Chad Gaudin, Daric Barton, Nyjer Morgan, Manny Rodriguez, and Rodolfo Amador, were traded to the Acereros de Monclova in exchange for RHP Joaquín Lara.

His career-high in walks is 36, resulting in a low on- base percentage. In addition, Taveras is an exceptionally poor power hitter, producing the lowest slugging percentage among all regular major league outfielders for both the 2005 and 2006 seasons. He has great speed and has been clocked at 3.57 seconds from home to first as a right-handed hitter. Taveras has also led the league in infield singles, and his BABIP (batting average on balls in play) was .374 in 2007. ==Career highlights== * Player's Choice Rookie of the Year. *2005 Sporting News Rookie of the Year *Named to 2006 Dominican Republic World Baseball Classic team. *30 game hitting streak (Astros franchise record). ==See also== * List of Colorado Rockies team records * List of Major League Baseball annual stolen base leaders * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders ==ReferencesExternal links== : Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Acereros de Monclova players Category:Águilas Cibaeñas players Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Burlington Indians players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Colorado Rockies players Category:Columbus RedStixx players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Gwinnett Braves players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Kinston Indians players Category:Lehigh Valley IronPigs players Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:Mexican League baseball center fielders Category:Mexican League baseball right fielders Category:National League stolen base champions Category:Oklahoma City RedHawks players Category:Omaha Storm Chasers players Category:People from Hermanas Mirabal Province Category:Pericos de Puebla players Category:Round Rock Express players Category:Scottsdale Scorpions players Category:Sugar Land Skeeters players Category:Washington Nationals players Category:Yaquis de Obregón players Category:World Baseball Classic players of the Dominican Republic Category:2006 World Baseball Classic players Category:2009 World Baseball Classic players ","title":"Willy Taveras"},{"id":"2002084","text":"PacWest Center is a 30-story, office skyscraper in Portland, Oregon.

Four crisis scenarios were considered and finally, with the state of emergency decreed by the Spanish government and the confinement, the toughest scenario had to be applied, the fourth, with the complete closure of the campus, which required an urgent transformation and an immediate response. To this end, they had the digital resources and previous experience with the WebEx platform, in addition to the Zoom platform to cover all the courses of the MBA, the Master in Management (MiM) and the Doctoral Program (PhD). The digital transformation process involved continuous interaction with the participants of the different programmes, an open mind, teamwork and the strictness and flexibility to move forward and consolidate phases. By 15 March, 370 digital sessions and 1,150 hours of classes had been arranged, with the participation of 32,700 people. Among the resources created to face the COVID-19 crisis, a digital space of open content online was provided with reports, conferences, interviews and monographs on macroeconomics and politics, business strategies, leadership and people for the world after, that will require a great transformation towards economic and social recovery. All sessions are broadcast openly through IESE's Linkedin profile and through IESE's YouTube channel. In these sessions, professors analyze the several practical aspects of the crisis, people management, public health systems administration or operations management. ==International Rankings== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" ! !2014 !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !2019 !2020 |- |FT - Global MBA |7th |7th |16th |10th |11th |12th | - |- |FT - MBA for Women | - | - | - | - |14th | - | - |- |The Economist - Global MBA |5th |14th |8th |17th | - |10th | - |- |FT - Executive Education - Open |6th |3rd |2nd |2nd |2ndLaurene Ortmans (May 13, 2018) \\"FT Executive Education Ranking 2018\\" |6th |1st |- |FT - Executive Education - Customized |3rd |1st |1st |1st |1st |1sthttp://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/executive-education- customised-2019 |1sthttps://www.ft.com/content/36c1e468-8f2b-11ea-9e12-0d4655dbd44f |} For the sixth consecutive year, the Financial Times considers IESE to be the world leader in executive education.

","title":"African Footballer of the Year"},{"id":"2002091","text":"Bertram Hays Jones (born September 7, 1951) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Baltimore Colts and the Los Angeles Rams. At Ruston High School in Ruston, Louisiana, he was given the nickname, \\"The Ruston Rifle.\\" Jones played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU). He is the son of former NFL running back Dub Jones of the Cleveland Browns. He was named the NFL Most Valuable Player in 1976 with the Colts. In 2016, Jones was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. ==College== Jones attended LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he played for the LSU Tigers football team. While at LSU, Jones only started two games prior to the end of his junior year, but he started every game thereafter, leading LSU to a 12–2–1 record. In 1971, Jones threw for 945 yards with nine touchdowns and four interceptions while splitting time with Paul Lyons. Against the wishes of LSU fans, Jones was forced to share quarterback duties with Lyons because of Jones' bickering with head coach Charlie McClendon over signal calling.Chet Hilburn, The Mystique of Tiger Stadium: 25 Greatest Games: The Ascension of LSU Football (Bloomington, Indiana: WestBow Press, 2012), p. 44. Lyons himself threw for over 800 yards and 11 touchdowns that year. In 1972 after taking over at quarterback, Jones threw for 1,446 yards with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions on 199 pass attempts. Except for one week, LSU spent the entire season ranked in the AP Top 10. One of Jones' most famous moments came in the 1972 LSU vs. Ole Miss game, when he led LSU to a 17–16 last-second victory by hitting running back Brad Davis in the end zone for a touchdown as time expired. To this day, many believe that a clock malfunction on the previous play gave four seconds for Jones to complete the game-winning touchdown pass for LSU. After the season, Jones became the first quarterback in LSU history to be awarded consensus All-America honors. Jones also finished fourth in the vote for the Heisman Trophy and was named the national collegiate Player of the Year by The Sporting News. Retrieved March 27, 2009. During his 17 games at LSU, Jones completed 52.6 percent of his passes for 3,225 yards and 28 touchdowns, which at the time was the most career passing yards and touchdowns of any quarterback in school history. In 2016, Jones was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. ==Professional career== Jones was projected by NFL scouts to be the first quarterback drafted in 1973. He was chosen second overall by the Baltimore Colts to be the Colts' heir apparent to Johnny Unitas, who was later traded to San Diego. His debut came on September 16, 1973 in a loss to the Cleveland Browns. During his eight-year tenure as the Colts' starting quarterback, Jones and his teammates enjoyed three consecutive AFC East division titles (1975–77). But in each of those years, the Colts lost in the first round of the playoffs. The 1977 playoff game (known as Ghost to the Post) is famous as the fourth longest game in NFL history; the Colts fell to the Oakland Raiders, 37–31. Jones missed most of 1978 and 1979 with a shoulder injury, and the Colts fell to last place in the AFC East those two seasons. The 1976 regular season was Jones' finest as a professional; he threw for 3,104 yards and a career-high 24 touchdowns, compiling a passer rating of 102.5. He was one of only three quarterbacks to achieve a 100+ passer rating during the entire decade of the 1970s, joining Dallas' Roger Staubach (1971) and Oakland's Ken Stabler (1976). Jones was honored by the Associated Press as 1976's NFL Most Valuable Player and NFL Offensive Player of the Year, selected first-team All- Pro, and named to the Pro Bowl team. He was also selected second-team All-Pro following the 1977 season. The remainder of Jones' playing career beyond 1977 was curtailed by several injuries, the first of which was a separated shoulder after a hit from Al Baker in a Colts' 13-7 win over the Detroit Lions at the Pontiac Silverdome on August 26, 1978 in the final preseason contest for both teams.Grotz, Bob. \\"Preseason NFL games can do more harm than good,\\" Delaware County Daily Times (Swarthmore, PA ), Wednesday, August 7, 2019. Retrieved October 19, 2020 During an October 26, 1980 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Jones made NFL history when he was sacked a record 12 times. This broke the record at the time held by many quarterbacks, including Jones' then back-up, Greg Landry, who had been sacked 11 times while he was a member of the Detroit Lions in a game against the Dallas Cowboys on October 6, 1975.NFL Record and Fact Book In 1982, his final season, Jones played in four games for the Los Angeles Rams before a neck injury forced him to retire. In 1990, Jones participated in the first NFL Quarterback Challenge. He finished first in the retiree category and third in the regular competition (The regular competition taking the top three finishers from the alumni competition and adding them to the regular field of current quarterbacks). Given his strong performance, Bobby Beathard, then the general manager of the Chargers, wanted Jones to come out of retirement, but Jones was 38 at the time and chose not to try a comeback. The widely respected scout Ernie Accorsi is quoted as saying that if Bert Jones had played under different circumstances, he probably would have been the greatest player ever. John Riggins has been quoted as saying Jones was the toughest competitor he has ever witnessed. On the eve of Super Bowl XLII, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, in discussing his choices for the greatest quarterbacks of all time, described Jones as the best \\"pure passer\\" he had ever seen. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Ruston, Louisiana Category:Sportspeople from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:Players of American football from Louisiana Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Ruston High School alumni Category:LSU Tigers football players Category:All-American college football players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Baltimore Colts players Category:Los Angeles Rams players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American television sports announcers ","title":"Bert Jones"},{"id":"2002106","text":"KXOL-FM (96.3 MHz \\"Mega 96.3\\") is a commercial FM radio station in Los Angeles. It is owned by the Spanish Broadcasting System and airs a Spanish CHR radio format. KXOL-FM's studios and offices are on West Pico Boulevard.Mega963FM.com/Contact The transmitter is located in the Verdugo Mountains, near Burbank, California.Radio-Locator.com/KXOL-FM KXOL-FM is also heard on a 14-watt booster station in Santa Clarita, KXOL-FM-1 at 96.3 MHz.Radio-Locator.com/KXOL-FM1 ==HistoryEarly years=== The station first signed on as KRKD-FM, owned by Radio Broadcasters, Incorporated.Broadcasting Yearbook 1951 page 88 It was the FM sister station to AM 1150 KRKD (now KEIB). Continental Telecasting Corporation bought the station in 1955, followed by Trans American Broadcasting Corporation in 1959. Two years later, Trans American sold the station to the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel as part of the consolidation of KRKD and its time share partner, KFSG, which both took turns broadcasting on 1150 kHz. Both the AM and FM stations aired a Christian radio format. ===Four Square Gospel Church=== In the late 1960s, KRKD AM and FM were partially simulcast, but KRKD-FM broke occasionally for theatrical performances and opera. In 1970, Foursquare sold off the AM station and moved the KFSG call sign (meaning \\"FourSquare Gospel\\") to the FM station on June 8 of that year. KFSG aired Southern Gospel music along with religious programming produced by the church along with syndicated staples like \\"Focus on the Family,\\" \\"Joni and Friends,\\" \\"Insight for Living\\" and \\"In Touch Ministries.\\" The station's schedule was about 50% music and 50% teaching programs. For years, the station played traditional Christian music with Christian contemporary music heard for only a few hours a week on Saturday. But by 1981, KFSG began to mix in softer contemporary Christian songs into the format. By 1987 KFSG was a Christian adult contemporary station playing such artists as Twila Paris, Steven Curtis Chapman, Amy Grant, David Meece, Randy Stonehill, PFR and White Heart. ===Sale to SBS=== After fifty years of owning KFSG, the Foursquare Church sold the station in 2003 to the Spanish Broadcasting System.Broadcasting Yearbook 2005 page D-82 It was a $250 million sale. On April 30, 2001, KFSG moved its programming and call sign to FM 93.5 in Redondo Beach (now KDAY), but dropped the music and went with all-religious talk programming full-time. SBS owned the station at 93.5 and leased it to Foursquare as part of its purchase of the more powerful 96.3 frequency. (93.5 operated at 6,000 watts while 96.3 ran 54,000 watts.) In 2003, the 93.5 lease ended and SBS regained control of the station, ending Foursquare's run in Southern California radio. On May 9, 2001, SBS flipped 96.3 a Spanish AC format, changing the call letters to KXOL. The station became El Sol 96.3 (\\"The Sun 96.3\\") with Sylvia Villagran as the first woman to host a morning radio show in Los Angeles. According to Arbitron between 2001 and 2004, the show garnered high ratings, consistently placing it among the top three morning shows in Los Angeles. '\\"El Sol\\" was one of two Spanish AC radio stations in Los Angeles until May 2005, when its format change left KLVE as the only station in L.A. airing a softer adult Latin format. ===Lawsuit with Emmis Communications=== In 2005, SBS decided to drop KXOL's Spanish adult contemporary format for hurban (Spanish urban contemporary). The abrupt switch violated a transmitter lease agreement that SBS, had with Emmis Communications, the owner of KXOL's transmitter site. The agreement required formal notification to Emmis of any change in KXOL's format and expressly prohibited the station from programming to directly compete with Emmis' English-language Rhythmic outlet KPWR. SBS switched formats anyway, and Emmis filed a lawsuit to force SBS to either drop the format or find a new transmitter. SBS announced that KXOL would move to another transmitter site a month later, and both parties settled the dispute. === Latino 96.3 and LA 96.3 === KXOL had success as a Latin Urban outlet, partly due to KXOL snatching some of (the now-defunct) KKBT and KPWR's Hispanic listeners. Around 2010, it had begun to tilt its direction towards Latin Hip-Hop as \\"Latino 96.3,\\" but still remain within the urban arena. By May 2012, KXOL dropped the \\"Latino 96.3\\" moniker and replaced it with the newer but shortened \\"LA 96.3.\\" KXOL began using the slogan \\"L.A.'s Party Station.\\" The playlist has also shifted further towards a conventional Rhythmic direction except for a handful of urban tracks. By late 2012, the station rebranded back to \\"Latino 96.3\\" with a blend of Spanish and English rhythmic hits. === Mega 96.3 === On May 16, 2014, at 2 p.m., KXOL changed formats to Spanish AC as Mega 96.3 to compete with KLVE K-Love 107.5. KXOL Flips to Mega 96.3 By November 2014, KXOL switched to a Spanish CHR format, still calling itself \\"Mega 96.3\\" while returning to the slogan \\"LA's Party Station.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *KXOL-FM official website * XOL-FM Category:Latin rhythmic radio stations XOL-FM Category:Spanish Broadcasting System radio stations Category:Hispanic and Latino American culture in Los Angeles Category:Radio stations established in 1949 Category:1949 establishments in California ","title":"KXOL-FM"},{"id":"2002108","text":"NK Iskra, commonly known as Iskra Bugojno or just Iskra (meaning \\"spark\\" in Bosnian) is a professional association football club from the town of Bugojno that is situated in central Bosnia and Herzegovina.

He played collegiately at Auburn University along with future NFL backs William Andrews and James Brooks. He began his professional career in 1980 with the Buffalo Bills. After being drafted in the second round of the 1980 NFL Draft, Cribbs went on to start all 16 games of his rookie year with Buffalo, finishing with 1185 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. His performance earned him consensus UPI AFC Rookie of the Year honors and a spot in the Pro Bowl, the only rookie chosen as a starter that year. In five seasons with the team, split around a detour with the USFL, Cribbs had 13 100-yard games and ran for 1,000 yards in a season three times. In the spring of 1984, Cribbs left the Bills in a contract dispute and signed on as a member of the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League (USFL). Cribbs was to serve as the president of Team Alabama of the AAFL, which suspended operations shortly before it was slated to play its first games. Almost immediately, Cribbs was named commissioner of the United National Gridiron League, which likewise failed ever to play a game.UNFL Wants Team in Alabama ==College career== Joe Cribbs played college football at Auburn. He played his first college football game in 1976, and when the season was over, he had 171 yards on 43 rushing attempts. He got more playing time in 1977, with 872 yards on 161 rushing attempts. He scored four touchdowns as a rusher. He also caught six passes for 51 yards. 1978 was the breakout year. Cribbs rushed for 1,205 yards in 253 attempts, scoring 16 touchdowns, and averaging well over hundred yards a game. He was a threat out of the backfield as well, catching right passes. He was also used on gadget plays as well. Cribbs passed the ball four times, completing three passes for 74 yards. In 1979, Cribbs final season at Auburn, Cribbs had 200 rushing attempts for 1,120 yards, and scored 14 touchdowns rushinghttp://www.totalfootballstats.com/PlayerQB.asp?id=861 ==Lawsuit against the Buffalo Bills== Cribbs (middle) rushes the ball for the Bills against the Jets in the 1981 AFC Wild Card game. Cribbs was an immediate success playing for the NFL team which drafted him, the Buffalo Bills, and was named the American Football Conference Rookie of the Year for the 1980 season and as a starter in the Pro Bowl. He also played very well in each of the two subsequent seasons and was named to the Pro Bowl again following each. When the NFL played an abbreviated 9 game schedule due to the strike-shortened season in 1982, Cribbs was only able to play in 7 games but nonetheless led the league with 90.4 rushing yards per game. Cribbs was not exactly happy in Buffalo, however, as he especially disliked playing in their infamous cold- weather home games. With one year left on his contract with the Bills, Cribbs signed a contract with the Birmingham Stallions of the USFL. In the summer of 1983, Cribbs officially inked a contract with Birmingham worth $3.5 million. However, the Bills challenged the contract, citing that they had first right of refusal. This clause had been in Cribbs' original contract with the Buffalo Bills. This was placed in the contract in order to protect Buffalo in case there was no collective bargaining agreement and to prevent another NFL team from signing Cribbs in that event. However, obviously there was no mention of a prohibition of any team from the USFL signing Cribbs, as that league was yet to be formed when Cribbs signed his contract with the Bills. The trial was held in Buffalo, and one of the people testifying for the Bills was head coach Kay Stephenson, who stated that Joe Cribbs was irreplaceable in the Bills lineup. Federal Judge John T. Elfvin heard the case. While the trial was going on, Cribbs continued to work out with the Stallions. When the verdict came down, Judge Elfvin ruled in favor of Cribbs, allowing him to play for the Birmingham Stallions.Kickoff magazine Violume 4 ==USFL and contract dispute in Birmingham== Herschel Walker made the jump from college football to the USFL, becoming the league's highest paid player at $6 million over four years. This played a factor in Joe Cribbs walking out of his contract with the Birmingham Stallions. Cribbs had signed a deal in 1983 worth $2.6 million dollars to play for Birmingham, and still five years left on the contract. At the time of his walkout, Cribbs was leading the USFL in rushing.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/05/09/Birmingham-Stallions-running- back-Joe-Cribbs-who-was-obtained/2152452923200/ ==Later career== Cribbs was a fairly major star with the Stallions; however, the USFL folded after its 1985 season and Cribbs then returned to play in the NFL. Cribbs played for the San Francisco 49ers in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. He then divided the 1988 season between the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins prior to his retirement. During this return stint in the NFL, Cribbs never came truly close to the level of consistency which had put him into three consecutive Pro Bowls early in the decade. ==References== *About.com. \\"AFL/AFC Rookie of the Year\\".

Walter Klien on concert tour 1977. Dedicated to Southern Africa tour organiser Hans Adler ==Career== Klien was born in Graz in 1928. His mother was the artist Erika Giovanna Klien (1900-1957). She emigrated to the United States in 1929, and their only further contact was by correspondence. Klien studied piano with Josef Dichler at the Music Academy in Vienna and with Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. He also studied composition with Paul Hindemith. He was a laureate of the Busoni Competition in Bolzano and the Marguerite Long Competition in Paris and made his debut in the United States in 1969. In 1953 he had been awarded the Bosendorfer Prize in Vienna. Shortly before his death from cancer in 1991 (which occurred shortly before a planned visit to Australia), he was honoured with the Joseph Marx Music Prize in 1987 and the gold medal of the city of Vienna in 1989. ==Recordings== His discography is large, and much of it has been reissued on CD or is available in download format. It includes the complete solo piano works and many of the piano concertos of Mozart, much of the piano music of Brahms, as well as the complete piano sonatas of Schubert. He partnered Arthur Grumiaux in recording the Mozart music for piano and violin, and Rena Kyriakou in the complete piano music of Chabrier. He performed and recorded piano duo and duet repertoire with his wife, Beatriz Klien and with his Graz contemporary Alfred Brendel. He was much admired for his crystalline tone and projection of detail in his interpretations. His clarity of playing suited the music of Mozart and Schubert in particular. These qualities are also very evident in his Brahms recordings, where the dense textures of the writing can easily obscure the musical argument. Critics continue to regard his complete Schubert sonatas as amongst the finest recorded, not least for their unique Viennese lilt and unaffected ease. === External links=== * KATALOG DER DEUTSCHEN NATIONALBIBLIOTHEK Category:1928 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Austrian classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:Classical piano duos Category:Long-Thibaud-Crespin Competition prize-winners Category:20th- century classical pianists Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Walter Klien"},{"id":"2002127","text":"Hell With the Lid Off, released in 1990 (see 1990 in music), is the first album by MC 900 Ft.

Its titles were mainly action/adventure, western, and horror. Its most notable character was Johnny Dynamite, created by Pete Morisi. The main artist across its titles was Don Heck, who in 1955 would be recruited by Stan Lee to Atlas Comics; what would become Marvel Comics. Don went on to be one of the architects of what became known as \\"The Marvel Age of Comics,\\" along with the legendary Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Dick Ayers. While there Don co-created Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. When Comic Media became defunct, the company sold its titles and characters to Charlton Comics. Charlton then continued Dynamite as Johnny Dynamite, with work by Morisi, who continued to work for the company for many years. Johnny Dynamite would later be purchased by Max Allan Collins and Terry Beatty and reprinted in their Ms. Tree title and a miniseries they created. ==Notable titles== * 3D Funny Movies (1 issue, 1953) (humor) * All True Romance (20 issues, 1951–54) (romance) — acquired by Farrell Publications * Confessions of Love (2 issues, 1950) (romance) * Danger (11 issues, 1953–53) (espionage) * Dear Lonely Heart (8 issues, 1951–52) (romance) * Dear Lonely Hearts (8 issues, 1953–54) (romance) * Death Valley (6 issues, 1953–54) (western) * Dynamite (9 issues, 1953–54) (action, Johnny Dynamite in issue #3 on) * Honeymoon Romance (2 issues, 1950) (romance) * Horrific (13 issues, 1952–54) (horror) * Noodnick (5 issues, 1953–54) (romance) * Terrific (1 issues, 1951–52) (horror) (numbering continues from Horrific (Comic Media, 1952 series) #13 * War Fury (4 issues, 1952–53) (War) * Weird Terror (13 issues, 1952–54) (horror) == External links == * * Category:Comic book publishing companies of the United States Category:Defunct comics and manga publishing companies Category:1952 establishments in the United States Category:Publishing companies established in 1952 ","title":"Comic Media"},{"id":"2002133","text":"Psyence Fiction is the debut studio album by British-American electronic music group Unkle, released on 24 August 1998 by Mo' Wax. The creation of the album was helmed by the duo of James Lavelle and DJ Shadow, with the former overseeing the album's themes and the latter handling musical composition. Psyence Fiction also features contributions from a varied cast of guest musicians recruited by Lavelle. Psyence Fiction reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 107 on the US Billboard 200. ==Composition== \\"Unreal\\" is an instrumental version of the song \\"Be There\\" (featuring Ian Brown), which was released a year later as a single. On some early pressings of the album, instrumental versions of \\"Guns Blazing\\" and \\"The Knock\\" were added as tracks 13 and 14. On some re-releases of the album, \\"Be There\\" was added as track 13. Some versions (mainly the Japanese release, but also the US promotional copy) contain the hidden track \\"Intro (optional)\\" as \\"track zero\\", which is actually the pre-gap (index 0) of track 1. This can be accessed by \\"rewinding\\" the first track on some CD players. ==Critical reception== Psyence Fiction was widely anticipated due to its high-profile cast of collaborators, with Shadow's involvement in particular leading to expectations that the album \\"would be a sort of Endtroducing..... Part II\\". It was ultimately released to mixed reviews, with many critics finding that the album failed to live up to pre-release hype. John Mulvey of NME wrote that Shadow's music \\"rarely gels with Lavelle's chosen singers or even comes to terms with the song (as opposed to groove) format of much of the material\\". Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan said that the album successfully sustains its \\"foreboding\\" mood, but added that \\"its strength is also its weakness: somewhere amid the sprawl of bad dreams it turns into nothing more than meandering tunes with spooky keyboards attached\\". The A.V. Clubs Joshua Klein criticised Unkle's decision to eschew hip hop in favour of a \\"more conventional alt-rock outline\\", concluding that \\"Psyence Fiction can be chalked up as an ambitious failure; its principals can put it on their résumés, but cultural historians needn't put in their books.\\" Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention, deeming it \\"Not beautiful (or weird) enough for its own beats\\". Among positive reviews, Barry Walters of Spin wrote that DJ Shadow \\"frames suitably eloquent voices with chaotic but never overwhelming aural bricolage\\", calling Psyence Fiction \\"the illest soundclash since the last time a B-boy crashed a George Romero film festival and refused to turn off his boom-box\\". Writing in Rolling Stone, Lorraine Ali found the album to be \\"neither a lofty concept album nor the sonic equivalent of cinema\\", but concluded that \\"it is Shadow and Lavelle's striving for such greatness that makes UNKLE a compelling work in progress\\". Entertainment Weeklys David Browne wrote that despite the presence of filler, \\"the best bits... are like a soundtrack for a surreal, melancholy art film that exists in Shadow's and Lavelle's heads.\\" Gareth Grundy of Select wrote that Shadow's production provides the album with coherence, and that when he and Lavelle \\"click... it hums with joie de vivre – the sound of a vision thrillingly realised\\". Disillusioned with the project, DJ Shadow departed Unkle following Psyence Fictions release and distanced himself from the album. Years later, James Lavelle opined that the album's hype ended up overshadowing its musical content, adding that he felt it was released at a time \\"when people wanted [him] to fail\\". Shadow would later soften his stance on Psyence Fiction, remarking in a 2010 interview that he viewed the album fondly despite it being \\"somehow flawed\\". ==Kickstarter campaign== In June 2013, Unkle launched a Kickstarter campaign titled \\"URBAN ARCHAEOLOGY: 21 YEARS OF MO'WAX,\\" part of which included a deluxe re-release compact disc of Psyence Fiction. The campaign raised over $51,000. As of Fall 2020, the Psyence Fiction album has not been released to the Kickstarter campaign contributors. ==Legacy== In the years following the release of Psyence Fiction, the album's reputation has steadily improved. In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that Psyence Fiction, despite its musical flaws, \\"gains momentum on repeated listens\\" due to \\"Shadow's imagination and unpredictable highlights\\", which make for \\"a superstar project that doesn't play it safe and actually has its share of rich, rewarding music.\\" Writing in The Vinyl Factory, Elliot Wilder expressed similar sentiments and noted that the album had \\"gained cult status for its chaotic collages and maverick collaborations\\", adding that it \\"feels today like the kind of crazy, alt-star-strewn mash fest that it is\\". Chris DeVille of Stereogum wrote that Psyence Fiction presaged \\"likeminded ecumenical collectives like Gorillaz and Handsome Boy Modeling School\\", and that \\"In terms of quality alone, it's worthy of remembering as one of the best albums of its era.\\" In 2015, Fact named it the 45th best trip hop album of all time. ==Track listing== ;Sample credits *\\"Bloodstain\\" contains samples of \\"Alone\\", performed by BeBe K'Roche. *\\"Unreal\\" contains samples of \\"Birth\\", written by Jules Blattner and performed by The Jules Blattner Group, and \\"Pre-Dawn Retrospective Chant\\", written and performed by Steve Forman. *\\"Celestial Annihilation\\" is based on the composition \\"Concerto for Strings and Beats\\" by Wil Malone. *\\"Getting Ahead in the Lucrative Field of Artist Management\\" is an advert for the 1975 boardgame \\"Ball Buster\\", from Mego Corporation, though the name of the company at the end of the track has been reversed. ==Personnel== Credits for Psyence Fiction adapted from album liner notes.

He was also a composer and a lecturer at music academies. In composition and playing, he focused on chamber music and lieder. He played with singers such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, as a piano duo with Paul Badura-Skoda, and with string players such as Josef Suk and Antonio Janigro. Demus was instrumental in bringing the historic fortepiano to concert podiums. He was a member of the Legion of Honour, among many awards. He is regarded as one of the leading Austrian pianists of the immediate post-World War II era.88 notes pour piano solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Neva Editions, 2015, p. 52. ==Early life and education== Demus was born in St. Pölten; his father was the art historian Otto Demus, and his mother was a concert violinist. At the age of six, Demus received his first piano lessons. Five years later, at the age of 11, he entered the Vienna Academy of Music, studying piano, composition and conducting. He made his debut as a pianist when he was still a student: at the age of 15, he played in the Brahms-Saal of the prestigious Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Bach's Das wohltemperierte Klavier. He graduated in 1945, then 17 years old, after which he continued to study conducting with Josef Krips and Hans Swarowsky. Demus studied in Paris with Yves Nat from 1951 to 1953. In 1953 he further studied interpretation with Wilhelm Kempff, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, and Edwin Fischer, and attended master classes with Walter Gieseking. == Pianist == In 1951, Demus made his first tour to South America and then appeared internationally in concert halls. He appeared in England and France. In 1972 he toured Southern Africa in all the major cities. In 1974, Demus performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston. Demus was active as a lied accompanist and a chamber music partner, appearing with singers such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Elly Ameling and Peter Schreier, and with string players such as Josef Suk and Antonio Janigro. He performed widely as a soloist on both modern and historical instruments, returning the fortepiano to concert podiums. Demus collaborated with Paul Badura-Skoda on the concert platform and on a book concerning the interpretation of Beethoven's piano sonatas.Les sonates pour piano de Ludwig van Beethoven / Paul Badura-Skoda et Jörg Demus. Trad. de l'allemand par Jean Malignon German National Library His playing of Bach's works showed their structure as well as melodic lines. He favoured Schumann's music, revealing a high degree of playful levity besides romantic expressiveness. His playing of Debussy's music stands out in Klangsinn, a sense for a colourful impressionist sound world. He collected historic keyboard instruments and presented them to a museum. He lectured at the music academies of Vienna and Stuttgart. Demus continued playing until shortly before his death, performing with Badura-Skoda at the 2018 Linz Brucknerfest. He died in Vienna on 16 April 2019, aged 90, after a short illness. == Composer == Demus was also a composer, chiefly of music for the piano, chamber music and lied, composing in a generally conservative style. Music for cello and piano takes its inspiration from the poems of Paul Verlaine and the late music by Schumann. ==Awards and prizes== In 1956 Demus won first prize at the Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition. Demus received the Mozart Medal of the Mozartgemeinde Wien in 1979. He was awarded the Österreichisches Ehrenkreuz in 2006, the Beethoven Ring of the Beethoven Society Vienna in 1977, the Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau and the Order of the Legion of Honour. == Recordings == Among the many recordings by Demus are sets of the complete piano works by both Robert Schumann and Claude Debussy. He also recorded Schubert's Impromptus on the Deutsche Grammophon label. He made recordings on historical keyboard instruments, including, for example, the earliest such recording of Beethoven's \\"Waldstein\\" sonata in 1970, on a Broadwood dating from 1802. He recorded several of his own compositions with cellist Maria Kliegel, including Poetische Sonate (Poetic Sonata) in G minor, Op. 8, Liebe (Love), Op. 21, after Verlaine's Crimen Amoris, the Cello Sonata in C minor, \\"Il Tramonto\\", Op. 35, and Nacht der Sterne (Starry Night), Op. 14. ==References External links == * * * Jörg Demus, Konzertagentur Jahn * Early recordings for Don Gabor's Remington Records Category:1928 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Austrian classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:Classical accompanists Category:Austrian fortepianists Category:Austrian classical composers Category:Austrian male classical composers Category:People from Sankt Pölten ","title":"Jörg Demus"},{"id":"2002159","text":"The Italian Chapel, interiorExterior of the chapel Font of the Italian Chapel The Italian Chapel is a highly ornate Catholic chapel on Lamb Holm in the Orkney Islands. It was built during World War II by Italian prisoners of war, who were housed on the previously uninhabited island while they constructed the Churchill Barriers to the east of Scapa Flow. Only the concrete foundations of the other buildings of the prisoner-of-war camp survive. The chapel was not completed until after the end of the war, and was restored in the 1960s and again in the 1990s. It is a popular tourist attraction, and a category A listed building. It is in the Roman Catholic Parish of Our Lady & St Joseph in Orkney, part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen. Mass is held in the chapel on the first Sunday of the summer months (April–September). == Construction == 550 Italian prisoners of war, captured in North Africa during World War II, were brought to Orkney in 1942. They worked on the construction of the Churchill Barriers, four causeways created to block access to Scapa Flow. 200 were based at Camp 60 on Lamb Holm. In 1943, Major Thomas Pyres Buckland, Camp 60's new commandant, and Father Gioacchino Giacobazzi, the camp's Catholic priest, agreed that a place of worship was required. The chapel was constructed from limited materials by the prisoners in the form of a tin tabernacle, and comprises two Nissen huts joined end-to-end. The corrugated interior was then covered with plasterboard and the altar and altar rail were constructed from concrete left over from work on the barriers. Most of the interior decoration was done by Domenico Chiocchetti, a prisoner from Moena. He painted the sanctuary end of the chapel and fellow-prisoners decorated the entire interior. They created a facade out of concrete, concealing the shape of the hut and making the building look like a church. The light holders were made out of corned beef tins. The baptismal font was made from the inside of a car exhaust covered in a layer of concrete. When his fellow prisoners were released shortly before the end of the war, Chiocchetti remained on the island to finish decorating the newly consecrated chapel.Orkney's Italian Chapel. P.O.W. Chapel Preservation Committee, Stromness undated, p.5 == Preservation == In 1958, the Chapel Preservation Committee was set up by a group of Orcadians. In 1960, Chiocchetti returned to assist in the restoration. He returned again in 1964, with Mrs Maria Chiocchetti, but he was too ill to travel when some of the other prisoners returned in 1992 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of their arrival on the island. He died in 1999. In 1996, a declaration was jointly signed by officials in Orkney and Chiocchetti's hometown of Moena, reinforcing the ties between the two places. Today, the chapel is still used as a place of worship and remains a popular tourist attraction, receiving over 100,000 visitors every year. It has become one of the best-known symbols of reconciliation in the British Isles. Philip Paris wrote two books, one fiction and one non- fiction, about the building of the chapel. The novel The Chapel at the Edge of the World by Kirsten Mckenzie covers the chapel's building. In 2014, a special Mass was held at the chapel to mark its 70th anniversary. During the Mass, Angela Chiocchetti, the daughter of Domenico Chiocchetti, sang Panis angelicus. In 2015, professional art restorer Antonella Papa offered and had her services accepted to restore the chapel's frescoes, spending a month on the work. She continued this work with the help of local volunteers at the end of October 2017. ==Architectural details== Image:Italian Chapel Ironwork - Lamb Holm - Orkney - kingsley - 29-JUN-09.JPG|Interior metalwork detail Image:Italian War Memorial, Lamb Holm - geograph.org.uk - 955201.jpg|War memorial, including a statue of Saint George, outside the chapel File:OrkneyItalianChapel.JPG|Detail of murals == See also == * Pietermaritzburg Italian P.O.W.

That September, Western Hotels changed the location name to the Vancouver Airport Inn, and assumed the management until January 1964. During 1965–1967, Delta Developments built four motels on Vancouver Island, and leased/purchased two further motels in the BC interior. Driver Developments, which bought Delta Developments in 1969, evidenced serious financial difficulties from its diverse investment portfolio within months. In 1970, Delta Hotels Limited assumed the ownership and operation of the hotels/motels. By mid 1974, the chain had been pruned to four properties. ===Beyond BC=== Delta London Armouries Hotel, Ontario, 2005. In 1975, Delta entered the Toronto market. By 1980, the six BC properties matched the six out of province. By 1985, there were four in BC, four in Ontario, and five across four other provinces. The owners, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Great- West Lifeco, and Bill Pattison, sold the chain to the Realstar Group of Toronto in 1988. A decade later, Realstar, and partner Lai Sun Group, resold to Canadian Pacific Hotels (CP Hotels). During the 1990s, Delta operated a single US hotel, the Delta Court of Flags Hotel in Orlando, Florida. In 1999, after CP Hotels acquired the Fairmont brand, six CP properties rebranded to supplement the existing 24 Delta ones, and the Delta chain became a wholly owned subsidiary of CP Hotel's two-thirds-owned Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. In terms of classification, Fairmont was four star and Delta three star. After British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) acquired Delta in 2007, the brand flourished, and by 2013 the portfolio comprised 40 properties, of which 31 were managed (10 having the real estate owned), and nine were franchised. Delta Privileges ranked as one of the best hotel rewards programs offered in Canada. ===Canadian Portfolio=== Since 2015, each venue prefix has become Delta Hotels by Marriott. {| class=\\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\\" |- !class=\\"unsortable\\"| Name !!

He is known for his opposition to higher taxes and public spending, although he supports taxing women's hygiene products (such as tampons and sanitary pads) and has been nicknamed \\"Dr. No,\\" as in \\"no taxes for men and no rights for women.\\" In 2014, Brinkman defeated incumbent Peter Stautberg in the Republican primary election to retake his former seat in the Ohio House of Representatives. He went on to win the general election with 67.78% of the vote. ==Background== A resident of the Mount Lookout section of Cincinnati, Brinkman graduated from St. Xavier High School and received a B.A. (in history and political science) from George Washington University in 1979. In 1976, he worked for the Ronald Reagan campaign to win the Republican nomination for President, and for the Gerald Ford campaign following Ford's nomination at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City. While a student at GWU, he worked in the office of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas from 1977 to 1979. In 1980 he supported Congressman John B. Anderson's presidential bid, but switched his support to Reagan following the Republican National Convention. From his graduation to 1999, he was Midwest Sales Manager for the Metroweb printing company in Erlanger, Kentucky. From 2001, he has worked in the sales department of the Curry Printing Company of Evendale, Ohio. He and his wife, Cathy, have six children: Will, Stephen, Daniel, Kelley, Kevin, and Michael. ==Local politics== Brinkman worked for several Republicans' successful campaigns for Cincinnati City Council: Phil Heimlich, Steve Chabot, Charles Winburn, and Pat DeWine. He also worked for John Kruse's unsuccessful bid. In 1999, he founded the Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST), which actively opposes tax levies in southwestern Ohio. Brinkman actively worked against many tax levies and bond issues. In his Congressional campaign he declared: ==To the General Assembly== Brinkman defeated the candidate endorsed by the Republican party in the GOP primary in 2000 for the 37th District seat in the Ohio House, which was Anderson Township, the Hyde Park and Mount Lookout sections of Cincinnati, and the city of Norwood . A Brinkman supporter was upset by the party's endorsement process: \\"All we wanted was a free, open process of endorsement, and we didn't get that,\\" said Christopher Finney . In the primary, Steve Adams, the endorsed candidate, received 9,344 votes and Brinkman 11,127. In the November general election, he faced Democrat Les Mann, a security guard at General Electric's aircraft engine plant in Evendale who previously had run for Congress against Rob Portman, and Natural Law candidate Jim Donaldson. The vote was 35,245 for Brinkman (66.7%), 2,029 for Donaldson (3.8%), and 15,531 for Mann (29.4%). Brinkman ran for reelection in 2002 to what redistricting had made the 34th District, which included the Mount Washington, Hyde Park, and Mount Lookout sections of Cincinnati, part of Columbia Township, all of Anderson Township, and the municipalities of Fairfax, Newtown and Terrace Park . He faced no opposition in the May 7 primary and was opposed in the November 5 general election by Democrat David Schaff, a twenty-four-year-old assistant to Hamilton County commissioner Todd Portune. Schaff said his opponent was \\"someone who's spent more time saying what he's against than working for what he's for.\\" Schaff was endorsed by The Cincinnati Post, which wrote > Tom Brinkman's opposition to almost everything undercuts his credibility, > and does a disservice to both the district and the region. His reflexive > opposition to much government spending, his willingness to tolerate a > tattered social services safety net, his advocacy of an entirely unregulated > concealed carry gun permit system, we submit, are out of step even with such > a thoroughly Republican constituency. That year Brinkman called on Republican voters to cast their ballots for Democrat Tim Hagan over Republican Governor Bob Taft in his reelection bid because of Taft's selection of Jennette Bradley as his running mate; many conservatives felt she was too liberal for the party. The Cincinnati Enquirer's Peter Bronson labeled Brinkman \\"Kamikaze Tom\\" for this action, but nevertheless, Brinkman was easily reelected over Schaff by a vote of 23,748 to 13,896. ==His stands in Columbus== When University of Cincinnati law students in 2003 persuaded the General Assembly to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which a post-Civil War-era legislature had rejected, only one member voted against ratification: Brinkman. Brinkman told The Enquirer his vote was because of how the amendment has been misused: > It's misapplied constantly by the country to get states to do things they > don't want to do. Most importantly to me, 45 million babies have been > murdered since judges forced Roe v. Wade down the throats of citizens. Following the repeal of Article XII of the Cincinnati city charter, which forbade the city from passing an ordinance protecting homosexuals from discrimination, the Cincinnati city council approved a hate crime ordinance that included sexual orientation. Brinkman said the ordinance \\"send[s] the message that you openly approve of homosexuality,\\" citing the Catechism of the Catholic Church . Brinkman had previously served as treasurer of the committee which opposed repeal of Article XII . Brinkman prided himself on his perfect attendance and for coming home to Cincinnati every night from Columbus, but when Columbus Monthly in late 2003 did a survey of legislators, lobbyists, and others working in the State House asking them to rate the members of the Ohio General Assembly, Brinkman was rated the single worst legislator in the 132-member General Assembly. The magazine said Brinkman was \\"an uncompromisingly principled man. But he's a terrible, terrible legislator.\\" Those surveyed ranked him as least knowledgeable, least hardworking, least likeable, least compassionate, and least savvy. Brinkman, for his part, points to his principled stance on the issues as the reason lobbyists don't like him. In 2007, Representative Brinkman was named the chairman of the House Commerce and Labor Committee. ==2004 reelection== In 2004, he faced a challenger in the primary, attorney Greg Delev of Anderson Township. Brinkman told the Enquirer, \\"I ran for office when the party wanted to dictate who my state representative was going to be. I couldn't stand for that, so I ran, and I'm proud I did. It's been a frustrating three years as I've watched Governor Taft drive the state off a cliff. But I've been fighting back.\\" Delev said he agreed with Brinkman on most of the issues, but that Brinkman's actions in Columbus had made the district \\"the laughingstock of the state.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer said both candidates were \\"rock-ribbed conservatives who agree on most fiscal and social issues,\\" but endorsed Delev. \\"The issue here is Brinkman's lack of effectiveness,\\" said the newspaper, echoing the Columbus Monthly article: > Few lawmakers are as honest, principled and consistent as Brinkman. But he > exhibits those qualities to a fault, coming off as stubborn, ideologically > rigid and unwilling to compromise. He's made many enemies in Columbus by > refusing to see anyone else's side of things. This has limited his ability > to work with others and get things done. Brinkman won the March 2 primary: > 7,113 (63.00%) to 4,178 (37.00%). In the general election on November 2 he > faced Democrat Glenn Miller of Anderson Township, a former history teacher > who worked in job training. \\"I think the biggest issue of this race is Tom > Brinkman--how he votes and how he's against everything,\\" Miller said. The > Enquirer, again citing his stubbornness, endorsed Miller . Despite the > criticism, Brinkman once again won the Republican district by a comfortable > margin: 35,229 (60.04%) for Brinkman to 23,451 (39.96%) for Miller. Brinkman > strongly supported concealed carry legislation. \\"We have a constitutional > right to bear arms. Larry Flynt has a right to put out smut and some people > may not like that, but it's a right whether we like it or not,\\" he said . > Brinkman sponsored legislation to allow ex-cons the right to cut hair. He > called \\"stupid\\" the policy of the state regulators to deny prisoners who had > taken prison-administered barber classes a license upon their release. \\"I'm > for personal responsibility, but people do make mistakes and we should give > them a second chance,\\" Brinkman said . Brinkman also worked to limit state > spending just as he had opposed local projects. In 2003, he opposed Taft's > \\"Third Frontier\\" project and the bond issue on the November ballot as Issue > One which would have permitted the state to borrow money to subsidize > business's research and development. \\"Who would have thought a Republican > governor would run on this?\\" Brinkman said (Issue One was soundly defeated > by voters).

Brinkman in 2004 criticized state spending for Cincinnati's bid > to win the 2012 Olympic Games and against legislation in 2004 to give > hospitals more money for breast cancer examinations .

Previously, he had > opposed Governor Taft's proposed personal income tax cut because it would > mean higher local property taxes. He also called for funding for public > libraries to be maintained. On April 28, 2005, he introduced a bill, House > Bill 228, that would ban all abortions. Brinkman acknowledged that the bill > was unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade, but wanted to use it as a test case > to overturn the Roe decision. \\"We’re just positioning the state for the > future,\\" he told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. He re-introduced the ban on > July 2007, despite the additional burden of Gov. Strickland's veto threat. > Six months before, he passed legislation for Ohio to conduct a study of how > the death penalty has been administered in the state. \\"I'd like to abolish > it or have a moratorium, but you've got to start somewhere.\\" ==Congressional > bid== Second District, which includes seven counties in southern Ohio. > Brinkman ran for Congress in 2005 to replace Portman, announcing his > candidacy outside the post office in Anderson Township on April 14 . > Brinkman told the press \\"When I first went to Columbus, I promised my > constituents that I would fight for lower taxes, limited government, and to > end abortion. I will do the same in Washington.\\" An early poll found Pat > DeWine, a member of the Hamilton County Commission and the son of U.S. Sen. > Mike DeWine, with a significant lead: 42 percent for DeWine, 6 percent for > Brinkman. Brinkman had a strong anti-abortion stance that was criticized by > rival candidate Pat DeWine because he also opposed the death penalty - > despite such opposition being seemingly more anti-abortion, as it is in > accordance with the Consistent Life Ethic. One mailing from DeWine had a > large, ominous photograph of a man in a ski mask pointing a gun directly at > the viewer. The caption was \\"Tom Brinkman opposes the death penalty, even > for child murderers, cop killers and terrorists who kill Americans.\\" The > mailing also stated \\"Tom Brinkman says he's a conservative but when it comes > to the safety of our families, he doesn't stand with us\\" and that murderers > \\"will get off easy if he casts the deciding vote.\\" DeWine did not note that > Brinkman's opposition to the death penalty was rooted in his pro-life > beliefs. Automated calls were made by DeWine's campaign featuring Joe > Deters, Hamilton County prosecutor. Deters in the recording stated: > >> In my career when I prosecute the worst of the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only appropriate punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress. > > One of Brinkman's mailings said \\"Tom Brinkman believes all life is precious > and must be protected.

Brinkman also complained about DeWine > taking advantage of his father's name in raising money, but publicly > distancing himself from his father's positions, such as Senator DeWine's > role in the \\"Gang of 14\\" judicial filibuster compromise in May 2005 with six > other mostly center-leaning Republicans and seven mostly center-leaning > Democrats. \\"He seems to have no problems riding his father's coattails when > it comes to raising money and getting name recognition; he's willing to take > all the good from it and none of the bad.\\" In one mailing to voters Brinkman > did not mince words: > >> I am sick and tired of watching politicians promise to _cut taxes_ in October--then raise them in March.

Pieces by François Couperin and Jean-Philippe Rameau appeared regularly on her programmes, as well as that of Mozart and Haydn. The music of Schumann was the significant exception to her neglect of romanticism, though she also included Chopin's studies in her repertoire. However, it was as a performer of twentieth-century French music that Haas is best remembered. Her recordings of Debussy include the comparatively neglected Douze Études, which won a Grand Prix du Disque, and the Préludes. She also recorded both of the Ravel concertos, the G major twice, as well as his complete solo piano music. She was a noted interpreter of Bartók's music, and performed his third piano concerto only a few days after its world premiere by György Sándor. Another non-French composer whose works appealed to her was Hindemith; she made a valuable recording of his Suite for Piano and Strings The Four Temperaments. She also recorded his Konzertmusik For Piano, Brass & Harp with Hindemith himself conducting. ==Style== French piano players of Haas's generation were moving away from the facile and often brittle technique associated with Marguerite Long (frequently referred to as the \\"diggy-diggy-dee\\" style).Fourestier. See, for example, Jean-Philippe Collard in Gramophone Magazine 1997 Haas combined the cleanness and precision associated with the older school with a warmth of tone colour that reflected the influence of Alfred Cortot. Her unsentimental readings, especially of Debussy and Ravel, give a different view of their music, presenting them as both modern and as inheritors of the tradition of Couperin and the clavecinistes of the 18th century. Contrasts can be found between her two recordings of the Ravel Concerto in G. The earlier one, made in 1948, makes much of the work's connections with the jazz idiom of the 1920s. The later recording, made in 1965, is far more \\"Mozartean\\", reflecting Ravel's self-confessed debt to Mozart when he wrote the concerto.Jean-Charles Hoffelé. A child of the century.

First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007. Schools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup (effectively division 4), Section A Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup (effectively division 3), Section B Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1). Attendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on Saint Patrick's Day at Lansdowne Road (now known as the Aviva Stadium). In 2008, the final was played at the Royal Dublin Society Grounds (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS and live television coverage , the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000–14,000. The competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters for putting undue pressure on its schoolboy participants, and for being \\"elitist\\" (most of the competing schools are fee-paying; as of 2020 the most recent tournament victory by a non fee-paying school was De La Salle Churchtown's 1985 win). It is also the subject of satire through the Ross O'Carroll Kelly newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has also been praised with \\"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\\".Irish game in debt to schools rugby Blackrock College are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having won 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined. Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician ==History== Three schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; Blackrock College in the competition's maiden year in 1887, Castleknock College who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. St. Fintan's High School are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season. To date, only five schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \\"double\\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935–36, 1942–43, 1945, 1948, 1953–54, 1956–57, 1962, 1964, 1981–82, 1986–87, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013–14, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920). Even more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), Newbridge College (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and Blackrock College (2017) with 1 each. This happened to Blackrock College for the first time in 2017. Blackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College. The 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary's College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick's Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on 19 March. Grainy video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley. In September 1967, the then Minister for Education Donogh O'Malley introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \\"Free Education\\" scheme. To date, only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985, De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College. Four captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College,Leinster Schools Senior Rugby Cup Centenary Celebration 1886-19861962 and 1963), Jonny Mion (Blackrock College) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996. The Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for Ireland. Players such as Denis Hickie, who captained his St. Mary's College team to win the cup in 1994, and Gordon D'Arcy have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from Blackrock College, with players such as Hugo MacNeill, Brendan Mullin, Brian O'Driscoll, Victor Costello, Shane Byrne, Bob Casey, Leo Cullen and more recently Luke Fitzgerald, Ian Madigan, Jordi Murphy, Garry Ringrose and Joey Carbery. Terenure College has also produced many Irish international players including Mick Hipwell (also Lion's 1971), Kevin Flynn, Paul Haycock, Niall Hogan (Irish Captain 1995), Conor O'Shea (former head coach Italian national team), Ciaran Clarke, and Girvan Dempsey. De La Salle Churchtown produced the following Internationals - Des Fitzgerald (34 caps) played in 2 RWCs. Named to Lions Team to mark centenary of IRB Tom Clancy (9 caps), Brian Glennon (1 cap), Niyi Adeolokun (1 cap), Lar Hudson (7 caps) and Austin Quirke (6 caps for France). The 2020 season has not been completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Roll of honour== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- ! style=\\"width:25%; background:silver;\\"| School ! style=\\"width:30%; background:silver;\\"| Location ! style=\\"width:5%; background:silver;\\"| Titles ! style=\\"width:40%; background:silver;\\"| Winning years |- |23x23px Blackrock College |Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown | 69 |1887–88, 1890, 1893–97, 1900–05, 1907–1910, 1912, 1915–1919, 1925, 1927–1930, 1933–1936, 1939, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1956, 1957, 1960, 1962,1964, 1967, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018 SCT & JCT Double 27 times – 1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018 |- |23x23px Belvedere College | Great Denmark Street , Dublin City | 12 |1923–24, 1938, 1946, 1951, 1968, 1971–72, 2005 (Double), 2008, 2016–17 |- |23x23px Terenure College |Terenure, Dublin City | 10 |1952, 1958 (Double), 1979–80, 1984, 1992–93, 1997, 2001, 2003 |- |23x23px Castleknock College | Castleknock, Dublin | 8 |1913, 1920 (Double), 1931, 1937, 1944, 1947, 1959, 1965 |- |23x23px Clongowes Wood College | Clane, County Kildare | 8 |1926, 1978, 1988, 1991, 1998, 2000, 2010–11, |- |23x23px St. Mary's College |Rathmines, Dublin City | 5 |1961, 1966, 1969, 1994, 2002 |- |23x23px St. Andrew's College | Booterstown, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown | 4 | 1906, 1911, 1921–22 |- |23x23px Newbridge College | Newbridge, County Kildare | 2 |1941, 1970, |- |23x23px St. Michael's College |Ailesbury Road, Dublin 4 | 3 |2007, 2012 (Double), 2019 (Double) |- |23x23px De La Salle Churchtown | Churchtown, Dublin | 2 |1983, 1985 |- |23x23px Corrig School¹ |Monkstown, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown | 2 |1889, 1892 |- |23x23px Cistercian College, Roscrea |Roscrea, County Offaly | 1 |2015 |- |23x23px C.B.C.

In September 2013, Beauchamps Solicitors became the new title sponsor for the Leinster Schools Senior Cup. For the duration of this partnership with Beauchamps, the Senior Cup will be known as the \\"Beauchamps Leinster Schools Senior Cup\\".http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/domestic/10954.php#.Us166rR0mPx The competition receives extensive coverage in Ireland's broadsheets, in particular the Irish Independent and The Irish Times. Both publish previews of each year's competition and provide match reports for each game played. In years gone by the competition's final on St Patrick's Day would sometimes be broadcast on TG4, however, this was discontinued in the early 2000s. From 2005 onwards, however, Setanta Sports began extensive coverage of school's rugby. This included the finals of all provincial finals and coverage of the Leinster Schools Junior Cup. The Leinster Senior Cup was most prominent, however, with coverage from every game played at Donnybrook and every round of the competition. FreeSports replaced Eir Sport as the competition broadcaster ahead of the 2019 competition where they will broadcast eight games live. ==Leinster School of the Year Award== In 2008, Leinster Rugby instituted a new award for overall performance of a school at every level of schools rugby. The award, Powerade Leinster Rugby School of the Year is given at the annual Leinster awards ceremony. The inaugural winners were C.B.C. Monkstown. They were followed in by Terenure College (2009), St Gerard's School (2010), Clongowes Wood College (2011), St. Michael's College (2012), (2019) and Blackrock College (2013), (2018).

Currently, Bosna plays in the Second League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Group Center) and plays its home matches on Stadion Luke which has a capacity of 5,200 seats. The club's greatest success was in the late 1990s. Guided by manager Ivo Ištuk, Bosna won the Bosnian Cup, Bosnian Supercup and made great results in the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, even almost winning it in the 1997–98 season. ==HistoryFoundation=== NK Bosna was founded in 1953 in the city of Visoko with the merging of local sides NK Jadran (1923) and NK Radnički (1934) into a single club. After spending a decade in the third-tier, the club got promoted to the Yugoslav Second League in 1963, which was the club's biggest achievement in the former Yugoslavia. Bosna again got promoted to the second league in 1978 after winning the Bosnia and Herzegovina Republic League. The club stayed in the league for three years, before being relegated in the 1980–81 season. ===Success and downfall=== In the 1995–96 (north) Second League of Bosnia and Herzegovina season, Bosna finished on 1st place and got promoted to the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club had its biggest success in the late 1990s under the guidance of current manager Ivo Ištuk. In the 1997–98 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina season, the club finished the first round on 1st place, but did not win the whole league as it succumbed in the group stage play-offs. The next season, Bosna had great success, as it won the 1998–99 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup, the first trophy in the club's history and the next season, won the Bosnian Supercup in 1999. After years of playing in the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the 1999–00 league season, Bosna got relegated to the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 2000–01 season, alongside HNK Grude, Bosna got promoted back to the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After two seasons of Premier League football, in the 2002–03 season, Bosna finished on last place and got relegated once again to the First League of FBiH. ===Present=== Stadium Luke during a match between Bosna and Velež Mostar. Since getting relegated from the top tier of Bosnian football again in May 2003, Bosna mostly played in the First League of FBiH, with three seasons of them also playing in the Second League of FBiH (center) (2011–12, 2013–14 and 2014–15) and the fourth (2019–20) season to be played. For a short period, from January to May 2013, 17 years after leaving Bosna, Ivo Ištuk, the club's most successful manager in history came back to the club and managed the club in that period. On 5 August 2014, Bosna and FK Sarajevo signed a cooperation agreement by which Sarajevo will loan its talented youngsters to the Visoko-based side and will have first-buy rights on all NK Bosna players. By signing this agreement, Bosna de facto became Sarajevo's farm team. The agreement was signed by Adis Hajlovac and Mirza Laletović on behalf of Bosna, and Abdulah Ibraković on behalf of Sarajevo. In the 2016–17 First League of FBiH season, Bosna throughout the whole season held 1st place and were really close to coming back to the Bosnian Premier League, but at the end of the season they failed to finish 1st as bad results costed them the promotion. At the end they finished 2nd, six points off champions NK GOŠK Gabela and only two points more than 3rd place FK Tuzla City, at that time still known as FK Sloga Simin Han. On 5 April 2017, almost four years after leaving the club, Ivo Ištuk once again came back to Bosna and became the new manager. In July 2019, he left the club after over two years as its manager. In the 2018–19 First League of FBiH season, Bosna for a third time in the club's history got relegated to the Second League of FBiH (center). ==Club seasons== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\" |- !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Season !colspan=\\"9\\"|League !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Cup !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Europe |- !Division !width=\\"20\\"|P !width=\\"20\\"|W !width=\\"20\\"|D !width=\\"20\\"|L !width=\\"20\\"|F !width=\\"20\\"|A !width=\\"20\\"|Pts !Pos |- !rowspan=2|1994–95 |First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina Jablanica Group||5||2||2||1||6||4||8||2nd||||rowspan=2| |- |First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina Final Play-off||3||1||0||2||2||3||3||bgcolor=#cc9966|3rd |- !1996–97 |First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina||30||16||6||8||60||29||54||bgcolor=#cc9966|3rd|||| |- !rowspan=2|1997–98 |First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosniaks First League||30||19||3||8||55||28||60||1st||rowspan=2|QF||rowspan=2| |- |First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina Play-off||2||1||0||1||3||3||3||4th |- !1998–99 |First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina||30||18||2||10||50||21||56||bgcolor=silver|2nd||bgcolor=gold|Winners|| |- !1999–2000 |First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina||30||10||6||14||34||36||36||bgcolor=#FFCCCC|12th ↓||bgcolor=silver|2RU|| |- !colspan=\\"15\\"|Current format of Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina |- !2000–01 |First League of FBiH||32||21||5||6||69||24||68||bgcolor=#D0F0C0|2nd ↑||R32|| |- !2001–02 |Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina||30||11||6||13||33||48||39||12th||QF|| |- !2002–03 |Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina||38||4||1||33||28||107||13||bgcolor=#FFCCCC|20th ↓||R32|| |- !2003–04 |First League of FBiH||30||11||6||13||37||47||39||11th|||| |- !2004–05 |First League of FBiH||30||11||4||15||27||38||37||13th|||| |- !2005–06 |First League of FBiH||30||14||4||12||39||38||46||9th|||| |- !2006–07 |First League of FBiH||30||13||2||15||35||42||41||10th||R32|| |- !2007–08 |First League of FBiH||30||13||4||13||41||39||43||10th|||| |- !2008–09 |First League of FBiH||30||15||4||11||47||26||49||3rd|||| |- !2009–10 |First League of FBiH||30||13||2||13||47||41||41||6th|||| |- !2010–11 |First League of FBiH||30||12||5||13||39||44||41||bgcolor=#FFCCCC|13th ↓|||| |- !2012–13 |First League of FBiH||28||9||6||13||28||37||33||bgcolor=#FFCCCC|13th ↓|||| |- !2015–16 |First League of FBiH||30||15||2||13||47||36||47||4th|||| |- !2016–17 |First League of FBiH||30||15||5||10||39||29||50||2nd|||| |- !2017–18 |First League of FBiH||30||10||7||13||42||49||37||10th||R32|| |- !2018–19 |First League of FBiH||30||3||3||24||16||68||12||bgcolor=#FFCCCC|16th ↓||R32|| |- !2019–20 |Second League of FBiH – Center||15||7||4||4||25||16||25||5th|||| |} ==HonoursDomestic==League==== *First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina: **Winners (1): 1997–98 (First Round) *First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: **Winners (1): 1995–96 **Runners-up (1): 2016–17 *Second League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: **Winners (2): 2011–12 , 2014–15 *Bosnia and Herzegovina Republic League: **Winners (1): 1977–78 ====Cups==== *Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup: **Winners (1): 1998–99 ** Runners-up (1): 1999–2000 *Supercup of Bosnia and Herzegovina: **Winners (1): 1999 ==Club officialsCoaching staff=== {| |valign=\\"top\\"| {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !Name !Role |- | Faruk Dedić |Head coach |- | Mirsad Džafić |Goalkeeping coach |- |} ===Other information=Notable players== * Ibrahim Sirčo * Slaviša Vukičević * Faruk Ihtijarević * Almedin Hota * Elvir Rahimić * Mirsad Bešlija * Esmir Džafić * Adnan Džafić * Kenan Hasagić ==Notable managers== * Ivo Ištuk * Nermin Bukva * Faruk Dedić ==See also== *Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina *FK Sarajevo ==ReferencesExternal links== *NK Bosna Visoko at Facebook Category:Association football clubs established in 1953 Bosna Visoko Category:Sport in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosna Visoko Category:1953 establishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina ","title":"NK Bosna Visoko"},{"id":"2002219","text":"The Democratic Party of Republika Srpska (, Demokratska Stranka Republike Srpske) was a Serbian political party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ==History== The party was established in 2009 by Dragan Čavić, who left the Serbian Democratic Party.

He was the eldest son of Samuel Parkes (died 1 April 1811, aged 76), a grocer, by his first wife, Hannah, daughter of William Mence of Stourbridge. He was at a dame's school in Stourbridge with Sarah Kemble, and in 1771 went to a boarding-school at Market Harborough, Leicestershire, under Stephen Addington. Parkes began his career in his father's business. In 1790 he was one of the founders, and for some years president, of a public library at Stourbridge. Around 1793 he moved to Stoke- on-Trent, Staffordshire. A Unitarian, he conducted public worship in his own house at Stoke. In 1803 he settled in Goswell Street, London, as a manufacturing chemist. He joined Sir Thomas Bernard in agitating (1817) against salt duties, which were repealed in 1825. In 1820 he was prominent, as a chemical expert, in a notable case between Messrs. Severn, King, & Co. and some insurance offices. He was a numismatist, and made a collection of Greek and Roman coins; he was a collector also of prints and autographs, and brought together a set of the works of Joseph Priestley. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823. Parkes was a member of 21 learned societies, British and foreign. During a visit to Edinburgh, in June 1825, he went down a painful disorder, which proved fatal. He died at his residence in Mecklenburgh Square, London, on 23 December 1825, and was buried in the graveyard of the New Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney. His funeral sermon was preached by William Johnson Fox. His portrait, from a drawing by Abraham Wivell, and engraved by Ambrose William Warren, was prefixed to the twelfth and thirteenth editions of the Chemical Catechism. ==Works== The first editions of Parkes's manuals of chemistry were issued between 1806 and 1815, and brought him a reputation, and honours from learned societies.Parkes's manual on chemistry and Henry's manual on chemistry are mentioned by Charles Darwin as books that he studied before attending Cambridge. The Chemical Catechism was written for the education of his daughter, and lent in manuscript to others. After it was translated into Russian, the Emperor of Russia sent him a valuable ring. In 1817 the Highland Society voted him a silver inkstand for an essay on kelp and barilla. He received a silver cup from the Horticultural Society of Scotland for a paper on the uses of salt in gardening. Parkes published: * A Chemical Catechism, &c.;, 1806; 12th edit. 1826, edited, with memoir, by J. W. Hodgetts; 13th edit. 1834, revised by Edward William Brayley the younger. There was a pirated edition, with title A Grammar of Chemistry, 1809, bearing the name of David Blair. The sale was stopped by an injunction in chancery. There were many further American editions distinct from the above; and it was translated into French, German, Spanish, and Russian. * Rudiments of Chemistry, 1809, an abridgment of the Catechism; 4th edit. 1825. * Chemical Essays, 1815, 5 vols.; 3rd edit. 1830, edited by Hodgetts. * Thoughts on the Laws relating to Salt, 1817. * Letter to Farmers and Graziers on the Use of Salt in Agriculture, 1819. Parkes wrote papers On Nitric Acid (Philosophical Magazine, 1815), Reply to Dr. Henry ... respecting ... Bleaching by Oxymuriatic Acid (Thomson's Annals of Philosophy, 1816), and On the Analysis of some Roman Coins (Quarterly Journal of Science, 1826).

Agents. JC Comics was owned by John Carbonaro (Sept. 30, 1951 – Feb. 25, 2009).Carbonaro entry, ObitsforLife.com. Accessed Feb. 8, 2014. == History  Acquisition of T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents rights === Carbonaro acquired the rights to the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents from the defunct Tower Comics,Sodaro, Robert J. \\"The Resplendent Sound of T.H.U.N.D.E.R.!\\" Comics Value Annual (1999).

Additional , August 19, 2012. and tried to relaunch them with his own comic book company. === Association with Archie === Shortly after acquiring the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents rights, Carbonaro made an arrangement with Archie Comics to print and distribute JC Comics' titles, in conjunction with Archie's own attempted relaunch of their old superhero imprint Red Circle Comics. This resulted in cross-advertisements between the two companies and appearances of the companies' characters in each other's titles. Although Carbonaro was hired as an editor at Archie,\\"Archie Hires Carbonaro as Editor,\\" The Comics Journal, #75 (Sept. 1982), p. 15. Archie never owned the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents characters; nor was JC Comics an Archie imprint. From 1981 to 1984, JC Comics published three T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents titles: JCP Features, a single issue featuring early work by the artist Mark Texeira (which also contained an Archie Black Hood reprint); Hall of Fame Featuring the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, a three-issue series reprinting stories from the titular superhero team's original 1960s Tower Comics series, with new covers by artists including Steve Ditko and Bob Layton; and the two-issue series T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, featuring new stories. Ultimately, the wrap-up story of the latter series appeared in Red Circle's Blue Ribbon Comics anthology title. During this period, JC Comics also published a single issue of Basically Strange, a black- and-white horror comics magazine featuring artist Rick Bryant and writer- artist Bruce Jones. === Texas Comics === Also in 1983, Carbonaro arranged for the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents to appear in a crossover adventure with Justice Machine, then being published by Texas Comics. === Dispute with Deluxe Comics === In 1984, a former associate of Carbonaro named David M. Singer claimed that the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agent characters were in the public domain. He founded Deluxe Comics and began publishing a new series, Wally Wood's T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, featuring top artists including George Pérez, Dave Cockrum, Keith Giffen, Murphy Anderson, and Jerry Ordway. A lawsuit by Carbonaro asserting his copyright and trademark rights was heard in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York (John Carbonaro, et. al. v. David Singer, et. al., 84 Civ. 8737 (S.D.N.Y.),\\"Blood and T.H.U.N.D.E.R.\\" The Comics Journal #97 (April 1985), pp. 7-11. and via summary judgment, the judge ruled from the bench that the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents were indeed Carbonaro's property.\\"Deluxe suspends T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents,\\" The Comics Journal #100 (July 1985), pp. 20-22. Under the settlement, Carbonaro received an assignment of all rights to Wally Woods T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, and an undisclosed sum of money. === Omni Comix === Over the years, JC Comics tried many times to launch new T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents material. A 1995 deal with Penthouse Comix resulted in a single story in Omni Comix.Omni Comix #3 (Oct.–Nov. 1995). === Later attempts === In the early 2000s another attempt to revive the characters was planned with DC Comics, but the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents Archive and some statutettes are all that came of it. Following Carbonaro's 2009 death, DC briefly licensed the rights to the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents from owners Radiant Assets, and they have since been licensed by IDW Publishing. == Titles == ; Published by JC Comics: * JCP Features a.k.a. JCP Features the T.H.U.N.D.E.R.

Born in 1890 in Los Angeles, California, Menasco began his art career in the early days of Hollywood, when his \\"blood and thunder\\" posters enticed movie fans into theaters to watch the first silent pictures. He was commissioned to do mural paintings at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco for the World's Fair in 1915. His vivid use of colors and graphics won him recognition in Hollywood, where he worked on 33 films—29 times as art director and twice as set director. In 1925 he was the architecture and set director for the original film based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. This film received accolades for its innovative art direction and special effects. To quote one review in the NewTimes: \\"And while Harry O. Hoyt is credited as director, a host of fellow auteurs must take credit for Lost World's still impressive thrills, especially the effects work of Willis O'Brien (who would later animate King Kong in 1933) and the wild set design from Milton Menasco.\\" A complete list of Menasco's film credits is given here. In 1925 Menasco went to New York City as art director for a film making company and turned to advertising. He also painted portraits and water colors of horses and ships during this time which he sold in the City's galleries. During World War II, Life magazine commissioned him to draw air and sea battles to chronicle the war in Europe and in the Pacific Theater. After the war, Menasco moved to Kentucky to devote himself entirely to his real love, horse portraiture. Here he painted the equine racing greats of the nation and helped with art direction at the Thoroughbred Record and Sporting News. He and his wife purchased a farm where an old brick house built in the 18th century served for many years as his studio. Horsemen admired the richness and feeling reflected in Menasco's paintings, and his clients included John Hay Whitney, Isabel Dodge Sloane, President Ronald Reagan and Allaire du Pont. One of his first large paintings was for Lucille Markey depicting nine of her horses at Calumet Farm, including Citation, Coaltown and others grouped in the track with exercise boys up. Menasco also painted Secretariat for owner Penny Chenery. In 1953 Menasco painted the famous broodmare La Troienne in a work entitled \\"La Troienne and Her Foals: Eighteen Vignettes and One Painting Together in One Frame\\" for John Whitney. The painting was exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1999 it sold from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney through Sotheby's auction house for £74,000 (c. US$120,000). In 1957, Menasco painted Doubledogdare and Delta for Arthur B. Hancock, Jr. The artist explained that although the actual painting had taken him about three months to complete, \\"behind it goes all the training, study and experience of my life.\\" A distinguishing mark of Menasco's paintings is the detail to sky and landscape backgrounds. A perfect example of this detail is apparent in Nashua, with Eddie Arcaro up, painted by Menasco at Hialeah Park for Leslie Combs II. The background shows the track and a ring of palm trees. Milton Menasco died in 1974 of a heart attack at his farm in Versailles, Kentucky. ==External links== *Some of the paintings and drawings of Milton Menasco *Milton Menasco on IMDB Category:1890 births Category:1974 deaths Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:Modern painters Category:Equine artists Category:Artists from Los Angeles ","title":"Milton Menasco"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function D(s,a,o,c,u,n){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),i(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),i(h,null,y(n.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(H,[["render",D]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/51.md","filePath":"drive/51.md"}'),L={name:"drive/51.md"},E=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
