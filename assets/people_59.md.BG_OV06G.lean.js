Heading south-east with Bunerky Lough on right side ==Geography== Gortnacargy is bounded on the north by Tirnawannagh townland, on the south by Owengallees townland, on the west by Drumlougher and Teeboy townlands and on the east by Newtown, Templeport and Erraran townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, Bunerky Lough (Irish = Loch Bun Adhairc = The Lake of the Butt of the Horn, it also had an older name Moaneesk (Móin Naosgach = The Bog of the Snipe), Lakefield Lough, Lough Namoyle (Loch na Maoile = The Lake of the Bare Hill), a wood, small streams and dug wells. Gortnacargy is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 155 statute acres. ==History== The townland was inhabited in the Bronze Age as is evidenced by the prehistoric cemetery found there. In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into areas called ballibetoes. The \\"Survey of County Cavan\\" held by Sir John Davis on 6 September 1608 (Analecta Hibernica Vol.3, 1931) states- \\"Barony of Lissenouer alias Tullaghehaagh. The temporal lands within this barony are divided into Ballibetoes, each ballibetagh containing a certain number of polls, each poll containing one with another 24 acres of arable land, meadow and pasture.

Three separate graves which reputedly contained extended skeletons, one of which was accompanied by a rimsherd of pottery of food vessel type, were discovered when the cemetery was disturbed during the course of construction of an underground water storage tank in 1956. The site was subsequently excavated by Ó Ríordáin in 1957 yielding a further seven burials, several animal teeth and bones, numerous potsherds and other artifacts, among them a small blue glass bead and chert scrapers.

It consisted of the whole country. In staggered elections, it elected 100 of the 250 members of the House of Councillors by single non-transferable vote (SNTV). In an SNTV/SNTV parallel system, the other 150 members were also elected by SNTV, but in more decisive, lower-magnitude districts contiguous with the 47 prefectures, several of them single-member districts where SNTV is equivalent to first-past-the-post. In the 1983 regular election, the national district was replaced with the proportional district which is equally nationwide, but is often just called proportional district (hirei-ku) to avoid ambiguity. It elects the same number of members, but now in a proportional system from party lists. By 1986, the directly elected members from the national district were replaced by proportional party list members in both classes of the House of Councillors. == Highest and lowest-ranking winners == In the 1968 election, writer Shintarō Ishihara garnered more than 3 million votes, the all-time record. He stood as candidate for the Liberal Democratic Party; but unlike the current proportional preference system, where every preference vote for a candidate in the proportional district also counts towards the party total in the overall allocation of the proportional seats, high personal vote totals in the national district did not immediately benefit the party beyond the prestige of taking the top spot. On the other end of the winner list, the number of votes necessary to obtain a seat was around 150,000 in the immediate postwar years. Under the 1955 party system, more than 250,000 votes were needed to win a seat. By the 1970s when the baby boomers had entered the electorate, it took more than half a million votes for a candidate to be elected. Note: In many regular election years, including the 1st regular election of 1947 when all members had to be elected at once, the election was combined with a by-election to the class not up into one SNTV election. The top 50 members would always be elected for the full six year-term. If there were x vacancies in the other class, the 51st to (50+x)th ranking candidates would be elected to fill the vacant seats for the remaining 3-year term. {  +First and last winners in the House of Councillors nationwide district and their votes - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Regular election ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Leading candidate !! colspan=\\"2\\"  Second winner ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Last, 50th winner for a full term ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Last winner for a 3-year-term -  1st (1947)   Hajime Hoshi (D)  487,612  Sōzaemon Yanagawa (I/R)  480,927  Aisuke Okamoto (I/R)  123,679  #100  Jun'ichi Kunii (D)  68,128 -   2nd (1950)  Yamakawa Ryōichi (R)  610,611  Masao Takagi (R)  610,025  Yasoichi Mori (R)  150,244  #56  Yutaka Terao (L)  144,524 -  3rd (1953)   Kazushige Ugaki (R)  513,863  Yukio Kagayama (I)  494,543  Yoshio Ōtani (L)  162,624  #53  Yoshio Kusumi (R) (election later invalidated)  159,762 -   4th (1956)  Shizue Katō (S)  750,232  Masato Katō (I/R)  462,780  Seiji Uchimura (S)  254,137  #52  Hideo Konishi (L  240,711 -  5th (1959)   Masufumi Yoneda (L)  941,053  Morinosuke Kajima (L)  931,726  Masatoshi Tokunaga (L)  276,000  #52  Nagatoshi Mukai (S)  266,150 -   6th (1962)  Aki Fujiwara (L)  1,165,046  Shizue Katō (S)  1,110,024  Shūitsu Matsumura (L)  382,149  #51  Takematsu Abe (S)  376,901 -  7th (1965)   Morinosuke Kajima (L)  1,014,545  Shōichi Kasuga (C)  875,093  Shigeyoshi Kajiwara (L)  443,891  #52  Shigeru Ishimoto (I)  439,909 -   8th (1968)  Shintarō Ishihara (L)  3,012,552  Yukio Aoshima (I)  1,203,431  Shōichi Yokokawa (S)  477,493  #51  Mitsuru Kitamura (S)  461,500 -  9th (1971)   Hideo Den (S)  1,921,640  Aiko Anzai (L)  1,491,669  Danshi Tatekawa (I)  443,854  colspan=\\"3\\"  – -   10th (1974)  Teru Miyata (L)  2,595,236  Fusae Ichikawa (I/2Club)  1,938,169  Toshio Komaki (C)  575,110  #54  Chūkō Kondō (C)  573,211 -  11th (1977)   Hideo Den (S)  1,587,262  Satsuki Eda (SCF)  1,392,475  Atsushi Akiyama (S)  582,847  colspan=\\"3\\"  – -   12th (1980)  Fusae Ichikawa (I/2Club)  2,784,998  Yukio Aoshima (I/2Club)  2,247,157  Shizuo Wada (S)  642,554  colspan=\\"3\\"  – } == External links == * House of Councillors library: List of members 1947–2017 Category:Districts of the House of Councillors (Japan) ","title":"House of Councillors national district"},{"id":"56766456","text":"The 1977 World Table Tennis Championships – Men's Doubles was the 34th edition of the men's doubles championship.

Goldman School of Dental Medicine. == Life == Gianelly was born in Boston in 1936, and was the younger of two brothers. He attended Harvard College and played in the Harvard Crimson football team as a leading fullback and a linebacker in the varsity football team during the 1954–1956 season. He also was part of Harvard rugby and the Harvard track and field team. He received his dental degree from Harvard School of Dental Medicine in 1961 and received his orthodontics degree in 1963.

He died of a heart attack at the age of 72 on May 28 in 2009. Gianelly is survived by his wife, two children, and two grandchildren. == Orthodontics == Gianelly developed the bidimensional technique, in which two orthodontic different bracket slots are used in the mouth. An 0.018 slot is used on the central and lateral incisors and an 0.022 slot is used on the canines, premolars and molars. A wire such as 18x25 can allow a tight fit in the anterior brackets with the 0.018 slot and a loose fit in the posterior teeth with a 0.022 slot. Posteriorly, this allows less friction to be involved, which leads to a better sliding mechanism. There is about 0.004in slot between the posterior brackets and wire. Gianelly published over 90 scientific articles in his career, and co-authored textbooks including Biologic Basis of Orthodontics (1971), Ortodonzia, Concetti Practici (1985), and Bidimensional Technique: Theory and Practice (2000). == Awards == * Louise Ada Jarabak Memorial Award - 2009 * American Association of Orthodontists Annual Session - 2009 * Spencer N.

The Investigative Committee of Russia and the Russian Military Prosecutor's Office opened criminal cases concerning the crash. The Islamic militant group Jaysh al-Islam later claimed the responsibility for the crash; according to Ad-Diyar, five militants shot at the aircraft with heavy machine guns when it was 100 m from the ground.

He was probably the best two-year-old colt of his generation in England in 1923 when he won four of his five races including the July Stakes Lavant Stakes and Middle Park Stakes. In the following spring he gave his owner Aga Khan III the first of his many classic wins whe he took the 2000 Guineas. He failed to win again that year but returned to take three valuable prizes in 1925. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Diophon was a \\"handsome\\" chestnut horse bred in England by Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon. As a yearling he was put up for auction at Doncaster and bought for 4000 guineas by George Lambton on behalf of the Aga Khan. The colt was sent into training with Dick Dawson at Whatcombe, near Lambourn in Berkshire. He was from the first crop of foals sired by the 1919 Derby winner Grand Parade, the rest of whose stud career was disappointing. Diophon's dam Donetta was a durable racemare who competed until the age before becoming a very successful broodmare, with her other foals including Diadem, Dionysos (Irish St Leger) and Diadumenos (Jubilee Handicap). ==Racing career1923: two-year-old season=== Diophon's sire Grand Parade Diophon made a successful racecourse debut in the July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in which he was ridden George Hulme and won at odds of 7/1 from Obliterate. At the next Newmarket meeting he was allowed to walk over in the Chestefield takes when no horses appeared to oppose him and then took the Lavant Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Despite conceding weight to his seven opponents, Diophon started favourite for the Hopeful Stakes at Newmarket in early October but sustained his first defeat as he was beaten a head into second place by the previously unraced Woodend. Two weeks later, in \\"dismal weather conditions\\", Diophon started 2/1 favourite in an eleven-runner field for the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at the same track. He won by one and a half lengths from Plack, a filly who went on to win the 1000 Guineas, with Knight of the Garter third and Woodend unplaced. Although Diophon was considered a leading contender for the following year's British Classic Races he was regarded as being inferior to his female stablemate Mumtaz Mahal. ===1924: three-year-old season=== Diophon's owner Aga Khan III On 7 May, with Hulme in the saddle, Diophon started at odds of 11/2 in a twenty-runner field for the 116th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. In a very close finish, which saw the leaders racing up opposite sides of the wide Newmarket track, he was adjudged to have won by a head from Bright Knight with Green Fire a neck away in third. The photo-finish camera was not used in England at that time and most of the spectators disagreed with the judge's decision, believing that Bright Knight had crossed the line in front. The runner-up's jockey, Frank Bullock, stated that he was certain that he had won the race by at least a length. Diophon's victory provided a first classic success for both his owner and jockey. The 1924 Derby Stakes was run in exceptionally wet and testing conditions at Epsom Racecourse on 4 June. Despite doubts about his ability to cope with the heavy ground, Diophon was strongly fancied, but was never in contention and finished unplaced behind Sansovino who won easily. At Royal Ascot he ran in the Ribblesdale Stakes (then a race open to both colts and fillies) and finished second to Live Wire. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in August Diophon initially refused to go down to the start and had to be led by a mounted policeman. He took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten by Burslem, leading to speculation that he was not \\"in love with racing\\". ===1925: four-year-old season=== On 4 May 1925 Diophon contested the Lingfield Park Spring Stakes and finished second, beaten a head by Sansovino, with the Argentinian colt El Cacique three lengths back in third. At Newbury Racecourse on 10 June he was assigned a weight of 140 pounds for the Royal Plate and from Glommen and Invershin despite struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight. It was said by the Sporting Life that \\"no horse could have battled more heartily\\" and that the impression that he sometimes gave less than his best effort was created by the colt's oddly-set ears. He then finished second to Caravel in the Rous Memorial Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot, beaten a head in a \\"great finish\\". In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park on 17 July he came home third behind Polyphontes and Zambo in a thirteen-runner field. In the same month he won the £2595 Atlantic Cup at Liverpool. In August Diophon added an \\"easy\\" win in the Great Midland Breeders' Plate over ten furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Diophon an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== Diophon was retired from racing at the end of his four-year-old season to become a breeding stallion. The best of his offspring were Diolite, who won the 2000 Guineas in 1930 and the Irish Oaks winner Theresina. His overall record was disappointing and he was sold and exported to Greece. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1921 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 2-n Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Diophon"},{"id":"56766990","text":"Testimonies is a 1952 novel, set in North Wales, by the English author Patrick O'Brian. It was first published in the UK under the title Three Bear Witness, and in the US as Testimonies. ==Plot== The story is constructed from the testimonies that three witnesses give to an unnamed divine inquisitor: Joseph Aubrey Pugh, an Oxford don; Bronwen Vaughan, the woman he comes to love; and Mr Lloyd, a schoolmaster. Pugh says that he had been expecting the visitation, and that he will do his best to set down in writing what had taken place. According to his testimony, having become exhausted and demoralised by his academic life in Oxford, Pugh decides to rent a small cottage in North Wales for an extended break, intending to spend his time walking in the hills and reading. He throws himself into his new life, becoming friends with Emyr, son of the elderly owners of the neighbouring farm of Gelli, Mr and Mrs Vaughan. He helps out at Gelli to the best of his ability, though he disapproves of Emyr using strychnine to poison the foxes that threaten the farm’s lambs. Gradually Pugh finds himself falling in love with Emyr’s wife, Bronwen. On receiving an unexpected bequest, he abandons his academic career and takes the cottage as his permanent home. The schoolmaster, Mr Lloyd, tells the inquisitor that Bronwen had been brought up in a different valley and that she was ‘not our sort’. After marrying and coming to live at Gelli with Emyr and his parents she had been considered ‘proud’ and was unpopular with the local women. Bronwen testifies that her marriage was initially good, and they had a child, but that she became scared of Emyr after he was violent toward her one night. As her hatred of Emyr became increasingly evident, his mother turned against her and daily life at Gelli became very difficult. Pugh falls ill and moves to Gelli to recuperate. There he spends hours talking to Bronwen, and his love for her deepens. Mr Lloyd’s cousin, a famous preacher by the name of Pritchard Ellis, comes to stay. He is revered by the local people for the power of his public oratory, but in private he is a hypocrite and sexual voyeur. After sexually touching Bronwen when they are alone, and being repulsed, he retaliates by spreading false rumours that Pugh and Bronwen are committing adultery. He preaches a powerful two-hour sermon in chapel denouncing Bronwen and Pugh's ‘wickedness’, though without mentioning them by name, which results in their being ostracised by the community. One night Emyr is sexually violent to Bronwen again, and she tells the inquisitor that her husband nearly killed her. Pugh sees her the next day and realises what Emyr has done. He departs for a long and nightmarish walk through the mountains, contemplating suicide. Seriously hurt, Bronwen is put to bed and a doctor is called. Old Mrs Vaughan comes in with some medicine and Bronwen, after taking a sip, realises immediately that it is laced with strychnine. She drinks it and dies. Pugh returns, utterly exhausted, and lies unconscious before being awakened to learn of Bronwen’s fate. ==Background== The novel's setting is closely based on Cwm Croesor in North Wales, where O'Brian and his wife had rented a small cottage in 1946 as an escape from post-war London. The character of Pugh is semi-autobiographical, and his intended monograph The Bestiary Before Isidore of Seville was a subject that O'Brian later said he had himself been working on before the war. According to his step-son and biographer Nikolai Tolstoy, the fiction provided \\"the flimsiest of veils for [the author's] deepest personal concerns\\". He notes that Pugh - like O'Brian himself - \\"sets himself up as a gentleman and adopts a name more appropriate to his improved status, concerning which he resents being questioned\\". ==Publication== The novel was first published in 1952, the UK version appearing under the title Three Bear Witness as O'Brian's UK publishers Secker & Warburg were of the view that his preferred title Testimonies would be difficult to sell. In the US it was published by Harcourt, Brace as Testimonies. Unaware that O'Brian had changed his name in 1945 from Richard Patrick Russ, many reviewers assumed the novel to be the author's first. Geoff Hunt cover used on HarperCollins reissue In 1994 the UK version was renamed Testimonies and re-published by HarperCollins with new cover art by Geoff Hunt, the cover-artist for the re-issued volumes of the Aubrey–Maturin series. Hunt illustrates a cottage almost identical with the real-life cottage in Cwm Croesor that O'Brian and his wife had rented in 1946. In the US the novel was reissued in 1993 by Norton. ==Literary significance and criticism== The first English reviews were not encouraging. On 10 May 1952, an unnamed Times reviewer called the book \\"a slight and technically immature piece of work, loose-jointed and clumsy in construction to the point of amateurishness\\", though conceding that the book \\"leaves an impression of genuine talent\\". On 16 May the Times Literary Supplement called it \\"a quiet little story of much merit\\", while likewise considering its central literary device to be 'clumsy'. The US reviews were entirely different. In an influential omnibus review in Partisan Review,Schwartz, Delmore Partisan Review, Vol 19, No 6, 1952, quoted in Delmore Schwartz praised the book at the expense of John Steinbeck, Evelyn Waugh, Angus Wilson and Ernest Hemingway. Schwartz said \\"To read a first novel by an unknown author which, sentence by sentence and page by page makes one say: he can't keep going at this pace, the intensity is bound to break down, the perfection of tone can't be maintained - is to rejoice in an experience of pleasure and astonishment ... [It] makes one think of a great ballad or a Biblical story ... The reader, drawn forward by lyric eloquence and the story's fascination, discovers in the end that he has encountered in a new way the sphinx and the riddle of existence itself\\". He concluded by comparing O'Brian's prose to the lyrics of the great Irish poet W. B. Yeats.Schwartz, Delmore, 1952, reprinted as preface to In later editions of the book, part of Schwartz's review was reprinted as a preface. The New York Herald Tribune Book Review called it \\"one of the finest books to come along for some time\\".Stallings, Sylvia New York Herald Tribune Book Review, 24 August 1952, quoted in , while Saturday Review said that \\"Mr. O'Brian has made a story that moves to its end with the rightness and inevitability we think of as Greek\\".La Farge, Oliver Saturday Review, 23 August 1952, quoted in The New York Times Book Review dubbed the book \\"A rare and beautiful novel, deceptively modest in form, never faltering in the unobtrusive skill of its poetry and dramatic dimensions\\". The character of Bronwen was singled out for particular praise as \\"an altogether touching and marvelous woman, so persuasively and sympathetically portrayed that she deserves a place among great heroines - for all the differences of setting and scale, [she] has some of the stature of an Anna Karenina\\". The reviewer noted the author’s expert pacing of the story, his extraordinary gift for the visual scene, and his brilliant ear for the subtle counterpoint of sound in speech. On the book's first publication, Kirkus Reviews considered the novel to be of \\"unassuming proportion and immaculate design\\". Reviewing the 1993 US re-issue, the magazine noted a \\"chaste and disciplined prose [that lends] purity to a quiet, tragic idyll for the discriminating reader\\". ==Adaptations== A dramatised adaptation of the book by Colin Haydn Evans was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2002. The audio was recorded by a listener and is available on the Internet Archive. (Free audio recording) ==Relationship with later works== The surnames Aubrey and Maturin - later to be used for the protagonists of O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series of nautical historical novels - both appear in Testimonies. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * ==External links== * Category:1952 British novels Category:Novels by Patrick O'Brian Category:1952 in Wales Category:Novels set in Wales Category:British autobiographical novels ","title":"Testimonies (novel)"},{"id":"56766991","text":"Shane McClanahan (born April 28, 1997) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball (MLB). ==Career== McClanahan attended Cape Coral High School in Cape Coral, Florida.

He attended the local county school in Tottenham, then went on to read geography at University College London (UCL). At that time there was no department of anthropology at UCL; the geography department had interests in ethnography and archaeology, but for the most part it was the domain of Grafton Elliot Smith, a professor of anatomy and noted proponent of hyperdiffusionism. Forde studied under Smith and, upon completing his bachelor's degree in 1924, he was appointed a lecturer in the department of anatomy. His earliest work was influenced by Smith's belief that all of human civilisation originated in ancient Egypt. In his first book, Ancient Mariners (1928), Forde traced the origins of shipbuilding and maritime navigation to Egypt, whence he supposed it was carried around the world in ancient voyages: Smith and Forde also collaborated on the excavation of a Bronze Age tumulus near Dunstable. The main focus of his research in the anatomy department, however, was the megalithic cultures of prehistoric western Europe. In this he was influenced by the culture historical theories of V. Gordon Childe, who would become a lifelong friend and collaborator. Childe tempered Forde's enthusiasm for hyperdiffusionism, but Forde still advanced the idea that European megaliths were a \\"degenerated\\" imitation of monuments in the Near East. This theory remained influential in archaeology for many years. Forde's archaeological work won him the Society of Antiquaries' prestigious Franks Studentship in 1924, and in 1928 he was awarded a doctorate in prehistoric archaeology. == Fellowship at Berkeley (1928–1930) == After receiving his doctorate, Forde won a Commonwealth Fellowship to work with the American anthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie at the University of California, Berkeley. He had been introduced to Lowie during the latter's visit to London in 1924. Both Kroeber and Lowie were students of Franz Boas, making Berkeley an influential early centre of what became known as Boasian anthropology. The intellectual climate there—very different to anthropology in Britain—had a profound effect on Forde's scholarship. He would later refer to it as his \\"transatlantic noviciate\\". Both Kroeber and Lowie also had backgrounds in archaeology, but were committed to the Boasian four field approach and the holistic study of humanity. They therefore encouraged Forde to conduct ethnographic fieldwork with local Native American tribes. He worked with the Yuma of the lower Colorado river valley and the Hopi of northern Arizona, leading to his most well-known work, Habitat, Economy and Society: a Geographical Introduction to Ethnology (1934). At Berkeley, he was trained in ecological anthropology and brought this tradition with him back to the UK. == Chair at Aberystwyth University (University College of Wales, Aberystwyth) 1930-1945 == In 1930, when still only 28 years old, Daryll Forde was appointed Gregynog Professor of Geography and Anthropology at the University of Wales at Aberystwyth Lewis, Ioan. 1973. 'Obituaries'. Proceedings of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 1973, p. 56-58 . It was here, aged 31, that he commenced a 5 year excavation programme on the local Iron Age hillfort of Pen Dinas between 1933-37, answering many earlier calls made during the 1920s for the excavation and dating of a local hillfort. Contemporary photographs of the excavation https://coflein.gov.uk/en/site/92236/details/pendinas-hillfort- aberystwyth show the young Daryll Forde on site, well-dressed among the workmen and clearly enjoying directing one of the largest hillfort excavations in southern Britain at that time. It was during his early years at Aberystwyth in 1934 that he also published his influential text book 'Habitat, Economy and Society'. == Later career == From 1945 he worked at University College London, and built a school of American-style cultural anthropology there, distinct from the social anthropology of British-trained contemporaries such as Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Meyer Fortes and E. E. Evans-Pritchard. From 1935 he worked in Nigeria with the Yakö people. His work in Africa resulted in several volumes of African Worlds: Studies in the Cosmological Ideas and Social Values of African Peoples (1954).

He was also a visiting scholar at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley in 2002. ==President of University of Alaska system== Johnsen meeting with Senator Lisa Murkowski in 2020. Johnsen was appointed the president of the University of Alaska system on July 28, 2015. As the system president, his priorities included a systemwide Title IX compliance effort, restructuring of academic programs and administrative services of the university aligning with Alaska's primary and secondary education sectors, and a systemwide push to achieve the State of Alaska's goal for 65 percent of Alaska's working age population to have a post-secondary degree or certificate of value by 2025. ===University of Alaska System budget cuts === Johnsen assumed the role of president during a period of budget cuts. The system had taken consecutive years of budget cuts as the state struggled with collapsed oil revenues. Johnsen made the case for supporting Alaska's higher education system, both extolling the virtues of education and the role the university can play in bolstering the state's economy. In July 2019, Johnsen presented possible structuring models for the university in the wake of declaration of financial exigency after 41% cuts to state funding. He said that \\"severe cuts were the only way to deal with the system's budget crisis\\". ===Votes of No Confidence=== Johnsen has faced votes of no confidence during his tenure, in 2017 and 2019, from both students and faculty across multiple universities. These votes of no confidence cited \\"a series of coercive and intimidating letters that UA President Jim Johnsen sent to the chancellors of UAA, UAF, and UAS,\\" a letter of non-compliance with accreditation standards regarding clearly defined governance from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, and \\"a general trend of disregard for the wants and needs of the individual campuses in favor of President Johnsen’s plans.\\" ===Resignation=== Johnsen tendered his resignation amid blowback from a Wisconsin job search, among other reasons. Johnsen's resignation was accepted by the University of Alaska Board of Regents on June 22, 2020. He continued to be the president until July 1, 2020. ==Public Service== Johnsen is a commissioner on the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, a commissioner on the Denali Commission and a member of the board of directors of the Alaska Aerospace Corporation. He is past chair of the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education and chair of the Alaska Student Loan Corporation. ==Candidacy for University of Wisconsin System President== In June 2020, Johnsen was named the only named finalist in the University of Wisconsin system's presidential search. This is due in part to other applicants for this position withdrawing their names, fearing backlash for participating in this search during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to criticism from UW faculty, students who called it a \\"Failed result of a flawed search process\\".

Burleson, 255 U.S. 407 (1921), was a Supreme Court ruling that upheld the United States Postmaster General's power to revoke second-class mail privileges (the type of mail most newspapers and magazines qualify as) under the Espionage Act of 1917.Milwaukee Social Democratic Pub. Co. v. Burleson, . The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the owners of the Milwaukee Leader, a socialist daily newspaper in Milwaukee, Wisconsin due to Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson's revocation of the Leader's second-class mailing privileges on the grounds of past anti-war articles it had published. The court ruled 7-2 in favor of the federal government, with Justice Clarke delivering the majority opinion while Justices Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. dissented. == Legal background == In 1917, Congress enacted the Espionage Act, which was intended to prohibit interference with the United States war effort during World War I. Both state and Federal government entities targeted left-wing organizations and publications under the Act. Despite numerous challenges to the Act's constitutionality, largely on First Amendment grounds, the Supreme Court sustained the Act as constitutional. Under the Act, the Federal government frequently denied access to the public mail system to leftist organizations and publications. The socialist publication The Masses challenged this regulation in Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten, 244 F. 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1917), in which a federal district court found the practice unconstitutional. This ruling was subsequently undermined by Supreme Court decisions about the Act from 1918 through 1921. == Clash with Burleson == In 1911, the Office of the Postmaster General granted the Milwaukee Leader, published by the Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Company, the privilege of second-class mail status. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the Milwaukee Leader began running articles condemning United States involvement: > [I]t was declared in the quoted articles that the war was unjustifiable and > dishonorable on our part, a capitalistic war, which had been forced upon the > people by a class to serve its selfish ends. Our government was denounced as > a \\"plutocratic republic,\\" a financial and political autocracy, and resident > Russians were praised for defaming it. Other articles denounced the draft > law as unconstitutional, arbitrary, and oppressive, with the implied counsel > that it should not be respected or obeyed, and it was represented that > soldiers in France were becoming insane in such numbers that long trains of > closed cars were being used to convey them away from the battle front. It > was confidently asserted that the Constitution of the United States was > purposely made difficult of amendment in order that we might not have real > democracy in this country, the President was denounced as an autocrat, and > the war legislation as having been passed by a \\"rubber stamp > Congress.\\"Burleson, 255 U.S. at 413-414. As a result, the Postmaster General held a hearing on September 22, 1917, to revoke the Milwaukee Leader's second class status and declare its newspaper \\"unmailable.\\" Though the Milwaukee Leader was represented at the hearing, the Postmaster General found against the newspaper, and revoked its second class status and barred it from use of the postal system. The government based its decision on allegations that the newspaper published \\"false reports and false statements . . . with intent to interfere with the success of military operations\\" of the United States, to assist in the success of the Central Powers, and to interfere with military recruitment.Burleson, 255 U.S. at 412.f == Decision  Majority === Justice Clarke penned the majority opinion on behalf of Chief Justice Taft and Justices McKenna, Day, Devanter, Pitney, and McReynolds. Clarke said of the anti-war articles run by the Leader: \\"[They] contained false reports and false statements, published with intent to interfere with the success of the military operations of our government, to promote the success of its enemies, and to obstruct its recruiting and enlistment service. For this cause, exercising the power which we have seen had been invested in the Postmaster General by statute for almost 40 years, and which had frequently been exercised by his predecessors, the respondent revoked the second-class privilege which had been granted to the relator.\\" Clarke also made reference to the Espionage Act being a legitimate, constitutional piece of legislature. === Dissent === Justice Brandeis wrote a lengthy dissent on the subject, questioning the Postmaster General's powers in light of due process, where he called the Leader's punishment \\"not only unusual in character; it is, so far as known, unprecedented in American legal history.\\" The vague and sweeping nature of the Postmaster General's powers exercised outside of wartime also disturbed Brandeis, and he concluded the body of his dissent by saying \\"If, under the Constitution, administrative officers may, as a mere incident of the peacetime administration of their departments, be vested with the power to issue such orders as this, there is little of substance in our Bill of Rights, and in every extension of governmental functions lurks a new danger to civil liberty.\\" Justice Holmes, who dissented along with Brandeis, had a much shorter dissent. Agreeing with much of what Brandeis had already said, Holmes echoed Brandeis' contention that the powers afforded the Postmaster General by Congress were unprecedented and a threat to free speech: \\"The United States may give up the post office when it sees fit, but, while it carries it on, the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues, and it would take very strong language to convince me that Congress ever intended to give such a practically despotic power to any one man. There is no pretence that it has done so. Therefore, I do not consider the limits of its constitutional power. . .[the revocation] was unjustified by statute and was a serious attack upon liberties that not even the war induced Congress to infringe.\\" == See also == * Schenck v.

The manual labor model was intended to make educational opportunities more widely available to students with limited means, and to make the schools more viable economically. The work was seen as morally beneficial as well as healthful; at the time, this was innovative and equalitarian thinking. According to the trustees of the Lane Theological Seminary: These \\"colleges\\" usually included what we would today (2019) call high school (\\"preparatory\\") as well as college level instruction. At the time, the only public schools were at the elementary level, and there were no rules distinguishing colleges from high schools. The four states with the largest number of such schools were New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. ==George W. Gale== George W. Gale was the founder of the first and best-known American example, the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry, and he thought the concept was his, although there are European predecessors. He and many of the other pious Yankees were persuaded that manual labor was to be the central practical feature of the coming American, Christian program of education. In 1830 Gale wrote: \\"Depend on it, Brother Finney, none of us have estimated the importance of this System of Education. It will be to the moral world what the lever of Archimedes, could he have found a fulcrum, would have been to the natural.\\" As he put it slightly later, in his circular and plan for Knox College, \\"the manual labor system, if properly sustained and conducted, ...is peculiarly adapted...to qualify men for the self-denying and arduous duties of the gospel ministry, especially in our new settlements and missionary fields abroad.\\" ==Theodore Weld and the Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions== Theodore Dwight Weld had studied under Gale for three years, and was convinced of the wisdom of the manual labor movement. He was a highly successful young lecturer on temperance, and caught the attention of the philanthropist Tappan brothers, Arthur and Lewis. They invited him to New York and tried to get him to accept an appointment as minister, but he declined, saying he was not prepared. Since he was \\"a living, breathing, and eloquently-speaking exhibit of the results of manual-labor-with-study,\\", the brothers, trying to support and encourage him, hired him for a year as an agent of the manual labor movement. For the purpose they created in 1831 a Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions, \\"literary institutions\\" being non-theological schools, as in \\"In every literary institution there are a number of hours daily, in which nothing is required of the student.\\" The only known activities of the Society were hiring Weld for the year 1832, hosting him as speaker, and publishing his report. According to its constitution, it was \\"the object of this society to collect and diffuse information, calculated to promote the establishment and prosperity of manual labor schools and seminaries in the United States, and to introduce the system of manual labor into institutions now established.\\" The Society's charge to Weld is lost, but to judge from his 100-page, carefully organized report, he was charged with traveling and investigating manual labor education as it then existed, and making suggestions for its improvement and prosperity. \\"We wish you to keep a minute and accurate journal of your tour, embracing all the facts which you collect, with such remarks and inferences as you may think proper.\\" He was also \\"to ascertain to what extent the manual labor system was suited to conditions in the West\\" (the Ohio valley). He was \\"to find a site for a great national manual labor institution where training for the western ministry could be provided for poor but earnest young men who had dedicated their lives to the home missionary cause in the 'vast valley of the Mississippi.'\\" In Weld's January, 1833, report to the Society he stated that \\"In prosecuting the business of my agency, I have traveled during the year four thousand five hundred and seventy-five miles miles [7,364 km]; in public conveyances [boat and stagecoach], 2,630 [4,230 km]; on horseback, 1,800 [2,900 km]; on foot, 145 [233 km]. I have made two hundred and thirty-six public addresses.\\" A newspaper published a summary of his report: Weld recommended Cincinnati, which he visited twice, as \\"the logical location [for the new school]. Cincinnati was the focal center of population and commerce in the Ohio valley.\\" The new and barely-functioning Lane Theological Seminary in Walnut Hills, Ohio, near Cincinnati, was coincidentally looking for students. On Weld's recommendation, the Tappans chose it as the site for a national institution. See Lane Theological Seminary for more on it. With Weld very much at the head of it, the first national debate on slavery in the United States was held there, followed by the first organized student movement; students resigned en masse, many going to the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute. ==The need for a New England school== The New Hampshire Anti-Slavery Society, at its first convention, in 1834, passed a resolution expressing its support for the New England Anti-Slavery Society's resolution calling for a manual labor school \\"in some most eligible portion of New England\\", to address \\"the general want of mental cultivation of the colored population of our country\\". ==Incomplete list of manual labor schools== *Albany Manual Labor Academy, Albany, Ohio, 1850–1862.

Boone calls the manual labor movement \\"a 'craze', that soon ran its course (p. 76). ==The failure of manual labor in colleges== Although a variety of colleges incorporated manual labor to some degree, in most cases it was abandoned after only a few years, and it was all but gone by 1850. According to Herbert Lull, the reasons for its failure are: # Labor was treated as a source of revenue, to support unrelated college activities. # The labor was not linked in any way to the students' educational or career goals. Agricultural labor, for example, was of little relevance to the student preparing for a pulpit. # The work became drudgery. Students wanted some leisure, some play. # The work did not fulfill the financial expectations colleges had of it. As summarized by Geoffrey Blodgett in his analysis of its quick disappearance at Oberlin: However, \\"the 'manual labor' movement waxed and waned in the 1830s, but in one form or another, its ideas never died.\\" It is a predecessor of the land-grant university, a generation later. ==See also== * Cooperative education * Land- grant university * Work college * Work-study ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * It is unsigned; Bronson's name is taken from . * * Power, Edward J. \\"Hand and Head: The Manual Labor School Movement\\", A Legacy of Learning: A History of Western Education.

The game is structured into short, loosely connected episodes of Chuchel's struggles to retrieve and keep the cherry; the episodic nature is emphasized by some levels showing the title. In the last level, it is revealed that the giant hand teasing Chuchel with the cherry is in fact a larger Chuchel-style creature named Chrchel; it swallows Chuchel and Kekel who retrieve the cherry from its stomach, and climb up to its brain to switch it from \\"grumpy\\" to \\"happy\\". The now-happy giant then delivers Chuchel and Kekel back to their home, where they finally split and eat the cherry, only to get a huge pile brought by the giant, who then starts chasing a large pear carried by an even larger hand. ==Gameplay== The game consists of 30 levels. The player controls the eponymous Chuchel whose task is to retrieve a cherry. Levels are different and most of them are played as point-and-click adventure but some consist of minigames including spoofs of Pac-Man, Flappy Bird, Tetris, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong. And Super Mario Bros When Chuchel retrieves the Cherry, antagonist Chrchel shows up and steals it. Chuchel is aided by his pet Kekel who helps him to get the Cherry. ==Development== Original colour on the left and the new colour is on the right. The game was developed by Amanita Design. Designer Jaromír Plachý started to work on the game after he finished Botanicula in 2012. Plachý stated that he wanted to make an interactive cartoon with funny animation. He came up with the character of Chuchel (the word \\"chuchel\\" does not \\"officially\\" exist,http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/?slovo=chuchel but it's an apparent combination of two similar Czech words \\"chumel\\"http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/?slovo=chumel (clamp or tangle) and \\"chuchvalec\\"http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/?slovo=chuchvalec (tangled mass or clot)) when he decided to draw the first thing that comes to his mind. Plachý then designed environments and turned them into actual levels. On December 20, 2018, Amanita Design released an update for the game changing Chuchel's body color to orange, in response to the character being misinterpreted by some reactions as a racist stereotype called Blackface. Some levels were also slightly changed to match Chuchel's new colour. ==Reception== Chuchel received generally positive reviews from critics. It holds 81/100 on Metacritic. The game won the award for Excellence in Visual Art at the Independent Games Festival, and was nominated for \\"Best Visual Design\\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, and for the Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game at the New York Game Awards. The game was a runner-up in the Best Visual Design category in the 2018 Edge awards. ==References== Keyes, Rob (January 3, 2019). \\"2018 New York Game Awards Nominees Revealed Revdl\\". Screen Rant.

She was a civil rights activist, serving as a member of both the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Nation of Islam (NOI). Simmons has received a number of prestigious fellowships, including a Fulbright Fellowship, USAID Fellowships, and an American Center of Oriental Research Fellowship. == Early life and education == Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where she was raised by her Baptist grandmother, Rhonda Bell Robinson. The great-granddaughter of a slave, Simmons was raised with the knowledge of her family history and the ways in which it was affected by slavery and its legacies. Her family valued and encouraged her to pursue education, and she became the first in her family to attend college. Simmons enrolled at Spelman College in 1962. Soon after she began classes, she was summoned by the dean of students, who deemed her natural hair to be an \\"embarrassment\\" to the school and its expectations that students be \\"well- groomed.\\" This would become one of several disputes Simmons experienced with the Spelman administration as her involvement with student activism began to increase. In 1989, Simmons completed her B.A. at Antioch University, where she studied Human Services. She went on to study at Temple University, receiving an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Religion with a focus on Islam, and a Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies. She wrote her dissertation on \\"The Contemporary Impact of Shari'ah Law on Women's Lives in Jordan and Palestine.\\" === Student activism === Simmons was inspired to get involved in the civil rights movement by two of her professors, Staughton Lynd and Esta Seaton, who contextualized the current movement with historic African-American struggle. Also influential in Simmons' increasing activism were Howard Zinn, Spelman's History Department head, and Vincent Harding and Rosemarie Freeny Harding, co- directors of Atlanta's Mennonite House. Simmons began volunteering at the nearby Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) headquarters alongside SNCC chair John Lewis, SNCC executive secretary James Forman, and fellow Spelman student Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson. Simmons was careful to participate in office work only, where she was less likely to draw attention from her family and from the Spelman administration. She also became involved with the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights early on during her time at Spelman. In 1963, she successfully ran to become a Spelman representative to SNCC's coordinating committee. In early January 1964, Simmons was arrested along with other Spelman students for participating in a lunch-counter demonstration at Lester Maddox's Pickrick restaurant. She spent a night in jail and was again summoned by the dean of students, who put her on academic probation for violating Spelman's prohibitions on civil rights demonstrations. This did not prevent Simmons from participating in another sit-in at a Krystal restaurant a few days later, where she was once again arrested. This time, she spent three nights in jail, was rebuked by Spelman President Manley, and had her scholarship revoked. In light of these punitive measures, friends and fellow demonstrators throughout the Atlanta University Center rallied to Simmons' support, organizing a march to President Manley's house. As a consequence, Simmons was allowed to remain at Spelman, though under strict probation. Simmons continued taking classes during the spring of 1964, and she assisted Staughton Lynd in developing curriculum for the upcoming Mississippi Freedom Summer Project and preparing materials for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Engaged by Freedom Summer materials and encouraged by fellow students, Staughton Lynd, and Vincent Harding, Simmons decided to spend the summer of 1964 volunteering with the Mississippi Freedom project. Spelman administrators informed Simmons' family of this decision, who feared for Simmons' safety in working in an area known for Ku Klux Klan violence. They acted decisively to prevent her from leaving, bringing her home and intercepting correspondence from SNCC. Through covert money transfers from SNCC, Simmons was finally able to travel to Mississippi, much to the dismay of her family. Despite this disapproval, Simmons traveled to Oxford, Ohio for orientation, and then on to Mississippi. In Oxford, Simmons served as project trainer, working with Staughton Lynd in his capacity as orientation director, as well as Vincent Harding. In Mississippi, Simmons was sent to the city of Laurel in Jones County, an area notorious for Klan violence. In this environment, Simmons feared for her life, regularly encountering hostility and police harassment. When her project director, Lester McKinney, was sent to jail, Simmons was appointed to replace him, despite her lack of field organizing experience. She thus became one of only seven female Freedom Summer project directors. Under Simmons' direction, Freedom Summer volunteers operated a Freedom School, opened a day care, registered voters, and established a library. == Civil rights activism  1964-1966 === At the end of Freedom Summer, Simmons decided to stay in Laurel rather than return to Spelman. While Simmons worked in Laurel, she resided in the nearby city of Hattiesburg, since Laurel was too dangerous to live in. She served as freedom school director of SNCC's Laurel Mississippi project, providing curriculum development for freedom schools. As a young, black, and female leader in SNCC, Simmons faced both racism and sexism. She was also fearful of sexual violence, given that she was responsible for a predominantly white and male cohort of volunteers and had already experienced sexual violence during her orientation session in Ohio. Accordingly, she created an anti-sexual harassment policy for the Laurel Project, which she named the \\"Amazon Project.\\" The policy was one of the first of its kind in SNCC. It was during her time in Mississippi that Simmons began identifying as a feminist. In 1965, after spending eighteen months in Laurel, Simmons returned to Atlanta, psychologically scarred by the violence she had witnessed. At the recommendation of James Forman, she took a break from organizing and worked as a fundraiser in SNCC's New York City office. A year later, Simmons returned to activism in the South. In 1966, she was hired as co-director on the newly formed SNCC Atlanta Project alongside fellow SNCC activist Bill Ware in the Vine City neighborhood. The Atlanta Project was an early grassroots expression of Black Power, focusing its efforts on political mobilization and urban improvement. Simmons also continued her work with freedom school initiatives with the Project. Simmons used her time on the Atlanta Project to evaluate civil rights movement tactics and develop preliminary theories of Black Power. For instance, she helped draft the project's position paper on Black Power, which became controversial for its commentary on white members of SNCC. Simmons harbored a number of frustrations with white SNCC organizers, who she felt disrespected her authority and used up resources in being trained to work in black communities. She therefore advocated for whites to work on racial justice issues in white communities, where they could work in parallel with black organizers. These stances, as expressed in the project's Black Power position paper, were controversial and not necessarily indicative of the views of SNCC leaders, including James Forman and head of research Jack Minnis. Simmons also joined black female SNCC activists in critiquing increasing interracial relationships between black men and white women, which were perceived as a rejection of black women. In the late 1960s, Simmons left Atlanta for Philadelphia, where she spent twenty years working for the American Friends Service Committee. She also served as treasurer of the National Black Independent Party. === 1967-1972 === During her time in SNCC, Simmons first heard Malcolm X on a record and was instantly drawn to his message. She officially joined the Nation of Islam (NOI) in 1967 and converted to Islam. While a member of the NOI, Simmons also served as Midwest region coordinator for the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) while living in Chicago. From Chicago, Simmons and her husband Michael Simmons moved to New York, joining Minister Louis Farrakhan's Mosque No. 7. In her reflections of her time spent with the NOI, Simmons expressed displeasure with the gender hierarchy that governed women's limited role in organizing: > \\"Unlike the SNCC, however, there was really no place for a woman to exercise > what I considered real leadership as it had been in SNCC. As I was to learn > later, my role as a woman in the NOI was to be a 'symbol of purity and > chastity' and to be obedient and submissive to male authority, and the > hallmark of my existence was that of mother of many children and a dutiful > wife and helper to my husband, to whom I should defer in all matters of > importance.\\" Simmons directly contravened NOI teachings in a number of ways, for instance, by using birth control despite the beliefs of NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, who viewed birth control as an attack on black families. Simmons also refrained from wearing the Muslim Girls Training uniform and headscarf, choosing not to complicate her organizing efforts with religious expression. Other criticisms Simmons expressed regarding the NOI concerned the emphasis on money that burdened poor members, the militaristic and gendered hierarchy, and the use of corporal punishments. She left the organization in 1972. == Islamic feminist research and advocacy == Beginning in 1971, Simmons spent seventeen years as a disciple of Sufi Sheikh Muhammad Raheem Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, a renowned leader of Islamic mysticism. Simmons received the name \\"Zoharah\\" from Muhaiyaddeen. She was one of his first American students, and she remains an active member of the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship and Mosque. As part of her work in academia, Simmons researched the contemporary impact of Sharia law on Muslim women in various communities, traveling to Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. She also spent some time living in Amman, Jordan, in order to conduct research for her academic dissertation. Her teaching at the University of Florida centers on race, gender, and religion, particularly on African American religious traditions and women's relationship with Islam. In her current work, she seeks to separate the religion of Islam with various cultural interpretations, sometimes looking to history for forgotten and dismissed interpretations. She believes that only through gender equality will Islam be able to successfully thrive in America, and has expressed dismay over the ignorance in American Muslim communities of the Islamic feminist movement. She additionally believes that Islamic feminism recalls the respect for women expressed in the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad's teachings that has been forgotten in more modern interpretations. Her writings also address issues facing African Americans, such as teen pregnancy, as well as broader concerns related to Third World inequities. == Personal life == Simmons formed a romantic relationship with Michael Simmons, a fellow Atlanta Project organizer, after recruiting him in 1965 to work on Julian Bond's campaign for a Georgia state legislature seat. The couple was required to marry upon joining the Nation of Islam in order to continue living together. They have one daughter, Aishah Shahidah Simmons, who is an award-winning feminist documentary filmmaker. Both Simmons and her daughter have been outspoken about Aishah's experiences with rape and incest. == Writings == * \\"Striving for Muslim Women's Human Rights--Before and Beyond Beijing,\\" Syracuse University Press (2000) * \\"Racism in Higher Education,\\" University of Florida Journal of Law and Public Policy (2002) * \\"Are we up to the challenge?

Before working in the garment industry, Pinkney attended Manhattan Trade School. In 1925 Pinkney received a scholarship to Brookwood Labor College sponsored by the American Fund for Public Service (AFPS), which supported radical political causes. Her scholarship at Brockwood was extended two years due to her academic success, and Pinkney was recognized as a class speaker at graduation. == Activism == Pinkney joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in the 1920s and was quickly identified as a promising leader. She worked for several years before attending Brockwood Labor College. After graduating, she returned to the industry but was quickly appointed as a union organizer in 1929. Pinkney was instrumental in the IGLWU's September 1929 drive to enroll black garment workers. She spoke alongside A. Philip Randolph, who lead the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and ILGWU Vice President Julius Hochman at St. Luke's in Harlem. Randolph endorsed Pinkney as an organizer for the ILGWU, calling her \\"a capable young woman\\". Pinkney worked beyond the garment district and was active in both the Harlem and Brooklyn communities.

Cyber threats or attacks to elections or voting infrastructure could be carried out by insiders within a voting jurisdiction, or by a variety of other actors ranging from nefarious nation-states, to organized cyber criminals to lone-wolf hackers. Motives may range from a desire to influence the election outcome, to discrediting democratic processes, to creating public distrust or even political upheaval. == United States == The U.S. is characterized by a highly decentralized election administration system. Elections are a constitutional responsibility of state and local election entities such as secretaries of state, election directors, county clerks or other local level officials encompassing more than 6,000+ local subdivisions nationwide. However, election security has been characterized as a national security concern increasingly drawing the involvement of federal government entities such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In early 2016, Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security designated elections as “critical infrastructure” making the subsector eligible to receive prioritized cybersecurity assistance and other federal protections from the Department of Homeland Security. The designation applies to storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments. In particular, hackers falsifying official instructions before an election could affect voter turnout or hackers falsifying online results after an election could sow discord. Election security has become a major focus and area of debate in recent years, especially since the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. In 2017, DHS confirmed that a U.S. foreign adversary, Russia, attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election via “a multi- faceted approach intended to undermine confidence in [the American] democratic process.\\" This included conducting cyber espionage against political targets, launching propaganda or “information operations” (IO) campaigns on social media, and accessing elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards. On September 22, 2017, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified 21 states that they were targeted by Kremlin- backed hackers during the 2016 election. Those states included Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington.2 Arizona, California, Iowa, Texas, and Wisconsin. Currently, hackers only reportedly succeeded in breaching the voter registration system of one state: Illinois. In the aftermath of the 2016 hacking, a growing bench of national security and cyber experts have emerged noting that Russia is just one potential threat. Other actors including North Korea, Iran, organized criminals possess, and individual hackers have motives and technical capability to infiltrate or interfere with elections and democratic operations. Leaders and experts have warned that a future attack on elections or voting infrastructure by Russian-backed hackers or others with nefarious intent, such as seen in 2016, is likely in 2018 and beyond. One recommendation to prevent disinformation from fake election-related web sites and email spoofing is for local governments to use .gov domain names for web sites and email addresses. These are controlled by the federal government, which authenticates the legitimate government controls the domain. Many local governments use .com or other top-level domain names; an attacker could easily and quickly set up an altered copy of the site on a similar-sounding .com address using a private registrar.1 Simple Step Could Help Election Security. Governments Aren't Doing It In 2018 assessment of US state election security by the Center for American Progress, no state received an “A” based on their measurements of seven election security factors. Forty states received a grade of C or below. A separate 2017 report from the Center for American Progress outlines nine solutions which states can implement to secure their elections; including requiring paper ballots or records of every vote, the replacement of outdated voting equipment, conducting post election audits, enacting cybersecurity standards for voting systems, pre-election testing of voting equipment, threat assessments, coordination of election security between state and federal agencies, and the allocating of federal funds for ensuring election security. == Europe == Russia's 2016 attempts to interfere in U.S. elections fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade. Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, France and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Kremlin-backed hackers appeared aimed at influencing election results, sowing discord and undermining trust in public institutions that include government agencies, the media and elected officials. In late 2017, the United Kingdom through its intelligence agencies made claims that a Russian IO campaign played a damaging role in its Brexit referendum vote in June 2016. == Role of white hat hackers == The \\"white hat\\" hacker community has also been involved in the public debate. From July 27–30, 2017, DEFCON – the world’s largest, longest running and best-known hacker conference – hosted a “Voting Machine Hacking Village” at its annual conference in Las Vegas, Nevada to highlight election security vulnerabilities. The event featured 25 different pieces of voting equipment used in federal, state and local U.S. elections and made them available to white-hat hackers and IT researchers for the purpose of education, experimentation, and to demonstrate the cyber vulnerabilities of such equipment. During the 3-day event, thousands of hackers, media and elected officials witnessed the hacking of every piece of equipment, with the first machine to be compromised in under 90 minutes. One voting machine was hacked remotely and was configured to play Rick Astley's song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up.\\" Additional findings of the Voting Village were published in a report issued by DEFCON in October 2017. The \\"Voting Village\\" was brought back for a second year at DEF CON, which was held in Las Vegas, August 9-12, 2018. The 2018 event dramatically expanded its inquiries to include more of the election environment, from voter registration records to election night reporting and many more of the humans and machines in the middle. DEF CON 2018 also featured a greater variety of voting machines, election officials, equipment, election system processes, and election night reporting. Voting Village participants consisted of hackers, IT and security professionals, journalists, lawyers, academics, and local, state and federal government leaders. A full report was issued on the 2018 Village Findings at a press conference in Washington, DC, held on September 27, 2018. == Legislation and policy == A variety of experts and interest groups have emerged to address U.S. voting infrastructure vulnerabilities and to support state and local elections officials in their security efforts. From these efforts have come a general set of policy ideas for election security, including: * Implement universal use of paper ballots, marked by hand and read by optical scanner, ensuring a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT). * Phase out touch-screen voting machines – especially the most vulnerable direct-recording electronic (DRE) devices * Update pollbooks and other electronic equipment used to check-in voters. * Verify voting results by requiring election officials to conduct risk-limiting audits, a statistical post-election audit before certification of final results. * Secure voting infrastructure, especially voter registration databases, using cyber hygiene tools such as the CIS “20 Critical Security Controls” or NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework. * Call upon outside experts to conduct cyber assessments – DHS, white-hat hackers, cybersecurity vendors and security researchers – where needed. * Provide resources and training to state and local election leaders for cyber maintenance and on-going monitoring. * Promote information-sharing on cyber threats and incidents in and across the entire voting industry. * Appropriate federal funding to states to implement infrastructure upgrades, audits, and cyber hygiene measures. * Establish clear channels for coordination between local, state, and federal agencies, including real-time sharing of threat and intelligence information. * Maintain DHS's designation of elections as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector. * Require DHS to institute a pre-election threat assessment plan to bolster its technical support capacity to state and locals requesting assistance. Federal legislation has also been introduced to address these concerns. The first bipartisan Congressional legislation to protect the administration of Federal elections against cybersecurity threats – the Secure Elections Act (SB 2261) – was introduced on December 21, 2017 by Senator James Lankford (R-OK). The 2018 Federal Budget (as signed by President Donald Trump) included $380m USD in state funding to improve election security. Each state received a standard payment of $3m USD, with the remaining $230m USD allocated to each state proportionally based on voting age population. Security measures funded included improving cybersecurity (36.3% of funds), the purchase of new voting equipment (27.8%), improvement of voter registration systems (13.7%), post election audits (5.6%), and improving communications efforts (2%). ==See also== Verified Voting Foundation == References  * Verified Voting - U.S. advocacy organization that catalogs voting equipment used in each state Category:Elections Category:Electoral systems Category:Electoral fraud Category:National security Category:Security technology Category:Information governance Category:Cyberwarfare Category:Cryptography Category:Cybercrime ","title":"Election security"},{"id":"56767621","text":"Dollie Lowther Robinson (died August 4, 1983) was an American politician and labor rights worker, best known for her work with labor unions. == Early life and education == An Elizabeth City N.C. native, Dollie Lowther Robinson was educated at Brooklyn College.

Numbers 1-50 were built by Robert Stephenson and Company and numbers 155-164 were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company. ==History== The two series of locomotives entered service between 1857 and 1858. In 1859, following the Second Italian War of Independence, the LVCI network was divided into a Lombard part (Lombardy was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia) and a Venetian part (Veneto remained a possession of the Austrian Empire). Locomotives 1-50 were divided into LOMB 1-35 and VEN 1-15, while 155-164 were all assigned to the Venetian part with numbers VEN 16-25. In 1865, when the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) was established, the Lombard machines were taken into the stock of this company and became SFAI 31-65. The following year, after the Third Italian War of Independence, which resulted in the annexation of the Veneto region to the Kingdom of Italy, the 25 Veneto machines also came into SFAI stock and were numbered SFAI 66-90. The SFAI scrapped 10 machines in 1874, and rebuilt another 10 with 2-4-0 wheel arrangement, giving rise to the 301-311 series. ===The great networks=== In 1885, with the creation of the great national networks, the locomotives were divided between the Adriatic Network (RA) and the Mediterranean Network (RM). The RA received 22 units, all of Robert Stephenson construction, and gave them numbers RA 31-52. The RM received all the Beyer Peacock units, which they numbered RM 501-510, and 8 Stephenson units, which they numbered RM 511-518. ===Nationalization=== In 1905, with the establishment of Italian State Railways (FS), eight units were still in operation and they were registered as FS Class 102. They comprised 4 Stephenson units, numbered 1021-1024, and 4 Beyer Peacock, numbered 1025-1028. All the locomotives were scrapped before 1910, except one which survived long enough to be shown at the Esposizione di Torino in 1911, although it was scrapped soon afterwards. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Fabio Cherubini, Le Stephenson trasformate, \\"iTreni\\", 2011, 312. * Herbert Dietrich, Die Südbahn und ihre Vorläufer, Wien, Bohmann Verlag, 1994, . * Hans PeterPawlik, Josef Otto Slezak, Südbahn-Lokomotiven, Wien, Verlag Slezak, 1987, . * P.M.

The etymology of the name is uncertain, though 'Çöp' means garbage or rubbish in modern Turkish, and may have come from the word meaning 'chaff', the stalk of wheat removed during winnowing. It has also been suggested that they are so called because the meat used is the smaller scraps of meat that are not used for other types of kebab. Çöp şiş is generally cooked on wooden skewers rather than iron ones. During preparation, the lamb meat and pieces of fat are mixed with garlic and tomato and left to marinate with black pepper, oregano and olive oil, before cooking over an ocak, or grill.

In 1940, Wright became the first African- American woman in the United States to earn her Ph.D. in history. == Early life == Marion Manola Thompson Wright was born in East Orange, New Jersey on September 12, 1902 to Minnie Thompson and Moses R. Thompson. Wright was the youngest of four children, and had two older twin sisters and a brother who passed away at a young age. Few details are available on Thompson's youth, but she attended Barringer High School in Newark, New Jersey. Even as a teenager, she expressed her frustrations with the New Jersey school system as one of two black students at her high school. == Personal life == At the age of 16, Wright married William Moss and had two children, Thelma and James. Wright made the decision to leave her children with her husband to continue to pursue her high school degree. This was due to the expectations that women were not to be accepted into higher universities if they were married or divorced. A few years later, Wright divorced from her husband, leaving her children with her mother to continue to pursue her education. Wright married Arthur M. Wright, but divorced soon after. == Education == After graduating from high school, Wright attended Howard University where she received her bachelor's degree in 1927 before earning her Master's in History and Education. After this, she attended Teachers College, Columbia University where she began her work on her dissertation. Wright completed her dissertation, \\"The Education of Negroes in New Jersey\\", which focused on the state of education for blacks and its consistent segregated and unjust schools. Wright became the first black woman in the United States to earn her Ph.D. in History in 1940. After earning her Ph.D., Wright went back to Howard where she taught. Wright began the Negro History Bulletin to educate students on their black history. In the 1950s, Wright worked with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In addition, her dissertation was incorporated into the Brown v. Board of Education argument. == Death and legacy == At the age of 60, Wright's body was found unresponsive inside her car in her garage. Wright's death certificate states that she died of cardiopulmonary failure, however some sources state that she committed suicide. Each year, Rutgers University - Newark hosts an annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series. The event is a part of the celebration of Black History Month and in February 2018, Rutgers celebrated their 38th annual lecture series. == References == Category:1902 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Created via preloaddraft Category:African-American historians Category:American women historians Category:People from East Orange, New Jersey Category:Teachers College, Columbia University alumni Category:Howard University alumni Category:Howard University faculty ","title":"Marion Thompson Wright"},{"id":"56767776","text":"Jack Nagel (January 30, 1926 - March 11, 2004) was an American alpine skier.

It was composed between 1957 and 1958. == Composition == The sonata was commissioned by Paul Sacher for his own orchestra, the Collegium Musicum Zürich, together with his Double Concerto for Oboe, Harp and Strings, and was written between 1957 and early 1958. According to Henze, it was influenced by an earlier idea of Heinz von Cramer, the librettist of Henze's König Hirsch, for a ballet about the Embarquement pour Cythère. It was premiered by Paul Sacher in Zurich on March 21, 1958. It was dedicated to Paul Sacher and his wife, Maya Sacher and was later published by Boosey & Hawkes. == Structure == The sonata is in two movements and has a total duration of 15 minutes. The movement list is as follows: * 1. Allegro * 2. 32 Variations ** Thema. Mosso ** Variation I. Adagio ** Variation II. Più mosso ** Variation III. Lo stesso tempo ** Variation IV. Molto calmo ** Variation V. Lo stesso tempo, con tenerezza ** Variation VI. Assai mosso, con vigore ** Variation VII. Meno mosso, leggiero ** Variation VIII. Ancora meno ** Variation IX. Con moto ** Variation X. Più mosso ** Variation XI. Molto più mosso, appassionato ** Variation XII. Mesto ** Variation XIII. Un poco più mosso ** Variation XIV. Lo stesso tempo (estremamente piano) ** Variation XV. Ancora calmo ** Variation XVI. Con fuoco ** Variation XVII. Veloce ** Variation XVIII. Lo stesso tempo ** Variation XIX. Lo stesso tempo ** Variation XX. Ritardando ** Variation XXI. Di nuovo assai mosso ** Variation XXII. Di più ** Variation XXIII. Leggiero ** Variation XXIV. Meno mosso ** Variation XXV. Furioso ** Variation XXVI. Molto più lento ** Variation XXVII. Molto meno mosso ancora ** Variation XXVIII. Subito più mosso ** Variation XXIX. Sostenuto ** Variation XXX. Grave (Lamentandosi) ** Variation XXXI. ♩. = 76 ** Variation XXXII. ♩ = 60 Its structure is nothing like a traditional sonata and displays the composer's distinctive serialist style. The first movement consists of a five- minute Stravinskian toccata, with plenty neo-classical features. It starts in E minor, but modulates in minor-third oscillations. The second movement is presumably influenced by Beethoven and consists of a set of attacca variations which are very difficult to distinguish by ear. It is scored for eight first violins, six second violins, four violas , four celli and two double basses. == Notable recordings == * Paul Sacher conducted the Collegium Musicum Zürich in August 1967. The recording was released by Deutsche Grammophon both in LP and CD format. == References == Category:Compositions for string orchestra Category:Compositions by Hans Werner Henze Category:1958 compositions Category:Serialism ","title":"Sonata per archi"},{"id":"56767925","text":"Seattle Bible College (SBC) is a four-year Bible college in Everett, Washington that offers theological and church ministry degrees.

Against the wishes of her family she decided that she wanted to go on the stage, and in 1858 she began taking private acting lessons from Jan Królikowski, in the same year becoming a student at Józef Rychter's School of Drama in Warsaw. She made her stage début aged 17, while still a student, as Fredericka Wagner in Émile Augier and Jules Sandeau's comedy Touchstone at the Rozmaitości Theatre in 1859. In 1860 she moved to Kraków where she was hired by Józef Pfeiffer, director of the Municipal Theatre in Kraków and went on to make many appearances with that company in performances at Lviv, Poznań, Prague and Warsaw. She was a co-worker and lifelong companion of Stanisław Egbert Koźmian (this relationship lasted until her death, but it was not legalized) and became an exponent of his 'Kraków School' of acting, which involved a deeper analysis of the text of the play. She competed successfully for the position of the leading actress in the group of the Kraków theatre with Helena Modjeska. ==Career== Antonina Hoffman by Tadeusz Ajdukiewicz (1883) Apart from a few short interludes Hoffmann worked exclusively in Kraków until 1893, at first under Pfeiffer's direction and later under that of Adam Miłaszewski (1863-1865), whose period as director ended in fiasco and in the breaking up of the entire company. This resulted in something of a low point in Hoffmann's career when she accepted a wide variety of roles including tragic heroines and comedy parts, leading ladies and character roles. A falling out with Miłaszewski caused her to depart from the Kraków theatre and by 1865 she had joined Konstanty Sulikowski's company in Tarnow. However, in 1865, Adam Skorupka became head of the Municipal Theatre in Kraków and Koźmian began collaborating with him. Hoffmann returned and was cast in the theatre's productions, performing with the company in Kraków and during guest appearances in Poznań, Krynica, Kielce, Tarnow and Prague. During this period she travelled to Vienna and Paris to observe theatre there. ==Later years and death== During her later years her career diminished while at the same time fighting against the cancer which was to kill her. Hoffmann died in Kraków on her 55th birthday. She was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery in the family grave of her friend Helena Modjeska and Wendów.Funeral of the late Antonina Hoffmann, Time 1897 No. 138 of June 20 p.3 (Polish) In November that year her body was moved to its own grave, 'Chronicle of Antonina Hoffmann' - Lviv Courier 1897 nr 311 s.3 - National Library of Austria which is decorated with a sculpture-bust of the artist by Michał Korpal and an epitaph which states that she devoted 37 years to the Kraków stage. ==Roles== In total, she played nearly 400 theatre roles; among these was Elizabeth in Friedrich Schiller's Don Carlos and Lady Milford in the same author's Love and Intrigue, Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing, Catherine in Taming of the Shrew, Gertrude in Hamlet, Lady Macbeth in Macbeth and Desdemona in Othello. She also appeared in the title role in Jean Racine's tragedy Phèdre, played Suzanne in Pierre Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro and Camilla in Alfred de Musset's No Trifling with Love. She was responsible for introducing the dramas of Juliusz Słowacki to the Kraków stage. She played a number of roles from the Polish repertoire, including Clara in Aleksander Fredro's Śluby panieńskie (Maidens' Vows) and Gulda in Joseph Conrad's Cyganie (The Gypsies). She also appeared in contemporary French dramas, playing, among others, Joanna de Simerose in L'ami des Femmes and Severine in Princess George by Alexander Dumas, Princess Falconieri in Octave Feuillet's Dalila and the title role in Victorien Sardou's Odette. ==References== Category:1842 births Category:1897 deaths Category:Polish stage actresses Category:19th-century Polish actresses Category:People from Chrzanów County Category:Actresses from Kraków Category:Burials at Rakowicki Cemetery ","title":"Antonina Hoffmann"},{"id":"56768203","text":"The 1982 Scheldeprijs was the 69th edition of the Scheldeprijs cycle race and was held on 27 July 1982.

This movie is the sequel of The Mountain, which was released in 2012. The film was screened at cinema on November 4, 2016. == Plot == Ceyda, a journalist is abducted by ISIS terrorists while she is covering a story on Yezidi people and their story of long-suffering and abandonment. A Turkish special force team of seven headed by Commander Veysel flies out to rescue her. We see the events through the eyes of Oğuz as the film begins in medias res. His flashbacks show us the life and memories of these men up until they came to the rescue mission. Oğuz and Bekir are best of friends and was saved by two Special Force commandos who laid their lives on the line for Oğuz and Bekir which is a determining factor in their joining the force. Ceyda is secured from her ISIS captors seconds before death by the Special forces team after which they start moving along to the mountain to the LZ (landing zone), from where they will be airlifted. On their way, they encounter a group of rebels who are torturing the Yezidis and Iraqi Turks, they rescue a girl child in her teens and a woman being tortured by ISIS terrorists. They continue on their journey to the LZ (landing zone) and upon reaching the last village near the LZ, they find out that the village would be attacked by a battalion of ISIS terrorists the next morning. Instead of abandoning the defenceless villagers to the invaders, and leaving when the air support reaches out to them, the commander sends the children of the village along with Ceyda to safety. Meanwhile, Commander Veysel and his six men stay back in the village to face hundreds of terrorists with their limited resources. After securing the villagers in a coal house, they hoist the flag of Turkey over the building. The special forces team with their advanced abilities and peculiar set of skills, manage to bring the terrorist battalion down despite their lack of numbers. However, the strength of the team reduces to four with the deaths of the Commander himself, Mustafa and Ęsref. The commander before dying, orders his men to ask evacuation of all the villagers from the HQ and they call it in. == Cast == {  width=\\"50%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" ! Actor !!

From the start, the union admitted women as members, and about half the women working in cutlery manufacture in Sheffield were said to be members by 1920. However, women were not initially eligible for the union's sickness benefits. In 1957, the union merged into the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. By this time, the union had about 900 members. The union's secretary and treasurer was Harold Slack, who also served as a Labour Party member of Sheffield City Council. He was considered for membership of the Design Council, but was ultimately not appointed.

She is currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. JB sees her music as a way of capturing oral history and often writes lyrics about challenging subjects such as the Canadian Indian residential school system and missing and murdered Indigenous women. She sees hip-hop as a tool of Indigenous empowerment and is a prominent voice for decolonization and for inspiring Indigenous women and youth. == Early life == Webster was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan on March 12, 1984. She spent her childhood moving around Canada, and by the time she was a teenager she had lived in many different cities and communities across the country. Webster moved to Vancouver in the early 2000s where she attended her first hip-hop show by Tribal Wisdom, a group of young Indigenous rappers. The show was a pivotal moment for Webster in her journey as a hip-hop artist that inspired her to create music that would empower other young people. In an interview with CBC Music in 2014, she said: \\"When I went to this hip-hop show, I saw Kinnie Starr and Skeena Reece, Ostwelve, Manik1derful, and they just had so much pride about who they were and where they came from. I wanted to encourage other young people to stand up for the injustices in Canada pertaining to land, water, Aboriginal rights.\\" Webster then began spending time at the Knowledgeable Aboriginal Youth Association (KAYA) in Vancouver where she had free access to a recording studio and began putting out mixtapes. She began working at KAYA and became executive director of the organization at age 22. == Career == In 2006, Webster helped found the First Ladies Crew, an Indigenous women's rap and hip-hop collective based out of East Vancouver that features Rapsure Risin, Dani and Lizzy, Christie Lee Charles, and Mama Es. The First Ladies Crew uses hip-hop as a platform to empower young Indigenous women and bring light to oral histories and questions of identity. \\"Our ancestors, the matriarchs, were the speakers, the keepers of ceremony, and our oral history,\\" said Webster. \\"As a young person, an activist talking about women’s rights or about murdered and missing Indigenous women, hip-hop has been the best venue to connect with not only my peers and young people, but also the greater public that may have barriers to listening to the stories of First Nations and Indigenous people.\\" With four solo and one collaborative album out, Webster is a strong, consistent voice in Indigenous hip-hop and activism. She is well known for her involvement in the Idle No More movement and for emceeing rallies for Indigenous rights, decolonization, environmental justice, and the issue of violence against Indigenous women. In February 2017, Webster was a panelist for a national forum on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Girls hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti for CBC's The Current. Webster has performed, spoken, and facilitated music events at hundreds of venues across Canada, including youth and community centers in Indigenous communities, at political rallies, and in schools. Since the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report, Webster has also regularly spoken about Indigenous knowledge and histories with immigrant, refugee, and non- Indigenous communities and groups such as the B.C. Nurses' Union and the Hospital Employees’ Union. Despite national recognition, Webster maintains a strong focus on supporting and giving back to the youth in her community. == Awards & nominations == * #35, 100 Best Canadian Songs of 2017, CBC Music (2017) * Commemorative Medal, Queens Golden Jubilee * Emerging Community Engaged Artist, Mayor Arts Award, Vancouver (2016) * Best Cover Album, Indigenous Music Award (2015) * Nomination, Best New Album, Aboriginal Peoples Choice Award (2012) * Nomination, Female Entertainer of the Year, Aboriginal Peoples Choice Award (2011) * Nomination, Best New Hip-Hop Album, Aboriginal Peoples Choice Award (2011) == Discography  Solo albums === * Indigenous Love (2008, self-released) * Get Ready Get Steady (2011, self-released) * Indigenous Girl Lifestyle (2014, self-released) * Meant To Be (2017, self- released) === Collaborations === * Indigenized by Enter-Tribal, in collaboration with Chief Rock (2015) === Singles === * \\"Get Ready Get Steady\\" (2011) * \\"OOTG\\" (2017) * \\"Still Here\\" (2018) == References == Category:Created via preloaddraft Category:21st-century Canadian rappers Category:Living people Category:Idle No More Category:First Nations musicians Category:1984 births Category:21st-century women musicians Category:Canadian female rappers Category:People from Moose Jaw Category:Musicians from Saskatchewan ","title":"JB the First Lady"},{"id":"56768470","text":"The 2018 German Darts Masters was the second staging of the tournament by the Professional Darts Corporation, and was the first entry in the 2018 World Series of Darts.

At the end of the Cold War and the space race, a new rationale was made on the pragmatic use of space for improving life on Earth, with notable utilities such as satellite telecommunications, remote sensing, microgravity research and satellite navigation. Government, space programs began investing in practical outcomes for the public good. Therefore, the importance of measuring the socio-economic benefits of space activities steadily grew throughout the 1970s and 1980s, an era defined as \\"Mission to Planet Earth\\". These benefits continue into today's society as the privatization of space travel and space exploration continues to show scientific and socio-economic benefits to those around them. == Direct benefits == Space programs that have made their way into a myriad of applications. The benefits of these applications are directly to the original investments made by the space agencies and the private sector. Space exploration alone has provided a significant amount of knowledge that is important for the education of people about finally understanding of our planet and the universe. Some of the more direct benefits of space exploration include an increase in the knowledge that is out there about space and the discovery of distant planets and galaxies, it also gives us insight into the beginnings of our universe. === Knowledge of space === Since Sputnik 1 entered orbit in 1957 to perform Ionospheric experiments, the human understanding of earth and space has increased. The list of missions to the moon begin as early as 1958 and continued into the current age. A few successful lunar missions, by the USSR, include missions such as, the Luna 1 spacecraft that completed the first flyby of the moon in 1959, the Luna 3 lunar probe that took the first pictures of the far side of the moon in 1959, the Luna 10 orbiter that was the first orbiter of the moon in 1966, and the Lunokhod 1 lunar rover in 1970, which was the first rover that explored the surface of a world beyond earth. The United States also added significant lunar first, such as Apollo 8 in 1968 is the first successful human mission to orbit the moon and the historic Apollo 11 when man first landed on the moon. Missions to the moon have collected samples of lunar materials and there are now multiple satellites such as ARTEMIS P1 that currently orbit the moon and collect data. Telescopic satellites have captured millions of images of the universe since the introduction of satellites, such as the Mariner Space Satellites. The Mariner 4 space satellite in 1965 was the first successful satellite to capture up-close images of the planet Mars. Mariner missions 6 and 7 additionally mapped the poles of the Red planet and relayed further images of the surface. By the end of the Mariner missions in 1972,Mariner 9 spent almost a year in the Martian orbit (687 days), collected images of nearly 100% of the surface of the moon, and observed notable discoveries including the humongous Olympus Mons volcano, more than 4000 km of Valles Marineris, and dust storms lasting over a month. Further missions since 1972, like the Viking project, Mars observer, Mars pathfinder, Mars climate orbiter, Deep Space 2, Mars Global surveyor, and Phoenix, have obtained understandings of the climate, flood plains, and rock samples on Mars. Hubble Deep Field The Hubble Space Telescope has contributed more than 2 million observations of the universe that have been influential in understanding the magnitude of the universe since its introduction into orbit. The intense focus of Hubble is for observation. The Hubble has been used to discover galaxies and planets across the universe. It was pointed at a speck of black space for ten consecutive days and the resultant image, the Hubble Deep Field, revealed at least 1,500 galaxies in that small location in the sky. Views like this allow the realization of the size and scope of the larger universal understanding of the types and variances of galaxies out in space. The Hubble Space Telescope has cost about $12 billion in the last 30 years including the cost of five shuttle servicing missions, the information received by the astronomers monitoring the Hubble provides a better understanding that would not be possible on from earth telescopes. == Indirect benefits  Culture and inspiration === Published by NASA in March 2019, the \\"Jupiter Marble\\" by the Juno probe Human culture exists as a social environment made up by traditions, norms, rules written or unwritten, and social practices. Cultures can be specific to groups of any size such as a family or group of friends but also as large as a state or nation. The range and diversity of human culture is markedly large. International collaboration in the space age brought together different cultures and as a result, the exchange and advancement of human culture. In over fifty years of space travel, the diversity of those working in space and in the field as a whole has dramatically increased from the beginnings of space exploration. This progression in diversity brought more cultures into close quarters and resulted in the enrichment of human culture globally. A testament to space exploration facilitating cross-cultural growth, the International Space Station exhibits an important collaboration between nations to construct and continually man the station. The ISS operates as a research facility that contributes cutting edge scientific work from a unique environment that is nearly impossible to recreate on earth. The innovation and exploration of the space age has served as an inspiration to humankind. Breaking through into space travel, man leaving earth and defeating gravity, taking steps on the moon, and various other achievements were pivotal moments in human cultural development. In particular, the scientific and technological advancements stand as an inspiration to the scientific community of students, teachers, and researchers worldwide. Moreover, space exploration has also inspired innovative training programs aimed at preschoolers, such as the Future Astronauts Program. It is evident that by drawing in the wonder of space together with the knowledge and skills developed through space exploration into classrooms, children can be strongly motivated and empowered from a young age. Space exploration has nearly no limit to how far humankind can adventure as our technology advances. Space exploration will continue to foster international inspiration and collaboration, and pose revolutionary philosophical, political, and scientific questions and debates. === Global partnerships === The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station assembled in low earth orbit largely by the United States and Russia, with assistance and components from a multinational consortium. In 1993, the United States and Russia agreed to merge their separate space station plans into a single facility integrating their respective modules and incorporating contributions from the European Space Agency and Japan. Collaborations among the international community have provided the ability to test things in space and see how objects and people react to space for extended periods of time. Work on the sustainability of long term space flights and the possibilities of interplanetary spaceflights have been major objectives of the ISS. These partnerships benefit all nations, even those outside the industrialized world. Some African countries, including Nigeria and South Africa, have successfully employed space technology—specifically satellite-based disaster management, climate monitoring, and green systems—to tackle workforce development issues and launch new space activities. Space is a place where different religions can come together. Evangelical Christians are the least knowledgeable and supportive of space travel, while Eastern religions are the most knowledgeable and supportive. Studies show that Evangelical Christians and Eastern Religions are both equally as optimistic about space. Even though these two religions are different, they both come together in their optimism about space. === Spinoffs === thumb NASA reports that 444,000 lives have been saved, 14,000 jobs have been created, 5 billion dollars in revenue has been generated, and there has been 6.2 billion dollars in cost reduction due to spin-off programs from NASA research in collaboration with various companies.NASA. Spinoff. 2012, https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2012/pdf/Spinoff2012.pdf. Of the many beneficial NASA spinoff technologies there has been advancements in the fields of health and medicine, transportation, public safety, consumer goods, energy and environment, information technology, and industrial productivity. Multiple products and innovations used in the daily life are results of space generated research. Solar panels, water-purification systems, dietary formulas and supplements, space suit materials in clothing, and global search and rescue systems are but a few examples of the beneficiary spinoffs that have been produced. === International Space Station === The ISS The unifying efforts to create the International Space Station took form in December of 1998 as the space shuttle Endeavor launched from the Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 18 nations took some part in the development and construction of space station and the five notable agencies that encompassed these 18 nations were NASA, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space agency and the National Space Development Agency of Japan. The International Space Station serves as a depot of collaboration across the world for innovative research, human health research, global education and earth observation. The International Space Station itself contains complex sensors including light detection and ranging systems which help in our understanding of sea surface winds and atmospheric transportation patterns. Additional astronaut observation from the station with powerful cameras provides detailed images of the earth and panoramic views of the atmosphere of the earth. Data collected from the space station complex orbital sensor system have been a valuable tool in evaluating the extent of damage resulting from natural disaster. Real-time mapping coupled with a human crew allows for space to ground collaboration. === Communications === The first passive communication satellite was actually a balloon called Echo 1 inflated in orbit. It was launched on August 12, 1960, and stayed roughly 1000 miles (1,600 km) above the Earth until May 24, 1968. The first satellite that would be an actual communication satellite by modern standards was launched on July 10, 1962, and it was named Telstar. It allowed communication between the United States and Europe to occur almost instantaneously. Telstar operated for approximately a year before it shut down, but even with its rather short lifespan, it proved that long distance communication by satellite was possible. Now, far more sophisticated communications satellites can be used to communicate in remote areas with the use of satellite phones, to provide internet service on airline flights, and provide internet to areas that are unable to get internet in any other way. The number of communication satellites has since expanded to about 2,000 which are able to provide continuous communication around the globe. === Weather satellites === The first weather satellite named TIROS I (Television and Infrared Observation Satellite) was launched on April 1, 1960. The satellite used television cameras to take pictures of clouds as it orbited the Earth. TIROS I only operated for 78 days, however during that time it was able to prove that using a satellite to observe weather conditions on Earth was not only possible, but that it could greatly increase the amount of data available to meteorologists with the result was that more accurate weather forecasts were possible. The use of satellites has since come a long way. The number of weather satellites has increased significantly, and the satellites themselves are now more sophisticated. In addition to taking pictures of clouds they can now observe weather patterns in the same area 24/7 because they are in geostationary orbit, meaning that they move at the same speed as the Earth's rotation and thus they always see the same area. Even when it is dark in the part of the world that they are observing they can see through the use of infrared technology. This allows meteorologists to monitor the development of weather in areas that are not covered by traditional means like Doppler radar, such as over the ocean, which, in turn, allows them to give advanced warnings for severe weather such as hurricanes thus saving lives. Weather satellites can also be used to observe the amount of ice at the poles, and where that ice may go if it breaks off. Also, the satellites are used to take pictures of the snow coverage in an area which can help determine the amount of water that will run off when the snow eventually melts. They are even being used to predict the amount of power that solar panels can make in certain areas by monitoring the cloud cover and weather patterns at the proposed solar panel site. === Biomedical research === thumb Beginning in 1967, NASA successfully began its Biosatellite program that initially took frog eggs, amoeba, bacteria, plants and mice and studied the effects of zero gravity on these biological life forms. Studies of human life in space have augmented the understanding of the effects of adjusting to a space environment, such as alterations in body fluids, negative influences on the immune system and effects of space on sleep patterns. Current space research pursuits are divided into the subjects of Space Biology, which studies the effects of space on smaller organisms such as cells, Space Physiology, which is the study of the effects of space on the human body and Space Medicine, which examines the possible dangers of space on the human body. Discoveries concerning the human body and space, particularly the effects on the development of bones, may provide further understanding of biomineralization and the process of gene transcription. ==See also== * NASA spinoff technologies ==References== Category:Space exploration ","title":"Benefits of space exploration"},{"id":"56768580","text":"Vimal Sood (born 1922) was the first woman to become a dentist in India.

After the death of his brother, Isaiah Reid took on John Burn Harrison as a partner, then proved insolvent 1866. In 1868, which may have been Reid's last year of operation, their production was of beer. This made the Morphett Street Brewery the smallest in the city; one third that of Simms & Chapman's West End Brewery and half that of Syme & Sison's Pirie Street Brewery. Their pale ale was bottled partly by Noltenius and partly by Aldridge. The factory was then taken over by Fred Fuller & Co. who continued operating on the premises until perhaps as late as 1873. Isaiah Reid later conducted a brewery at Port Augusta. Frederick Robinson Fuller (died 1883) proved insolvent in 1871. == References == Category:Australian companies established in 1859 Category:1873 disestablishments in Australia Category:Beer brewing companies based in South Australia Category:Breweries in Australia Category:Food and drink companies established in 1859 ","title":"Morphett Street Brewery"},{"id":"56768644","text":"The Planica7 (2018) was the first edition of Planica7, a four-day tournament for men in ski flying, held between 22–25 March 2018 in Planica, Slovenia.

There is good anchorage in the bay, with a depth of 7 fathoms. It is well protected, except from winds from the south. ==Settlements== Ardtornish Bay is part of Ardtornish Estate. Ardtornish House is famous for its gardens and the estate is the location of the ruined Ardtornish Castle and the still- inhabited Kinlochaline Castle. Lochaline is the largest settlement in the area, and the main village in the Morvern area, along the A884 road. Fort William is the nearest transport hub. ==Geography== Inninbeg House, Ardtornish Bay Ardtornish Bay faces the Sound of Mull in a southerly direction, the Sound that runs from Aulston Point and Tobermory in the North to the Rubha Fiart and Duart Point on the Isle of Mull, in the southeast. The small islands of Eilean Rubha an Ridere, that is opposite Inninmore Bay, and Eileanan Glas in the middle of the Sound and Sgeir nan Gobhar off the coast of Mull, can be seen from the bay. At the west end of the bay, is Artornish Point, is a small promontory, that is rendered remarkable by the ruins of an ancient castle, celebrated by Sir Walter Scott in one of his poems. The ruins are now inconsiderable, consisting principally of the keep, with traces of outer defences, but of its ancient strength and splendour, no remains can be traced, in the crumbling walls of a small and apparently insignificant building. Within the castle a quarter of a mile, on somewhat higher ground, is Ardtornish house with stables and offices. To the east of the bay, running in the southeast direction is Aoineadh Beag, the dramatic cliffs of Ardtornish Bay. The cliffs rise to be 300metres before a gentle incline up to the hilltop of Glais Bheinn at 479metres. To the north is the narrow opening of Coalas na h-Àirde into Loch Aline. An Sleaghach at 515m, is the largest peak in the area, in the west about 4.5 miles to the west, but is not visible from the bay, due to the height of the Aoineadh Beag cliffs. ==References== Category:Bays of Lochaber ","title":"Ardtornish Bay"},{"id":"56768650","text":"Gobio kubanicus is a species of gudgeon, a small freshwater in the family Cyprinidae.

Her wreck was found in 2006, and on October 14, 2009, the wreck of the Wallace was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The Robert Wallace in dry dock The Robert Wallace (Official number 110518) was built in 1882 by William H. Radcliffe of Cleveland, Ohio, for David Wallace of Lorain, Ohio. Her homeport was Lorain. She had a length of , a beam of , and she had a depth. She was powered by a small 550 horsepower compound steam engine and fueled by a single coal-fired Scotch marine boiler. She had a gross tonnage of 1189.56 tons and a net tonnage of 905.38 tons. She was launched at 2:30P.M. on April 13, 1882. She usually carried bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal and grain. On August 2, 1883, the Wallace was towing the schooner barge J.M. Hill when she and the Hill were struck by lightning in the Milwaukee harbor. Both the Wallace and the Hill had their foremasts heavily damaged. On November 18, 1886, the Wallace was towing her schooner barge David Wallace (which was named after Robert Wallace's brother) when she stranded near Marquette, Michigan. The Robert Wallace eventually caught fire and burned down. This incident almost ended her career but she was pulled off and repaired. On November 12, 1891, the Wallace ran aground because of low water in the Sheboygan Harbor. She was loaded with a cargo of coal at the time of the incident. She was also towing the David Wallace which was carrying 1,500 tons of coal and also ran aground. On October 22, 1896, the boilers of the Wallace started to leak and they needed to be repaired so that she could continue her journey. She was repaired in Harbor Beach, Michigan. ==Sinking== On November 17, 1902, the Wallace departed the ore docks in Superior, Wisconsin laden with a cargo of iron ore. She was also towing the schooner barge Ashland, which was also full of iron ore. About four hours after their departure the Wallace's stern pipe burst which caused a leak and started sinking her. Her crew was transferred to the Ashland which then sailed to Two Harbors, Minnesota, and was towed to safety by the steel hulled tug Edna G. Even though the Wallace was loaded with iron she sank quite slowly. Hours after her crew abandoned her, the Wallace continued to float on the surface of Lake Superior with her lights still on. Even when she sank her pilothouse broke off and continued to float on the surface. ==Discovery== The remains of the Wallace remained undiscovered until 2006 when an unidentified diver discovered the wreck near the shipping lanes. The diver reported the location of her wreck to diver Jay Hanson, who conducted a dive with wreck hunter Ken Merryman in 2006; in 2007 Hanson and Merryman captured video footage of the wreck. Later, Merryman and diver Bob Olson identified her wreck after seeing her name, still painted in white lettering on her stern. ==The Robert Wallace today== The wreck of the Wallace rests relatively intact in of water about south of Knife River, Minnesota. Close by are the wrecks of several ships including the wreck of the iron hulled steamer Onoko, the steel hulled package freighter Benjamin Noble, and the wooden hulled rafting tug Niagara, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The wreck of the Wallace is the most intact known wooden hulled bulk freighter in Minnesota waters. Her hull is separated about at the stem, which makes exploring her wreck easier. Her hull separated at the stem either when she hit the bottom or when the iron ore crashed into her bow, breaking it in two.

In 1902, Dack was elected as a checkweighman, and the following year, he was elected to the executive committee of the Cleveland Miners' and Quarrymen's Association. In 1911, he became the president and full-time agent of the union. He represented the union on various bodies, including serving on the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, attending the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party conferences, and three international conferences of miners: in Brussels in 1910, Carlsbad in 1913, and Prague in 1925. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, Dack stood as the Labour Party candidate for Cleveland, taking a close second place, with 35.3% of the vote. He stood again in 1922, but dropped back to third, with 29.5% of the votes cast. He continued political activity at a more local level, serving on both North Riding County Council and the Guisborough Board of Guardians from 1924. From 1930, he instead served on the county council as an alderman, and during the 1930s chaired the council's Agricultural Wages Committee and Public Assistance Committee.

In 2014, Bowling published her \\"Jam Transcription\\" of Phish's famous rendition of \\"Tweezer\\" from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013. The success of Bowling's \\"Tahoe Tweezer\\"\\"Tahoe Tweezer\\" ignited her career as a musician. Her first solo tour began in July 2015. She has released two albums inspired by the music of Phish and the Grateful Dead and is now a well respected and established musician in the psychedelic rock and jamband music scene. Bowling is a frequent guest member of Everyone Orchestra, Phil Lesh & Friends, as well as being a part of Warren Haynes' Christmas Jam for the last two consecutive years. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Blue Note Jazz Club, The Massry Center, Lockn' Music Festival, Jam Cruise & The Peach Festival. She was named by Rolling Stone in November 2016 as one of \\"Ten New Artists You Need To Know Right Now.\\" ==Early life== Bowling began playing piano at age 5 under the Suzuki Methodology.http://underthescales.com/episode-019-holly-bowling-part-1/ In 1999, Bowling won the Norbert Mueller Concerto Competition for her performance of Vivace a Concerto for Piano in D Major. by J. Haydn. Bowling earned a Bachelor of Music in Piano Performance from San Francisco State University. While there, Bowling studied under William Corbett Jones. She won both the Ross McKee award and the 2007 Michael Avalos award, the two most coveted prizes in the SFSU Piano Department. Bowling transitioned from her job as a Suzuki Piano instructor for kids into fully dedicating herself to playing live shows in 2015.https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/09/02/turning-phish- into-solo-piano-and-holly-bowlings-devotion-to-a-dream/ As of 2017, she has attended over 300 Phish shows during the 2.0 and 3.0 era. She currently resides in San Francisco, California with her husband, Jeffery Bowling, and their dog. ==Career== Bowling's first live performance was in a San Francisco bar during Phish's 2014 Bill Graham Civic Center run. The Tahoe Tweezer (Phish 7/31/13) published on October 28, 2014, has received over 95k views on YouTube. On August 10, 2015, Bowling released her first album \\"Distillation of a Dream: The Music of Phish Reimagined for Solo Piano,\\" a 14 song, 2 LP set. The 1st LP is recreations of Phish studio performances and the 2nd LP is a composed of live Phish Jam Transcriptions. The \\"Distillation of a Dream\\" project took 9 months of development. Peter Smolin, of Hornblower Records, helped Bowling launch a Pledge Music campaign to raise $12,000 for funds to cover recording costs, marketing, and royalties which successfully raised $16,500. A portion of album sales went to The Mockingbird Foundation. There are two approaches Bowling utilizes to adapt a full band's arrangement into a solo composition for the piano. “Jam Teases” are created by transcribing a small section of a song’s jam made famous by Phish or the Grateful Dead. More than 40 songs have now been transcribed as \\"Jam-Teases.\\" One example is the \\"Beautiful Jam,\\" played by the Grateful Dead within a “Dark Star” > “Wharf Rat” > “Dark Star” sequence at The Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York on 2/18/71. In a “Jam Transcription,” Bowling takes the full live version of a song and transcribes it note for note. To date, she has created four “Jam Transcriptions”: Phish’s \\"A Song I Heard The Ocean Sing,\\" from SPAC in Saratoga Springs, NY on 6/19/04, \\"The Wedge,\\" from Northerly Island in Chicago on 7/20/14, \\"Twist,\\" from Glens Falls Civic Center in Glens Falls, NY on 10/23/13; and the Grateful Dead’s \\"Eyes of the World,\\" from Freedom Hall in Louisville, KY on 6/18/74.https://www.jambase.com/article/songs-of-their-own- holly-bowling-eyes-of-the-world In 2015, Jambase included Bowling in their \\"Songs of Their Own\\" video series featuring her rendition of \\"Eyes of the World,\\" from Freedom Hall on 6/18/74. In 2016, Bowling released her second album, Better Left Unsung, which is a collection of classical solo piano arrangements of the Grateful Dead. The album release party for Better Left Unsung was held on December 7, 2016, at Phil Lesh’s Terrapin Crossroads. The album was released on December 9, 2016. The night of the album release, Bowling performed with Bob Weir at the Orange Peel in Asheville, North Carolina. Better Left Unsung reached its peak position on the Billboard Classical Albums charts at #25. On January 22, 2017, during her solo tour, Bowling performed an original composition, \\"Evolution,\\" for the first time. Currently, Bowling has four original compositions in playing rotation on solo tours entitled: \\"Proxima B,\\" \\"You Are Not Are You,\\" \\"Rocket’s Theme,\\" and \\"Evolution.\\" In 2018, Bowling's focus shifted from her solo touring career to the formation of a band. The new five-piece band, Ghost Light, began touring in the spring and is currently finalizing their first album.. Ghost Light released their first album \\"Best Kept Secrets\\" on 3/22/2019https://music.apple.com/us/album/best-kept-secrets/1452494072 ==Ghost Light== In early 2018, Bowling, guitarist Tom Hamilton (American Babies/Joe Russo’s Almost Dead), guitarist Raina Mullen (American Babies), bassist Steve Lyons (Nicos Gun), and drummer Scotty Zwang (Dopapod/RAQ) announced they were forming Ghost Light. This improvisational rock jamband is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the hometown of Hamilton, Mullen, Lyons and Zwang. Ghost Light began with laying down its foundation in the studio, often working in five-day blocks to develop its improvisational, collaborative material prior to taking it out on the road for a live audience. They originally assembled for a session at a recording studio in Hamilton, Mullen, Lyons and Zwang’s hometown of Philadelphia. Ghost Light’s aim was to “come to the project with fresh ears and no pre-conceived notions.” The quintet developed songs and a musical communication, which then led to a bond and trust between the musicians. Ghost Light's inaugural tour commenced with a sold out show on March 20, 2018, at Winstons in San Diego, CA. The first half of 2018, will see the band playing well known venues in major markets coast to coast, followed by heavy rotation on the festival circuit including the Peach Music Festival, Lockn’ Festival, Beanstalk Music Festival, Disc Jam, High Sierra Music Festival, and The Werk Out with more to be announced. During the west coast leg of the tour, the band debuted playing an acoustic set as well as special guest, Grahame Lesh, joining them for a song on both nights at Terrapin Crossroads. Along with band originals, the live shows have also featured songs of Grateful Dead, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Van Halen, Derek & the Dominos, Tears for Fears, Bruce Cockburn, and Father John Misty. The debut record will be released in the second half of the year and will be supported by an extensive tour. ==Equipment== Yamaha CP4, Nord Electro 4 & 5 ==First introductions and early shows2013=== The Chapel with Marco Benevento a benefit for Bread & Roses (special invite with donation up on stage by Marco Benevento) 12/1/13 Marco Benevento at The Highline Ballroom post Phish MSG show 12/30/13 ===2014=== Distillation of a Dream: Tahoe Tweezer in 88 Keys - 10/27/14 - Noir Lounge in San Francisco, CA.

She married René Allendy, a homeopathic doctor on November 19, 1912. == Career == In 1922, she and her husband set up the Groupe d'études philosophiques et scientifiques pour l'examen des idées nouvelles, at the Sorbonne. Yvonne was the primary benefactor of the Théatre Alfred Jarry, set up by Antonin Artaud, Roger Vitrac and Robert Aron in 1926. She co-wrote Capitalisme et Sexualité (Capitalism and sexuality; 1931) with her husband. Using the pseudonym of Jacques Poisson, she published several articles discussing the relationship between art and psychoanalysis. In \\"Littérature moderne et psychoanalysis\\" she analysed various avant-garde examples of art and literature encompassing the work of Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Cocteau, Philippe Soupault and Blaise Cendrars. She was greatly interested in cinema, stating this new field should be concern to researchers of the unconscious psychic apparatus, which also dominates drama. She claimed that the cinema introduced the means to clearly reproduce the thought-images in a way that matched their rapidity. == Later Life == Yvonne Allendy died prematurely on 23 Aug 1935, at the age of 44.

It is used by NAS Whidbey Island as their principal training grounds for testing EA-18G Growler aircraft and for drone testing. It is located about south of the Yakima Training Center, which is used by Joint Base Lewis-McChord for training exercises and about west of the now closed Umatilla Chemical Depot. The range was established by the U.S. Army Air Force in 1941 as the Arlington Bombing Range, being originally named after Arlington to the west. The range is used frequently throughout the year. Beyond its primary operator at NAS Whidbey Island, the installation is also used by Oregon National Guard units based in Pendleton and Klamath Falls. About half of the original property was distributed to non-military operators when the Air Force transferred the site to the Navy. The range is also an important ecological site, with parts of it being federally protected. ==Geography== The range lies south of Interstate 84 within the Columbia Basin, which is in the rain shadow of the Cascade mountains. Its location in eastern Oregon makes it drier than areas to the west of the mountain range. The area has low vegetation, such as sagebrush and gradually climbs from near the Columbia River in the north to hills in the south which reach an elevation of above sea level. The Boardman Airport was originally built as part of the training range by the Air Force, but has since been turned over to the local government and is currently owned by the Port of Morrow. The gate for the range is located off of Bombing Range Road, which connects Interstate 84 at its junction with US 730 to Oregon State Route 207 on the south side of the range. The portion of Bombing Range Road adjacent to the installation is owned by the Navy but is open to the public. The arid climate, relative isolation, and flat terrain found on the installation make it an excellent location for the kind of training that the Navy uses it for. There are no year-round water bodies on the site. Runoff from rain and snow flows into two seasonal ponds. These were created to support ranching that happened before the military took over. ==History== Ruts from the Oregon Trail in the bombing range.Seven miles of the Well Springs Segment of the Oregon Trail is located within the boundaries of the installation and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This area is not currently bombed during practice runs, but was a handful of times during World War II. The bomb craters from these tests did not damage the ruts on the trail. The section on the Register is leased to local ranchers for grazing and includes a pioneer cemetery, the remains of a stage station, and a spring. The spring is no longer a reliable source of water due to nearby wells that have been drilled for irrigation. The cemetery is one of the largest known pioneer cemeteries on the trail. The War Department established the range through a series of land acquisitions between 1941 and 1943 and used it as a testing site for the Army Air Force during World War II. After the war, the range continued to be used by the Air Force until 1960 when it transferred about two-thirds of the land to the Navy, with smaller portions going to the state of Oregon and the Army Corps of Engineers. When the Air Force turned over the land, it was in a checkerboard fashon. Negotiations between the state government and the Navy gave the range the boundaries it has today. The state has leased its portion of the land to Boeing, which uses it for antenna testing, while the Navy has continued to use their portion for weapons testing. In 2012, a Chinese company named Sany acquired a wind farm adjacent to the range. Later that year, the Obama administration ordered the company to divest the acquisition after it determined that there was \\"credible evidence\\" that the company would use this to hurt national security. This order was the first of its kind since 1990. ===Air Force=== The Boardman Airport today.The War Department established the Arlington Bombing Range by acquiring of land between 1941 and 1943. It was during these early years that the Boardman Airport, then known as the Boardman Flight Strip, was constructed. For the duration of World War II, Walla Walla Army Air Base used it for air-to-ground firing practice. Following the war, the Army marked the land as surplus. In 1948, the Air Force again began training on the site. From 1952 to 1956, control of the range was granted to the 57th Air Division which was stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington. For the period from 1948 until the Air Force finally ceased use of the range, approximately 20 buildings, a flight strip, gunnery range, and several targets were constructed. The land was marked as excess by the Air Force on August 11, 1960. ===Transfer of Ownership=== In November of 1960, the Air Force transferred of the land to the Navy, with going to the Department of Interior and ending up in the hands of the Corps of Engineers. The part apportioned to the Department of Interior ended up in the hands of the state government. The checkerboard fashion of how the Air Force distributed the land didn't work well for use as a bombing range, so the Navy entered negotiations with the state. As a result of the negotiations, the Navy ended up with its current range, located in the eastern half of the original property. The remainder of the land is split in two portions, the first being jointly owned by the State of Oregon, Portland General Electric and Morrow County. The second portion continues to be owned by the Army Corps of Engineers, whose portion has decreased to slightly less than . ==Current Use== Since negotiations with the other owners completed, the Navy has used the range for weapons testing at high speeds. In 1978, they set aside for the Boardman Research Natural Area, which is a site used to study native grasses and restoration techniques. Further discussion on environmental impacts was initiated in 2000. In 2015, the Navy constructed a new office building to replace aged structures on the property that were being used for that purpose. The new building has offices for and can house six individuals. When active, the airspace comprises restricted areas R-5701 and R-5706. ===Boardman Research Natural Area=== The Navy set aside as the Boardman Research Natural Area within the facility. Access to the area for observation and experimentation is administered by the Officer in Charge, and those wishing to gain access must provide a written report of the purpose of their visit prior to gaining entry. The Research Natural Area is part of a nationwide network of protected areas of undisturbed ecosystems. Overnight camping within the area is prohibited, with visitors generally staying in Boardman. It is split into three sections, A, B, and C, which are located approximately in the center of the facility. Soils in the area were deposited by the Missoula floods during the last ice age. Sand dunes can be found in section C of the natural area and vegetation is classified as sagebrush steppe. Plants found include Russian thistle, snakeweed, and needle- and-thread grass. Several bird species, such as golden eagles, are year-round residents and small mammals like the long-tailed weasel and coyotes live within the ecosystem. It is also a seasonal nesting area for long-billed curlew. ===Non-military Activity=== The Boardman Coal Plant, which lies within the original bombing range.A significant portion of the original range was transferred outside of the military to both government and private entities. The State of Oregon owns the largest portion of the former range, which it leased to The Boeing Company. Boeing had originally intended to turn the area into a space park, but later decided to use the land for farming instead and in 1974 created the Boeing-Agri Industrial Company as a wholly owned subsidiary. A lawsuit was filed against Boeing-Agri Industrial Company in relation to how the company was pulling water out of the Willow Creek arm of the reservoir behind John Day Dam. They also maintain a remote antenna range on the leased property that conducts tests for national security purposes. Portland General Electric (PGE) owns to operate the Boardman Coal Plant. The plant, which opened in 1975, is one of the largest polluters in Oregon. It constitutes about 15% of PGE's electrical generation, but is scheduled to be shut down in 2020. ==Future== Several proposals are in place for improvements to the facility which would increase its usefulness in training exercises. The Navy and Oregon National Guard want to increase training at the range and introduce new aircraft such as F-35's. They also propose constructing new air- to-ground weapons systems. Construction of a new landing strip and a location to service unmanned aircraft, as well as a second target area, are among the improvements to on-site infrastructure deemed necessary to accomplish these goals. Beyond its use for air-to-ground training, the military also wants to develop several areas for ground training. These include a machine gun range, digital range, convoy live fire range, and a demolition range. The installation of remote cameras would aid in training by providing visual information to determine the accuracy of weapons tests. Idaho Power is seeking permission from the Navy to construct of its new power line to tie into a proposed substation that the Bonneville Power Administration plans to build near Boardman. This routing through the range would avoid cutting through farmland. ==References *Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility Boardman Environmental Impact Statement *Boardman RNA Category:1941 establishments in Oregon Category:Military installations in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Morrow County, Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Morrow County, Oregon Category:Oregon Trail ","title":"Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility Boardman"},{"id":"56769718","text":"Zdeněk Stromšík (born 25 November 1994) is a Czech sprinter.

These individual cards are usually of higher value than contemporary cards which are often sold as \\"bulk\\" or as a personal collection. Ordinary collectible cards serve little function beyond memorabilia, but CCGs are also used in game tournaments. Generally, collectible card games (CCG) fetch initial higher prices than trading cards because of the dual nature of being both a game and a collectible. Prices will fluctuate for CCGs as cards become legal or illegal to play in certain game formats. ==Value== A single card's value is determined by its scarcity. However, coupled with artificial scarcity and the function of a card in CCGs, prices for a single card can increase. Powerful cards can mean the difference between winning or losing in a tournament. This can also be called the \\"playability\\" of a card. ===Grading=== Cards are graded according to their physical condition and categories may vary depending on the source. The better the grade, the higher the price of the card. *Mint - A card with no flaws - straight out of a booster pack and into a card sleeve or other protective case. *Near Mint - A card with almost no visible wear or sign of being played. *Excellent/Fine/Slightly Played - A card that has been used but with minimal wear. *Very Good/Good - A card that has been used but may have more wear than a card in Excellent condition. May have slightly bent corners or wear on many of the edges or faces of the card. *Fair/Moderately Played - Many visible signs of wear or discoloration. Bent corners, creases, scuffing or other imperfections. May be banned from tournament play. *Poor/Heavily Played - Heavily abused card with significant wear or damage. Most likely not playable in tournaments. ==Collecting== It is often said that when playing a CCG, the best way to obtain the cards you desire is not via booster packs, but by buying the individual singles you need for your deck. Purchasing booster packs is often seen as a form of gambling, since you don't know what you'll get until after you've paid. Even though the price for an individual card may be more than the price of booster pack, you will likely save money in the long run, as opposed to randomly getting one from a booster pack. ==Autographs== Some singles have been autographed by someone related to the card. The person who autographed the card may be depicted, or their artwork is visible on the card. Cards may also be autographed by the card designer or by a person famous for using that card. The value of an autographed card has been debated, often depending on who has autographed it or the scarcity of the autograph. In some cases, an autograph can be seen as damage to the card, or graffiti. ==Counterfeits== Fake cards are made to imitate real cards and often sold into the card market. In November 1995, Canadian police were notified of counterfeiters in the Windsor, Ontario area. The police seized 40,000 fake Magic: the Gathering cards, including film plates. ==See also== *Card sleeve *Card binder ==References== Category:Card game terminology Category:Collectible card games Category:Trading cards ","title":"Singles (cards)"},{"id":"56769740","text":"Afaha Iman is a village in the Etinan local government area of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. == References == Category:Akwa Ibom State Category:Villages in Akwa Ibom ","title":"Afaha Iman"},{"id":"56769778","text":"China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation is a construction subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation specializing in the construction of refineries and chemical fertilizer plants connected to refineries, and mining plants. ==References== Category:Construction and civil engineering companies of China ","title":"China Huanqiu Contracting &amp; Engineering Corporation"},{"id":"56769780","text":"Ascandra is a genus of calcareous sponges of the family Leucaltidae and are found in oceans around the world. ==Species== As of 2019, 15 valid species of Ascandra are recognized: * Ascandra ascandroides (Borojevic, 1971) * Ascandra atlantica (Thacker, 1908) * Ascandra biscayae (Borojevic & Boury-Esnault, 1987) * Ascandra brandtae (Rapp, Göcke, Tendal & Janussen, 2013) * Ascandra contorta (Bowerbank, 1866) * Ascandra corallicola (Rapp, 2006) * Ascandra crewsi Van Soest & De Voogd, 2015 * Ascandra densa Haeckel, 1872 * Ascandra falcata Haeckel, 1872 * Ascandra izuensis (Tanita, 1942) * Ascandra kakaban Van Soest & De Voogd, 2015 * Ascandra loculosa (Dendy, 1891) * Ascandra minchini Borojevic, 1966 * Ascandra sertularia Haeckel, 1872 * Ascandra spalatensis Klautau, Imesek, Azevedo, Plese, Nikolic & Cetkovic, 2016 ==References== Category:Clathrinida Category:Taxa named by Ernst Haeckel ","title":"Ascandra"},{"id":"56769784","text":"Edem Ekpat is a village in Etinan local government area of Akwa Ibom State in Nigeria. == References == Category:Akwa Ibom State Category:Villages in Akwa Ibom ","title":"Edem Ekpat"},{"id":"56769786","text":"For the 1947–48 season, Carlisle United F.C. competed in Football League Third Division North. ==Results & fixturesFootball League Third Division North=== {  !

He replaced Martin Okoth Ochola, who was promoted to Inspector General of Police. Immediately prior to his present assignment, Sabiiti, at the rank of Brigadier, served as the Commander of the Military Police of the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF). ==Background and education== He was born in Mbarara District circa 1975. Sabiiti’s father Zekeriah Muzeyi Magyenyi was married to one of Museveni’s maternal aunties. A veteran of Uganda's bush war, Magyenyi died in June 2007. Sabiiti’s mother is Javanis Magyenyi. The young Sabiiti attended Ntare School, then Mbarara High School before he was admitted to Makerere University, Uganda's oldest and largest public university. At Makerere he studied biochemistry, graduating with a First Class Honors degree of Bachelor of Science. In 1997, he joined the UPDF, signing up in what was then the Presidential Protection Unit (PPU). PPU has since been renamed the Special Forces Command (SFC). Sabiiti attended boot camp at Kasenyi Training Wing, in Entebbe. A total of 117 recruits began the basic training course. Twenty five of them dropped out and the new Captain Sabiiti Muzeyi graduated at the top of the remaining 92. Later, he studied at the Uganda Senior Command and Staff College, in Jinja, in Uganda's Eastern Region. At the rank of Colonel, he won a slot to attend a senior command course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas. When the United States government blocked his admission, he was instead sent to a military college in Russia. ==Career== Sabiiti was a member of the PPU security forces that provided VIP security during the visit of United States President Bill Clinton to Uganda 1998. He then enrolled into graduate school and lectured part-time on the advice of family members, before returning to the PPU. He progressively rose in rank, taking on increased responsibility on the way. When PPU was renamed Presidential Guard Brigade (PGB), with first-son Muhoozi Kainerugaba at the helm, Sabiiti Muzeyi was selected as his second-in-command. Sabiiti, at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, commanded the unit, when Muhoozi was in South Africa, attending a military course. When Muhoozi was promoted to Brigadier, Sabiiti was elevated to Colonel. He became Brigadier and Commander of the Uganda Military Police, after his return from the Russian military course. On the evening of Sunday 4 March 2018, he was appointed Deputy Inspector General of Police, to deputize Martin Okoth Ochola. In February 2019, as part of a promotion exercise involving over 2,000 men and women in the UPDF, he was promoted from Brigadier to Major General. ==Family== Steven Sabiiti Muzeeyi is married to Esther Sabiiti, and together are the parents of two children. ==See also== * Uganda Police Force * Katumba Wamala * Luke Kercan Ofungi * Don Nabasa ==References *Brigadier Sabiiti Muzeyi appointed military police commander As at 4 April 2017.

Ottawa Citizen, March 2, 2001. The Tanguay siblings grew up as orphans, after their father died and their mother (Louise Portal) ran off with her new lover.

It lies southeast of London Zoo, close to the highest point of Regent's Park, about above sea level, in an area with few trees, making it widely visible across the park. The drinking fountain was erected in 1869, with the £1,400 cost funded by Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney, a successful Parsee businessman and philanthropist from Bombay, as a token of thanks to the people of England for their protection of the Parsees in British India. The structure was built to the Gothic design of Robert Keirle, who was the architect of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association. It was constructed by the sculptor Henry Ross, using 10 tons of white marble from Sicily, and 4 tons of pink and grey granite from Aberdeen. The main four- sided structure rests on three octagonal steps. The central white marble block has a pink granite basin on each side, with granite standing blocks on the ground beside each basin. Small apertures were included at the base of the central block to allow dogs to drink. Above each basin is a carved marble panel, with one depicting a lion and another a Brahmin bull, topped by a frieze decorated with inlaid stars and a triangular pediment resembling a gable. The central block rises to a gabled spire with a decorative terminal, with three pink granite columnettes rising to a single pinnacle at each corner. Three of the gables have a carved bust, depicting Readymoney, Prince Albert, and Queen Victoria, and the fourth has a clock. The drinking fountain was unveiled on 1 August 1869 by Princess Mary of Teck; she was a granddaughter of George III, and her daughter later became Queen Mary. It was listed at Grade II in 1970, and it was restored in 1999–2000 with over £400,000 of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. A modern plaque above the basin on the south face of the fountain reads: :\\"This fountain erected by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association was the gift of Sir Cowasjee Jehangir (Companion of the Star of India), a wealthy Parsee gentleman of Bombay, as a token of gratitude to the people of England for the protection enjoyed by him and his Parsee fellow countrymen under the British rule in India. Inaugurated by H.R.H. Princess Mary, Duchess of Teck, 1869. Restoration supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund 1999 – 2000. Further restoration work was undertaken in 2016 and 2017. The water no longer runs, but a modern drinking fountain has been installed nearby.

He spent his childhood in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies and was educated in a Dutch vocational school (Burgersavondschool) and probably also in a Chinese school (Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan). At the age of 21 (in 1913), together with Lie Biauw Kie, Tjia Tjiep Ling, Tan Tjiang Ling, Liem Thoan Tik, and Liem Tjhioe Kwie, he founded the first weekly published in Surabaya named Bok Tok. In 1914 he became chief editor of Tjhoen Tjhioe's weekly led by Tjoa Jan Hie. In the same year he became chief editor of Palita in Yogyakarta. In 1916 he was invited to the capital Batavia where he was made editor in chief of the daily Sin Po. The first editor of the paper had been a European for legal reasons so Kwee was the first Chinese to hold this position.Sin Po Jubileum Nummer 1910-1935 (Djakarta: Sin Po, 1935). There he advocated for Chinese nationalism and was critical of the Dutch. During this era he believed that Ethnic Chinese in the Indies should not involve themselves in local politics nor be compelled to serve in the proposed local defense forces which were being discussed at the time (the Indië Weerbaar). In 1918 he was sent to Europe on behalf of the business firm Hoo Tik Thay in order to help them with tobacco exports, although he continued to write for Sin Po. He traveled in Europe for four years and lived in Berlin for a time. In 1921 he wrote a book titled (Malay: lit. Two Heads of Stone, or Two Stubborn Men), an account of Chinese politics in Java. He returned to the Dutch East Indies in 1923 but when he arrived at the Port of Tanjung Priok he was refused entry. Then he settled in Shanghai, where he lived for ten years, and wrote for various newspapers in China and Java. Despite his long-standing advocacy of Chinese nationalism, he felt like a foreigner there. In 1934 he was allowed to return to the Indies under the guarantee of Oei Tiong Hauw of the Oei Tiong Ham Concern. With their support he founded a new Chinese-Malay newspaper called (Malay: The Sun). His early staff were Liem Koen Hian, Mr. Ko Kwat Tiong, Kwee Tek Hoaij, Kwee Thiam Tjing, Njonja Tjoa Hin Hoei, Njonja Lim Sam Tjiang and Miss Thung Tien. Based on his experience living in Europe and China, his political views shifted and he realized that peranakan Chinese were more culturally Indonesian than Chinese. For example, he met the Chinese ambassador in Vienna and was embarrassed by his inability to express himself in the language. In the 1930s, under the influence of Indonesian nationalists, he advanced the idea that Indies Chinese were also (Malay: sons of Indonesia).

Article 43 of the Vienna Convention granted \\"signatory gentlemen\\" to establish a company with residence in Vienna and to issue, after the approval of the company's bylaws, individual or bearer shares whose nominal value was not less than 600 Austrian lire. The company thus constituted therefore took over all the rights and obligations of the \\"concessionaire gentlemen\\". The convention had \\"the purpose of fulfilling, in the interest of commerce, as soon as possible the network of railway tracks of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia and to simplify possibly the exercise and administration of the railways belonging to the Imperial Royal Treasury and forming part of the same network\\". It was essentially the sale of the network already built in Lombardy-Venetia and the concessions granted. The concession for the railway track of central Italy and its branches was then added. ===Finance=== The convention saw, as actors on one side, the imperial- ministers of finance and trade and on the other: ;In Vienna The president of the Austrian Credit Association for Trade and Industry, Prince Giovanni Adolfo of Schwarzenberg, the vice-presidents, Count Francesco Zichy and Baron A. S. di Rothschild of the Rothschild banking house. ;In Italy The Duke of Galliera, Raffaele de Ferrari in Bologna, the Duke Lodovico Melzi in Milan, Count Giuseppe Archinto in Milan represented by Messrs.

Blount and Compagni, Paulin Talabot in Paris. ;In England Rothschild and sons of London, represented by the Rothschild banking house in Vienna, Samuel Laing and Matteo Uzielli of London. ===The concession=== The Austrian government ceded the Lombardy- Venetia (Lombardisch-Venetianische Staatsbahn) railway network, except the railway from Verona to South Tyrol, to the consortium of banks (often referred to as the company of Lombard-Veneto railways) for a global sum of 100 million Austrian lire in exchange for the concession granted for 90 years starting from 1 January 1856. Società anonima delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia centrale was the name, in Italian, with which the Imperial-Royal company (concessionaire of the railway network of the Kingdom of Lombardy- Venetia and Central Italy) was indicated in its entry to the Stock Exchange of Milan from 1 July 1858. The inscription was also the first of a joint-stock company in the said stock exchange which, until now, had only dealt with government bonds. However, the company was already listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since its establishment at the end of 1856. ===War=== Proceedings were delayed by the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859 following which the territory was divided by moving the border of Lombardy-Venetia to the Mincio and part of the network was incorporated into the Sudbahn. The company was in possession of the agreements signed with the Austrian Government on 14 March 1856, 8 April 1857 and 23 September 1858 and with the Austrian, Parma, Modena, Tuscany and Papal Governments on 17 March 1856. These were reconfirmed, with due variations in the agreement, and signed by the representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of Italy on June 25, 1860. The convention confirmed largely the previous ones but with some variations, including the revocation of the construction of the section up to Borgoforte. ===Final approval=== On 8 July 1860 the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy approved the Convention of 25 June with which the concessions of railways in the territory granted to the Company were recognized and confirmed (with the modifications specified in the same agreement and in the annexed documents agreements with the Austrian Government, on March 14, 1856, April 8, 1857 and September 23, 1858 and the convention of March 17, 1856 with the Austrian, Parma, Modenese, Tuscan and Papal governments). Following the changes, the Società anonima delle strade ferrate della Lombardia e dell'Italia Centrale was subsequently established. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Doc. 4241, Approvazione Senato e Camera Deputati della Convenzione tra i ministri di S.

It is known from the Late Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation (early Late Campanian stage, about 77.5-76.5 Ma ago) of southern Alberta, Canada. The type species is Platypelta coombsi. ==Discovery and naming== Pelvis of the holotype specimen In 1914, Barnum Brown and Peter Kaisen, working for the American Museum of Natural History, in Alberta at the Sand Creek near the Red Deer River, eight miles southeast of Steveville, excavated an ankylosaur skeleton, specimen AMNH 5337. In 1971, it was referred to Euoplocephalus tutus by Walter Preston Coombs. In 2001 however, Paul Penkalski concluded that this skeleton was nearly identical to another exemplar, AMNH 5403, and that both likely represented a separate taxon.Penkalski, P., 2001, \\"Variation in specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus\\", pp 261-298 in: Carpenter, K. (ed.): The Armored Dinosaurs Bloomington (Indiana University Press) In 2013, Victoria Megan Arbour en Philip Currie continued referring it to Euoplocephalus as AMNH 5337 differed from Scolosaurus and Dyoplosaurus in the pelvic region. In 2018, Penkalski published a study containing a cladistic analyses of such forms. In it, AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5403 were recovered in a joint different position from Euoplocephalus tutus specimens CMN 210, UALVP 31, and AMNH 5406. He named a separate genus for AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5403: Platypelta, with as type species Platypelta coombsi. The generic name is derived from Greek platys, \\"wide\\", and plate, \\"small shield\\", in reference to the broad osteoderms. The specific name honors Walter P. Coombs Jr., who pioneered the study of ankylosaurs in the late twentieth century. The holotype, AMNH 5337, was found in a layer of the Dinosaur Park Formation at an altitude of 667 metres, which indicates an age of about 76,8 million years. It consists of a skeleton with skull, lacking the tail and hindlimbs. It represents a mature and aged individual, in view of fused ribs, a fused shoulder girdle, rough articulation surfaces and rough armour. Specimens AMNH 5403, CMN 8876, ROM 788, and ROM 813 were referred to Platypelta. AMNH 5403 consists of the severely compressed front half of a skeleton including the skull. A short tail club has been stored with this skeleton, but Penkalski doubted the connection, pointing out that the club was not marked nor mentioned in the accession catalogue. CMN 8876 is a skull preserving a single tooth. ROM 788 is a tail club. ROM 813 is a skeleton lacking the skull but containing the entire rump, forelimbs and hindlimbs. Apart from a large number of osteoderms, it preserves skin impressions. It has been secured on three blocks that have not been fully prepared to conserve the impressions. Penkalski already in 2001 suggested it represented a taxon different from Euoplocephalus. ==Description== Referred skull AMNH 5403 Platypelta is a rather large ankylosaurid. In 2018, its length was estimated at six metres. According to Penkalski, Platypelta is typified by a number of traits. Some of the armour plates on its rump are large, exceeding twenty-five centimetres in length, and have a rough top surface with a sharp keel continuing into a pointy beak-shape. The snout is constricted just in front of the eye sockets. The upper beak, of the snout, is rounded and relatively small. The vomers at their front side overlap the rear underside of the fused premaxillae. At the rear of the skull, the occipital condyle is large. The squamosal horns, at the rear corners of the skull roof, are low and rough with a broad base and a pitted point extending to behind. The tooth crowns are strongly ornamented. In the lower arm, the ulna is long and lightly built. In the pelvis, the front blade of the ilium only lightly bends to below. The foot is robust with arched claws. On the first cervical halfring, the transverse armour band protecting the top front of the neck, the paired middle osteoderms are elongated and partly keeled with a conical projection. On the first cervical halfring, the lateral, or side, osteoderms have a bent but not wavy keel of which the point sticks out to the rear. ==Phylogeny== Platypelta was in 2018 placed, within the Ankylosauridae, in the Ankylosaurinae. More precisely it was a member of the clade Euoplocephalini. In the evolutionary tree it was placed above Scolosaurus and below Dyoplosaurus. ==See also== * Timeline of ankylosaur research *2018 in paleontology ==References== Category:Ankylosaurids Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 2018 Category:Paleontology in Alberta Category:Campanian genus first appearances Category:Campanian genus extinctions ","title":"Platypelta"},{"id":"56770481","text":"Lombardy elected its sixth delegation to the Italian Senate on May 19, 1972. This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1972 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race. The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party. ==Background== This election was quite a copy of the previous one. The Italian Liberal Party was the sole loser, to its left to the Italian Republican Party and to its right to the Italian Social Movement. ==Electoral system== The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected. ==Results== -

Zhu was noted for his combining of Confucian and Islamic values in his philosophy. == Biography == Zhu was born in Yongchang Fu in Yunnan Province during the reign of the Qing dynasty. His father died when Zhu was young. He is claimed to be a descendant of Ajall Shams al-Din Omar, a Muslim Mongol general, and of the Prophet Mohammed.Three eminent Chinese ‘Ulama’ of Yunnan https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02666959008716154?journalCode=cjmm19 == Philosophy == Ma Zhu's philosophy focused heavily on social relations and interactions between the sexes. He theorized that, per Confucian and Islamic values, an ideal society would be one in which men dominated public affairs while women would serve in a subservient role as domestic helpmates. The philosopher opposed women performing roles outside of the home, stating \\"Even a talented woman should not take care of non-domestic affairs.\\" Zhu took inspiration for his ideal role for women from the story of Adam and Eve, in which Allah created Eve from the flesh of Adam. This indicated to Zhu that men and women were not intended to be of equal standing in society. In his work Qingzhen Zhinan (清眞指南), Zhu noted, Zhu's philosophy also denoted the distinctions between the traditional Chinese paired forces of Ming and Xing, Yin and yang. According to Zhu, Ming represented what was preordained by Allah, while Xing represented by what was acquirable though social conditioning and exposure to earthly human existence. Similarly, in Zhu's view yin represented the earthly acquired and yang represented the divinely innate. Parts from both were required to form any human, but men and women differed in terms of how much of each respective force they embodied. In Qingzhen Zhinan, Zhu posited that men were composed primarily of yang while women favoured yin. Thus, Zhu concluded that men's dispositions favoured sacredness and nobility in contrast to the worldly and \\"debased\\" dispositions of women. Zhu also noted that their reliance on yin granted females a propensity towards greed, hesitation, impropriety, and contemptuousness towards the poor. However, Zhu also believed that women should strive to be similar to famous women in Islam in order to overcome their evil proclivities. Zhu mentioned Moleyan, Khadiyah, and Fatima as examples of women who had overcome the immoral tendencies of their sex and become closer to Allah. In addition to his views on gender, Zhu also advocated for both men and women to pursue an Islamic education. == See also == * Wang Daiyu * Yusuf Ma Dexin * Liu Zhi (scholar) * List of Hanafis * List of Ash'aris and Maturidis * List of Muslim theologians == References == Category:17th-century Chinese people Category:Chinese Muslims Category:Hanafis Category:Maturidis Category:Muslim theologians Category:Shaykh al-Islāms Category:Sunni imams Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:1640 births Category:1711 deaths ","title":"Ma Zhu"},{"id":"56770596","text":"Pawlica is a Polish surname.

Many Haredim do not listen to the radio or have access to the internet, leaving them with little or no access to breaking news. News hotlines were formed to fill this gap, and many have expanded to additional fields over time. Currently, many news lines provide rabbinic lectures, entertainment, business advice and similar services, in addition to their primary function of reporting the news. Many hasidic sects maintain their own hotlines, where relevant internal news is reported and the group's perspective can be advocated for. In the Israeli Haredi community, there are dozens of prominent hotlines, in both Yiddish and Hebrew. Some Haredi hotlines have played significant public roles, however many prominent services have faced struggles. ==Kol Mevaser== Kol Mevaser is a Yiddish news hotline. It reports the news, weather, lottery, traffic, and carries interviews and scholarly lectures on various topics of interest to the Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish community. ==Frum News Wire== Frum News Wire, or FNW, is based in Lakewood Township, New Jersey. FNW carries local and world news, audio recordings of notable events, and various forms of entertainment. FNW has had interviews with notable hareidi personalities, such as Jake Turx, Yossi Gestetner, and Richard Roberts.. According to FNW, most callers call more than once a day, and the hotline has an average total of fifteen thousand calls a day. It says that the majority of its listeners are from the tri-state area, with approximately half from Lakewood. ==Yeshiva International Newsline== Yeshiva International Newsline, often referred to as YIN, is a Haredi news hotline, based in Lakewood Township, New Jersey. ===History=== YIN was started in 2012 on a restricted access network which required a password, and was advertised by word of mouth. Often broadcasting news that was unavailable in the mainstream English language hareidi media, it successfully carved out a niche for itself within the Haredi yeshiva community. In its early period, the hotline issued extensive coverage of the plans and efforts underway in Israel to initiate a compulsory draft of Haredi yeshiva students.The hotline espoused a Satmar like position, and strongly praised Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach and his no compromise policy regarding the draft law. ===Current format=== YIN eventually switched to an open access system and started carrying advertisements. As the hotline grew more popular, YIN gradually shifted from its intense focus on Israeli Haredi news to more general coverage, although it continues to report Israeli news. Together with news reports, the hotline features a music section, rabbinic lectures, documentaries (deemed appropriate for the hareidi audience), and various seasonal sections, usually before major Jewish holidays. ==See also== *Hamodia *Yated Ne'eman (United States) ==References* * *The Frum Rush Limbaugh - an article about the (now defunct) Kol Haolam newsline Category:Information by telephone Category:Haredi Judaism Category:Telecommunication services ","title":"Haredi news hotline"},{"id":"56770686","text":"Sun Weizhe (; born 1 January 1997) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for China League One side Beijing Renhe. ==Club career== Sun Weizhe started his professional football career in 2015 when he was promoted to Chinese Super League club Guizhou Renhe's first team squad.

However, in 2011, Grupo RBS began to experience financial problems when its employees began to be detained for crimes against the country's national financial system as part of Operation Zelotes. Over the next four years, the group terminated the contracts of dozens of employees and rumors began to build about a potential sale of RBS TV's affiliates. On March 7, 2016, RBS announced that its affiliates that are based in Santa Catarina would be sold to a new ownership group headed by the owner of Grupo NC. The sale was approved by CADE on July 15. In October 2016, Grupo NC began to drop all instances of the RBS TV name from its newly acquired television affiliates.

Originally built as the 279 class, as a result of renumbering they became known as the 71 Class in 1919, before passing to the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) on its formation in 1923, where they were given power classification 4F. ==History== Until the retirement of James Manson from the post of locomotive superintendent at the end of 1911, the development of Glasgow and South Western Railway locomotives had been a matter of gradual evolution. Successive locomotive superintendents had learned their trade at the company's Kilmarnock Locomotive Works before reaching the top job. Most of the locomotives were efficient and reliable machines, but by 1911 many were elderly and even the newer locomotives were somewhat small by contemporary standards. The appointment of Peter Drummond to replace Manson marked a departure from previous practice, as Drummond was an 'outsider' to the G&SWR; with little affinity for the established Kilmarnock design principles and a preference for larger locomotives. The 279 Class 0-6-0s were Drummond's first design for the G&SWR;, and in keeping with his 'big engine' policy they were the heaviest 0-6-0s in Britain at the time of construction (their weight only being exceeded by the later LNER J38 and J39 classes). Despite their size they were not equipped with superheating as Peter Drummond (like his brother Dugald on the London and South Western Railway) instead preferred to use smokebox 'steam driers'. The locomotives had very little in common with previous G&SWR; designs, even to the extent that they were driven from the left side of the cab - a change which was inevitably unpopular with enginemen who were used to driving from the right. The new locomotives were delivered to Corkerhill and Currock locomotive sheds for use on goods traffic between Glasgow and Carlisle, but problems soon became apparent. Whilst they steamed well and were capable of hauling the 50 wagon trains they were designed for, the locomotives were extremely slow on the uphill sections of the line, had high coal and lubricating oil consumption, and were prone to overheating bearings. The marine pattern big ends were particularly prone to failure. Their performance and reliability was so poor that the company agreed to pay drivers and firemen a bonus of sixpence per single trip with a 279, provided they managed to complete at least three-quarters of the distance between Glasgow and Carlisle without it suffering a failure. For the G&SWR;'s next batch of goods engines Drummond designed the 403 class, which was a superheated development of the 279 class with a leading pony truck. Eventually various modifications were carried out to improve the 279 class, including removal of the steam driers and the fitting of new cottered big ends. Reliability was greatly improved, but the very slow climbing speed was unchanged. Under LMS ownership the Carlisle-based locomotives were transferred from Currock to the former Caledonian Railway shed at Carlisle Kingmoor, and they began to be used on a wider range of routes. From 1925 the availability of former Caledonian and new LMS Fowler Class 4F 0-6-0s enabled the class to be cascaded to less demanding duties and some engines were transferred to Ayr and Ardrossan sheds. As a class of only 15 locomotives they inevitably fell foul of the LMS standardisation policy, so they were withdrawn and scrapped in 1930-1933 when their boilers became due for replacement. ==Accidents and Incidents== On 2 July 1928 locomotive 17759 was working a freight train from Stranraer to Glasgow which derailed whilst passing over a 15mph curve at Pinwherry at around 50mph, killing the driver and fireman. The reason for the excessive speed could not be conclusively established, but the driver had only recently been promoted to work over the Stranraer line and the accident inspector speculated that he may have forgotten about the tight curve at Pinwherry. If so, the driver may have intentionally built up speed on the downhill run from Chirmorlie to Pinwherry in order to make a good run up the ensuing climb to Pinmore. ==Numbering== * NBL works numbers: 20113-20127 * G&SWR; 1913 numbers: 279, 292-305 * G&SWR; 1919 numbers: 71-85 * LMS 1923 numbers: 17750-17764 source ==References== * * Category:0-6-0 locomotives 403 Category:NBL locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1913 Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"G&amp;SWR 279 Class"},{"id":"56770939","text":"Isabel Kutner de Souza (born May 27, 1970 in Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian actress and theater director. == Biography == The actress Isabel Kutner de Souza was born on May 27, 1970, daughter of actors Dina Sfat and Paulo José, and sister of actress Ana Kutner and director Clara Kutner. == Career == The choice of profession was easy and precocious.

Slauerhoff. First published in 1928 under the pseudonym John Ravenswood, the collection contains poems whose theme is the Far East, a part of the globe Slauerhoff knew from his career as a sailor. ==Contents== Oost-Azië contains four sections. The first and the third are collections of various poems; the second and the third are themed sections, dedicated to Macao and Korea respectively. #8 various poems, mostly landscapes and topical poems #a group of 4 poems about Macau, the last one a biographical sonnet about Luís de Camões #15 various poems, including landscape and character sketches #7 poems about Korea The first section opens with an editorial comment, in which \\"J. Slauerhoff\\" explains that he is publishing these verses on behalf of the recently deceased \\"John Ravenswood\\", a Dutchman of Scottish descent, who had withdrawn from Western life to Jeju Island (then called \\"Quelpart\\" by Europeans) where he married a local woman after deserting the whaling ship on which he sailed. Macau occupies an important place in Slauerhoff's work; it is the setting of his 1931 novel Het verboden rijk, in which Camões was one of the two protagonists. Oost-Aziës Macao section is dedicated to Constâncio José da Silva, an important Macanese newspaper editor. Two of the Macao poems, and a poem about a Portuguese fort in Asia, were translated into French for Fleurs de Marécage. ==Critical reception== Nico Donkersloot, in a comparison between Oost-Azië and Eldorado, which Slauerhoff published under his own name in the same year, called the former less grand than the latter, but with a more exciting \\"plasticity\\" in its poetry. Donkersloot describes the poems as finely-drawn sketches with exquisite lines that avoid the simplicity of easy rhymes and instead feature unexpected and curious \\"magnetic\\" rhymes, an effect achieved by rhyming polysyllabically. He compares the poems to Japanese prints, detailed and sharp and sometimes rivaling the work of Herman Gorter. Hendrik Marsman noted that Oost-Azië appeared at roughly the same time as Eldorado, and that some of the poems would have fit better, perhaps, in that collection. Marsman singles out \\"Captain Miguel\\", a 44-line biography (dedicated to \\"J. Slauerhoff\\"!) of a former sailor who withdraws from life and settles for a mundane and repetitive existence aboard a coaster that goes up and down the coast of China. The poem's description of the \\"rough tramp's life of a desperado\\" is typical of Slauerhoff, and according to Marsman it is treated here more eloquently, in less \\"barbarous\\" verse, than in Eldorado, and unlike some of those poems is more easily \\"inhabited\\" by the reader. Oost-Azië focuses on landscapes, bays, objects, whereas Eldorado portrays people, and in a much more direct manner, in more or less autobiographical poems. On the whole, Marsman thought the collection decent though never of superior quality, and falling short of Slauerhoff's poetic talent. ==References *Oost-Azië, first edition (PDF) Category:Dutch poetry collections Category:1928 poetry books ","title":"Oost-Azië"},{"id":"56771183","text":"Jo Chandler (born 1965) is an Australian journalist, science writer and educator.

Walters (born July 15, 1946) is an American entrepreneur, philanthropist, and retired professional gambler widely regarded as among the most successful sports bettors in Las Vegas, having a winning streak which extended for over 30 years. In 1987, Walters stopped all gambling other than sports betting and returned to his roots in business. As of 2016, his holding company owned interests in eight car dealerships with one under construction, one golf course on the Las Vegas Strip, a rental-car franchise, and a number of commercial properties. In 2014, his net worth was estimated at more than $100 million. ==Early life== Walters grew up poor in the rural town of Munfordville, Kentucky. His father, an auto mechanic, died when Walters was 18 months old. His mother, who was an alcoholic, walked out on her son and two daughters shortly after his father's death. He was raised by his grandmother in a home with no running water or indoor plumbing. Walters credits his grandmother, a devout Baptist, with instilling a strong work ethic. She worked two jobs cleaning houses and washing dishes while raising seven children. At the age of seven, Walters secured a $40 bank loan for a power lawnmower to start a grass-cutting business. At age nine, he secured a second loan for $90 to start a paper route. His grandmother arranged both loans for Walters. His grandmother died when Walters was 13, forcing him to move to Louisville, KY, to be with his mother. There he worked two jobs, one in the morning at a bakery and the second at a gas station in the evenings. He rented a room in the basement from his mother. He married and had a child before graduating high school. The marriage was short-lived. ==Business success== In 1965, Walters went to work as a salesman at McMackin Auto Sales, a used-car lot in Louisville. Each time he sold a car, he mailed a self-promotion letter to 10 people living on each side of that customer's home. He would peruse the daily newspaper for car ads, inviting the ads' sellers to do trades with him. He went through the phone book and cold-called people. Walters sold an average of 32 cars a month and earned $56,000 a year in 1966, equal to about $400,000 today. Walters worked 80 hours a week selling cars and setting dealership records. In 1967, he was hired as sales manager at Steven's Brothers Auto Sales, a competing dealership. He worked at Stevens Brothers until 1972, when he started his own business, Taylor Boulevard Auto Sales, wholesaling cars to other dealers throughout the southeastern United States. During that time, Walters also remained involved in sports betting. In 1981, he left the automobile industry to become a full-time sports bettor. He was running his own betting service on the side and, in 1982, pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession of gambling records in Kentucky. The charge later was expunged from his record. It was then that he decided to move with his wife, Susan, to Las Vegas, where opportunity beckoned and betting on sports was legal. ==Gambling career== Walters started gambling when he was 9 years old, when he bet the money he earned from his paper route on the New York Yankees to beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1955 World Series. The Dodgers won and Walters lost the bet, but it did not deter him from gambling. Walters was a losing gambler as late as 1982. He had lost $50,000 by the time he was 22. Walters once lost his house during a game of pitching nickels. The winner did not take possession; Walters agreed to pay off the debt over the next 18 months. Walters' success changed in his mid to late 30s. In June 1986, Walters requested a freeze-out with Caesars Atlantic City for $2 million at the roulette tables. Walters was known to have lost $1 million at least twice at the Las Vegas blackjack tables. Caesars, however, declined his request. Walters then took his proposition to the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel, then known as the Golden Nugget, which was accepted. Walters and his gambling partner delivered $2 million to the cage at the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel. The pair noticed a wheel bias and bet on the 7-10-20-27-36. After 38 hours of play they won $3,800,000, beating the prior record of $1,280,000 held by Richard W. Jarecki at the San Remo Casino in Monte Carlo in 1971. Three years later his \\"Syndicate\\" had won $400,000 at a casino in Las Vegas and an additional $610,000 from Claridge Casino in Atlantic City. Walters also captured the 1986 Super Bowl of Poker, (also known as Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker or SBOP) in Lake Tahoe earning $175,000. ===Sports betting=== In the 1980s, Walters joined the Computer Group, which used computer analysis to analyze sports outcomes. Over a period of 39 years, Walters had only one losing year, with a 30-year winning streak. Though he has finished in the red for a few months, he was always in the black by the end of the year. Walters bet on basketball, NFL, and college football. Walters won $3.5 million on Super Bowl XLIV after betting on the New Orleans Saints. Due to his reputation, Walters often placed bets through \\"runners\\" so bookmakers would remain unaware of the person behind the bet. In January 2007, Walters won a $2.2 million bet on University of Southern California defeating University of Michigan; USC wonby a score of 32-18. In 2011, Walters claimed he could make between $50 to $60 million on a good year. ==Insider trading== In April 2017, Walters was found guilty of insider trading after using non-public information from Thomas C. Davis, a board member of Dean Foods. Walters was sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined $10 million. Lawyer Daniel Goldman, then an assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was part of the trial team. Walters' source, company director Thomas C. Davis, using a prepaid cell phone and sometimes the code words \\"Dallas Cowboys\\" for Dean Foods, helped Walters, between 2008 and 2014, realize profits and avoid losses in the stock, the Federal jury found. Walters gained $32 million in profits and avoided $11 million in losses. At the trial, investor Carl C. Icahn was mentioned in relation to Walters’ trading but was not charged with wrongdoing. Golfer Phil Mickelson \\"was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to\\" Walters. Mickelson \\"made roughly $1 million trading Dean Foods shares; he agreed to forfeit those profits in a related civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission\\". On December 4, 2018, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the insider trading conviction and 5 year sentence of Walters, even though it chastised an FBI agent for leaking grand jury information about the case. On October 7, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Walters’ appeal. Walters was initially imprisoned at Federal Prison Camp, Pensacola, but was released to home confinement in Carlsbad, California, on May, 1, 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic. His sentence is scheduled to be completed on January 10, 2022. ==Personal life== Walters has three children, and was an avid golfer. He claims to have made over $400,000 on one hole and once as much as $1 million in one round, although he admitted to losing a million at blackjack later that night. In June 2014, Walters had a private jet worth $20 million and owned seven homes, with a net worth estimated at over $100 million. Walters is a noted philanthropist and has donated to Opportunity Village, a Las Vegas nonprofit for people with intellectual disabilities. In September 2020, in response to Opportunity Village cancelling their two largest fundraising events because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Walters family committed to a $1 million matching donation. He and his wife Susan have been staunch Opportunity Village advocates for decades and were honored at the organization’s 11th annual black-tie gala Camelot in 2012. The couple were also honored as Las Vegas Philanthropists of the Year in 1997 by the Association of Fundraising Professionals Las Vegas Chapter ==See also== * Alan Woods (gambler) * Terry Ramsden * Haralabos Voulgaris ==References== Category:1946 births Category:American gamblers Category:Living people Category:People from Munfordville, Kentucky ","title":"Billy Walters (gambler)"},{"id":"56771428","text":"Esad Hasanović (born 24 January 1985) is a Serbian cyclist. ==Major results== ;2007 : 1st 20px National Time Trial Championships : 1st 20px Under-23 National Road Race Championships ;2008 : 1st 20px National Time Trial Championships : 1st Grand Prix Kooperativa ;2009 : 2nd Trofeo Zsšdi : 2nd National Road Race Championships : 2nd National Time Trial Championships : 6th Tour of Vojvodina I : 10th Overall Giro della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia ;2010 : 1st 20px National Time Trial Championships : 1st Grand Prix of Moscow : 3rd Overall Tour de Serbie ::1st Stage 1 ;2011 : 1st 20px National Criterium Championships : 2nd National Road Race Championships : 2nd National Time Trial Championships : 7th Overall Tour of Alanya : 9th Overall Tour of Gallipoli ;2012 : 3rd National Time Trial Championships : 6th National Road Race Championships : 9th Tour of Vojvodina II ;2013 : 1st 20px National Time Trial Championships : 2nd Overall Tour of Albania : 9th National Road Race Championships ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Serbian male cyclists ","title":"Esad Hasanović"},{"id":"56771430","text":"Escuela Hispano Árabe de Tánger was a Spanish football club based in Tangier, in Morocco. ==History== Founded in 1939 as a merger between the Spanish and the Moroccan teams of Hogar Español de Tánger, the club played its first season in the Segunda División thanks to the help of the city during the Spanish Civil War.

The film stars Jenna Kanell, Samantha Scaffidi, Catherine Corcoran, and David Howard Thornton as Art the Clown. The film follows Tara Heyes (Kanell) as she finds herself as Art's next target on Halloween night. It marks the second feature film appearance of the Art the Clown character, after Leone's 2013 anthology film All Hallows' Eve, which incorporated footage from previous short films that were also directed by Leone and featured the character. The main setting of the film, a decrepit apartment building, has been likened to symbolizing a labyrinth that the characters must traverse through as they battle Art. Terrifier premiered at the Telluride Horror Show Film Festival in October 2016 before being picked up by Dread Central Presents and Epic Pictures for a limited theatrical release in March 2018. ==Plot== Monica Brown, a talk show host, interviews a severely disfigured woman who is the sole survivor of a massacre that took place the previous Halloween. Brown mentions that the body of the killer, known only as \\"Art the Clown\\", disappeared from the morgue, suggesting that he is still alive. However, the disfigured woman insists that she saw him die. After the show, Monica insults the woman's appearance, after which the woman attacks Monica and gouges her eyes out. On Halloween night, two friends, Tara and Dawn, leave a Halloween party and drunkenly wander back to Dawn's car, where they notice a strange man in a clown costume. The man, Art the Clown, follows them into a nearby pizzeria. After a short time, the restaurant owner roughly escorts Art from the premises for smearing his own feces all over the bathroom walls. The girls discover that one of Dawn's car tires has been slashed, and Tara calls her sister Vicky to come pick them up. While waiting, Tara asks a pest control worker, Mike, if she can enter the derelict apartment building he's working in to use the restroom. Once inside, Tara encounters a deluded woman (credited as \\"Cat Lady\\"), who believes the doll she carries is her infant child. Art returns to the pizzeria, where he kills and mutilates the two workers before abducting Dawn. Tara soon encounters Art inside the apartment building. He pursues her through the indoor mechanic's garage and stabs her with a scalpel. She tries to alert Mike but Art drugs her. Tara awakens bound to a chair, and Art reveals Dawn, suspended upside-down from the ceiling. He forces Tara to watch as he saws Dawn in half with a handsaw. Tara escapes but Art draws a handgun and shoots her to death. The Cat Lady witnesses this and begs Mike to call the police. Mike dismisses her as insane, but Art soon knocks him unconscious with a hammer. The Cat Lady discovers Art cradling her doll. In a plea for the return of her \\"child\\", she tries to show motherly compassion to Art by cradling him. Vicky arrives to take Tara and Dawn home but is lured into the basement by Art. There, she discovers what she believes is an injured Tara, but it is actually Art, who has severely mutilated the Cat Lady and is wearing her scalp and breasts. Mike's co-worker arrives looking for him but is decapitated by Art. Vicky escapes Art but stops to grieve upon finding her sister's corpse. Art then attacks her with a makeshift cat o' nine tails, but Mike arrives suddenly and knocks Art unconscious. The two flee and call 9-1-1 but before they can escape, Art appears and kills Mike. Vicky retreats into a garage, and Art rams through the door with a pickup truck, causing further injury to Vicky. As she lies helplessly, Art begins to eat her face. Police arrive, but Art shoots himself in the head with a pistol before the officers can apprehend him. Art's body is taken to a morgue, along with the bodies of his deceased victims. When the medical examiner unzips Art's body bag, Art reanimates and strangles him to death. One year later, Vicky is released from the hospital after rehabilitation from the injuries inflicted by Art; she is revealed to be the severely disfigured woman from the film's opening scene. ==Cast Production == The character of Art the Clown first appeared in the 2008 short film The 9th Circle, which Leone wrote and directed. Leone later wrote and directed a short film titled Terrifier, which featured Art and was released in 2011. These shorts were incorporated into the 2013 anthology film All Hallows' Eve, which marked both Art's first feature film appearance and Leone's feature directorial debut. In 2015, Leone launched a campaign on the crowdfunding website Indiegogo to finance Terrifier, a feature-length spin-off of All Hallows' Eve. After being notified of the Indiegogo campaign, filmmaker Phil Falcone provided the necessary funds for the project in exchange for a producer credit. In The 9th Circle, the short film Terrifier, and All Hallows' Eve, Art was played by Mike Giannelli, but in the feature film Terrifier, Art was portrayed by David Howard Thornton. Thornton was already familiar with All Hallows' Eve when he auditioned for the role of Art in Terrifier, and was cast in the role after improvising a kill scene in mime. == Release == Terrifier premiered at the Telluride Horror Show Film Festival in 2016. It was later screened at the Horror Channel FrightFest on October 28, 2017, and was subsequently picked up by Dread Central Presents and Epic Pictures for a limited 2018 release. ===Home media=== Terrifier was released on DVD and Blu- ray by Dread Central on March 27, 2018. The release features audio commentary from Damien Leone and David H. Thorton, behind-the-scenes footage, an interview with star Jenna Kanell, deleted scenes, collectible reversible cover art, and several other bonus features. ===Critical response=== The film received mixed to positive reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Terrifier holds an approval rating of 64% based on 14 reviews, and an average rating of 6.21/10. While Thornton's portrayal and the special effects were well received by critics, criticism of the film was directed mostly at the dialogue, acting in certain scenes, and the lack of character development of the protagonists. Anton Bitel of the British Film Institute described the film as a \\"subtext-free thrill-and-kill ride which openly advertises the sheer senselessness and gratuity of all its on-screen cat-and-mouse deaths by numbers\\" and \\"an unapologetically ‘pure’ genre entry, confronting – and amusing – us with all the sinister masked vicariousness of the Halloween spirit.\\" Cody Hamman of Arrow in the Head awarded the film a score of 8/10, calling it \\"a very simple film, providing 84 minutes of stalking and slashing that occurs largely within the confines of one location. Leone directs the hell out of that simple scenario, though, milking every possible bit of tension from each moment. It's a thrilling, brutal, gory '80s throwback that I recommend checking out, especially if you have a fondness for the same decade of films that this movie obviously holds in high regard.\\" Sol Harris of the magazine Starburst gave the film a score of 6/10, writing: \\"Presented as something of a throwback to horror B-movies of the '80s, Terrifier has far more style - both visually and audibly - than the average film of this nature. It's a surprisingly nice looking film for a movie about a clown chopping people into pieces.\\" Jeremy Aspinall of Radio Times praised the film, writing \\"But despite the unsparing gore, there's also plenty of atmosphere and a gnawing tension that's maintained all the way to the sequel-hinting climax.\\" The film was not without its detractors. Amyana Bartley of Film Inquiry.com felt that the film's script lacked both clear protagonists and depth, and wrote: \\"Art the Clown has the potential to be a formidable, gruesome, franchise horror character, he just needs more seasoning and cultivation.\\" Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed called it \\"fairly mediocre slasher fare\\", stating that the film lacked any creativity and tension, also criticizing the film's storyline. Vasquez concluded his review by stating \\"As a film Terrifier aims high, but feels like a very disposable party favor you'll have forgotten once the credits roll.\\" ===Accolades=== The film received three Fangoria Chainsaw Award nominations: Best Limited Release, Best Supporting Actor (Thornton), and Best Makeup FX (Leone). ==Sequels== In February 2019, Damien Leone stated that a sequel for Terrifier was in production, with the other sequel's script having already been written. The film went into production in October of 2019 with Fuzz on the Lens Productions as Co-Producers along with Dark Age Cinema. The film has delayed its final days of shooting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References* * Category:2016 films Category:2016 horror films Category:American films Category:American slasher films Category:American splatter films Category:English-language films Category:Fictional clowns Category:2010s slasher films Category:Horror films about clowns Category:Halloween horror films ","title":"Terrifier"},{"id":"56771753","text":"Blue Velvet is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2001 and released on the HighNote label.Jazz Depot: HighNote discography accessed March 7, 2018Payne, D.

He founded Nuriyya Islamic Institute in Tamale in 1969 and is the leader of Masjidul Bayaan in Tamale. He is widely considered to have been the initiator in transforming the traditional madrasas into Anglo-Arabic schooling and the pioneer of the creation of Ghana Islamic Education Unit. ==BiographyEarly life=== Ibrahim was born in Kumasi but took his initial studies in Takoradi at Khairiyya Islamic School. He was taught by Hajj Shuab, a renowned Dagomba Islamic scholar. Ibrahim was given the nod to teach his colleagues as an advanced student. Later, he moved to Kumasi to study under Sheikh Ahmad Nurideen. ===Coming to Tamale and Time at Anbariyya Islamic Institute === Shiekh Basha occasionally visited his uncle Yusuf Soalih Ajura also known as Afa Ajura in Tamale. However, in the 1950s, he stayed permanently with Afa Ajura in Tamale and started teaching at the Anbariyya Islamic Institute. Notable amongst his students was Sheikh Saeed Abubakr Zakaria who is currently the leader of the Anbariyya Islamic Institute. Basha later left to form his own school. ===Formation of Nuriyya Islamic Institute=== In the 1960s, Basha left Anbariyya Islamic Institute. Gow, Olonisakin, & Dijxhoorn (2013) cited the lessening of Afa Ajura's Wahhabi doctrine, difference in interpretation as well as the infusion of secular education as the main cause. Subsequently, he established Madrasat Nuriyya in 1969 now Nuriyya Islamic Institute. Nuriyya Islamic Institute became one of the first Islamic schools to be transformed from teaching only Arabic to Anglo-Arabic. ==Controversies== Ibrahim has been alleged as being a Tijaniyyah and a Shi'a. However, he denied those charges. In his own account; he asserted that although he was taught by a scholar who happens to have practiced Tijaniyyah, he never succumbed to its practice that strayed from traditional Sunni. Furthermore, on the issue of being a Shi'a, he claimed that he was a friend to Shi'as but never practiced their movement. Ibrahim is also alleged to be rival to the Anbariya Sunni Community as he has been severally accused of speaking against them in his sermons. == References == Category:1920s births Category:Living people Category:Ghanaian imams Category:Ghanaian Muslims Category:Ghanaian theologians Ibrahim, Basha Iddris Category:Sunni Muslim scholars ","title":"Ibrahim Basha"},{"id":"56771862","text":"Cecil Ray Morris (November 8, 1933 - September 12, 2001) was an American football coach and player.

Reality Sandwich calls Liberation Movement \\"a new collaborative music project that pushes the boundaries of human experience\\". Jambase described their 2013 Symbiosis Gathering performance as \\"one of the most moving, mind-blowing musical experiences in recent memory.\\" ==Formation== Liberation Movement was created among a wide variety of ambitious goals : \\"to bring greater appreciation for process\\", \\"to redefine the way our culture relates to age and wisdom\\", and \\"to truly generate the possibility of personal and collective evolution\\". Resurrector explains in an interview with Reality Sandwich: He says he chose the name because \\"speaking the name is a revolutionary potential in and of itself. Resurrector and Maestra Olivia Arévalo Lomas in Peru 2011 ==Peruvian Connection== In 2010, Resurrector \\"went to Peru to learn about how music and vibration are connected to shamanism\\". This led to him recording more than 25 indigenous singers from the Shipibo Tribe at the Temple Of The Way Of Light near Iquitos, Peru and produce and release the album Onáyabaon Bewá - Messages from Mother Earth by Shamans of the Temple of the Way of Light. This experience also led to a rebranding of Liberation Movement. In 2014, in collaboration with Peruvian-based NGO Alianza Arkana and the Rubin Foundation, he returned to Peru with bandmates Sasha Rose, Noah King and filmmakers Mitch Schultz (Writer/Director of DMT: The Spirit Molecule), Donald Schultz and Jason Gamble Harter to document a 3-week journey to the Peruvian Amazon. ===\\"Jiwexon Axebo\\" Concert in Pucallpa=== Liberation Movement teamed up with Alianza Arkana and ORAU (the regional political organization of the National Federation of Amazonian Indigenous Peoples) on a concert event held in Pucallpa, Peru called \\"Jiwexon Axebo\\" in the Shipibo Tribe's language and \\"Cultural Revival\\" in English.

She has an older sister named Emily. Kufrin graduated from Prior Lake High School in 2008, and obtained her Bachelor of Science degree in Mass Communications from Minnesota State University, Mankato in 2012. Her father died of brain cancer when Kufrin was 19 years old and her mother is a breast cancer survivor. ==Career== Before appearing on The Bachelor, she was working at Skyya Communications, a technology public relations agency based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ==Television showsThe Bachelor=== Kufrin was a contestant on Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of The Bachelor. After making it to the final 3, her ex- boyfriend Ross Jirgl showed up in Peru and proposed; Kufrin declined. She was initially chosen by Luyendyk as the winner and accepted his proposal at the end of the season. However, Luyendyk dumped Kufrin for the runner-up Lauren Burnham before the season finished airing. The break-up was filmed and the raw, unedited footage was shown on the first night of the two-night finale, a first for The Bachelor. Response After Luyendyk ended his engagement with Kufrin on air, Minnesota State Representative Drew Christensen proposed legislation to ban Luyendyk from the state of Minnesota. Additionally fans raised over $6,000 for Kufrin through the Venmo app, which Kufrin in turn donated to Stand Up to Cancer. Her donation was matched by ABC and later matched again by Katie Couric. The Bachelor season 20 lead, Ben Higgins, also pledged to donate the profits from each bag of coffee sold from his company for a 24-hour period. The day after the breakup aired, 12 billboards went up in Kufrin's hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as 4 in Los Angeles and 1 in Times Square, all showing their support for Kufrin and disgust at Luyendyk's actions. During the March 10, 2018 episode of Saturday Night Live, Cecily Strong portrayed Kufrin in the cold-open, parodying the break-up. ===The Bachelorette=== Kufrin was announced as the Bachelorette on March 6, 2018, on ABC's After the Final Rose special. The season premiered on May 25, 2018. In the end, Kufrin chose Garrett Yrigoyen over runner-up Blake Horstmann. During the finale, she and Yrigoyen were given a minivan from ABC as a gift. The couple were engaged and moved to Carlsbad, California, where they lived with their adopted corgi, Minno. On September 1, 2020, Kufrin and Yrigoyen announced the end of their engagement. ===Bachelor in Paradise=== Kufrin made a brief appearance during season five of Bachelor in Paradise to give advice to the girls and give closure to Colton Underwood. == References == Category:Living people Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:People from Prior Lake, Minnesota Category:Minnesota State University, Mankato alumni Category:American publicists Category:Bachelor Nation contestants Category:1990 births ","title":"Becca Kufrin"},{"id":"56772243","text":"Prince Eunsin (; January 11, 1755 – March 29, 1771) was a royal family member of the Joseon dynasty. His name was Yi Jin (), and he was by birth the fourth son of Crown Prince Sado and later the heir to Prince Yeonryeong, the younger half-brother of King Gyeongjong and Yeongjo. == Life == Prince Eunsin was the second illegitimate son of Crown Prince Sado, born to Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Buan Im clan. He was the younger brother of Prince Euneon and half- brother of Crown Prince Uiso, King Jeongjo, and Prince Eunjeon. In 1762, when his father was executed by King Yeongjo for treason, he was left unprotected and in poverty. He and his brother, Prince Euneon, had to borrow money from merchants and Hong Bong-han, the father of Crown Prince Sado's primary wife, and overtime the two gained a substantial debt. On February 2, 1771, King Yeongjo sent him to exile in Daejeong town in Jeju Island. On March 29, 1771, he became sick from an epidemic and died in Jeju, at the age of 16. Prince Eunsin married in 1769 to Lady Hong (1755-1829) of the Nanyang Hong clan, daughter of an official Hong Dae-hyeon; they had no issue. == Aftermath == As of 1776, according to the will of King Yeongjo, King Jeongjo, the prince's eldest brother, posthumously appointed him to be the heir to Prince Yeonryeong, who was his great uncle. Whereas being the successor of Prince Yeonryeong, Prince Eunsin was not regarded as the adopted son of Prince Nakcheon, who used to be the heir to Prince Yeonryeong but the status was deprived during the reign of Jeongjo (Page 24-25).

The movement had roots in the arts, literature, and science. Largely conceived as a reaction towards the extreme rationalism of the Enlightenment, it championed expressing emotions through aesthetic and emphasizing the transcendent allure of the natural world. There has been significant work done by historians about how romanticism played a significant role in the development of modern theories of evolution. Most notable is the work done by Robert J. Richards, a professor at the University of Chicago. Richards, and others, have contributed significantly to the conversation about how Romanticism plays a significant role in evolution theory, especially in regards to German Romanticism. == Alexander von Humboldt == Joseph Stieler, 1843) === Romantic contributions to Darwin's theory of evolution === Charles Darwin became acquainted with Humboldt's exploration and science during while studying at Cambridge. Here, Darwin was taken under the direction of John Stevens Henslow (1796–1861), Professor of Botany, who strongly encouraged Darwin to travel and study nature. Henslow also encouraged Darwin to read Alexander von Humboldt's manuscripts on exploring nature, and it was, at least in part, Humboldt's work that inspired Darwin's romantic notion of travel and discovery. Prior to Darwin's departure on the H.M.S. Beagle, Henslow bestowed to Darwin the English translation of Humboldt's Relation historique du voyage aux regions equinoxiales du nouveau continent, which the translator (Helen Maria Williams) called Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America. Darwin read Humboldt's Personal Narrative thoroughly while on his own journey of scientific exploration on board the Beagle.  Interactions through letters  Darwin and Humboldt spent their later years exchanging letters and manuscripts. After reading Darwin's writings from the Beagle, Humboldt wrote to Darwin: “You told me in your kind letter that, when you were young, the manner in which I studied and depicted nature in the torrid zones contributed toward exciting in you the ardor and desire to travel in distant lands. Considering the importance of your work, Sir, this may be the greatest success that my humble work could bring. Works are of value only if they give rise to better ones. The two men finally met in person in 1842. Humboldt died in 1859, sixth months before the first edition of On the Origin of Species was published. In letters to his close friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, Darwin reflected that his \\"whole course of life\\" was due to having read Humboldt's Personal Narrative and conclusively praised Humboldt as the \\"Greatest scientific traveller who ever lived.\\" === Romantic style in evolution theory === Historians have noted that Humboldt's vision of aesthetic appraisal and science was incredibly comprehensive and modern for his time: consequently, his work contributed to advancing observation in geography, geophysics, and natural history. It has also been noted that Darwin's aesthetic approach to the natural world through his explorations and consequent observations was influenced by Humboldt's excursions and literature. == Johann Wolfgang von Goethe == Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1779) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German Romantic poet, playwright, novelist, scientist, artist, and statesman whose works contributed significantly to natural history. === Romantic contributions to evolutionary science ===  Morphology  In 1790, Goethe wrote Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklären (Metamorphosis of Plants) and Zur Morphologie, creating the scientific field of morphology, the branch of study in biology that deals with the structural forms of organisms. In his texts, Goethe used morphology to describe homology between parts of different organisms (for example, comparing the arm of a human to the fin of a whale). Goethe further suggested that adaptive modifications in an organism's parts were all relative to a Bauplan, an idealized, common archetype. Robert J. Richards suggests that Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklären transformed biological sciences during this time period. Historian Joan Steigerwald suggests that Goethe's morphology was inherently Romantic, as they were idealistic. She also argues that Goethe's experiences with nature and aesthetics were the driving factors in his postulation of an \\"ideal\\" form (the Bauplan).  Legacy  Later evolutionists, including Carl Gegenbaur and Ernst Haeckel, used phenotypic variation first described by Goethe in his texts about morphology to advance the understanding of evolution. As a Romantic, Goethe also paved the way for equally influential Romantic-scientists, including Alexander von Humboldt and Friedrich Schelling. Professor Robert J. Richards of the University of Chicago argues that it was both the Romantic perspectives of Schelling and Goethe which paved the way for a nature-centric understanding of evolution. == Erasmus Darwin  Brief biography === Erasmus Darwin (by Joseph Wright, James Rawlinson and William Coffee) Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, was born in Nottinghamshire on 12 December 1731 and died on 18 April 1802. He was a successful physician, botanist, and poet who contributed heavily to evolution theory through his works as a writer-naturalist. Though he is most often linked to the Age of Enlightenment and was an enthusiastic proponent of Materialism, Erasmus Darwin's literary contributions popularized interest in the natural world, connecting him to the Romantic movement as well. === Naturalistic Poetry === In the late 1770s, Erasmus Darwin diverged from his work as a well-known physician due to his interest in botany. In 1789, he composed \\"The Love of Plants\\" which was a collection of poetic verses concerning Carolus Linnaeus's taxonomic system, which he revered deeply. This book was so successful that Erasmus Darwin later included it in The Botanic Garden (1791), which was composed of two poems, \\"The Economy of Vegetation\\" and \\"The Loves of Plants.\\" \\"The Economy of Vegetation\\" is focused on the evolution of mankind through technology and innovation and argues that industrialization was part of a single evolutionary process. Conversely, \\"The Loves of Plants\\" was focused on uniting nature with man through the appreciation of botany. In it, Darwin encourages humans to study botany because plants are a part of the same natural world as man. He also argues that sexual reproduction gives rise to phenotypic change (which his grandson would later incorporate into his own theory of evolution put forth in On the Origin of Species).266.974x266.974pxIn 1794, Erasmus Darwin also wrote Zoonomia, another book of verse, this time dealing with human physiology. In this volume, Erasmus Darwin presents himself as a Lamarckian evolutionist, advocating the \\"inheritance of acquired characteristics\\" theory. He also suggests a theory of pangenesis in the third volume of Zoonomia, a hypothesis Charles Darwin later propelled. The theories posited in Zoonomia are some of the first formal theories on evolution. === Erasmus Darwin's direct contributions to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution === Although Erasmus Darwin died seven years before Charles Darwin was born, the younger Darwin was not without his grandfather's teachings and works. Charles Darwin read Zoonomia when he was 18 years old and found it inspirational. Many topics that Erasmus Darwin wrote about stuck with Charles Darwin throughout his career as a naturalist: it has been noted that nearly every subject discussed in Zoonomia has an analogue in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. However, as Charles Darwin got older, he began to resent Erasmus Darwin's work. In the \\"short historical preface\\" of his 1860 publication of Origin, Darwin denounced Lamarck's belief in \\"a law of progressive development,\\" followed by a footnote: “It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of Lamarck in his Zoonomia'”. Erasmus Darwin, a proponent of Atheism, Materialism, and also provocative Romanticism, faced many obstacles in popularizing his views on evolution despite his success as a popular poet. Lamarck had faced similar dissent. Darwin wished to avoid this association, which could impede on his own popularity among the public and the scientific community. In 1879, Charles Darwin had become so polarized in his opinions about his grandfather that when wrote a biography on his grandfather titled The Life of Erasmus Darwin, it contained so much crudeness that Charles Darwin's daughter, Henriette Darwin, supposedly edited out 16% of the biography. ==References== Category:History of evolutionary biology Evolution ","title":"Romanticism in evolution theory"},{"id":"56772258","text":"Bernard Sinclair (1937 – 27 November 2015) was a French singer (baritone) particularly associated with the repertoire of the opéra comique and operetta, but also opera.

She was the first female graduate of a medical college in the state of Texas and one of the first female physicians to practice in Tarrant County. == Early life == Frances Daisy Emery was born September 5, 1876, in Kaufman County, Texas, to James Wallace and Elizabeth Brown Emery. James Wallace Emery had a master's degree from Bowdoin College and had been an outspoken abolitionist in the 1850s. The ninth of twelve children, four-year- old Daisy announced her intentions to become a doctor, a goal encouraged by her parents. The Emery family moved to Fort Worth when Daisy was fourteen years old. She attended Fort Worth public schools, where her father was also a teacher, and graduated from Fort Worth High School. == Medical Training and Career == Daisy Emery applied to and was initially refused admission to the medical college of Fort Worth University, but was admitted when she pointed out that no rules specifically excluded women from the school. She was thus admitted to the charter class of Fort Worth Medical College (also known as Fort Worth Medical School and Fort Worth School of Medicine) in 1894, where she was the only female student for a full year. In 1897 she graduated with honors, ranking second in a class of seventeen students. She had the distinction of being the first woman to graduate from a medical college in Texas. Dr. Emery worked in private practice in Fort Worth for two years, making her one of the first female physicians in the Tarrant County. She also worked as an evaluating physician for Penn Mutual Life Insurance's female applicants. In 1899, she moved to Washington, D.C. for postgraduate education. She lived with a married sister in Maryland while completing an internship and residency at Women and Children's Hospital in Washington. There she became involved in women's suffrage, developing an interest in women's voting rights, attending lectures by Susan B. Anthony and other activists, and even sewing her own bloomers. Dr. Daisy Emery returned to Texas in 1901 to care for her mother, who was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, and accepted a teaching position at Dallas Medical College. On November 30, 1903, Frances Daisy Emery married James Walter Allen, a classmate from Fort Worth Medical College with whom she had remained a relationship. Allen was a native of White Settlement, in western Tarrant County.The couple moved to Vinson, Oklahoma Territory, where Dr. Walter Allen had opened a medical practice, but were forced to again relocate when most of the town—including their home—was destroyed in a fire initially caused by a tornado. From 1904 to 1910, the couple shared a medical practice in the town of Content, in Runnels County, Texas, where they had an office with a small pharmacy adjoining their house. The rural setting required most of their practice to consist of house calls, first by horse and buggy, then bicycle, then motorcycle, and finally a small automobile. The Allens' first daughter, Frances Marion, was born during their time in Content. In 1910, the Allens moved their practice a few miles east to Goldsboro, Texas, where their second daughter, Sheila Emery, was born; in 1912, they relocated again to Newark, Texas, about 20 miles northwest of Fort Worth. In December 1913, the Allens were planning to move to China as missionaries when Walter died unexpectedly during surgery to remove kidney stones. Finding herself a widow at the age of 37, Dr. Daisy Emery Allen packed up her two young children and returned to Fort Worth. She served as clinical professor of children's diseases at Fort Worth Medical College until Fort Worth University closed in 1917 and its medical school, which had been chartered separately, merged with Baylor College of Medicine. She entered a practice with two male physicians in the Fort Worth National Bank building, then opened her own office serving women and children in the new Medical Arts Building in 1931. Dr. Daisy Emery Allen served on the staffs of Harris, All Saints, and St. Joseph hospitals in Fort Worth. She also treated patients at free clinics at City-County Hospital and the Wesley Center, where she delivered many of Fort Worth's babies. She was a founding member of the Fort Worth Academy of Medicine, a member of the Tarrant County Medical Society, the Tarrant County Association for Mental Health, the American Medical Women's Association, and was a life member of the Texas Medical Association. She was also an early member of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce. Dr. Daisy Emery Allen was a member of the League of Women Voters. She traveled extensively in the United States and Europe with her daughters and took them to political rallies. With her mother's influence, her daughter, Frances, became a social worker and pioneering advocate for child welfare in Texas and Illinois. == Retirement and Death == Dr. Frances Daisy Emery Allen retired from medicine in 1950, having practiced for more than half a century.

At her death, she owned extensive property in Runnels, Callahan, and Tarrant Counties, having accepted property in lieu of payment from patients.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as an El Paso County Commissioner from 2007 to 2011 and the El Paso County Judge from 2011 until 2017. ==Early life and education== Escobar is a native of El Paso, Texas, where she was born in 1969. She grew up near her family's dairy farm with her parents and four brothers. Escobar attended Loretto Academy and Burges High School, before getting her bachelor's degree at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and her master's degree from New York University. == Early political career == Escobar worked as a nonprofit executive and as Raymond Caballero's communications director when he was mayor of El Paso. When Caballero failed to get reelected, Escobar—along with Susie Byrd, attorney Steve Ortega and businessman Beto O'Rourke—considered entering public service; they started to discuss grassroots strategies with the goals of improving urban planning, creating a more diversified economy with more highly skilled jobs, as well as ending systemic corruption among city leadership. Escobar was elected as a County Commissioner of El Paso County in 2006 and as the County Judge of El Paso County in 2010. O’Rourke, Byrd and Ortega also all ran for office and won; they came to be collectively referred to as \\"The Progressives.\\" She also taught English and Chicano literature at UTEP and El Paso Community College. == U.S. House of Representatives  Elections === Escobar resigned from office in August 2017 to run full-time in the 2018 election to succeed Beto O'Rourke in the United States House of Representatives for . As the district is a solidly Democratic, majority- Hispanic district, whoever won the Democratic primary would be heavily favored in November. She won the six-way Democratic primary with 61 percent of the vote. In June 2018, Escobar (along with O'Rourke) led protests in Tornillo, Texas, of the Trump administration family separation policy that involved the separation of children of immigrant families. The city is just miles from the Rio Grande, the river that forms the border of the United States and Mexico in the state of Texas. The Trump administration had created a \\"tent-city\\" in Tornillo, where separated children were being held without their parents. O'Rourke called this practice \\"un-American\\" and the responsibility of all Americans. Escobar won the general election on November 6, defeating Republican Rick Seeberger. She became the first woman to represent the 16th. With her victory, Escobar and Sylvia Garcia became the first Latina congresswomen from Texas. Although the 16th has long been a majority-Hispanic district, Escobar is only the second Hispanic ever to represent it, the first being Silvestre Reyes, O'Rourke's predecessor. === Tenure === On November 13, 2019, Escobar was elected as a freshman class representative in a secret ballot by her peers, filling the role of Katie Hill, who had resigned from Congress. On February 4, 2020, Escobar delivered the Spanish-language response to President Trump's State of the Union Address. Her remarks touched on healthcare, immigration, the national debt, the importance of diversity, the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, wealth inequality, gun violence, and the United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement.

As a son of Marshal Chen Yi, he was one of China's most prominent princelings, or children of high officials. He held the rank of colonel when he quit his military and government posts in 1992 and entered business. His military background and princeling status helped his businesses expand to great sizes. He was an early director of privately held Anbang, which grew into an insurance giant. In 2013, he made national headlines when he publicly confessed and apologized for torturing and persecuting his teachers during the Cultural Revolution. He has been called the \\"conscience\\" of princelings. == Early life == Chen was born on 30 July 1946 in the Yi-Meng Mountains in Linyi, Shandong, where his father Chen Yi was the commander of the Shandong Field Army during the Chinese Civil War. He was the youngest of Chen Yi's three sons and his name Xiaolu was from the Confucian classic text Mencius. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Chen Yi served as Mayor of Shanghai and Commander of the East China Military Region, and Xiaolu spent his early school years in Nanjing and Shanghai. When he was eight, his father was appointed Vice Premier and his family moved to Beijing, where he studied at Beijing No. 4 High School and Beijing No. 8 High School. == Cultural Revolution == When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Chen joined the Red Guards and tortured and persecuted his teachers. He later confessed that he participated in organizing public struggle sessions against the teachers which often turned violent. He told Jane Perlez of The New York Times that the school's party chief, Hua Jia, committed suicide after being imprisoned in a storeroom and beaten for two weeks. She had been a party member for 30 years. When more radical groups began to attack Communist Party leaders, Chen organized the \\"Beijing Xicheng District Red Guard Picket Corps\\" to defend the leaders such as his father. When Chen Yi, then serving as Foreign Minister of China, criticized the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong sidelined him and the Red Guards occupied the Foreign Ministry. Premier Zhou Enlai sent Chen Xiaolu to the army for his safety. === Public apologies === In 2013, before the 50th anniversary of the Cultural Revolution, Chen issued a public apology to the teachers he and his classmates tortured. As president of the alumni association of Beijing No. 8 High School, he posted the following message on the alumni website: > As a student leader at Number Eight Middle School and the director of the > school's Revolutionary Committee, I bear direct responsibility for the > denouncing and criticism of school leaders, some teachers and students. In > the early stages of the movement, I actively rebelled and organized the > denouncements of school leaders. Later on when I served as the director of > the school's Revolutionary Committee, I wasn't brave enough to stop the > inhumane persecutions, because I feared I would be accused of protecting the > old ways and being counter-revolutionary. He explained that he was worried about the recent trend in China to reverse the repudiation of the Cultural Revolution, and concluded: \\"My official apology comes too late, but for the purification of the soul, the progress of society, the future of the nation, one must make this kind of apology.\\" In October 2013, he apologized to his old teachers again in person when he visited the No. 8 School for an alumni reunion. Chen's public apology made headlines nationwide and caused much online debate over the Cultural Revolution. Many praised him, but others criticized him for \\"picking over old wounds\\". Historian Xu Youyu considers his apology \\"very unusual\\", as former Red Guards generally describe themselves as victims of the Cultural Revolution and de-emphasize their own wrongdoings. Chen has been called the \\"conscience\\" of princelings. == Career == After the Cultural Revolution, Chen worked for a few years as an assistant defence attaché in the Chinese embassy in London, before returning to China in 1985. He subsequently worked for the liberal Central Office for Political Structure Reform under Bao Tong, assistant to the reformist leader Zhao Ziyang, and called for the establishment of independent workers' unions. The proposed political reforms were aborted after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the subsequent crackdown. Chen, then with the rank of colonel, left the government and the military in 1992. Chen went into business after leaving the government, and his princeling status and military background helped his businesses expand to \\"staggering\\" sizes. He was an early director of Anbang, founded by Wu Xiaohui, which grew from a small car dealer and insurance company into an insurance giant and bought the iconic Waldorf Astoria New York Hotel in 2014. However, Chen said he was merely an advisor and not a shareholder. == Personal life == In 1975, Chen married Su Huining (粟惠宁), the daughter of General Su Yu, Marshal Chen Yi's second in command. == Death == On 28 February 2018, Chen died in Hainan following a heart attack, at the age of 71. == References == Category:1946 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Red Guards Category:Businesspeople from Shandong Category:People's Liberation Army personnel Category:Chinese colonels Category:People from Linyi Category:Anbang people Category:20th-century Chinese military personnel Category:21st-century Chinese military personnel Category:20th-century Chinese businesspeople Category:21st-century Chinese businesspeople ","title":"Chen Xiaolu"},{"id":"56772465","text":"Rise is a Canadian documentary television series, which aired on Viceland and APTN in 2017.\\"Viceland’s ‘Rise’ Relives the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests\\".

While many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date.

Sellers, 584 U.S. ___ (2018), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning whether a federal court sitting in a habeas corpus proceeding should \\"look through\\" a summary ruling to review the last reasoned decision by a state court. In 1997, a Georgia jury convicted Marion Wilson of murder and sentenced him to death. In December 1999, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed on direct appeal. Wilson next petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. The petition was denied in a written opinion by the state superior court, which was summarily affirmed by the state supreme court, and denied review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Wilson then filed another petition for habeas corpus, now in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, which was denied. In December 2014, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, also rejecting Wilson's petition. In August 2016, the full en banc Eleventh Circuit again rejected the petition by a vote of 6–5, with Circuit Judge William H. Pryor Jr. writing for the majority and Circuit Judges Adalberto Jordan and Jill A. Pryor writing dissents. The Court announced judgment in favor of the prisoner on April 17, 2018, reversing and remanding to the lower court by a vote of 6–3. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. The Court held that the circuit had erred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by failing to consider the reasoning in the lower, earlier, written, state court opinion. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented. In August 2018, the Eleventh Circuit again denied Wilson's petition, in another opinion by Judge Pryor. Wilson was executed by lethal injection on June 20, 2019. ==ReferencesCase page at SCOTUSblog Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2018 in United States case law ","title":"Wilson v.

There is a melancholy, heartbreaking quality to these tracks. ... The journeyman's warm, burnished tenor sound veritably weeps and more often soars ... Much like the singer Person knew, To Etta With Love is an understated, moving, and swinging elegy\\". On All About Jazz, John Kelman noted \\"In a career filled with highs, one thing that made Jones and Person so well-known was their commitment to playing in smaller neighbourhood clubs that others would pass by. With To Etta With Love Person delivers a bittersweet love letter that has all the dusky ambience of one of those dimly-lit establishments ... it's vital that younger listeners be aware of the vibrant history that has brought jazz to where it is today.

His name was Yi Ohn () while he was originally named Yi Soosin (); his courtesy name was \\"Onjung\\" (). Prince Nakcheon was by birth the only son of Yi Chae (), and he later became an adoptive son of late Prince Yeollyeong in 1734. ==Biography Life === The gravestone of Prince Nackcheon Prince Nakcheon was born as the only son of Yi Chae and Lady Yu of the Jinju Yu clan (daughter of Yu Man-jung). Through Yi Chae, he was a 4-great-grandson of Prince Gyeongchang (9th son of King Seonjo) (p. 24-25). Prior to the adoption, Prince Yeollyeong, the youngest son of King Sukjong, died without issue in 1719; therefore, a descendant of Crown Prince Sohyeon became Prince Yeollyeong's heir in the same year, and was later known as Yi Gong, Prince Sangwon (; 1715-1733) as of 1727. However, Prince Sangwon's birth family got involved in the Musin Revolt in 1728; as a relative to a \\"criminal\\", Sangwon himself died unmarried in 1733 and he had no issue, the adoption relationship was soon annulled in the same year as well. And so, King Yeongjo asked the officials to seek another heir for his late brother. Later, among some of the king's closest relatives, Yeongjo was impressed by Yi Soosin, the son of Yi Chae; it was soon decided that Yi Soosin was to be the heir to Prince Yeollyeong and, as he was aged enough, he was eligible to receive the royal title, in 1734. In the same year, Yi Soosin's name was changed to \\"Yi Ohn\\" and received the title, Prince Nakcheon. Around 1735 to 1737, Yeongjo decided to find a bride for his nephew, and daughters from some of the officials, including Kim Chi-man () and Seo Jong-su (; 1678–1744 (Volume 1, Page 150)) from noble families, were chosen, but they both refused to have their daughter marry the prince; both of them were imprisoned by the order of Yeongjo and Lady Seo married Prince Nakcheon in 1737. Lady Seo was a great-great-granddaughter of Princess Jeongsin, the eldest daughter of King Seonjo; the couple had no children. After he married, Prince Nakcheon died suddenly in the same year, aged 16. After his death, Prince Nakcheon was buried in the family graveyard at Geumcheon of Gyeonggi Province (now Siheung County, Gyeonggi Province), near to his adoptive parents and grandmother's burial (Page 87)번당리에 있었던 연령군묘(延齡君墓) . === Heir === On October 7, 1747, King Yeongjo ordered Yi Cheol-hai (), a 7-great-grandson of Deokheung Daewongun (7th son of King Jungjong and the father of Seonjo) and the second son of Yi Hyeong-jong (), to be the heir to Prince Nakcheon under a new name and title, Yi Yeong, Prince Dalseon (; December 20, 1731 – January 16, 1749) (Page 36-38). During the process, the Grand Queen Dowager (Queen Inwon, the king's stepmother) commented that the adoptee would become her great-grandson and she hoped to choose another closer relative instead. The adoption ended shortly later, as Lady Seo treated poorly to his adopted son and daughter-in-law, eventually causing Prince Dalseon committed suicide by poisoning himself in 1749; after his death, the adoption relationship between Nakcheon and Dalseon was annulled in 1750.대신과 비국 당상을 인견하고, 달선군의 파양·성이홍에의 부조 등을 명하다 As King Jeongjo succeeded to the throne in 1776, Prince Eunsin, the new king's late half- brother, was appointed to be the new heir to Prince Yeollyeong, but not as an heir to Prince Nakcheon. The status of Prince Nakcheon being the adopted son of Prince Yeollyeong was also annulled during Jeongjo's reign (Page 24-25). In 1819, during the reign of Sunjo, some officials suggested making either Prince Eunsin or another relative to be the heir to Prince Nakcheon, but the proposal was not approved. During the time of Korea under Japanese rule in 1940, the graves of Prince Nakcheon and his family were moved to Yesan County in South Chungcheong Province, as Keijō (now Seoul) was under a land consolidation. == See also == * Prince Yeollyeong * Prince Eunsin * Prince Namyeon * Prince Kyeongchang * Heungseon Daewongun ==References== Category:Joseon Dynasty people Category:18th-century Korean people Category:1720 births Category:1737 deaths Category:House of Yi Category:Korean princes ","title":"Prince Nakcheon"},{"id":"56772664","text":"Mary Ann Monroe (March 7, 1860 - September 11, 1953) was a prominent teacher and school administrator in Spokane, Washington, and an active figure in education across the state of Washington. She was the first woman to serve as president of the Washington Education Association and the first woman on the board of trustees at the State Normal School at Cheney. She ran unsuccessfully for the office of Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1912, but was active in civic and state politics in the early 20th century. ==Early life and education== Monroe was born on March 7, 1860 in Newark, Ohio. She was born to mother Catherine Thyrer and father John Simpson. Her mother was from Germany, and her father, John Simpson, was from England. She had a sister. Monroe received her education in a city normal school, and went to college at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, although she did not receive her degree from Denison. She completed her education degree at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. In 1889, Monroe came to Spokane, Washington, and soon after she began employment at the Lincoln School (a public elementary school) as a teacher. ==Career== Monroe began teaching at the Lincoln School in Spokane in 1889. The school at that time held classes in the basement of a Unitarian Church. The school was soon relocated to its own building, which she later described in a letter to a friend as a brick building with four classrooms on what is now Cowley Street. The school's location made her work more challenging—as Monroe explained in her letters, the building had no running water initially, and the absence of graded streets in the early 1890s made access to the school difficult: \\"The teachers and students waded through snow, mud, and water in rubber boots.\\" Monroe taught at the school for several years before being promoted to service as the building's principal, a job she held at the Lincoln School from 1893 until 1928. Among the major challenges she faced as principal was leading the school through rebuilding from catastrophic fires in 1903 and 1926. Monroe was also active beyond the confines of the Lincoln School, working for public education. She was involved in the Washington Education Association from its earliest days, and is recorded as a presenter at the association's state conference in 1898. In January 1905, she was appointed to the library committee for the Spokane city schools by then school board president Warren W. Tolman. ===1912 campaign for State Superintendent=== In 1912, Monroe ran as the Democratic nominee for state school superintendent, advocating a policy of \\"progression and modern ideas.\\" Despite her identification as a Democrat, one newspaper remarked on the existence of \\"a non-partisan club of women\\" that organized specifically to assist with her campaign, which included both Progressive and Republican women in the club's leadership. Monroe's platform aimed to make education more directly related to the everyday lives of students. Rural Washington schools, in Monroe's view, needed to focus on agriculture and domestic science for the future housewife, with \\"a closer relation between the farm and the school.\\" For urban students, Monroe favored manual training departments, and school and home gardens. For all students, regardless of location, she advocated for citizenship education. In the general election, Monroe placed third statewide with 72,916 votes—a relatively close loss in a three-way race against C.E. Beach, the Progressive nominee, who received 86,396 votes, and the winner, Republican nominee Josephine Corliss Preston, who received 96,756 votes. ===Trustee=== On April 26, 1913, the Colville Examiner published appointments made by Governor Ernest Lister. The article announced Monroe as a \\"trustee [for the] Cheney normal school.\\" She was the first woman to serve on the normal school's board of trustees. When the normal school's main building was rebuilt following the 1912 fire, Monroe as chair of the board of trustees gave the opening address at the dedication of the new building (now Showalter Hall) on May 22, 1915. On February 4, 1916, Monroe was present at the dedication of another new building—the school's first dormitory—when it was named Monroe Hall in her honor. She was the guest of honor on the occasion, and was invited to kindle the first fire in the hall's main fireplace: she made some brief remarks about \\"the various ways in which a woman's residence hall could have a salutary influence on girls coming from many different environments.\\"Dryden (1965), pp. 127-129. She fulfilled the same office on July 9, 1920, kindling the first fire at the campus's second dormitory, Senior Hall: she then remarked \\"It is the wish of the friends of the girls of Senior Hall that the fireplace may scatter its light, radiate its heat, and bring good cheer to future occupants of this beautiful home.\\"Dryden (1965), pp. 130-131. Another of her public duties was handing diplomas to graduates at the commencement ceremony. In addition to her duties as a trustee, Monroe visited with the students of the Normal School. In June 1918, she spent the weekend as a guest in Monroe Hall. Monroe was also a regular guest at senior class dinners. In 1924, all the trustees, including Monroe, were honored with a dinner. While visiting Ohio in the summer of 1921, Monroe purchased two vases to decorate Monroe Hall. ===Political activism=== Monroe was active in public service and civic engagement throughout her life. She was the first woman teacher in Spokane to testify in court regarding the enforcement of the city's truancy law. In 1913, Monroe was elected as the incoming president of the Washington Education Association (WEA), while still remaining a school principal in the Spokane Public Schools; she was the first woman president of the WEA, and only the second woman in the United States to serve as president of a state educational association. Monroe remained active in Democratic party politics after her 1912 run for State Superintendent. She was one of four women named as delegates to the 1916 Democratic National Convention that re-nominated Woodrow Wilson (Monroe was an at-large delegate). In 1920, Monroe was appointed to a \\"Democratic Platform Committee\\" for the Washington State Democratic Party, which was chaired by Preston M. Troy. Later in life, Monroe served as an officer in the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane's Women's Auxiliary: she is listed as the president of that organization in 1931. She also served on Spokane's municipal parks board, chairing the recreation committee at one point: in that capacity, she assisted with the training of teachers facilitated by the Works Progress Administration in 1936. ==Personal life== Reports vary as to when Monroe married William Allison Monroe: in her obituary, it claims they were married in 1884, whereas William Allison Monroe's obituary claims they were married in 1886. The couple had no children. In 1889, they moved from Newark, Ohio, to Seattle, Washington, and shortly after the Great Fire on August 4, 1889, they moved to Spokane. William A. Monroe was a well-known engineer and accountant. Soon after they came to Spokane, he became a deputy city auditor, working with Theodore Reed. After about a decade and a half, he joined Winter, Parsons & Boomer, railway contractors, quickly becoming a manager of that company, which built many railways, dams, and other projects throughout the western United States. He died of a stroke at the age of 79, on March 13, 1940, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane. According to the Spokane Press, Monroe, when she was principal of the Lincoln School, woke up to a burglar in her home one evening. She screamed and frightened the burglar, who the Press noted was \\"probably more scared than she [was]\\": the police were called and nothing was reported stolen. Monroe died at the age of 93 on September 11, 1953, at the Jane O'Brien Sanitarium in Spokane, from chronic myocardial degeneration. She is buried at Greenwood Memorial Terrace in Spokane. ==References *Spokane Historical's article on Monroe Hall Category:1860 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Newark, Ohio Category:People from Spokane, Washington Category:Denison University alumni Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Washington (state) Democrats Category:Women in Washington (state) politics Category:Educators from Washington (state) Category:American women educators Category:American school administrators Category:Trustees of educational establishments Category:Educators from Ohio ","title":"Mary A.

He was one of the founders of the Thermophysics research school in the USSR. == Biography == Leonid Mikhailovich Biberman graduated from Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) in 1940, specializing in Electro-Vacuum technology. In January 1941 he entered the postgraduate course of Moscow Power Engineering Institute. His scientific advisor was Valentin Fabrikant. He fought in Great Patriotic War from 1941 to 1945 in the rank of Technician-Lieutenant, and was the head of the workshop of a communications battalion. In 1945, he was reinstated in the post-graduate course of Moscow Power Engineering Institute and began teaching part-time there at the Department of Physics. Since 1946, he had been a Consultant of the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute. Candidate of Science (1946), Doctor of Science (1959). In the second half of the 1950s, Leonid Biberman took on a complicated physicotechnical problem: the development of the theory of radiative heat transfer. In 1955–1957 Biberman managed to show in his papers that when a space vehicle moves through dense layers of the atmosphere, the shock wave radiation in front of the apparatus generates a significant, and at high velocities, the principal contribution to aerodynamic heating. The results of this research were used in calculations for the thermal insulation of Soviet space vehicles. In 1966 he started working at Joint Institute for High Temperatures. He substantiated the establishment of a high-temperature research group, which became the basis of the Theoretical Division of the Institute of High Temperatures of the USSR Academy of Sciences. This scientific school was later named after him. He was a scientific advisor of more than 20 Doctors of Sciences.МЭИ: история, люди, годы: сборник воспоминаний. В 3-х т. Т.1. Апаров Б.

Then called the Women's Center, its first director was Dr. Pat Coontz. The Center was part of the Women's Program, which coordinated the activities of an academic program for Women's Studies with the Center's programming for Eastern Washington University students, faculty, staff, and the greater Cheney community. Pat Coontz also created the Women's Center to break the stigma of women being viewed in the role of wife and mother, and to create an empowering environment to be recognized as a powerful leader in her community. ==History of the Center== As the name of the Center suggests, its intention was to support research in women's studies. In addition to supporting scholarship, discussions, counseling, and lectures were on the agenda. In the student newspaper's \\"Faculty Forum\\" column on January 19, 1978, Pat Coontz shot down the \\"Women's Libber\\" stereotype, noting that extremist views were not characteristic of the majority of feminists. She then called out her male colleagues for contributing to a sexist campus culture. These colleagues, were \\"good union men, interested in a better future for everyone\\" yet referred to their \\"Farrah Fawcett-looking students\\" as \\"chicks\\" and \\"dolls.\\" The Center's name has changed over time: originally the Women's Center from the fall of 1977 until about June 1989,EWU Women's Center Flier, May/June 1989. EWU Publications - Women's Center. EWU Archives & Special Collections, Cheney, WA. it was renamed the EWU Women Studies Center in September 1989.EWU Women Studies Center Flier, September/October 1989. EWU Publications - Women's Center. EWU Archives & Special Collections, Cheney, WA. It received its current name, the Women's and Gender Education Center, in the fall of 2017. The main objective of the center is to provide an area for women and non-binary identities with resources and the opportunity to promote in- depth academic and scholarly research on issues relating to women and gender. Ultimately a main goal of the WAGE Center is to educate people about women's status, lend assistance in cases of discrimination, and support the strengthening of women's ideals. ==Programs and activities== Annually, the Women's & Gender Studies Program hosts Contemporary Issues in Feminist Research presentation series in which faculty present research in their discipline from a feminist perspective. The Women's Studies Challenge to Tradition was a four day conference, starting May 4, 1978 to May 7, 1978, that brought together members of the general public and scholars from the Northwest to discuss research and developments in women's studies. The keynote speaker for the symposium was Fanny Howe, who spoke on the need to reexamine curricula biased toward a male perspective. There were 15 panels and workshops that discussed different topics such as women under stress, women and work in a technological age, women and politics, history's lost achievements, women in the arts and sciences, the language of sexism, single parent families and the impact of feminism on the church. In 1986 from October 17–19, Eastern hosted the Northwest Women's Studies Association Conference, featuring keynote speaker and contemporary feminist Nawal El-Saadawi. The H.O.M.E. (Helping Ourselves Means Education) Program is a self-help network that provides resources for students who are typically low-income parents. H.O.M.E. connects students to a network of volunteer staff, faculty, and administrators. On October 17–19, 1986, a conference was held and it dealt with the energy of women in building and giving birth to their communities on a local level, as well as nationally and internationally. Programs offered in the spring quarter of 1977 were sexism in counseling, women in art, racism and sexism, and women and social reform. Currently, The Women's and Gender Education Center offers a bi-annual leadership seminar to the students of Eastern Washington University. This one day seminar, including local community leaders, celebrates the successes and challenges of women in and around Spokane. This seminar allows ideas to bloom in a safe environment and vital connections are made. The WAGE Center continually connects women to resources within the University and out in the local area. ==Directors of Women's Studies and Women's and Gender Studies Program and Managers of the CenterDirectors of Women's Studies and Women's and Gender Studies=== *Pat Coontz (1977-1983) *Joan Niemann, Interim Director during Coontz's sabbatical (1980-1981) *Lisa Brown, Acting Director (1983)Memorandum to the Friends of the Women's Center from Lee Swedberg, 15 September 1983, Women's Center Publications, EWU University Archives and Special Collections *Lee Swedberg (1983-1998) *Sally Winkle (1998-2018) *Judy Rohrer (2018-) ===Managers=== *Sherrie Holland (1983) *Margaret Craford (1983-1984) *Chris Jacox (1984-1990) *Carol Vines (1990-2015) *Lisa Logan (2015-) ==References *WAGE Center news and publications Category:Student activity centers in the United States Category:Eastern Washington University Category:1977 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Women's and Gender Education Center (Eastern Washington University)"},{"id":"56772749","text":"Joe Byler (August 25, 1922 – May 5, 1994) was an American football tackle.

Taking their time, savoring sturdy melodies and ingenious changes, allowing the sheer beauty of their respective tones to score major points, letting offhand virtuosity speak for itself, this duo practically luxuriates in generous music-making ... A swing-to-bop stylist now in the golden age of his artistic maturity, Person couldn't sound more relaxed, more willing to impart emotion through the warmth of his sound and the judicious construction of a perfectly devised phrase.

Throughout the 1580s, Ali Beg reportedly led several expeditions in the attempt of the Ottoman Empire to contest the Portuguese control of the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean down the Eastern Coast of Africa. He began this chain of expeditions in 1581, when he raided the Portuguese controlled city of Muscat, Oman, which appears to have been a resounding success. From there he would begin making his way down the Eastern African Coast, reaching the Kenyan city of Malindi by 1585. Ali Beg would return from his first expedition to the Swahili Coast in 1586 resoundingly successful, having \\"managed to secure the allegiance of every major Swahili port town except Malindi, to capture three fully laden Portuguese vessels, and to return safely to Mocha with some 150,000 cruzados of booty and nearly sixty Portuguese prisoners.\\" However, the success of Mir Ali Beg's expeditions were widely kept a secret from the general Ottoman government, because three government members: Hasan Pasha, Kilich Ali Pasha, and Hazinedar Sinan Pasha, had hatched a conspiracy to gain more funding for naval expeditions by lying to the central government about an exaggerated Portuguese threat. Because news of Ali Beg's success would suggest that they were already in control of the sea, and thus would need no new funding, they kept it to themselves. However, this would come back to haunt them as in 1588 the Swahili people would arrive in Yemen requesting aid from the Portuguese fleet, and Hasan Pasha would have no credibility on which to ask for government funding or assistance, forcing him to send Mir Ali Beg back with just his same small fleet of five ships and 300 men. This would ultimately cost Ali Beg and the Ottomans, with his fleet being defeated in 1589 in Mombasa not only by the Portuguese but also a surprise third faction of supposed Zimba cannibals that ambushed them during battle. Mir Ali Beg would surrender to the Portuguese fleet and be taken captive along with much of his crew. He would then be sent to Goa and later Lisbon where he would convert to Christianity and live for the remainder of his life. == First voyage to the Swahili coast == In 1583, Hasan Pasha exaggerated the significance of the arrest of a Spanish spy, and warned the Sultan that the Ottoman defenses in the Indian Ocean were not adequate to ward off a Portuguese invasion. In response, Sultan Murad III sent 2 galleots from Suez to Yemen in order to aid in defense. However, instead of using the ships for defense, Hasan Pasha gave them to Mir Ali Beg and sent the fleet to raid the Portuguese controlled Swahili coast, but also to establish connections with the local Muslim population and choose the location of a new Ottoman naval base for future raids and the eventual conquest of the Swahili coast. however, on their way out of Yemen, one of the galleots had to turn back. Mir Ali thus began his journey to the Swahili coast with a single galleot and 80 men. The Portuguese were so unpopular among the local people that upon arriving in Mogadishu and explaining why he was visiting, the people of Mogadishu immediately declared allegiance to Murad III, contributed funding and 20 armed coastal ships as an escort to the expedition. Mir Ali received similarly enthusiastic support from his visits of other towns along the coast. The Portuguese were unprepared for Mir Ali Beg's arrival. Ruy Lopes Salgado, the captain responsible for defending the Swahili coast, chose to hide in Malindi rather than attempt to stop the privateer. Mir Ali Beg had free rein of the coast. Shortly thereafter, he captured a merchant ship from Diu without a fight, and the people of Lamu turned over Captain-Major Roque de Brito and his warship, the crew of which he promptly replaced with Muslim volunteers, and used to capture another Portuguese ship. Mir Ali and his fleet spent the next month gaining support from the local Muslim people along the coast, and returned to Mocha with a fleet of 24 ships, plunder worth 150,000 gold cruzados (Portuguese currency), and 60 Portuguese captives. == Battle of Mombasa == In the Spring of 1589, Mir Ali Beg arrived in Mombasa to prepare for the oncoming Portuguese attack. Because of his previous successful expedition to Mombasa, the locals were welcoming of him and his fleet and supported them in the preparations for the battle. Although Ali Beg only had five galleots and approximately 300 men under his control to combat the strong Portuguese fleet, he was also given a large amount of artillery to use on land. With the assistance of the locals, in just a few weeks he prepared his defense of the harbor which included a tower with artillery mounts, as well as his own fleet. Though this was a strong defensive position for Mir Ali Beg, it was only so to an invasion from the sea. And while this was exactly what the Portuguese had planned to do, no one could have accounted for the surprise third party that ultimately decided the battle. Record says that on the day of the battle, up to 20,000 members of a supposed cannibal Zimba tribe ambushed Ali Beg's men and the town of Mombasa causing the battle to essentially be over by the time the Portuguese, led by commander Tomé De Souza Coutinho, arrived to the harbor. While the Ottomans would briefly attempt to fire at the Portuguese, they were so overwhelmed by the Zimba on land that they could do little to resist the Portuguese from simply overpowering the remainder of their fortifications. Mir Ali Beg would seek refuge inland for a couple of days while the Portuguese remained hesitant to leave the harbor, but that would change when the Zimba chief talked to the Portuguese commander and declared an alliance, prompting De Souza Coutinho to immediately head to capture Ali Beg and his men. The Zimba were still aiming to kill the Ottomans and Mombasans, and chased Ali Beg and his men all the way to the shore until he plunged into the sea to be taken captive by the Portuguese along with a small number of his men and Mombasans. Ali Beg appeared relieved to be captured by the Portuguese as opposed to the Zimba, saying, \\"I do not lament my adverse fortune, for such is the nature of war, and I would much rather be a captive of the Christians, as I was once before in Spain, than food for the barbarous and inhuman Zimba.” After his defeat and subsequent capture in March 1589, Mir Ali Beg was taken to Lisbon where he would convert to Christianity and change his name to Francisco Julião, and live out his days as a prisoner. == Identity of the \\"Zimba\\" == The identity of Zimba remains unknown. Even their name is uncertain, as the name is attributed to them by the Portuguese (indeed it was a term often ascribed to a variety of bellicose groups during the period). Allegedly they were a cannibal tribe, but it has also been suggested this may have just been an embellishment by Europeans, who tended to ascribe cannibalistic tendencies to African tribes during this time period. It has been suggested they could have been anything from a migrating Maravi warriors to a mercenary army hired by discontented Mombasans or perhaps a local group that preferred Portuguese influence to that of Ottoman interlopers.Casale, Giancarlo. \\"Global politics in the 1580s: One canal, twenty thousand cannibals, and an Ottoman plot to rule the world.\\" Journal of World History (2007): 267-296. The elusive identity of the group has caused some historians to even go so far as to suggest they were a fiction created by Portuguese writers. However Giancarlo Casale argues that this is a mistaken viewpoint, arguing that while the identity of the Zimba is unknown, it is undeniable that some third party did show up in force at the battle. Casale argues that if they were fictional, it is not clear why the Portuguese would make them up; the Ottomans' conflicts with Christendom made them an opponent par excellence for any Portuguese noble at the time and Portugal wanted to prove her actions in the Indian Ocean against the Ottoman Empire were equal to those of any European state in the Mediterranean. Portuguese chroniclers were more likely to exaggerate their countrymen's role, rather than downplay it. Thus Casale argues that it makes no sense for the Portuguese to invent a fictional force that suddenly intervenes in the conflict at a critical moment and deprives the Portuguese forces of credit for their victory. Thus in Casale's view, while the identity and even name of the Zimba may be uncertain, it is highly likely that some third party did intervene during the battle.Casale, Giancarlo. \\"Global politics in the 1580s: One canal, twenty thousand cannibals, and an Ottoman plot to rule the world.\\" Journal of World History (2007): 267-296. == Legacy == Mir Ali Beg was a prominent figure in the Ottoman history of expansion in the Indian Ocean. His early voyages marked some of the first contentions to Portuguese control of the area by the Ottoman Empire, and his defeat at Mombasa in 1589 would mark the end of the Ottomans attempts to contest to the Portuguese the Indian Ocean for the rest of their history. == References == Category:16th-century pirates ","title":"Mir Ali Beg"},{"id":"56773048","text":"Steelville is an unincorporated community in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. According to the 2016 census, the town has not been included in past census counts because the town is so small. It lies next to the Octoraro Creek: the border line between Lancaster County and Chester County. ==History== Steelville occupies land adjacent to Atglen, Pennsylvania which used to be wilderness. Native Americans roamed the land during this time, and primarily used trails such as the Great Minquas Path to access trade routes and trade with the English settlers. In 1875 the borough of Atglen was established and now includes Steelville. The town is also a member of West Fallowfield Township that was developed in 1878. A few organized religious groups began developing in the surrounding area including the Presbyterians. Presbyterian churches and Quaker meeting houses began to form. A few families from these religious groups formed the town of Steelville, as the English began to settle most of what is now the East Coast, United States. One of these families was the family of William Steele who settled in Steelville in 1750. He resided here in 1814 where he had a son, Franklin Steele. ==Geography== Steelville is located at (latitude, longitude).

Noémi Pernessin Raymond (also spelled Noemi; June 23, 1889 - August 19, 1980) was a French-born American artist and designer who spent much of her career in Japan. Her work included painting, sculpture, graphic design and illustration, furniture, rug and textile design as well as interior design. == Biography == Born in Cannes, France, she moved to New York with her family around age 12. She graduated from Columbia University where she studied under John Dewey and Arthur Wesley Dow who introduced her to Japanese art and design. She later studied painting at the École de la Grande Chaumiere in Paris. As World War I threatened, she returned to America. On the voyage in August, 1914, she met Czech-born Antonin Raymond who became her design partner and husband. They married in NYC on December 13, 1914. It was her art-world connections which led to her and Antonin working for Frank Lloyd Wright from May-December, 1916. Noémi and Antonin worked with Wright at Taliesin and, after Antonin was discharged from the US army at the end of WWI, accompanied Wright to Japan in 1919 to work on the design of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. After leaving the Imperial Hotel project in 1921, Noémi and her husband remained and worked in Japan until 1938; they returned again after World War II, working in Japan from 1947 or 1948 to 1973. == Designs == Together Noémi and her husband worked together on over 500 structures in Japan, India, South East Asia, Europe and the United States, including houses, schools, factories, embassies, churches, etc. Committed modernists, their style combined modern European design with international folk craft traditions. She and Antonin gained recognition as one of the earliest practitioners of the International Style in Asia. Trained as an artists/designer, Noémi's interest in 3-D design grew as she worked with her architect husband. In 1916, while working with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesen, she realized the importance that furnishings played in manipulating space along with knitting together structures. Noémi went on to design the interiors of many of Antonin’s architectural projects. While living in Japan in the 1920s, she learned about Japanese craft working as an export broker for various Japanese goods such as lacquerware, ceramics, baskets, and textiles. She worked with Mita Heibonji who taught her the techniques of wood block printing and sumi-e calligraphy as well as an appreciation for folk art, which complemented the Raymonds interest in Japanese rural farmhouse (minka). Noémi Pernessin Raymond, Imperial Palace Moat, woodblock print, ca. 1920s == Work in Japan == Noémi Raymond's textile design shows the influence of Japanese block- print textiles of the 1930s. She and her husband observed in 1935: \\"The doing away with all but essentials, or discipline, is the basis of Japanese charm... All is the direct result of a necessity, be it material or spiritual.\\" Furniture design earned Noémi Raymond praise from her contemporaries. Tasked with blending East and West in a minka-inspired living room by golf course designer Akaboshi Shiro, the artist created \\"tubular metal chairs\\" upholstered to mimic \\"traditional Japanese weaving.\\" Noémi Raymond's insight applied to artistic trends as much as it did to daily life, evident by her inclusion of strategically placed mirrors in the Akaboshi home which allowed his wife to monitor the children from her bedroom. ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1980 deaths Category:French women artists Category:People from Cannes Category:American designers Category:American women artists Category:French designers ","title":"Noémi Raymond"},{"id":"56773302","text":"Lynda Pope (born 19 April 1953), née Maddern, is an Australian chess player who hold the title of Woman International Master (WIM, 1972).

He has worked on many state and national campaigns, either independently or as part of a consulting firm which he co-founded in 1997. ==Early life and education== Named after former New York governor and U.S. ambassador Averell Harriman, Smith was introduced to politics at a young age, working on his father Arlo Smith’s campaign for District Attorney of San Francisco. He campaigned for George McGovern for president in 1972 at age 13. His first job was at a legal processor on Taylor and Market Streets in San Francisco, before working as a consultant for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the 1980s. ==Career== Beginning in 1988, Smith began to focus his political work on opposition research, including work for Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles. He used the same methods to identify potential vulnerabilities of his own clients, for example in Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign. He unearthed a minor billing scandal in the Department of Water and Power involving incumbent Mayor James Hahn that helped his client Antonio Villaraigosa win the election. and provided members of the press with the roster of the Canadian football team the Hamilton Tiger-Cats after it was reported that Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo had falsely claimed to play for them, when Delgadillo was running against Smith's client Jerry Brown in the 2006 Democratic primary. Campaigns he has worked on include those of Doug Wilder (1989), Senator Patty Murray (1992), Senator Dianne Feinstein (1992), Senator Kent Conrad (1993), Congressman Richard Gephardt (1994-2002), California Governor Gray Davis (1998, 2002), Senator Barbara Boxer (1992-2010) and Howard Dean for President (2004). In 2008, Smith led Senator Hillary Clinton's 9-point victory in California's Democratic primary by identifying key demographic groups like Latino voters and working women and concentrating his efforts on mail-in and other early voters. He oversaw the campaign in Texas, achieving a second surprising victory. Smith directed Antonio Villaraigosa’s winning underdog Los Angeles Mayoral campaign in 2005 and Jerry Brown’s winning campaign for CA Attorney General 2006. He was State Director for Senator Hillary Clinton’s campaigns in CA, TX and NC in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. In 2010 he was instrumental in San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris’s winning bid for California Attorney General and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom’s successful campaign for California Lt. Governor. He ran Ed Lee’s mayoral reelection campaign. After successfully contributing to the passing of Governor Jerry Brown's landmark tax legislation Proposition 30 in 2012, Smith was hired by Lenore Anderson, executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice and chair of the Proposition 47 campaign, and that measure succeeded at the polls as well. ==Activism== Smith and his wife Laura Talmus started Beyond Differences, a non-profit based in San Rafael, California to honor their daughter Lili Smith, who died in 2009 from complications due to Apert syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that causes facial and cranial disfiguration and which consequently caused her to suffer from feelings of social isolation. The organization endeavors to combat social isolation in young teens.

The ferries are owned by the Government of New South Wales and operated by Transdev Sydney Ferries under the government's Sydney Ferries brand. ==History== The need for new ferries on the Manly-Circular Quay service was identified during the mid-1970s, during which time the service was characterised by deteriorating quality and low patronage. ===Decline of the Manly ferries=== Prior to 1971, the ferry services on the Manly-Circular Quay route were operated by the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company. In that year, the company posted a modest profit of $112,000. Patronage was approaching all-time lows, but the growth prospect for ferry services was considered strong. In November 1971, the company attracted a $1.5 million takeover bid from diversified transport company Brambles Industries. The initial bid was rejected, but a later offer of $2.1 million was accepted. When Brambles took over, the Manly fleet consisted of four ferries: South Steyne, North Head, Bellubera and Baragoola, plus hydrofoils Manly, Fairlight and Dee Why. Almost immediately, the hydrofoils were sold to Waltons Finance and leased back. The four ferries were all ageing and expensive to maintain, and it soon became evident that Brambles intended to close the service or sell the ships to the State Government at the earliest opportunity. Fare increases and service suspensions followed. The Bellubera was withdrawn from service on 14 December 1973; the Baragoola was to follow early the next year. Public outrage and fears that the service would be suspended entirely led to the government resuming responsibility for the operation of the ferries in February 1974. Concerns about the on-going serviceability of the existing vessels led to a decision to modify the design of the Lady Wakehurst and Lady Northcott, then under construction for use on the inner harbour routes, so that they could be used as relief boats on the Manly run. On 27 August 1974 the public timetable was reduced to only require two ships. The decision to modify the two Lady Class vessels proved fortuitous; as both the North Head and the Baragoola had to be sent for major overhauls, and the smaller ferries acted as relief ships while these works were carried out. During the naming ceremony for the Lady Northcott on 11 February 1975, then Liberal Minister for Transport Wal Fife announced that two new ferries would be introduced to the Manly service within three years. ===The Burness Corlett report=== A First Fleet class ferry passes a Freshwater class ferry. The Freshwater class are the largest ferries in the Sydney Ferries fleet. A study by maritime consultants Burness Corlett Australia was released in July 1976. It investigated the requirements of new vessels to replace the North Head and Baragoola by 1978. Various configurations were considered, including conventional monohull, catamaran, hovercraft and hydrofoil. Planing ferries of both single and twin-hull configuration were rejected, as such a configuration cannot be double-ended and therefore would have required berthing stern-first. Hydrofoils were also rejected from consideration due to excessive cost and limited passenger capacity. Two options were selected for detailed investigation: monohull and twin-hull, both double-ended and having 1,200 passengers capacity. Detailed designs and blueprints were prepared for both options. The study recommended the selection of the twin-hull due to the higher service frequency achievable (due to the twin-hull's faster speed of 18 knots versus 14.5 knots), however the study noted that other than this, there was relatively little difference between the options. The twin-hull was designed with dimensions of length, beam, and draft, while the monohull design was length, beam, and draft. The wider beam of the twin-hull design would exceed the limits of the existing wharves at Circular Quay, and necessitate a reconfiguration of the wharves if selected. Burness Corlett were confident that the twin-hull option was the superior choice, due to service speed and stability through Sydney Heads, and so no model tests were performed for the monohull design. Burness Corlett predicted that either design would take approximately 21 months to construct, and that if the new ferries were to be introduced in 1978 as planned, an aggressive construction program would have to begin immediately, with tenders to be called no later than April 1976 (the report was not even released until three months after this date). ===New ferries announced=== After a change of government at the 1976 election, the new Labor government's Transport Minister Peter Cox announced that tenders would be called for the construction of a new \\"super ferry\\" in line with the results of the engineering study, to carry up to 1,200 passengers at speeds of . On 9 January 1978, the traditional three- ship Manly Ferry timetable was reintroduced. The service was operated with the Baragoola (1922), North Head (1913) and either the Lady Wakehurst or Lady Northcott. However, the modified Lady class ships were not good substitutes for the two older vessels, as the newer Lady ferries were too small and too slow for the Manly service. Particularly the Lady class ships were barely able to keep to the published timetable in peak hours. Following the return of the Labor Government at the State Election on 7 Oct 1978, the Labor Party's Alan Stewart became the Member for Manly. This provided a fresh political impetus for the State Labor administration to order the new Manly ferries. Steelwork for Freshwater was laid down at the State Dockyard on 31 October 1980. Strike actions delayed completion until June 1982. The ferry terminals at Circular Quay and Manly were substantially modified to accommodate the larger ferries, including the installation of wide height-adjustable two-level hydraulic ramps. Additionally a new bus-interchange was built in the wharf forecourt at Manly. ===Possible Retirement 2021-2023 === There are plans to replace the Freshwater class ferries with 3 new Emerald class catamaran ferries between 2021 and 2023. No decision has been made as yet on the future of the Freshwater Ferries.What will be changing in 2020? Transdev Sydney Ferries ==VesselsFreshwater===  MV Freshwater is the lead ship of the four Freshwater class ferries. It is named after Freshwater Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches. It was launched on 27 March 1982 by Olivia Cox and commissioned by her husband, Minister for Transport Peter Cox, on 18 December 1982. The three-month old ferry ran aground at Manly Cove in March 1983 after overshooting the wharf following a computer failure. On 30 March 1985, Freshwater was hijacked by a man who threatened to shoot passengers unless the captain piloted the ferry beyond Sydney Heads into the ocean. The hijacker was subdued after a police officer boarded the vessel and fired three warning shots. It turned out that the man, a New Zealander, had not been carrying a gun, but an empty vodka bottle (the second of two that he had consumed before boarding the vessel) concealed under his jacket. After a short jail sentence, the man returned to New Zealand in January 1986 by stowing away on the Oriana, for which he was also fined. ===Queenscliff===  MV Queenscliff is the second of the four Freshwater class ferries to enter service. It is named after Queenscliff Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches. ===Narrabeen===  MV Narrabeen is the third of the four Freshwater class ferries to enter service. It is named after Narrabeen Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She is the third Manly ferry to be called \\"Narrabeen\\". Narrabeen (I) was an 1886-built iron paddle-steamer that was hulked in 1917. Narrabeen (II) was built in 1921 and was the last of the Manly cargo ferries. She was sold out of the Manly run in 1928 and wrecked in 1958. ===Collaroy===  MV Collaroy is the final Freshwater class ferry to enter service. It is named after Collaroy Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches. Collaroy differed from its classmates in having been equipped with underwater stabilisers and enhanced radar for use on ocean cruises.MV Collaroy II ferriesofsydney.com The stabilisers were removed during the vessel's last major overhaul and the control systems upgraded to match that being fitted during overhauls of the other Freshwater class. Collaroy can no longer do ocean cruising. When Sydney hosted the 2000 Summer Olympics, Collaroy was the vessel used to carry the Olympic torch across Sydney Harbour. In February 2001, Collaroy ran aground on Manly Point, putting the ferry out of service for several months and costing $2 million to repair. ==See also== * List of Sydney Harbour ferries ==References Category:Ferry transport in Sydney Category:1980s ships ","title":"Freshwater-class ferry"},{"id":"56773619","text":"Francis Zimwara (born 22 June 1986) is a retired Zimbabwean sprinter who specialized in the 100 and 200 metres.

The conservation park consists of land in the following cadastral unit - section 227 of the Hundred of Kennion, section 228 of the Hundred of Fox and sections 154 and 186 of the Hundred of Smith and which occupies the watercourse of Reedy Creek from Clay Wells Road (also known as the Robe - Reedy Creek road) in the south for a distance of about . It was proclaimed on 8 March 1973 as a conservation park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 in respect to sections 154, 227 and 228. On 24 April 1986, Section 186 of the Hundred of Smith was added to the conservation park by proclamation. Both proclamations included the requirement for the South Eastern Drainage Board to have “having full, free and unrestricted right and liberty” to enter the conservation park to carry out duties and functions described in the South Eastern Drainage Act 1931. It was proclaimed because of “its fine stand of river red gums,” however the land continued to be grazed until 1978 due to the existence of a lease over the land. As of 2016, it covered an area of . In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now- defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant for the following reasons: > The Park represents the only large stand of River Red Gum in the vicinity. > Being a long narrow Park it forms an important corridor of habitat for > nomadic and migratory birds such as honeyeaters, notably the uncommon > blackchinned honeyeater and parrots. The Park also contains small areas of > swampy habitat. In February 1983, the southern half of the conservation park was burnt during the Ash Wednesday bushfires. In 1990, the conservation park was described as \\"an interdunal plain of calcarenite with sandy, mottled yellow duplex soils\\" covered with vegetation consisting of \\"a river red gun open forest/woodland community\\" which gradually changes into a brown stringybark woodland at its western boundary. The conservation park is the only part of the Reedy Creek watercourse which \\"ensures regeneration of the river red gums\\" because the rest of the watercourse is used for grazing. As of 1990, visitation consisted of use “mainly by local residents”. It was also considered to have “potential” for use as an educational resource by the Kangaroo Inn Area School which is located about west of the conservation park's southern boundary in the locality of Kangaroo Inn. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category IV protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== * ==External links== *Reedy Creek Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast Category:South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ","title":"Reedy Creek Conservation Park"},{"id":"56774210","text":"The 32nd Filmfare Awards South ceremony honoring the winners of the best of South Indian cinema in 1984 was an event held in 1985. ==AwardsKannada cinema=== {  width=100%  - ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Film ! ! eedd82; text- align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Director -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Accident - Shankar Nag , Sanket  valign=\\"top\\"  *Kashinath - Anubhava - ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Actor ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Actress -  valign=\\"top\\"  * Dr. Rajkumar - Shravana Banthu  valign=\\"top\\"  *Abhinaya - Anubhava - } ===Malayalam cinema=== {  width=100%  - ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Film ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Director -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Aalkkoottathil Thaniye - Raju Mathew  valign=\\"top\\"  *Bharathan - Ithiri Poove Chuvannapoove - ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Actor ! ! eedd82; text- align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Actress -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Mammootty - Adiyozhukkukal  valign=\\"top\\"  *Nadhiya - Nokkethadhoorathu Kannum Nattu - } ===Tamil cinema=== {  width=100%  - ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Film ! ! eedd82; text-align:center; width:50%;\\"Best Director -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Achamillai Achamillai - Rajam Balachandar, V.

After the war, he continued studies in ethnography, geography and paleontology. In 1921, he became a Doctor of Philosophy. In 1922, Schilder emigrated to Germany. In Berlin he started attending the Entomological Museum. Around this time Schilder married Maria Heitrich, a German chemist. In 1925, Schilder already was a recognized scientist at Naumburg/Saale in the state institute for research on Phylloxera, remaining there until 1947. In 1945, Schilder became a professor of zoology at the University of Halle-sur-Saale where he taught zoogeography and statistics. At first, he combined teaching at Halle with his primary work at Naumburg, however in 1947 he relocated to Halle and started teaching also genetics and anthropology. Between 1954 and 1963 Schilder also lectured one day a week in Leipzig. Schilder retired in 1962, but even after that he was invited to lecture frequently until 1966. Schilder was a member of both English societies, of the German Zoological Society, the German Malacozoological Society, and an honorary member of the Hawaiian Malacological Society and the Keppel Bay Shell Club. Franz Albert Schilder died on 11 August 1970 in Halle. == Research == Since the time when Schilder read an ethnological work Muschelgeldstudien by O. Schneider, he became interested in studying the Cypraeacea and wrote his dissertation about it. Cypraeidae was Schilder’s main research interest throughout his life. Along with his wife, Maria Schilder they were a prolific team of mollusc systematists. Schilder’s complete bibliography comprises over 400 titles, including malacological, entomological, biometrical, etc. as well as text books. Among others he published Lehrbuch der Allegomeinen Zoogeographie, a text which focuses on the recognition of biogeographic areas at all geographic scales. A summary and conclusion of his work “A Catalogue of living and fossil Cowries” was written jointly with his wife, Maria Schilder and published after his death in 1971. Schilder established 45 new genera and 483 new species and subspecies. In his honor were named: the genus Schilderia Tomlin 1930; the recent species Lyncina schilderorum Iredale 1939, the fossil species Zoila schilderi Dey (1932) 1941, and the race Cypraea tigris schilderiana Cate 1961. ==References== Category:1896 births Category:1970 deaths Category:German zoologists Category:German taxonomists Category:Conchologists Category:German malacologists Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Franz Alfred Schilder"},{"id":"56774299","text":"Kerstin Kartscher (*1966) is a German artist who lives and works in London. Her central medium is drawing. Often her works evolve out of combining finely detailed drawings with found objects, or man made materials, that can be merged in installations. Kartscher creates drawings and installations of imaginary worlds populated by nameless heroines who celebrate their femininity, liberated from social, emotional and psychological constraints, within fantastical, elegant and immense landscapes. == Biography == Kerstin Kartscher studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg from 1987 to 1987 and the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg from 1989 to 1994, where she received a master's degree in Fine Arts in 1996. She was the third artist to participate in the Tate St Ives Artist Residency Programme based at Porthmeor Studios. During the residency, Kartscher evolved a new body of work, and created a central installation, Private War, and other fantastic landscapes in inks, marker pens, acrylic and collage that was exhibited at Tate St Ives in October 2005.

Following a chronological path linked to the most important musical subjects in Prato - institutions, composers and interpreters - and studying the handwritten and printed music brought to us, we were able to delineate a historical and cultural itinerary of the pratese musical life. ==History== The most antique musical collections of the city of Prato are the “pergamenacei” (made of parchment) liturgical book of the fourteenth century of Chapter origin, which are now preserved at the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. (it) The fourteenth- century cappella left little trace and merged with the new one, established in 1535. Beginning in 1981, a great deal of musical material of the latter institution belongs to the Archivio Storico Diocesano (Historical Diocesan Archive), in which there are many sources regarding its activities, as in the Archivio del Capitolo della Cattedrale (Archive of the Chapter in the Cathedral). The cappella saw rotations of Kappellmeister such as Giovanni Francesco Beccatelli (1679-1734), Giuseppe Becherini (1758-1840), Augusto Borgioli (1821-1879), Luigi Borgioli (1864-1939) whose works are conserved in the Historical Archive of the Cappella of the Duomo, together with the works of the most performed artists of the different time periods (Giovan Carlo Maria Clari, Nicola Benvenuti, Giuseppe Gherardeschi). (it) In 1981, The Historical Diocesan Archive also gathered the materials of 61 parishes together, which is preserved today in the Archives of the parishes. There are many chorals and sacred music, manuscripts and printed, that cover a vast period of time, from the fourteenth century to the twentieth century. (it) The activities of the chapel were sided with the production of secular music, which left traces mostly beginning in the eighteenth century. The Cicognini Boarding School has manuscripts of the performances staged by the boarders from 1780 until 1870, including comic operas and dance music from Mozart to Zandonai. (it) Starting in 1842, the group «Concerto Cittadino Edoardo Chiti», of which the archive conserves a large amount of music of various genres used in their frequent concerts (it); and at the end of the eighteenth century, the choir «Guido Monaco» was formed, which has a musical archive consisting of a large amount of printed edition vocal music. (it) left289x289px These institutions represented the musical vocation of the citizens for over a century, offering an example of one of the most important civil musical activities in Tuscany, to which many talented composers contributed. In the 19th century Cesare Ciardi, Attilio Ciardi, Attilio Nuti were active in Prato, and whose autographs are spread throughout the institutions in Prato. The personal archive of Attilio Ciardi is preserved in the Music School «Giuseppe Verdi» (it), which today inherits the civil musical vocation that had inspired the Chiti Band and the «Guido Monaco» Choir. The 1900s saw the revival of the sacred production with the organist of the Cathedral, Guido Guasti, whose documents (especially those regarding the years between 1939 and 1947) are in the Historic Diocesan Archive (it), with the reopening of the Cappella in 1951, whose materials (printed sacred music in modern editions) are today in the Church of San Francesco (it), but above all with the activities of the secular composers who most influenced the musical possessions of Prato the 20th century. Dante Nuti (it), Giovanni Castagnoli (it), and especially Luciano Bettarini, one of the most important musicians of the 20th century, worked in Prato. (it) What they left behind is preserved in the Historic Diocesan Archive and in great part, in their personal collections at the Music School «Giuseppe Verdi», which possesses also the enormous collections, of recordings and music, of some Pratese collectionists. (it) (it) In 1969, the «Guido Monaco» Choir founded their children’s choir, and promoted of a competition for the citizens in which music by Nino Rota was also performed. Today this is preserved in the archive of the choir. Books dedicated to musical subjects (some of which come from the antique cappella of the 16th century) are in Roncioniana Library (it), in the Teatro Metastasio (it), and in the Salvi Cristiani Collection at the State Archive.

The company was rebranded Trip.com in November, 2016 and acquired by the Ctrip Group in 2017. Founded in 2010, by Travis Katz and Ori Zaltzman, by 2014 the company was the fifth most visited travel-planning site in the United States. The platform employed artificial intelligence to allow users to research and book destinations and places to go, including hotels, restaurants, bars and attractions in more than 60,000 destinations, and its community of users could share reviews and pictures from their own travel experiences. Forbes referred to the company as a \\"social network for travelers.\\" In 2019, following the acquisition by CTrip, CTrip subsidiary Skyscanner merged the company's content and technology into its platform, branding it the \\"Explore\\" section of the Skyscanner application. == Description == Gogobot was a travel-planning and local discovery service that is available both on the web, and via iOS and Android applications. It allowed users to research and book hotels, restaurants, and activities at destinations around the world, reading reviews from its community of travelers and browsing photos. The company was an early pioneer in applying artificial intelligence to travel, leveraging data from a user's location, preselected interests, local weather, past behavior and more to predict places a user may be interested in visiting. In addition to social data, Gogobot allowed users to self identify with more than 19 \\"Tribes\\" (e.g. Foodies, Family Travelers, Nightlife lovers) allowing users to \\"cut through the noise\\" to see reviews and opinions from people with similar tastes and interests. As part of the planning aspect of the application, users could plan out itineraries, organizing them day by day and syncing them to multiple devices. In September 2014, the platform debuted a feature called \\"Gogo This Week\\" which showcases handpicked events happening that week in large destination cities including Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, and London. The application was available online as well as on iOS and Android devices. == Company history == Gogobot was founded in 2010 by Travis Katz and Ori Zaltzman. Travis Katz had previously served as the senior vice president and GM, International for social media site MySpace, and Ori Zaltzman was the lead architect for Yahoo! Search BOSS and lead technologist at Yahoo! Answers. Katz came up with the idea for an online planning tool while working at MySpace, citing personal frustration with how long it took to make travel plans online, while noting that the larger online trip planning sites lacked \\"personal relevance.\\" The company secured $4 million in its first round of venture funding from Battery Ventures in July 2010. The website launched in November 2010. The same year that the website was launched, it was awarded a Crunchie award for best design by TechCrunch, beating AirBnB and About.me. The iOS application was released in October 2011. In 2011, the platform announced several integrations with companies including Flipboard, Facebook, and Foursquare that would allow users to connect to their friends and other users through aspects of other social media platforms. In 2011, the platform was included in a list of 50 Best Websites by Time magazine. In October, 2011, the company raised an additional $15 million in venture capital in a series B round of funding led by Redpoint Ventures. By 2012, the company's base of active users had grown to over two million members. After identifying that almost 44 percent of the site's users were coming from Europe, the company established a European headquarters in London in April 2012. The Android application was released in January 2013. Later that year, the company announced a partnership with HomeAway, a vacation rental company. The partnership led to the launch of \\"Insider Guides,\\" on the HomeAway website and mobile apps allowing HomeAway's property managers and hosts to create personalized guides for their guests, highlighting the best things to see or do near their property. The content and reviews these hosts created would live on both Gogobot and HomeAway sites (including HomeAway and VRBO). The company became the fastest growing travel website in 2013 achieving 3.7 million users. In 2014, the site had more than 720,000 original reviews of hotels, attractions and restaurants, and 4 million photos. The company launched a redesigned mobile app in 2014 in response to users increasingly using the service for local discovery, rather than simply travel planning. The new site design also included a revamped company logo and a new \\"Tribes\\" feature that helps users filter places based on what is popular among people with similar interests such as foodies or adventure-seekers. In November 2014, the company secured $20 million in venture capital financing, led by HomeAway with participation from Redpoint Ventures and Battery Ventures. In 2016, the company acquired the Trip.com brand from Expedia and the business was rebranded from Gogobot to Trip.com. The same year, the company launched a partnership with Hostelworld to give Hostelworld's customers access, in-app, to Gogobot's City Guides. In 2017, the company was acquired by Ctrip Group. At the time of the acquisition, CTrip indicated the company had 60 million users. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed. Trip.com, became the flagship brand for CTrip, which renamed the holding company the Trip.com Group.

He was the youngest member of the British Astronomical Association, and constructed his own reflecting telescope. He spent weeks in a junkyard to find parts with which he remade an old green Bentley and a Scott Super Squirrel motorcycle, which he then rode. Hayward's mother did not allow him go to university, as a result, Hayward left school at 16 to become an apprentice at Dollis Hill, where he collaborated with Dr Eric Speight on making the TIM speaking clock service. During the Second World War, Hayward worked at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill with Tommy Flowers, developing the Tunny and Colossus, decryption machines which were crucial to the development of later computers. By the culmination of the war, as many as 15 Tunny machines were used at Bletchley Park, supplying Allied leaders close to 300 messages from the German High Command per week. Amongst other things, Tunny gave important intelligence for D-Day.\\" Over 13,000 messages were read in total. During World War II, Hayward served in Egypt with the Intelligence Corps, where he developed bugging equipment to listen to conversations between captured German prisoners of war. Expecting to be dropped into Turkey to sabotage telecoms systems, Hayward was instead called back to London to, and was assigned to put effort on code breaking. At Bletchley Park, Hayward was at the helm of a team of around 12 post office engineers worked to check machines and keep them functioning. At the twilight of the war, he helped dismantle the code breaking machines and reinstall two Colossus machines at Eastcote, North London. After the war, Hayward worked on a secret voice encipherment system before moving to Ghana to install telecoms networks. In the 1950s, during the Malayan Emergency, Hayward joined the special of the Royal Malaysian Police and was tasked with designing “special techniques devices” for use against the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the militant arm of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). By the 1980s, Hayward had patented the first electronic security seal, setting up the company Encrypta Electronics with his son Mark to manufacture the product. The devices are still used widely in the fields of distribution and transport. In the 1990s he helped researchers at The National Museum of Computing (TNMOC) rebuild the Tunny and Colossus machines by crafting new parts from blueprints he had kept against the orders of Winston Churchill who was concerned that they could fall into Soviet hands. He was honoured with a special medal for his services to codebreaking in 1996. Hayward's son Mark told BBC Radio 4 that it was 'somewhat disappointing that because he worked in secret work, like all these chaps did, that they were never truly honoured by the country for the contribution they made'. ==References== Category:British cryptographers Category:1917 births Category:2011 deaths ","title":"Gil Hayward"},{"id":"56774686","text":"Walk Like a Panther is a 2018 British comedy film directed by Dan Cadan and starring Stephen Graham, Jason Flemyng, Julian Sands, Jill Halfpenny, Robbie Gee, Stephen Tompkinson and Sue Johnston.

An international between the United States and Canada at Baltimore Memorial Stadium in 1995, which acted as a curtain raiser for a CFL match between the Baltimore Stallions and Toronto Argonauts, posted a crowd of 27,853. \\\\---- { border=\\"0\\" width=\\"100%\\" class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" -

The war was very expensive. It was paid for by high taxes, by selling off assets, and by accepting large amounts of Lend Lease from the U.S. and Canada. The US gave $30 billion in munitions; Canada also gave aid. (The American and Canadian aid did not have to be repaid, but there were also American loans that were repaid.) Britain's total mobilisation during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a \\"people's war\\" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of better Britain after the war.Mark Donnelly, Britain in the Second World War (1999) is a short survey The media called it a \\"people's war\\"—a term that caught on and signified the popular demand for planning and an expanded welfare state.Angus Calder, The people's war: Britain, 1939–1945 (1969) Indeed by 1945 the Post- war consensus emerged that did deliver a welfare state.Brian Harrison, \\"The rise, fall and rise of political consensus in Britain since 1940.\\" History 84.274 (1999): 301-324. online The Royal family played major symbolic roles in the war. They refused to leave London during the Blitz and were indefatigable in visiting troops, munition factories, dockyards, and hospitals all over the country. All social classes appreciated how the royals shared the hopes, fears and hardships of the people.Alfred F. Havighurst, Britain in Transition: The Twentieth Century (1962) ch 9 The British relied successfully on voluntarism. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the area under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 acres (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labour force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.Calder, The People's War: Britain, 1939–45 (1969) pp. 276–83, 411–30 See also Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II, Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II and Diplomatic history of World War II. ==PoliticsPlanning the welfare state=== The common experience of suffering wartime hardships placed on the political agenda a new consensus regarding the need for a post-war welfare state: universal social security, a free national health service, improved secondary education, expanded housing, and family allowances.Richard Titmuss, Essays on 'the welfare state (1958), pp. 75-87.Paul Addison, The Road to 1945, pp 13-14, 239.John Bew, Clement Attlee (2017), pp 267-68. 294-95. The success of the wartime government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as the prevailing egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. It was supported by the coalition government and all major parties. Welfare conditions, especially regarding food, improved during the war as the government imposed rationing and subsidized food prices. Conditions for housing worsened of course with the bombing, and clothing was in short supply. Equality increased dramatically, as incomes declined sharply for the wealthy and for white collar workers, as their taxes soared, while blue collar workers benefited from rationing and price controls.Sidney Pollard, The development of the British economy 1914–1950 (1962 and later editions) pp 339–48 People demanded an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices. The Labour Party took the initiative but the Conservatives took the lead in the Education Act of 1944.F. M. Leventhal, Twentieth-Century Britain: an Encyclopedia (1995) pp 74–75, 251-52, 830 It made major improvements in the provision and governance of secondary schools in England and Wales. Historians consider it a \\"triumph for progressive reform,\\" and it became a core element of the Post-war consensus supported by all major parties.Kevin Jefferys, \\"R. A. Butler, the Board of Education and the 1944 Education Act,\\" History (1984) 69#227 pp 415–431. The goal of a welfare state was operationalized in a famous report by William Beveridge, of the Liberal Party. Beveridge declared war on the five 'giant evils' of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. He recommended that the various income maintenance services that had grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.Brian Abel‐Smith, \\"The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes.\\" International Social Security Review (1992) 45#1‐2 pp 5–16. Planning for postwar housing began in 1941, with Conservatives arguing that more property-owning would give people a real economic stake in society; promises to expand ownership became the signature Conservative issue after 1945, while Labour still deprecated private ownership.Harriet Jones, \\"‘This is magnificent!’: 300,000 houses a year and the Tory revival after 1945.\\" Contemporary British History 14#1 (2000): 99-121. All parties wanted to stimulate the construction industry. The consensus policy was that local authorities would lead in the transitional period but that, in the longer run, the majority of new building would be left to the private sector. Local government would then revert to the prewar role, concentrating on slum clearance and provision for the least well-off. Financial stringencies in the late 1940s postponed the ideal plan into the 1950s. –Peter Malpass, \\"Wartime planning for post-war housing in Britain: the Whitehall debate, 1941-5.\\" Planning Perspectives 18#2 (2003): 177-196.Peter Malpass, \\"Fifty years of British housing policy: Leaving or leading the welfare state?.\\" International Journal of Housing Policy 4#2 (2004): 209-227. ==Economics== Britain had a highly successful record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people. By 1941 GDP was 21 per cent greater than in 1938, In Britain was the most fully mobilized nation, economically, in the entire war and remains so throughout. Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success.Robin Havers, The Second World War: Europe, 1939-1943 (2002) Volume 4, p 75W.K. Hancock and M. Gowing, British War Economy (1949) online ===Finance=== In 6 years of war, there was a net inflow of £10 billion. Of this £1.1 billion came from the sale of investments; £3.5 billion was made up of new borrowing, of which £2.7 billion was contributed by the Empire's Sterling Area. Canada made C$3 billion in gifts and loans on easy terms. Above all came the American money, and loans and Lend Lease grants of £5.4 billion. This funded heavy purchases of munitions, food, oil, machinery and raw materials. There was no charge for Lend Lease supplies delivered during the war. There was a charge for supplies delivered after September 2, 1945. Britain's borrowing from India and other countries measured by \\"sterling balances\\" amounted to £3.4 billion in 1945. Britain treated this as a long- term loan with no interest and no specified repayment date. The British treasury was nearly empty by 1945.Marcelo de Paiva Abreu, \\"India as a creditor: sterling balances, 1940-1953.\\" (Department of Economics, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, 2015) online When the war began Britain imposed exchange controls. The British Government used its gold reserves and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in March 1941 began Lend-Lease, whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which did not have to be repaid.Walter Yust, ed. Ten Eventful years (1947) 2:859 ===Industry=== As an island nation, when war broke out in 1939, Great Britain was dependent for so many of its supplies on imports by sea. The days of significant air cargo traffic had yet to arrive but would have been equally vulnerable to enemy attack. Although the term was not used in those days, there was an immediate recourse to recycling to conserve scarce resources. Garden railings were removed for their scrap metal and aluminium kitchen saucepans were collected for their potential in the aircraft industry. Whilst there may have been undue optimism of some of the benefits, nevertheless, the whole population was involved in a practical way in helping the war effort.https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/58/a8636358.shtml David Edgerton has emphasized the success story in producing munitions at home and using the Empire and the U.S. to build a very large high quality stock of weapons.David Edgerton, Warfare State: Britain, 1920–1970 (Cambridge UP, 2005). Industrial production was reoriented toward munitions, and output soared. In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the War Department, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need.Peter Howlett, \\"Resource allocation in wartime Britain: The case of steel, 1939-45,\\" Journal of Contemporary History, (July 1994) 29#3 pp 523-44 Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940—more than enough to cover the losses—and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.Postan (1952), Chapter 4. Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billionHancock, British War Economy online p 353 'Harvesting' by Adrian Allinson promoted English agriculture and the \\"Dig for Victory\\" campaign. ===Rural economies=== Before the war Britain imported 70% of its food. Home agricultural production increased 35% during the war. In terms of calories, domestic output nearly doubled. Together with imports and rationing, this meant the British were well fed—they ate less meat (down 36% by 1943) and more wheat (up 81%) and potatoes (up 96%).Hancock (1949) p 550. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labour force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.Calder, The People's War (1969) pp 411–30 Farm women had expanded duties, with the young men absent at war. They were helped by prisoners of war from Italy and Germany. The Women's Land Army brought in tens of thousands of young women from urban areas for paid labour on farms that needed them, at about 30 shillings a week. Wages for available male farmworkers tripled during the war to £3 a week. The British \\"Dig on for Victory\\" poster promoted victory gardens One new specialty was harvesting timber, for which the government set up the Women's Timber Corps, a branch of the Women's Land Army that operated 1942-46.Emma Vickers, \\"'The Forgotten Army of the Woods': The Women's Timber Corps during the Second World War\\" Agricultural History Review (2011) 59#1 101-112. For townspeople and even city folk, the government promoted Victory Gardens that grew vegetables, fruits, and herbs. About 1.4 million allotments were made; they took some of the pressure off the food rationing system and boosted civilian morale.Gowdy-Wygant, Cultivating Victory pp 131-64. Franklin Ginn peels away complex layers of meaning beyond growing some food. Participants were not randomly digging; they were promoting self-sufficiency, imposing control over the domestic sphere, and exhibiting patriotism in working for the common good of winning the war. There were sharply different gender roles and class experiences—gardening had been a favourite elite hobby and the upper class women helping out knew what they were doing. The much touted statistics of additional food production were designed to foster general confidence in the progress of the war, not just the progress of plants.Franklin Ginn, \\"Dig for victory! New histories of wartime gardening in Britain.\\" Journal of Historical Geography 38#3 (2012): 294-305. ===Rationing=== Civilian rationing: A shopkeeper cancels the coupons in a housewife's ration book in 1943. Her coupons were only good at one shop. Rationing was designed to provide minimum standards of essential consumption for all members of society, to reduce waste, reduce trans-Atlantic shipping usage, and make possible the production of more war supplies with less variety. The theme of equality of sacrifice was paramount. Just before the war began Britain was importing 20,000,000 long tons of food per year, including about 70% of its cheese and sugar, nearly 80% of fruits and about 70% of cereals and fats. The UK also imported more than half of its meat, and relied on imported feed to support its domestic meat production. The civilian population of the country was about 50 million. It was one of the principal strategies of the Germans in the Battle of the Atlantic to attack shipping bound for Britain, restricting British industry and potentially starving the nation into submission. To deal with sometimes extreme shortages, the Ministry of Food instituted a system of rationing. To buy most rationed items, each person had to register at chosen shops, and was provided with a ration book containing coupons that were only good at that shop. The shopkeeper was provided with enough food for registered customers. Purchasers had to take ration books with them when shopping, so that the relevant coupon or coupons could be cancelled.Calder, People's War pp 380-86. ==Scotland, Wales and Northern IrelandScotland=== King George VI visiting the Home Fleet based at Scapa Flow, Scotland, March 1943 The outbreak of the world war in 1939 temporarily arrested the ongoing decline in heavy industry, with the city's shipyards and heavy industries working. To slow arms production down, the Luftwaffe bombed the Clydeside. The worst was the Clydebank Blitz in March 1941 that left tens of thousands of Glaswegians homeless and destruction of housing caused by the war would leave a lasting legacy for the city decades later.Ian Johnston, Ships for a Nation: John Brown & Company, Clydebank (2000). ===Wales=== Wales had been hard hit by deindustrialisation and high unemployment in the 1920s and 1930s. The war turned the economy around.D.W. Howell and C. Baber. \\"Wales.\\" in F.M.L. Thompson, ed., The Cambridge social history of Britain 1750 – 1950 (1990), 1:310. Because much of Wales was too distant for German bombers and it had a large pool of unemployed men immediately available for work, it suddenly became an attractive relocation destination for war industries and ordinance factories. The historic basic industries of coal and steel saw a very heavy new demand. The best coal seams had long been depleted. It was more and more expensive to get to the remaining coal, but coal was urgently needed, and shipping it in from North America would overburden the limited supply system.D. A. Thomas, \\"War and the Economy: The South Wales Experience\\" in C. Baber and L.J. Williams, eds., Modern South Wales: Essays in Economic History (U of Wales Press, 1986) pp 251-77. ===Belfast=== Belfast is a representative British city that has been well studied by historians.Brian Barton, \\"The Belfast Blitz: April–May 1941,\\" History Ireland, (1997) 5#3 pp 52–57Robson S. Davison, \\"The Belfast Blitz,\\" Irish Sword: Journal of the Military History Society of Ireland, (1985) 16#63 pp 65–83 It was a key industrial city producing ships, tanks, aircraft, engineering works, arms, uniforms, parachutes and a host of other industrial goods. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.Boyd Black, \\"A Triumph of Voluntarism? Industrial Relations and Strikes in Northern Ireland in World War Two,\\" Labour History Review (2005) 70#1 pp 5–25 As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city for example. The Northern Ireland government under Richard Dawson Bates (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. When Germany conquered France in Spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city's fire brigade was inadequate; there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them; and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After seeing the Blitz in London in the autumn of 1940, the government began to build air raid shelters. In early 1941, the Luftwaffe flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Especially hard hit were the working class areas in the north and east of the city, where over 1000 were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city in fear of future attacks. The bombing revealed the terrible slum conditions. In May 1941, the Luftwaffe hit the docks and the Harland and Wolff shipyard, closing it for six months. Apart from the numbers of dead, the Belfast Blitz saw half of the city's houses destroyed. About £20 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland's Prime Minister J. M. Andrews resigned. The bombing raids continued until the Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. From January 1942, United States soldiers began to arrive in Northern Ireland, in preparation for the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944. ==Civilian casualties== Figures produced by the Ministry of Home Security give a total of 60,595 civilians killed and 86,182 seriously wounded, directly due to enemy action. {  + style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Bombing Casualties in Britain (1940–1945) - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year !! scope=\\"col\\"  Dead !! scope=\\"col\\"  Seriously injured - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1940  23,767  30,529 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1941  20,885  21,841 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1942  3,236  4,150 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1943  2,372  3,450 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1944  8,475  21,989 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1945  1,860  4,223 } Of these, 51,509 were killed by bombing, 8,398 by V-1 flying bombs or V-2 rockets, and 148 by artillery bombardment. These figures do not include 1,200 killed while on duty with the Home Guard, or 32,000 civilian merchant seamen lost at sea. (Introduction) The total civilian deaths represent 0.1 percent of the United Kingdom population, or about 15 percent of Britain's war dead. ==Society and cultureEvacuations=== Child evacuees from Bristol arriving at in Devon in 1940 Public opinion in the 1930s was horrified at this prospect of massive bombing of major cities. The government planned to evacuate schoolchildren and others to towns and rural areas where they would be safe. Operation Pied Piper began on 1 September 1939, and relocated more than 3.5 million children and teachers - about half from London. The average evacuee traveled about 40 miles, but some traveled longer distances. There was no bombing in 1939, so they soon returned home. After a German invasion was possible and the Blitz began in September 1940, there was a second major wave of evacuation in June 1940 from targeted cities. There were also small-scale evacuations of children to Canada. Many families relocated to safer areas on their own. The host families worked well with most children, however there was a minority from poor, undernourished, unhygienic and uncooperative environments who brought along a strong distrust of authority. The confrontation was an eye-opener to both sides, and played a role in convincing the British middle-class to support expanded welfare programs. For the first time it became clear that middle class and rich people needed help too - they were bombed out of their homes and schools as well. Sociologist Richard Titmuss argues, \\"Reports in 1939 about the condition of evacuated mothers and children aroused the conscience of the nation in the opening phase of the war.\\" He states that the national government: :assumed and developed a measure of direct concern for the health and well-being of the population which, by contrast with the role of Government in the nineteen-thirties, was little short of remarkable. No longer did concern rest on the belief that, in respect to many social needs, it was proper to intervene only to assist the poor and those who were unable to pay for services of one kind and another. Instead, it was increasingly regarded as a proper function or even obligation of Government to war off distress and strain not only among the poor but almost all classes of society.Richard Titmuss, Problems of Social Policy (1950), pages 506 and 507. online free ===Fear=== Air-raid shelter in London in 1940 Historian Amy Bell interprets private diaries, psychologists' notes, and fiction written by Londoners during the war \\"to reveal the hidden landscapes of fear in a city at war.\\" They feared loss of property, loss of their homes and those of family and friends, destruction of their churches and shops, and their own injury and death. Many saw London as a \\"potential canker in the heart of Imperial Britain,\\" with British civilization highly vulnerable to internal weaknesses stemming from an \\"enemy within,\\" specifically, the cowardice among those who remained in London during the war. Worried Londoners often identified as especially susceptible to this weakness the working classes, Jews, and children.Amy Bell, \\"Landscapes of Fear: Wartime London, 1939–1945.\\" Journal of British Studies 48.1 (2009): 153-175. ===Education=== The quality of elementary education in major cities declined because of poor leadership in handling crises, confusion and inconsistency in evacuation and school closings, the destruction of some buildings in air raids, and the military requisition of others. Students were emotionally upset by the bombings; there were endemic shortages of supplies and teachers. The 1944 Education Act had a major impact on improving secondary schools after 1945, but did little for elementary schools. A lesser level of disruption took place in smaller places that were not bombing targets.Eric Hopkins, \\"Elementary education in Birmingham during the Second World War.\\" History of education 18#3 (1989): 243-255.Emma Lautman, \\"Educating Children on the British Home Front, 1939-1945: Oral History, Memory and Personal Narratives.\\" History of education researcher 95 (2015): 13-26.Roy Lowe, \\"Education in England during the Second World War.\\" in Roy Lowe, ed., Education and the Second World War: studies in schooling and social change (1992) pp 4-16. ===Religion=== All the churches gave enthusiastic support for the war, using their facilities to assist the displaced and comfort the fearful. At the local level, popular religiosity remained a vibrant force. Prayer and Sunday services helped many people handle the horrors and the unknowns of warfare. City people reflected on the reality of sudden death as they huddled in air raid shelters.Stephen Parker, Faith on the Home Front: Aspects of Church Life and Popular Religion in Birmingham 1939-1945 (2005). Some sang: :God is our refuge, be not afraid, :He will be with you all through the raid.Angus Calder, The People's War: Britain 1939-1945 (1969) p 480. They told each other how miracles were protecting Britain, pointing to the Miracle of Dunkirk, and how this church and that cathedral miraculously survived the blitz. Not all prayers were answered: over 15,000 church buildings were damaged; the Methodists had 9000 churches, of which 800 were totally destroyed. Many laymen who had volunteered for church work before the war, now turned their attention to civil defence.Calder, The People's War (1969) p 479 The Church of England saw its role as the moral conscience of the state. George Bell, Bishop of Chichester and a few clergymen spoke out that the aerial bombing of German cities was immoral. They were grudgingly tolerated. Bishop Bell was chastised by fellow clergy members and passed over for promotion. The Archbishop of York replied, \\"it is a lesser evil to bomb the war-loving Germans than to sacrifice the lives of our fellow countrymen..., or to delay the delivery of many now held in slavery\\".Andrew Chandler, \\"The Church of England and the obliteration bombing of Germany in the Second World War.\\" English Historical Review 108#429 (1993): 920-946. Diplomat Harold Nicolson was on the BBC Board when it discussed whether clergy should broadcast forgiveness of our enemies. He told the Board, \\"I prefer that to the clergy who seek to pretend that the bombing of Cologne was a Christian act. I wish the clergy would keep their mouths shut about the war. It is none of their business.\\"Calder, The People's War (1969) p 477 Standards of morality in Britain changed dramatically after the world wars, in the direction of more personal freedom, especially in sexual matters. The Church of England and the Catholic Church tried to hold the line and stop the rapid trend toward divorce, while the Dissenters were coming to terms with the new reality of divorced members.G. I. T. Machin, \\"Marriage and the Churches in the 1930s: Royal abdication and divorce reform, 1936–7.\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History 42#1 (1991): 68-81. While the Church of England was historically identified with the upper classes, and with the rural gentry, Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple (1881 – 1944) was both a prolific theologian and a social activist, preaching Christian socialism and taking an active role in the Labour Party until 1921.Adrian Hastings, \\"Temple, William (1881–1944)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/36454 He advocated a broad and inclusive membership in the Church of England as a means of continuing and expanding the church's position as the established church. He became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1942, and the same year he published Christianity and Social Order. The best-seller attempted to marry faith and socialism—by \\"socialism\\" he meant a deep concern for the poor. The book helped solidify Anglican support for the emerging welfare state. Temple was troubled by the high degree of animosity inside, and between the leading religious groups in Britain. He promoted ecumenicism, working to establish better relationships with the Nonconformists, Jews and Catholics, managing in the process to overcome his anti-Catholic bias.Dianne Kirby, \\"Christian co-operation and the ecumenical ideal in the 1930s and 1940s.\\" European Review of History 8#1 (2001): 37-60.F. A. Iremonger, William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury: His Life and Letters (1948) pp 387-425. online ===Gambling=== The experience of total war 1939 to 1945 meant much less leisure and highly restricted transportation, So attendance fell at gambling venues such as racing tracks for horses and dogs. However the amount of betting stayed high. Anti-gambling organizations other opportunity to use the national emergency to shut down many legitimate gambling activities, but the early successes in curtailing horse racing, dog racing and football—which were the main topics of gambling—were soon reversed as the government saw gambling as a necessary psychological outlet in a time of highly restricted leisure opportunities. The renewed opportunities as well, such as 'unity' football pools and a larger number of illegal neighborhood bookmakers. For the first time there was heavy gambling on Irish horse races, which were not interrupted during the war. The government provided extra petrol needed for the movement of racing horses and dogs.Mike Huggins, \\"Sports gambling during the Second World War: a British entertainment for critical times or a national evil?.\\" International Journal of the History of Sport 32.5 (2015): 667-683. ==Women Mobilisation === Salvage – \\"Up Housewives and at 'em! Put out your paper, metal, bones.\\" Artist: Yates-Wilson. Historians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilising the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.Robin Havers, The Second World War: Europe, 1939–1943 (2002) Volume 4, p 75 Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.Hancock, W.K. and Gowing, M.M. British War Economy (1949) The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control.Arthur Marwick, Britain in the Century of Total War: Peace and Social Change, 1900–67 (1968), p. 258 In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions.Calder, The People's War: Britain, 1939–45 (1969) pp 276–83. Parents had much less time to supervise their children, and there were fears of juvenile delinquency, especially as older teenagers took jobs and emulated their older siblings in the service. The government responded by requiring all young people over 16 to register, and expanded the number of clubs and organisations available to them.Marwick, Britain in the Century of Total War: Peace and Social Change, 1900–67 (1968), pp. 292–94, 258 ==See also== * Ministry of Information (United Kingdom) * History of the United Kingdom during the First World War * United States home front during World War II * London in World War II ==NotesFurther reading== * Addison, Paul. \\"The Impact of the Second World War,\\" in Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds.

This ship was ordered to be built at Brest Dockyard on 19 July 1692, to bear the name Terrible, to replace the previous ship bearing that name destroyed at La Hogue in June 1692. The designer and builder was Blaise Pangalo. Pangalo's ship was laid down in August 1692, launched on 21 February 1693 and completed in May 1693. She was initially armed with 100 guns, comprising twenty-eight 36-pounders on the lower deck, twenty-eight 18-pounders on the middle deck, twenty-eight 8-pounders on the upper deck, ten 6-pounders on the quarterdeck and six 6-pounders on the forecastle. In 1706 two extra 18-pounders were added on the middle deck, the 8-pounders on the upper deck were replaced by 12-pounders, and two more 6-pounders were added on the quarterdeck, giving her 104 guns. The new ship took part in the Battle of Lagos on 28 June 1693, where she was the flagship of Lieutenant-Général Louis François de Rousselet de Bourbon, Marquis de Châteaurenault, and at the Battle of Vélez-Málaga on 24 August 1704, where she was the flagship of Lieutenant-Général Ferdinand, Comte de Relingue. She was scuttled in Toulon on Louis's orders in July 1707 to avoid being set alight by the bombardment by the English fleet. She was later put back afloat, but in August 1714 she was condemned, and was sold to be taken to pieces during 1714. ==References== * *Nomenclature des Vaisseaux du Roi-Soleil de 1661 a 1715.

It was first released as a developer preview on March 7, 2018, and was released publicly on August 6, 2018. , 26.06% of Android devices run Pie (API 28), making it the second-most used version of Android. ==History== Android Pie, then referred to as \\"Android P\\", was first announced by Google on March 7, 2018, and the first developer preview was released on the same day. The second preview, considered beta quality, was released on May 8, 2018. The third preview, called Beta 2, was released on June 6, 2018. The fourth preview, called Beta 3, was released on July 2, 2018. The final beta of Android P was released on July 25, 2018. On August 6, 2018, Google officially announced the final release of Android 9 under the title \\"Pie\\", with the update initially available for current Google Pixel devices, and releases for Android One devices and others to follow \\"later this year\\". The Essential Phone was the first third-party Android device to receive an update to Pie, notably coming day-and-date with its final release. The Sony Xperia XZ3 was the first device with Android Pie pre-installed. ===Custom distributions=== There are, as of August 2019, a handful of notable custom Android distributions (ROMs) of 9.0 Pie. ==FeaturesUser experience=== Android Pie utilizes a refresh of Google's \\"material design\\" language, unofficially referred to as \\"Material Design 2.0\\". The revamp provides more variance in aesthetics, encouraging the creation of custom \\"themes\\" for the base guidelines and components rather than a standardized appearance. Bottom-aligned navigation bars are also more prominent. As applied to Android Pie's interface, rounded corners (influenced by the proprietary Google theme used by in-house software implementing Material Design 2.0) are more prominent. In addition, Pie contains official support for screen cutouts (\\"notches\\"), including APIs and system behaviors depending on their size and position. Android certification requirements restrict devices to two cutouts, which may only be along the top or bottom of the screen. The most significant user interface change on Pie is a redesigned on-screen navigation bar. Unlike previous versions of Android, it only consists of a slim home button, and a back button rendered only when available. The bar utilizes gesture navigation: swiping up opens the \\"Overview\\" screen, a redesign of the existing recent apps menu. Swiping the handle to the right activates application switching. The gesture bar is used primarily on new devices such as the Pixel 3; existing devices may either use the previous navigation key setup or offer the ability to opt into gesture navigation. As opposed to the previous recent apps menu, Overview utilizes a horizontal layout rather than vertical, and text may also be selected and copied from apps appearing there (although this uses OCR rather than the native text as to conserve resources). The Pixel Launcher exclusively supports the ability to access the app drawer and most recently used apps from the overview as well. However, this integration is proprietary, as there are no current plans to offer the necessary integration to third-party software due to security concerns. In addition, when rotation lock is enabled, rotating the device causes a screen rotation button to appear on the navigation bar. The notification area was redesigned, with the clock moved to the left, and the number of icons that may be displayed at once limited to four, in order to accommodate displays that may have \\"notch\\" cutouts in the center. The drop- down panels attached to quick settings items have been removed; long-pressing a toggle directs users to the relevant settings screen. Notifications for chats can now be threaded, displaying previous messages within (complementing the existing inline reply functionality). If a particular type of notification is frequently dismissed, the user will now be offered to disable it. The Do Not Disturb mode has been overhauled with a larger array of settings. The power menu now contains a screenshot button (which itself now supports cropping an image after taking one), and an optional \\"lockdown\\" mode that disables biometric unlock methods. The volume pop-up now only controls media volume, as well as the choice of sound, vibrate, or silent modes for notifications. Users are directed to the settings menu to change the volume of notifications. A magnifier display has been added to text selection, and \\"smart linkify\\" offers access to relevant apps if particular types of text (such as phone numbers or addresses) are highlighted. ===Platform=== Android Pie introduces a major change to power management, using algorithms to prioritize background activity by apps based on long-term usage patterns and predictions, dividing apps into \\"Active\\", \\"Working Set\\" (run often), \\"Frequent\\", \\"Rare\\", and \\"Never\\". Similar \\"adaptive brightness\\" settings are adjusted automatically based on detected lighting conditions. Both of these features were developed in collaboration with DeepMind. The \\"PrecomputedText\\" API (also available as a compatibility library compatible with Android 4.0 and newer) can be used to perform text display processing in a background thread as opposed to a UI thread to improve performance. The fingerprint authentication API has also been revamped to account for different types of biometric authentication experiences (including face scanning and in-screen fingerprint readers). Android Runtime can now create compressed bytecode files, and profiler data can be uploaded to Google Play servers to be bundled with apps when downloaded by users with a similar device. Apps targeting older Android API levels (beginning with Android 4.2) display a warning when launched. Google Play Store is now requiring all apps to target an API level released within the past year, and will also mandate 64-bit support in 2019. Android Pie supports IEEE 802.11mc, including Wi-Fi Round Trip Time for location positioning. The camera API now supports accessing multiple cameras at once. Apps may no longer perform background audio or video recording unless they run a foreground service. There is support for the High Efficiency Image File Format (subject to patent licensing and hardware support) and VP9 Profile 2. DNS over TLS is supported under the name \\"Private DNS\\". Android Go for Android Pie uses less storage than the previous release, and has enhancements to security and storage tracking. ==Reception== Shortly after its launch, several users on Pixel devices and the Essential Phone noted a decrease in battery life. As Android Pie became available to more phones, some users on various devices reported similar comparisons. ==See also== * Android version history ==References * Category:2018 software Category:Android (operating system) ","title":"Android Pie"},{"id":"56775185","text":"Stadion u Lugu is a football stadium in Kolašin, Montenegro.

He lives and works in Brussels (Belgium) and in Viens (France). Yves Zurstrassen's painting is a work always in motion, navigating between lyrical abstraction and abstract expressionism. His approach plays with the general principle of collage and “décollage” of various types of thin paper on successive layers of colour. == Biography == Yves Zurstrassen was born in Liège in 1956. After a childhood in the Vesdre valley (between the Ardennes and Hautes Fagnes) he left Verviers at the age of 10 with his family to settle in Brussels following the decline of the wool industry. A more turbulent period followed for the adolescent, between the hippie movement and truancy, with one certainty: his world was in painting. At the age of 18 he started to paint, alternating studio work with long periods of work in France, in the charterhouse of La Verne, or in Andalusia, where he painted outdoors. His work was highly influenced by these stays. He exhibited for the first time in Brussels in 1982. A self-taught painter with training in the graphic arts, he learned his craft in the 80s among the artists’ studios and retrospectives of the masters of abstract expressionism, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Cy Twombly and Mark Tobey, in opposition to the standard idea at that time in France of the death of painting. Zurstrassen deliberately chose to focus on the rectangle of the painting, with only the stretchers, the canvas, paper, and paint, to seek new freedom of expression.in Yves Zurstrassen peintre, a film by Michele Porte At the end of the 90s he settled in a disused industrial building that he adapted to his work and studies. Starting in the 2000s his approach evolved, inspired also by his love of the Dada movement, of Kurt Schwitters; at first through small format studies that occupied a more important place in his work; his technique was enhanced by collages of torn, cut-out newsprint integrated into the picture and then detached, removing the paint. He says that he opens windows in the memory of the picture. He integrates into these collages shapes cut from photos that he takes in the public space, urban motifs or details of everyday life, and digitally reworks, as in the monumental (94 m) work installed in the Gare de l'Ouest [Brussels- West Station] in Brussels in 2009.STIB, L'art à Bruxelles passe aussi par le Métro, STIB-Communication, Albe de Coker, 2012, p.167 The beginning of the 2010 decade saw the cut-out motifs, which at the beginning were placed on the surface of the composition, change place to completely cover the background.Anne Pontégnie, A Year in Painting, Galérie Valérie Bach, 2014.

Ghose was the first female filmmaker from the state of Odisha. ==Early life== Ghose, who was one of eight siblings, was born as Chapala Nayak on 28 March 1933 in Manasinghpatana, Cuttack district, Odisha, British India.Her father, Basudev Naik, managed the Manmohan Press, a prominent book publisher. Ghose attended Sanat Nalini Girls High School. She also trained as a dancer under Kelucharan Mohapatra, Dayal Sharma, and Suresh Routray. ==Career== She began her career as a child voice actor on All India Radio before transitioning to on-screen film roles. She made her film debut as child artist of character Nila Madhav in 1949 film, Shri Jagannath. Her big break came in the 1953 film Amari Gaan Jhua (Our Village Girl), where she was cast as the female lead actress. Amari Gaan Jhua, which explored the controversial practice of child marriage, won her positive reviews. In 1956, Parbati Ghose appeared as the lead actress in the successful Odia language film, Bhai Bhai, alongside her future husband, Gour Prasad Ghose, who was also the producer. Bhai Bhai, which showcased her prowess as a lead actress, greatly increased her profile in the Indian film industry. It also led to her interest in film directing and production. Thereafter Ghose appeared in Maa in 1959, also produced by Gour Prasad Ghose. Parbati Ghose and her husband produced, co-directed and acted in Lakshmi (1962 film),Kaa (1965 film),Stree (1968 film). These three films won them three national film awards for their work as a directors and producers. A few years later, she produced and directed Chha Mana Atha Guntha in 1986.She had worked in Hindi and Bengali language Telefilms like ‘Prashna’ and ‘Sopan’. Her last film as a director and producer was Salabega in 1998. ==Personal life== In 1959, she married Gourprasad Ghose and adopted the name Parbati Ghose, given to her by her new in-laws. She continued to appear in films throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including Lakshmi in 1962, Kaa in 1965, Stree in 1968 and Sansaar in 1971. ==Death== Ghose succumbed to SCD (Sudden Cardiac Death) on February 11, 2018, at the age of 84. The state government of Odisha held a state funeral in her honor. Naveen Patnaik, the Chief Minister of Orissa, paid tribute to Parbati Ghose and her contributions to the local and national film industry, noting that \\"She was an actor, director and producer at the same time. In early days of Odia cinema, she single-handedly uplifted it to a new level. She was really a symbol of women's empowerment when an idea like empowerment was unheard of. Her departure is a great loss to our industry and the world of silver screen. She will always be remembered for her contribution to Odia cinema.\\" ==References * Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Indian women filmmakers Category:Indian film actresses Category:Indian radio actresses Category:Indian women film directors Category:Indian women film producers Category:Film directors from Odisha Category:Film producers from Odisha Category:Odia film directors Category:Odia film producers Category:20th-century Indian film directors Category:Women artists from Odisha Category:20th-century Indian women artists Category:People from Cuttack district Category:Businesswomen from Odisha ","title":"Parbati Ghose"},{"id":"56775481","text":"Ethel Rosenfield (1910 - 2000) was a Polish-born Canadian sculptor who lived in Montreal, Quebec. After enrolling in art classes in her mid-forties, she began working primarily in limestone and marble, exploring \\"organic forms, abstract or schematized, the latter representing faces and female bodies\\". Rosenfield co-founded the Quebec Sculptors' Association in 1962, and her work was exhibited at the Rodin Museum, Expo 67, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and multiple Canadian universities. Her sculptures are held in permanent collections at Concordia University, the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, and the Storm-King Art Centre. == Biography == Rosenfield was born in 1910 in Kodoc, Poland. She came to Montreal in 1919. Rosenfield later had two children: a daughter and a son. After she turned 45 and her children were older, she began studying sculpting at the École des Beaux-Arts. Joking about her late start in life as a sculptor, Rosenfield's husband liked to call her \\"Montreal's Grandma Moses\\". Her teachers included Quebec sculptors Armand Filion, Sylvia Daoust and Louis Archambault. Rosenfield was one of the founding members of the Quebec Sculptors' Association in 1962. Although she sometimes worked in wood and bronze, Rosenfield primarily worked in stone, including limestone from Indiana and marble from Carrara, Verona and Quebec. Rosenfield's style as a sculptor often focused on \\"organic forms, abstract or schematized, the latter representing faces and female bodies\\". Her work was exhibited at the Musée Rodin in Paris, and in group exhibitions at the Place des Arts, the Thomas More Institute, Sir George Williams University, University of Waterloo, University of Sherbrooke, National Arts Centre, Expo 67, Musee d’Art Contemporaine, and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Rosenfield offered mentorship and support to younger artists such as Ora Markstein, a Holocaust survivor from Hungary who immigrated to Canada in the mid-1970s. Upon seeing some photographs of Markstein's earlier plaster sculptures, Rosenfield told her: \\"But you are thinking in stone! You feel in stone!\\". Encouraging her to take classes in stone sculpting, Rosenfield arranged for Markstein to receive a scholarship at the Saidye Bronfman Centre. Rosenfield moved to Toronto in 1978. She died in 2000 in Scarborough, Ontario. Her sculpture is included in various public and private collections, including Concordia University, the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal and the Storm King Art Center. == References == Category:1910 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Canadian women sculptors Category:Polish emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Artists from Montreal Category:Polish women sculptors Category:Expo 67 Category:École des beaux-arts de Montréal alumni Category:20th-century Polish sculptors Category:20th-century Canadian sculptors Category:20th-century Canadian women artists ","title":"Ethel Rosenfield"},{"id":"56775485","text":"Achaea mezentia Achaea mezentia is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Caspar Stoll in 1780.

Diagram demonstrating cable bacteria metabolism in surface sediment. Hydrogen sulfide (HS) is oxidized in the sulfidic sediment layer, and the resulting electrons (e−) are conducted up through the cable bacteria filament to the oxic layer and used to reduce molecular oxygen (O). Cable bacteria are filamentous bacteria that conduct electricity across distances over 1 cm in sediment and groundwater aquifers. Cable bacteria allow for long distance electron transport, which connects electron donors to electron acceptors, connecting previously separated oxidation and reduction reactions. Cable bacteria couple the reduction of oxygen or nitrate at the sediment's surface to the oxidation of sulfide in the deeper, anoxic, sediment layers. ==Discovery== Long-distance electrical conductance in sediment was first observed in 2010 as a spatial separation of sulfide oxidation and oxygen reduction in marine sediment that was interrupted and re-established at a rate faster than could be explained by chemical diffusion. It was later found that this electrical conductance could be observed across a non-conductive layer of glass microspheres, where the only possible conductive structures were filamentous bacteria belonging to the family Desulfobulbaceae. The conductivity of single, live filaments was later demonstrated by observing the oxidation state of cytochromes using Raman microscopy. The same phenomenon was later observed in freshwater sediments and groundwater aquifers. Within a 15 cm thick top layer of sediment, cable bacteria densities providing total length of up to 2 km per square centimeter of surface have been observed. ==Morphology== Cable bacteria filaments are 0.4—1.7 µm in diameter and up to 15 mm long. Filaments consist of rod-shaped cells with an average length of 3 µm. Filaments are long strings composed of cells stacked together, and can be as long as 30-70mm. Some filaments are composed of upwards of 10,000 cells. Each cell has between 15 and 54 ridges, and ridges span the entire length of the filament. These ridges are hypothesized to contain the cells' conductive structures. === Junctions === Cells in a filament are connected by junctions. The diameter of junctions between cells in the filament varies from being smaller than the cell diameter, the same diameter as the cells on either side of the junction, or bulging out to become wider than the cell diameter. Junctions are able to withstand more force without breaking than the cells themselves. Cells on opposite sides of each junction are separated; if one cell bursts, the cell on the other side of the junction will remain intact. === Strings === Cable bacteria contain structures known as strings. Strings are located inside of ridges on the outer membrane and connect one cell to the next. Strings span the length of the entire filament uninterrupted. The width of the strings is about 20-40 nm. The size and function of a string is similar to that of a microtubule. Strings are thought to serve as a structural foundation for filaments and play a key role in maintaining filament shape, especially during growth. == Distribution == Cable bacteria are generally found in reduced sediments. They can be present as a single filament or as an agglomeration of filaments. Cable bacteria have been identified as being intertwined with the root hairs of aquatic plants and are present in the rhizosphere. Their distribution ranges a gradient of salinities; they are present in freshwater, saltwater lakes, and marine habitats. Cable bacteria have been identified in a diverse range of climatic conditions worldwide, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan, Australia, and the United States. ==Motility== Cable bacteria lack flagella, but are capable of motility in the form of gliding by propelling themselves forward through the excretion of substances. Cable bacteria have been observed to move as fast as 2.2 µm/s, with an average speed of 0.5 µm/s. Speed of motility in cable bacteria is not related to size of the bacteria. The average distance a cable bacterium glides is approximately 74 µm without interruption. Cable bacteria filaments tend to bend in half, and their movement is led by the apex of the bend as opposed to leading with one tip of the filament. Twisting to move through rotational gliding is rare, but does occur. Cable bacteria likely engage in oxygen chemotaxis, as they are observed to move when in anoxic or hypoxic environments, and cease gliding when contact with oxygen is made. Although motility is important for other microorganisms, once cable bacteria are located in a place that connects oxygen to sulfide, they no longer need to move. The reduced need for motility could explain why the cable bacteria genome contains less operons related to chemotaxis than other Desulfobulbaceae. Less operons related to chemotaxis results in limited motility. ==Taxonomy== Two candidate genera of cable bacteria have been described: Electrothrix containing four candidate species, found in marine or brackish sediments, and Electronema containing two candidate species, found in freshwater sediments. Freshwater and marine cable bacteria have been found to be 88% similar based on 16S ribosomal RNA comparisons. These genera are classified within the family Desulfobulbaceae. According to last common ancestor analysis, cable bacteria likely descended from Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Chromatiales, and Thiotrichales. Cable bacteria are defined by their function rather than their phylogeny, and it is possible that further cable bacteria taxa will be discovered. ==Ecological significance== Cable bacteria strongly influence the geochemical properties of the surrounding environment. Their activity promotes the oxidation of iron at the surface of the sediment, and the resulting iron oxides bind phosphorus- containing compounds and hydrogen sulfide, limiting the amount of phosphorus and hydrogen sulfide in the water. Phosphorus can cause eutrophication, and hydrogen sulfide can be toxic to marine life, meaning that cable bacteria play an important role in maintaining marine ecosystems in coastal areas. === Methane emissions === The presence of cable bacteria can lead to a decrease in methane emissions from saturated soils. The transfer of electrons through cable bacteria allows the sulfate reduction that occurs in inundated soils to be balanced by sulfate oxidation. Oxidation is possible because of the release of electrons through the cable bacteria filaments. Through this balance, sulfate remains readily available for sulfate reducing bacteria, which out compete methanogens. This causes a decrease in production of methane by methanogens. ==Practical applications== Cable bacteria have been found associated with benthic microbial fuel cells, devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy. In the future, cable bacteria may play a role in increasing the efficiency of microbial fuel cells. Cable bacteria have also been found associated with a bioelectrochemical system for degrading contaminating hydrocarbons in marine sediment and thus may play a role in future oil spill cleanup technologies. == See also == * Biodegradable electronics == References  External links == * Category:Microorganisms Category:Bacteria Category:Environmental microbiology ","title":"Cable bacteria"},{"id":"56775492","text":"Charlotte Lachs (1867–1920) was a Swedish-American soprano singer of Bavarian descent. With repertoire including composers such as Johannes Brahms, Hermann Berens, and Carl Czerny, she performed across Europe and America. ==Biography== Charlotte Lachs was born May 21, 1867 in Lindesberg, Sweden, to Friedrichs Lachs, a Bavarian brewmaster who had immigrated to Sweden in 1860, and Fredrika (née Lorentzon). Her siblings included Alice Brauner, and Charles Lachs, a visual artist.Södermalm med omnejd i bilder av Charles Lachs (, Stockholmia förlag 2009), by Alice Rasmussen For her studies, Charlotte Lachs relocated to her family home region where she was admitted to the Royal Conservatory of Music of Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria. Among her teachers were Bernhard Fexer, Hugo Beyer, and Professor Hans Hasselbeck, the latter who considered her \\"an artist of great technical ability\\". After a concert with the Swedish glee club in Tammany Hall, New York City, Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that \\"still yet old Sweden is capable of sending out nightingales into the world, songbirds in whose soft and fresh tones equivalents are yet to be found\\". Charlotte Lachs' multiple concerts across Europe and America made her a singer of \\"remarkble talent and diligence\\" with a voice \\"very fine sonorous and sympathetic\\" of \\"great sweetness, fullness, and carrying power\\", having the \\"richness of a contralto\\". Her \\"captivating\\", \\"dramatic fervor\\" of a \\"true artist\\" had her compared to Emma Albani, and Niels Gade spoke of her \\"in lavish terms of praise\\". Singing Giacomo Meyerbeer, one account noted that \\"she could sing so difficult an aria with such accuracy, such artless, bird-like freedom in trill and cadenza, shows a very high degree of careful and thorough training of the best sort\\". Charlotte Lachs was also active as music pedagogue, instructing among others Fanny zu Reventlow. Eventually, she would permanently reside in the United States, where she married Frederic Lillebridge, professor at New York College of Music. Lachs was appointed directress of the departments of vocal music at the Conservatory of Music of Mount Allison University, of Belmont University, of Minnesota State University, as well as of Texas Woman's College, the future merger of Texas Wesleyan University.

It is located in the Historic centre of Córdoba, northeast of the Mezquita Catedral (the Mosque-Cathedral), in the area of the following streets : Deanes, Manríquez, Tomás Conde, Judíos, Almanzor and Romero. It is one of the most visited areas by tourists given that, besides the Mosque, you can see monuments such as the Sinagoga (Synagogue), the Zoco Municipal (Zoco Municipal Market) or the Museo Taurino (Bull-fighting Museum), among others. It is part of the historic centre of Córdoba which was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994. == Calle de la judería de Córdoba (Jewish Quarter of Córdoba Street) == Córdoba went through a period when three peoples (Christian, Jewish and Muslim) and their respective religions lived together, albeit, the non-Muslim population living subjugated under Islamic Law with Jews having their own court system. Walking through the Jewish Quarter, along the Calle de los Judíos (Jewish Street), visitors can now find a magnificent bronze statue dedicated to Maimónides, the great Jewish philosopher and doctor from Córdoba. During this period, the majority of the Jewish people lived under the rule of Islam. During the four years of Umayyad hegemony, cultural, artistic and commercial Muslim activities turned Al-Ándalus (Muslim Spain) into the most cultured country in Europe. Historians talk of Córdoba with admiration, the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate, which turned into a magnificent cultural centre with its lakes and parks, amazing palaces and mosques. The court attracted and exercised its patronage over poets and philosophers, men of literature and science. During the 10th century, Córdoba was the largest economic and cultural centre of the Western world. In 756 AD, the Umayyad Abd-al-Rahman I, turned Córdoba into the capital of Muslim Spain and during the following 250 years it turned into one of the largest commercial and intellectual centres in the world. In 929 AD, Abd-al-Rahman III, proclaimed the caliphate and the city reached its highest splendour, rivalling Damascus and Baghdad, centres of great economic and intellectual prosperity. From the 11th century, due to the disintegration of Muslim power in Spain, part of the cultural success of Córdoba was lost, although it remained a centre for people of literature and scholars. In the 12th century, the actions of philosophers Averroes and Maimónides stand out. In 1236, Fernando III el Santo (The Saint) took the city and integrated it into the Kingdom of Castile. == See also == * Historic Centre of Córdoba * Córdoba Synagogue == References == * Category:Córdoba, Spain Category:Neighbourhoods in Spain ","title":"Judería de Córdoba"},{"id":"56775558","text":"The Great Wall SoCool is a Pickup truck produced by Great Wall Motors. ==Overview== The Great Wall SoCool is the high version of the Great Wall Sailor and just like the Sailor, the body of the Great Wall SoCool was the third generation Isuzu Faster produced under license sharing a front end with the Great Wall Pegasus and styled completely different from the cheaper Great Wall Sailor.

Together with Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen, from 1873 she ran a retail business in Copenhagen, selling embroidered goods and training young women to sew. The business proved to be highly successful over the next 30 years, attracting custom from individuals, churches and schools, and receiving several international awards. It closed in 1903 to enable Bindesbøll and her colleague Konstantin-Hansen to create large tapestries for Frederiksborg Castle. ==Biography== Born on 5 January 1851 in Aarhus, Karen Johanne Bindesbøll was the daughter of the Golden Age architect Michael Gottlieb Birckner Bindesbøll (1800–56) and Andrea Frederikke Andersen (1819–99). She was brought up in an architectural environment in which decorative art and textiles played an important part. She was taught drawing and embroidery at home, frequently with the help of the artistic women who came to visit. After her father's early death, it became necessary for Johanne and her elder sister Maria (1849–1915) to develop their sewing skills as a means of earning an income. Her younger brother, Thorvald (1846–1908), who became a designer and an architect, often prepared their designs and patterns. The family continued to enjoy close contacts with the cultural families of the day, especially those who befriended the painter P.C. Skovgaard. Pattern designed by Johanne Bindesbøll and Konstantin-Hansen Together with Konstantin-Hansen, in 1873 she opened a business on Købmagergade in central Copenhagen. They were later joined by Anna Sarauw and by Johanne's sister, Marie. The shop thrived on its good selection of patterns and materials, complemented by the expertise of the women who ran it. Bindesbøll was recognized for the efficient way she dealt with difficult customers. She was also a strong supporter of Danish embroidery traditions in comparison with those from Germany. Many of their patterns were based on the artwork of P.C. Skovgaard, Constantin Hansen, and Thorvald Bindesbøll. In 1900, Bindesbøll and Konstantin-Hansen were commissioned to recreate the tapestries from Frederiksborg Castle which had been destroyed in the 1859 fire. After carrying out substantial research, they embarked on the task in 1903. After Konstantin-Hansen died in 1925, Bindesbøll completed the work in 1928. Johanne Bindesbøll died on 9 July 1934 in Copenhagen and is buried in Frederiksberg Ældre Kirkegård. ==References== Category:1851 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:19th-century Danish artists Category:Danish embroiderers Category:Danish women artists Category:Danish textile artists Category:19th-century women textile artists Category:19th-century textile artists ","title":"Johanne Bindesbøll"},{"id":"56775809","text":"Gordana Lazarevich (born 1939) is a Canadian pianist, musicologist and former department head at the University of Victoria. == Career == Lazarevich became director of the School of Music at the University of Victoria in 1986.

The Regents' general counsel stated they did not believe the allegation was supported by evidence, and that the university would seek redress through the trial court and at the appellate level. Conney won the suit and was awarded $4.06 million in March 2007. The California Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal filed by the Regents of the University of California. The judge also awarded $515,450 in attorney’s fees. With interest and appellate attorney’s fees, the total award over $4 million. During the 9-day jury trial (because UCLA did not want to settle the initial claim of unfair pay), many professors and even the chairman of the department at UCLA testified. Many of their statements contradicted their own depositions, which had been taken about 4 months before the trial. Under oath, the professors testified there was a separate pot of money that the men received, in addition to their base salary. This was one of many incriminating pieces of testimony to which the jury agreed that Dr. Conney had been discriminated against on the basis of her gender. Another part of the award was for interference with current and also future pay and promotion. -Janet Cynthia Conney, MD == See also == *University of California v.

Consider a social network in which people (agents) hold a belief or opinion about the state of something in the world, such as the quality of a particular product, the effectiveness of a public policy, or the reliability of a news agency. In all these settings, people learn about the state of the world via observation or communication with others. Models of social learning try to formalize these interactions to describe how agents process the information received from their friends in the social network. Some of the main questions asked in the literature include: #whether agents reach a consensus; #whether social learning effectively aggregates scattered information, or put differently, whether the consensus belief matches the true state of the world or not; #how effective media sources, politicians, and prominent agents can be in belief formation of the entire network. In other words, how much room is there for belief manipulation and misinformation? ==Bayesian learning== Bayesian learning is a model which assumes that agents update their beliefs using Bayes' rule. Indeed, each agent's belief about different states of the world can be seen as a probability distribution over a set of opinions, and Bayesian updating assumes that this distribution is updated in a statistically optimal manner using Bayes' rule. Moreover, Bayesian models typically make certain demanding assumptions about agents, e.g., that they have a reliable model of the world and that the social learning rule of each agent is common knowledge among all members of the community. More rigorously, let the underlying state be θ. This parameter could correspond to an opinion among people about a certain social, economic, or political issue. At first, each individual has a prior probability of θ which can be shown by P(θ). This prior could be a result of the agents' personal observations of the world. Then each person updates their belief by receiving some signal s. According to the Bayesian approach, the updating procedure will follow this rule: P(\\\\thetas) = \\\\frac{P(s\\\\theta)}{P(s)} \\\\cdot P(\\\\theta) where the term \\\\textstyle P(s\\\\theta) is the conditional probability over signal space given the true state of the world. ==Non-Bayesian learning== Bayesian learning is often considered the benchmark model for social learning, in which individuals use Bayes' rule to incorporate new pieces of information to their belief. However, it has been shown that such a Bayesian \\"update\\" is fairly sophisticated and imposes an unreasonable cognitive load on agents which might not be realistic for human beings. Therefore, scientists have studied simpler non-Bayesian models, most notably the DeGroot model, introduced by DeGroot in 1974, which is one the very first models for describing how humans interact with each other in a social network. In this setting, there is a true state of the world, and each agent receives a noisy independent signal from this true value and communicates with other agents repeatedly. According to the DeGroot model, each agent takes a weighted average of their neighbors' opinions at each step to update their own belief. The statistician George E. P. Box once said, \\"All models are wrong; however, some of them are useful.\\" Along the same lines, the DeGroot model is a fairly simple model but it can provide us with useful insights about the learning process in social networks. Indeed, the simplicity of this model makes it tractable for theoretical studies. Specifically, we can analyze different network structure to see for which structures these naive agents can successfully aggregate decentralized information. Since the DeGroot model can be considered a Markov chain, provided that a network is strongly connected (so there is a direct path from any agent to any other) and satisfies a weak aperiodicity condition, beliefs will converge to a consensus. When consensus is reached, the belief of each agent is a weighted average of agents' initial beliefs. These weights provide a measure of social influence. In the case of a converging opinion dynamic, the social network is called wise if the consensus belief is equal to the true state of the world. It can be shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for wisdom is that the influence of the most influential agent vanishes as the network grows. The speed of convergence is irrelevant to the wisdom of the social network. ==Empirical evaluation of models== Along with the theoretical framework for modeling social learning phenomenon, there has been a great amount of empirical research to assess the explanatory power of these models. In one such experiment, 665 subjects in 19 villages in Karnataka, India, were studied while communicating information with each other to learn the true state of the world. This study attempted to distinguish between two most prominent models of information aggregation in social networks, namely, Bayesian learning and DeGroot learning. The study showed that agents' aggregate behavior is statistically significantly better described by the DeGroot learning model. ==References== Category:Social learning theory Category:Bayesian inference ","title":"Mathematical models of social learning"},{"id":"56775943","text":"Tropidacris cristata Taeniopoda reticulata Romaleinae is a subfamily of lubber grasshoppers in the family Romaleidae, found in North and South America.

Prior to philosophy, Carlino founded Bio Medic, a medically based skin care line created for distribution in clinical settings by plastic surgeons and dermatologists. philosophy products were inspired by years of medical research that helped to shape the skin care treatments, peels and protocols offered in medical practices. ===1990s=== philosophy launched at a press event on March 21, 1996, at the Rainbow Room in New York City, New York. The first product available was purity made simple, a facial cleanser that the brand continues to offer. It was available exclusively at Barneys New York before being offered in other retailers such as Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue. Shortly thereafter, Carlino appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show to promote philosophy; Winfrey would continue to be a fan and brand evangelist, with her baby picture being featured on a special 15th anniversary edition of hope in a jar, the brand’s moisturizer. philosophy’s first fragrance, amazing grace, also made its debut that year followed by its second fragrance, pure grace. In 1997, philosophy launched their in-home peel product—a new concept for retail cosmetics at the time. French cosmetics store chain Sephora began to stock philosophy in 1998. In 1999, the brand expanded into bath products including shampoo, shower gel and bubble baths. By the end of the ‘90s, philosophy became the first skin care brand to partner with home-shopping retailer QVC. ===2000s=== Particularly through home-shopping television sales, philosophy debuted “super-sized” versions of several items in 2000. In 2003, the brand expanded into fragrances with the falling in love line. The decade also saw the publication of a branded cookbook and the release of skin care kits designed to target damage, specific skin conditions or concerns, such as acne or anti-aging. In 2005, the brand launched shower for the cure, a multitasking bath product that could be used as a shampoo, shower gel or bubble bath, with all net proceeds given to the Women’s Cancer Research Fund. In 2007, philosophy was acquired by The Carlyle Group for an estimated $450 million. ===2010s=== Coty, Inc. acquired philosophy from The Carlyle Group in late 2010 in a deal that was valued at approximately $1 billion. One of the goals of this acquisition was to expand the Coty portfolio with an entry into the luxury skin care market. After acquiring the philosophy brand, Cody revamped the original fragrance, Amazing Grace, which negatively changed the fragrance, causing thousands of loyal customers to complain and boycott not only the Amazing Grace products, but the brand in its entirely. Even after many years of loyal customer complaints across numerous retail channels, Cody has not returned to the original formula of the Amazing Grace fragrance as of 2020. In 2014, philosophy released an updated version of their hope in a jar line: renewed hope in a jar; it debuted domestically, then launched globally in selected European and Asian markets. Soon to follow were several more additions to the philosophy skin care line, including ultimate miracle worker, uplifting miracle worker and take a deep breath, which includes day and nighttime moisturizers and an eye cream. 2016 saw the opening of the freestanding flagship philosophy retail store in Paramus, NJ. ==Products== Though initially founded as a skin care line, philosophy has since expanded into color cosmetics, fragrance and bath and body products. Each product includes an inspirational name and saying on the packaging. ==Charityhope & grace initiative=== In 2014, philosophy established the hope & grace initiative to help raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing topics. The majority of funding from the hope & grace initiative supports community-based mental health efforts. For every philosophy product sold in the US, the brand contributes 1% of sales to the hope and grace fund. Each year the hope and grace fund awards multiple grants to local organizations, including Bringchange2mind and NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), working toward promotion, prevention and treatment of women in need of mental healthcare. In 2017, the brand released a new national campaign and PSA to support the hope & grace initiative. ==EndorsementsOprah Winfrey=== Oprah Winfrey has been a long-time endorser of philosophy, starting shortly after the brand’s launch. In 2005, Winfrey gifted hope in a jar to an audience of Hurricane Katrina relief volunteers. In 2010, Winfrey included hope in a jar in her final Favorite Things list. philosophy honored Winfrey by including a picture of her as a baby on special edition packages of hope in a jar the same year ===Natasha Bedingfield=== In 2015, English singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield partnered with philosophy to support its hope & grace initiative. Bedingfield created an exclusive, original song, “Hope” for the brand ===Ellen Pompeo=== In 2016, American actress and Grey’s Anatomy star, Ellen Pompeo partnered with philosophy for the #CoolAger campaign, the goal of which was to help dispel the stigma women face over aging. The campaign also launched their uplifting miracle worker line of products.

Her youth at the time of her execution made her case unusual. == Life == Marie Lamont lived in Inverkip, a parish in the burgh of Renfrew in which persecution of witches was particularly rife between the years 1640–1690. At a young age she was accused of being a witch, and after confessing was presented for trial on 7 May 1662. === Background === Sir Archibald Stewart of Blackhall, Laird of Ardgowan had applied to the Privy Council for a Royal Enquiry into the practice of witchcraft in the Inverkip area. During this later period of witch persecution the right to assemble a number of commissions of justiciary was granted by the Privy Council to gentlemen in every county. The enquiries preceding the commissions of justiciary were supplementary to the regular enquiries instituted by the State and Church. The Royal Enquiry relevant to Marie Lamont appointed a commission of nine men, one of whom was Sir Archibald Stewart the Sheriff Depute of Perth- a man who was probably a relative of Sir Archibald Stewart the Younger of Blackhall. The other members of the commission were John Brisbane the Younger of Bishopton, Cornelius Crawford of Jordanhill, Alexander Cuningham of Craigends (a church elder), Sir George Maxwell of Nether Pollok, Hugh Montgomery of Silverwood (another Sheriff Depute), Robert Montgomery of Hazlehead, John Porterfield the Younger of that Ilk, and Archibald Stewart of Scotstown. Sir Archibald Stewart of Blackhall himself was not part of the commission but nevertheless was present at the trial. The Reverend John Hamilton, minister at Inverkip between 1626–1664, was also involved in Marie's case but is not listed as being part of the commission. The Rev Hamilton was known to be a 'zealous persecutor of witches'and by the end of his career had adopted a radical approach to Presbyterianism. A graduate minister of the time could enhance his prestige and show himself to be worthy of his hire by using his academic learning (learning being considered particularly important in cases of witchcraft) to protect the local community against Satan and his witch followers. The witch hunts in 17th century Scotland were sanctioned by the Witchcraft Act of 1563, which had made the practice of witchcraft a capital offence. Society at the time was strongly patriarchal, with women being generally oppressed. The usual victims of the hunts were female, and a commonly shared characteristic was a sharp tongue along with a lack of deference shown towards authority. Where the social class of the accused was known, most (64%) fell into the middle range; of the remainder 29% were in the lowest socioeconomic group and 6% the highest. The ages recorded showed the majority (75%) to have been between 30 and 60 years old. The torture and degradation to which the victims were subjected prior to the trial itself were often so severe that a confession was seen to be the best option for the accused, and execution would come as a release. By the time of Marie Lamont's trial the prerequisites for putting a person accused of witchcraft to trial had become more rigorous, and the Privy Council had stated that a confession must be voluntary and not obtained under torture. In June 1661, the year before Marie appeared before the Commission, the precondition was added that the accused must be \\"of compleat age\\", and by July 1662 had further added that the accused must not be subjected to pressure and must be of sound mind. The preconditions were open to interpretation at a local level where older views were still prevalent. Being troubled in conscience or having feelings of despair were viewed by Puritans as the emotional sign of the liminal stage between the life of sin and that of regeneration and thus the accused being in this state of mind could be interpreted as confirmation of guilt. ===Confession and execution=== Marie's trial was held in the locale and lasted for one day. At trial she freely admitted that she had become a witch at the age of 13 years, when under the influence of Catherine Scott she allegedly renounced her Christian faith, was baptised by the devil and renamed \\"Clowts\\". She confessed to having sexual relations with the devil several times when he appeared to her as a brown dog, and this had left marks on her right side where he had nipped her. She said that along with Jean King, Kattie Scott, Janet Holm and sundry others she had met at the bucht-gait of Ardgowan in the presence of the devil, who appeared to them on this occasion in the shape of a black man with cloven feet. They were directed to gather sand from the shore and scatter it about yetts of Ardgowan, and about the minister's house. She was accused of shape shifting into a cat and of stealing milk by means of magic. The milk theft involved drawing a tether made from the hair of many cows' tails over the mouth of a mug and speaking the words \\"In God's name, God send us milk, God send it, and meikle of it\\". Marie also confessed to dancing round the Kempock Stone with others and attempting to throw the stone into the sea, the intention being to sink ships sailing in the Firth of Clyde. The Kempock Stone, Gourock with the Firth of Clyde beyond On the same day and by the same commission five other women were tried for witchcraft. These women are named as Margaret Duff, Jonet (sic) Hynman, Margret (sic) Letch, Margret (sic) Rankin, and Kathrin Scott. Lawmont was burned at the stake in 1662, possibly outside the Auldkirk of Inverkip. == References == Category:17th- century Scottish women Category:1642 births Category:1662 deaths Category:People executed for witchcraft Category:People from Renfrew ","title":"Marie Lamont"},{"id":"56776113","text":"Line 7 drawn to scale.

Her business worked with WES to identify and employ female apprentices, including Beatrice Shilling. Partridge also helped campaign to change the International Labour Organisation convention on night work for women in 1934, after Shilling was found working on her own in a power station at night, thus contravening the existing regulations. == Early life and education == Margaret Partridge was born in Nymet Rowland, Devon on 8 April 1891. She was educated at Bedford High School, Bedford, and obtained the Arnott and Jane Benson scholarship to study mathematics at Bedford College, London from 1911, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1914. After graduating, Partridge initially tried teaching, before working for an engineering consultant in London where she found her true interest, working in engineering. == Engineering career == > 'Today a man met me in the road and threatened to cut down some wires > because he didn't like the look of them.'Correspondence with Caroline > Haslett, Institution of Engineering and Technology Archives, UK0108 NAEST > 033. In 1917, Partridge moved to the engineering company Arthur Lyon & Wrench, which manufactured searchlights. Taking advantage of the opportunities available to women working in industry during the First World War, she trained as an engineering apprentice and advanced to supervisor of the test department. At the end of the war, she decided to move back to the family home in Devon to set up her own electrical consulting business, M. Partridge & Co., Domestic Engineers, and advertised in the Women's Engineering Society's Journal The Woman Engineer under the slogan 'Women for Women's Work.' Her company soon expanded to bid for contracts to provide electricity supply for small towns and villages. She received a great deal of practical support and financial advice from Dr John Purves MIEE, an electrical engineer who would later advise on the electricity supply scheme for the whole of the west of England. Purves encouraged Partridge to set up electrical lighting companies for Cheriton Fitzpaine, Thorverton and Bampton where she brought electricity to the homes of the inhabitants for the first time. Although most residents were excited at the new developments, she also had to deal with complaints about rights of way and wires extending across properties and gardens. Partridge was a delegate at the first meeting to develop the Electrical Association for Women, held on 12 November 1924 at 1 Upper Brook Street, home of Lady Katharine Parsons. The attendees represented the great and good of the electrical and engineering world and a large number of influential women's organisations. The meeting heard a paper from Mrs. Mabel Lucy Matthews on her proposal for an organisation to help raise the burden of domestic drudgery from women through the use and increased availability of electricity. Following what was described as \\"a lively discussion\\", Partridge proposed a resolution, which was agreed unanimously, “…to form a Women’s Electrical Association” and wishing “to put on record its thanks to Mrs Matthews”. The name was soon changed to the Electrical Association for Women to avoid confusion with the acronym of the Workers’ Educational Association. Partridge decided to help young women who were interested in engineering as a career by offering apprenticeships specifically for young women leaving school. She wrote to Caroline Haslett asking for recommendations and was successful in appointing Beatrice Shilling who was an immediate success. Partridge and her partner, Margaret Rowbotham, encouraged Shilling to study at Manchester University and Shilling became a pioneering aeronautical engineer. It was Shilling who was discovered working on her own in a power station at night in contravention of the ILO Convention concerning Employment of Women during the Night (1919), which stated that women were not permitted to do any kind of industrial work at night. This case, with support from the Women's Engineering Society, eventually led to a change in the convention in 1934, exempting women who were working in a supervisory role. During World War II, Partridge was appointed as the Ministry of Labour Women's Technical Officer for the South West, advising factories on the employment of women in munitions. == Retirement and later work == Following her retirement. Partridge continued to live in Devon, with Margaret Rowbotham, and encouraged the members of her local Women's Institute to wire the village hall for electricity. The remains of both Margarets lie in Willand churchyard. == Work for the Women's Engineering Society == Partridge joined the Women's Engineering Society in 1920. She became Vice-President in 1942, and President in 1943. She succeeded Gertrude Entwistle in the role and was succeeded by Dr. Winifred Hackett in 1946.Celebrating Women in Engineering 1919-2019, The Women's Engineering Society == Commemoration == Blue plaque by Devon History Society at Margaret Partridge's former home in Willand, Devon.

V.A.M.C. was later named Virginia Polytechnic Institute And State University (Virginia Tech). Caldwell hiked as much as 28 miles through today's Jefferson National Forest in the Allegheny Mountains from Sinking Creek, Craig County to Blacksburg, Va. to enroll as the school's first student on October 1, 1872. == Early life == William Addison (\\"Add\\") Caldwell was born on January 10, 1856 in Sinking Creek, Craig County, VA as the second of George Charlton and Lorena Givens Caldwell's nine children. Generations of the Caldwell family had lived in the area beginning in the 1760s, when King George III of England granted land to their forebear, John Caldwell. Addison's father, George and grandfather, Archibald Caldwell were both farmers and lived in a 2-story home at the base of Sinking Creek Mountain, where they raised their families. George, a Confederate veteran, wanted a better life for his children and encouraged their education. Caldwell most likely attended one of the many small schools located near the family farm, or was taught by an instructor at home. He may have become aware of the new agricultural and mechanical school in Blacksburg through the many newspaper advertisements placed by the school's founding president, Charles L.C. Minor. == The Caldwell March == Jefferson National Forest At the age of 16, Caldwell and his older brother, Milton M. \\"Mic\\" (age 18) made arrangements to attend Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (V.A.M.C.) in 1872. The brothers hiked from Sinking Creek, Craig County to Blacksburg, Va., located 28 miles southwest of the Caldwell farm on the far side of Gap Mountain. The Caldwell brothers' familiarity with foot trails may have assisted them in shortening the hike considerably. Addison enrolled as the school's first student on October 1, 1872 at the Preston and Olin Building to officially mark the beginning of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College. Mic enrolled several hours after Addison. School president, Charles Minor and the faculty, including James Henry Lane, Charles Martin, Gray Carroll, and Shepherd were on hand to welcome the school's first students. Caldwell, had received a scholarship from his county's school superintendent, The scholarship covered tuition ($30), college fees ($10), and barracks fee ($5/month). In a letter to General Joseph R. Anderson, a member of the school's Board of Visitors, President Minor wrote: \\"We have now thirty students matriculated, ... our beginning is to be smaller than had been expected.\\" Minor also described the new students as \\"plain lads for the most part\\" and largely under-prepared, forcing the faculty to review high school, and even grammar school material. The total enrollment increased to 132 students by the end of the first school year. == College years == Caldwell attended V.A.M.C. from 1872–1876, taking an extra year to complete the three-year program in agriculture. His brother, Mic was enrolled in 1872, 73, 76, and 1877. Their younger brother, Frank B., enrolled from 1874-1877. Neither Frank, nor Mic graduated. All students lived a military lifestyle and were members of what is now known as the Corps of Cadets. In 1872, cadets were assigned to either A or B company and wore standard uniforms of gray pants jackets and hats with black trim. General James Henry Lane, a former Confederate General, was the school's first Commandant of Cadets. Caldwell attained the rank of second sergeant of VAMC's Company B in his final year. According to Caldwell's 1875 report card, he excelled in written composition, military tactics, and farm work. He was above average in natural history, French, chemistry, and composition/rhetoric and \\"tolerable\\" or worse in mathematics and bookkeeping. His other courses during his four years at VAMC most likely included: English grammar, geography with map drawing, descriptive astronomy, penmanship, free-hand drawing, lectures on physiology and hygiene, habits and manners, and lectures on agricultural and mechanical arts. In 1872, Caldwell joined the Maury Literary society, which became two separate societies in 1873: the Lee Literary Society and the Maury Literary Society. Both groups focused on writing, public speaking and debate and together they founded the school's first publication, The Gray Jacket in 1875. William Addison Caldwell graduated with V.A.M.C.'s second class on August 9, 1876. Gen. J. H. Williams of Winchester delivered the annual commencement address. The graduating class held an alumni meeting and elected Caldwell as secretary of the alumni association of the class of 1876 . == Post Graduation == Caldwell became a school teacher in Craig County shortly after graduating. By 1887, he was an office clerk at Norfolk and Western Railway in Roanoke, Virginia, where he was described as a \\"well-known and popular employee\\". In 1898, Caldwell moved to Wilmington, North Carolina and worked as a salesman for several large wholesale firms on the wharf, including the Stove Company, Mr. W.B. Cooper, Messrs. Blair & Haly, and the C.C. Covington Company. In Caldwell's absence, his parents, brother, Mic, and sisters, Grace and Nell sold the farm in Sinking Creek and moved to Radford, VA. He visited them in the summer months. == Health issues and death == Sometime before 1910, Caldwell's health declined, and he had surgery for a brain tumor. He stayed at the family home in Radford to recover. In the spring of 1910, he returned to Wilmington, N. C. on his doctor's recommendation that salt air would be good for him. He became a clerk at the Tangmoore Hotel in Wrightsville Beach on June 1, 1910. In a letter to his niece, Caldwell wrote that it was \\"a fine place\\" but he would prefer to be in Radford and couldn't tell if the salt air was helpful or not. On June 19, Caldwell fainted and fell, suffering a head injury. He died on June 29, 1910 in a hospital in Wilmington and was buried in the Caldwell family cemetery in Radford On July 1, 1910. == Legacy == William Addison Caldwell is an icon for the university. His epic hike to enroll as the school's very first student is commemorated in many ways: * _The 'Caldwell March'_ \\\\- A memorial hike, named after Caldwell. Each year, freshman cadets re-enact the hike made by Caldwell in two parts: half the distance in the fall semester and the second half in spring. The Spring march concludes on campus in the Upper Quad, where the Corps band, the Highty-Tighties play and Skipper, the cadet's cannon is sounded. * _The Addison Caldwell Statue_ \\\\- A life-size statue of Caldwell, sculpted by Lawrence Bechtel, titled \\"Walking Toward the Light\\". The statue was unveiled on campus on October 20, 2006 and depicts Caldwell during his 26-mile hike from his home in Sinking Creek, VA. The statue was originally located near Rasche Hall on the Upper Quad of campus. Upon the completion of two new cadet dorms in 2017, the statue was relocated to a more prominent location along steps between the Upper Quad an Alumni Mall. A plaque, mounted with the statue reads: \\"Craig County farm boy Add Caldwell walked 26 miles to enroll here in 1872 as the first student.The popular cadet majored in agriculture and worked as a teacher, clerk, and salesman before his death in 1910.

Burke Johnston Student Center on the campus of Virginia Tech. * _The Virginia Tech Library System_ \\\\- The library's e-catalog is known as 'Addison'. * _Caldwell's bible_ \\\\- Caldwell's personal bible was donated to Virginia Tech by his nephew, and namesake in 1989. * _National Forest campsite: \\"Caldwell Fields\\"_ \\\\- A campground in Jefferson National Forest with 3 sections named after the Caldwell brothers: Addison, Milton (Mic), and George. The Caldwell March starts and ends near the park. * Virginia Historical marker- In 1997, a state historical marker honoring Add was placed near the Caldwell Farm, near the towns of New Castle and Simmonsville, in Craig County at routes 42 and 625 at coordinates: 37° 25.565′ N, 80° 15.176′ W. The marker reads: \\"KH3 - WILLIAM ADDISON \\"ADD\\" CALDWELL - VIRGINIA TECH'S FIRST STUDENT. Three miles north of here stands the childhood home of William Addison “Add” Caldwell. He walked about 28-miles to Blacksburg on 1 October 1872 and became the first student to register at Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, now Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Graduating in 1876, Caldwell was elected secretary of his class alumni association. He worked as a teacher, clerk and salesman before his death on 29 June 1910. He is buried in Radford, Virginia.\\" ==References External links == * Video: Virginia Tech: Caldwell March * Video: Virginia Tech: Caldwell March 2013 Category:Virginia Tech alumni Category:1856 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Education in Virginia Category:Virginia Tech Category:People from Craig County, Virginia Category:People from Wilmington, North Carolina ","title":"Addison Caldwell"},{"id":"56776170","text":"Ester Geislerová (born 5 March 1984) is a Czech actress and former model. ==Biography== Geislerová was born in Prague.

Tribologists study tribological systems in detail, and devise tribological test procedures. == Definition == According to ASTM G40-17, a tribosystem is \\"any system that contains one or more triboelements, including all mechanical, chemical, and environmental factors relevant to tribological behavior.\\" Here, triboelement refers to \\"one of two or more solid bodies that comprise a sliding, rolling, or abrasive contact, or a body subjected to impingement or cavitation.\\" More simply speaking, a tribosystem is a tribological system that consists of at least two contacting bodies, including the environment in which the interaction takes place. The complete description of a tribosystem includes all relevant factors that govern the tribological behavior of the system. Thus, depending on the aim of the tribological analysis, the tribosystem boundary is flexible and can be drawn more or less widely. == Describing Tribosystems == The description of tribosystems is based on a detailed assessment of relevant system inputs, outputs and losses, as well as an overall description of the system structure. The following table gives an overview. {  +Complete Description of a Tribosystem !Inputs !Outputs !Losses !System Structure -  * load * velocity * temperature * duration * disturbances * ...  * motion (rotational, linear, ...) * torque * force * changes in mechanical energy * ...  * friction * wear * vibrations * ...  * triboelements (incl. properties) * system kinematics * interactions of triboelements } == Relevance == The complete description of a tribosystem is the first step when devising a tribological test procedure. Since tribological tests are often carried out on simplified model systems using standardized tribometers, a complete description of the tribosystem allows for tribological testing across different scales. For example, if the tribological analysis aims to investigate a specific gear contact in a complex gearbox, exact knowledge of tribological inputs allows tribologists to devise a simplified test setup involving two gears only. Conversely, if the analysis aims to develop a new lubricant formulation for gearbox applications, a rough description of the gearbox-tribosystem allows to reduce testing to relevant system inputs. Thus, detailed knowledge of the tribosystem can significantly reduce the development effort for machines and lubricants. == References == Category:Tribology ","title":"Tribosystem"},{"id":"56776231","text":"The March 6–8, 2018 nor'easter was a powerful nor'easter that wreaked havoc on the Northeastern United States just days after another intense nor'easter struck the Mid-Atlantic, hampering recovery efforts from that storm. Forming on March 2 and reaching the Outer Banks late on March 6, as the end phase of a long-tracked winter storm across the country, it rapidly deepened off the Mid- Atlantic coast on March 7 and brought up to of heavy snow, whiteout conditions, and even coastal flooding (though nowhere near the levels seen in the prior nor'easter) to those in the impact zone from the storm, many of whom were still without power from the previous storm less than a week prior. The storm caused up to 1 million people to lose power, and at least two people were confirmed dead due to the storm by March 7. Hundreds of flights were cancelled across the region, and many schools closed due to the nor'easter, although some opted to remain open, such as those in New York City, causing controversy. Many freeways were also closed in the regions, and several states were put under state of emergencies. ==Meteorological history== While the previous nor'easter hammered the Northeastern U.S. on March 2–3, another winter storm had begun developing in the western part of the country, dumping very heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This storm moved into the Upper Midwest over the next few days and became an intense snowstorm for the affected areas. By early on March 6, the system had reached the Great Lakes, with the surface low beginning to weaken. As it did so, energy began to be transferred over to a new area of low pressure that was forming near the Outer Banks late that day. As the new low began to rapidly intensify, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) began issuing storm summaries on the intensifying low off the coast of New Jersey early on March 7. A sharp transition of heavy snow to rain was observed near the Jersey Shore, due to warm air aloft pushing slightly inland, with the cold air residing just inland. Thundersnow and snowfall rates of up to an hour were reported in areas around the New York metropolitan area, signaling the rapid intensification of the storm. Late in the afternoon, an eye-like feature was spotted near the center of the storm. The pressure bottomed out at around the same time. After peaking, the system began to gradually weaken as it continued moving northeastwards towards the Canadian Maritimes late on March 7–8, while heavy snowfall fell around the areas near Boston, Massachusetts. Turning northwestward slightly, moderate snowfall continued to occur over the coastal and interior sections of New England. The low continued to spin down throughout the day, with snow tapering off in much of the region except for the northern parts of New York and far northern New England. By 15:00 UTC the next day, the system had weakened to the point where the WPC terminated storm summaries on the winter storm. It dissipated shortly afterwards. ==Preparations and impactMid-Atlantic states=== Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. on the night of March 6. Amtrak operated a modified schedule along the Northeast Corridor on March 7 due to the storm. About 2,500 flights were cancelled and several schools were closed in the Northeast United States on March 7 because of the upcoming storm. North Carolina The storm caused coastal flooding along the Outer Banks, with North Carolina Highway 12 closed between Rodanthe and the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge. Maryland and Delaware Several schools in Maryland were closed due to snow. The storm caused flooding along some streets in Annapolis. Flooding from high tides was also seen in some communities along the Chesapeake Bay including Cambridge, Crisfield, and Deal Island. In Delaware, the Delaware Memorial Bridge was temporarily closed due to several tractor-trailers being disabled. It was re-opened a few hours later after the vehicles were removed. The Delaware General Assembly cancelled its session for March 7 while the University of Delaware closed at noon on March 7. Pennsylvania Snow from the nor'easter in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf declared a state of emergency for several counties in the eastern part of the state. A snow emergency went into effect for the city of Philadelphia on the morning of March 7. Several municipalities in the Philadelphia area declared snow emergencies and many schools and government offices were closed on March 7. Many attractions in the Philadelphia area either closed early or were closed for the entire day on March 7. SEPTA modified their service plan for March 7 due to the snow, with Regional Rail trains running on a modified Saturday schedule and Broad Street Line and Market-Frankford Line trains running during the overnight hours. In addition, several SEPTA bus routes were placed on detours in advance of the storm. On the afternoon of March 7, SEPTA suspended most of their bus services due to the snow. At the Philadelphia International Airport, a ground stop was issued in place. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation implemented speed restrictions of on several freeways in the southeastern part of the state while the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission reduced the speed limit to on portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension (Interstate 476) in the Philadelphia area. High-profile vehicles such as empty trucks, motorcycles, and recreational vehicles were banned along several Interstate Highways in eastern Pennsylvania due to the storm. New Jersey Near whiteout conditions on the New Jersey Turnpike in East Windsor Township, New Jersey. In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and state offices were closed on March 7. New Jersey Transit suspended bus service statewide on the afternoon of March 7, with trains running an abbreviated schedule. More than 322,000 customers in the state were without power, including people who had lost power from a prior storm on March 2. Newark Liberty International Airport was closed briefly during the afternoon of March 7, with limited service soon resuming. The storm forced the closure of the Burlington-Bristol Bridge over the Delaware River. Thundersnow was seen in the state, with lightning striking a teacher in Manchester Township, who suffered injuries and was in stable condition. Snowmobiles had to be sent out to rescue travelers on Interstate 280 and Interstate 78 who had become stuck in the snow during the storm, some who had been trapped for over five hours. About 500 vehicles were reported to have gotten stuck during the incident. New York In New York City, the exceptionally heavy snow made travel difficult, with ferry service suspended. Central Park reported 3.2 inches, while JFK International Airport reported only 2.8 inches, which was much less than many of the forecasts, which suggested that 1–2 feet of snow would fall. However, there was a very sharp gradient in snow totals, with Franklin Lakes, NJ, just under 20 miles away from Central Park, reporting a total of 24.8 inches. In North White Plains, 10 people were taken to the hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running inside their home. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a travel ban for tractor-trailers along the New York State Thruway between New York City and Syracuse. Classes were cancelled until March 9 at Binghamton University due to the storm. Many schools in the Lower Hudson Valley closed for the fifth time in a row, eliminating most of the districts’ spring breaks (from Friday, March 2 to Thursday, March 8). Putnam County issued a State Of Emergency, closing all school districts in the county on Thursday, March 8. The Harvard Sailing Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts partially sinking into the Charles River during the nor'easter. ===New England=== Connecticut In Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy sent nonessential state employees home early on March 7 ahead of the anticipated heavy snow. At the height of the storm, over 160,000 residents were without electricity. New Fairfield had the greatest accumulation in the state with of snow. Massachusetts In Boston, several shuttle bus routes were cancelled for the rest of the week due to the storm. Crews worked to secure a seawall in Duxbury that was damaged by a prior storm on March 2. After the storm had passed, on March 8, a commuter train slid off the tracks in Wilmington after it struck a tree that was lodged into the tracks. No one was injured in the incident. The Harvard Sailing Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts partially sank into the Charles River during the nor'easter. The building was compromised due to a failure of the flotation device used to keep the structure afloat. ==See also== *March 2013 nor'easter *March 2014 nor'easter *February 2017 North American blizzard *March 1–3, 2018 nor'easter – the previous nor'easter that hit the area just a few days prior ==References * Category:March 2018 events in the United States Category:2017–18 North American winter Category:2018 natural disasters in the United States Category:Nor'easters ","title":"March 6–8, 2018 nor'easter"},{"id":"56776237","text":"The 1987 World Table Tennis Championships – Men's Doubles was the 39th edition of the men's doubles championship.

In 1813, Bushnell's father Alexander, a ship carpenter, moved his family from New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ==Career== In 1839, Daniel Bushnell entered the coal business in Pennsylvania, shipping coal from remote areas up the Monongahela River to population centers downstream. Previously, traders had thought that the cost in coal of using a steamboat to bring coal to ports down the Ohio river would exceed the amount of coal that a steamboat could deliver. In June 1845, however, Bushnell showed that towing coal down the Ohio was actually quite profitable, delivering 2,000 bushels of coal to Cincinnati on his tugboat, the \\"Walter Forward.\\" In 1851 Bushnell built another towboat, the \\"Black Diamond,\\" which was used to ship even more coal from the Pennsylvania mines to ports along the region's rivers. Bushnell hired the Captain J.J Vandergrift to captain his steamboats, and soon the two men were shipping coal as far as New Orleans. Bushnell's innovation brought about a boom in the Pennsylvania coal business, spurring growth in Pittsburgh and the surrounding towns. Bushnell also owned and operated a number of coal mines of his own, including the Hodgson Mine (opened 1843) and the Bushnell mine (opened 1840), both outside of Pittsburgh. In 1861 Bushnell left the coal business and began trading oil along the Allegheny River. Working with his sons Joseph, Thomas, John and Robert, as well as his old colleague Captain Vandergrift, Bushnell and his partners made a fortune by buying oil at the Venango oil wells and shipping it down the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh. The Bushnell family's oil operations were soon bought out by John D. Rockefeller's growing oil company in exchange for shares in Rockefeller's firm. As a result, Bushnell became one of the 37 original Standard Oil shareholders, owning 97 shares in 1878 (compared to Rockefeller's nearly 9,000). Daniel Bushnell died in Pittsburgh on July 12, 1891, leaving his large fortune to his seven surviving children. Daniel Bushnell's business partner, Captain Jacob Jay Vandergrift (1827–1899) ==Personal life== Daniel Bushnell first married Eleanor Gray (1811–1854), with whom he had 14 children. His second wife was Elizabeth Hill, with whom Bushnell had three more children. One of Bushnell's daughters, Sarah Wells Bushnell, married another Standard Oil shareholder, William Gray Warden. Sarah and William Warden's daughter Mary Warden Harkness (1864–1916) was a philanthropist and the wife of Standard Oil heir Charles W. Harkness. Another one of Bushnell's granddaughters, Eleanor Bushnell Davis, married the engineer Morris Llewellyn Cooke. American intelligence officer Peter Ashmun Ames and novelist Joseph Bushnell Ames were Daniel's great-grandsons through his son Joseph. Daniel Bushnell's brother was the Reverend Wells Bushnell (1799–1863), a prominent Presbyterian minister. == References == Category:1808 births Category:1891 deaths Category:American businesspeople in the oil industry Category:Businesspeople from Pittsburgh ","title":"Daniel Bushnell"},{"id":"56776302","text":"Kaye Wellings is an active Sexual and Reproductive Health educator and has worked within this field of study for over 20 years.

It started in the UK in the early 1600s during the reign of King James I. Gamblers can stake money on the final placement of the horses taking part in a race. Gambling on horses is, however, prohibited at some racetracks. For example, because of a law passed in 1951, betting is illegal in Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in Camden, South Carolina. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer parimutuel betting where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction has been made from the pool. Parimutuel betting also provides purse money to participants and a considerable amount of tax revenue, with over $100 billion being wagered annually in 53 countries. In some countries – notably the UK, Ireland, and Australia – an alternative and more popular facility is provided by bookmakers who effectively make a market in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK). ==Types of bets== Gamblers awaiting the result of a horse race at the Hippodrome de Vincennes in Paris In North American racing, the three most common ways to bet money are to win, to place, and to show. A bet to win, sometimes called a \\"straight\\" bet, means staking money on the horse, and if it comes in first place, the bet is a winner. In a bet to place, you are betting on your horse to finish either first or second. A bet to show wins if the horse finishes first, second or third. Since it is much easier to select a horse to finish first, second, or third than it is to select a horse just for first, the show payoffs will be much lower on average than win payoffs. If there are a small number of horses in the race, show or place bets may not be offered (or if bets have already been made, they are cancelled and the wagered amounts refunded). The Epsom Derby betting post, c. 1835 In Europe, Australia, and Asia, betting to place is different since the number of \\"payout places\\" varies depending on the size of the field that takes part in the race. For example, in a race with seven or less runners in the UK, only the first two finishers would be considered winning bets with most bookmakers. Three places are paid for eight or more runners, whilst a handicap race with 16 runners or more will see the first four places being classed as \\"placed\\". (A show bet in the North American sense does not exist in these locations.) The term each-way (E/W) bet is used everywhere but North America, and has a different meaning depending on the location. An each-way bet sees the total bet being split in two, with half being placed on the win, and half on the place. Bettors receive a payout if the horse either wins, and/or is placed based on the place criteria as stated above. The full odds are paid if the horse wins, (plus the place portion), with a quarter or a fifth of the odds (depending on the race- type and the number of runners) if only the place section of the bet is successful. In the UK some bookmakers will pay for the first five (some independent firms have even paid the first six) for a place on the Grand National. This additional concession is offered because of the large number of runners in the race (maximum 40). Occasionally other handicap races with large fields (numbers of runners) receive the same treatment from various bookmakers, especially if they are sponsoring the race. The rough equivalent of the each-way in North America is the across the board (win/place/show) or win/place bet, where equal bets on a horse are made to win, place, and show (or just win and place). Each portion is treated by the totalizator as a separate bet, so an across-the-board bet is merely a convenience for bettors and parimutuel clerks. For instance, if a $2 across-the-board bet (total outlay of $6) were staked on a horse which finished second, paying $4.20 to place and $3.00 to show, the bettor would receive $7.20 on what is essentially a $6 wager. In addition to straight wagers, \\"exotic\\" wagers offer bettors an opportunity to incorporate the placement of different horses in one or multiple races. The two broad types of exotic wagers are horizontal and vertical. Horizontal exotic wagers are bets on multiple horses in one particular race, while vertical exotic wagers involve predicting results across multiple races. Both have specific options for which bets are available and are detailed below. In the most basic horizontal wager, an exacta, the bettor selects the first and second place horses in the exact order. Picking the first three finishers in exact order is called a trifecta and a superfecta refers to the specific finishing order of the top four horses. Boxing is a tactic that increases the odds of winning an exotic wager by removing the need to choose the exact order. A quinella, which boxes an exacta (allowing the first two finishers to come in any order and still win), is the basic box, but boxing can be applied to the trifecta and superfecta as well. A wheel is a bet on a single horse is to finish in a specific position, with multiple horses finishing ahead and/or behind it. In a sense, a win bet can be thought of as a specific type of wheel bet. Vertical bets are spread over different races. A daily double is an exotic wager placed on the winner of two consecutive races. Picking the winner of three, four, five or six straight races is referred to as a pick-3, pick-4, pick-5 and pick-6 respectively. ==Betting exchanges== In addition to traditional betting with a bookmaker, punters (bettors) are able to both back and lay money on an online betting exchange. Punters who lay the odds are in effect acting as a bookmaker. The odds of a horse are set by the market conditions of the betting exchange which is dictated to by the activity of the members. ===United States=== In the United States, the states with the largest pools are California, New York, Kentucky, Florida, Maryland and Illinois in no particular order. Betting on horse racing in the United States varies from state to state. By the late 19th century over 300 tracks were in operation in the country but those opposed to gambling caused the banning of bookmakers and horse racing at the beginning of the next century. In 1908 pari-mutuel (tote) betting was introduced, helping the industry to prosper and that has continued to be the case to the present day. Pari-mutuel betting is currently legal in 32 US states. Due to new legislation horse race betting in the US could change significantly in the near future. The legal market handle on horse racing in the United States in 2018 was $11.26 billion while experts predict the illegal sports betting market could be anywhere from $80 billion to $150 billion annually. Kentucky Derby Run on the first Saturday in May the most famous horse race in the United States, the Kentucky Derby, takes place at Churchill Downs and is known as ‘The Run For The Roses.’ The one mile two furlong contest dates back to 1875. $149.9 million was wagered on the race in 2019, beating the previous record amount of $139.2 set 12 months earlier. $24.6 million of that total was gambled online. ===Hong Kong=== Hong Kong generates the largest horse racing revenue in the world and is home to some of the largest horse betting circles including the Hong Kong Jockey Club founded in 1884. In 2009, Hong Kong generated an average US$12.7 million in gambling turnover per race 6 times larger than its closest rival France at US$2 million while the United States only generated $250,000. Betting on horse racing is ingrained in local culture and is seen as an investment. During the 2014-2015 racing season the Hong Kong Jockey Club attracted about HK$138.8 million (US$17.86 million) per race more that any other track in the world. The revenue the club generate from various wagers makes it the largest taxpayer for the government. Hong Kong Jockey Club broke its own record during the 2016-2017 season with a turnover of HK$216.5 billion and paid the government HK$21.7 billion in duty and profits tax, an all-time high. ===Australia=== A government survey in 2015 found that nearly one million Australians (5.6% of Australian adults) gambled on dog or horse racing in Australia. Most were men aged between 30 and 64 who had a typical yearly expenditure of $1,300 on race betting. Nationally, typical annual race-betting expenditure amounted to roughly $1.27 billion. Horse race betting in New South Wales (NSW) is conducted by bookmakers (at race meetings and via telephone) and Tabcorp (tote betting at racecourses and through various retail outlets including the internet). In 2014 it was estimated that $300 million alone was bet on Australia’s most famous race - the Melbourne Cup. ===United Kingdom=== Betting on horse racing in the UK is wide and varied. Unlike most other countries where the pari-mutuel system is in operation the UK’s version - the Tote - accounts for only a small percentage (in the region of 5%) of the total betting turnover. Between April 2017 and March 2018 off-course horse racing betting turnover in Great Britain amounted to £4.3 billion. The majority of the money wagered on horse racing in the UK is with bookmakers, either in betting shops or online. In 2018 there were 8.5 thousand betting shops in Great Britain. This figure is expected to decrease significantly in 2019 when government restrictions on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBT’s) comes into force. ==See also== * Gambling * Parimutuel gambling * Mathematics of bookmaking * Zeljko Ranogajec * Bill Benter * Alan Woods (gambler) ==References== Category:Wagering Category:Horse racing Category:Sports betting ","title":"Betting on horse racing"},{"id":"56776310","text":"Lauren Sager Weinstein is the Chief Data Officer at Transport for London.

Consisting of two similar buildings separated by a short bridge and a moat, each team must fight their way into the opposing team's building and capture their flag/intelligence from an underground base concealed beneath. A launch map for Team Fortress 2, 2Fort was critically praised as an iconic map for the series and one of the best first-person shooter maps of all time. == Level design == 2Fort is a symmetrical map, with each team's intelligence located in an underground fortress beneath the two buildings. The design allows players to \\"come together and battle it out along the center bridge\\". The map is designed so that each class can take a different tactical approach, such as Heavies and Medics fighting along the bridge while Spies can attempt to sneak through the sewers. The layout of the map remained largely untouched between Team Fortress and its sequel. == Development == In 2009, the source code of 2Fort, among other maps, was released by Valve to allow for easier modding. For the 2015 Invasion Update, the community-created \\"2Fort Invasion\\" map was added to the game, remodeling the map to look like it was being invaded by aliens. == Reception == Alex Walker of Kotaku called 2Fort one of the best first-person shooter multiplayer maps of all time, calling it an \\"absolute classic\\", and citing its design which allows every class to \\"contribute in some meaningful way\\". Shacknews called the map memorable due to the numerous servers hosted unending 2Fort games, which \\"became TF2's greatest charm\\", allowing teams to socialize with each other, and giving people \\"a magical place to unwind and just relax\\", a casual place to practice with the team's classes rather than worrying about capturing the intelligence. PCGamesN called 2Fort a \\"fan favorite\\" map that \\"was awful if you wanted rounds that lasted under an hour\\", its design elements contributing to stalemates that made it a good place to socialize, and criticizing Overwatch for a lack of \\"low energy\\" social spaces by comparison. Nick Breckon of Shacknews agreed that the map's design resulted in \\"long, drawn-out stalemates\\", due to the location of the intelligence point beneath the enemy's spawn room. Robo Panda Z of Destructoid said that \\"nothing epitomizes the multiplayer experience for me more than this map\\", calling 2Fort a \\"Capture the flag grind-fest\\" and an \\"eternal stalemate broken by the closest of teamwork\\", while praising the addition of a roof to the bridge in the Team Fortress 2 version.

On 22 December 1768, he was granted a coat of arms for “having been on the 7th day of January 1763 taken by a French Squadron cruising off Bengal in the East Indies and by desperate attempt overcoming the crew of the vessel whereon he was prisoner, by which success he regained his liberty and got safe to Calcutta where his critical intelligence of the enemy proved of essential service to the Commerce which the Factory testified by public thanks. After which engaging as a volunteer he served with reputation having likewise had the happiness to succeed in establishing an important fir trade for masts in the interior parts of Bengal with the Mountain Rajas”.College of Arms record Ms Grants 11/350. ==BiographyEarly life=== William Mirtle was born 24 December 1739 to Thomas Mirtle, brewer in Edinburgh, and his wife Jean Rannie. Jean was the niece of Sir David Rannie (1 July 1716 - 17 November 1764), who made a fortune with the East India Company, later returning to Scotland and purchasing Melville Castle. By 1758, William had followed in his great-uncle's footsteps, and enlisted with the East India Company, serving as a mate on the snow Speedwell. ===A French fleet at Balasore === In 1763 the French privateers Vengeur, Fidèle, and Condé, were cruising in Balasore Roads and captured some English ships, which caused a great panic in Calcutta. At a consultation held at Fort William on 12 January 1763, Peter Amyatt Esq., President and Council of Fort William, informed the Agent Board … “that the Chowky Boat arrived at Town last night at 12 o’clock with William Mirtle on Board, late Mate of the “Speedwell” Snow (under) Captain Ramsay, who brings the following intelligence: Namely, that they were taken on the 7th Instant in 25 fathoms of water by a French Squadron consisting of two Ships & Frigate which is cruising in Balasore & has made besides the following Prizes Vizt. The “Walpole”, bound to Madras, the “Grampus” Pilot Sloop, Mr. Savage Pilot, & a Sloop from Chittagong supposed to be the “Clive”. That he (Mirtle) on the morning of the 9th repossessed himself of the “Speedwell” & was pushing in for the River, but finding he was in danger of being again taken by the French Frigate he took to his Boat with ten Lascars and made his escape.” In the debate that followed it was decided that several ships should remain at Kedgeree, but that Pilots should be sent aboard them with instructions to sail up the Hooghly River if the enemy attacked, and that twenty sepoys should be detailed to each ship as a further safeguard. It was also decided to send a sloop to cruise off Palmyras Point to warn inbound ships, and that another sloop (well armed and manned) should watch the motions of the French squadron and annoy any boats or sloops they may send into the river. The only other event of importance during the French squadron’s visit to Balasore was a fight with the East Indiaman Winchelsea, which escaped after an engagement lasting for two hours. ===Fir timber merchant and explorer=== By 1766, William had become a timber collector in the Purnia district, and spent time exploring the interior of India towards the Nepalese border, gaining extensive knowledge of the Hill States of India and of the fir trade there. right ===Death and afterward=== In 1769, William Mirtle was deputed to the Morang country to obtain wood for masts, tar, pitch, and turpentine, but he died before completing his mission. On his death, the task was entrusted to Francis Peacock and James Christie. ===Hillslap Tower and estate=== The Hillslap (or Hillslope) estate, which was originally known as Calfhill, lies to the northeast of Galashiels, Scotland. This estate remained in the possession of the Cairncross family from 1569 to 1759, when, owing to the death of the sixth and last laird, Hugh Cairncross, without issue, it passed into the hands of descendants of females of the house. The legal fight for succession took until 1769, and included William Mirtle as one of the claimants. His father, Thomas Mirtle, provided proofs of relation to Alison Cairncross, a daughter of Nicol Cairncross, the second, of Hillslop. These proofs consisted of charges granted by Thomas Martle, the great- grandfather of William Mirtle, to the Cairncross family acknowledging receipt of tocher paid to Thomas Martle with respect to his marriage to Alison Cairncross. On 9 March 1769, the House of Lords ruled in favour of \\"William Myrtle, son of the deceased Thomas Myrtle, brewer in Edinburgh\\" and his other claimants, William Heatly, Thomas Mill, and Alexander Home. William was in India at the time, and died shortly after his legal victory. The estate soon became the property of Mr. William Patterson, a wealthy tanner in Galashiels. right ==Honours, decorations, awards, and distinctions== A grant of Arms and Crest to \\"William Mirtle of Calcutta in the Kingdom of Bengal, Gentleman, only son of Thomas Mirtle of the City of Edinburgh, deceased, by Jane his wife, daughter of David Rannie of the same city and grandson of William Mirtle\\", was granted on 22 December 1768 as follows: Per fess wavy Gules and Argent in Chief a Lion passant guardant Erminois and in Base on a Mount Vert a Fir-tree proper.

Ross is an African American academic, feminist, and activist who advocates for reproductive justice, especially among women of color. As an activist, Ross has written on reproductive justice activism and the history of African American women. Ross was one of the first women of color who won the lawsuit against A.H. Robbins Company for their defective intrauterine product, Dalkon Shield. == Early life and education == Ross was born in Temple, Texas on August 16, 1953, the sixth of eight children in a blended family. Her father, who immigrated from Jamaica, was an Army weapons specialist and drill sergeant. He retired from the military in 1963, worked for the Post Office, and held odd jobs to support his family Ross' mother worked as a domestic worker and owned a music store, though worked as a housewife while Ross was growing up. From 2017-2018, Ross was a visiting Associate Professor in the Women’s Studies department at Hampshire College, teaching the course “White Supremacy in the Age of Trump” for the current academic year. For her primary education, Ross attended integrated schools: Army schools through second grade, then public schools. She was double-promoted in elementary grades and was an honors student in high school. She went to Army school through second grade and transferred to public schools afterwards. Ross' grades were high and she received honors during her school years. In 1964, at age 11, Ross became a survivor of sexual assault, where she was beaten and raped by a stranger. In 1968, at the age of 15, Ross was raped by her distant cousin, became pregnant, and gave birth to her son, Howard. Ross lost her scholarship from Radcliffe College when she decided to keep her son instead of sending him away for adoption. In 1970, Ross attended Howard University for her tertiary education. During her undergraduate career there, she became actively involved in black nationalist politics, civil rights movements such as black women feminism ideologies and racial issues, and tenant organizing. Ross joined a Marxist- Leninist discussion group called the D.C. Study Group, and the South Africa Support Project. In 1976, at age 23, Ross experienced sterilization abuse when she was sterilized with Dalkon Shield. The Daikon Sheild was a type of intrauterine device that was marketed despite found to be defective. The device caused major negative health threats to its users, especially inflicting harm on African American and poor communities. Ross was among the first women of color to win the suit case against the manufacturer of Dalkon Shield, A.H. Robins. This incident has influenced Ross tremendously. Because of this experience, she found her passion advocating for reproductive justice and racial politics. In November 1980, the murder of her close friend and political ally, Yulanda Ward, became the turning point in Ross' life as an activist. Ross has referred to this murder as a political assassination. In 2007, Ross completed her bachelor's degree at Agnes Scott College. Under the direction of professor Elizabeth Hackett, Ross wrote Just Choices: Women of Color, Reproductive Health and Human Rights, her capstone Women's Studies independent study project at Agnes Scott. She is currently pursuing her PhD in Women's Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2018, she was hired by Arizona State University to teach a 400-level course on Reproductive Justice, a topic on which she has co-authored three books. == Feminism and activism == In 1977, Ross and a group of Black and minority activists coined the term \\"women of color\\" at the National Women's Conference as a unifying term to address political and social issues. Driven by her personal experience as a survivor of sexual assault, in 1979, Ross became the third Executive Director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, the first rape crisis center that was primarily run by and geared toward providing resources for women of color. In August 1980, Ross, accompanied by others from the DC Rape Crisis Center, organized the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence in Washington, DC. This was the first conference that brought together women from different racial backgrounds, unifying the participants towards achieving the goal of cultivating a new, holistic network for people of color, both women and men, to advocate for anti-violence activism. In 1985, the National Organization for Women (NOW) hired Ross to be the director of the Women of Color Programs to both improve participation by women of color in NOW, create coalitions with organizations focused on issues affecting women of color, and to respond to criticism by women of color who felt mainstream feminist organizations were ignoring issues of race and class. Ross organized women of color delegations for the pro-choice marches NOW sponsored in 1986 and 1989, and organized the first national conference on Women of Color and Reproductive Rights in 1987. In response to the Supreme Court's Webster decision in 1989, Ross co-coordinated production of the pathbreaking statement \\"We Remember: African American Women Are For Reproductive Freedom.\\" As Program Director (1989–90) for the National Black Women's Health Project (now known as the Black Women's Health Imperative), she coordinated the first national conference of African American women for reproductive rights. From 1980 to 1988, she was a member of the D.C. Commission on Women. From 1991 to 1995, Ross was National Program Research Director for the Center for Democratic Renewal (formerly the National Anti-Klan Network), where she directed projects on right-wing organizations in South Africa, Klan and neo-Nazi involvement in anti-abortion violence, and human rights education in the U.S. In 1996 she created the National Center for Human Rights Education, a training and resource center for grassroots activists aimed at applying a human rights analysis to injustices in the U.S. Active internationally, Ross is a founding member of the International Council of African Women and of the Network of East-West Women. She has been a regular participant in International Women and Health Meetings and helped organize the delegation of 1100 African American women to the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1984. She attended United Nations Women's Conferences in Copenhagen, Nairobi, and Beijing. In 1997, with Luz Rodriguez and 14 others, Ross co- founded SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective which aims to build an effective network between individuals in advocating improvements within institutional policies that impact the reproductive lives of marginalized communities. Ross served as the National Coordinator for the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective from 2005 until 2012. Ross was one of the African American women who first coined the term \\"reproductive justice,\\" with the aim to frame the pursuit of reproductive justice using the social justice framework. In 2002, Ross was one of the interviewees featured in the Global Feminism Project archive, which is a project organized under the University of Michigan, compiling interviews of feminist icons from many different countries. Ross acted as National Co- Director for women of color of Washington, D.C.'s March for Women's Lives on April 25, 2004. She was the Founder and Executive Director of Atlanta, Georgia's National Center for Human Rights Education (NCHRE) from 1996–2004. == Writing and teaching == Ross has published books on reproductive justice, as well as many articles on Black women and abortion. In 2004, Ross co- authored Undivided Rights: Women of Color Organizing for Reproductive Justice, a book that uncovers the unrevealed history of the activism of women of color in organizing for reproductive justice. Ross contributed her insights in a chapter entitled \\"The Color of Choice\\" in Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology, which was published in 2016. Currently, Ross is working on her soon-to-be published book entitled Black Abortion that will focus on reproductive rights issues. Ross served as a visiting Associate Professor in the Women’s Studies department at Hampshire College. She taught a course “White Supremacy in the age of Trump” for the academic year 2017-2018. Ross is a consultant for Smith College, where she is expanding the Sophia Smith Collection, which includes her personal archives. She has served as a visiting professor at Smith and has organized two community-wide conferences on Calling In the Calling Out Culture. She is currently a Visiting Clinical Professor at Arizona State University in the School of Social Transformation teaching a 400-level course on Reproductive Justice. Alongside Rickie Solinger, Ross co- authored Reproductive Justice: An Introduction, which details the field of reproductive justice, particularly in regards to experiences involving women of color and through a human rights analytical lens. Her most recent book, Radical Reproductive Justice was published by Feminist Press in 2017 and co- edited by Lynn Roberts, Erika Derkas, Whitney Peoples, and Pamela Bridgewater- Toure, discusses over two decades of works of SisterSong. Recently Ross has spoken out against \\"call-out culture\\" and is at work on a book entitled Calling In the Calling Out Culture: Detoxing Our Movement. == Media appearances == Ross has appeared on the following North American television series and networks: CNN, BET, \\"Lead Story,\\" \\"Good Morning America,\\" \\"The Donahue Show,\\" \\"Democracy Now,\\" and \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\", Oprah Winfrey Radio, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times. == Awards and honors  Honorary degrees === * Doctorate of Civil Law from Arcadia University (2003) * Doctorate from Smith College (2013) === Selected awards === * Black Women’s Health Imperative, Community Health Activist Award (2008) * Delta Sigma Theta, Pinnacle Leadership Award (2008) * International Black Women’s Congress, Oni Award (2010) * Women Helping Women, Revolutionary Award (2011) * Foundation for Black Women's Wellness Legacy Award (2015) * National Women's Health Network Barbara Seaman Award for Activism in Women's Health (2015) * Woodhull Sexual Freedom Network, Vicky Award (2017) == Works == *Reproductive Justice: An Introduction (2017) Oakland, Calif.: University of California Press (with Rickie Solinger) *Radical Reproductive Justice: Foundation, Theory, Practice, Critique (2017) New York: Feminist Press at the City University of New York. *\\"The Color of Choice: White Supremacy and Reproductive Justice\\" in Color of Violence: The INCITE!

It has had a significant impact on collective responses to sexual harassment and sexual assault in Western academic science. Published in 2014 by a team of anthropologists, Kathryn B. H. Clancy, Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, the SAFE13 study is the first empirical investigation into scientists' experiences of harassment during fieldwork. The researchers identify three key takeaways from their work. First, women scientists are targeted more often than men, and junior scientists are also more likely to be harassed relative to senior scientists. Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment. == Methods == The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists. The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career. The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential self-selection bias. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents: :32. Have you ever personally experienced inappropriate or sexual remarks, comments about physical beauty, cognitive sex differences, or other jokes, at an anthropological field site? :39. Have you ever experienced physical sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual contact in which you could not or did not give consent or felt it would be unsafe to fight back or not give your consent at an anthropological field site? An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape. == Findings == Almost three- quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of \\"sexual harassment\\" and \\"sexual assault\\" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all \\"sexual remarks\\" as sexual harassment and all \\"unwanted sexual contact\\" as sexual assault. The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field. The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment. == SAFE2 == In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or archaeologists (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26). Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as \\"green\\" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders. The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites \\"yellow\\" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. \\"Red\\" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science. == Academic and public impact == Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a \\"chilly climate\\" in science. Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment. Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished. After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers. Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required. The SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment. It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies. The SAFE13 study is referenced in high- profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years. The study has had a major impact on American astronomy and physics in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment. In 2016, USA Rep. Jackie Speier of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill. She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews. In February 2018, the USA National Science Foundation (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment. The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the USA Congress to counter sexual harassment. This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment. On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science. The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science. Five years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment. SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the #MeToo movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment. Since 2013, scientists have consistently used the hashtag #SAFE13 in connection to other research on sexual harassment, as well as to discuss media reports and investigations on sexual harassment in science and academia, and to share personal experiences of harassment in academic science. == References == Category:Anthropology Category:Sexual harassment in the United States Category:Harassment Category:Sexual assaults in the United States Category:Women and science Category:Social sciences ","title":"SAFE13 study"},{"id":"56776542","text":"Soraya Renai (born 10 June 1987) is a former professional French female squash player. == Squash career== She competed in the Women's World Team Squash Championships in 2004 and 2006.

She worked for Disney in the 1930s and 1940s and is especially known for her work on the 1940 film Fantasia. ==Biography== Born in the village of Ampfield, England on 20 July 1900, Holland was born Sylvia Moberly was one of four children. Her father was an ordained clergyman and musician who organized an all-women string orchestra. As a child, she developed a hobby of photography after receiving a Kodak point-and-shoot camera, as well loved to draw and conduct music. As a teenager, she was enrolled at the Gloucestershire School of Domestic Science before moving to London to study at the Architectural Association School in 1919. Holland graduated in 1925, and became the first woman to join the Royal Institute of British Architects. The following year, she married Frank Holland, a fellow architecture student from Canada. The couple moved to Victoria, British Columbia and had their first child, Theodora. In Canada, Sylvia joined the Architectural Institute of British Columbia. In 1928, Sylvia, who was pregnant with their son Boris, traveled to England to see her parents leaving her husband behind at home. While she was away, Frank had developed a cold, and after some Christmas shopping in severely cold Canadian weather, he was diagnosed with an ear infection. Frank later died from mastoiditis on 28 December, a month before the birth of their son. Not long after, the Great Depression had occurred in which demand for architectural projects had plummeted. During the early 1930s, Sylvia moved her single-parent household to a farm in Metchosin. Sometime later, her son developed the same ailment as Frank, in which Sylvia was advised by a doctor to seek a drier climate. In 1936, she re-located her family to Los Angeles, but because she did not have an American degree, she could not practice as an architect. A year later, Sylvia was hired as a sketch artist by Universal Studios on several movies such as One Hundred Men and a Girl (1937) and Mad About Music (1938). After seeing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Holland decided she wanted to work for Walt Disney Productions. To gain more experience in animation, she briefly worked as a cel inker for Walter Lantz Productions. By the summer of 1938, she had heard that Disney's next film after Pinocchio (1940) would be a concert film. Excited at the news, Holland applied to work for Disney and was granted an interview with Walt Disney. On 6 September, she was hired, and became the second woman hired into their story department, following Bianca Majolie (up until then, women had only been hired to do inking and painting). Because of her background as a musician and artist, her first assignment was the Pastoral Symphony segment for Fantasia (1940). By December 1938, Holland had been asked to supervise the \\"Waltz of the Flowers\\" segment of the Nutcracker Suite. After being partnered with Majolie and fellow sketch artist Ethel Kulsar, her responsibilities at Disney included story direction, concept art, colour studies, timing, and supervising other artists. Throughout her career at the Disney studios, Walt Disney held her in high regard, noting that she was \\"a highly talented artist with a marvelous sense for decoration and color\\" who \\"contributed immensely to the good taste and beauty of our pictures\\". By April 1940, Fantasia had been finished, and Holland later developed concept art on the \\"Little April Shower\\" sequence for the 1942 film Bambi. With Mary Blair, she developed concept art for Baby Ballet, a sequence intended for a planned sequel to Fantasia that never got made. Around this same time, Holland was developing storyboards on an early version of The Little Mermaid. However, by September 1941, Holland had been laid off, but she returned back to Disney in August 1942 to develop storyboards on Victory Through Air Power (1943). By early 1945, the Disney studios had looked to salvage abandoned musical segments and combine them for the 1946 package film Make Mine Music. During production, Holland had written story treatments about Greek muses, which later became the \\"Two Silhouettes\\" sequence. Holland was laid off from Disney once again in 1946, and briefly worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She then became a children's illustrator for Whitman Publishing as well worked as a greetings card designer for MacMillan's Readers and Chryston Limited Edition. During the 1950s, she purchased three and a half acres within the San Fernando Valley in which she constructed two houses and an office on Ventura Boulevard. During the 1960s and 1970s, she also developed a past time of developing of a new breed of Siamese cats, the Balinese, which brought her international attention. On Easter Sunday 1974, Holland died from a stroke in Tarzana, California. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * ==External links== * * Category:1900 births Category:1974 deaths Category:20th-century American artists Category:20th- century American women artists Category:20th-century American women writers Category:20th-century English architects Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios people Category:American storyboard artists Category:American women illustrators Category:American illustrators Category:Animal breeders Category:British women architects ","title":"Sylvia Holland"},{"id":"56776732","text":"A fiber-optic display is a light-emitting display that uses fiber optics to display images or text.

One common use for static fiber optic displays are lane control lights, which display either a green downward-pointing arrow or a red X to indicate the open/closed status of road lanes. ==Dynamic fiber optic displays== Dynamic fiber optic displays typically display alphanumeric text, and utilize electromechanical shutters to open or close the ends of the fiber strands to display an alphanumeric pixel. These type of displays were commonly used as variable-message signs on highways.

The environment offered the settlers good living conditions, such as a mild climate, water, fertile farmland and hunting grounds. Finds from this period come from the area of Korinos, Ritini, Pigi Athinas and Makrygialos. Remains of settlements have been scarcely excavated, but found graves with various grave goods: stone and earthen figures, clay vessels, tools made of bone and stone, flint arrowheads and pieces of jewellery, which were made of bone or clay.Besios, Matheos.

The archaeological finds from this era are, inter alia, from Platamonas (the ancient Heraklion), Aiginio, Ancient Methone, Ancient Pydna, Pigi Artemidos, Trimbina, Kitros (Louloudies) and Korinos. In addition to individual tombs, necropolises and settlements were discovered. The finds from this period include clay pottery and in the earth embedded earthen storage vessels, also metal tools and weapons, and jewelry made of gold, silver, bronze and glass.Besios, Matheos.

Mycenaean period  The end of the Bronze Age is referred to as Mycenaean period in southern Greece and Crete, as these areas were under the cultural influence of Mycenae. During this time not only Mycenaean goods were traded in the Mediterranean, but also adopted Mycenaean culture and customs. Mycenaean graves and earthenware have survived from this period, the latter being very helpful in dating archeological findings. The northern limit of the spread of the Mycenaean culture is in Pieria, further north, no signs have been discovered.Efi Poulaki-Pantermali: Makedonikos Olympos.

Female slaves enjoyed certain freedoms at this festival. There was a connection between the worship of Zeus Hypsistos and the Nonae Capratinae, probably in honor of Jupiter Capitolinus, the Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The archaeological finds from the over 1000-year period from the end of the Iron Age to the end of the Roman rule over Pieria are very extensive. Dion is the leading archaeological site here, the ownership issues are clarified there, the archaeologists can work freely in a large area. Elsewhere, such as in Methone, land under which antiquities are suspected is privately owned.Anna Stroulia, Susan Buck Sutton.

From Byzantine times come the inhabited monasteries Kanalon and Agia Triada, Sparmos. Furthermore, there are numerous churches of this period, such as the Holy Trinity (Agia Triada), located above Vrondou, and the Church of the Assumption at Kontariotissa.

Her family moved to Sevenoaks where her father established a GP practice after his demobilisation. == Career == Following an education at West Heath School, Jane went on to become a reader in Mathematics at St. Andrews University, Scotland. She met her husband, Michael Wadsworth, in London and the couple moved to Edinburgh where they started their young family. Following their return to London, Jane began working part-time at the Institute for Social Sciences in Medical Care. When her youngest child began school, Jane returned to education and completed an MSc in Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene. This was followed by a series of research positions in London, Bristol and Exeter before she took on the position of Lecturer in Medical Statistics at St. Marys Hospital Medical Schooin l 1983. While with the hospital Wadsworth contributed to several clinical studies, inclining a study of pelvic pain syndrome with Professor Richard Beard and the Nation Childhood Encephalophathy Study with Professor David Miller. When the Aids epidemic arrived, Wadsworth became involved in determining the pattern of the HIV infection throughout Britain. This was the first attempt to conduct a study about sexual behaviour in the UK and gave Jane Wadsworth the opportunity to take the leading role in initiating her own research programme for the first time. During this period, Wadsworth's personal life became more strained, however, and her marriage broke up in the late 1980s. After several years of laying the foundations for sex research, Wadsworth, together with Julia Field, Anne Johnson and Kaye Wellings, embarked on a national study during which they interviewed 18,876 men and women about their sex lives. The study was filmed by Horizon for television and the women briefly found themselves in the eye of the media. In 1994, Wadsworth and her fellow researcher published Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyle detailing the results of the survey. A version of this, Sexual Behaviour in Britain, was serialised in the Independent on Sunday. As the first of its kind, the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyle (NATSAL) became both the gold standard and the model for subsequent studies for a number of countries the world. == Awards and Honours == The Jane Wadsworth clinic for Sexual Health of the Jefferiss wing at St. Marys Hospital, Paddington, was named for her. == References == Category:1942 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:British statisticians Category:Health informaticians Category:British sexologists Category:Women statisticians ","title":"Jane Wadsworth"},{"id":"56776863","text":"Jennifer Mary Body is a British aerospace engineer, the former President of the Royal Aeronautical Society. == Early life and education == Body, whose father was an aerospace engineer, was the only girl in her physics class at high school in Bristol. in 1971 she became an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering apprentice with British Aerospace.

Members of this gens are mentioned as early as the fifth century BC, but after this time they vanish into obscurity until the final century of the Republic. A number of Roscii rose to prominence in imperial times, with some attaining the consulship from the first to the third centuries.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 662 (\\"Roscia Gens\\"). ==Origin== The nomen Roscius is of uncertain origin; Chase suggests a possible derivation from roscidus, dewy or sprinkled with dew, and classifies the name with those that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.Chase, p. 131. The first of the Roscii appearing in history was a Roman ambassador, but the later Roscii may have been provincials; there was an important family of this name at Ameria, an Umbrian town not far from the border of Latium, which held the status of a municipium, and perhaps acquired Roman citizenship as early as 338 BC, at the conclusion of the Latin War.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. I, pp. 121, 122 (\\"Ameria\\"). ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Roscii were Lucius, Marcus, Quintus, Sextus, and Titus. ==Branches and cognomina== The cognomina of the Roscii during the Republic were Fabatus and Otho. Fabatus seems to be derived from faba, a bean, also the root of the nomen Fabia, and suggests that the ancestors of the Roscii were engaged in agriculture. Otho is better known as a surname of the Salvia gens.Chase, p. 113. Gallus, a cockerel, appears in a commentary on Cicero as a surname of the actor Quintus Roscius, but the name is not found in other sources.Scholia Bobiensia, In Ciceronis Pro Archia Poëta, p. 357 (ed. Orelli).Dictionary of Greek and Latin Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 662, 663 (\\"Quintus Roscius\\"). Other cognomina of the Roscii include Capito, indicating someone with a large head; Magnus, great; and Regulus, a prince, a diminutive of rex, a king.Chase, pp. 109, 111, 112. In imperial times two distinct families of the Roscii came to prominence; one bearing the surname Murena, an lamprey, well known from a family of the Licinii. This family flourished in the late first and early second centuries, and one of them bore the additional surname Lupus, a wolf. The other stirps bore the cognomen Aelianus, probably indicating descent from a family of the Aelii through the female line. This family obtained several consulships beginning at the end of the first century, and continuing into the third.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. vv. murena, lupus. ==Members== * Lucius Roscius, one of four Roman ambassadors sent to Fidenae in 438 BC, who were put to death by Lars Tolumnius, King of Veii.

He acquired three farms from Sextus' estate. * Quintus Roscius, possibly surnamed Gallus, a native of Solonium, near Lanuvium, was an illustrious comic actor during the early part of the first century BC, and became wealthy through his talents, which although well-rehearsed gave the illusion of being natural and unaffected.

The closest living relative and only surviving member of the family is the North American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana). Capromeryx furcifer is one of the smallest artiodactlys known, being at the shoulder and in weight. == Description == Capromeryx were the smallest members of the pronghorn family Antilocapridae. They are recognized by having two upright horns that are conical in shape (wider at the base and tapering toward the top). The United States distribution of this genus includes: Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington. Fossils have also been found in the Mexican states of: Chihuahua, Sonara, and Baja California. Many Capromeryx fossils have been found in tar pits, and juveniles are especially common. One such location is the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where enough bones have been unearthed to produce a full skeleton sample of Capromeryx minor. Much like the living pronghorns that exist today, the habitat that these animals were thought to inhabit were grassy plains with some shrubs and large trees for them to take refuge in. It is still unknown what exactly they ate and how they interacted socially but it is speculated that they were similar in many ways to their living relatives, the North American Pronghorn. The only living relative of Capromeryx, Antilocapra americana. == Classification == Though the identification of Capromeryx often relies on the basis of tooth size and shape, the description and acceptance of the various species of Capromeryx requires the fossil presence of horn cores (the bony inner shaft of the horn). Some species have not yet produced these cores and therefore have not been recognized as distinct species. Fossil specimens are instead classified by size. Fossils identified as the family Antilocapridae are similarly distributed into genus by size, with Capromeryx being the smallest of the known Pronghorns. There are several species of Capromeryx, however only four have been formally recognized: * Capromeryx arizonensis * Capromeryx furicifer * Capromeryx tauntonensis * Capromeryx minor Some described but unrecognized species include: * Capromeryx mexicana * Capromeryx gidleyi == Discovery and species == The earliest fossil records of Capromeryx are dated to 5 million years ago, during the Pliocene, and the most recent are dated to about 11,000 years ago around the time of their extinction. The fossils over time showed a distinct change in size for the Capromeryx, as they started out with larger bodies and distinct two pronged horns with a smaller anterior prong and a large posterior prong, and evolved to become smaller with less distinct horns, where the anterior prong was barely visible due to the decreased size under the horn sheath. The first description of C. furcifer was in 1902 by W.D. Matthew in New Mexico, but it has been found in other locations as well but by other individuals (Hay Springs, Nebraska and La Brea, California are two such locations). The first description of C. arizonensis was in 1942 by M. F. Skinner also found in New Mexico at two sites called Pearsons Mesa and Caballo. These sites are described as being late Blancan. James K. Morgan and Neil H. Morgan were the first to describe C. tauntonensis in 1995 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. They discovered the fossils that included horn cores and teeth during a dig (from 1988 to 1992) in Blancan sediments in Adams County, Washington. == Extinction == Though it is unknown why exactly Capromeryx disappeared from the North American landscape, it is evident that this genus began to decline in diversity around the time of the Late Miocene. ==References== Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Pliocene first appearances Category:Prehistoric even-toed ungulate genera Category:Prehistoric pronghorns ","title":"Capromeryx"},{"id":"56777088","text":"Zuzana Liová (born 7 October 1977) is a Slovak film director and screenwriter.

He raced only once as a two-year-old but showed considerable promise when finishing third in a top-class event at Kempton. In the following spring he came in third in the Craven Stakes before recording his biggest win in the 2000 Guineas. Although be made no impact in the Epsom Derby or the St Leger, he had further major victories in the St James's Palace Stakes Champion Stakes. He failed to win in 1924 and was retired to stud, but had little success as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Ellangowan was a bay horse bred and owned by Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery. During his racing career he was trained by Jack Jarvis at the Park Lodge at Newmarket, Suffolk. The colt was named after a location in Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering. He was one of the best horses sired by Lemberg, whose wins included the Epsom Derby, Eclipse Stakes and Champion Stakes. Lemberg also sired the Epsom Oaks winner Pogrom and was Champion sire in 1922. Ellangowan's dam Lammermuir also produced Lady Nairne, the dam of Colombo: she was a daughter of Montem, a broodmare whose other descendants included Sweet Solera, Aunt Edith and Blind Luck. ==Racing career1922: two-year-old season=== On his only start as a juvenile in 1922 Ellangowan finished third behind Twelve Pointer and Brownhylda in the International Two-year-old Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse. ===1923: three-year-old season=== Ellangowan's owner Lord Rosebery Ellangowan began his second season by running third behind Light Hand and Twelve Pointer in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in April. On 2 May 1923 Ellangowan, ridden by Charlie Elliott, started at odds of 7/1 in an eighteen-runner field for the 115th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. Twelve Pointer started favourite, while the other fancied runners included Papyrus and Pharos. In a closely contested finish Ellangowan prevailed by a head from Knockando, with the 50/1 outsider D'Orsay half a length away in third place and Papyrus fourth. The colt's victory was reportedly greeted with \\"a great outburst of enthusiasm\\" by the crowd, possibly prompted by the popularity of his owner, who had been in very poor health. An unusual feature of the result was that the racecourse judge initially announced that Legality (carrying very similar colours to Knockando) had finished second and the mistake was not corrected until many bookmakers had paid out. Ellangowan was well-fancied for the Epsom Derby but after tracking the leaders he dropped out of contention in the straight and finished eighth behind Papyrus. At Royal Ascot in June the colt was dropped back in distance for the St James's Palace Stakes and, with Elliott again in the saddle, won at odds of 3/1 from the favourite Chosroes. Ellangowan was entered in the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September but was not among the placed horses in a race won by the filly Tranquil In the Kingsclere Plate at Newbury seventeen days later the colt was beaten a length by Twelve Pointer, to whom he was conceding five pounds in weight. In October Ellangowan attempted to record his third major success of the year in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in which he started at odds of 11/4 in a four- runner field. After looking beaten in the last quarter mile he rallied strongly in the final furlong to win by a neck from Legality with Twelve Pointer a neck away in third. Ellangowan ended the season with winnings of £14,885, making him the second most financially successful horse of 1923 in England. ===1924: four-year-old season=== Ellangowan remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win on his only start. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Ellangowan an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== At the end of his racing career Ellangowan was acquired by the partnership of Jack Javis, John Fox and Rowland Rank and was retired to become a breeding stallion. His most successful offspring included Tartan, who won the Britannia Stakes in 1933. Ellangowan was euthanised in September 1943. ==Pedigree== * Ellangowan was inbred 4 × 4 to Isonomy, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1920 racehorse births Category:1943 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 11-f Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Ellangowan (horse)"},{"id":"56777265","text":"The Steaua Stadium (), informally also known as Ghencea, is a multi-purpose stadium under construction in Bucharest, Romania.

She has been the monitor engineer for Pearl Jam and Eddie Vedder for over 25 years http://www.soundgirls.org/traveling-the-long-road-karrie-keyes/ and has toured with Soundgarden, Fugazi, Sonic Youth, Neil Young, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Keyes was one of very few women working as a live sound engineer in the 1980s and is recognized for her contributions to helping women in the sound industry (which is estimated to be 95% men). She was a 2017 honoree of the She Rocks Awards. == Youth == Keyes was born and raised in Los Angeles. She would \\"fall in love\\" with songs she heard on the radio. She took music lessons from third grade to middle school (playing flute and clarinet) and gravitated towards the arts and music in high school. She was a fan of music who attended concerts and shows. In high school, she wasn't presented with career options in the music industry. She aspired to be a writer and to travel the world. Keyes was a fan of punk music as a teenager. At 17, she was taking some classes at a community college and worked a part-time job in retail. == Early Industry Years == Her first opportunity in sound came when she met sound engineer Dave Rat in 1986 at a Black Flag show on the In My Head tour. She was 17 at the time. Keyes worked her way to the front before the show and talked to Rat. He invited Keyes to the stage after the show and taught her how to wrap mic cables. The next day, she was in Palo Alto with Black Flag and knew she wanted to do sound. Dave Rat owned a sound company, Rat Sound, and brought Keyes to work for him. Her first job was loading and unloading PA equipment from trucks at shows. She learned how to setup sound systems, do wiring and set change, how the gear worked, and troubleshooting. Rat Sound did a lot of punk rock shows in Southern California and the two did most shows themselves (with the occasional third person). Keyes was able to quit her part-time job and not go back to school. She was taking any job offered from punk music to gospel to mariachi. Keyes and Rat lived in a warehouse without hot water for two years so they could put money back into the business (for expenses like equipment, insurance and gas). She worked for Rat Sound from 1986-2005. In addition to sound work, she helped with accounting and bills and in her final five years, HR and management. == Monitor Engineer == Keyes has primarily worked as a monitor engineer for live sound who does not do front of house or studio work. Her first tour was with The Untouchables working as a system tech for their Southern California gigs. When their front of house engineer left, she moved into mixing monitors for them until 1990. Keyes was monitor engineer for The Red Hot Chili Peppers who she toured with from 1990-2000. She met Pearl Jam in 1991 when they were opening for RHCP on the Blood Sugar Sex Magic Tour. In 1995, Keyes toured with Neil Young on the Mirror Ball Tour. She was hired to tour with Fugazi because she did their location shows regularly and knew what they needed. Keyes says monitor mixing is \\"not for the weak of heart.\\" She says it's considered one of the most difficult jobs on tour. == Pearl Jam == Pearl Jam hired Keyes in 1992 to finish their tour, which she did between RHCP tours. Keyes said the crew is like family because of how long they have been together. As of 2016, the band uses a mix of in-ear monitors and wedges (Rat S Wedges for Eddie Vedder and EAW Microwedges for the rest of the band). The lead guitar player (Mike McCready) relies mainly on in-ear monitors. Keyes uses a DiGiCo SD5 console for their shows. Some Pearl Jam fans recognize her as the \\"microphone girl\\" because she is on stage checking mics before the show begins. == SoundGirls == Keyes co-founded SoundGirls in 2013 with Michelle Sabolchick Pettinato with the mission of \\"empowering the next generation of women in audio.\\" SoundGirls is looking to increase the number of women in the workforce, which is currently at 5 percent. Keyes and Sabolchick met when they were on a panel together at the 2012 AES Convention in San Francisco. The panel was hosted by the Women's Audio Mission called \\"Women of Professional Concert Sound\\" and was moderated by Terri Winston, the founder of WAM. The five panelists had never met before but found a lot of similarities in their experiences, work ethics and interests. They also recognized they had hadn't crossed paths or been able to support each other but they bonded \\"like sisters.\\" Keyes and Pettinato decided to do something after. The original idea of Soundgirls was to create a website where women in audio could meet and network. Since then, SoundGirls has grown to over 4,000 members and chapters worldwide. The organization assists with mentorships, job placement, workshops, and scholarships. The organization is inclusive of all genders and non-conforming genders. Keyes is currently the executive director and runs the organization on a daily basis. In 2015, SoundGirls started holding recording camps in the summer for girls. These events are held in California, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. In 2018, SoundGirls teamed up with Spotify to create the EQL Directory, an international database for women working in audio and music production. Keyes says of women in the industry, \\"Women must work harder, smarter, and be tougher, and by being those things is how you overcome adversity. Since starting SoundGirls I have learned that the issues women face are not limited to women; it affects all marginalized people. The industry needs diversity.\\" == Personal Life == Keyes and Dave Rat had twin daughters in 1997 and Keyes toured while pregnant. They continued to work together professionally for many years. The two tried to balance their tour schedules as much as possible and Keyes likened it to a military family where a parent may be gone for months at a time. She says of being a working mom, \\"\\"It took me probably till they were three or four to actually come to terms with, 'You know what, I'm actually a better mother if I'm doing what I love doing.' So that when I'm here, I'm completely here.\\" Keyes has been based in California for most of her career but lived in Seattle briefly during the Grunge era. One of her daughters has worked on the Warped Tour. == Awards == Keyes was an honoree at the 2017 She Rocks Awards at the NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA. The She Rocks awards honors women who stand out within the music industry. == External Links == *Karrie Keyes Interview NAMM Oral History Library (2020) == References == Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:American audio engineers Category:Pearl Jam Category:People from Los Angeles ","title":"Karrie Keyes"},{"id":"56777357","text":"The 1989 World Table Tennis Championships – Men's Doubles was the 40th edition of the men's doubles championship.

With the added dedication to Yakov Polonsky, it featured in the 1888 Rasskazy (Рассказы, Stories) collection. Chekhov included it into volume four of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1900. During its author's lifetime, the story was translated into German, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak and Czech languages.Commentaries to Счастье] // Чехов А. П. Полное собрание сочинений и писем: В 30 т.

[Рассказы], 1887. — М.: Наука, 1976. — С. 210—218. ==Background== Chekhov wrote \\"Happiness\\" soon after making a visit to Taganrog, in May 1887, in the village of Babkino (then the estate of count Alexey S. Kiselyov) where he spent three summers, in 1885-1887. The setting of the narrative is apparently the Northern Taganrog region, for the Saur Grave (Саур-Могила) is here mentioned, the burial site, around which numerous legends had evolved, one of which Vladimir Korolenko retold in one of his sketches.Огонек, 957, № 32, стр. 18. Близ «Савур-могилы». Из старой за писной книжки Вл. Короленко. Scary stories related to the children in their early years by their nurse Agafya Kumskaya might also have had some bearing upon this story, according to Mikhail Chekhov.Антон Чехов и его сюжеты, стр. 14 On more than one occasion Chekhov referred to \\"Happiness\\" as his best loved story and, while working on the collection Rasskazy insisted that it should open it. In January 1887 Yakov Polonsky published a poem called \\"U dveri\\" (At the Door) with a dedication to Chekhov. In the 25 March 1888 letter Chekhov wrote to Polonsky: \\"I am going to release my new collection of stories. It will feature the one called \\"Happiness\\" which I consider my best ever. I'd like to ask for your permission to dedicate it to you... It is about the steppe, the plane, the night, pale sunrise, flock of sheep and three silhouettes, talking about happiness.\\"Я издаю новый сборник своих рассказов. В этом сборнике будет помещен рассказ «Счастье», который я считаю самым лучшим из всех своих рассказов. Будьте добры, позвольте мне посвятить его Вам. Этим Вы премного обяжете мою музу. В рассказе изображается степь: равнина, ночь, бледная заря на востоке, стадо овец и три человеческие фигуры, рассуждающие о счастьи. Чехов - Я. П. Полонскому, 25 марта 1888. Москва. ==Plot summary== Two shepherds, a decrepit, toothless man of eighty, and his young counterpart, guarding a huge flock of sheep, have to spend the night by the broad steppe road. A man with a horse stops to ask for a light for his pipe. The old man recognizes him as Panteley, a land supervisor at the nearby Kovyli village, then informs him of the death of \\"a wicked old man\\" called Zhmenya, in whose presence melons whistled and pikes laughed. The latter's major fault though, from the speaker's point of view, was that he’d known where all the local treasures were hidden but would not tell anyone. After that the conversation evolves around this issue: it appears that gold and silver are in abundance here in the kurgans, but nobody can find them, because all of them are under the spell. The old man warms up to the subject, which he seems to be obsessed with. It appears that he'd made numerous attempts at diggings, craving to find his 'happiness', but to no avail: all the treasures in the vicinity must have been put under spell. \\"But what will you do with the treasure when you find it?\\" the young man enquires. \\"I know what I'll do. I'll… I’ll show them!..\\" the old man promises but does not go beyond that. The conversation lasts until daybreak. Finally the supervisor leaves, apparently deeply moved by the information he had received. Even more meaningfully thoughtful look the sheep all around. ==Critical reception== Alexander Chekhov On 14 June 1887 Alexander Chekhov wrote to his brother: \\"Well, my friend, you've made quite a stir with your last 'steppe' subbotnik. This piece is wonderful. Everybody talks about it. The praises are of the most ferocious nature... Burenin is composing a panegyric for you for the second week and still cannot finish it, finding difficulties with expressing himself clear enough... What everybody likes about this story is that, while lacking an actual theme it still succeeds in making such an impression. The sun rays, sliding across the land as the sun rises, cause storms of rapture, and the sleeping sheep are depicted in such a lively, magical and picturesque way that I am sure you’ve become a ram yourself while portraying all this sheepishness.\\"The Letters by Alexander Chekhov // Письма Ал. Чехова, стр. 165—166. \\"The steppe subbotnik is dear to my heart exactly for its theme, which you, the flock, failed to notice in it,\\" Chekhov retorted in his 21 June letter. Issak Levitan The story was praised by Isaak Levitan, whose friendship with Chekhov started in Babkino, in summer 1885. \\"...You struck me as landscape-artist... In Happiness the pictures of the steppe, the kurgans, the sheep are extraordinary. Yesterday I showed this story to S.P. and Lika,Sofia Kuvshinnikova, who in 1892 became a prototype for the Olga Dymova character in \\"The Grasshopper\\", and Lika Mizinova. and both were delighted,\\" he wrote in June.Isaak Levitan. Letters, Documents, Memoirs // И. И. Левитан. Письма, документы, воспоминания. М., 1956, стр. 37. The original press reviews were mixed. Konstantin Arsenyev found the story \\"too stark and lacking both content and those wondrous details that often greatly empower the Chekhov sketches,\\" he wrote in Vestnik Evropy. Reviewing the collection Rasskazy, Novoye Vremya rated \\"Happiness\\" as one of the best Chekhov stories ever, praising the author's taste for nuances and his deep knowledge of the country folk's ways. \\"Chekhov's characters always speak the language of the region they live in, and there is nothing artificial or contrived in their mindsets,\\" the anonymous reviewer noted. Once the term 'impressionism' became in vogue in the Russian press, the story became almost synonymous with the new trend in literature.Е. Ляцкий: «...импрессионизм творческой манеры г. Чехова достигает высокой степени развития». - «Вестник Европы», 1904, № 1, стр. 157. The in-depth analysis of the story was provided by the critic I.V. Ivanov (who used the penname I. Johnson). In his 1904 essay called \\"Seeking for Truth and the Meaning of Life\\", published by Obrazovaniye, he argued that for Chekhov, after the \\"early period of superficial mirth for mirth's sake\\" there followed \\"the new phase of objective artistic contemplation of life…almost scientific in its approach.\\" As a result, he started to produce stories the leitmotif for which was the idea that human life as such lacks any kind of moral law, reason or meaning. The pinnacle of this series, according to Johnson, was \\"Happiness\\", according to which \\"...life ha[d] neither reason, no meaning and man is reduced almost to naught. But not all life is such. One has to climb up one of those hills... to realize: there is out there a different life, which has nothing to do with subterranean happiness and sheepish ways of thinking.\\"В нарисованной им жизни, или — если хотите, шире — в той, которую она символизирует, разум и смысл отсутствуют, человек в ней — почти ничто; но не вся жизнь на свете такова. Если, например, взобраться на один из высоких холмов, о которых говорилось выше, то станет видно — что на этом свете, кроме молчаливой степи и вековых курганов, есть другая жизнь, которой нет дела до зарытого счастья и овечьих мыслей... ==NotesReferences * Счастье, the original Russian text * Happiness, English translation Category:Short stories by Anton Chekhov Category:1887 short stories Category:Works originally published in Russian newspapers ","title":"Happiness (short story)"},{"id":"56777378","text":"Provincial elections were held in the Pakistani province of Balochistan on 11 May 2013, alongside nationwide general elections and three other provincial elections in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. The remaining two territories of Pakistan, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, were ineligible to vote due to their disputed status. ==Background== The 2013 elections resulted in a hung parliament, before Pakistan Muslim League (N), National Party, and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party joined hands to form a coalition government. A power-sharing agreement was also brokered between PML-N and NP where the province's Chief Ministership tenure would be bifurcated between the two parties. In consequence, NP's Abdul Malik Baloch served as chief minister from 2013 to 2015 before he was replaced by PML-N's Sanaullah Khan Zehri at the end of 2015. However, Zehri couldn't complete his term as on 2 January 2018, a number of dissident members from the ruling PML-N colluded with opposition lawmakers to submit a no-confidence motion against him. Seeing that he has lost the majority of the house's support in the ensuing turmoil, Zehri resigned from his post before a no-confidence vote could take place. Pakistan Muslim League (Q)'s, Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, an opposition lawmaker and one of the leaders of the no-confidence bloc, was elected as the province's 15th Chief Minister.

She began her career as a graduate student under Paul Sears, the chair of the botany department at the University of Oklahoma. Sears gave his students the freedom to explore unique topics in order to design their own theses. Draper took advantage of this, and during her time working and studying under Sears, she published two major papers entitled, \\"A Demonstration of the Technique of Pollen Analysis\\"Draper, Phyllis. A Demonstration of the Technique of Pollen Analysis. and \\"A Comparison of Pollen Spectra of Old and Young Bogs in the Erie Basin.\\" She believed that the fossil pollen could be used to make inferences about the climates of specific regions. Her first pollen graph showed the pollen in New Haven Bog, which included pteridophyte spores, grasses, pines, oak, and larch, and unknown pollen. She later updated this pollen diagram and developed another one for the Curtis Bog. Draper graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1929 with an M.S. in botany. She died on August 8, 2000. == First North American pollen diagram == In 1928, Phyllis Draper was the first in North America to develop what would become one of the most common practices used in palynology - the pollen diagram. While attending the University of Oklahoma as a MS student, her first experience with this technique was during her study of New Haven Pond in New Haven, Ohio. Her study described the collection of the bog's subsurface peat that she called \\"borings.\\" She used data from peat that had been separated and analyzed the pollen grains that had been boiled pollen in slightly basic conditions using potassium hydroxide. These were the data that she used to count the recurrence of different types of pollen. Her first ever pollen graph included pteridophyte spores, unknown spores, grasses, pines, oak, and larch. The patterns of the pollen graph represented the percentages of each listed species at various depths. The graph, however, did not have the axes labels that are standard today (depth on the y-axis and percent abundance on the x-axis). She admitted that her work could not lead to any conclusions due to the incompleteness of her results. == Second publication == Phyllis Draper went on to expand the results from her first study and compare them to another bog, known as Curtis bog in Lucas country, Ohio. The goal of this study was to understand the origins of both locations based on the pollen collected in the peat samples. The methods of this study were more descriptive, but had many parallels with her previous paper, including the separation of the peat and the boiling of the pollen samples in potassium hydroxide. The samples were collected by Paul Sears. With more extensive data, Phyllis Draper was able to expand her previous pollen diagram of New Haven Bog. The methods section of the paper explained that depth went as deep as 10 feet subsurface. The y-axis depicts this depth with 1 at the top and 10 at the bottom, indicating that top to bottom was read as the \\"newest to oldest\\" sedimentation. This is the typical layout for pollen diagrams today. Across the x-axis was the percentage of each pollen type. Draper now had data for more species and was able to find a forest succession pattern present in the New Haven Bog via the observed disappearance and reappearance of trees with a dominance of conifer species. This was compared to Curtis Bog, which lacked the succession pattern. The overall goal of this paper was to compare the basal ages of the two bogs. This was not achieved because of unsuccessful dating techniques. == Later life == After Draper graduated from the University of Oklahoma with an M.S. in botany, she was featured in an alumni news magazine and was recognized for becoming a teacher. She became a botany instructor at the University of Tennessee where she studied atmospheric pollen and advised students. == References == Category:University of Oklahoma alumni Category:1907 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Palynologists ","title":"Phyllis Draper"},{"id":"56777405","text":"Jacques Vilcoq (born 1942) is a French coxswain.

The Marquise de La Ferté-Imbault by Nattier (1740) A first fortress was built around 980 by Humbold (or Humbault) Le Tortu,Translated from: » [archive], sur Le Royaume des Lanturelus Seigneur de Vierzon and son-in-law of Thibault, comte de Blois. The proximity of the Sauldre feeds the moat. The bases of the two main towers remain to this day as the old weapons room. Hervé 1st, Seigneur de Vierzon and descendant of Humbold, had built on his return from the crusade, a collegiate in honor of Saint-Taurin. This ecclesiastical presence and the need to supply the fortress favor the emergence of the village of La Ferté-Imbault which is built around. In 1280 Jeanne de Vierzon, heiress of the lands of La Ferté-Imbault, weds Geoffroy de Brabant, comte d'Aerschot, son of duc Henry III de Brabant and Adelaide de Bourgogne (Burgundy). Geoffroy de Brabant was the brother-in-law of the King of France, Philip III the Bold. His daughter, Alix de Brabant, married Jean III d'Harcourt in 1302. His marriage to Alix de Brabant, a rich heiress who brought him the seigneurie of La Ferté-Imbault, made him a close relative of the Duke of Brabant and the Kings of France, because Alix is also the niece of the Queen of France, Marie de Brabant. The son of Jean III d'Harcourt and Alix de Brabant, Jean IV, first comte d'Harcourt, marries Isabeau de Parthenay. Their sons Guillaume d'Harcourt is the seigneur of La Ferté-Imbault. From his marriage to Blanche de Bray, Dame de Cernon, they had one daughter, Jeanne d'Harcourt, Dame de La Ferte-Imbault, who married Hugues de Montmorency. Their sons, Louis and Antoine, died at the Battle of Azincourt in 1415 for the first, and Verneuil in 1424 for the second. Their sister, Catherine de Montmorency, inherits the vast estate of La Ferté-Imbault after the death of her two brothers. During the Hundred Years War, the castle was taken and destroyed by the troops of Edward the Black Prince, as well as the village. After having belonged without interruption during several centuries to the dynasty of Humbold Le Tortu, Seigneur of Vierzon, by the alliance of the families of Brabant, Harcourt and Montmorency, the estate is sold by Catherine de Montmorency to Robert II d'Estampes, Seigneur de Valençay, in 1424.Translated from: Henry-René Bertrand, , 1960, Seigneurie de La Ferté- Imbaul Joan of Arc stayed at La Ferté-Imbault on March 4, 1429.

Jacques d'Estampes, head of the House of d'Estampes, was also be the first marquis of La Ferté-Imbault. His eldest son was Seigneur de Salbris. Born in the reign of Henry IV, the marquis de La Ferté-Imbault died in the reign of Louis XIV, after fighting alongside Louis XIII (whose bust still adorns the former guardhouse of the château). He was ambassador to England (1641-1643), lieutenant-general of Orléanais, Vendômois and Dunois (1645), and marshal of France (1651). Louis XIV made him knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit (1661). His friendship with HRH Gaston of France, Duc d'Orléans and brother of Louis XIII (Monsieur, the King's brother), was flawless throughout his life, and it is as a lieutenant of the company of the Gendarmes of the Duc d 'Orléans (in 1620) that he had huge commons built at the Château de La Ferté-Imbault to accommodate his company.

The château knows its apogee at the Grand-Siècle. The hearts of the maréchal d'Estampes and his wife, Madame la Marquise d'Estampes de la Ferté-Imbault, remained at La Ferté-Imbault, in the chapel of Saint-Taurin, under a moving epitaph. The full-length portrait of the maréchal d'Estampes de La Ferté-Imbault was made in 1835 by Jean-Leonard Lugardon on the orders of King Louis-Philippe. It is in the sixth hall of the marshals, the historical museum of the Palace of Versailles. In the eighteenth century, the Regent who ruled France since the death of Louis XIV, renamed the regiment of Chartres-Infantry to give it the name of La Ferté-Imbault regiment. The eastern view of the domain, showing the Renaissance facades of the château In 1743, King Louis XV acquired the marquisate of La Ferte-Imbault for his mistress, Madame de La Tournelle, on whom he wanted to confer a prestigious title to present to the court. Madame de La Tournelle eventually became Duchesse de Châteauroux. Seal of Geoffroy de Brabant, Lord of Vierzon The last marquise de La Ferté-Imbault was Marie-Thérèse Geoffrin d'Estampes,Translated from: Marie-Thérèse de La Ferté-Imbault daughter of the illustrious Madame Geoffrin, whose literary salon in the rue Saint-Honoré radiated throughout Europe and as far as Russia where the Empress Catherine II wrote to her as a friend. The beautiful marquise, whose magnificent painting by Nattier is exhibited in Tokyo at the Fuji Art Museum, enjoyed at La Ferté \\"the freshness of large chestnut trees that extend their shade at the end of the Commons\\". Her presence was, however, requested in Versailles, where, on the recommendation of the governess of the Enfants de France, the comtesse de Marsan, Louis XV asked her to teach philosophy to his granddaughters,Translated from: Baronne d'Oberkirch, , \\"Quant à la marquise de La Ferté-Imbault, chez laquelle nous nous rendîmes ensuite, c'est la fille de la célèbre madame Geoffrin. Elle a épousé le petit-fils du maréchal de La Ferté-d'Etampes, et a été sous-gouvernante des enfants de France. C'est elle qui a fait l'éducation de Madame Elisabeth.

Sa maison était le rendez-vous des beaux-esprits, mais ses idées ne ressemblaient pas à celles de sa mère, au contraire; elle haïssait les philosophes, et je ne l'en blâme pas.

She also provided Madame de Marsan with texts for the little comedies played by the princesses to whom the Dauphin and the Dauphine (Marie Antoinette) were present. Madame de La Ferté-Imbault will be invited to the coronation of Louis XVI in Reims on June 11, 1775. Smart, a woman of letters having regularly attended in the salon of her mother most of the great minds of the Enlightenment (Diderot, Voltaire, Fontenelle, Montesquieu who was his tutor, D'Alembert ...), and never remarried despite his young widowhood (and several marriage proposals including that of Stanislas Leszczynski, King of Poland, and father of the Queen of France Marie Leszczynska, who called la marquise \\"his Imbault\\" Translated from: Constantin Photiadès, , Plon, 1928, 282 p., pages 75 et 76), Madame de La Ferté-Imbault was recognized for her culture and her moral qualities.Translated from: « » [archive] Queen of the \\"Sublime Order of Lanturelus\\", brotherhood of beautiful minds, she knows how to resist the intrigues of the Court, and attach the friendship of the Royal Family (including Madame Elizabeth who wrote to her \\"You must love, said a princess.

The French Revolution saw the fall of the House of d'Estampes and the loss of influence of the Château de La Ferté-Imbault. Its surrounding village was then attached to the neighboring town of Selles-Saint-Denis. The two wings of the château were torn down. The marquis de Pierrecourt, son of Sophie d'Estampes, owner of the château, was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror. He sold the estate in 1807 to the Comte de Belmont. The widow of the latter sold it in 1819 to the comtesse de Grandeffe. The main facade In May 1824, a rich English family, the Leeds-Kirby from Leeds, acquired the estate of La Ferte-Imbault and moved to the château. They modernized local agriculture by adopting English cultural innovations (forage plants and improving crops, such as clover and alfalfa) in their many farms spread over 5,000 hectares. The presence of this foreign family was unappreciated in the village. For example, during the Revolution of 1830, the population of La Ferté-Imbault, armed with pitchforks and spades, invaded the château and sought to lynch the fleeing owner. The Protestant practice of the family, coupled with a strong proselytism, led to serious opposition to the village community throughout the nineteenth century, as in 1868 during the construction of the new parish church of Saint-Taurin, built in front of the main entrance to the château. When William Lee died in 1853, his nephew and niece inherited the estate of La Ferté-Imbault and the estate was divided into two parts, the Sauldre forming the boundary. Mary-Ann Kirby received the château and part of the farms on 3,500 hectares, while Edward Howarth, his brother, received other farms and the area of La Place on the right bank of the river (on which a new château was built between 1880 and 1883), for a total surface of 1,500 hectares.Translated from: Conrad de Gourcy, Imprimerie de Ch. Lahure et Compagnie, Terre et château de la Ferté- Imbault, primitivement à M. Lee et aujourd'hui exploités par MM. Kirby et Edwards. Pages 99-101 The village regained its administrative independence in 1860 but faced financial problems. The former collegiate church near the château was destroyed. The château, whose land was significantly reduced after 1872 (to a little over 1,100 hectares), was bought by Comte Fresson. His niece, Marie Say, one of the richest heiresses of France and owner of the Château de Chaumont-sur-Loire, married Prince Amédée de Broglie, then HRH prince Louis-Ferdinand d'Orléans-Bourbon, Infant of Spain. Many trips were undertaken between these two châteaux united by family ties. The park of about 50 hectares was fenced at that time by a brick wall and embellished with ornaments. Le maréchal d'Estampes The Château de la Ferté-Imbault, sold in 1900 to Dr. Georges Bouilly, then become the property of Henry-René Bertrand, and was seized by the Kommandantur on June 17, 1940, and saw four years of German occupation. The building suffered extensive damage during a bombing raid on May 8, 1944. In August 1960, a \\"sound and light\\" show tracing its millennial history was organized in the castle with the voices of the actors Madeleine Sologne and André Le Gall. It has since been sold to new private owners and is open to visitors during the summer period. ==Architecture== The present stately home is the one restored by marshal d'Estampes during the first quarter of the 17th century and completed in 1627. It is a high brick building erected on an old mound leveled in a succession of two terraces above the moat. The building is located behind (north side) by the two cylindrical towers of the sixteenth century that resisted the fire of 1562, and in front (south side) by two polygonal towers whose base goes back to the construction of the medieval castle. The facade delimited by these last towers is dominated by an imposing fore-body covered with a pyramidal dome and crowned with a lantern and bells (also called the bell tower). The stone appears in tables and alternating claveaux around the windows.Translated from: Philippe Seydoux, , Éditions de la Morande, 1992, 112 p., p. La Ferté-Imbault, pages 48 et 49. Three slate roofs are built parallel to this façadeTranslated from: Serge Rousseau-Vellones, , Les Nouvelles Éditions latines, \\"La Ferté-Imbault\\" page 19 Several large windows of the eastern facade retain a Renaissance decor made of grotesques and historical medallions. This facade also has a polychrome grid and testifies that the stone was hardly used to play a decorative role. In the main building, were added two wings disappeared for one at the end of the eighteenth century and for the other at the beginning of the nineteenth century, following a fire (which also destroyed the main wood staircase located in the bell tower, rebuilt in 1830). Two pavilions are built at the end of the moat: the first for the guardhouse and the second for kitchens with a well that still exists, and whose ground floor is vaulted by a series of powerful arches diaphragms in brick. The moats that surround this quadrilateral on all sides are built with a bridge that spans them. Four watch-towers (two of which are still standing) with domes are arranged, pierced with openings to allow shots, which stand at the corners of the walkway overlooking the moat.Translated from: « » [archive], sur Base Mérimée The roofs of the pavilions resumed the shape adopted by the fore-body of the dwelling and that of the escugettesTranslated from: Bernard Toulier, , Imprimerie Nationale, 1991 The Château The bridge gives access to two large bodies of common, particularly remarkable, which frame the forecourt of the château: they served as stables and cantonment for the company of Gendarmes of the Duc d'Orléans that the marshal d'Estampes directed \\"the installation of the light horse that he maintains in his superb common is reassuring for all\\".Translated from: Gilberte Espouy, , 2000, \\"Un châtelain sur ses terres\\" page 129) These outbuildings were to house a total population of 600 including officers, 120 horsemen, grooms, farriers and about 240 horses. These long outbuildings are framed by large pavilions covered with high eaves. The farm with housing, barns and kennel was rebuilt a little further apart in the barnyard. The magnificent red brick ensemble is typical of the classicism that developed at the end of the Renaissance and during the reign of Louis XIII. In the mid-nineteenth century, when the château was owned by the English Lee- Kirby family, large neo-Gothic arcades were placed in front of the medieval base of the main facade, and the imperial roofs of the pavilions destroyed by fire in 1830 were rebuilt in the form of two-slope English-inspired roofs. The area which now extends over fifty hectares is enclosed by a brick wall surrounded by the Sauldre. Marshal d'Estampes had French gardens (transformed in the nineteenth century according to the English fashion), built an orangery, and dug a vast 600-meter canal, fed by the river, which survived. A vegetable garden, a cooler, meadows, cultivated land and woodlands make up a romantic territory. A network of star alleys serves the park. Many species of trees are found there as well as an abundant game. ==References Further Reading: == * List of Châteaux of Loir-et-Cher * List of historical monuments of Loir-et-Cher * Jacques d'Estampes Category:Châteaux in Loir-et-Cher Category:Châteaux of the Loire Valley Category:Monuments historiques of Centre-Val de Loire Category:Ancien Régime French architecture ","title":"Château de La Ferté-Imbault"},{"id":"56777732","text":"Andrei Kovacs (born 23 November 1921) was a Romanian alpine skier.

It is placed in the subgenus Stauropora, making its full name Holothuria (Stauropora) fuscocinerea. It is native to shallow water in the tropical and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific. == Description == This sea cucumber has an oval, cylindrical body, flattened somewhat on the underside, and rounded at both ends. It can reach a length of but is a more normal size. The adult weighs between . The mouth is on the underside at the front and is surrounded by twenty short, brown, branched feeding tentacles. The anus is dark brown or black and has no anal teeth, but is surrounded by five white-tipped papillae. There are Cuvierian tubules in this species. The skin is soft, thick and wrinkled, often with sand adhering to it. It varies in colour, the upperside usually being greyish or brownish, while the underside is a dirty white. There is often a series of dark bars in the transverse wrinkles. ==Distribution== H. fuscocinerea has a widespread distribution in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its range extends from East Africa and the Red Sea to southern Japan, northern Australia and Central America. It is typically found on coral rubble and soft sediments, and among seagrasses. It usually occurs at depths of less than but can occur down to . ==Ecology== H. fuscocinerea is a detritivore and feeds at night, sifting through the sediment with its feeding tentacles, swallowing the sediment and extracting the bacteria and organic material it contains, while the sand passes on through its gut. Breeding takes place in the hot season. The sexes are separate in this species; they climb to an elevated location before releasing their gametes into the water column. Females produce an average of around three million eggs. The larvae are pelagic and drift with the plankton. When sufficiently developed they settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles. Like other sea cucumbers, the tissues contain saponins which are distasteful and toxic to fish, causing haemolysis of the red blood cells, which can be fatal. The skin periodically flakes off in little shreds, and fish can sometimes be seen nibbling these. This desquamation may be a method for the sea cucumber to rid itself of metabolic waste. ==Status== This is a common species of sea cucumber. It is of little commercial importance to fisheries, but is sometimes used for food, especially in China, the Philippines and Malaysia. It may be used more for this purpose if other more palatable species become depleted. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". == References == Category:Holothuriidae Category:Animals described in 1833 ","title":"Holothuria fuscocinerea"},{"id":"56777847","text":"Quintus Aurelius Polus Terentianus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service.

His earliest recorded activity comes from a pair of fragmentary dedications to various Roman gods he set up at Mainz., The one in the best condition, dedicated to Liber and Apollo, attests that he was legatus or commander of Legio XXII Primigenia and Legio II Augusta, as well as being one of the fetiales. Senators rarely commanded more than one legion in their career; in compiling a list of all men known to have commanded two or more, Birley identified only 33 men.Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, pp. 18-20 This only happened in unusual cases, and Birley explains that Terentianus was sent from Mainz, where Legio XXII was stationed, to Roman Britain, where Legio II was stationed, due to unusual circumstances. Either he was to replace the legionary legatus Priscus, one of the commanders of the mutinous British legions; or Terentianus was sent to replace one of the equites appointed by the praetorian prefect Tigidius Perennis, who subsequently fell from power. \\"At all events, Terentianus ought to have taken up his command in 185 or 186.\\" Birley suggests Terentianus held one further praetorian post, which was followed by the consulship. He was appointed governor of the imperial province of Roman Dacia probably before the death of Commodus in the year 192; his appointment may have been engineered by the praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus, as part of his coup against Commodus. He was governor no later than 195, when the brother of Septimus Severus was appointed to govern the province.

Moore had worked with Alan Woods and Bill Benter to develop computerized systems which successfully predicted the outcome of horse races. ==Gambling career== Moore arrived in Hong Kong in 1983 with only AUD$5 on him. There he worked with Alan Woods, a successful blackjack player, and devised a system for betting on the outcome of horse races. Moore made a fortune and was known for his flamboyance. Moore allegedly bought a bar from the owner to fire a manager who asked him to wait in line for a pool table. Another story about Moore involved a Hong Kong pool bar called the Flying Pig. After being annoyed with waiting for one of the two pool tables at the bar, Moore threatened the owners that he would purchase the Chinese restaurant downstairs and open a bar with three pool tables, which he did. According to Woods, such behavior cost Moore millions. Moore often wagered up to $2 million per day on horse races and received an annual return of 38%.

He was discovered by his wife. ==See also== * Billy Walters (gambler) ==References== Category:New Zealand gamblers Category:1953 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Horse racing Category:Drug-related suicides in China Category:Drug- related deaths in Hong Kong ","title":"Robert Moore (gambler)"},{"id":"56777895","text":"Lampadioteuthis megaleia is a small, colorful squid from the family Lycoteuthidae, it is the only species in the only genus in the monotypic subfamily Lampadioteuthinae, it is sometimes known as the wonderful firefly squid. It differs from the other species of the Lycoteuthidae mainly by having a hectocotylus in the males and by the possession of a rostrum on the gladius. ==Description== Lampadioteuthis megaleia is a small squid which grows to a mantle length of 40 mm. In males the right ventral arm is hectocotylized with an enlarged protective membrane over the mid-arm. It has four ocular photophores, arranged as three in a ventral line and one positioned laterally. The tentacles have five photophores which are set on a stalk. There are circular anal photophores on either side of the rectum, single elongated branchial photophores lie at the base of each gill, there are no abdominal photophores and a single photophore is situated to the rear of the abdomen between the inner surface of mantle and the viscera. There are a lot of functional chromatophores which are covered by a violet pigmented external skin. The males have a penis. ==Distribution== Lampadioteuthis megaleia occurs in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean in the Gulf Stream and the northern Sargasso Sea and in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Its type locality is the Kermadec Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, In the eastern North Atlantic it has been reported from between the Azores and Spain south to 25°N while in the western North Atlantic it has been recorded at 40°N. ==Habitat and biology== Lampadioteuthis megaleia is found in the upper mesopelagic to epipelagic zones. Little is known about its life history but the violet pigmentation in the skin lying over its photophores is assumed to act as a colour filter which enables the bioluminescence to be a closer match to the colour of the sun or moonlight downwelling from the surface. The photophores of species of squid in the genus Lycoteuthis have a very similar type of detached filter. Small, less than 8mm in mantle length, subadults have been found which are very similar to adults, except that some of the body proportions differ, the size of the photophores and only having the large photophore at the base of each tentacle. The paralarva are planktonic. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Cephalopod genera Category:Molluscs described in 1916 Category:Monotypic mollusc genera Category:Bioluminescent molluscs ","title":"Lampadioteuthis"},{"id":"56777924","text":"Mešanović () is a Bosnian surname.

Forming as a broad tropical disturbance on 5 March, the system slowly consolidated over the next few days before developing into a tropical cyclone on 6 March. Afterwards, a pinhole eye began to emerge and rapid intensification ensued. ==Meteorological history== During March 3, 2018 the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) reported that Tropical Disturbance 09F had developed within a trough of low pressure about to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. At this time the disturbance had a broad low-level circulation and was located within a very favourable environment for further development, with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Over the next couple of days, the disturbance gradually developed further as it gradually moved westwards towards Vanuatu, under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure. It was subsequently classified as a tropical depression by the FMS during March 5, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system later that day. During March 6, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 12P, after its broad low-level circulation center had slowly consolidated and the overall organisation of the cyclone had improved. The FMS subsequently reported that the system had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Hola, while it was located about to the east of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu. After it was named, Hola started developing a weak low level eye feature, before it was classified as a category 2 tropical cyclone as it passed in between the islands of Pentecost and Ambrym. The system subsequently passed over the island of Malekula and moved into the Coral Sea during March 7, where it rapidly consolidated and developed a pinhole eye. The FMS subsequently reported that Gita had become a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone and predicted that Hola would peak as a Category 5 Severe Tropical Cyclone. However, during the following day Hola's eye weakened and became cloud filled, as it stalled to the west of Vanuatu. As a result, the FMS reported that the system had peaked as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). During March 8, the JTWC also reported that Hola had peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.https://blog.metservice.com/node/1179 ==Preparations and impact== Hola raged over Vanuatu as a Category 4 very severe tropical cyclone at 07:00am NZT, and killed one person and seriously injured another two as heavy rains and punishing winds lashed the region. Winds of up to 165 km/h (102 mph) and gusts of up to 230 km/h (143 mph) were reported. Multiple houses had suffered extensive damage and countless trees and crops had been uprooted. School classrooms were blown off their foundations in Ambrym but no injuries or deaths were reported. The school's principal claimed that 20 to 30 per cent of houses within the region would have been completely destroyed after feeling the full-force of Hola. Heavy rainfall, damaging winds and bursting river banks rattled the region. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/tropical- cyclone-hola-sets-sights-zealand-180311083055309.html https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/102041257/tropical-cyclone-hola- develops-near-vanuatu-impact-on-new-zealand-uncertain ==See also== *Cyclone Donna *Cyclone Bola ==References Category:2017–18 South Pacific cyclone season Category:Category 4 South Pacific cyclones Category:March 2018 events in Oceania Category:Tropical cyclones in Vanuatu Category:Tropical cyclones in New Caledonia Category:Tropical cyclones in New Zealand Category:2018 in Vanuatu Category:2018 in New Caledonia Category:2018 in New Zealand Hola ","title":"Cyclone Hola"},{"id":"56778067","text":"The Società anonima delle strade ferrate della Lombardia e dell'Italia Centrale was a joint-stock Anglo-French-Italian private company formed, following the partition of the territory, and the railways built in it, under construction or planned, resulting from the defeat of Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence, following the convention of 25 June 1860 among the Ministers of King Vittorio Emanuele II for Public Works and Finance and the previous Imperial-regia società privilegiata delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia Centrale. ==History== The complicated process leading to the birth of the company has its roots in the decade of 1850-1860. The agreement between the Ministers of Public Works and Finance of the Kingdom of Italy (newly established) on 25 June 1860 and approved by the Parliament of the Kingdom, consisting of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies on July 8, ratified, with the appropriate changes in the composition of the share capital, guarantees and representatives, the previous agreement that the previous imperial-privileged company had signed with the Austrian government on 14 March 1856 and with the Duchy of Parma, Duchy of Modena and Reggio, Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States three days later, on 17 March. The Second Italian War of Independence led to the splitting of the Lombardo-Veneto railway network and the complex economic interweaving of the construction and operation of the railways. ===The convention=== The construction of railways by the State became blocked in 1854, owing to the lack of available funds. A new law for concessions began the era of private railways. Much infrastructure was completed by private companies whose economic consistency was essentially based on Rothschild capital of the Viennese house, with not always quantifiable holdings of homologous Parisian and London houses. On 14 March 1856, a Convention concerning the recruitment, construction and operation of the railways in the Lombard-Veneto Kingdom was signed between the Imperial- Registers Ministers of Finance and Commerce of Austria and a consortium of financiers and bankers, including Rothschild of the Viennese, Parisian and English houses, Paulin Talabot and other Frenchmen, Pietro Bastogi, the Duke of Galliera and other Italian financiers. The convention provided for in Article 1 that the State gives to the said lords the Railway tracks of the State located in the Lombardy-Venetia Kingdom with all their appurtenances, movable and immovable, excepting only that trunk which, starting from Verona, enters towards the Southern Title, in order to exercise and use them for the duration of 90 years. Article 43 allowed the bankers consortium to establish a company with residence in Vienna and to issue shares. The document provided for the obligation to complete the construction works on the sections not yet completed. With the agreement, the company: * Acquired the Coccaglio-Venezia, Milano-Treviglio, Bergamo-Coccaglio, Milan-Como, Verona-Mantua and Mestre- Casarsa lines. * Undertook to build the Bergamo-Monza, Lecco-Bergamo, Milan- Boffalora, Milan-Piacenza, Milan-Sesto Calende, Mantova-Borgoforte and Casarsa-Udine-Nabresina lines. * Was given running powers over the line between Nabresina and Trieste belonging to the Austrian Southern Railway (still under construction). On 17 March 1856, the Convention between Austria, the Papal States, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Parma and Duchy of Modena and Reggio was signed, granting the Marquis Raffaele de Ferrari, Duke of Galliera, the concession for the construction of the \\"Italian Central Railway\\" consisting of Piacenza-Parma-Reggio and Mantova-Reggio-Bologna- Pistoia and Prato. The guarantee of a minimum annual total interest of 6,500,000 lire was also granted, due to the very serious difficulties in carrying out the work. The company adopted the name of Imperial-regia società privilegiata delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia Centrale as a result of this assignment. On May 24 of the same year, the concession already granted (16 June 1851) to the Società Anonima per la Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale regarding Pistoia-Bologna (and passed to the new company) was officially revoked. The banking groups consortium obtained further concessions, such as Vienna-Trieste and Innsbruck-Verona. On 1 January 1859 the fusion between the Lombard-Venetian and Central Italy companies and the Eastern railway company (KKP Kaiser Franz Joseph-Orientbahngesellschaft) was constituted as the Kaiserliche königliche privilegierte südliche Staats, Lombardisch-venezianische und Zentral-italienische Eisenbahngesellschaft with registered office in Vienna. After defeat in the war, and the loss of Lombardy, the Austrian government entrusted all the lines built or under construction in the territory remaining in its possession to the Südbahn (which was also majority-owned by Rothschild), subtracting them from the competence of Lombardy-Veneto (in which there was significant French and Italian capital). ===The old company comes back to life in the Kingdom of Italy=== The defeat of Austria in the second war of independence risked compromising the project and related investments. With the border moved from the Ticino to the Mincio, the future of the project was in doubt. Mediation was undertaken to arrive at a new convention with the Italian State. Paulin Talabot was the representative of the Rothschild bankers. The maneuvers of the Leghorn banking groups, headed by Pietro Bastogi, were no less important. Other subjects were also interested, including Bartolomeo Cini, the first financier of Porrettana, and the Duke of Galliera. The resolution taken by the Italian government was to free the company from previous obligations and any form of dependence on Vienna, reconstituting it with a new concession. This was based on the previous one, gave new rules by which the company had to abide, and listed the railway lines that would be entrusted to it. As for central Italy, the company became a concessionaire for the construction and operation of Piacenza-Bologna and the line for Pistoia. It lost the concession of Reggio-Borgoforte but, in exchange, it obtained the one for the Bologna- Ferrara-Pontelagoscuro line, including the bridge over the Po. In 1861 the company was registered in the official share price list of the Milan Stock Exchange. ===The SFAI takeover=== The following years were difficult and caused numerous disruptions. The law no. 2279 of 14 May 1865 led to the formation of three major railway companies: * Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (Upper Italian Railways, SFAI) * Società per le Strade Ferrate Romane (Roman Railways, SFR) * Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Company for the Southern Railways, SFM) The SFAI was established on 1 July 1865 with 1,057.5 miles (1,701.9 km) of line it acquired from the state railway of the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) (453.5 miles (729.8 km)), the part of the state railway of the former Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia (604 miles (972 km)) and some private railways, including the Victor Emmanuel Railway, and some of the Südbahn. All this constituted the network of Upper Italy and was added to what was already owned by the Lombard-central company up to Florence. Thus was born the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) whose members and financiers were practically the same as the previous company - a simple takeover with the acquisition of some additional lines. Into the coffers of the Kingdom came 188.42 million lire for the transfer of rolling stock and railway tracks to the newly established Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia. In return, it was given a 95-year concession. The Government also guaranteed the Company a gross product of 28 million lire for the entire network. On 1 July 1885 the SFAI network was taken over by the Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean Network) and the Rete Adriatica (Adriatic Network), with lines generally west of Milan going to the Rete Mediterranea. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * C.

The accident dealt a severe blow to the Rhodesian Security Forces, then fighting bitterly against ZANLA and ZIPRA insurgents in the Rhodesian Bush War, for the officers involved were some of its best and would prove difficult to replace. ==Accident== An Alouette III helicopter of the South African Air Force (SAAF) crewed by an SAAF pilot, Air Sub-Lieutenant Johannes van Rensberg, and a Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF) flight technician, Sergeant Pieter van Rensberg, was flying from Umtali to Melsetter with four senior Rhodesian Army officers as passengers. These were Major General John Shaw, Colonel David Parker, Captain John Lamb and Captain Ian Robinson. The Alouette III was one of several loaned to Rhodesia to assist in counter-insurgency operations during the Bush War. Flying at low altitude in accordance with procedure and en route to troops stationed on the border for a Christmas visit, the helicopter flew into a rusty, long-forgotten hawser cable at around 10 a.m. on Shinda Orchards Farm near Cashel, just south of Umtali and 3 km from the Mozambican border. The cable had years before been used to pass logs down a steep slope and was unmarked on any maps. The airframe began to break up as the helicopter spun out of control and crashed. All on board were killed except for the pilot, who was seriously injured, losing one of his legs. A combined funeral was held six days later, on 30 December, at St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral in Salisbury. A joint honour guard, unusual due to the rarity of four officers from four different regiments dying alongside one another, was provided by the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) and the Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR). It was the largest Security Forces funeral ever held in Rhodesia, with a huge officer contingent taking part in the funeral procession. Behind the honour guard and the men's families, the top brass – army commander Lieutenant General Peter Walls, Minister of Defence and Minister of Foreign Affairs P. K. van der Byl, Commissioner Peter Sherren of the British South Africa Police (BSAP), Air Marshal Mick McLaren of the RhAF and the South African military attaché, Brigadier L. L. Gordon – led this slow march. ==Impact== Shaw was the Rhodesian Army's Chief of Staff and thus second-in-command to Walls. Almost a month earlier, on 30 November, Parker had ended his tenure as commanding officer of the RLI whereupon he was promoted from Lieutenant-Colonel to the rank of Colonel. Robertson was the acting commanding officer of 5 Independent Company the Rhodesia Regiment, and Lamb served in the headquarters of 3 Brigade the RAR. The historians Hannes Wessels and P. J. H. Petter-Bowyer agree that the deaths of the Rhodesian officers, in particular the death of Parker, affected the course of the Bush War in the guerrillas' favour: Shaw was Rhodesia's \\"next Army Commander\\", says Petter- Bowyer, and Parker \\"its finest field commander\\". The Colonel was \\"earmarked for bigger things\\", Wessels writes, \\"... his loss was a considerable blow to the Rhodesian war effort.\\" Likewise, Peter Godwin and Ian Hancock describe Shaw as a \\"controversial figure within Army circles, disliked—by some—for his drinking and his manners\\" but nevertheless Walls' \\"probable successor\\". They go on to say \\"the loss of Parker and Lamb, on the other hand, was generally regarded as a grievous blow.\\" ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Rhodesia Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1975 Category:1975 in Rhodesia Category:Cold War military history of South Africa Category:Rhodesia–South Africa military relations Category:Accidents and incidents involving military aircraft Category:Accidents and incidents involving helicopters Category:December 1975 events in Africa ","title":"Cashel South African Air Force Alouette crash"},{"id":"56778139","text":"The Wallace's large spiny rat (Halmaheramys wallacei) is a rodent found on the Obi Islands of Bisa and Obi in the Molucca archipelago of Indonesia.

Berry, who served as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health and Medical Affairs from 1954–1961. The Plan, enacted in 1954, arose out of a proposed \\"Doctor's Draft,\\" originally met with objections from the American Medical Association, The Association of American Medical Colleges, and the American Hospital Association, who felt the draft would deprive them of a pool of young men who would staff their hospitals. The Berry Plan offered draftees three choices: entry into the Armed Forces after completing a medical internship, after completing one year of residency and returning to their residencies after completion of service, and after completion of a full residency program.

They were known as the reformists during Poland's de-Stalinisation process. The other group, dubbed Natolińczycy, was known as the hardliners. Puławianie united primarily party members of Jewish origin. The most prominent representatives of the Puławy faction were Roman Zambrowski, and Leon Kasman. The name comes from the chain of apartment buildings at Puławska 24 and 26 streets in Warsaw, which survived the war. These apartments were settled mainly by a very high communist party officials, in which some of the supporters of the Puławianie group lived. The opposed Polish clique within the communist party called them “the Jews.” Witold Jedlicki described the struggle between Natolins and the Pulawians in the booklet “Oafs and Jews”.

She moved to France as a young adult, founding the journal Echanges, which attempted to give British and French writers an audience for each other's work. She introduced writers such as W. H.

She remained there for the rest of her life, though she visited London frequently. She was friends with the poet Brian Howard. Harper later contributed useful anecdotes for Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster's biography of Brian Howard.

On 27 January 1883, an 885-ton German barque named Admiral Prinz Adalbert of Danzig was caught in a storm in Mumbles Head and wrecked just below the lighthouse. The Mumbles lifeboat came to rescue the crew. When the Mumbles lifeboat, a wooden sailboat named the Wolverhampton, got into trouble Wright and Ace waded into the surf to rescue the lifeboat crew. They tied their shawls together to use as a rope and rescued two of the lifeboat crewmen who had fallen overboard. It is reported that Wright cried: \\"I will lose my life than let these men drown\\" as she waded into the icy waters. While some claimed the story was apocryphal, their father confirmed the actions of his daughters, alongside those of Gunner Edward Hutchings, in rescuing two crew members from the ship during the inquest into the disaster. Four of the Wolverhampton crew died that night, leaving four widows and fourteen orphaned children. The same storm also wrecked two other ships (Agnes Jack and James Grey) on the Gower Peninsula, claiming 44 lives. ==Recognition== While the Royal National Lifeboat Institution awarded a silver medal and £50 to the coxswain who had aided the women in the rescue, and issued a commendation on vellum to Hutchings, it did not officially recognize the sisters' role. The sisters did receive gold brooches from Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the Empress of Germany, for caring for the barque's crew. The women gained international fame when they were featured on the front page illustration of The Graphic in February 1883. ==Legacy== Clement Scott wrote a poem, The Women of Mumbles Head, in tribute to their heroic actions. In 2016, a blue plaque was erected by Mumbles Pier to commemorate their bravery. ==Later years== In 1885, Jessie Ace married John Dunstan at St. Mary's, Swansea; the two emigrated to Australia in 1889.

He attended E.E. Smith High School. He was kicked out of his parents' home for being gay. == Career  Pageants === Parker started doing drag pageants in 1990, with her first being the Miss Gay USofA at Large 1990. She has won over 100 pageants, including Miss'd America 2013. === Film and television === Parker was in the documentary Trantasia, which debuted in 2006. In 2008, he appeared in the documentary film Pageant with Alyssa Edwards and other queens detailing their experience on Miss Gay America. In 2015, Parker made a minor appearance along with Chad Michaels in an episode of 2 Broke Girls. She was a backup dancer with 30 other drag queens for Miley Cyrus's 2015 VMA Awards performance. Parker was on the E! show Botched (Season 3, Episode 4) to fix the silicone problems with his nose, including a point where the skin was starting to decay.  RuPaul's Drag Race  Performing in 2017 Parker was announced as one of the nine contestants for the inaugural season of RuPaul's Drag Race on February 2, 2009. She has been described as the season's only older and plus-sized queen. Parker was eliminated during the first episode, becoming the very first contestant ever eliminated in the history of the show. She was sent home by Akashia. Because of this, RuPaul always addresses her with \\"Hey Porkchop\\" during all of the Drag Race live reunions, starting with season 4. Parker has been brought back on the show by RuPaul several times, in homage to being the first contestant ever eliminated. She appeared during the recap episode of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 2 and was featured in winning queen Alaska's rap. Parker was also brought back for the first episode of season 10 of RuPaul's Drag Race to help judge the mini-challenge. In 2019 she appeared as a guest for the first challenge in the premiere of season eleven of Drag Race posing with Soju. In the first episode of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 3, Vanessa Hudgens lip synced against \\"Porkchop\\", an actual pork chop, which RuPaul said was Parker. In March 2018, Variety said that Parker was one of the 10 most successful queens in their careers after the show. She has toured internationally. As of 2018, Parker was still publicly vying for a spot on RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars. Daniel Welsh of Huffington Post wrote \\"we're surprised contestants like Jessica Wild, Ongina and even Victoria \\"Porkchop\\" Parker are still sitting on the shelf, waiting to be plucked up for All Stars.\\" ==Personal life== Bowling was attacked at a gay bar which resulted in a gunshot wound and acid damage on his face, requiring surgery. He had silicone injections done by an unlicensed nurse in 1999, resulting in granuloma. He has been blocked by President Donald Trump on Twitter. ==FilmographyTelevision=== {  - ! Date !! Title !!

Cousins of his wife Erasme and José Lasarte Janer turned recognized Catalan artists, respectively a painter and a writer. It is not clear whether a well-known singer Julio Iglesias, who also originated from Orense, was his distant relative.Julio Iglesias' paternal grandfather, Ulpiano Iglesias Sarria (born in Orense in 1877), was a military and a pharmacist. No information on Iglesias Sarria's ancerstors is readily available ==Early public activity (before 1910)== Gaceta de Galicia editorial board, around 1904 (Iglesias not present) The young Dalmacio has early developed a penchant for letters and already in 1893 he contributed to local periodicals.the local Galician dailies that Iglesias contributed to were El Eco de Orense, La Voz Católica, El Derecho and La Nueva Epoca; the weekly was La Bruja; all this information has been provided by Iglesias himself, Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo- Americana, vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939 During his academic period he kept publishingEl Noroeste, La Gaceta de Galicia and El Pensamiento Gallego, Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana, vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939 and founded an ephemeral literary weekly Santiago. He practiced his oratory skills in Ateneo Escolar Compostelano, where he became first the secretary and then the president, and in Ateneo Leon XIII.Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana, vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939 Inclined towards literature, he used to read out his own poetryEl Eco de Santiago 10.12.97, available here, also El Eco de Santiago 09.12.01, available here and wrote prosaic pieces in Gallego,El Eco de Santiago 24.02.98, available here his works were flavored with militant religious zeal. In 1902 he took part in the Catholic Congress in Santiago and presented a paper at a section dedicated to religious orders.El Eco de Santiago 14.07.02, available here It was during the academic period when Iglesias was fascinated by the personality of Juan Vázquez de Mella and got attracted to Carlism.Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana, vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939 It seems that upon arrival in Catalonia Iglesias engaged in Carlist youth structures; in 1904 he was noted as giving lectures in Círculo Tradicionalista of BarcelonaEl Eco de Santiago 17.10.94, available here and in late 1905 he became vice-president of Juventud Tradicionalista in the city,El Tradicionalista 04.11.05, available here delivering addresses also elsewhere in Catalonia, e.g. in Gerona.El Norte 10.12.16, available here At the time the Catalan Carlists were more than ever prepared to swallow their skepticism about alliance with other anti-governmental parties, especially the regionalists from La Lliga; the strategy produced a broad electoral alliance known as Solidaridad Catalana. Iglesias spoke vehemently against this \\"hermandad vulgo pisto rabioso pactada\\"; his highly emotional harangues earned him attention of the Liberal and Republican press, as already in early 1906 he featured as a negative point of reference.La Lucha 02.03.06, available here Apart from his duties as a Ministry of Finance delegate Iglesias practiced also as a lawyer.El Tradicionalista 16.06.07, available here In 1908 he got involved in a controversial and widely discussed case known as \\"caso Rull\\". Rull was an undercover police operative who penetrated the world of Barcelona proletarian conspiracy but was himself charged with terrorism, perhaps related to some extreme party or organization.the explosives that Rull was associated with were planted in obscure and unfrequented passages apparently with little harm intended, which led some to suspect he was on service of an unidentified extreme party aiming at bringing police forces into disrepute, compare El Pais 09.04.08, available here, see also Eduardo González Calleja, La razón de la fuerza: orden público, subversión y violencia política en la España de la Restauración (1875–1917), Madrid 1998, , p. 401 Iglesias first represented some of the defendants in courtLa Correspondencia de España 26.03.08, available here and later defended Rull himself in an appeal case.El Bien Público 25.04.08, available here The two seemed to have developed sort of friendship yet the prosecutor had his way and Rull was eventually executed;Los Debates 10.08.08, available here during and after the affair Iglesias was widely quoted speaking on terrorism and related issues.La Correspondencia de Valencia 27.05.08, available here The Rull affair gained Iglesias a name in Barcelona, since in 1909 he emerged as expert on \\"antrolopología criminal\\".La Bandera Regional' 27.11.09, available here Semana Tragica, Barcelona 1909 Once the city was rocked by riots known as Semana Trágica Iglesias voiced against \\"doctrinas positivistas\\" and secular teaching, identified as primary roots of urban unrest.La Bandera Ragional 27.11.09, available here In 1909 and in response to left-wing violence Iglesias engaged in Catholic social actionEl Social 03.04.09, available here and was among the founders of Carlism-related Comité de Defensa Social,Las Provincias 26.11.09, available here an hybrid organisation with characteristics of a cultural centre, a mutual help organization, a militia and a trade union.

Historia de una ambición política, Madrid 2000, , p. 134 he ran in the Cortes elections from Gerona in 1910; riding the wave of anti-Left backlash which followed The Tragic Week he somewhat unexpectedly emerged triumphant.in 1910 Iglesias received 2,957 votes out of 8,653 votes cast and 11,344 voters entitled, compare the official Cortes service, available here Iglesias defeated a Republican Eduardo Fernández del Pozo and liberals, Jaime Roura and Pablo Bosch y Barrau ==Political climax (1910-1914)== Catalan requetés, 1910s The 1910–1914 Cortes service proved the period of Iglesias' hectic if not frenetic activity, especially during the first two years of his tenure.between June and December of 1910 Iglesias was noted at least 750 times in the press. In 1911 he was mentioned around 600 times, in 1912 around 450 times, in 1913 around 170 times and in 1914 around 110 times, compare prensahistorica service, available here, and hemerotecadigital service, available here Though he focused also on topics like the armyDiario de Tortosa 27.10.10, available here and economyLa Tarde 30.11.10, available here he was mostly bent on confronting the Radicals of Lerroux, whom he presented as a threat not only to public order but also to the entire civilization.e.g. in July 1910 Iglesias demanded that all lerrouxista centres in Barcelona are closed as threat to public order, La Defensa 04.07.10, available here, and blamed the lerrouxistas fpr Semana Trágica, El Noticiero 07.07.10, available here. Many times he clashed with Radicals in the Cortes, compare Las Provincias 07.07.10, available here, including oral skirmishes with Lerroux himself, El Eco de Navarra 08.06.11, available here His own rhetoric was inflammatory; Canalejas noted that in his counter-revolutionary zeal he was carried away by hysteria.Canalejas noted Iglesias' promise that he would \\"iba a matar la hidra revolucionaria con la punta de su espada\\", La Juventud 03.09.10, available here. In revenge Iglesias denounced Canalejas as a masonic tool of the English, El Clamor 08.04.11, available here. His claims about the English and the freemasonry made some impact in the Vatican diplomacy, Ramon Corts i Blay, La Setmana Tràgica de 1909: l'Arxiu Secret Vaticà, Montserrat 2009, , p. 156 Though member of the diet, Iglesias emerged as leader of right-wing Catalan obrerismo, a working class violent anti-establishment movement.it is not clear how Iglesias' militant obrerismo translated into his parliamentary activity. In 1912 he proposed a draft law on \\"passive classes\\", yet no details are available, compare La Atalaya 09.03.12, available here. He was also in favor of regulations which legitimized strike action, La Región Cantabra 26.10.12, available here Confronting both radical lerrouxistas and bourgeoisie La Lliga, Iglesias started to champion what looked like a nascent Christian, urban, aggressive, proletariant protest crusade.Iglesias is considered \\"clearest example\\" of the fact that radical Carlists \\"dropped their usual conterrevolutionary guise, revealing a Carlist potential to evolve toward eplicitly right revolutionary positions\\", Colin. M. Winston, Carlist workers groups in Catalonia, 1900-1923, [in:] Stanley G. Payne (ed.), Identidad y nacionalismo en la España contemporánea: el carlismo, 1833-1975, Madrid 2001, , p. 91 His zeal to do away with the regime would soon lead him to advancing theories of Carlists and republicans joining ranks to topple the Restoration system,El Progreso 09.12.12, available here quickly quashed by the party hierarchyCollin Winston, The Proletarian Carlist Road to Fascism: Sindicalismo Libre, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 17 (1982), p. 561 and rejected by the Republicans.El Progreso 09.12.12, available here Iglesias's name soon became tantamount to an explosive conflict. Due to violent language employed and logic which instigated rebellion his press articles gave rise to many official enquiries.see e.g. El Radical 26.06.10, available here, Las Provincias 04.01.12, available here, El Grano de Arena 03.02.12, available here, El Cantabrico 23.02.13, available here, Las Provincias 06.11.13, available here In the early 1910s he managed himself two weeklies: La Voz de la TradiciónJosé Navarro Cabanes, Apuntes bibliográficos de la prensa carlista, Valencia 1917, pp. 252-253 and La Trinchera;La Correspondencia de Valencia 13.05.13, available here especially the latter emerged as the chief platform of violent obrerista propagandaWinston 2001, p. 88 which indulged in \\"fantasies of civil war in which Carlism triumphed\\".Winston 2001, p. 90 Police prevented sale of his discoursesEl Salmantino 03.08.10, availavle here and he was among the most investigated MPs, by far surpassing the first ever socialist MP in the Spanish parliament, Pablo Iglesias.in 1912 he was the 5th most interrogated deputy in the Cortes, with 46 cases against him, La Información 28.02.12, available here Almost every second rally Iglesias attended ended up in riots, usually between the Carlist requetés and the Radical Jovenes Barbaros.some of his pamphlets might have triggered violence, compare La Correspondencia de España 03.08.10, available here. Clashes were not limited to Catalonia, as they occurred even when he did show up in his native Orense, El Progreso 26.10.10, available here. Some incidents were clearly provoked by Iglesias, e.g. when leading a group of requetés he used to interrupt movie showings or assaulted orchestra playing La Marseillaise, El Adelanto 26.05.11, available here; 1911 his Blona meeting and discourse on pornography ended up – as usual – in skirmishes, El Cantábrico 22.05.11, available here. As a result, the lerrouxistas awaited him to stage their own provocations, La Correspondencia de Alicante 02.10.11, available here. The list of clashes, skirmishes or riots related to him as listed in the press would cover tens of incidents Even his expected attendance might have led to violent clashes, e.g. with two dead left in Eibar.El Noticiero 08.04.12, available here He was a few times assaulted.e.g. in Caraselva Iglesias was assaulted on the street, see El Salmantino 21.09.10, available here. In 1911 a train he was travelling at was shoot at, or at least it was believed so, El Noroeste 13.09.11, available here However, the most deadly turned out to be a 1911 urban battle in Sant Feliu de Llobregat; following his address at a Carlist rally hundreds of requetés and lerrouxistas engaged in a melee which left 6 people killed,El Restaurador 02.06.11, available here the incident investigated later in the parliament. It is with his personal contribution that \\"from 1911 to 1916 scuffling and occasional shoot-outs between Carlist and Radical youth were an accepted part of the Barcelona scene\\",Winston 1982, p. 560, Winston 2001, p. 90 especially that in 1913 he hailed \\"the club and the browning, the two indispensable companions of Jaimist youth\\".Winston 1982, pp. 560, 561. Iglesias intended to build requeté as shock troops used in a revolutionary insurgence which was expected to topple the republic, González Calleja 1998, p. 494 Sant Feliu clashes, 1911 Iglesias' radicalism estranged the Catalan Carlist leadership and the regional party jefe Duque de Solferino a few times tried to mitigate him;Eduardo González Calleja, Paramilitarització i violencia politica a l'Espanya del primer terc de segle: el requeté tradicionalista (1900-1936), [in:] Revista de Girona 37 (1991), p. 70 despite being Gerona MP Iglesias did not head the provincial Gerona organisation.the provincial Carlist Gerona jefe was José María Vilahur, Albert Balcells, Joan B. Culla, Conxita Mir, Les eleccions generals a Catalunya de 1901 a 1923, Barcelona 1982, p. 222 Iglesias himself started to dream of old-fashioned party leaders killed in a civil war and making room for the youth.Winston 2001, p. 90 However, in 1912 he entered the national Carlist executiveAgustín Fernández Escudero, El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2012, p. 458 and also in 1912 in Biarritz he met his king for the first time.Diario de Córdoba 10.05.12, available here. He claimed he had not known Don Jaime before, see El Porvenir 02.07.12, available here, though one year earlier, in September 1911, he had been reported as departing to Frohsdor to speak with Don Jaime on organization of Carlism, La Atalaya 24.09.11, available here. Iglesias' stand versus Don Jaime is not clear. On the one hand it does not seem marked by particular loyalty; upon his 1910 election he refused to send a customary Carlist telegram message of adhesion and claimed he had to wait for approval from Comité de Defensa Social, La Correspondencia de España 14.04.10, available here. On the other hand, in June 1912 Iglesias felt competent to discuss Don Jaime's private issues and declare that he would soon marry a foregin princess, La Atalaya 01.06.12, available here He did not seem engaged in struggle for power within the party top echelons and is not listed as protagonist of a raging conflict between his old-time master Vázquez de Mella and the official party leader, Bartolomé Feliu.the most detailed work on Carlist history at the turn of the centuries, Fernández Escudero 2012, barely mentions Iglesias. A work on Mellismo does not mention Iglesias prior to the Great War period, see Andres Martin 2000 ==On the verge of loyalty (1914-1919)== Carlist standard In the 1914 electoral campaign Iglesias stood as a Carlist candidate in Geronain 1910 a Republican daily claimed that Gerona was \\"feudo de don Dalmacio Iglesias\\" and agonised about his inquisitorial methods against the Liberals, El Pueblo 21.07.10, available here, but given his 1914 defeat the claims seem exaggerated or outdated and though proportionally he was more successful than 4 years earlier, ultimately he failed to renew his deputy ticket.in 1910 Iglesias gained 2.957 votes (34,15% of voters and 26,06% of those entitled to vote). In 1914 he gained 2,954 votes (respectively 36,31% and 26,5%) and lost to a Republican contender, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, pp. 546, 534 It would soon turn out that he failed in his later bids – also from Gerona - of 1916in 1916 Iglesias gained 2,465 votes (29,81% of the voters and 21,39% of the electorate) and lost to a Republican contender, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 559 and 1918.in 1918 Iglesias gained 2,241 votes (25,98% of the voters and 19,26% of the electorate) and lost to a Lliguero contende, Balcells, Culla, Mir 1982, p. 570 Iglesias acknowledged defeat, resumed his suspended duties as Hacienda delegate and re-opened the law office in Barcelona.Heraldo de Gerona 15.06.14, available here. He was member of colegios in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona, Heraldo Alaves 01.12.17, available here Always skeptical about courting La Lliga, in the mid-1910s Iglesias started to lead an anti- Catalanist group within the local party. Though he declared himself a regionalist and even in favor of autonomy,El Porvenir 07.06.12, available here by scholars he is considered a champion of anti-regionalist españolismo;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 134 opponent of the new Catalan Carlist leader Miguel Junyentin January 1915 Iglesias was still recorded as speaking with Junyent during the same rally, El Porvenir 14.01.15, available here and his daily El Correo Catalan, Iglesias openly challenged his line of seeking understanding with the Catalanists. The rift became clear when in 1915 he founded El Legitimista Catalan;La Correponsencia de España 02.05.15, available here the national party jefe Cerralbo disauthorised the paperLa Correpospondencia de Valencia 12.06.15, available here, Montejurra 50 (1970), p. VIII and threatened these taking part in a related meeting with expulsion;El Cantabrico 13.06.15, available here the meeting took place and invariably ended in riots,La Correspondencia de Valencia 13.06.15, available here but the weekly was eventually closed after just 3 months.El Legitimista was issued between October 1915 and December 1915, Jaime del Burgo, Bibliografia del Siglo XIX, Pamplona 1978, , p. 570 Iglesias found himself on the verge of loyalty to the party, yet Cerralboperhaps influenced by de Mella, as some scholars suggest that during his second tenure de Cerralbo was a front-man with de Mella actually running the party, compare Fernández Escudero 2012 preferred not to escalate the conflict; in 1916 he confirmed Iglesias as the party candidate from Gerona,El Cantabrico 26.03.16, available here which in turn triggered protest resignation of the local Carlist Junta Provincial.Conxita Mir, Lleida (1890-1936): caciquisme polític i lluita electoral, Montserrat 1985, , p. 311 Iglesias kept lambasting a policy which according to him melted Carlism in a broad Catalanism;El Debate 28.03.64, available here upon the 1917 emergence of Parliamentary Assemblythe Assembly was attended by some fellow Gerona Carlists like Pedro Llosas Badía he strongly voiced against the initiativeEl Adelanto 02.08.17, available here as giving in to the likes of Lerroux and Cambó.El Porvenir 09.08.17, available here There were two other threads which rendered Iglesias a key protagonist of internal conflict in regional Carlism. One was his continued penchant for social radicalism; he remained active in Comité de Defensa Social and even built its militia,La Esquella de la Torratxa 03.03.16, available here. In early 1919 Iglesias was Inspector General de Requeté de Catalunya, El Norte 07.02.19, available here apart from reverting to a theory that the Carlists should close ranks with \\"extrema izquierda\\" in order to do away with the corrupted regime.El Gironés 15.04.16, available here Another conflictive issue was the Great War. While the party officially supported neutrality most Catalan Carlists harbored francophone feelings; Iglesias emerged as leader of the local pro-German faction, noted for his cries of viva AlemaniaEl Noroeste 02.08.15, available here and even for declaration that he was prepared to shed blood if the time comes.La Correspondencia de España 27.06.15, available here; the English have been traditionally considered the enemies of Spain and other nations, compare here It remains paradoxical that despite his extremely conflictive personality Iglesias remained on at least formally correct terms with other party leaders; in 1917 together with Junyent he entered Comité de Acción Política of the Catalan Carlism,contrary to usual opinions of Iglesias as anti-Catalanist españolista, he supported the concept that internal Carlist Catalan documents be written in Catalan, El Norte 30.12.17, available here a new body of somewhat unclear role.in early 1918 the Comité personal setup seems to have changed; Solferino and Junyent disappeared, while Teodoro Más emerged as president and Iglesias is secretary, which might be indicative of the body taken over by the Mellistas, El Norte 05.01.18, available here It seems even more surprising that following defeat in 1918 elections Iglesias managed to ensure support of conservative parties when competing for seat in the Senate from Tarragona; it seems that he owed successLa Cruz 12.03.18, available here to Maura and his ruling faction rather than to his own party.it seems that Iglesias got was running for senate as the official governmental candidate, Isidre Molas, Els senadors carlins de Catalunya, Barcelona 2009, p. 17 During a short term between mid-1918 and mid-1919 he basked in prestige of a senator and contributed to a few legal solutions adopted, e.g. to the law on civil servants.Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana, vol. 28, part I, Madrid 1925, p. 939 ==In search of a new political identity (1919-1923)== Don Jaime, around 1919 Conflict between the key party theorist Vázquez de Mella and the claimant Don Jaime, the strife which was tearing Carlism apart since the late 1900s, came to an abrupt end in early 1919: the Mellistas broke away to build their own party. Iglesias has always remained fascinated with de Mella yet he did not count among his partisans in course of internal conflict;compare Fernandez Escudero 2012, Andres Martin 2000 it was only during the Great War that he emerged as key Catalan Mellista. In February 1919 he was expulsed from Comunión TradicionalistaEl Cantábrico 04.02.19, available here and immediately engaged in work to built a new Mellista organization. After Teodoro Más, leader of the Catalan secessionists,La Opinión 28.09.19, available here Iglesias was the most prominent exponent of the breakaways in the region and some count him among the most prominent secessionists also nationwide;in 1919 he was considered one of key promellistas with Pradera, Garcia Guijarro, Chicharro, Careaga and Doña Marina; in February 1919 they united in senate and declared themselves anti-Jaimistas, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 147 some authors name him a leader of \\"dalmacistas\\", one of a few mostly personalist factions allegedly making up the Mellista group.according to a Jaimista author in early 1919 the Mellistas were nothing but a bunch of personalist following groups like \\"doñamarinistas, dalmacistas, o chicharristas\\", Andrés Martín 2000, p. 162. However other authors suggest that at this point Iglesias parted ways with the radical Barcelona Carlists. Though earlier he was their most recognizable personality, in 1919 most of them remained loyal to Don Jaime, Colin Winston, Workers and the Right in Spain, Princeton 2014, , pp. 157-158 Upon expiration of the senator mandate in May 1919 Iglesias for the 5th time tried to obtain the deputy ticket from Gerona and for the 4th time failed;when running from Gerona Iglesias got 2241 votes, El Norte 13.05.18, available here, which amounts to 31,6% of the voters and 20,0% of the electorate, see the official Cortes service here initially reported to run for a consolation prize in the senate from TarragonaEl Restaurador 10.05.19, available here he eventually withdrew.El Eco de la Comarca 22.06.19, available here He contributed to local efforts of forging a new party within a grand right-wing coalition and specified his program as \\"religión, unidad de la Patria española, Orden social y Monarquía tradicional y, por tanto, regionalista\\";Andrés Martín 2000, p. 172, ABC 18.05.19 indeed he supported the autonomous statute drafted by Mancomunitat.Albert Balcells, El projecte d'autonomia de la Mancomunitat de Catalunya del 1919 i el seu context històric, Barcelona 2010, p. 94. In 1919 in front of Mancomunitat Iglesias defended the right of castellano-speaking children to education in castellano, Balcells 2010, p. 245 During a grand assembly of Catalan Mellistas in Badalona of 1920 he hoped they would serve as agglutinatory factor for all Catholic forces,Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 197-198 yet such a union was slow to materialize: in 1921 he was denied the Maurista support during one more bid for the senate.during the 1921 electoral campaign Iglesias was reportedly denied supported of the Mauristas, which he considered treason, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 213 As usual his appearances led to unrest, though in 1921 his rally was interrupted by his former darlings requetés, who shouted \\"viva Jaime Tercero\\".El Noticiero Gaditano 04.06.21, available here Mellista meeting, Barcelona 1921 In mid-1922 Iglesias was still reported as heart and soul of the new emerging Mellista party and seemed prepared to go to great lengths when seeking allies, most likely the Integrists; he admitted that having broken all ties with Don Jaime, he was prepared to recognize Don Alfonso as a legitimate king given he swears allegiance to the Traditionalist principles.El Debate 19.06.22, available here, Andres Martin 2000, p. 230 However, at some point he apparently lost any hope about the Mellista project. Tempted by Partido Social Popular of Salvador Minguijón and other breakaway Carlists, he considered it a would-be embodiment of \\"sumarse al partido católico\\" plan.Andrés Martín 2000, p. 233 Eventually he neared an initiative to launch a non-dynastical monarchist party, though still remained cautious that the Traditionalists should not lose their own identity.

It was published on 31 May 2018. ==Plot== A prequel to the events of Casino Royale, the book recounts Bond's first mission as a double-0 agent, his status recently earned by killing a wartime traitor in Stockholm. Set in the French Riviera in 1950, Bond investigates the killing of the previous man designated 007 and resumes his final mission: determine what is behind the sudden lack of drug activity in the Corsican underworld. He develops his affinity for high-stakes casinos and fine hotels, where he meets Joanne \\"Sixtine / Madame 16\\" Brochet, a former British operative who leads him to Corsica mob boss Jean-Paul Scipio. Everything appears to point to the morbidly obese Scipio, head of a chemical company that serves as a front for his heroin business, but Bond discovers a larger network of organised crime and an American multi-millionaire named Irwin Wolfe. ==Background== Following the success of Horowitz's first Bond novel, Trigger Mortis, the author and the Fleming estate were both eager to begin work on another. The book was officially announced in October 2016 with a planned Spring 2018 release. It was also announced that the novel would be published by Jonathan Cape, the publisher of Fleming's originals. Like Trigger Mortis, which featured a story by Fleming based on previously unpublished material for the unmade James Bond television series, Horowitz would incorporate unused Fleming material in the new story. In February 2018 the title was revealed as Forever and a Day, and it was announced the story would be a prequel to Casino Royale, Fleming's first Bond novel. Fleming's material serves as a story Bond tells Sixtine about a previous escapade he had at the casino where they met. Horowitz auctioned off a chance to appear in the novel at an auction to support The Old Vic. Reade Griffith was the winning bidder and appears as an American CIA agent in the story. But Joann McPike also made a large donation and was an inspiration for Joanne \\"Sixtine / Madame 16\\" Brochet; \\"brochet\\" being the French word for \\"pike\\". ==Critical reception== Steven Poole of The Guardian noted that, contrary to Fleming's choice not to focus on backstory and to deal with Bond as a \\"fully formed force of nature\\", Horowitz is \\"taking a risk in writing\\" the novel set before Casino Royale. He labelled the book \\"Bond Begins\\", a reference to the previously untold origins of Batman in the 2005 Christopher Nolan film Batman Begins, something to which the 2006 film adaptation of Casino Royale was frequently compared. Though he criticised the way some of the classic Bond tropes are introduced in the story, Poole found the book to be \\"an enjoyably compact thriller, with an absolutely killer last line\\". Publishers Weekly called the book \\"entertaining\\" while noting that Horowitz \\"delivers a conclusion whose moral complexity will surprise anyone expecting an ending more in line with Fleming's own\\". Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"crisp, unpretentious, and bound to please\\" fans of the character, but noted that while Horowitz hits all obligatory notes, there's \\"nothing here that would make the unwary suspect how fiendishly inventive Horowitz can be when he's not laboring in Bond's shadow\\". ==References== Category:2018 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by Anthony Horowitz Category:Cold War spy novels Category:Fiction set in 1950 Category:Novels set in the 1950s ","title":"Forever and a Day (novel)"},{"id":"56778676","text":"Mahella is a genus in the phylum Firmicutes (Bacteria).

First founded in 1983 by Bahman Mehabadi in Tabriz, Iran, it was moved to Tehran, Iran, after several years of activity. Today it is home to SOL Philharmonic and SOL Music Educational Institute. SOL Philharmonic itself is organized into SOL Music Research and SOL Music Ensemble. SOL Music has performed in many concerts, published 17 Classical Music Albums, and presented over 100 issued articles about art and music. == SOL Philharmonic  SOL Music Ensemble ===  1996 - 1999  SOL Music Ensemble, founded in 1996 by Bahman Mehabadi, dedicated its continuous activity to performing Classical Music. Bahman Mehabadi, who was a full-time violinist of the Tehran Symphonic Orchestra at the time , invited Mohammad Reza Sharifi, another violinist of the Tehran Symphonic Orchestra, and Susan Zandi, cellist and a graduate of the Tehran Conservatory of Music. So, Sol Music Ensemble was formed as a trio. They published their first album in 1997 (“Summer”) by Iran Seda publishing company and had their first performance in Niavaran Cultural Center. The trio continued its work and published two more albums in the next two years; “Fall” (1998, by Iran Seda publishing company) and “Winter” (1999, by Hamavaz Ahang publishing company). The trio performed mostly Baroque music and a few Modern pieces, all recorded live in their three albums.  2000 - 2004  Two members left Sol Music Ensemble and Mehabadi invited two students of SOL Music Educational Institute (Houman Behzadi & Pouria Keshavarz) to join the Ensemble and to form a violin trio. They performed and recorded SOL’s 4th album (“Gaiety”) in 2000 (by Hamavaz Ahang publishing company). Gaiety's cover was designed by Hida Behzadi using the picture of a painting by Bahman Mehabadi. In these years, the Ensemble's public relations was voluntarily and actively done by Homa Sadr Arhami, a music lover who always devotedly supported SOL Music Ensemble with her activities. Soon Houman Behzadi left the Ensemble to continue his music studies in the University of Western Ontario. So two other students of SOL Music Educational Institute (Nahid Abtahi (guitar) and Hooman Akhtari (violin)) were invited and the Ensemble’s form was changed to three violins and a guitar. Nahid Abtahi, during the years of her presence in SOL Music, also took the role of designing covers for all the albums in which she played, often using the paintings of Bahman Mehabadi. Meanwhile, Mehabadi decided to establish SOL publishing company in order to publish its own albums . Ensemble, with its new members, performed in many occasions . Such as programs for Universities Music Festival , for Mahak Charity's benefit , and for Pajoohesh Week in Tehran University and published two other albums in 2003. “Benedictus” and “Creation” were the first albums published by SOL publishing company. SOL Music Ensemble donated part of the Benedictus sales to the earthquake victims of Bam in December 2003 . The 7th album (“Miniature”) consisted of several pieces of Azerbaijan Music . In December 2004, SOL Music Ensemble performed impressively in Craiova Centenar Music Festival (Romania) which made them more popular and more respected. They performed the program in Tehran’s Farhang Hall (Fajr Festival) too and recorded it as their next album (“Laudation”) .  2005 - 2008  In order to extend the Ensemble, two new members were invited to join the group: Amar Dadizadeh (violin) and Zohreh HassanNia (piano). Afshin Fatoorechi was one of the supportive people always giving his thoughtful advice for SOL Music's extension as an independent center. To celebrate “Mozart 250th Anniversary”, SOL Music Ensemble fully dedicated its 9th album to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Henry Purcell works. In 2007 it was published as “Empyrean” . After recording the 10th album (“Song of Peace”), Amar Dadizadeh, Zohreh HassanNia, and Hooman Akhtari left the Ensemble to continue their studies. \\"Song of Peace\\" was published in 2009 and was dedicated to Professor Zaven Yedigharians (Father to SOL Music Ensemble, the first teacher of Bahman Mehabadi, and the teacher of many other great Iranian Violinists) . Meanwhile, many concerts were performed by SOL Music Ensemble in different places in Tehran, such as in Germany Cultural Center, in Niavaran Cultural Center for the first Festival of Artistic Production, and in Vahdat Hall , and in a few Europe tours In January 2006, SOL publishing company participated in 40th Midem Music Exhibition, Cannes, France . Later, Nahal Mohebbi (violin) replaced Nahid Abtahi (guitar) to change the form of the Ensemble to violin trio one more time. The trio held a performance in Tabriz Cultural Center , being honored to have Professor Zaven Yedigharians in the audience.  2009 - 2018  Still wishing to extend the Ensemble, Mehabadi invited new members: Arghavan Sabahi (viola), Sara Abdollahzadeh (piano), Paranshid Shokoohi (piano), and Siamak Soltanalizadeh (viola). Maryam Tajik, Babak Nazari and Shahab Abtahi were also supportively present alongside other members. At this time, SOL Music Ensemble held seasonal concerts in its own place . They published new albums such as: “The Beyond” (Bahman Mehabadi, Pouria Keshavarz, Arghavan Sabahi and Sara Abdollahzadeh) in 2010 , “The Apple” (Bahman Mehabadi, Nahal Mohebbi and Sara Abdollahzadeh) in 2011 , “The Strawberry” (Bahman Mehabadi, Pouria Keshavarz, Arghavan Sabahi and Paranshid Shokoohi) in 2012 , “Bloom of Colors” (Bahman Mehabadi, Nahal Mohebbi and Sara Abdollahzadeh) in 2013 , “Aura” (Bahman Mehabadi, Nahal Mohebbi, Arghavan Sabahi, Siamak Soltanalizadeh, Sara Abdollahzadeh and Paranshid Shokoohi, by SOL Music in Germany) in 2015 , and “Liebesleid” (Bahman Mehabadi and Paranshid Shokoohi, by SOL Music in Germany) in 2018. Except two albums (“The Beyond” and “The Apple\\") whose covers were designed by Maryam Abtahi, the design of all the next album covers was done by Bahman Mehabadi and performed by Shahab Abtahi and Siamak Soltanalizadeh. Since 2012, with growing popularity, they have performed regular concerts in Iran House of Music , the Institute of Art and Culture , and Iranian Artists Forum’s Shahnaz Hall . Along the regular activities of the Ensemble, Bahman Mehabadi’s live performance of Bach Sonatas and Partitas was decided to be published by SOL Music in Germany.

He was the youngest of six children born to Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (1817–1885) and Matilda Elizabeth Griswold (1817–1889). His father was a lawyer who served as a U.S. Senator and later as Secretary of State under President Chester A. Arthur. His siblings included: Matilda Griswold Frelinghuysen, who married Henry Winthrop Gray, a prominent merchant; Charlotte Louisa Frelinghuysen; Frederick Frelinghuysen, who married Estelle B. Kinney; George Griswold Frelinghuysen, who married Sara Linen Ballantine, granddaughter of Peter Ballantine; and Sarah Helen Frelinghuysen (1856–1939), who married Judge John Davis, and after his death, Brig. Gen. Charles Laurie McCawley. His paternal grandparents were Frederick Frelinghuysen and Mary (née Dumont) Frelinghuysen. His grandfather died when his father was just three years old, so his father was adopted by his uncle, Theodore Frelinghuysen. Both grandfather and adopted grandfather were sons of Frederick Frelinghuysen, the eminent lawyer who was one of the framers of the first New Jersey Constitution, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, a member of the Continental Congress, and a member of the United States Senate. His maternal grandfather George Griswold, was a merchant in New York City who \\"made an immense fortune in the time of the clipper trade with China.\\" ==Career== Frelinghuysen was the Treasurer of the J. & P. Coats Ltd., a large British thread company that was run by his father-in-law Sir James Coats and located at 347 Broadway in New York City. Upon his marriage in 1885 to Alice Coats, his mother and father-in-law wanted him to be brought into Auchincloss Brothers as an equal partner. The American firm was run by the younger brothers of Alice's mother, John Winthrop Auchincloss and Hugh Dudley Auchincloss Sr. (the father of Hugh Auchincloss). When they said no, their refusal ended the Auchincloss relationship with the Coats firm and nearly bankrupt John. In 1906, he became a director as well as financier of the Brunswick Refrigeration Co., a consolidation of the New Brunswick Refrigeration Company and Union Refrigeration Company which had merged. The other directors included W. Campbell Clark, head of Clark Thread Company and A. M. Coats, president of the Coats Thread Company. Frelinghuysen retired from business in 1910. ===Society life=== In 1892, was Frelinghuysen included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Frelinghuysen was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Knickerbocker Club, the Union Club of the City of New York, the Harvard Club of New York, the Merchants' Club, the Country Club, the Lawyers' Club and the Suburban Riding and Driving Club. He was also a philanthropist who donated to the Floating Hospital and Seaside Hospital Fund in 1897. ==Personal life== On August 25, 1885, Frelinghuysen was married to Alice Dudley Coats (1861–1889) in Newport, Rhode Island. Alice was the daughter of Sir James Coats, 1st Baronet and Lady Sarah Auchincloss, an American. The wedding was attended by former President Chester Arthur. Her brothers included Sir Stuart Coats, 2nd Baronet, and Alfred Mainwaring Coats (1869–1942), who married Elizabeth Barnewall (1867–1940) (niece of Louisa Barnewall Van Rensselaer). They lived at 25 West 15th Street near Stuyvesant Square. Together, Theodore and Alice were the parents of: * Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (1886–1967), who married Mai Duncan Watson (1896–1958) in 1914. After their divorce, he married Katherine (née Kendall) Fisk (1883–1962), the widow of Charles W. Fisk, in 1927. * James Coats Frelinghuysen (1888–1890), who died young. After Alice's death in 1889, he married Elizabeth Mary \\"Lily\\" (née Thompson) Cannon (1871–1967), the widow of Henry Le Grand Cannon, on June 2, 1898 at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City by Bishop Henry C. Potter. At the wedding, his ushers were R. Livingston Beeckman and William Cutting Jr. and his best-man was Elisha Dyer Jr. Lily was a daughter of William G. Thompson and descendant of Elijah Brush, both Mayors of Detroit and had two children, a boy and girl, from her first marriage. After their marriage, they lived at her home, 60 Fifth Avenue and maintained a winter residence in Palm Beach, Florida known as \\"Southways,\\" and another house at Tuxedo Park, New York. Frelinghuysen died of heart disease on January 30, 1928 at his residence, 66 East 55th Street in Manhattan. Previous to East 55th Street, he had been living at the Hotel Plaza in New York. His widow lived at their Palm Beach home until her death in 1967, at the age of 97, when she was referred to as \\"a grand dame of a bygone era.\\" ===Descendants=== Through his son Frederick, he was the step-grandfather of Lilla Fisk, who married Harry Payne Bingham Jr. and George C. Rand in 1956; and Felicia Fisk, who married Albert B. Dewey, the brother of U.S. Representative Charles S. Dewey. ==References== Notes Sources Category:1860 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Frelinghuysen family Category:People included in New York Society's Four Hundred ","title":"Theodore Frelinghuysen (New York)"},{"id":"56778715","text":"Mangrovibacter is a genus in the phylum Proteobacteria (Bacteria).

An indenofluorene (IF) is any of five hydrocarbons with formula , whose carbon skeleton is a sequence of five fused rings with 6, 5, 6, 5, and 6 carbon atoms; an arrangement that can be described as the fusion of an indene core and a fluorene core (hence the common name).\\"Indenofluorene\\" entry at the PUBchem database. Accessed on 2020-08-28. The five structural isomers (regioisomers) differ in the way the rings are connected. They have unique properties, applications, and research interests. The name \\"indenofluorene\\" is also commonly used for any derivative of those five compounds (which are then specifically called \\"parent\\" or \\"unsubstituted\\" IFs), conceptually obtained by substituting other functional groups for some hydrogen atoms, and/or by hydrogenating the methylidene bridges (thus turning them into methylene bridges). Most IF synthesis and research work is done on these derivatives ==History== Despite being first synthesized in the late 19th century by Dr. S. Gabriel when he synthesized the substituted indeno [1,2-a] fluorene (shown right), the lack of robust synthesis routes left this family of molecules unexplored until the mid 20th century. After Gabriel, the next major step was the synthesis of the indeno [2,1-a] fluorene in 1939 by Weizmann et al. Next major advances came from Chardonens and Ritter with the synthesis the indeno [1,2-b] fluorene and indeno [2,1-b] fluorene in 1951. Continuing with their work, Chardonens and Ritter, synthesized indeno [1,2-a] fluorene in 1955. The final regioisomer, the indeno [2,1-c] fluorene was synthesized in 1961 by Ginsburg and Altman. Since the fifties and sixties, when these molecules were first being synthesized and discovered, improved synthetic routes and instrumentation have allowed IFs to be explored for uses in organic electronics including organic photovoltaics, organic light emitting diodes, and organic field effect transistors. Even with these advancements, the properties of IFs have remained largely unexplored. This is likely to change, however, as improvements on synthesis and expansion of IF examples continues to be an active area of research. ==Structure and nomenclature== There are several conventions for naming IFs currently in use. The preferred version uses a [1,2] or [2,1] to describe if the orientation of the methylene bridges on the 5 member rings are anti ([1,2]) or syn ([2,1]). The a, b, c designation indicates connectivity. a indicates there are no carbons between the indene and the starred fluorene carbon. Similarly, b indicates one carbon and c indicates two carbons. While indenofluorenes are members of the polycyclic hydrocarbon family, they are not necessarily members of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon family. For example, the fully conjugated versions, shown below, have 20π electrons making them formally anti-aromatic. First indenofluorene scaffold synthesized by Dr. Gabriel in 1884. The molecule is a substituted version of the [1,2-a] IF scaffold. ==Stability== Because of the instability of parent compounds, most synthesis work and research on indenofluorenes tend to focus on the dione substituted IFs, the fully conjugated IF, or the hydrogenated (methylene bridged) IFs. Even in these molecules, though, stability remains a problem so it is not uncommon to stabilize the core indenofluorene with aromatic or bulky substituents, such as mesityl or triisopropyl silyl. Similarly, the scope of indenofluorenes have been increasing over the decades to include heteroatoms, such as sulfur, within the ring system. Other structural expansions include addition of rings to the outer edges, off the center and expanding the center core. == Synthesis == There is no one way to synthesize each of the regioisomers and new routes are being discovered. Presented here are some of the published ways to get to synthetically useful versions of each IF. Preference was given to the most efficient way to get to the minimally substituted IF. === [1,2-a] IF === The first [1,2-a] IF scaffold was synthesized by Chardonens and Ritter in 1955. In their publication, they showed two ways to get to the dione of the [1,2-a] IF. The first utilizes an oxidative clevege followed by a ring closure utilizing concentrated sulfuric acid. Later they developed a route in which they condensed an indenyl ketone with quinolone base. This intermediate was then reacted sodium dichromate to produce the final dione in decent yield. Despite having multiple routes to the dione, the synthesis of the fully conjugated IF remained elusive until 2017. 600x600px Using the synthesis presented by Chardonens and Ritter, Dressler et al. appended various R- groups at the carbonyl to produce the diol product which was then reduced using a tin chloride catalyst to get to the desired product (below). The pure IF, with no substitution, was not synthesized due to instability. 800x800px === [1,2-b] IF === The first [1,2-b] IF, reported in 1951 by Deuschel and co-workers, used a route similar to the synthesis below. 800x800px This route produced the diol which could be used to make various derivatives. The collapse method, like the one shown below, was reported by Eglington et al. in 1960. This method successfully produces the parent IF in approximately 60% yield.600x600px === [2,1-a] IF === The [2,1-a] IF was the second one synthesized, after Gabriel's work, and was published in 1939 by Weizmann. His route is not shown here, as better yielding methods have been developed recently. Arguably the best route to the synthesis of the [2,1-a] IF is based on the work by Thirion et al. where they perform a Diels Alder reaction with 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene and dimethyl-but-2-ynedioate to build the skeleton of the IF. The center ring is aromatized using palladium on carbon to get to the diester. Saponification is performed to get to the carboxylic acid. Continuation with their route leads to the dione, in low yield, using a hot sulfuric acid closure. From the carboxylic acid, another route can be taken. If triflic acid, trifluoroacetic anhydride, and zinc bromide were added in a sealed reaction vessel to the carboxylic acid then heated, the result would be the desired dione in a 90 + percent yield 1000x1000px === [2,1-b] IF === 1000x1000pxThe first account of this scaffold was disclosed in 1951 by Deuschel et al. Chardonnens and Ritter, in 1955, offered the better route (shown above) in 79% yield === [2,1-c] IF === The [2,1-c] IF isomer was the last to be discovered and was published in 1961 by Ginsburg and Altman with an alternate route presented by Chardonnens and Ritter. Shown below is the original synthesis to the [2,1-c] dione.1000x1000pxIn 2012, the first example of the fully conjugated IF was disclosed by the Haley group at the University of Oregon as an unpublished work An alternate route, not shown here, was presented by Youngs et al. where they produced the [2,1-c] IF in a collapse method similar to that disclosed by Eglington for the [1,2-b] IF. The yield over the two steps was reported to be 91% == Properties == Properties of indenofluorenes vary significantly between each regioisomer and even within each regioisomer as substitutions change. Presented here are the general trends for each indenofluorene. === [1,2-a] IF === The properties of this regioisomer are not well known as of this point owing to the lack of synthetic routes. That said, the [1,2-a] IF is the only one that shows centrosymmetry. Dressler et al. recently published a paper on the first fully conjugated [1,2 - a] IF, and within that paper, they found a first reduction potential of -0.67 V === [1,2-b] IF === The [1,2-b] IF is distinguished from the other regioisomers first by having rotational symmetry. In crystal form, [1,2- b] IFs generally show one dimensional column stacking., however, the stacking can be tuned based on the substitution of the molecule. For example, the addition of fluorine to the molecule resulted in face to face π- stacking. No matter what substitution is present, though, the molecules pack fairly closely with distances of about 3.30 Å Kamatsu et al., in their work with [1,2-b] IFs, have shown that they behave as n-type semiconductors. The best n-type behavior was shown in the dione of the [1,2-b] IF in which the para positions were substituted with fluorine, which was presented by Yamahita et al. to be 0.17 cm2/Vċs. Cyclic voltammetry data has shown that various [1,2-b] IFs, can reversibly accept two electrons with the first reduction occurring at -0.8 V. The parent dione has a first reduction potential of -1.19 V, and halogenated versions reduce around -0.6 V. The fully conjugated version, first postulated by Deuschel in the 1950s, is believed to be even better as an electron carrier when compared to the analogus fullerene. This is believed to be due to a low lying LUMO, which was calculated in the Haley Group at the University of Oregon and corroborated by the Tobe group via crystal structure analysis. Confirmation of these low lying LUMOs wis provided by a tips acetylene appended, on the methyl bridges and the center ring, fully conjugated [1,2-b] IF had a first reduction of -0.62 V. The improvement in reduction potential is linked to the fact that the addition of 2 electrons yields an aromatic molecule with increased stability. However, the addition of the steric bulk required to make the molecule stable, lead to a herringbone crystal packing which is not favorable for electron mobility through the crystal. === [2,1-a] IF === Similar to indeno [1,2 -b] fluorenes, see above, indeno [2,1-a] fluorenes show strong biradical character. This biradical nature is both an advantage, in that it is believed that [2,1-a] IFs will make excellent organic electron carriers, and a curse, owing to the decreased stability of the molecule. The first reduction potential of the fully conjugated mesityl substituted compound is reported to be -1.51 V. Other versions of this IF regioisomer have had first reduction potentials as low as -2.48 V. As such, little work with this regioisomer has been published to-date and its properties remain largely unknown. === [2,1-b] IF === Similarly to the [2,1 - a] IF, [2,1 - b] IFs show a mirror plain of symmetry and strong biradical character. The first reduction of the fully conjugated methyl appended [2,1 - b] IF occurs at -1.13 V and the second reduction is at -2.03 V. === [2,1-c] IF === Like the other [2,1] isomers, this version also shows mirror plane symmetry, and similar to the [1,2-a] IF, there is very little know about this molecule. == Applications == Overall the applications for IFs are anticipated to be as replacement for fullerenes in organic electronic systems such as OLEDs, OFETs, and OPVCs. However, as IFs have been sparsely studied, to this point, actual applications and integration into products have yet to be achieved. Not all of the IF regioisomers are suited to incorporation into organic electronics mostly owing to difficult synthesis and instability. However, as research progresses, advances in synthesis are sure to be made. Similarly, as molecular libraries expand, trends in stability and electron carrying ability are likely to develop. == References == Category:Polycyclic aromatic compounds ","title":"Indenofluorene"},{"id":"56778844","text":"Ptenothrix is a genus of globular springtails in the family Dicyrtomidae.

Much of the supporting cast, specifically Shindle and Hewitt, were praised for their performances. Warren Carlyle's choreography was also very warmly received. Conversely, many critics called the direction and production bland and uninspired and the music forgettable. Bob Martin's book was also panned as not up to his usual comedic standards. https://www.amny.com/entertainment/the-sting-review-harry-connick- jr-1-17945481/ https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/sting- review-harry-connick-jr-leads-musical-paper-mill-article-1.3923654 ==References== Category:2018 musicals Category:Musicals based on films ","title":"The Sting (musical)"},{"id":"56778871","text":"Marichromatium is a genus in the phylum Proteobacteria (Bacteria).

One of fourteen University Air Squadrons, the unit traditionally recruits students from universities across the Yorkshire and Humber region and provides bursaries for those who wish to pursue a career in the Royal Air Force. ==History== YUAS was formed in 1969 when the University Air Squadron (UAS) from Hull and the UAS from Leeds, were combined to make YUAS. Leeds UAS was formed in January 1941 and had been allocated to airfields at Sherburn-in-Elmet and RAF Yeadon. Whilst at Yeadon, the squadron represented the final RAF presence when the airfield had gone over to a commercial operation as (what is now) Leeds Bradford Airport. Hull UAS was formed at RAF Driffield, but flew out of Leconfield and Brough. With the amalgamation of the two squadrons in 1969, flying was retained at RAF Leconfield for students from Hull University. As a formed squadron, YUAS first flew from RAF Church Fenton between 1969 and 1975. When Church Fenton was placed under a care and maintenance programme as a Relief Landing Ground (RLG) for RAF Linton-on-Ouse, the squadron moved to RAF Finningley in 1975. It returned to a resurgent Church Fenton in 1995 when RAF Finningley was closed. YUAS is one of fourteen University Air Squadrons that are spread out across Great Britain and it recruits from the universities at Bradford, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and York, with about 30 new intakes every year. Alongside the original universities that were listed for YUAS, students from Sheffield Hallam, Leeds College of Music, Leeds Metropolitan University and York St John University, can also apply to join YUAS. Students who join YUAS are enlisted as Officer Cadets in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and receive 30 hours of flying training annually. In 1998, a contract was signed to replace the Bulldog trainer aircraft with the Grob G115 (Tutor). A private company, Vosper Thorneycroft, were contracted to supply maintenance on the aircraft through a private contract. The Tutor aircraft was delivered to the University Air Squadrons from July 1999 onwards. In 2013, it was announced that RAF Church Fenton would be closing down and that all units would need to be transferred elsewhere. In the case of YUAS and No. 9 Air Experience Flight RAF, this would mean a transfer to RAF Linton-on-Ouse, some north-west of York. In 2014, a year after moving to Linton-on-Ouse, YUAS won the best University Air Squadron beating 13 other University Air Squadrons across Great Britain. ===Locations=== *March 1969 - August 1975: RAF Church Fenton *August 1975 - October 1995: RAF Finningley *October 1995 - August 2013: RAF Church Fenton *August 2013 - present: RAF Linton-on-Ouse Due to the closure of RAF Linton-on-Ouse in 2020, YUAS will move to a new location to operate from. ==ReferencesSources=== * ==External links== *YUAS Badge on RAF Heraldry Trust website Category:Royal Air Force university air squadrons Category:Military units and formations in the North Riding of Yorkshire Category:Military units and formations established in 1969 ","title":"Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron"},{"id":"56778960","text":"Crest is an unincorporated community in Upson County, Georgia, United States.Georgia Department of Transportation-Upson County ==Notes== Category:Unincorporated communities in Upson County, Georgia Category:Unincorporated communities in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Crest, Georgia"},{"id":"56778961","text":"Thea Krokan Murud (born 6 June 1994) is a Norwegian cross-country skier.

A July 1898 article in Phonoscope called her \\"the most successful and the most popular woman engaged in record making\\". Her first recordings, published by the United States Phonograph Company in 1894 or 1895, were advertised as \\"the first true records of a high soprano voice\\". She sang popular sentimental and comic songs like \\"Sweet Marie\\" and \\"The Sunshine of Paradise Alley\\" and remained in the United States catalog until joining the Columbia Phonograph Company in 1898 and adding operatic solos and duets (with Roger Harding) and older standards (Ben Bolt, Robin Adair, Foster's songs) to her repertoire. She continued recording into the early 1900s, making discs for Columbia and Victor of similar material. She recorded a few cylinders for the U.S. Everlasting company around 1910. Emmett also sang in productions of the Duquesne Garden Stock Opera Company and the Graw Opera Company.

The Alliance's forces are primarily drawn from the Hadhrami people in southern Yemen. During the civil war, the Alliance is often cited as supporting the government of Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and is noted for operating alongside the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces in Hadhramaut. == Operations == The Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance was formed in the Hadhramaut region of Southern Yemen, where it actively sought to gain more autonomy from the Yemeni Government. In 2014 Alliance actively fought against militants aligned with Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), though it also issued statements in opposition to the Yemeni Government following a series of terrorist attacks in Say'un, and members of the Alliance voiced doubts as to the effectiveness of the government's anti-terrorist campaigns. Following the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War in 2015, civil infighting created a power vacuum in Southern Yemen. The lack of an organized government presence in the reason allowed for militant groups, most notably AQAP, to take control of parts of the region. In response, the Tribal Alliance and a number of other militia groups formed a centralized military command to coordinate the defense of the lands under their control. In April 2015 forces from these tribes retook land around the cities of Mukalla and Shihr from AQAP and Ansar al-Sharia militants, whom had themselves captured Mukalla on 2 April. The Alliance participated in the Second Battle of Mukalla alongside Yemeni and UAE soldiers one year later in April 2016, and successfully drove AQAP and its affiliates out of Hadhramaut. As of 2018, the Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance remains aligned with the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and with the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. == References == Category:Yemeni Civil War (2015–present) ","title":"Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance"},{"id":"56779260","text":"Lev Sergeevich Bayandin (Russian: Лев Сергеевич Баяндин; January 2, 1942 – February 14, 2018) was a Russian politician who served as the first Governor of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug from 1991 until 1994.

In the film, the 2001 musical, and 2005 film adaptation the song is part of the stage musical titled Springtime for Hitler, which the two protagonists produce on Broadway. It was orchestrated by Philip J. Lang and staged by Alan Johnson for the former, with the latter productions orchestrated by Doug Besterman and staged by director Susan Stroman. == Composition and lyrics == In the film, it has four sections. It begins with a 4/4 interlude sung by actors dressed as Bavarian villagers who have found \\"a new leader to restore Germany's former glory.\\" For the main melody, the curtain opens to reveal chorus girls dressed in Ziegfeld-esque costumes laden with German and Nazi iconography and a male Nazi soloist singing: Springtime for Hitler and Germany Deutschland is happy and gay We're marching to a faster pace Look out! Here comes the master race Springtime for Hitler and Germany Rhineland's a fine land once more Springtime for Hitler and Germany Watch out, Europe, we're going on tour Springtime for Hitler and Germany Winter for Poland and France Springtime for Hitler and Germany Come on Germans, go into your dance. The next section is a tap-dance break with two solo lines in between; \\"I was born in Dusseldorf and that is why they call me Rolf\\",\\"Don't be stupid, be a smarty! Come and join the Nazi Party!\\" The latter line was dubbed by Mel Brooks in all versions of the song. The final section has the entire company reprising the main melody in slow 3/4 march tempo. Moreover, the verses are accompanied by a \\"happy chorus line\\". == Comparison between 1968 film, musical, and 2005 film == In the 1968 film, stage musical, and 2005 film, the Bavarian interlude, Ziegfeld menagerie, and Busby Berkeley-styled swastika formation remain largely unchanged. The first major difference between the 1968 film and the stage musical and 2005 film concerned the character who played the part of Adolf Hitler and the circumstances of Springtime for Hitler's surprise success. In the 1968, by the time song was over, the audience was ready to leave the theatre in disgust and horror, with Max and Leo, ecstatic their plan worked, retreating to a bar. But as the scene changes to reveal hippie actor Lorenzo St. Dubois aka 'L.S.D.'s (played by Dick Shawn) as Adolf Hitler, his wild improvisations prove to be an instant hit, leaving them in hysterical fits of laughter. In the musical and 2005 film, the character L.S.D. was omitted and the plot was changed to have the character Roger De Bris, the show's director, play Adolf Hitler after the original actor, the playwright Franz Liebkind, \\"broke (his) leg.\\" The character Ulla is now the part of the cast as Eva Braun and a Black Eagle. and Roger appears immediately after the dance break, He then sings a new section called \\"Heil Myself , followed by a reprise of the Bavarian interlude done in the style of Judy Garland. Most productions would follow this with a monologue of Hitler's rise to power. In others, it's followed by a satirical \\"Challenge Tap\\" dance with the Allied Leaders. In the musical, Springtime for Hitler is directly presented to the musical audience, with the positive reception confirmed in the following scene in Max and Leo's office. In the 2005 film, the audience is shown preparing to leave in disgust (similar to the 1968 film), but returns to their seats laughing after Roger's flamboyant Hitler appears. == Track listing == 7\\" single High Anxiety by Mel Brooks — 1978, Asylum Records E-45458, United States and Canada :Side 1. \\"High Anxiety\\" (2:30) :side 2. \\"Springtime For Hitler\\" (3:22) == Accolades == The song (in the original version from the 1967 film The Producers) was ranked 80th on the list of the \\"100 greatest songs in American cinema\\" released by the American Film Institute (AFI) in 2004. == References  External links == * Springtime for Hitler at Songfacts Category:Songs about Adolf Hitler Category:1967 songs Category:Songs written for films Category:Works by Mel Brooks ","title":"Springtime for Hitler (song)"},{"id":"56779360","text":"The 1977 Cal State Hayward Pioneers football team represented California State University, HaywardCalifornia State University, East Bay was known as California State University, Hayward from 1972 to 2004. in the 1977 NCAA Division II football season.

The focus of the project is to record and archive the stories of females who are activists and scholars within the socio-historical context of their own countries, formed with curricular and research goals at its core. The sources provided lend themselves to comparative and interdisciplinary work, addressing issues that reach across disciplines and provide information regarding activism, historical context, identity formation, and social movements. The interviews are designed to explore the ways in which different forms of activism intersect at various, distinct time points within the history of the represented countries. The project began with the integration of women's studies, an international perspective, and a focus on the activism within nations. The project emphasizes the relationship between women's activism and feminist scholarship and aims to represent transformations in feminism within each nation represented alongside the following parameters: conceptual, organizational, and social. == Methodology == The interviewees were selected by each country site's team according to criteria they developed, which often emphasized including individuals who differ by generation, geography, and type of activism, among other things. In the interviews, the women were prompted to discuss their families and upbringing, educational and professional experiences, and activism and involvement in social movements; thus, the University of Michigan program leaders did not control the narrative created of feminism in each country. The interviews took place in the interviewees' home country using their native language, later translated into English. Some notable interviewees include Ai Xiaoming, Flavia Agnes, Neera Desai, Dora María Téllez, Sofia Montenegro, Grace Lee Boggs, and Holly Hughes. For a full list of interviewees from the Global Feminisms Project, see list below. == Significance == The GFP created a collection of oral histories detailing the origins of feminist activists in several countries. The interviews have served as narrative examples of the feminist adage, \\"the political is personal.\\" They also expand the understanding of the intersections of gender, nationality, race, and women's studies, political climates, and personal experiences. The project has produced numerous resources that are publicly available including bibliographies, teaching modules, and the archive of video interviews. Additionally, the transcripts of all USA, Poland, Nicaragua, China, and India interviews in English have been entered into NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software, for individuals interested in using the interviews for research purposes. == List of Interviewees == * Shahjehan Aapa (India) * Rabab Abdulhadi (USA) * Luciana Adriano da Silva (Brazil) * Flavia Agnes (India) * Xiaoming, Ai (China) * Iara Amora Dos Santos (Brazil) * Adrienne Asch (USA) * Monica Baltodano (Nicaragua) * Grace Lee Boggs (USA) * Urvashi Butalia (India) * Bertha Ines Cabrales (Nicaragua) * Laura Castro (Brazil) * Mingxia, Chen (China) * Cathy Cohen (USA) * Violeta Delgado (Nicaragua) * Neera Desai (India) * Ima Thokchom Ramani Devi (India) * Mahasweta Devi (India) * Jarjum Ete (India) * Maria de Fatima Lima Santos (Brazil) * Marilda de Souza Francisco (Brazil) * Xiaoxian, Gao (China) * Youli, Ge (China) * Agnieszka Graff (Poland) * Anna Gruszczynska (Poland) * Zhonghua, He (China) * Holly Hughes (USA) * Elena Iarskaia-Smirnova (Russia) * Inga Iwasiow (Poland) * Juanita Jimenez (Nicaragua) * Natalia Yurievna Kamenskaia (Russia) * Yelena Viktorovna Kochkina (Russia) * Maria Grigorievna Kotovskaia (Russia) * Marian Kramer (USA) * Barbara Labuda (Poland) * Huiying, Li (China) * Barbara Limanowska (Poland) * Matilde Lindo (Nicaragua) * Anna Lipowska-Teutsch (Poland) * Bohong, Liu (China) * Lata Pratibha Madhukar (India) * Marina Mikhailovna Malisheva (Russia) * Mangai (India) * Diana Martinez (Nicaragua) * Vina Mazumdar (India) * Yamileth Mejia (Nicaragua) * Maria Biktorovna Mikhailova (Russia) * Sofia Montenegro (Nicaragua) * Giordana Moreira (Brazil) * Marianna Muravieva (Russia) * Vilma Nunez (Nicaragua) * Martha Ojeda (USA) * Maria da Penha (Brazil) * Angelica Souza Pinheiro (Brazil) * Natalia Lvovna Pushkareva (Russia) * Sandra Ramos (Nicaragua) * Joanna Regulska (Poland) * Natalia Mikailovna Rimashevskaia (Russia) * Loretta Ross (USA) * D.

On 17 February 2012 he was elected rector of the Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava. He was also minister of education of Romania from 30 January to 27 September 2018. ==Academic career== Popa obtained a degree in electronic and telecommunications engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Iasi, the current Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, in 1989. He started his academic career as a teaching assistant in a college of this university in Suceava, which would one year later become the current Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava. He obtained a PhD from the same Polytechnic Institute of Iasi in 1998, and rose through all the academic ranks in Suceava until he became full professor in 2005, and was habilitated to supervise doctoral research in 2009. On 17 February 2012 he was elected rector of the Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava. ==International profile== During his mandate as rector, Popa raised the international profile of Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava. On 7 July 2015, the President of Moldova, Nicolae Timofti, was awarded an honorary doctorate by this university, in the presence of the President of Romania, Klaus Iohannis. Popa was also the one who proposed Russian ambassador Valeri Kuzmin at a seminar in Suceava to strengthen scientific co-operation in order to improve tank braking systems. The polemic Moscow diplomat in Bucharest had declared that Russia had not intervened in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbass, as proved by the fact that, when they really did intervene in Abkhazia, their tanks did not stop until they were close to the Georgian capital Tbilisi. In 2015 he sponsored the creation of the first master's degree entirely taught in English at the University of Suceava, which was also the subject of a double-degree agreement with a Spanish university. ==Political activity== The nominalization of Popa as minister of national education faced the initial opposition of an influential faction of the Social Democratic Party (Romania). They backed the powerful Ecaterina Andronescu, who had been active in national politics since 1996, including three times as minister of national education. Commentators of this internal conflict, that was very apparent in the Executive Committee of the party, already foresaw that the \\"hunt\\" of the new appointee, as they defined it, would continue in the media. But Popa's nomination resisted the pressures, as he had the backing not only of his party in Suceava, but also of 45 out of 48 Romanian rectors and, most importantly, the national leader of the party, Liviu Dragnea. On 27 September 2018 he announced his resignation as minister of national education, as a result of a dispute with UDMR, a key partner of the coalition government he was part of, over whether Romanian language courses for Hungarian minority pupils should be taught by native Romanian speakers. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Romanian Ministers of Education Category:Rectors of universities in Romania Category:1964 births ","title":"Valentin Popa"},{"id":"56779558","text":"Echium aculeatum is a species of flowering plants of the family Boraginaceae.

He also served as the acting Mayor of Allentown until March 29, 2018, when he was succeeded in the office by Ray O'Connell. MacLean became the acting mayor on Friday, March 9, 2018, with the resignation of Mayor Ed Pawlowski, who was convicted by jury on March 1, 2018, on 47 felony charges related to a pay-to- play scheme involving his asking for campaign donations in exchange for city contracts and favors. From 2006 to 2013, MacLean served as the Chief of Police of the Allentown Police Department. His entry into elective politics began in 2015 when he was elected to Allentown's City Council, winning that seat over the incumbent Joe Davis. ==BiographyPersonal life and education=== MacLean graduated from William Allen High School and he earned a Master's Degree in criminal justice from DeSales University in Center Valley, Pennsylvania. Father to six children, Alyssa MacLean is the youngest. A lifelong resident of Allentown, MacLean resides in the city's West End neighborhood. ===Allentown Police Department=== From 1972 until 2013, Roger MacLean served as a police officer with the Allentown Police Department, including his final eight years as Chief of Police. He graduated from both the FBI National Academy and the FBI Law Enforcement Executive Development Seminar. MacLean joined the Allentown Police Department in 1972 as a cadet. In 1974, he was promoted to a commissioned officer and served within the department's tactical squad, 1st Platoon, and the mounted patrol. In 1982, Allentown Police Chief Carson S. Gable demoted MacLean and three other police officers following accusations by the Mayor Joseph Daddona that the quartet were part of a group of supporters of the previous police chief, Arthur Allender. The four were also accused by the mayor of bullying behavior, which damaged department morale and operated outside of the command. MacLean and his colleagues filed a lawsuit against the city in response, denying the allegation against them and accusing the Daddona administration of demoting them because they had not supported the mayor during his election campaign. MacLean and the other officers eventually won their lawsuit and were each awarded $125,000 in damages in 1988. MacLean was further promoted to the positions of detective sergeant in 1984 and patrol lieutenant in 1990. He commanded the 2nd and 3rd Platoons until his 1997 reassignment as supervisor of the investigation division's B Team. In 1994, MacLean joined with 18 other Allentown police captains and lieutenants in lawsuit against the city. The 19 plaintiffs charged that the city government had denied them pay raises that would have equaled the senior members of the police union, the Fraternal Order of Police. The officers, including MacLean, won the lawsuit in 1996. In 1997, MacLean and two other police officers filed another suit against the city. The trio charged that then-Mayor William Heydt had denied them promotions within the police department because they had won the previous 1994 lawsuit. The city reached a legal settlement with MacLean and two other officers. As part of the settlement, MacLean $20,000 and six-months free rent at a property owned by the city of Allentown. MacLean rose to become second in command of the Allentown Police Department's Emergency Response Team. He also taught courses at the Allentown Police Academy. In 2001, Allentown Mayor William Heydt, who was near the end of his second term, appointed MacLean as the city's acting police chief. Heydt's successor, Mayor Roy Afflerbach, who took office in January 2002, replaced MacLean with a permanent police chief, Stephen L. Kuhn. MacLean served as patrol captain from 2002 until his appointment as Chief of the Allentown Police Department by Mayor Ed Pawlowski in 2006. From 1972 to 2006, MacLean received six departmental commendations, including three for bravery and heroism. In January 2006, new Mayor Ed Pawlowski, who had been elected in 2005, appointed Roger MacLean as the new Police Chief of Allentown, replacing outgoing Chief Joseph Blackburn. MacLean was a 31-year veteran of the police force at the time. Pawlowski announced MacLean's appointment on January 6, 2006, just three days after taking office. Two other officers, David Howells Jr. and Joseph Hanna, were appointed assistant police chiefs by the mayor. Roger MacLean retired as Police Chief of Allentown on September 6, 2013, after four decades with the police force. Assistant Police Chief Joseph Hanna was named interim Police Chief until a permanent replacement for MacLean could be appointed. On September 16, 2013, just days after his retirement from the Allentown Police Department, MacLean began a new job as the chief investigator of the Lehigh County Regional Intelligence and Investigation Center (RIIC). ===Political career=== In 2014, MacLean switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democratic just before applying for a vacancy on the Allentown City Council. However, another candidate was selected to fill the vacant city council seat instead of MacLean. One year later, MacLean was elected to the Allentown City Council by defeating incumbent councilman Joe Davis in the 2015 election. In 2016, MacLean voted a against a budget resolution, saying it increased Allentown's existing budget deficit. He was also one of just two council members who opposed a new city stormwater fee. Following the 2017 indictment of Mayor Ed Pawlowski on 54 pay-to-play charges, MacLean broke with his city council colleagues to oppose a resolution which urged federal investigator to speed up their investigation of Pawlowski. MacLean also voted against a proposal to hire an attorney to consult on potentially removing Mayor Pawlowski from office. Though he voted against these proposals, MacLean and Pawlowski had a strained relationship dating back to his tenure as police chief. On January 2, 2018, MacLean was unanimously elected President of the Allentown City Council by its members. The leadership role on the city council meant that MacLean would become acting mayor in the event that Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski resigned or was removed from office. MacLean's election as city council president came just weeks before Mayor Pawlowski was scheduled to go on trial, starting January 16, 2018, on 54 pay- to-play charges. On March 1, 2018, Mayor Ed Pawlowski was convicted on 47 of the 54 charges related to pay-to-play scheme he operated from office. Pawloski's convictions, all felonies, included conspiracy, as well as multiple counts of bribery, attempted extortion, making false statements to federal officials, honest services fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. Pawloski resigned from office on Thursday, March 9, 2018. In accordance with the city's home charter rule, city council president Roger MacLean became acting Mayor of Allentown on March 9 upon Pawlowski's resignation. MacLean served as acting mayor until March 29, 2018, when Pawlowski's permanent successor, Ray O'Connell, was chosen. O'Connell will serve until the 2019 mayoral election. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Allentown, Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania city council members Category:American municipal police chiefs Category:American municipal police officers Category:Pennsylvania Democrats Category:DeSales University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Roger MacLean"},{"id":"56779562","text":"The 1979 Cal State Hayward Pioneers football team represented California State University, HaywardCalifornia State University, East Bay was known as California State University, Hayward from 1972 to 2004. in the 1979 NCAA Division II football season.

The “town hall”, as it was called, was built in the fall of 1874 by the city and the Masons to be used conjointly as a city meeting place and the Mason’s Golden Fleece Lodge. It was twenty-six feet wide, seventy-two feet long and two stories high. The Masons used the upstairs. In 1875, Reuben S. Hershey & Co. owned the lot. On February 1, 1878, women’s rights leader Susan B. Anthony spoke at the hall for the benefit of the library association. They made a whopping $10 that night from audience donations. Susan was touring the country campaigning for the National Woman Suffrage Association’s promotion of a federal woman’s suffrage amendment. (Voting rights for women.) After much urging from the local newspapers in the late 1890s, the city finally decided to get rid of the old building and put up a new brick “Opera House”. The new Litchfield Opera House was designed by architect William T. Towner and built in late 1900 with Ames Brickyard Litchfield bricks by N.P. Franzen. Upstairs at the old fire hall building at 30 Second Street West filled in as the city’s town hall for a short time. The Opera House building is an example of “Renaissance Revival” architecture. Opening night was Thursday, November 8, 1900. The William Owens’ traveling troupe performed The Marble Heart by Charles Selby that night. By the way, that play was the last play John Wilkes Booth performed in before he assassinated Abraham Lincoln. (The play was also known as “The Sculptor’s Dream”. The play tells the story of a Greek sculptor, reincarnated as a Frenchman, whose marble sculptures eventually come to life right before his eyes.) Two years later, the Opera House staged Shakespeare’s Othello. In 1901, this article ran in one of our Litchfield newspapers: “Sanford Dodge, the well-known romantic actor, and tragedian, will play an engagement at the Opera House beginning Oct. 21. His production of ‘Virginius’ is very elaborate and has been pronounced by good authorities to be one of the best-acted tragedies of modern stage. There are many fine bursts of poetry in the play which are introduced with great dramatic propriety and skill. It is full of high passion with deep pathos making it intensely interesting and impressive throughout. This will be a notable event for our community.” Besides operas and performances, the Opera House housed town meetings, elections, military recruitments, and other government functions. In 1912, the building was managed by Charles Andress Brasie. From 1900 to 1924, operas, plays, dances and band concerts were held in the building. But in October of 1917, the United Theatres Company, headed by Bart Foster, leased the building to show movies and stage vaudeville shows. Edwin J. Gates and Floyd Rothlisberger leased the building in May of 1920 to show movies also. Finally, David T. Hopson, who owned the Unique Theater downtown, had enough and appealed to the city to stop being his competition. When they didn’t listen, he sold the Unique. A lawyer’s wife, Marion Rhoda (Mrs. Ernest Wells) Campbell, donated the huge red velvet curtain that had hung on the stage at the Opera House. She is also credited with saving the Bank of Litchfield by depositing a huge sum of money when it was on the brink of failure. In November of 1920, Gates and Rothlisberger gave up their lease on the building and it went back to being used for local plays, band concerts, dances, roller skating, non-school basketball games, and city meetings. The Opera House was remodeled in 1935 to be used exclusively as the city’s offices and Community Building and that’s the name most people have always known it by, not the “Opera House”. In 1962, part of the back of the building was turned into an extended art classroom for the high school. The police department and mayor’s office were moved from over the old fire hall to the front of the building in April of 1963. In the front were offices, but the back had a large gymnasium with a stage. Because the sidewalks in town were so bad, kids went to the Community Building for free roller-skating, usually in the basement. You had to provide your own skates. They also went to the Community Building for gun training, club meetings, or for a free lunch during REA Days. Teen dances were held in the Community Building also. The Opera House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for its “significance to the community”. The city offices were in the building for a long time, but the building was eventually abandoned because of mold problems in 2002. The city moved its offices from the building to trailers in the parking lot. A new city hall was built next door at 126 North Marshall Avenue. In the spring of 2003, the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota named it to its list of Minnesota’s ten most endangered historic properties. The building then was purchased by the Greater Litchfield Opera House Association Inc. on January 4, 2008 and now continues to serve the community of Litchfield. It is run by a dedicated group of volunteers with its president as Connie Lies. Litchfield’s friend and champion Darlene Kotelnicki said, “The Greater Litchfield Opera House Assn., Inc. was formed in Sept. 2007 and came to the Litchfield City Council later that month. We offered to buy the building for $100,000 minus the $65,000 it would cost the city to demo it. We asked for a 10-year interest-free contract for deed for the balance. Two weeks (later), the city had a counteroffer: purchased price $100,000 and they would accept $1 for payment with the understanding the balance ($99,999) be put into the building for the community. I shook Mayor Madson’s hand and gave him a 1900 silver dollar (which is now framed in City Hall). City Administrator Bruce Miller told me we would not get the papers signed until Jan. 2008 for two reasons. One was for tax purposes.... we would have one less year of taxes and that would help our organization. Two, we would need three months to get our organization formed BEFORE we started with the building! That was some if the best advice ever. Our first board was just average citizens with a firm desire to save the building: Mickey Scullard, Chuck Pease, Milfred Smith, Dave Lindberg, Mary Root, Butch Schulte, Kathy Bren, Richard Pennertz, and myself. Many have served since, but these nine average people said, ‘yes’ to serving on a board for an issue that the majority of the community said would fail!” The building is available for rental for parties, weddings, dinners, funeral, bar mitzvahs, and other personal events. ==References * Litchfield Opera House Association Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Minnesota Category:Theatres completed in 1900 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Meeker County, Minnesota Category:Opera houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota ","title":"Litchfield Opera House"},{"id":"56779604","text":"\\"Fuldans\\" is a song performed by Swedish danceband Rolandz in Melodifestivalen 2018.

In 1800 she made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). She traded widely as different owners deployed her on one route or another.

She was one of 28 vessels that sailed on that mission between December 1800 and February 1801. Suffolk sailed on 25 December 1800 and returned on 28 February 1802. Lloyd's List reported on 25 February 1825 that Suffolk, Allison, master, had been blown out of Madeira on 25 January and that she had not returned by the 28th.Lloyd's List №5989. Following the resumption of war with France in early 1803, concern developed in Britain about Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. The British government's response took many forms including the reactivation of Fencible regiments and the Sea Fencibles, a program of the construction of Martello Towers along the coasts of Britain and Ireland, and the commissioning of a number of armed defense ships. The British East India Company in November voted to underwrite 10,000 tons (bm) of armed transports to protect Great Britain's coasts. The vessels were existing, but not EIC, merchantmen that would receive an upgrade in armament and in some cases a naval officer as captain. The vessels were: Albion, , , Aurora, , , , Helder, , , Lord Nelson, , , , , Sir Alexander Mitchell, Suffolk, and Triton. On 21 November 1803 Suffolk, of 362 tons (bm) and 16 guns, was ready but yet to be allocated to her station.Naval Database. The Royal Navy returned the armed defense ships to their owners by the second half of 1805. In 1836 new owners, Richard Wilson and George Foggo, shifted her registry to Whitby. She was broken up in December 1844. ==Note== Because Suffolk and both sailed to Bengal at the same time to bring back rice, and was launched in Bengal, the three vessels are sometimes conflated. { class=\\"sortable \\" - !

Such abuse may not happen face-to-face, nor does it necessarily require physical contact. However, online abuse can result in negative face-to-face consequences in the form of statutory rape, forcible sexual assault, harassment, etc. In the United States, online child abuse is recognized as a form of child abuse by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Online abuse of children can occur through a variety of forms including, but not limited to cyber-bullying, grooming, and sexual abuse. Such abuse requires the use of the World Wide Web or cellphones, increasing its significance in an increasingly technological world. The perpetrator of such online abuse may be a stranger or someone who is previously known by the victim. A report by the Data & Society Research Institute and the Center for Innovative Public Health Research showed that 72% of U.S. Internet users have witnessed some form of online harassment or abuse, while 47% have personally experienced it. This study found no distinction between genders with respect to harassment, but deduced that women were at risk for a wider variety of online abuse. Governments across the world have acknowledged the importance of recognizing and combating online abuse of children. In the United States this effort is led by the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. This task force consists of 61 individual task forces engaging with 4,500 federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies all with the goal of combating online abuse of children. == Cyber-bullying == Cyber-bullying, or Internet bullying, occurs when an individual or group electronically distributes negative, false, or otherwise harmful content about an individual or group using personal or private information that causes humiliation or distress to that individual. Cyber-bullying can happen through the use of any device that is able to connect to the Internet (desktop, mobile devices, gaming devices, etc.) of cellphones and does not require the perpetrator to be in the same vicinity of the victim.Slonje, R., & Smith, P.

Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 49(2), 147-154. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9450.2007.00611.x Cyber- bullying is especially prevalent among children as an extension of bullying within schools. A Canadian research study found that children who were victims of cyber-bullying and also bullied in school were more likely to bully others over cyberspace. === Prevalence === Studies show a rising trend in online bullying. Although it remains the least-reported form of bullying it is relatively hidden and believed to be under-reported. Because victims often cannot evade cyber-bullies, they may harbor feelings of guilt, incompetence or despair. Upwards of 37% of victims of cyber-bullying do not report their abuse. According to statistics of cyber-bullying from the i-SAFE Foundation, more than 50% of adolescents have been the victims of cyber-bullying, where one-third of them have been threatened online.I-Safe Inc. (2004). Cyber Bullying: Statistics and Tips. Retrieved March 07, 2018, from https://www.isafe.org/outreach/media/media_cyber_bullying A roughly equal number admit to having engaged in perpetrating cyber-bullying themselves.I-Safe Inc. (2004). Cyber Bullying: Statistics and Tips. Retrieved March 07, 2018, from https://www.isafe.org/outreach/media/media_cyber_bullying Of the victims that reported their abuse, 25% reported repeated cyber- bullying. The Harford County Examiner reported that far more than 50% of child victims hid the issue from their parents when it occurred. The same examination reported that 1 in 10 youths had damaging photos taken of themselves without their permission, and that girls are more likely to be involved with cyber-bullying than boys, both as bullies and as victims. Different social groups and ages tend to receive differing amounts of unwanted negative feedback. For example, a reported 55.2% of young LGBTQ community members have been victims of cyber-bullying. Another trend shows that school- aged children are more likely to be victims of online abuse. === Variation === A study in 2011 found three primary reasons for targeting others over the Internet: informal social control, dominance, and entertainment.Rafferty, R. S. (2011). Motivations behind Cyber Bullying and Online Aggression: Cyber Sanctions, Dominance, and Trolling Online (Doctoral dissertation, Ohio University). Informal social control is applying pressure to change another person's behavior. Dominance refers to the attempt(s) of hurting someone, humiliating someone, or gaining access to their personal information (secrets, explicit photos, etc.). Entertainment refers to what is commonly known as trolling: purposefully humiliating, annoying, or bothering someone for the purpose of eliciting an emotional response for the bully's enjoyment. Perpetrators of trolling are called trolls, which are a subset of cyberbullies.Craker, N., & March, E. (2016). The dark side of Facebook®: The Dark Tetrad, negative social potency, and trolling behaviors. Personality and Individual Differences, 102, 79-84. === Effects === Cyber-bullying is very common among children and young adults that are ten to eighteen years old.Vandebosch, H., & Cleemput, K. V. (2008). Defining Cyber-bullying: A Qualitative Research into the Perceptions of Youngsters. Cyber-Psychology & Behavior, 11(4), 499-503. doi:10.1089/cpb.2007.0042 Victims of cyber-bullying, often feel negative about themselves after being bullied. It is also common for cyber-bullying to have negative effects on cyber victims' social well- being because it has a negative impact on their self-esteem.Dianne L. Hoff, Sidney N. Mitchell, (2009) \\"Cyber-bullying: causes, effects, and remedies\\", Journal of Educational Administration, Vol. 47 Issue: 5, pp.652-665, https://doi.org/10.1108/09578230910981107 Permanent link to this document:https://doi.org/10.1108/09578230910981107 Downloaded on: 16 February 2018, At: 14:44 (PT) Another consequence of cyber-bullying is that a cyber victim may fear for their own safety.Chandrashekhar, A. M., Muktha, G. S., & Anjana, D. K. (2016). Cyber-bullying and cyber-stalking. Imperial Journal of Interdisciplinary Research (IJIR), 3(1), 147-168. doi:10.1017/cbo9780511843846.008 Further research conducted by Patchin & Hinduja (2010) found that those involved with cyber-bullying, as perpetrators, victims, or both, have significantly lower self-esteem than those who have little to no exposure to cyber-bullying.Patchin, J. W. and Hinduja, S. (2010), Cyber-bullying and Self-Esteem*. Journal of School Health, 80: 614-621. doi:10.1111/j.1746-1561.2010.00548.x Kowalski & Limber (2013) also found that bullies and victims had the most negative scores on most measures of psychological health, physical, health, and academic performance.Kowalski, R. M., & Limber, S. P. (2013). Psychological, Physical, and Academic Correlates of Cyber-bullying and Traditional Bullying. Journal of Adolescent Health, 53(1). doi:10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.09.018Mishna, F., Saini, M., & Solomon, S. (2009). Ongoing and online: Children and youth's perceptions of cyber bullying. Children and Youth Services Review, 31(12), 1222-1228. === Laws === United States In the United States, parents are encouraged to monitor their children's online activity and deal with cyber-bullying appropriately. If cyber-bullying involves sexual content or sexting, however, the cyberbully and their parents can also be subject to legal consequences, including being registered as sexual offenders. Cyber-bullying that does not involve explicit sexual content can be more difficult to prosecute because there are no federal laws directly protecting children from direct forms of cyber-bullying. Cases of cyber-bullying are difficult to pursue in the United States due to infringement on First Amendment rights (i.e.: freedom of speech). U.S. schools can take action on incidents that occur outside of school if there is either a clear 'disruption to the educational process' or a 'true' threat to one (or more) of the students. For an expression to be considered a 'true' threat, the federal court must determine \\"whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault\\". As cyberbulling is increasingly recognized as a nationwide issue in the United States, whether or not public schools can limit their students' speech outside of school hours is becoming more of an issue. High-profile cases of cyberbullying have been brought to the attention of state and local legislatures, and most U.S. states have implemented laws that ban any online communication that aims to cause humiliation, emotional distress, or fright.\\"[Unites States of America v. Lori Drew,\\" 2009] Prosecution of cyber- bullying cases are usually a combination of civil laws that best fit the nature of each individual case. Most states have both anti-bullying laws and policies, save for Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas. Stopbullying.gov, a federal agency tasked with preventing all forms of bullying, has created a detailed list of state laws and policies. An examples of a state anti-bullying campaign is the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center, which provides curriculum to educators about cyber-bullying and its connection to bullying inside of schools. Cyber-bullying was specifically targeted in federal law by the Megan Meier Cyber-bullying Prevention Act introduced to the House of Representatives in 2009. This prevention act sought to: This act was the result of the suicide of Megan Meier in 2006. Megan was the victim of cyber-bullying by a mother and teen daughter, which resulted in Megan committing suicide in her home in Missouri. == Grooming == Grooming is a phenomenon that can occur on or offline. The official definition of grooming used by the U.S. Department of Justice is: The above definition emphasizes the use of the child's family in building trust with the child. When grooming occurs online, however, this is frequently done without the knowledge or compliance of any adult. When children can use the Internet without supervision, there is more room for potential abuse. Online grooming itself can be driven by a variety of things. Most common is the use of online grooming to build a trusting relationship with a child in order to engage in either online or in-person sexual acts. The Internet is used to lead a child to potential sexual behavior. Grooming can also be used for other forms of exploitation of the child, such as blackmail for monetary gain and more. The two forms may be used in combination, with groomers convincing children to perform these sexual acts, such as the sending of nude photographs, and then blackmailing the victim by threatening to release information about them. === Variation === Online grooming can occur in a variety of ways. Most commonly, chat rooms or social networks are used to make initial contact with possible victims. Groomers may also use photo- sharing apps, dating apps, or gaming websites to find their victims. After establishing an online relationship, the groomer turns conversations to more personal matters, frequently sexual topics. Groomers may then engage in sexual conversations with their victims, send nude photos or videos, encourage sexual acts on webcam, or persuade the victim to meet in person for sexual acts. Groomers are not exclusively strangers. They can be family friends or individuals who have met the child before but primarily use the Internet in order to strengthen that relationship for future exploitation of the child. Individual groomers can be of any sex, gender, or age. Grooming is considered a complicated matter, and groomers may use many tactics. Groomers may use compliments or make promises to the child in order to elicit certain behaviors. Groomers may also assert control over the child to exploit natural sexual curiosity. Frequently, groomers make a fake profile in order to create a persona more likely to be trusted by their possible victims. Such a phenomenon is known as catfishing. The definition of a catfish is \\"a person who sets up a false personal profile on a social networking site for fraudulent or deceptive purposes.\\" Although catfishing is not exclusively used by online groomers, it is a common way in which groomers contact their potential victim and build trust through a more-trustworthy false identity. Catfishing itself is not illegal in the United States, unlike identity theft, but when used as a method for online grooming is considered as the crime of grooming. === Prevalence === Grooming and overall online abuse of children is an issue of growing concern in the modern technological era. Victims of online grooming are frequently young teens, with the majority of victims being between the ages of 13 and 15. In a 2012 literature review of research in the area conducted by various English scholarly institutions, it was found that 9% of Internet users aged 10–17 reported unwanted online sexual solicitation or attempted grooming. === Laws === United States In the United States, grooming is considered a federal offense. Several federal laws include sections involving grooming. Under section § 2422 of the United States Criminal Code: The U.S. Bar Association claims that this statute \\"targets the sexual grooming of minors as well as the actual sexual exploitation of them.\\" Because of grooming's complex nature and the relationship of trust between the groomer and the victim, grooming in and of itself is infrequently left unrecognized. Only when the grooming results in sexual acts between an adult and a minor, the exchange of sexual images, or the extortion of money does it come to the eyes of a court. In the case of Shelly Chartier, the online grooming and resulting crimes were met with jail time. Chartier, through the use of catfishing both NBA star Chris Andersen and aspiring model Paris Dunn, groomed 17-year-old Dunn into exchanging nude photos and sexual acts under the false identity of Andersen. She then sent such images to Andersen who was under the impression that he was both receiving these from Dunn herself and that Dunn was not underage. Chartier then extorted money from Andersen, claiming she would reveal his possession of child pornography unless he paid her. Chartier was eventually caught and faced 18 months in prison for various crimes, including, but not limited to, extortion, impersonation, and making threats. State legislatures, such as Illinois, have introduced language that specifically includes electronic or web-based methods of grooming into their laws. === Non-governmental advocacy === In addition to legislation, there are several non-governmental programs and initiatives aimed at the issue. For example, R.AGE, a Malaysian-based group of journalists, aims to spread information about many important issues, including online safety and the occurrence of online grooming, in the hopes of \\"telling stories that matter, that make a difference, that hold people accountable, that give a voice to those who don't have one.\\" In addition, Pandora's Protect is a nonprofit organization that aims to provide support to the victims of crimes such as online grooming and assault. In addition, they spread information in order to prevent further assaults. == Sexual abuse == Online sexual abuse is a relatively modern trend, in which perpetrators utilize modern forms of technology such as live stream web cameras, cell phones, or social media to coerce targeted victims into inappropriate and sometimes illegal sex acts. Abusers do not discriminate and target victims of every walk of life. Online sexual abuse differs from other forms of sexual abuse in that it can be perpetrated stealthily on a global scale, allowing the offender to evade capture. At the same time, technology offers predators greater opportunities to find the youth that they prey upon. Children are often the targets of online sexual predators who will often bully, emotionally manipulate, blackmail, or befriend willing communicators on the web in order to obtain their desires. Online sexual abuse may vary from personal interactions between a victim and offender to a more mechanized process, in which children are sexually exploited for the perpetrators' profit. Online sexual predators often target young victims, with a study showing that 13% of children receive negative unwanted attention of a sexual nature on the Internet. Predators make contact with prospective targets in a variety of settings, although the most prolific place that predators troll is chat rooms, where 76% of known first encounters with online sexual predators occur. Predators troll chat rooms and other forms of social media like MySpace or Facebook, seeking people who outwardly share personal information. Detection and deterrence of online sexual abuse are difficult because of the anonymous nature of the Internet; however, stopping and detecting an online predator's criminal activity is the task of various government organizations like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI's Violent Crimes Against Children Program was specifically created, \\"...to provide a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive counter to all threats of abuse and exploitation of children\\" in its jurisdiction. The FBI accomplishes quick response times by having agents scouring the Internet in search of perpetrators; they ask for information in forums and chat-rooms and look for the telltale signs of abusive behavior in the children they interact with. Online sexual predators, however, are often difficult to distinguish because they show a misleading representation of themselves to avoid incriminating evidence. Rather than relying completely on authorities to apprehend the perpetrators of online sexual abuse, one may decrease the chances of unwanted and unsolicited advances from online predators by keeping one's intimately private details off of the Internet. Another way to avoid unwanted sexual solicitations is to ignore, block, and report an offender to the website's management staff. === Laws === United States A variety of laws are in place to deter online criminal activity pertaining to sexual abuse. The Federal Criminal Code and Rules outlines a variety of rules and regulations regarding sexual abuse under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1462 titled Importation or transportation of obscene matters, outlines what would be considered transporting obscene material over the Internet. Child pornography violates this law, among others, because under this code, \\"Any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of indecent character\\" may be subject to fine or imprisonment of up to five years. Online sexual offenders who target children may also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 2243 Sexual abuse of a minor or ward or Section 2251 Sexual exploitation of children under which they could be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. These sections are outlined as, \\"...aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward, or sex trafficking of children, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography ... not less than 30 years or for life [or can carry] any term years or for life.\\" As noted, any sexual abuse of children, whether online or in person, is subject to strict punishment by law. === Examples === Online abuse often manifests itself in physical and psychological harm to victims, as previously stated. In recent history, Larry Nassar, a USA Gymnastics team doctor, was charged with 60 years in federal prison when he pleaded guilty to charges related to receiving child pornography, possessing child pornography, and destroying and concealing evidence relating to child pornography. Prosecutors have stated that a supremely close link between his child pornography activities had directly impacted his repeat, \\"molestation of children\\". At the height of his child pornography obsession, Nassar had thousands of pictures of underage children. In the wake of this scandal, affecting hundreds of women of a variety of ages, reforms have been made to further combat future occurrences of this abuse by USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. Also gathering a large following in the wake of this scandal is the Me Too movement. ==See also== * Child abuse * Cyberbullying ==References== Category:Child sexual abuse Category:Cyberbullying Category:Cybercrime ","title":"Online child abuse"},{"id":"56779680","text":"Terese Delaney (m.

Her son, Gary Moore, took over the farm when Mr. and Mrs. Moore passed away. == Battle against the USDA == In Tillery, North Carolina, the USDA or the Farm Security Administration (FSA) was tightly controlled by a Caucasian, male group. African-American farmers were settled in the floodplains next to the Roanoke River while the Caucasian farmers were moved to the hillside where flooding did not occur. Along with higher flood risks, African-Americans received fewer allotments. Matthew and Florenza Moore Grant had been receiving threats of foreclosure by the FSA because of their race. Gary Grant later sued the USDA for practicing racial discrimination in 1997. == Registering to vote == Many African-Americans had been trying to get registered to vote in Halifax County, North Carolina. Groups of people would head down to the courthouse, but get sent away. One Saturday Florenza Moore Grant's husband asked her to try to register. Grant went down to the courthouse and was questioned about her education and if she was willing to abide by the rules while a Caucasian woman around the age of 18 walked right into the courthouse and registered without a problem. Grant had to read and write a portion of the Constitution, but she had been practicing reading and writing the constitution. She got to correct the registrar a few times and passed with ease. The registrar was livid with Mrs. Grant, but he registered her. ==See also== *Civil rights movement == References == Category:1921 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Civil rights movement ","title":"Florenza Moore Grant"},{"id":"56779736","text":"Gene M.

It later became part of the Milan - Bologna Railway. ==History== The company was established in Florence by Bartolomeo Cini with the collaboration of the brothers Pietro and Tommaso, in order to obtain the concession, following the Convention stipulated in Rome on 1 May 1851 between the governments of the Papal States, of the Austrian Empire, of the Duchy of Modena, of the Duchy of Parma and of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany for the construction of a railway starting in Piacenza and continuing to Parma, Reggio Emilia and Modena up to Bologna and from there towards Tuscany and Prato or Pistoia. There would be a junction at Reggio Emilia with a branch coming from the Po in the direction of Mantua. ===Finance=== A Building and Administration Committee was set up which, once activated, would be replaced by a Management Committee. A fund was established of seventy-five million Italian lire divided into seventy-five thousand bearer shares. Article 5 of the Trust Act established that, in addition to the company's headquarters in Florence, a domicile in Modena would also have to be elected, in which a Plenipotentiary Representative would be established to deal definitively with the International Commission established for the purposes of the Modena project. The company began issuing shares to raise the necessary capital for which the governments would guarantee a 5% interest. The following years, however, did not give the expected results as regards the raising of capital needed for the works on the Bologna - Pistoia section. In the summer of 1853 the company began the excavation of two shafts for the construction of the Apennine Tunnel and some preliminary works along the way. Financial difficulties slowed the execution of the work. ===Reorganization=== In December 1854, the \\"International Commission\\" had to meet again to redefine the structure of the \\"Railway track of Central Italy\\" that risked not being able to finish the work undertaken. The following year, projects to reorganize the contract were put forward. The Count and banker Pietro Bastogi, who was involved at the request of Bartolomeo Cini himself, offered to contribute to the financing and to take over the commercial management of the company. The \\"Commission\\" rejected the solution by presenting other candidates. Under pressure from the Austrian Government, the Duke of Galliera became interested in entering the affair and also Paulin Talabot who was closely connected to the Parisian Rothschild house. On 14 March 1856 a new agreement was signed in Vienna with which the Austrian government transferred its Lombardo - Veneto lines to the private company that had been set up with the participation of the aforementioned subjects. ===New company=== On 17 March 1856, the agreement with the Duchies of Parma and Modena, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States was transferred to a new company, the Imperial-regia società privilegiata delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia Centrale. The company was formed with finance from the Rothschild houses in Vienna, Paris and London and the participation of Italian financiers including Pietro Bastogi and the Dukes Lodovico Melzi and Raffaele de Ferrari. It was licensed to finish the Central Apennine Railway (from Piacenza to Pistoia) and the branch to Reggio Emilia for Borgoforte. On 24 May 1856, the concession already granted (16 June 1851) to the Società Anonima per la Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale regarding the Pistoia - Bologna line passed to the new company. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Convenzione fra alcuni Stati italiani per la costruzione della Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale * Silvio Gallio, Oggi è un'ora di viaggio - La costruzione della strada ferrata tra Milano e Bologna, pp. 64–71, Bologna, CLUEB, 2009. . * Italo Briano, Storia delle ferrovie in Italia, vol. 1, Milano, Cavallotti, 1997.

He moved to Spain in 1954, where he began his career as a playwright. While in Spain, Triana studied at the University of Madrid and theatre with José Franco. Triana later joined the troupe Grupo Didi, and worked as a scenic artist for Teatro Ensayo. Most his early plays were inspired by Greek tragedy. Triana wrote his first play, The Major General Will Speak of Theogony, in 1957, and began work on his best known play Night of the Assassins later that year. After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, Triana returned to Cuba. In 1960, Triana's Medea in the Mirror was produced at the Prometeo Theatre. The following year, Triana joined the National Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba as a founding member. In 1965, he was awarded the Casa de las Américas Prize for Night of the Assassins, which he had rewritten earlier that year. The rewritten play won El Gallo of Havana Prize in 1966. International attention resulting from the awards caused supporters of the Cuban Revolution to turn against Triana and his work. He married Chantal Chilhaud-Dumaine (daughter of , Ambassador of France to Portugal) in 1968. Triana and his wife were exiled to France in 1980. In France, Triana adapted Respectable Women, a novel by , into the play Dialogue for Women, eventually retitled Common Words, an homage to the play Divine Words, written by Ramón del Valle-Inclán.

In the 1950s, she became a graphic artist and greeting card designer. She shifted into animation when a Christmas card she had designed got her a job with Gaumont British Animation (later part of the Rank Organisation) in 1948. Starting out as a tracer, she went on to hold nearly every position in animation, including background artist, ink and paint supervisor, rendering supervisor, writer, animator, producer, and director. In the early 1960s, Macaulay and her filmmaker, Jim Macaulay emigrated to the United States. She worked as a freelancer in both the United States and Canada. In 1969, she took a job with Potterton Productions, and in 1973 she was hired full-time by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). She worked on 25 films altogether, including 18 as artist or animator, 10 as producer, 5 as writer, and 1 as director. She won many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the 1978 film Special Delivery, which she cowrote and directed with John Weldon. It also took first prize at Animafest Zagreb. Funded by the NFB, it is a dryly humorous account of what happened after a mailman's unexpected death. It was released in both English and in a French-language version.

The song was released by Republic Records on 7 March 2018 as the second single off the album. In April, Bay performed the song on Late Night with Seth Meyers. ==Music video== The official music video was directed by Phil Andelman and released on 26 March 2018. The clip opens with Bay wearing a sparkling crew neck sweater while he and his band play on an Ed Sullivan Show type of broadcast playing into the living rooms of quiet suburban homes. Bay, who takes on the role as an astronaut trapped on Earth, is seen sneaking into a house's garage late at night to build a rocket ship. The highly anticipated blast off at the end of the video reveals the truth — a young Bay sitting in a “rocket” made out of a silver cardboard box, and the fantasy of escaping our planet vanishes.\\" Bay said “The inspiration behind the video comes from the theme of escape that runs through the song. I was reminded of a time when I was about 4 years old and I told my parents I'd had enough of living with them and would be leaving home.” ==Reception== Rania Aniftos from Rolling Stone called the single “catchy” and a “delicious new rock song”. Jon Blisten, also from Rolling Stone, said \\"\\"Pink Lemonade\\" marks a notable departure from both the stripped- down folk of Bay's debut album, but also the textured electronic sound of Electric Light's lead single, \\"Wild Love\\".

It is the women's section of Deportivo Alavés. ==History== Having begun the process of adding a women's football section to the club structure in the months prior, in summer 2017 Alavés had their new Gloriosas team installed directly into the second tier of the Spanish league setup as the result of a merger with established local club CD Gasteizko Neskak (Vitoria Girls) who had just completed a season competing at that level. Under the agreement, the Gasteizko Neskak senior team's players were adopted by Alavés and now play home matches at the professional club's Ciudad Deportiva José Luis Compañón (Ibaia) training ground, wearing Alavés colours. Dafne Triviño, the long- serving coach and coordinator of Gasteizko Neskak, was appointed as the women's section coordinator for Alavés. During the first season following the merger, the Gloriosas team often continued to be referred to as Gasteizko Neskak. Alavés previously had a women's team, in partnership with Club San Ignacio (not to be confused with SD San Ignacio of Bilbao), from 2010 to 2013. In summer 2019, the club confirmed they would be introducing a women's reserve team in the provincial leagues to act as a step between the youth and senior levels. ===Gasteiz Cup and Gasteizko Neskak=== Gasteiz Cup youth squad members at a tournament in Portugal, 2011 Gasteizko Neskak, who wear pink-and-black and are based at the Betoño Sports Complex (also used by Alavés for training), continue to operate independently, with a second adult team in the Territorial Femenina Araba league (fourth level) as well as their existing youth teams, with support from Alavés as a 'partner club' in exchange for continued access to players. For several years the organisation was known as CDF Gasteiz Cup, with the club hierarchy also arranging an annual youth tournament of the same name which attracted entrants from as far away as India – it was played for 18 years, the last edition held in 2014. After winning the Preferente Álava league in 2010, Gasteiz Cup reached the Primera Nacional (second tier) in the 2010–11 season, finishing bottom of the table in their group. They are regular participants in international youth tournaments such as the Gothia Cup in Sweden. Yulema Corres, who won the Spanish league in 2016 with Athletic Bilbao, began her career with the club. ==Season by season== { valign=\\"top\\" width=0% ===Gasteiz Cup / Gasteizko Neskak=== {  - f0f6fa;\\" !Season !Division !Place !Copa d.l.R. - BF8D5B;\\"2007/08 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial BF8D5B;\\"2nd !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2008/09 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial style=\\"background:gold\\"1st !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2009/10 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial style=\\"background:gold\\"1st !efefef;\\" - style=\\"background:silver;\\"2010/11 style=\\"background:silver;\\"Primera Nacional DC143C;\\"13th !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2011/12 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial BF8D5B;\\"2nd !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2012/13 BF8D5B;\\"Regional BF8D5B;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2013/14 BF8D5B;\\"Regional BF8D5B;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2014/15 BF8D5B;\\"Regional BF8D5B;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2015/16 BF8D5B;\\"Regional style=\\"background:gold\\"1st !efefef;\\" - style=\\"background:silver;\\"2016/17 style=\\"background:silver;\\"2ª style=\\"background:silver;\\"8th !efefef;\\" } valign=\\"top\\" width=0% ===Alavés-San Ignacio / Gloriosas=== {  - f0f6fa;\\" !Season !Division !Place !Copa d.l.R. - BF8D5B;\\"2008/09 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial BF8D5B;\\"2nd !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2009/10 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial BF8D5B;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2010/11 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial BF8D5B;\\"9th !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2011/12 BF8D5B;\\"Provincial style=\\"background:gold;\\"1st !efefef;\\" - BF8D5B;\\"2012/13 BF8D5B;\\"Regional BF8D5B;\\"13th !efefef;\\" - align=center colspan=42013–2017: No participation - style=\\"background:silver;\\"2017/18 style=\\"background:silver;\\"2ª style=\\"background:silver;\\"11th !efefef;\\" - style=\\"background:silver;\\"2018/19 style=\\"background:silver;\\"2ª style=\\"background:silver;\\"2nd !efefef;\\" - style=\\"background:silver;\\"2019/20 style=\\"background:silver;\\"2ªP style=\\"background:silver;\\"5th !efefef;\\" - style=\\"background:silver;\\"2020/21 style=\\"background:silver;\\"2ªP style=\\"background:silver;\\" !efefef;\\" } } ==Honours== CDF Gasteizko Cup :*Álava Territorial League: 2008–09, 2009–10 Alavés-San Ignacio :*Álava Territorial League: 2011–12 Gasteizko Neskak :*Basque Regional League: 2015–16 ==References * Team profile at Futbolme *Alavés at Txapeldunak Category:Women's football clubs in Spain Category:Deportivo Alavés Category:1995 establishments in Spain Category:Football clubs in the Basque Country Category:Sport in Vitoria- Gasteiz ","title":"Deportivo Alavés Gloriosas"},{"id":"56780690","text":"Stephen D.

Schember previously served as a vice president of PNC Bank and as a member of the Erie City Council between 2006 and 2012. On November 7, 2017, the people of Erie voted for the next Mayor and Schember won 53% of the vote to his Republican challenger John Persinger who gained 47% of the vote. The previous Mayor, Joseph E. Sinnott, served for 3 consecutive terms from 2006 to 2018 and ran unopposed in the latest election. Erie was at a decisive moment in its history as under Sinnott, Erie was kept out of Act 47 which is reserved for financially distressed cities. == Early life and education == Joseph Schember was born on November 13, 1950, to the parents of Joseph and Helene Flatley Schember. He has two sisters, Mary Anne and Helene who is a Rocket Scientist with a Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from Cal Tech. In his youth, he attended Catholic School and studied to become a Priest. He left seminary to complete his degree at Gannon University where he met his wife, Rhonda Mahoney. Schember then received a Master's Degree in English at the University of Dayton and taught at Elk County Christian in St. Mary's, Pennsylvania. == Career == He worked for PNC Bank for 40 years, starting as a teller and rising up to the level of Regional Manager of 51 branches for PNC in Northwestern Pennsylvania. === Erie city council, 2006–2012 === Schember served on City Council for six years, and was appointed as chairman of the Finance Committee in 2007. During his tenure, he oversaw the city of Erie move from a bleak financial state of a $12.7 million deficit in the General Fund in late 2005 to a $5 million surplus by 2012. In 2009 and in 2010, the City Council appointed Schember to be president of the City Council. During the Citizens To Be Heard segment of the City Council Meetings, a local activist named Randy Barnes, who was president of an environmental group called Keep Erie's Environment Protected (K.E.E.P.), would continually lodge a conflict of interest complaint against Schember because he had employment with PNC Bank which was doing business with the city of Erie. In response to Randy Barnes complaints that he would lodge at each City Council meeting, Schember resigned May 8, 2012 with a letter that stated that he was \\"troubled by the lack of civility and unprofessionalism that has infected the Citizens To Be Heard segment of City Council Meetings.\\" === Erie mayoral election, 2017 === Out of nine candidates running in the primary race for mayor, two remained in the run-up to the election: Democrat Joe Schember and Republican John Persinger. Republican nominee John Persinger eventually garnering 47% of the popular vote. Persinger emphasized eliminating blight with a campaign promise of \\"1,000 in 1,000 Days\\" initiative to remove 1,000 blightened properties in his first 1,000 days in office. He emphasized the role of broken windows theory, and said that if Erie is to prosper, Erie would need to address blight quickly. === Mayor of Erie === Schember has initiated many changes to the mayoral governance of Erie since being elected into office. He wants to upgrade the technology of Erie, redesign the city of Erie's website, and hire a new digital media coordinator to focus on getting the city up to date with social media which under Sinnott's long mayoralty it lagged behind. Schember hired Erie's first full- time grant writer, Abby Skinner, to work on helping Erie access grant funding from the local, state and federal level. One of Schember's priorities is Erie Refocused, which is part of Erie's Comprehensive Plan to improve the city's economy and society. Skinner will focus on writing grants that will help Erie Refocused move forward. ==References *City of Erie Official Website *City of Erie: Biography of Joseph Schember *Joe Schember on Facebook *Joe Schember on Twitter Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Erie, Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania Democrats Category:Gannon University alumni Category:University of Dayton alumni ","title":"Joe Schember"},{"id":"56780705","text":"Filip Božić (, born 9 March 1999) is a Bosnian-Herzegovinian football midfielder playing with FK Mačva Šabac in the Serbian SuperLiga. ==Club career== Born in Paraćin, Filip Božić played in OFK Beograd academy.An Interview With U-17 Player Filip Bozic at Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina official website, 28-4-2016, retrieved 8-3-2018 Later, in summer 2017, he signed with FK Partizan where he played in the youth team.Filip Bozic at Srbijafudbal.com, retrieved 8-3-2018 During winter-break of the 2017–18 season he signed with FK Mačva Šabac.Filip Bozic profile at Soccerway ==International career== Despite having been born in Paraćin, Serbia, he decided to represent Bosnia and Herzegovina internationally having debuted for their under 17 team in 2016. ==References== Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:People from Paraćin Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina footballers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina expatriate footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:FK Partizan players Category:FK Mačva Šabac players Category:Serbian SuperLiga players ","title":"Filip Božić"},{"id":"56780708","text":"Grace Sartwell Mason (October 31, 1876 — February 1, 1966) was an American journalist, critic, and writer of stories and novels. ==Early life== Grace Sartwell was born in Port Allegany, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Stephen C. and Rose F.

He played college football at Texas and later West Georgia. ==College career== Following his time at Contra Costa College, Harrison was seen as a top recruit after being named to the All-American Community College First Team. Harrison joined the Texas Longhorns for his junior year, but was deemed academically ineligible to play before the season started. This was because Harrison had taken an online course at Brigham Young University during his time at Contra Costa, and BYU's school policy stated that student-athletes from other universities could not receive credit from online courses. The NCAA later cleared Harrison to play. Harrison later missed the entire 2014 season after he was suspended a total of 3 times. He was able to use this as a redshirt year, but he was not able to rejoin the program for the 2015 season. After leaving Texas, he spent two years away from football, and later joined the West Georgia Wolves for the 2017 season. Following his senior season at West Georgia, Harrison was invited to the 2018 Senior Bowl. ==Professional career== At the 2018 NFL combine, Harrison garnered attention after running the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds, the 2nd fastest of any offensive line prospect at the combine. He also recorded an unofficial time of 4.75 seconds. Despite a strong combine, he was not selected in the 2018 NFL Draft. ===Cleveland Browns=== Harrison signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent on May 4, 2018. After an impressive rookie training camp, the Browns named Harrison their starting left tackle on September 7, 2018. Following the Browns' firing of head coach Hue Jackson on October 29, 2018, Harrison was benched by interim head coach Gregg Williams in favor of Greg Robinson. On June 5, 2019, Harrison was waived by the Browns after a missed flight caused him to miss the first day of Cleveland's mandatory mini-camp, deemed to be \\"one too many missteps\\" for Harrison. ===Arizona Cardinals=== On June 6, 2019, Harrison was claimed by the Arizona Cardinals the day after he was waived by the Browns. A month later on July 17, the Cardinals released Harrison following news of assault allegations and a felony arrest warrant in North Carolina. ==References *West Georgia Wolves bio *Texas Longhorns bio *twitter *Cleveland Browns bio Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Houston Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:American football offensive tackles Category:Contra Costa Comets football players Category:West Georgia Wolves football players Category:Texas Longhorns football players Category:Oak Ridge Military Academy alumni Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Arizona Cardinals players ","title":"Desmond Harrison (American football)"},{"id":"56780928","text":"Karastoyanova is a surname.

It is located at 701 Madison Street. The building is currently being used by the Wesley House Community Corporation as a homeless shelter. ==History== Due to the preachings of Bishop Francis Asbury in Chester, a Methodist meeting was formed in 1810 in the home of Mrs. Mary Withey who kept a house of public entertainment known as the Columbia House located at what is now Fifth and Market Streets. The Methodist meetings moved to the home of John Kelley in 1818. Mr. Kelley had previously been a preacher in St. George's Church in Philadelphia. When the services became too large for his home, services were moved to the Chester Court House where Bishop Asbury preached on several occasions. The services soon outgrew the capacity of the Chester Court House and it was decided that a small church should be built. Matthew L. Bevan secured a lot on the corner of Second and Bevan Street and a small chapel named Asbury Chapel was built. Initially there was no regular minister for the Asbury Chapel and the congregation had to rely on circuit riders to preach to them. However, in 1845 the size of the congregation warranted the appointment of a resident pastor and the Reverend Isaac R. Merrill was assigned. The congregation continued to grow under Reverend Merrill and plans for construction of a larger church were initiated. In 1848 a green serpentine stone church was erected on a plot of land on the north side of Fifth Street between Market and Edgemont Avenue. The building was used until 1874. Photo of Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church from H.V. Smith's Chester and Vicinity published in 1914 In 1872, another lot was purchased on the northeast corner of Seventh and Madison Streets and construction was initiated. On July 17, 1874 the Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church was dedicated and opened for worship. David Reese Esrey, the cotton goods manufacturer and banker, was president of the Board of Trustees of the Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church and contributed liberally to the construction of the church. On June 19, 1983, the Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church congregation merged with the Christ United Methodist Church located at 600 Dutton Mill Road in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania. The former Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church is currently being used by the Wesley House Community corporation as a homeless shelter for families and single women. The facility has 17 rooms and provides shelter to over 240 individuals/75 households each year. == References  * Category:1872 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:19th-century Methodist church buildings in the United States Category:Chester, Pennsylvania Category:Churches in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Category:Homeless shelters in the United States Category:Religious organizations established in 1872 ","title":"Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church"},{"id":"56781120","text":"Dog Days is a 2018 American romantic comedy film directed by Ken Marino and written by Elissa Matsueda and Erica Oyama.

Tara, who is crazy about the friendly but full of himself vet Dr. Mike, one day meets Garrett, the eccentric and shy owner of an animal care center who is unable to tell Tara that he loves her. Grace and Kurt are a married couple struggling to properly prepare for their adoptive daughter, Amelia, to arrive. When she moves in, she doesn't seem happy with her new home and her new parents. Dax is a teen in the body of adult, and leader of the aspiring rock band Frunk, who after a visit to his pregnant sister Ruth and her husband Greg, is forced to take care of Ruth's dog, despite his building not allowing dogs. Finally Walter, an aging, lonely widower, loses his dog when it escapes and runs off. Tyler, his regular pizza delivery driver unexpectedly offers to help find her. As time moves on, things become more complicated: Elizabeth and Jimmy start to feel attracted to each other, making their work more difficult. After they've been dating for some time, Elizabeth finds out (from her makeup artist) that Jimmy has been offered a position hosting a show on another channel. Tara accepts Garrett’s offer to work as volunteer in his animal care center at the same time she starts to date Dr. Mike; meanwhile Garrett learns that the owner of the building has sold it and he'll lose the center. Amelia finds Walter's dog, which makes her happy, but Grace and Kurt fear that one day Amelia will lose her new friend if the owner appears; Dax is caring for Ruth's dog, although eventually it starts to put order in his life, even as it creates trouble to hide it from his neighbors. Walter begins helping Tyler with his academic studies in exchange for help finding his dog. Jimmy's has to put his dog Brandy down after she suffers a stroke.

Fylling was born at the Fylling farm in Skodje in Norway's Sunnmøre region, the son of John Fylling and Ragnhild Sorte. His father was interested in history and he passed along both his knowledge and this interest to his son. Fylling read books that he borrowed from the priests in the district and from the Daae family at the Solnør farm. Because of sickness, Fylling gave up his right to the farm in Skodje and dedicated himself to historical studies instead. He tirelessly traveled around the district, looking for old items, antiquities, folk poetry, old documents, and letters. Fylling sent his own manuscripts to the museum in Bergen, where he also sent old items and ancient artifacts that he found in the district. In mid-June 1862, Henrik Ibsen arrived in Sunnmøre with a grant from the Collegium Academicum, the governing body at Royal Frederick University, to collect legends and folk tales. He stayed with Ludvig Daae at the Solnør farm, and it was probably Daae that who put Ibsen in touch with Peder Fylling. Ibsen's travel journal ends with his arrival at Sjøholt on July 17, 1862, after which he wrote the heading \\"Stories told by Peder Fylling\\" (Sagn fortalte af Peder Fylling). The material leaves no doubt that Ibsen obtained what he was looking for from Fylling. Fylling spent three days talking to Ibsen, who wrote down a series of legends and a few folk tales. Ibsen published four of the legends in the magazine Illustreret Nyhedsblad in the fall of 1862. Magdalene Thoresen, Ibsen's mother-in-law, had also met Peder Fylling. Thoresen used the stories that she heard from Fylling in her volume Billeder fra Vestkysten af Norge (Pictures from the West Coast of Norway, 1872). The folk material collector Thrond Sjursen Haukenæs also visited Fylling at his home in Skodje. Haukenæs wrote the following about Fylling's work: \\"May many more appreciate Peder Fylling's activities, and may this often be carried out by men from the peasantry who ought to possess his investigative spirit for the benefit of the country and its people.\\" Fylling himself published the volume Folkesagn samlede paa Søndmør 1ste Del (Folk Material Gathered in Sunnmøre, Part 1) in 1874. The second part was published in 1877, and the last part in 1942, 52 years after his death. Fylling mostly wrote in a rigid Riksmål form that was far from his own dialect, and only once did he write in his local dialect. He also did not have much contact with the work of his contemporary Ivar Aasen, who lived with the Daae family at Solnør for seven years. Fylling died at the Fylling farm. == Bibliography == * Historisk-antikvariske Bemærkninger over Borgunds Præstegjeld paa Søndmøre (Historical and Antiquarian Observations on the Parish of Borgund in Sunnmøre).

He was lynched for having given Christmas cards to all his co-workers at the Van Priest Dime Store, including Cynthia Goff, a white girl, followed by a letter to her on New Year's Day: > Dear Friend, > Just a few line[s] to let you hear from me [.] I am well an[d] hope you are > the same.

Sincerely yours, with, [sic] > From Y.K.W. > Fo[r] Cynthia Goff > I love your name. I love your voice, for a S.H. [sweetheart] you are my > choice. Cynthia was offended by the card and letter, and gave them to her father, A.P. \\"Phil\\" Goff, the Live Oak Postmaster and a former state legislator. Goff, along with S. B. McCullers and Reg H. Scott, allegedly went to Willie's house and took the youth from his mother at gunpoint. They picked up Willie's father, James Howard, at the Bond-Howell Lumber Company where he worked, then drove to the Suwannee River east of Suwannee Springs, where they bound Willie by the hands and feet, and forced the youth to choose between getting shot and jumping into the Suwannee River. After his father said he could do nothing to save him, Willie jumped into the river and drowned. Goff, McCullers and Scott signed an affidavit which stated that they had only wanted James Howard to whip his son and, rather than be whipped by his father, Willie had committed suicide by jumping into the river. James Howard also signed the affidavit, but after selling his home and moving to Orlando, he recanted. Harry T. Moore, of the NAACP, interviewed the parents. After a county grand jury failed to indict, Moore was able to get a federal investigation started, but no convictions followed. Goff, McCullers and Scott died without having to face murder charges. A documentary film on the murder, Murder on the Suwannee River, was produced in 2006 by Marvin Dunn, a historian, who tried to get Charlie Crist, then attorney general and later governor of Florida, to reopen the case, but to no avail; neither was his case investigated under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. It is frequently cited as comparable to the case of Emmett Till, who was also lynched (at age 14) for allegedly making advances at a white woman at a grocery store. Tameka Hobbs wrote about the lynching and three other lynchings in her 2015 book Democracy Abroad, Lynching at Home: Racial Violence in Florida. ==References *\\"Willie James Howard\\" *\\"Willie James Howard Lynching\\" Category:1944 deaths Category:1944 murders in the United States Category:1944 in Florida Category:January 1944 events Category:Lynching deaths in Florida Category:History of Suwannee County, Florida Category:Unsolved murders in the United States Category:People from Live Oak, Florida Category:1928 births ","title":"Lynching of Willie James Howard"},{"id":"56781460","text":"Artaxa digramma is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1844.

Her interest in photography began when one of her brothers gave her a \\"Little Nipper\\" camera. Originally employed to \\"keep house\\" in her brothers' surgery, Neill qualified as a dentist herself and replaced her brother Bob in the practice when he left to serve in the army during the First World War. Many of her dental patients at the time were from the large army camp nearby, and in 1918, she met Ernest Chinnery (known as Pearson Chinnery or \\"Chin\\")–an Australian observer lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps. They married in April 1919, and lived in Cambridge where Pearson Chinnery studied and lectured in anthropology at Cambridge University. ==New Guinea== Pearson received a grant from the Royal Geographical Society in 1920, and the couple moved to Melbourne, Australia later that year while they considered moving to New Guinea where Pearson had previously served as a magistrate. He moved there later in the year as director of native labour for New Guinea Copper Mines, with Sarah joining him in Port Moresby in 1921. In 1924, Pearson was appointed government anthropologist of the Territory of New Guinea, and they moved to Rabaul. One of Chinnery's photographs from New Guinea The Chinnerys spent sixteen years in New Guinea, where Sarah regularly took solo trips around the territory to take photographs of the landscape and the indigenous people. Unlike most ethnographic photography of the time, Chinnery's photographs were not staged and were respectful depictions of local residents in their daily lives. Chinnery did not exhibit her work during her lifetime, but her photographs were published in several of Australia's major newspapers, along with articles and anecdotes written by her. In March 1935, she produced a three-page article and photo spread for the weekend magazine of The New York Times. In addition to her photographic work, Chinnery kept extensive diaries of her time in New Guinea and Papua. She began to rewrite her diaries as a book in the mid-1930s, but abandoned this work after the 1937 volcanic eruption in Rabaul, after which she returned to Australia. Her manuscripts were typed up by her four daughters and donated to the National Library of Australia, which published them in 1998 as Malaguna Road: The Papua and New Guinea Diaries of Sarah Chinnery, edited by Kate Fortune. ==Later life== Chinnery died at Sandringham Hospital in Melbourne on 24 March 1970, aged 83. She was survived by her husband (who died in 1972), and their four daughters. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Australian women photographers Category:Women photographers from Northern Ireland Category:British dentists Category:Northern Ireland emigrants to Australia Category:Australian expatriates in Papua New Guinea Category:British expatriates in Papua New Guinea ","title":"Sarah Chinnery"},{"id":"56781502","text":"Thiri Yadanar (; born on 12 September 1979) is a Burmese politician who currently serves as a member of parliament in the House of Nationalities for Mon State № 12 constituency.

In February 2002, the Scottish FA and the FA of Ireland officially confirmed a joint bid for Scotland and the Republic of Ireland to host the 2008 UEFA European Championships. Had the bid been successful, it would have been the first major competition hosted by both nations and the first held on the British Isles since UEFA Euro 1996, hosted by England. By the conclusion of the bidding process, Scotland had hosted three major international tournaments at youth level, the 1970 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, the 1989 FIFA U-16 World Championship and the 1998 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, as well as three UEFA Champions League finals and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final. Ireland had no experience in hosting international football tournaments at any level, although they hosted matches in the Rugby World Cup in 1991 and 1999 along with Scotland and the other Five Nations countries. ==History== Prior to the official announcement of the bid between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, the Scottish FA refused to rule- out a four-way Celtic bid consisting Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland. This four-way proposal never came to fruition. In the summer of 2000, the FAI chief executive Bernard O’Byrne held an exploratory meeting with his counterparts from the SFA, Irish Football Association and Football Association of Wales regarding the possibility of a four-way Celtic bid for Euro 2008. In July 2000, SFA chief executive David Taylor announced that Scotland would bid to host the European Championships in 2008, with the preference of the Scottish FA at the time being for Scotland to host the tournament of its own. However, Taylor noted \\"if we have to broaden it out and talk to other nations, we would.\\" At the same time, Taylor announced the bid would enhance if England failed to the secure hosting rights for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. On 6 July 2000, England was eliminated from the second round of voting for the host of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was ultimately won by Germany. In May 2001, the SFA and the Scottish Executive gave their support, in principle, to Scotland hosting the European Championships after a report said there were no \\"insurmountable\\" problems, with Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish pledging the full backing of the Executive to a bid by Scotland on its own. McLeish resigned from his position as First Minister in November 2001, amid a scandal involving allegations that he sublet part of his Westminster constituency office without declaring the income from the sublets when he claimed his office expenses. The new First Minister Jack McConnell withdrew support for a solo Scottish bid, favouring a joint bid with Ireland following UEFA's decision to require eight stadia from the host country, rather than the previous six. The proposal for a joint bid between Scotland and Ireland was approved by the FAI and, on 27 February 2002, a letter was sent to UEFA announcing the Irish and Scottish intention to bid for the tournament. On 29 May, the bidding team sent a document detailing their proposals for hosting the competition to UEFA. On 15 May 2002, Hampden Park in Glasgow hosted the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final between Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid, with an estimated £15 million boost for the local economy. Organisers of the final believed that the showcase final could help the bid to host the 2008 European Championships. Simon Lyons, marketing director for the bid, noted that Scotland and Ireland offered the most seats of any bid, 1.7 million, at the eight stadia which would be used, with the four-way Nordic bid being the closest to this with 1.2 million seats. Lyons also noted the friendly atmosphere from both Ireland and Scotland fans in recent tournaments and the passion for football in both nations as another reason for UEFA to support the bid. On 16 September 2002, UEFA's inspectors began their five-day visit to the bidding countries. It was reported that Croke Park had been identified as a potential UEFA Champions League final venue as a result of the inspection, should the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) abolish Rule 42 of their constitution preventing competitor sports to Gaelic sports to be played at the stadium. The, then new, GAA president Sean Kelly appeared to favour softening the organisations regulations for the tournament. UEFA's technical report gave the Scotland–Ireland bid a score of 94%, a percentage point lower than the Austria–Switzerland bid which had the best technical report. On 12 December 2002, UEFA awarded the Championships to Austria and Switzerland, with UEFA's national team committee putting forward Austria-Switzerland, Greece- Turkey, Hungary and the four-way Nordic bid as their recommendations of the four best bids ahead of the final vote. The Scotland–Ireland bid came fourth overall in the final vote. ==Venues== Bidding nations were required to provide eight stadia to be used for the tournament. The bid consisted of ten potential stadia within six locations, which would be reduced to eight for the final competition. Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dublin all had multiple stadia within their cities that could have been used for the tournament. The bid included using the three major football stadia in Glasgow - each requiring little modification due to recent renovations. Ibrox, the home of Rangers, had been rebuilt in between 1978 and 1981 in response to the 1971 Ibrox disaster, replacing the historic ground with a state-of-the-art all-seater stadium. Further renovations took place in 90s to expand the stadium to over 50,000 seats. The Taylor Report, into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, made redevelopment of Glasgow's two other major football stadia necessary to comply with new ground regulations. Celtic Park, owned by Celtic, was completely rebuilt over a four period from 1994 to 1998, making it the largest club ground in the whole UK at the time of completion. Hampden Park was the national football stadium in Scotland and had been re-developed in a number of stages across the 90s. The final phase was completed in 1999, with the 1999 Scottish Cup Final being the first match at the ground since the completion of the project. Two stadia in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh, were earmarked for the bid. Murrayfield, the national rugby union ground, had also gone through major re-development in the 1990s, becoming the largest stadium in Scotland in the process. Easter Road underwent work in the previous decade, but would have required expansion to comply with the requirements to host European Championship matches - UEFA sets the minimum capacity for venues at 30,000. The East Stand would have been replaced by a new three-tier stand to double the capacity of the stadium. Aberdeen and Dundee would have potentially seen new stadia to replace the existing grounds in the two cities. Aberdeen's Pittodrie Stadium would have been replaced with a 31,400 seat stadium as part of a modern leisure park on the outskirts of the city, which would incorporate a football academy. The football club would move into the new stadium following the completion of the tournament. The new stadium in Dundee would replace two existing stadia in the city: Dens Park, owned by Dundee, and Tannadice Park, owned by Dundee United. Both football clubs would share the stadium, a rarity for professional football in the UK, with the Scottish Claymores American football team relocating from Hampden Park in order to play matches at the new stadium. The ground would feature a retractable roof. Only two of the three of a renovated Easter Road and the new stadia in Aberdeen and Dundee would have been used as part of the bid, with the three Glasgow stadia and Murrayfield being confirmed stadia by the conclusion of the bidding process. Three stadia were included as potential venues within the Republic of Ireland, while only two would be used. The Gaelic Athletic Association's (GAA) Croke Park, in Dublin, was the biggest stadium in Ireland and had been going through extensive renovation at the time of the bid, being completed in 2004. The stadium hosted the finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, in Gaelic football, and the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. A major sticking point of using Croke Park was the GAA's rules on allowing 'foreign' sports to take place at the ground. The GAA constitution, up until 1971, had been stricter, however, stating a member of the organisation could be banned from competing in Gaelic sports if found to be also playing association football, rugby or cricket. The years following the conclusion of the bid, the GAA allowed both the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union to play their respective sports at the stadium during the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road. Proposals to erect a new stadium in Abbotstown, Castleknock were also made, with most of the funding coming from the Irish Government. The stadium, called Stadium Ireland, was viewed to be central to the Irish part of the bid, but plans to construct the ground were aborted despite over €500 million (£315m) being spent on the project. The Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat centre-right coalition in Ireland had made major spending cuts in the country prior to UEFA's vote on hosting the Championships, which was considered the primary reason for the plug being pulled on the project. Had the stadium been built, it was envisioned that it would have become the home of the Irish national football and rugby union teams, as well as a national stadium for Gaelic games within Ireland. Dublin's Lansdowne Road was also part of the proposals that would've seen the stadium redeveloped had the Stadium Ireland project collapsed. The stadium was owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), with an all-seated capacity of 36,000, requiring the use of temporary seating to reach this figure due to the presence of terracing within the stadium. There were 23,000 permanent seats in the stadium. In the years following the bid, the stadium was replaced by the 51,700 seat Aviva Stadium, partially built with money initially planned to go Stadium Ireland project. The IRFU and the FAI contributed money towards the project, as well. The new stadium opened in 2010. SFA's chief executive David Taylor said that the bid envisioned Scotland hosting the opening match, three group stages, three quarter finals, one semi final and the final match, with the Republic of Ireland staging one group phase, one quarter final and one semi final. The final bid saw changes to the initial plan with stadia in Scotland hosting both semi-finals, as well as the final. Murrayfield would be the final venue, with Hampden and Celtic Park each hosting a semi-final match. ===List of venues=== The following venues would have been used for the finals: { width=\\"100%\\"   - ! width=150px  Image ! width=150px  Stadium ! width=100px  City ! width=75px  Current capacity ! width=75px  Planned capacity ! width=100px  Owner ! width=250px  Use ! width=200px  Notes -  150px  Murrayfield Stadium  Edinburgh,  67,200  67,200  Scottish Rugby Union  Scottish national rugby union team, Edinburgh Rugby  Proposed final venue -  150px  Celtic Park  Glasgow,  60,832  60,832  Celtic Football Club  Celtic  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Proposed semi-final venue -  150px  Hampden Park  Glasgow,  52,063  52,063  Queen's Park Football Club  Queen's Park, Scotland national football team -  150px  Ibrox Stadium  Glasgow,  51,082  51,082  Rangers Football Club  Rangers  -  150px  Easter Road  Edinburgh,  20,421  34,880  Hibernian Football Club  Hibernian rowspan=\\"3\\"Two out of three stadia out of Easter Road and the new stadia in Aberdeen and Dundee would have been used. -   New Aberdeen Stadium  Aberdeen,  new  31,400  Aberdeen Football Club  Future home of Aberdeen -   New Dundee Stadium  Dundee,  new  31,400  unknown  Future home of Dundee, Dundee United, Scottish Claymores -  150px  Croke Park  Dublin,  82,300  82,300  Gaelic Athletics Association  Various Gaelic sports matches rowspan=\\"3\\"Two out of three stadia out of Croke Park, Lansdowne Road and Stadium Ireland would have been used. -   Stadium Ireland  Abbotstown, Castleknock,  new  80,000  unknown  Future home of Ireland national rugby union team, Republic of Ireland national football team -  150px  Lansdowne Road  Dublin,  36,000  51,700  Irish Rugby Football Union  Ireland national rugby union team, Republic of Ireland national football team, Leinster Rugby } ==Aftermath== Commentators and bid officials attempted to seek reasons for why the bid failed. Cited reasons included the issue of having three stadia within the city of Glasgow, the uncertainty over whether Ireland could provide two suitable stadia for the competition, the lack of time between Euro 2008 and the previous major competition hosted in the British Isles, political voting within UEFA, a persevered lack of unity within the Irish Government, the financial visibility of the bid and adverse media coverage within Scotland regarding the bid. UEFA's President Lennart Johansson and chief executive Gerhard Aigner claimed that the presence of Ireland within the bid and the issue regarding which stadia would be used in Ireland were not factors in the rejection of the bid. Johansson, who wasn't able to vote until the Nordic bid was eliminated from voting, stated that he was shocked that the bid did not progress beyond the first round of voting, insisting that he would have voted for the bid had he been able to vote. He also suggested that FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who defeated Johansson in the 1998 FIFA presidential election, may have had an involvement in ensuring that the Austria–Switzerland bid won. It was reviled in documents realised by in 2018, that the Scottish Executive's Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport Mike Watson claimed in a cabinet meeting that the bid was \\"as good as the winning bid\\", while suggesting that \\"the Republic of Ireland was unable to meet their end of the bargain\\". He told the cabinet that the £500,000 spent by the Executive on the bid was not wasted and useful lessons had been learned from the bid process. Some of the Scottish media claimed that the Irish Government were being caught up in electoral issues ahead of the 2002 Irish general election held in the May prior to the UEFA vote, which negatively impacted on Ireland's ability to make firm commitments over stadia and funding. ===UEFA Euro 2016=== On 14 March 2006, UEFA's president Johannsen said that Ireland, Scotland and Wales should consider a three-way bid for UEFA Euro 2016. Later in the month, Scottish FA chief executive David Taylor said that they wouldn't proceed with a three-way bid, but didn't rule out a bid involving Scotland for the tournament. In December 2006, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) announced it was tentatively considering the possibility of jointly hosting the tournament, with the Scottish Football Association. There was discussion over whether Scotland should consider a solo bid for Euro 2016. The election of a Scottish National Party government, in May 2007, enhanced the chances of a bid for Euro 2016. Comments by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond suggested that a Scotland–Wales bid may be considered, but a solo Scotland bid would be preferential if logistically possible. In November 2007, Salmond announced that a feasibility study would take place. In June 2008, both Salmond and Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan became supportive of a joint Scotland–Wales bid, particularly when the increase in size of the tournament, from sixteen countries to twenty-four, was announced. The FAW confirmed, that month, that it had held talks with the Scottish FA regarding a joint bid for Euro 2016. FAW secretary David Collins pointed to the new stadia being built in Wales at the time as a reason for Wales to be involved in a bid. In December 2008, it was reported that Irish Football Association, from Northern Ireland, would be involved in talks, along with the Scottish and Welsh Football Associations over co-hosting the tournament in 2016. On 1 March 2009, Scotland and Wales officially cancelled their plans to host the competition owing to the economic downturn. The Welsh Deputy First Minister and Minister for the Economy and Transport Ieuan Wyn Jones stated that the money required to host the event was excessive. \\"The cost of bringing other venues up to this standard would run into tens of millions of pounds. In the current economic and financial climate, this is unaffordable.\\" The tournament was ultimately hosted in France, after their bid defeated competition from Italy and Turkey. ===UEFA Euro 2020=== Scotland and Ireland were both involved in a short-lived bid, with Wales, for UEFA Euro 2020. On 15 May 2012, the three countries officially announced their declared an interest in bidding for the tournament. Football Association of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford said that the declaration of interest doesn't commit the nations to a bid: \\"It is not a bid, it's a declaration of interest and that will allow us to obtain the information from Uefa so that we can fully assess and determine, independently and together, whether we should submit a bid.\\" In May 2012, UEFA announced that the competition would be held in multiple stadia across Europe, rather than in a single, or multiple, host countries, opening the possibility of Euro 2020 matches being hosted in the Celtic nations. Ireland proposed that the newly built Aviva Stadium, the replacement of Lansdowne Road, could host matches, while Scotland put forward Hampden Park as a potential venue. On 19 September 2014, UEFA announced that Dublin, Ireland and Glasgow, Scotland would be host cities for the 2020 European Championships, with the two cities hosting three group games and a round of sixteen match each. Wales, who was initially involved in the Celtic bid for Euro 2020, failed in their bid to bring Euro 2020 matches to Cardiff. The tournament will take place in twelve cities in twelve different countries. ==References== Category:UEFA Euro 2008 Category:UEFA European Championship bids Category:Republic of Ireland at the UEFA European Championship Category:Scotland at the UEFA European Championship ","title":"Scotland–Ireland Euro 2008 bid"},{"id":"56781623","text":"Artaxa vitellina is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Vincenz Kollar in 1848.

Philip’s Prophesying Daughters. ==Biblical account== They were daughters of Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven Greek-speaking Jewish men, including Stephen who were appointed deacons to the Greek-speaking Jewish widows in the Jerusalem church. Acts 6:1-6; 21:8). He became an evangelist travelling throughout the Holy Land. By the end of account in Acts he was living in Caesarea Philippi where he had four daughters.Acts 21:9. The Bible tells us only that > The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of > Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him. 9 He had four > unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.Acts of the Apostles > 21.8-9. ==Extra-biblical references== Further details of these women are given in various early histories including Eusebius and Papius. It is possible that they were informants for both Luke in their youth and the early Christian historian Papias in their latter years.Philip's Prophetess Daughters. Eusebius quoting Papias tells us that two daughters remained with Philip in his old age, when he had moved to the Phrygian city of Hierapolis and even relates a tale where one was miraculously rose from the dead.”Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 3.39.9. Eusebius' source for these tales was Papias, who he extensively quoted, and who was a young Bishop of Hierapolis. Church History (Book 3:36:2. It is plausible that Papias knew these women.Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 22 Sep. 2008) p18. Eusebius held the women as examples of the right living Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 5.17.3. and refers to them as “great lights” or “mighty luminaries” Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 3.31.3. People would travel long distances to consult them. F.F. Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1951), p387. Furthermore, Eusebius regarded Philip’s daughters and their ministry as the benchmark for prophetic ministry in the early church. A later Greek Menaon,Debra Moody Bass, The Female Prophets of the Bible: Who Were They, and What Did They Have to Say?(WestBow Press, 2018). an annual calendar equivalent to a Catholic missal, which preserves the memory of martyrs and saints, claims that two of the daughters were called Hermione and Eutychis. Hermione and her sister Eutychis travelled to Ephesus. An early vita of Hermione also survives, and recounts much of her life. ==Burial place== Tradition says that two daughters, Irais and Chariline, were buried in Hierapolis.Monte A. Shanks, Papias and the New Testament (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2013) p295. Eusebius writes “After him there were four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip, at Hierapolis in Asia. Their tomb is there and the tomb of their father.”Eucibius, Church History (Book 3:31:4. Other sources however, say all four were buried in Caesarea.

As of 2018, the facilities for 11-a-side football consisted of three full-size grass pitches (one with a basic covered and seated stand for around 188 spectators) and one artificial turf pitch, and associated changing areas. ==History of the site== Stand at Betoño, 2015 The 17,000m² complex was originally the recreation grounds of the Michelin tyre company who have a large factory in the area; their other factory in Lasarte- Oria had a football team which reached the Spanish third tier in the 1970s. The facilities were used extensively by Deportivo Alavés for many years before being purchased by the club, upgraded and renamed El Glorioso ('The Glorious', referencing one of their nicknames) in 2001. Betoño became the home ground for the Alavés B-team and C-team who at that time were competing in the third and fourth tiers of the Spanish football league system. However, the club's fortunes declined rapidly under the ownership of Dmitry Piterman, with the senior team falling to the third level, the B-team to the fifth and the C-team disbanding, and in 2006 Vitoria-Gasteiz city council reacquired control of the facility. Since then, many smaller teams have trained regularly or played their home fixtures there, including CD Betoño-Elgorriaga, Gasteizko Neskak (a women's club whose senior squad was merged into a new Alavés female team in 2017) and, until 2015, CD Vitoria. As of 2016–17, the various age group teams of Alavés have been holding training sessions at Betoño, having secured a deal for the exclusive use of one of the pitches, although the club also has a dedicated training facility of a similar size, Ciudad Deportiva José Luis Compañón (also known by its location, 'Ibaia'), to the south-west of the city. ==Future developments== Since becoming owner of Alavés in 2013, Josean Querejeta forged close links between the football club and his basketball team Saski Baskonia including a joint training initiative for children (5+11 Foundation). He also stated his desire for Alavés to have an elite training facility, and this became a more urgent concern when the team were promoted to La Liga in 2016. The proximity of the Betoño grounds to Baskonia's :Fernando Buesa Arena and BAKH multi-sports centre led to it being the preferred site to be developed, ahead of Ibaia which has only basic facilities and is located at an isolated site on the other side of the city. However, if Alavés were to take back full exclusive control of Betoño, the local teams based there would be without a home ground close to them. The higher land value of Betoño and its importance to amateur football in the city were considerable obstacles in the club's proposals to re-acquire ownership of the complex. As part of a wider project involving a €50 million investment in the Alavés infrastructure and stadium jointly financed between the club and public bodies, in summer 2017 an agreement in principle over the purchase of Betoño, involving an annual fee to the city until 2020 when a land purchase fee of €6 million would be paid, accompanied by a proposal for the local teams to have use of Ibaia for their matches, appeared to have been reached in summer 2017, but some months later this became less certain when the price of the land involved, including the former Michelin factory adjacent to the sports complex, was set at €16 million by the city council, prompting Alavés to release an alternative plan to purchase farmland to the east of the Buesa Arena, outside the city limits of Vitoria-Gasteiz. == References  External links == Category:Football venues in the Basque Country Category:Deportivo Alavés Category:Association football training grounds in Spain Category:Buildings and structures in Álava Category:Sports venues completed in 1970 ","title":"Betoño Sports Complex"},{"id":"56781903","text":"The Battle of Landing Zone Center (also known as the Battle of Hill 352 or the Battle of Nui Hoac Ridge) took place from 5–25 May 1968 in Quảng Tín Province during the Vietnam War. ==Background== During the Tet Offensive of 1968, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Division tried to capture Đà Nẵng but they were defeated in the Battle of Lo Giang. PAVN General Chu Huy Mân Commander of Military Region 5 ordered General Giáp Văn Cương, commander of the 2nd Division, to split the Division into two fighting arms: one regiment would tie down the Americans in the Quế Son Valley, while the rest of the Division would withdraw to their base areas near Laos, to link up with the 70th Transport Regiment and rest and refit. Then, their next target would be Khâm Đức, the last remaining Special Forces camp adjacent to the Ho Chi Minh Trail in I Corps. Mân told his senior officers that they would attack Khâm Đức to force an American retreat from the area. In the aftermath of the battle for Đà Nẵng, U.S. military commanders in I Corps held different views on the fighting ability of the PAVN 2nd Division. Americal Division commander Major-General Samuel W. Koster claimed losses sustained by the Division had \\"impaired its future effectiveness\\", after his units killed more than 1,000 enemy soldiers in the month of January alone. In contrast, 1st Marine Division commander Major-General Donn J. Robertson told his superiors that the 2nd Division may have several uncommitted units they could deploy for future operations. ==Battle== Landing Zone Center () was located on Hill 348, approximately 20km northwest of Tam Kỳ. In early May 1968 it was occupied by 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment and Battery B, 3rd Battalion, 82nd Artillery Regiment. On 5 May as part of the May Offensive, the PAVN 31st Regiment attacked LZ Center with mortars and recoilless rifles. When U.S. helicopters tried to land a patrol to locate those weapons, a heavy machine gun company from the PAVN K31 Anti-Aircraft Battalion opened fire from positions around the firebase, shooting down UH-1D #66-17075 from the 178th Assault Helicopter Company which crashed killing all 10 crew and passengers and shortly afterwards a helicopter gunship of the 71st Assault Helicopter Company was also shot down. Company D 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment was flown in to reinforce LZ Center. On 7 May an A–1E Skyraider was shot down while providing air support near LZ Center. On 8 May MG Koster ordered the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment to sweep the hills around Landing Zone Center. The PAVN forces were concentrated on the Nui Hoac Ridge, with their main position located on Hill 352 () approximately 2.5km south of LZ Center. This position held at least 2 anti-aircraft guns, recoilless rifles, mortars and an unknown number of PAVN. In addition the PAVN were entrenched between Hills 434 and 479 to the east of LZ Center. On 14 May 1968 during an attack on PAVN bunkers on Hill 352 Platoon sergeant Finnis D. McCleery of 1st Platoon, Company A, 1/6th Infantry single-handedly attacked and destroyed several PAVN bunkers despite being wounded twice. For his actions that day, McCleery would be awarded the Medal of Honor. ==Aftermath== The battle was a U.S. victory with the US claiming over 365 PAVN were killed, however it diverted U.S. resources away from the Battle of Kham Duc. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1968 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:May 1968 events Category:History of Quảng Nam Province ","title":"Battle of Landing Zone Center"},{"id":"56781957","text":"311x311px Mesopotamian mythology refers to the myths, religious texts, and other literature that comes from the region of ancient Mesopotamia in modern- day West Asia. In particular the societies of Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria, all of which existed shortly after 3000 BCE and were mostly gone by 400 CE. These works were primarily preserved on stone or clay tablets and were written in cuneiform by scribes. Several lengthy pieces have survived, some of which are considered the oldest stories in the world, and have given historians insight into Mesopotamian ideology and cosmology. == Creation Myths == There are many different accounts of the creation of the earth from the Mesopotamian region. This is because of the many different cultures in the area and the shifts in narratives that are common in ancient cultures due to their reliance on word of mouth to transmit stories. These myths can share related themes, but the chronology of events vary based on when or where the story was written down. === Atra-Hasis === See main article: Atra-Hasis Atra-Hasis refers both to one of the Mesopotamian myths focusing on the earth’s creation, and also the main character of that myth. The myth possibly has Assyrian roots, as a fragmented version may have been found in the library of Ashusbanipal, though translations remain unsure. Its most complete surviving version was recorded in Akkadian. The myth begins with humans being created by the mother goddess Mami to lighten the gods' workload. She made them out of a mixture of clay, flesh, and blood from a slain god. Later in the story though, the god Enlil attempts to control overpopulation of humans through various methods, including famine, drought, and finally, a great flood. Humankind is saved by Atrahasis, who was warned of the flood by the god Enki and built a boat to escape the waters, eventually placating the gods with sacrifices. === Eridu Genesis === See main article: Sumerian Creation Myth Eridu Genesis has a similar plot to that of the Akkadian myth, Atra-Hasis, though it is harder to tell what happens exactly in Eridu Genesis because the tablet upon which it was recorded is badly damaged. The two stories share the flood as the major event however, although the hero who survives in Eridu Genesis is called Zi- ud-sura instead of Artahasis. Eridu Genesis was recorded around the same time as Atra-Hasis, however the fragmented tablet that held it was found in Nippur, located in modern-day east Iraq, while the version of Atra-hasis that came from the same time was found in the library of Ashurbanipal, in modern-day north Iraq. === Enuma Elish === See main article: Enuma Elis Enuma Elis (also spelled Enuma Elish) is a Babylonian creation myth with an unclear composition, though it possibly dates back to the Bronze Age. This piece was thought to be recited in a ritual celebration of the Babylonian new year. It chronicles the birth of the gods, the world, and man, whose purpose was to serve the gods and lighten their work load. The focus of the narrative is on praising Marduk, the patron god of Babylon, who creates the world, the calendar, and humanity. == Heroic epics == These stories tended to focus on a great hero, following their journey through trials or simply important events in their life. Stories like these can be found in many different cultures around the world, and often give insight into the values of those societies. For example, in a culture that celebrated a hero that was devout to the gods or respecting their father, it can be inferred that the society valued those traits. === Epic of Gilgamesh === The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the most well known Mesopotamian myths, and is often regarded as the oldest known piece of literature in the world. It was initially a number of individual short stories, and was not combined into one cohesive epic until the 18th century. The story follows the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, typically regarded as a historical figure, and his good friend, Enkidu through various adventures and quests that eventually lead to Enkidu's death. The second half of the epic deal with Gilgamesh, distressed about the death of his friend and his own impending mortality, as he searches for immortality. In the end he fails, but he comes to terms with the fact that he is eventually going to die and returns to his city of Uruk a wiser king. === The Myth of Adapa === The earliest record of myth of Adapa is from the 14th century BC. Adapa was a Sumerian citizen who was blessed by the god Enki with immeasurable intelligence. However, one day Adapa was knocked into the sea by the south wind, and in a rage he broke the south wind’s wings so that it could no longer blow. Adapa was summoned to be judged by An, and before he left Enki warned him not to eat or drink anything offered to him. However, An had a change of heart when he realized just how smart Adapa was, and offered him the food of immortality, which Adapa, dutiful to Enki, turned down. This story is used as an explanation for humankind’s mortality, it is associated with the fall of man narrative that is also present in Christianity. == Common themes == Immortality is a constant goal of the characters in Mesopotamian epics. No matter the version of the story, the man who survives the flood, whether Atrahasis, Zi-ud-sura, or Utnapishtim, is granted immortality by the gods. This character then makes a reappearance in the Epic of Gilgamesh, when Gilgamesh is searching for immortality after coming to fear death and the underworld after hearing stories from his friend, Enkidu, about what awaits humanity after death. Enkidu says: > On entering the House of Dust, > everywhere I looked there were royal crowns gathered in heaps, > everywhere I listened, it was the bearers of crowns, > who, in the past, had ruled the land, > but who now served Anu and Enlil cooked meats, > served confections, and poured cool water from waterskins. Upon hearing that his position in life did not matter in the underworld, Gilgamesh is terrified and seeks out Utnapishtim, who has achieved immortality after surviving the flood sent by the gods to wipe out humanity. Immortality is also touched on in the myth of Adapa. Adapa’s accidental refusal to eat the food of immortality offered to him by the gods is used as an explanation for the fact that humans die. Also common in Mesopotamian myths is the reoccurring concept that humanity’s purpose is to serve the gods. In all of the creation myths, humans are only made by the gods in order to help in the fields or offer sacrifices. When they get too be too numerous, loud, or otherwise bothersome, the gods attempt to control the population through plagues, droughts, and most famously, the great flood. This disregard for human life emphasizes the hierarchy that existed in the Mesopotamian consciousness, with humans existing as subjects to the will of the gods. == Sources == Modern understanding of Mesopotamian mythology has been provided through archeological excavations of West Asia and the recovery of many stone and clay tablets, some of which contained the records of many myths. There have been different versions of each myth found in various locations across the region, with inconsistencies between each but maintaining overall common themes and narratives. These versions were written in different languages, including Akkadian, Sumerian, and Old Babylonian, and were often translated from one to another, leading to further inconsistencies due to the inherently imperfect nature of these translations. == See also == *Ancient Mesopotamian religion ==References== Category:Religion in Western Asia ","title":"Mesopotamian myths"},{"id":"56781969","text":"The Voice Within is a 1946 British film.

Cox participated in the 1960s Freedom Riders protest was interviewed in the film of the same name, released in 2010. == Personal life and education == Cox was a native of Whiteville, Tennessee. He was a popular preacher in the area and received the name \\"Beltin' Elton\\" during the course of his freedom rides. Cox was the seventh born of his parents' sixteen children. Cox later moved to Kankakee, Illinois at the age of five. He did not complete high school, rather he worked for 18 months cleaning shoes to support his family financially. Later in 1950 he was able to get his diploma from Joliet Township High School at the age of twenty. He later went on to attend Livingstone College, an A.M.E. Zion institution in the city of Salisbury, North Carolina. He completed his time in Livingstone College in 1954 after getting a major in sociology and a minor in history. After his time at Livingstone College, he studied a divinity degree at Howard, and spent a year as a visiting student at a seminary in Cambridge, Massachusetts. == Preaching and the civil rights movement == After his ordination in 1958, he became a pastor of Pilgrim Congregational Church in High Point, North Carolina. Cox quickly gained a reputation for being a strong supporter of the civil rights movement. He started desegregation efforts in local schools, serving as an advisor for NAACP Youth Council, and participating as an observer for the American Friends Service Committee. After the Greensboro sit- ins in February 1960, he encouraged local students to participate in their own sit-ins, under the condition they stay non-violent. Cox views on being non- violent were very strong. He soon caught the attention of the national NAACP leaders, including James Farmer. Farmer hired Cox to help stump the south. Shortly after Farmer hired Cox, Farmer became executive director of CORE. Cox soon received a call from Farmer, wanting to know if Cox would be willing to join the Freedom Rides due to his background as being an ordained minister. Cox agreed and showed up in Washington wearing formal clothing, in case anyone was questioning if the Ride lacked divine guidance. Cox was one of one of the two ordained ministers, the other being J. Metz Rollins from Nashville. Rollins soon had to bow out leaving Cox as the only preacher and John Lewis as the sole representative of the Nashville movement. To parallel the efforts of CORE field secretaries, Cox traveled across the South during the Spring and Summer of 1960. Cox was spreading the gospel of nonviolence to students. Many student activists were accepting of the message. Despite the many instances of white supremacists provoking violence, the sit-ins continued without a violent race war that many predicted would occur. In the summer of 1961, he participated in the CORE Freedom Ride from Missouri to Louisiana on July 8-15 1961. He defended his actions in the Freedom Ride by stating in the film Freedom Riders, \\"If men like Governor Patterson [of Alabama] and Governor Barnett of Mississippi... would carry out the good oath of their office, then people would be able to travel in this country. Then people in Tel Aviv and Moscow and London would not pick up their newspaper for breakfast and realize that America is not living up to the dream of liberty and justice for all.\\" Cox was arrested seventeen times over the course of a few decades. == Later life == Prior to retirement, he served as minister for Pilgrim Congregational Church in High Point, North Carolina. He later worked as chaplain at the VA Hospital in Urbana, Illinois, and finally, as a middle school counselor in Jackson, Tennessee. == References == Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:Congregationalist ministers Category:Freedom Riders Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:People from Whiteville, Tennessee Category:People from Kankakee, Illinois Category:Livingstone College alumni Category:Howard University alumni ","title":"Benjamin Elton Cox"},{"id":"56781994","text":"The Andrew and Mary Stavig House, located at 112 First Avenue, West, in Sisseton, South Dakota, is a Queen Anne-style house built in 1916.

As of 2018, the facilities consisted of three full-size grass pitches and one with artificial turf, with associated changing areas and a small gymnasium. One of these pitches is utilised as the home stadium of the club's reserve team, Alavés B, who usually play in the Tercera División (fourth tier of the Spanish football league system). The club's women's team and academy teams also usually play their fixtures at Ibaia. In 2018, Alavés offered use of Ibaia facilities to local affiliated team San Ignacio for matches after they were promoted to the Tercera División, due to the Federation being concerned with the condition of the playing surface at the latter's usual ground Adurtzabal. ==History of the site== The Ibaia complex was constructed in the 1980s on land owned by the club president Juan Arregui and was modernised in 2002 during a period of success for the club, at which time the complex was renamed in memory of José Luis Compañón, a popular and long-serving Alavés director who had recently died. In spite of grand plans to add a roof over the pitches or build a golf gourse and hotel, little additional investment was made in the training facility over the next decade which was a time of sporting and financial upheaval for the club under the chaotic stewardship of Dmitry Piterman. Complications over ownership of a section of the land (one of the football pitches and the car park) led to that portion of the complex lying unused for several years due to the costs involved, which caused problems regarding access for vehicles and space for the players to train. The dispute was eventually resolved in 2011 when a new board took over. ===Other training sites=== Alavés have close connections with the Betoño Sports Complex (also known as El Glorioso) in the east of the city, and owned the site between 2001 and 2006. The club can also make use of the municipality-owned Olaranbe facilities on the south-eastern outskirts of the city which are home to CD Aurrerá de Vitoria as well as CD Vitoria, the affiliated team of rivals SD Eibar, who previously played at Betoño. Alavés made an unsuccessful attempt to purchase Olaranbe in 2017. ==Future developments== Since becoming owner of Alavés in 2013, Josean Querejeta forged close links between the football club and his basketball team Saski Baskonia including a joint training initiative for children (5+11 Foundation). He also stated his desire for Alavés to have an elite training facility, and this became a more urgent concern when the team were promoted to La Liga in 2016. The proximity of the Betoño grounds to Baskonia's :Fernando Buesa Arena and BAKH multi-sports centre led to it being the preferred site to be developed, ahead of Ibaia which has only basic facilities and is located at an isolated site on the other side of the city. In summer 2017 an agreement in principle over the purchase of Betoño, involving an annual fee to the city until 2020 when a land purchase fee of €6 million would be paid, accompanied by a proposal for the local teams to have use of Ibaia for their matches, appeared to have been reached in summer 2017, but some months later this became less certain when the price of the land involved, including the former Michelin factory adjacent to the sports complex, was set at €16 million by the city council. == References  External links == Category:Football venues in the Basque Country Category:Deportivo Alavés José Luis Compañón Category:Buildings and structures in Álava Category:Sports venues completed in 1982 ","title":"Ciudad Deportiva José Luis Compañón"},{"id":"56782021","text":"is the Head coach of the Chiba Jets Funabashi in the Japanese B.League. == Career statistics == -  align=\\"left\\"  2007-11  align=\\"left\\"  Panasonic  104   16.7 .371  .350  .692  1.5  1.0  0.2  0.1  5.1 - ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Panasonic Trians  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2012-13  6-- style=\\"text- align:center;\\"----  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Chiba Jets  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2016-17  604416 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3rd in Eastern202  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"Lost in 1st round -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Chiba Jets Funabashi  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2017-18  604614 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1st in Eastern642  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"Runners-up -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Chiba Jets Funabashi  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2018-19  60528 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1st in Eastern541  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"Runners-up -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Chiba Jets Funabashi  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2019-20  402812 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"3rd in Eastern---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- - ==References== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese basketball coaches Category:Chiba Jets Funabashi coaches Category:Nagoya Diamond Dolphins players Category:Panasonic Trians players Category:Basketball players at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Basketball players at the 2006 Asian Games ","title":"Atsushi Ōno"},{"id":"56782025","text":"Calliteara horsfieldii, or Horsfield's tussock moth, is a moth of the family Erebidae.

It was released via Bandcamp on October 10, 2016. == Background and composition == In late 2014 a new project was announced by Blank Banshee via social media. Tracks from MEGA began appearing in live sets as early as July 2015. By late 2016 an untitled song (later Frozen Flame) had appeared on Blank Banshee's official website. A Twitter account associated with Blank Banshee initiated an ARG style promotional campaign involving an e-mail address that responded to fans via auto-reply with daily cryptic 'fragments' of a short story concluding on the eve of MEGA’s release. The story 'Zero-Day', makes reference to several song titles and themes presented on MEGA. MEGA was composed using an Akai MPD26 and live instrumentation. It has been described as a “balance of abstract ambience and dance-able trap”. A continuation and expansion of Blank Banshee's signature sound, it is considerably more experimental, relying less on samples than its precursors. In a 2016 interview, Driscoll spoke of the link between his music and ‘virtual environments’, comparing his writing approach to that of 90's RPG music composers. The album artwork was designed by Blank Banshee and features a 3D model of a meteor layered over a fuchsia gradient. MEGA was produced, recorded and mastered in Vancouver, Canada. ==Promotion and release== In the spring of 2017, Blank Banshee embarked on The MEGA Tour, a 3 leg tour spanning Canada, Europe and America concluding in autumn of 2017. MEGA has been released on Cassette Tape, Compact Disc, Vinyl and USB Flash Drive independently through the online store Hologram Bay. == Reception == In an article posted after the release of MEGA, The Fader makes note of Blank Banshee's cult following.

(2018): Asplenium appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum Fact Sheet (content continuously updated). New Zealand Plant Conservation Network. http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.aspx?ID=2053 [Accessed 7 Mar. 2018]. Blade is lanceolate (slightly wider at a short distance above the base, tapering to a point at the tip) to oblong (tapering at the ends but about the same width throughout) in shape. Stipe (stalk below the blade) is 50–150 mm long is grooved, green above, brown below and scattered with narrow triangle scales. The rachis (stalk within the blade) is green, scaly and prominently ridged. Pinnae (leaflets) are 8-20 alternate pairs, ranging from 30-100mm long × 5-30mm wide. Those at the base of the blade are ovate with those towards the tip, very narrowly ovate or elliptic. They are often long and relatively undivided tips. Stalks are covered with tiny scales on the underside. Pinnules at the base of the blade are narrowly elliptic and pinnate, up to 30 x 8mm. Pinnules towards the tip of the blade are linear, entire and sessile. Rhizomes (underground stems) are short and are covered with linear, tapering dark brown scales. Each pinnule on a fertile frond has sori. They are sub marginal and 2-7mm, oblong in shape.Spencer, R. (1995). Ferns, conifers & their allies. Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press. Asplenium appendiculatum frond from above (right) and below (left). Note the many sori.

The Ferns of Tasmania : Their Ecology and Distribution. Hobart, Tas : Tasmanian Forest Research Council. == Taxonomy and Name == Both the common and scientific name ‘spleenwort’ is derived from Asplenium species being used under the doctrine of signatures, to treat ailments of the spleen. This was belief was based on the spleen shaped sori. ‘Wort’ is an ancient English term that means ‘plant’. The species name appendiculatum, is Latin for 'with appendages.Diggs, G.M. and Lipscomb, B.L. (2014). The Ferns and Lycophytes of Texas. Texas: Botanical Research Institute of Texas. Asplenium appendiculatum was formerly known as Asplenium terrestre,, meaning ground dwelling.

He first came to prominence as the winner of the CCTV talent contest Xingguang Dadao ('Star Road') in 2005, and became one of the best- known folk singers form the northwest of China. ==Early life== Abao was born in the outskirts of Datong, Shanxi on 27 February 1969. He began singing when he was four, influenced by a local folk singer although he had no formal training. Apart from Shanxi folk songs, he also learned to sing other folk songs, including songs of Shaanbei from neighbouring Shaanxi. He enrolled at Datong Arts School when he was twelve, and graduated in 1986. ==Career== After graduating, at the age of 17, he began to sing in a music bar in Datong, later joining a travelling troupe, singing at weddings and other occasions in villages around the country. He sang in a variety of genre including pop, rock and folk. In 2004, Abao was performing in Beijing when he was spotted by a producer of a TV show. He was placed in folk-singing competition Xibu Mingge Diansi Dasai ( 西部民歌电视大赛) organized by CCTV, for which he received a bronze prize. Following his appearance on the show, he released a CD, self-titled Abao. He then entered the first season of the singing contest Xingguang Dadao. In the final in 2005, he performed \\"The Wild Lilies Bloom a Brilliant Red\\" (山丹丹开花红艳艳, Shandandan kaihua hongyanyan), and won the contest, beating the duo Phoenix Legend. After winning the title, Abao performed regularly on television for many years, including the 2006 CCTV New Year's Gala. He released his second album in 2006. He has also appeared as a judge on various television shows, including Xingguang Dadao. In 2013, Abao participated in the Chinese reality television show Splash!. ==Performance style== Abao has a wide vocal range, and sings in a distinctive high-pitched voice. His style of singing is a mix of folk styles of Shanxi, Mongolia, and in particular the Xintianyou style of Shaanxi. Abao typically performs dressed as a peasant from Shaanxi, wearing a sheepskin jerkin with black pants, and a white towel knotted on his head. Although he is not from northern Shaanxi but neighbouring Shanxi, he became best known for the Xintianyou style of folk songs of Shaanxi, and was called the \\"Xintianyo Song King\\" (信天游歌王, xintianyou gewang). However, he has been criticised by folk song experts for not being authentic in his vocal technique and style. Nevertheless, his popularity changed the flavours of those folk songs performed by other folk singers, a process described as the \\"Abao phenomenon\\" by a scholar. ==Discography== * Abao《阿宝》(2005) * Xiang qinqin xiang zai xinyan yanshang《想亲亲想在心眼眼上》(2006) * Lei dandan《泪蛋蛋》(2012) * Nongye zhongjinshu 《农业重金属》(2014) ===Songs=== *为你跑成罗圈腿 == References == Category:Chinese male singers Category:Chinese folk singers Category:People from Datong Category:1969 births Category:Living people ","title":"Abao"},{"id":"56782525","text":"Prathama Ushakirana (; English: The First Morning Ray) is a 1990 Indian Kannada fiction drama film directed by Suresh Heblikar, written by Ashok Pai and produced under Manasa Arts.Exploring matters of the mind Besides Heblikar in the lead, the film features Geetha, Girish Karnad, Pramila Joshai and Vanitha Vasu in the pivotal roles.Film cast and crew The film's music was composed by Vijaya Bhaskar and the cinematography was by P.

She is buried in Tama Cemetery in Tokyo. == Activism and writing == Michiko Kanba was born in Tokyo. Her father was Toshio Kanba, a sociologist and professor at Chuo University. Kanba was raised in a middle-class Christian household, and entered University of Tokyo in 1957 and joined the Japan Communist Party on November of that year. After that, she became a leader in the New Left organization Bund and participated in mass demonstrations against the revisions of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan. Kanba was one of the 76 student activists who were arrested at a January 26, 1960 sit-in at Haneda Airport. She also participated in protests around the Diet Building. She was killed just inside the South Gate of the National Diet Building after a group of students broke into the gate and clashed with riot police. An autopsy later determined that she died from chest compression and intracranial bleeding. Police claim that she was knocked down and trampled to death, while students blamed her death on physical assaults by police officers. After her death, Kanba's personal writings and political essays were collected and published under the title \\"The Smile Nobody Knows\\" (Japanese: 人しれず微笑もん). In her writings, she discusses her life and activism. == Legacy == Kanba's death was widely covered at the time, and is seen as a symbol of the 1960 mass protests against the revised Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan. A political cartoon that ran in the popular journal Sekai a month after Kanba's death depicted a yakuza gangster lighting a cigarette for a policeman as they both stand over her dead body in front of the National Diet Building.

Yerevan Azeri drama theater named after Jafar Jabbarly (Cəfər Cabbarlı adına İrəvan Dövlət Azərbaycan Dram Teatrı) is the Azerbaijan State Drama Theater, launched in Yerevan in 1928. == Historical overview == In the early years (1880-1882) of the theater, performances were presented by amateur actors in Yerevan. French traveller Jean Chardin also indicated his thoughts in his writings, when he visited Yerevan at the end of the seventh century. During his travel he watched the show presented by male actors and dancers there. In 1882, the plays of the Armenian author V. Madatov were also started to stage in the Azerbaijanian language. After the arrival of Firudin Kocharli to work as a teacher in Yerevan in 1885, drama theatre also encountered the successful performances. He was eager to participate in the city's cultural occasions and assembles a troupe which staged “Monsieur Jordan and the Dervish Mesteli Shah” base on the Akhundov's play in 1886. The play staged in Turkish language by the students of the Teacher's Seminary on 4 April 1886. Since 1896, performances in the Azeri language have started to take place regularly in Yerevan. In the pre- revolutionary years, the amateurs were staged several well-known plays in the region such as The Inspector General Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol, \\"Haji Gara\\" M.F. Akhundov, \\"Nadir Shah\\" Nariman Narimanov, \\"Deads\\" Jalil Mammadguluzade. Early staged plays were: Dursunali and Ballibadi (1893), Girt-girt (Cluck) (1893), Haji Gara (1894), Reluctant Marriage (1899). These plays were staged in the small venues and were not covered by press. Canpoladov Brother's theatre was also chosen as a place for staging the plays in Yerevan. On 8 December 1896 \\"Monsieur Jordan and Dervish Mastali Shah\\" was performed in that theatre. E. Ter-Grigoryan praised this play and performers, especially, the role of Shahrabanu in the writing of the newspaper Nor dar (New age) of 19 December 1896. The role of Shahrabanu was acted by Yunis Nuri who worked for fifty years in the Yerevan Drama Theatre as an actor, stage director and director of the theater. During the working years in the theatre he along with Mashadi Ismayil staged some plays such as, The Vizier of the Lenkeran Khan (1897), Avarice Creates Enemies (1899), My tongue is my enemy (1900), The Alchemist Molla Ibrahimkhalil (1901), Ignorance (with E.Sultanov, 1902), Haji Gara (with F. Abdulla, 1902). Moreover, his further plays were staged in the wider Canpoladov Brother's theatre between 1905 and 1909, including \\"The Government Inspector\\" by Gogol. === Further history === The theater operated until 1988 (with a break in 1949 - 1967). The central place in the repertoire of the theater was covered by musical comedies \\"Arshin mal alan\\", Mashadi Ibad (If Not That One, Then This One) Uzeyir Hajibeyov. At different times, Yunis Nuri, Kazim Zia, Ali Shahsabakhly and others performed in the theater. During the years of 1934 - 1951 the main director of the theater was Bakhshi Galandarly. \\"Othello\\" was staged by the Yerevan drama theater named after J. Jabbarly in the \\"All-Union Festival of Shakespearean Performances\\", dedicated to the 380th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare in April 1944. After a long break for several years, the theater started to work in Yerevan again in 1967. The plays such as, \\"Sevil\\" by J. Jabbarly, \\"Namus\\" by A. Shirvanzade, \\"Farhad and Shirin\\" by S.

The theater functioned in the Armenian SSR, remaining the only Azerbaijani theater in Armenia. In the 1930s, the theater was called the \\"Azerbaijan state theater named after J. Jabbarly or the \\"Armenian State Turkish theater named after J. Jabbarly. == Current activity == Since 1989 the troupe of the theater continued its activity in Baku, in the theatrical studio at the Azerbaijan Drama Theater. In 1994 the status of state was again given to the theater by the decree of the President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev. Yerevan State Azerbaijan theater continues to stage plays in Azerbaijan and Georgia, Dagistan and Turkey. On 16 October 2007 the theater's anniversary was celebrated at the Azerbaijan State Musical Comedy theater in Baku by the presidential decree. == References == Category:Theatre in Azerbaijan Category:1928 establishments ","title":"Yerevan state Azerbaijan dramatic theater"},{"id":"56782566","text":"The list of shipwrecks in May 1839 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during May 1839. ==1 May2 May3 May4 May5 May6 May7 May9 May10 May11 May12 May13 May14 May15 May17 May18 May19 May20 May21 May22 May23 May24 May25 May26 May27 May28 May29 May30 May31 MayUnknown dateReferences== 1839-05 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in May 1839"},{"id":"56782569","text":"Mahadeva (IAST: Mahā-deva, r. c. 1261-1270 CE) was a ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of Deccan region in India. He succeeded his brother Krishna on the throne, and defeated the Shilaharas of Kolhapur. He unsuccessfully invaded the neighbouring Kakatiya and Hoysala kingdoms, and suppressed a rebellion by his Kadamba feudatories. The Yadava records also credit him with other military successes, but these claims may be exaggerated. == Early life == Mahadeva was a younger brother of his predecessor Krishna. Their father Jaitugi II seems to have died before their grandfather Simhana, because of which Krishna succeeded Simhana. Mahadeva assisted his brother in the administration, as attested by an inscription as well as the text Vedanta- kalpataru. During Krishna's reign, Mahadeva was designated as the heir apparent (yuvaraja) since at least 1250, probably because Krishna's son Ramachandra had not been born, or was not old enough to hold the title of yuvaraja at the time of his ascension. At the time of Krishna's death, Ramachandra seems to have been a minor, and therefore, Mahadeva became the new king. The last inscription from Krishna's reign is dated May 1261. The first record from Mahadeva's reign is a copper-plate inscription dated 21 August 1261, which records a grant made on the occasion of his coronation. Mahadeva must have ascended the throne sometime in August 1261, if not on 21 August. == Wars  Shilaharas of Thane === Mahadeva's grandfather Simhana had subjugated the Shilaharas of Kolhapur around 1215. The kings of another Shilahara branch continued to rule as Yadava feudatories with their capital at Thane. However, these Shilahara rulers occasionally fought with the Yadavas to assert their independence, and such a conflict took place early in Mahadeva's reign. According to the Yadava court poet Hemadri, Mahadeva sent an army including a strong elephant force against the Shilahara ruler Someshvara. After being defeated on the land, Someshvara boarded his ships, but Mahadeva's navy pursued him, and Someshvara drowned in the sea. Hemadri states that Someshvara preferred drowning to capture, because he believed that \\"the fire burning under the ocean would be less oppressive than the wrath of Mahadeva\\". It is not clear if Mahadeva's conquest put an end to the Shilahara branch of Thane, and resulted in the annexation of their territory to the Yadava kingdom. A fragmentary 1266 inscription names Maharajadhiraja Konkana- chakravarti Jaitugi-deva as the ruler of Konkan, and lists Mainayaka and Chandra-prabhu among his ministers. These two ministers also \` Someshvara, and the title Konkana-chakravarti was used by the Shilhara titles. According to one theory, Jaitugi was a son or relative of Someshvara, and had managed to re-establish the Shlihara power. However, the name Jaitugi was borne by earlier members of the Yadava dynasty. This, coupled with the title Maharajadhiraja, suggests that Jaitugi may have been a Yadava prince who governed the annexed territory with assistance of the former Shilahara ministers. === Kakatiyas === The Kakatiya kingdom, located to the east of the Yadava kingdom, suffered from chaos after the death of the Kakatiya king Ganapati in 1261-1262. Queen Rudrama, the successor of Ganapati, faced rebellions from feudatories. Taking advantage of this situation, Mahadeva invaded the Kakatiya kingdom. According to the Yadava court poet Hemadri, the Yadava army defeated the Kakatiya forces, and captured several elephants. Hemadri also states that Mahadeva advanced up to the Kakatiya capital, but did not conquer it because his enemy was a woman. The veracity of this claim is doubtful. Other records suggest that the Kakatiyas repulsed the Yadava invasion. The Pratapa-charita states that Rudrama's forces defeated Mahadeva's army, and pursued it till the Yadava capital Devagiri. A fragmentary Kannada language inscription also states that the Kakatiya general Bhairava defeated the Yadava army, which may be a reference to his repulsion of Mahadeva's invasion. A coin of Mahadeva bears the Kakatiya emblem varaha with the Yadava symbols; this varaha may have been stuck on Mahadeva's coins to mark the Kakatiya victory. === Hoysalas === By the 1260s, the southern Hoysala kingdom had been divided into two parts, and its northern part was ruled by Narasimha II. Around 1266, Mahadeva invaded Narasimha's kingdom, and the existence of Yadava inscriptions in the Hoysala territory (such as the Chitradurga district) indicate Yadava influence there. The invasion was ultimately unsuccessful, and Mahadeva was forced to retreat. Two Hoysala inscriptions state that Mahadeva underestimated Narasimha's power, and entered the battlefield on his elephant in grandiose style; however, he was defeated and fled away on his horse at night. === Kadambas === The Kadamba feudatories of the Yadavas rebelled against Mahadeva, probably encouraged by his defeat against the Hoysalas. Mahadeva's general Balige-deva suppressed the rebellion in c. 1268. === Vaghelas === The Paithan inscription of the Yadavas states that Mahadeva defeated the northern Vaghela king Visala-deva. Mahadeva ascended the throne in 1261, and Visala died in 1262. Therefore, either Mahadeva defeated Visala immediately after his ascension, or this may a reference to a military campaign conducted during Krishna's reign, in which Mahadeva participated as the heir apparent. === Other campaigns === According to the Harihara inscription, fearing Mahadeva, the Gaudas \\"entered anthills\\", and the Utkalas \\"losing shame, fled away\\". These achievements of Mahadeva seem to be purely imaginary. Hemadri claims that Mahadeva's norther neighbours - the Malavas - made a boy their king, because they knew that Mahadeva would not attack a minor. However, the real reason for Mahadeva not attacking their kingdom was probably his preoccupation with campaigns against his southern neighbours. == Administration == Mahadeva's prime minister (Sarvadhikarin) was Maharaja Tapparasa, who held this post until 1275. His other officers and subordinates included: * Hemadri, a noted author and builder, held the position of Shri-karanadhipa in Mahadeva's court; he was the superintendent of the secretariat and the elephant corps; he composed Vrata-khanda during Mahadeva's reign * Chatta-raja and Kucha-raja, Brahmin brothers who administered the Nolambavadi (area around modern Shimoga) from their headquarters at Belur, Karnataka * Deva-raja, an officer in the southern provinces * Mai-deva, a feudatory who administered the Kolhapur region Mahadeva's queen Vaijayi is credit with building the Vaijanatha temple at Paithan. == Last days == The last known date of Mahadeva is May–June 1270; he died soon after. He was succeeded by his son Ammana, but his nephew Ramachandra forcefully dethroned Ammana and became the new king in 1271. == References  Bibliography === * * Category:Seuna (Yadava) dynasty ","title":"Mahadeva of Devagiri"},{"id":"56782576","text":"Giovanni Maria Josse (Tolosa, 13 February 1815 - 12 June 1884) was an Italian composer and conductor.

He was heavily involved in the development of Victoria's telegraphy and telephony networks, and subsequently their integration into those of the Commonwealth. One of Australia's earliest wireless experimenters, he could reasonably be described as Australia's first amateur radio operator, since the majority of his experiments was self-funded and in his private time. ==Early life and familyProfessional careerTelegraph Electrical Society=== In August 1874, Jenvey was a founding member of the Victorian Telegraph Electrical Society and was in the initial committee of management together with contemporaries Smibert, McGaurin and Mickle. Membership was restricted to employees of the Victorian Postal Department as their meeting and experimental room was provided by the Department. Jenvey was a driving force behind the society. After only three months the membership was already 89 persons and papers had been read by all the luminaries of the wireless section. Monthly meeting were held in the Athenaeum and papers were presented which addressed the cutting edge of telegraphy and telephony technology at the time. The society was dormant for two years from 1888, but was reformed in 1890 with Jenvey as president. The society was eventually renamed the Victorian Electrical Society. ===Development of Telegraphy=Development of Telephony=Wireless experiments=== In late 1896, Henry Walter Jenvey, in explaining \\"Telegraphy without Wires\\" to the press, refers only to the leakage and inductive methods. But soon afterwards, he himself was actively engaged in the electromagnetic method. In 1899 his lectures had been extended to include Marconi's system. The successful experiments by Walker in Sydney in August 1899 prompted Jenvey to reveal that for some weeks he had been exchanging messages between the General Post Office and the Telephone exchange at Willis Street, a distance of a half mile. The first message to grace the airwaves of Melbourne was \\"Long reign Duffy\\" referring to the then Postmaster-General for Victoria. By 1900 he was reporting that an experimental network of wireless stations had been established at the Observatory, Wilson Hall at the University and the General Post Office. As part of the Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Science, on 12 January 1900, Jenvey presented a lecture on the current state of wireless telegraphy in the world at the Wilson Hall of the University of Melbourne. At the conclusion of the lecture, he then sent a request from his station erected in the hall and received in return the word \\"Melbourne\\" from his station in the tower of the General Post Office. Jenvey continued his experiments throughout 1900, with regular stations established at Heidelberg and Doncaster. From April 1901, efforts concentrated on Point Ormond, Port Phillip Bay and a station was established with a 155 ft. pole near the shoreline, to take advantage of the better propagation over salt water. From Point Ormond, communication was soon established with Point Cook, a distance of 10 miles, by means of a kite-borne aerial at the latter location. The timing of this extension of transmission distance for Jenvey's apparatus was sublime. The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York were to visit Australia to participate in the celebrations of Federation. Jenvey sought and obtained permission from Senator Drake, the Postmaster-General, to erect a facility at Queenscliff to send greetings to the royal party as they approached Port Phillip Bay. In the first week of May, a large tent was erected on the recreation reserve near the fort and the equipment installed. On Sunday evening 5 May 1901, news was received at Queenscliff that the R.M.S. Ophir was off Split Point and the message of greeting was sent. No reply was received, but it was later confirmed that the message was received by the escorting ships, but the absence of a Naval code precluded a response. While the convoy was in port, Jenvey established contact with Lieutenant Trousdale, R.N., of the warship and messages were then regularly exchanged with the Point Ormond station. When most of the convoy departed on 18 May, Jenvey exchanged messages with the St. George on the initial part of her journey. The last message received from the St. George was at a distance of 37 miles, a record for Australia which would stand for some years. He continued his experiments throughout the 1900s, but prioritised the essential work of developing and integrating the telegraphic and telephonic networks of the fledgling Commonwealth. ===Post Federation integration=Whistle blowing=Postal Commission 1908=== Jenvey gave evidence on a number of occasions at the Postal Commission 1908. ==Sporting lifeLate life and legacy== Jenvey retired from the Postmaster-General's Department in 1910 after 40 years of service. Jenvey passed 14 July 1932 at his home in Carnegie, at age 81 years, with but brief mention of his enduring life's work. His son William Walter Jenvey followed in his father's footsteps and was licensed as an amateur radio operator from the 1920s. Callsigns allocated between 1925 and 1961 were 3AY, VK3AY, VK2YJ and VK2ZO. William was active in a number of Melbourne amateur radio societies in the early 1920s. A plaque has been erected at Fort Queenscliff to commemorate the 6 May 1901 greetings sent by Jenvey to the Royal Visitors. It reads as follows: On 6 May 1901, from near the Black Lighthouse, an address of welcome to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York arriving by ship to open the first Federal parliament was successfully transmitted by H. W. Jenvey, MIEE, electrical engineer, Victorian Postal Department using equipment he designed, built and operated.

Together with her husband Malcolm Moir she formed the architecture practice, Moir & Sutherland. Their work is considered significant as it represents some of the earliest Canberran examples of 'truly modern design'. == Biography == Heather McDonald Sutherland was born in Sydney on 25 May 1903. After her mother died in 1919, Sutherland's father remarried, producing two other children including the opera singer Dame Joan Sutherland.

It also known as Yarovaya Law, after a Russian politician (Irina Yarovaya) who was instrumental in passing it. The law was originally proposed in 2009. It was approved by the Russian parliament in April 2014, and signed into law by President of Russia Vladimir Putin in May that year. ==Contents== The law introduced Article 354.1 to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, making it a criminal offense \\"to deny facts recognized by the international military tribunal that judged and punished the major war criminals of the European Axis countries [this refers to the Nuremberg trials], to approve of the crimes this tribunal judged, and to spread intentionally false information about the Soviet Union’s activities during World War II\\" as well as \\"the spreading of information on military and memorial commemorative dates related to Russia’s defense that is clearly disrespectful of society, and to publicly desecrate symbols of Russia’s military glory\\". The penalty incurred for violating this law is a fine of up to 500,000 rubles (about USD$8,200 as of April 19, 2018) or a prison terms of up to five years, with a ban from certain posts and professions for another three years, and/or up to one year of community service. ==Criticism== The law has been the subject of domestic and international criticism, due to fears of its impact on free speech and historical research. A BBC report in 2017 noted that the law has \\"curbed...the public discussion of WW2 history\\". Human Rights Watch report in 2017 noted that \\"[the law's] selective implementation has so far led to several unjust sentences\\". Russian government officials have dismissed these objections, noting that the law is similar to many other laws known as laws against Holocaust denial, particularly common in Europe. Historian Ivan Kurilla addressed that, saying that while the first European memory laws \\"were propagated by left-wing political forces aiming to preserve the memory of oppressed groups and the crimes of their states\\", newer laws, such as the Russian one, are increasingly \\"backed by pro-state right-wing politicians that seek to create a heroic national narrative and legislate away any doubt about the state’s historical righteousness\\". Historian Nikolay Koposov wrote that the main goal of the law is \\"to promote the cult of the Russian state, whose primary incarnation rests in the celebration of the heroic memory of World War II\\". ==Applications== Shortly after its passage, the law was used to convict Russian blogger Vladimir Luzgin, who compared the September 1939 German invasion of Poland to the Soviet invasion of Poland and referred to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, writing on Russian social media platform VKontakte that \\"communism and Nazism closely collaborated\\". Prosecutors accused him of knowingly posting material that may worsen people's view of the Soviet Union, and the court agreed, stating that he had falsified history by stating \\"that the communists and Germany jointly attacked Poland, unleashing World War Two, or in other words, that Communism and Nazism co-operated honestly\\". Luzgin was fined 200 thousand rubles (roughly ) for \\"circulation of false information about the activities of the USSR during the years of World War II\\", though, as was noted by human rights expert Jacob Mchangama, this claim was \\"essentially, factually correct\\". In 2016 Lugzin appealed his case to the European Court of Human Rights. In April 2015, Russian journalist Polina Petruseva was fined 1,000 rubles (US$) for posting on the social media platform VKontakte a historical picture showing German Nazi troops in Russia, a picture otherwise available from, among others, Wikipedia. That same month, a number of Russian bookstores stopped selling the anti-Nazi graphic novel Maus because of a swastika appearing on its cover design. A toy store selling toy soldiers in wartime German uniforms was also investigated, and a museum displaying anti- Nazi Soviet posters, showing for example crushed swastikas, decided to censor all swastikas on its exhibits. Works of two British historians, Antony Beevor and John Keegan, were banned in one of Russia's regions as the authorities accused them of being influenced by Nazi propaganda. A month later, another Russian journalist, Sergei Vilkov, was fined 1,000 rubles for posting a caricature on VKontakte (in 2011), which combined the logo of the United Russia and a swastika. ==See also== *Presidential Commission of the Russian Federation to Counter Attempts to Falsify History to the Detriment of Russia's Interests ==References== Category:Russian law Category:2014 establishments in Russia Category:2014 in law Category:Memory laws ","title":"Law Against Rehabilitation of Nazism"},{"id":"56782870","text":"Park Yeong-suk or Pak Yŏng-suk (박영숙) may refer to: * Park Yeong-suk (discus thrower) (born 1947), South Korean athlete * Youngsook Park (born 1955), South Korean writer * Park Young-sook (born 1988), South Korean table tennis player ","title":"Park Yeong-suk"},{"id":"56782871","text":"The Lars S.

It stars Dormer, Ed Skrein, Emily Ratajkowski and Joely Richardson. The film was released on 25 May 2018 in the United States by Vertical Entertainment and on 6 July 2018 in the United Kingdom by Shear Entertainment. ==Plot== Sofia McKendrick (Natalie Dormer) is a blind pianist who lives in an apartment in London, and is haunted by the murder of her family by Serbian paramilitaries. Her neighbor is Veronique (Emily Ratajkowski), the daughter of Serbian philanthropist Zoran Radic (Jan Bijvoet), who has committed war crimes during the Bosnian War, and currently suspected of running criminal organizations. Despite the controversy surrounding Veronique's family, Sofia appears to have an amicable relationship with her, although lately has been noticing something wrong with her. During a discussion in an elevator, Veronique slips Sofia a USB drive and tells her that the perfume is Liquid Gold. One night, Sofia overhears a struggle occurring in Veronique's room and witnesses Veronique fall to her death. Despite this, Sofia denies witnessing anything to the police Detective Mills (Neil Maskell), while discreetly holding the USB drive. Later at an event hosted by Radic, Sofia performs and overhears Radic and his associates discussing the circumstances of Veronique's death, in the process revealing that he was the one behind it. Radic's head of security Alexandra Gordon (Joely Richardson) and her brother Marc (Ed Skrein) have a discreet conversation and it is revealed that Veronique was pregnant for twelve weeks, and that Marc was sent to kill her; it is also revealed that Marc was having an affair with her and is likely the father of her child. Radic forms a fixation on Sofia for her connection to Veronique, and Sofia ends up having to dodge police questions and Radic's men looking over Veronique's apartment. Marc rescues Sofia from a rape attempt, and later saves her from an attempted kidnapping and torture. Sofia spends some time with Marc and learns of his and Veronique's affair, and he explains to her that Veronique committed suicide out of paranoia. This in turn leads to an affair between Marc and Sofia. As it turns out Sofia has her own vendetta towards Radic, as she confides in her adopted father Niall (James Cosmo), and gives him the USB drive and reveals that Liquid Gold is the drive's password, which reveals Radic's assets and his criminal operations. Sofia recounts how while she was blind, she had a sister, Balma, who could see but would pretend to be blind for her sister's benefit. It's revealed that Sofia's family were once friends with Radic in Bosnia, but Radic betrayed her family and personally lead the paramilitaries in the massacre of Sofia's family. Niall was a soldier who rescued and protected Sofia for years while she was planning revenge. In addition to this, it's discovered that Veronique has been planning to expose the truth of her father's crimes, but knew that her days were numbered; this was the reason she gave Sofia the USB drive. Sofia learns that Alexandra is also looking for the USB drive, hoping to use the information to usurp Radic and his operations. Sofia hands Alexandra a copy of the drive in exchange for a private audience with Radic at Veronique's funeral. There, Sofia holds a blade to Radic's throat and he realizes the truth of Sofia's past and motives; Radic taunts Sofia by revealing he was in love with her mother, and that he raped her shortly before she gave birth to a daughter; Radic implies and is under the impression that Sofia is his biological daughter. Radic leaves the funeral as Sofia is emotionally devastated by these revelations. As Detective Mills looks into Sofia's past, it's also discovered that \\"Sofia\\" is an alias; the real Sofia was Niall's biological daughter who died in infancy, and Niall named Balma \\"Sofia\\" after taking her in. Niall soon passes away while in the hospital. When Radic discovers Alexandra's treachery, and orders her to be killed; despite the appeal from his sister, Marc leaves Alexandra to die due to her indirect involvement with his unborn child's death. Radic drives to Sofia's apartment with the intent on personally killing her, while Marc rushes to her rescue. As a fight ensues, Marc takes out Radic's men, while Sofia initially holds her own despite her seeming disadvantage. Radic quickly gets the upper hand and prepares to kill Sofia, before Marc barges in and shoves Radic out the window. Radic falls onto a spiked fence, where he's impaled and dies. As Sofia tends to Marc's wounds, there is a final revelation; Sofia was never blind and could see the whole time. Flashbacks show that during the massacre of her family, her blind sister was the one who was killed while they were hiding. Sofia, real name Balma, took her deceased sister's identity and feigned blindness for years. Because she could see, she saw a \\"Wanted Poster\\" and realizes that Marc is a wanted fugitive. The film ends as Marc encourages her to run, while he takes the fall for Radic's death, and Sofia flees the apartment. ==Cast== * Natalie Dormer as Sofia McKendrick / Balma ** Lexie Benbow-Hart as young Sofia * Ed Skrein as Marc Gordon * Emily Ratajkowski as Veronique Radic * Neil Maskell as Oscar Mills * Jan Bijvoet as Zoran Radic * James Cosmo as Niall McKendrick ** Ethan Cosmo as young Niall * Joely Richardson as Alexandra Gordon * Olegar Fedoro as Orthodox Priest * Amber Anderson as Jane * Hala Gorani as herself ==Production== Sofia is depicted as living in Maida Vale, London, where scenes were shot for the film, including a flower shop on Lauderdale Road which was converted to act as a café.

The film, which features Dormer nude as well as contains a sex scene, has been criticised for what some critics called \\"gratuitous nudity\\". Dormer dismissed this in an interview with The Guardian, saying, \\"There has to be sexuality in the power play of a thriller. We have all got bodies, after all. In this film the sex scene, which for me was a love-making scene, is a metaphor for the way my character connects with the part played by Ed Skrein.

This black and white photograph from the Csaky family archives (AC.111) shows a frontal view of the original 1913 plaster. Head was exhibited at Galerie , 46, rue Laffitte, Paris, 1913–14, and at the 1914 Salon des Indépendants titled Tête d'homme (n. 814 or 815). It was subsequently exhibited at Galerie Moos, Geneva, 1920, titled Buste.Marcilhac, Félix, 2007, József Csáky, Du cubisme historique à la figuration réaliste, catalogue raisonné des sculptures, Les Editions de l'Amateur, Paris, n. 1913-FM.16 The work was published in The Sun (New York City), 15 March 1914.\\"André Salmon Sings the Praises of 'Independant' Painters in Paris\\", The Sun.

March 1914, Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France The dimensions and whereabouts of Tête d'homme are unknown, and the work is presumed destroyed. ==Description== Joseph Csaky, Head, 1913, plaster lost; other works include Robert Delaunay, Hommage à Blériot, 1914 (Kunstmuseum Basel); Henri Ottmann, The Hat Seller, published in The Sun (New York), 15 March 1914 Montjoie! Ricciotto Canudo, André Salmon, Head by Joseph Csaky, 3rd issue, 18 March 1914 Head is a plaster sculpture carved in a vertical format. The work represents the bust of a man in a highly Cubist syntax, in opposition to the softness and curvilinearity of Nabis, Symbolist or Art Nouveau forms. Csaky's heads of the period partake in the \\"stylized, hieratic, nonportrait tradition of tribal and ancient art\\", writes Edith Balas, \\"in which there is a total lack of interest in depicting psychological traits\\". Head is testimony to Csaky's early immersion in the Cubist idiom.Edith Balas, 1998, Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, American Philosophical Society. Reproduced Fig. 6, p. 24 The subject is constructed with a grouping of faceted planar forms that together form a tight cohesive structure. The models facial features are simply constructed with only a few surface planes juxtaposed in geometric terms at various angles. Sphericity of the head is broken by angular cuts, forming triangular (ears), rectangles (the nose) and arcs (cheekbones), visible in the photograph. The shoulders and neck form a robust base upon which the head rests. The models hair, while treated almost realistically, are stylized and cut radically at an angle with the forehead. Only one eye is visible. The treatment of Csaky's Tête d'homme, as other works by the artist executed between 1910 and 1914, suggest, as Albert Edward Elsen notes, that Csaky had looked not only at Picasso's earlier painting and sculpture, but also at African tribal masks whose exaggerated features and simplified design accommodated the need to be seen at a distance and to evoke strong feeling.Albert Edward Elsen, Origins of modern sculpture: pioneers and premises, G. Braziller, 1974 Just as in Csaky's Groupe de femmes (1911–12) and Danseuse (1912), Head already shows a new way of representing the human figure, an unwillingness to revert to classical, academic or traditional methods of representation. The complex angular syntax visible in Head was born out of a growing sense of contemporary dynamism, out of rhythm, balance, harmony and out of the powerful geometric qualities of Egyptian art, African art, early Cycladic art, Gothic art, of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Auguste Rodin, Gustave Courbet, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne, all of whom Csaky greatly admired. ==Salon des Indépendants, 1914== At the Salon des Indépendants, held in Paris 1 to 30 March 1914, composed of many Orphist works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor of the at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées: Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay, Patrick Henry Bruce and Arthur Burdett Frost were largely represented.Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants Csaky exhibited Tête d'homme (plaster, n. 814 or 815 of the catalog), along with another bust and Danseuse (1912), executed in a highly Cubist facture. Several years later, Marcel Duchamp, speaking about his own experience during the revolutionary years in the history of art of the 20th century, presented Joseph Csaky as \\"belonging to a group of sculptors who, before 1914, imparted a new direction in their work. The theory of Cubism was then a trampoline that permitted the propulsion towards unexplored regions and Csaky, even if influenced by Cubism, developed his own concepts on the treatment of space. His first works appeared more theoretical and intellectual than his later works when he oriented his personal development towards atmospheric structures.\\"Marcel Duchamp, 1958, Duchamp du signe, suivi de Notes, Michel Sanouillet, Paul Matisse, Anne Sanouillet, Paul B. Franklin, Flammarion, 2008, (re-edition) , 9782080116642 Reviewing the 1914 Indépendants in an article entitled Le Salon, published in the periodical Montjoie! and Montparnasse, André Salmon, who usually considered works the Indépendants 'true mediocrity' of the pupils of l'art officiel, encouraged his readers to visit this years salon to discover 'true modernity'. To justify his claim he reproduce a large photograph Csaky's 1913 Head. ==Literature== * \\"André Salmon Sings the Praises of 'Independant' Painters in Paris\\", The Sun.

His first name was Yi Jun(이준 李濬), his changed name was Yi Dam (이담 李湛), and his other name was Yi Shik (이식 李湜). From 1776 to 1782, he was a leading remainderman during the early rule of Jeongjo. His posthumous epithet is unknown. == Life == Crown Prince Sanggye was born on January 21, 1769, in Hanseong. He was the son of Prince Euneon and his wife Lady Song of Sangsan, a daughter of Song Rak-hyu. His father was the son of Crown Prince Sado and his great-grandfather was King Yeongjo. During his early childhood, he was adopted by Jeongjo of Joseon by Hong Guk-yeong.Hong Guk-yeong His first name was Yi Jun. Beginning in June 1778, of Pungsan was a concubine of 22nd King Jeongjo. She was the sister of Hong Guk-yeong, a powerful kingmaker, and the fourth cousin once removed of Lady Hyegyong. At this time Ku Seon-bok was other some Joseon noble's was support to his heir to the throne;Ku Seon-bok but as King Jeongjo was in his mid-20s, he could still be expected to produce an heir by another woman. Kim Jong-su, along with others of King Jeongjo's gentlemen, were enemies of Hong Guk-yeong, and demanded Hong Guk-yeong and Crown Prince Wanpung be punished. On May 7, 1779, Lady Hong Wonbin of Pungsan died suddenly, Kim Jong-su with other King Jeongjo's gentlemen repeatedly accused Hong Guk-Yeong and Crown Prince Wanpung. On September 26, 1779 Hong Guk-yeong was expelled from power and jailed. Crown Prince Wanpung was disenfranchised as heir to the throne and from the peerage. His title was changed from Wanpung to Sangkye. His name was also changed from Yi Jun to Yi Dam, but the King's retainers continued their attacks. On January 21, 1784, he was married to Lady Shin of Pyeongsan, a daughter of Shin-oh.顯祿大夫益平君諡狀 On November 20, 1786, Crown Prince Sangkye suddenly died and was suspected to have been poisoned. Some accused Hong Guk- yeong or his original father Prince Euneon,Prince Euneon or other some King Jeongjo's retainers. After his death, was buried at Yeonhul Gung castle, near modern Sinchon Station and Yonsei University. His funeral was personally arranged by his adoptive father, King Jeongjo. Crown Prince Sanggye was not reinstated for many years. In 1801, his mother Lady Song of Sangsan and his wife Lady Sin of Sangkye was executed for their belief in Catholicism (Neo- Confucianism was the state religion of the Joseon dynasty). Thereafter, he was still not reinstated, because of his close family members' religious beliefs. He was eventually amnestied and rehabilitated on June 17, 1849, by the king Cheoljong of Joseon, who was his half-nephew. ==Ancestry See also == * Yi Dang * Jeongjo of Joseon * Crown prince Sado * Queen Jeongsun ==References Site link == * Crown Prince Sangkye * 顯祿大夫益平君諡狀 Category:Joseon Dynasty people Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded Category:18th-century Korean people Category:1769 births Category:1786 deaths Category:House of Yi Category:Korean princes Category:Korean murderers ","title":"Prince Sanggye"},{"id":"56783211","text":"Ksenia Aleksandrovna Razumova (Ксения Александровна Разумова in Russian; also transliterated Xenia Razumova) (January, 1931) is a Russian physicist.

Experiments carried out by her at this tokamak, along with results obtained on the T-3 and T-4 tokamaks, convinced the scientific community that the pessimistic forecasts for the future of magnetic confinement based on the Bohm formula Bohm, D. (1949) The characteristics of electrical discharges in magnetic fields, A. Guthrie and R. K. Wakerling (eds.), New York: McGraw-Hill. were unfounded. In 1971, she was awarded the USSR State Prize for creating and investigating high temperature thermonuclear plasmas in tokamaks. ФИЗИКА ПЛАЗМЫ, том 27, No. 5, с. 479-480 (2001) .

Her parents, Fulgence and Antonia Tingitana, father an engineer and mother, an education specialist encouraged the development of her writing skills by sending her to writing camps over the summer holidays. At Mzizima High School where she studied she formed an appreciation for history and music. She played the violin and was the chairperson of the music club.https://nuruthelight.blogspot.com During a talent show at Zanaki Secondary School, she was a visiting performer for Radio One. At 17 years that performance went on to give her an entry into the media industry, with her own show on East Africa Radio. == Career == After finishing her BSC in finance with a minor in media at Marymount College Manahattan College and in 2005 she went to work at East Africa Television as the Head of Programming. During her time at the television station she saw the creation and televising of the popular television programs Ze Comedy, Friday Night Live, 5 Live! and Nirvana. Ze Comedy is the highest ever rated comedy sketch show on Tanzanian television. Seko Shamte started her own production company, Alkemist Media in 2008. producing programmes and films about Tanzania and Africa for international distribution. Starting with features on CNN's Inside Africa, including a story on Hashim Thabeet, Tanzania's NBA basketball player and his contribution to his community in Tanzanians; a story on the migration of Maasai men in Tanzania. (Inside Story) This was followed by a series of other pieces for CNN, ABC networks in the United States and BBC in the UK. === Mkwawa: Shujaa wa mashujaa === In 2011, her first feature-length documentary was released, Mkwawa: Shujaa wa Mashujaa. which she had developed for sixteen years. The critique of a history teacher on Chief Mkwawa being ‘a coward, as most African leaders are…’ gave her pause and wanting to challenge that critique, she researched Chief Mkwawa's history for herself. When the story was ready, she applied for the Tanzania Media Fund (TMF) and won the grant. The documentary was released in 2011. === The Team Tanzania === Following Mkwawa she went to co-write, produce and direct a series called ‘The Team: Tanzania. This story focused on gender inequality in Tanzania looking to transform society’s gender norms. The story has two teenage girls, Upendo and Sophia, and their struggle for identity. The thirteen part series was in collaboration with the NGO Search for Common Ground and aired on East Africa Television. The series has gone on to be viewed on the youtube platform. === Home Coming === In 2015, her feature film Home Coming was released in Dar es Salaam. The story is an examination on corruption and how it perpetuates itself, generation after generation. Home Coming was well received by the Tanzanian Film Industry. The film went on to be selected to play at the Pan African Film Festival in 2017. Seko’s next project is slated to be a documentary on Julius Kambarage Nyerere, the first president of Tanzania. == Filmography == {  - ! YEAR !! TITLE !! ROLE!!

He was trained by famous Kwakwaka'wakw totem artist Henry Hunt, at the Provincial Museum of British Columbia, but though as Hunt he carved Totem poles, which was not traditionally used by the Coast Salish people (who usually carved mainly house posts with human figures), Charlie worked in the Salish carving tradition rather than Hunt's Kwakwaka'wakw tradition. He was described as having \\"deep knowledge of the language, history, oral traditions, and ceremonial practices\\" of the Cowichan people. Though he was known for his adherence to the Coast Salish traditional aesthetic, he was also known for his insistence on experimenting with new forms of expression. He has been described as having contributed to a revival of Coast Salish artistic tradition.Barbara Brotherton. 2008. S'abadeb.

Press. A certain adzed texture is characteristic of Charlie's artistic style.Hilary Stewart. 2009. Looking at Totem Poles. D & M Publishers. p 119 Charlie described how his knowledge of oral tradition of the Hul'qumi'num language of the Cowichan tribe inspired him to design his totem poles - for example the choice of an eagle with a dog salmon on top of a bear with atraditional Salish Swaixwhe mask for his totem pole at Qualicum beach.http://www.qbmuseum.ca/outside-exhibits/ He also trained several other Coast Salish artists including Jane Martson, Luke Marston and John Marston.Suzanne Fournier. 2014.

Cape Breton University Press, 2012 He was awarded many prizes for his work, including the Canadian Centennial Medal (1967), the Order of British Columbia (2001)https://orderofbc.gov.bc.ca/members/obc-2001/2001-simon- charlie/ and the Order of Canada (2003). Much of his work was totem poles, and they are exhibited in museums such as the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, and in the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. Several of his totem poles are in the Totem Pole collection of the City of Duncan, including three at the centre court of the Duncan Mall.Jonathan Meuli. 2013.

Fujio published from 1968 to 1969 in the Shogakukan magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday. Set in the same universe as Doraemon, and predating that work by only one year, the manga was then made in a TV anime series by the animation studio Shin-Ei Animation in 1991. From the manga also two animated films were made: 21 Emon: Uchuu e Irasshai! and 21 Emon: To Space! The Barefoot Princess. The official English name is 21 Emon: The 21st Century Kid. The manga, set in a science fiction 2018, tells the story of 18-year-old 21 Emon (although he is 16 in the anime), heir to a long dynasty of hotel owners, whose ancestor goes back to the Tokugawa shogunate. The anime, unlike the manga, is set between 2051 and 2071. The robot character Gonsuke would go on to make numerous cameo appearances in the 2005 Doraemon series. == Plot Manga=== Having to struggle with keeping up their family hotel business at the age of 18, 21 Emon is trying his hardest to help out his family as the new heir, although his dream is not being in the hotel business his whole life but exploring the wide space as a space pilot. ===Anime=== The plot is the same as the manga, but with changes. Although 21 Emon is 18 in the manga, he is around 11-13 years old in the anime adaptation. ==References * Category:1991 anime television series Category:Japanese children's animated comic science fiction television series Category:Animated drama television series Category:Japanese children's animated science fantasy television series Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Fujiko F Fujio Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Drama anime and manga Category:Shōnen manga Category:Shogakukan franchises Category:Shogakukan manga Category:1990s animated comedy television series Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Teens in fiction ","title":"21 Emon"},{"id":"56783232","text":"Bilqees Mukhtar is a Pakistani politician who had been a Member of the Provincial Assembly of Sindh, from 2002 to May 2018. ==Early life and education== She was born on 23 May 1969 in Karachi.

Her childhood was marred by abuse from her father, which led her family to disintegrate by the time she was in middle school. Ikeda studied up to second year of high school before dropping out as she was unable to pay for her tuition. In 1995, she trained as a caregiver and then worked at the Itabashi welfare office. Later in 1997, she enrolled in a Tokyo vocational school and received a qualification in welfare. She worked in the office until 2011, when she moved to Hokkaido to head an NGO focusing on rebuilding the lives of welfare recipients and pensioners. Several years after settling in Hokkaido, she entered Hokkaido University as a mature student and took a postgraduate course in Public Policy. She graduated in March 2015. Ikeda first ran for public office in the 2014 general election. She ran as an independent candidate for the Hokkaido 2nd district seat with the support of the centre-left Democratic Party of Japan, finishing in the third place. She would then become the official opposition candidate for the neighbouring Hokkaido 5th district seat in the 2016 by-election, but lost narrowly to the LDP candidate Yoshiaki Wada. Ikeda ran again for the seat in the 2017 general election. She narrowly lost her rematch with Wada but obtained enough votes to be returned through the CDP's PR block list.

The FFRP also works to build the capacity of women Parliamentarians, in order to carry out advocacy around gender and development issues, and to successfully manage their other parliamentary duties. == Mission & Vision == The stated mission of the FFRP is “to contribute to the building of an egalitarian, equitable, inclusive and participatory society, playing the influential role in gender matters in accordance with the Parliament mission”. The stated vision of the FFRP is “A society characterized by unity, equality and equity between men and women”. == Achievements  Legislative ===  The Law on the Prevention and Punishment of Gender-based Violence  The FFRP was responsible for drafting and introducing the Gender-Based Violence Bill (GBV), a private members bill and the only bill so far, at that point in time, to have originated outside of the executive branch of government. The process of drafting the original bill began in early 2005, when the FFRP mobilized its members and reached out to community leaders across the country to gather information and recommendations from the general population on how to define, prevent and appropriately punish acts of GBV. Following initial community outreach, a mass-media campaign began with the intention of raising awareness and sensitizing the country to the problem of GBV. Later on in the year, female parliamentarians of the FFRP returned to the field again to consult further with communities regarding the bill, and worked in collaboration with NAWOCO to conduct discussion sessions with women only, in addition to the discussions already taking place that involved both women and men.Pearson, E. (2008). Demonstrating legislative leadership: The introduction of Rwanda's gender-based violence bill. The Initiative for Inclusive Security, a program of Hunt Alternatives Fund. A consultative committee was established involving the Ministry of Gender, the Ministry of Justice, the national police, the legal community and civil society. The “Draft Law on Prevention, Protection and Punishment of Any Gender-Based Violence” was presented to Parliament on August 2, 2006, and after internal deliberation and revision, was passed into law in 2009. Though the deliberation period was longer than desired, the process of drafting the bill was extremely collaborative, and demonstrated the state’s apparent commitment to engaging in a two-way dialogue with civil society about important matters of gender justice. The Law, also known in short-hand as the GBV law, defines different forms of gender-based violence and the applicable punishment for these crimes; the full text of the law can be accessed online in three different languages (English, French and Kinyarwanda). === Community development === The FFRP has supported communities in Rwanda through various activities, including donating cows, distributing water tanks to households, planting kitchen gardens, and donating house materials, including schools materials to girls who have dropped out of school. For their 20th anniversary, the FFRP visited Gisagara District as it is one of the most vulnerable districts in Rwanda. Gisagara District is one of 8 districts that have now entered into partnerships with the FFRP since 2011, in terms of economic empowerment efforts for the district's most vulnerable women. The FFRP has also sought collaboration with Gisagara District authorities involving outreach programmes dedicated to helping the local community increase its innovative capacity. == Women in Rwanda's Parliament == Rwanda has a bicameral parliament. It consists of two chambers, the Senate (Upper House) and the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House). Rwanda was the first country in the world with a female majority in parliament, currently at 61.3% for the Lower House and 38.5% for the Upper House. Bolivia is currently second to Rwanda for majority of female parliamentarians. == References == Category:Parliament of Rwanda Category:Women in Rwanda ","title":"Rwanda Women Parliamentary Forum"},{"id":"56783386","text":"is a former Japanese football player and manager.

She was born in May 1929 in the Butikkiro, the official residence of the Katikkiro, in the Mengo neighbourhood of Kampala. Kalema attended Gayaza Junior School for a year, and then King's College Budo for the remainder of her primary and secondary schooling. She enrolled for a commercial course in secretarial training, and worked as secretary and bursar at Gayaza High School until 1949. In 1950, she married William Kalema, a teacher at King's College Budo who later became a renowned politician and Government Minister of Commerce. In 1955 she commenced a one year course in Social Work and Social Administration at Newbattle Abbey, an Adult Education College in the United Kingdom, followed by a Diploma in Social Studies at the University of Edinburgh. == Political career == In 1961, Grace Ibingira and Adoko Nyekon initiated Rhoda Kalema into the Uganda People's Congress. She was a junior minister of Culture and Community Development in Binaisa's regime. However, after the death of her husband in 1972—he was abducted and killed during Idi Amin's regime—she gave up political participation until 1979 when, after Idi Amin's downfall, she joined the National Consultative Council (NCC) formed by the Uganda National Liberation Front under Edward Rugumayo, as one of two female representatives. In 1980 she was one of the founding members of the Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM). She was arrested three times by the State Research Bureau: on January 23, 1979; on February 21, 1981 (when she and other politicians were arrested after numerous attacks on police stations) and on February 4, 1983.

The proposed line would have connected the planned High Speed 2 line to the High Speed 1 line via a high-speed route running south of London, and would form a direct rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick airports. The proposal was rejected by government in December 2018 and will not go ahead. ==Background== The first high-speed railway line to be built in the United Kingdom was High Speed 1 (HS1), the route connecting London to the Channel Tunnel, which opened 2003−2007. A second high-speed line named High Speed 2 (HS2), which will initially run between London and Birmingham, is planned to open in 2026. A proposal to build a direct connection between HS1 and HS2 in central London was dropped from HS2 construction plans in 2014 due to cost and the impact on the London district of Camden. The HS2 plans also included a connection to Heathrow Airport at Heathrow Hub railway station, but that link was dropped in 2015. A number of other schemes have been considered to create a rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick airports, collectively dubbed \\"Heathwick\\". ==Planned route== The proposed line would leave the HS2 line at a junction near Denham in Buckinghamshire, and then run on a route curving south-west of London, partly parallel to the M25 motorway, with stations at Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport. It would then head eastwards across Kent using the existing upgraded South Eastern main line via to join HS1 at a junction at . The link between HS1 and HS2 would allow high-speed trains to travel directly between regional cities in Great Britain and destinations in Continental Europe. A fifth of the line was planned to be in tunnel in order to mitigate the environmental impact on sensitive rural areas such as the North Downs. It was also proposed to construct a link with the Great Western Main Line. It would cost £10 billion to build and around 40% of the route would reuse existing tracks; the proposals included upgrades at and stations. The scheme envisaged a 15-minute transfer time between Heathrow and Gatwick, allowing the two airports to operate jointly as an airline hub. Fast connections between the airports and Birmingham, Manchester and Cardiff were also proposed, and the proponents of the scheme claimed that it would alleviate pressure on transport within London by reducing the need for air passengers to travel through the city. The scheme was also linked to proposals to re-open Manston Airport in Kent, which could be connected to the line via . ==Government response== Expedition Engineering's proposals were submitted to the Department for Transport (DfT) at the end of July 2018, as part of the Government's plans to encourage private investment. The HS4Air scheme was rejected by Government in December 2018 because the DfT did not consider that Expedition Engineering's proposals were \\"financially credible without government support\\", and anticipated public opposition to building the route across green belt land. ==See also== * Heathrow Airport transport proposals *Regional Eurostar ==References== Category:Proposed rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom Category:Proposed railway lines in England Category:High Speed 2 Category:High-speed railway lines in the United Kingdom Category:Heathrow Airport transport proposals Category:Gatwick Airport ","title":"HS4Air"},{"id":"56783427","text":"ESIC Medical College, Faridabad, or in its full name Employees' State Insurance Corporation Medical College and Hospital, Faridabad (ESICMC&HF;), is a Government co-educational Medical College located at New Industrial Township-3, Faridabad, the industrial capital of India in Haryana, India.

It is in the collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome. The painting shows the theme of the ill-matched couple, a popular theme in the arts of the period, though generally the one making the proposition is a man to a courtesan, not a woman to a man. The theme generally shows the man offering the woman a ring in combination with a purse of money. Earlier examples of Haarlem versions of this that were based on earlier Flemish examples are: File:Cornelis van Haarlem The Choice between the Young and Old.jpgCornelis van Haarlem, 1597 File:Ill-Matched Couple 20171205.jpgHendrick Goltzius, 1614 File:HENDRICK GOLTZIUS UNEQUAL LOVERS.jpgHendrick Goltzius, c. 1615 File:'The Unequal Lovers' by Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem, 1619.jpgCornelis van Haarlem, 1619 This painting certainly fits in that tradition, unlike Leyster's much more ambiguous The Proposition, also dated the same year. Here a man is sitting sideways on a simple wooden chair with his legs crossed playing the lute. He turns his head to the spectator. Behind him an older woman grasps a money purse with one hand and offers the musician a ring with the other. Both are dressed in simple peasant clothing, but the table has a second money purse and gold coins are spread out for counting from a money box gleaming with metal decorations that seem to contradict the simple characters in the scene. On a small three-legged stool a candlestick rests, but there is no candle in it. It lines up with a pile of coins as if to imply that instead of the \\"fire of love\\" there is money to be had for the taking. The pose of the man leaning over the back of a chair is a common pose used by Leyster's master Frans Hals, and the crossed legs of the musician can be seen in the work of Leyster's future husband Jan Miense Molenaer. Perhaps the lute was his or hers as it features in works by both of them.

He is known for appearing on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood when he was 10 years old, talking about his electric wheelchair and why he needed it. Erlanger's philosophy was summarized in a 2002 Wisconsin Public Television ad: \\"It doesn't matter what I can't do—what matters is what I can do.\\" == Early and personal life == Jeffrey Clay Erlanger was born in Madison, Wisconsin, on November 30, 1970 to Howard and Pam Erlanger, joining his older sister, Lisa. His father is a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Law. When Erlanger was 7 months old, he was diagnosed with a spinal tumor. Surgery was used to remove it, but he was left as a quadriplegic. He received his first electric wheelchair when he was 4 years old. He required many additional surgeries while growing up. Erlanger graduated from Memorial High School and from Edgewood College with a degree in political science. == Mister Rogers' Neighborhood == Before Erlanger underwent spinal surgery at age 5, his parents asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to meet \\"Mister Rogers\\". His sister wrote Fred Rogers about her brother's wishes. Rogers happened to be traveling to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, so the Erlangers drove to meet him for breakfast in a restaurant. Several years later, Erlanger was invited to be on Rogers' show. Erlanger appeared in Season 11, Episode 4 (#1478), which aired on February 18, 1981. The ten-year-old showed Rogers how his electric wheelchair worked and explained why he needed it. They talked about his parents, doctors, recent surgery and what you can do when you're sad. Together they sang one of Rogers' popular songs, \\"It's You I Like\\". The two of them continued to communicate. In speeches Rogers gave, he told of Erlanger's example of \\"overcoming obstacles and feeling comfortable about yourself.\\" When Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1999, Erlanger was a surprise guest to introduce him. Rogers leaped out of his seat and straight onto the stage when Erlanger appeared. In May 2003, Erlanger attended the memorial service for Rogers in Pittsburgh to honor him. Erlanger's appearance on Rogers' show is featured in the 2018 PBS special Mister Rogers: It's You I Like. The special's host and former crew member, Michael Keaton, recalled Rogers saying his most treasured moment on the show was with Erlanger. Erlanger's parents were interviewed in the 2018 documentary film Won't You Be My Neighbor?. == Political career and activism == Erlanger worked as an intern for Representative Tammy Baldwin and Senator Russ Feingold, who honored Erlanger in the Senate. Erlanger became very active in Madison politics, holding a number of significant positions in the community including member of the Economic Development Commission, chair of the Commission on People with Disabilities, and chair of the Board of Directors of the Community Living Alliance. In 2002 he ran for the Madison Common Council in the 8th District. He helped gain the accessible taxicab service in Madison today. In 2004 Erlanger flew to Boston to attend the Democratic National Convention, although he did not have a ticket. Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, whose campaign Erlanger had worked on, was on his flight and got him in. Falk said after his death, \\"Jeff was passionate about our nation on a big- scale level and equally passionate about our community,\\" adding, \\"This is a man who devoted so many countless hours to making things better for other people.\\" In February 2000 Erlanger made a random connection in an America Online chat room at the end of the day with a woman in Boston who said she was trying to kill herself. She said she had \\"cut herself and blood was going down her arms.\\" Unsure if it was a hoax, Erlanger decided to take action, but his phone was in use with the computer modem. He went to his building's lobby to call the police in Madison and Boston, and then AOL to help with the rescue. Boston police found the woman, who had fresh cuts on her wrist, and took her to a hospital for medical treatment. == Death and legacy == After Erlanger choked on some food, he was in a coma for three weeks before dying on Sunday, June 10, 2007. He donated his organs. Debbie Friedman sang at his memorial service. After his death, the City of Madison Common Council created the annual Jeffrey Clay Erlanger Civility In Public Discourse Award in his honor. Recipients include Torrie Kopp Mueller for efforts to eliminate racism, empower women, and decriminalize homelessness; William Greer, president and CEO of Journey Mental Health Center; Leslie Ann Howard, United Way's president and CEO; and Nan Brian, whose career has served children. == References  External links == * Jeff and Mr. Rogers singing It's You I Like at PBS Kids * Remembering Jeff Erlanger, at Isthmus.com * Obituary, at Pittsburgh Post- Gazette * Jeffrey Clay Erlanger Civility In Public Discourse Award at cityofmadison.com * * Category:1970 births Category:2007 deaths Category:People from Madison, Wisconsin Category:Edgewood College alumni Category:People with tetraplegia Category:Activists from Wisconsin Category:Wisconsin Democrats ","title":"Jeff Erlanger"},{"id":"56783510","text":"Dilfareb (English ; Seductive) is a 2015 Pakistani drama serial directed by Amin Iqbal, and written by Zafar Mairaj.

The 1/50th Infantry was based at Landing Zone Uplift, 8 kilometres north of the town of Phù Mỹ. ==Battle== On the morning of 5 May, the 3rd Division attacked Landing Zone Salem (), 5 kilometres north of LZ Uplift, and Landing Zone Ollie () a further 3 kilometres north. The commander of the 1/50th Infantry, Lt. Col. John B. Carter ordered two platoons from Company A, 1/50th Infantry to the village of An Bao, 2 kilometres west of LZ Salem, where signal intercepts indicated a PAVN regimental headquarters might be located. At 08:00 the force of 9 M113s left LZ Uplift and headed north on Highway 1. By 10:00 the force had turned west off Highway 1 towards An Bao and were crossing some dry rice paddies in a clearing when they saw a group of approximately 15 PAVN run into the tree line. The M113s moved into line abreast and fired their machine guns into the tree line but received no return fire. After searching the area the force formed a defensive perimeter and the men ate lunch. As they were preparing to move out, the position was hit by Rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) and recoilless rifle fire which disabled the command and medical vehicles. Mortar rounds and machine gun fire then began to hit the U.S. position. Realizing that they were surrounded, the commander Lieutenant Dennis E. Hinton radioed for support. The PAVN forces comprising the 97th Battalion, 2nd Regiment, and the 7th and 9th Battalions, 22nd Regiment began closing in on the U.S. position. Two M113s attacked on the PAVN positions but both were soon disabled by RPGs. An M132 Armored Flamethrower was also hit and its fuel tanks caught fire. The remaining 4 M113s and some soldiers on foot retreated through their entry point into the clearing and headed back to Highway 1 leaving behind 15 men in a small perimeter a few hundred metres northwest of the disabled M113s. On learning of the ambush, Lt. Col Carter ordered Company C, 1/50th Infantry and Company B, 1st Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment with its 7 M48s to go to the assistance of Company A. The 1/69th tanks overshot the turnoff to An Bao by 1.5 kilometres and when they did turn west off of Highway 1, one of the tanks got stuck in the mud, leaving one tank to assist in retrieving the wedged tank, 5 M48s proceeded towards An Bao. Company C reached the ambush site first and entered the clearing as the PAVN were closing in on the 15 men from Company A, the M113s moved in to form and armored perimeter but were soon hit by intense fire that killed and wounded several of the men of Company C. The 5 M48s then arrived in the clearing and the U.S. forces were able to withdraw and regroup while air and artillery strikes hit the clearing and surrounding forest. At 17:00, a platoon of tanks from Landing Zone English and Company B, 1/50th Infantry, joined the force and the combined force re- entered the clearing to engage the PAVN. Despite the preceding hours of air and artillery strikes heavy fire again met the U.S. force. The previously dry paddyfields were now filling up with water from a dike that had been deliberately opened or destroyed in the bombing and the ground was now too muddy to be crossed. The Americans withdrew to establish a night defense position while air and artillery strikes continued. At 03:30 on 6 May the PAVN attacked the northwest of the U.S. perimeter with over a hundred soldiers advancing behind a hail of mortar and RPG fire that detonated an ammunition stockpile, injuring several Americans. The assault was beaten back and the PAVN withdrew at 05:00, dragging away their dead and wounded. Three Americans had been killed in the attack. Later that morning the Americans advanced again on the tree line but the PAVN had left the battlefield and they found only empty bunkers and fighting positions. ==Aftermath== The battle was claimed as a U.S. victory with MACV claiming 117 PAVN were killed with 70 weapons recovered, with 18 Americans killed. ==References== Category:1968 in Vietnam Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Battles involving Vietnam Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:History of Bình Định Province ","title":"Battle of An Bao"},{"id":"56783516","text":"Akinloye Tofowomo popularly known as Akiin Shuga (born January 6, 1975) is a Nigerian singer, songwriter and musicpreneur.

It won the gold medal at the Salon in 1888. == Description == Le Rêve is a painting depicting the military - the specialty of its creator, Édouard Detaille. It shows an encampment of sleeping French soldiers that continues as far as the eye can see. The soldiers are young conscripts of the French Third Republic who are taking part in summer exercises, probably in Champagne. They are dreaming of the glory of their predecessors, and of exacting revenge following their country's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. In a patriotic allegory, French soldiers from previous battles are depicted in the sky above in an intentionally indistinct way. They include soldiers from the French Revolutionary Army, as well as those involved in the battles of Austerlitz, Trocadero, Magenta and Solferino, the invasion of Algiers and the defeats at Gravelotte and Reichshoffen in 1870. This type of painting corresponds well with the sentiment of the time, evoking nostalgia for a unified, victorious France, and acting as a memento of a mythical France that was edging further into the past. For Detaille, creating this painting was to \\"take a direct political position\\", showing his support for nationalist general Georges Boulanger, as well as celebrating the army. == References  Further reading == * * * Category:French paintings Category:1888 paintings category:Paintings of the Musée d'Orsay ","title":"Le Rêve (Detaille)"},{"id":"56783527","text":"Iram Khalid is a Pakistani politician who had been a Member of the Provincial Assembly of Sindh, from June 2013 to May 2018. ==Education== She earned the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Saint Joseph's College for Women, Karachi. ==Political career== She was elected to the Provincial Assembly of Sindh as a candidate of Pakistan Peoples Party on a reserved seat for women in 2013 Pakistani general election.

The skirmish is regarded as one of the hardest battles fought by Norwegian soldiers in the UNIFIL force, and the PLO soldiers got as close as 30 meters. Throughout the skirmish, the Norwegians fired about 200 machine gun shots, 50 shots from automatic weapons and two Carl Gustav RFK grenades. The PLO fired about ten times more shots from hand weapons, as well as eight gun grenades. Eventually the PLO gave up, and pledged not to fire at the Norwegians again.

She is Associate Professor at the University of Illinois, in the Department of Anthropology. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on sexual harassment in science and academia. == Education == Clancy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree cum laude from Harvard University in 2001, specialising in Biological Anthropology and Women's Studies. She obtained her PhD in Anthropology from Yale University in 2007. == Career and research == In 2006, Clancy worked as a lecturer at Yale University. One year later, she joined Harvard University as Preceptor Faculty and Associate at the Department of Anthropology. She has worked at the University of Illinois since 2008, where she started as a lecturer and now works as an Associate Professor in Anthropology. Clancy currently leads the Clancy Lab group within the Laboratory for Evolutionary Endocrinology at the University of Illinois. She is also Co-Director of the Laboratory. Since September 2016, Clancy has hosted the Period Podcast, where she discusses issues regarding the science of menstrual cycles. This theme is connected to her early research. === Fertility research === Clancy's fertility research focuses on menstruation and variability in endometrial function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women. Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the uterus. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the luteal phase). Clancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase. Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation. Clancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation. Clancy's later research focuses on primate development. She has also dispelled the myth that women's menstrual cycles can become synchronised due to their close social bonds. === Sexual harassment research === Clancy is part of a team of anthropologists who led the \\"Survey of Academic Field Experiences\\" study, also known as SAFE13. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and sexual assault in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists. A follow-up study (known as \\"SAFE 2\\"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation. The SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform. On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science. === Racism and gender harassment === In 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey. The research involved an online survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists. It is the first study of its kind in the physical sciences, and it is the first large study to examine both gender and racial harassment in academic science. The study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment. The study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women. Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report. The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment. The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists. The study raises questions about bystander interventions, given the hostile culture towards women of colour is evident to witnesses, who do not feel empowered to act. Clancy served on the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2018 consensus report entitled \\"Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\\" == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American women scientists Category:Women anthropologists Category:Sexual harassment in the United States Category:American anthropologists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"Kathryn B.

The Munich fire department is divided into a professional department with approximately 1500 fire fighters staffing a total of 10 fire stations (German: Feuerwache) located strategically throughout the city to meet the legal aid period of 10 Minutes, and a volunteer fire department, whose approximately 1,050 members are organized in 22 companies. Each year, the Munich Fire Department responds to about 80,000 calls (of which are about 70% medical calls). The volunteers respond to about 3,500 calls annually. This makes the Munich Fire Department the third largest fire department as well as the largest municipal fire department in Germany. == History  Precursor === As with most fire departments in Germany, the first units were founded by gymnastics clubs. In 1848, a gymnastics club volunteered itself as gymnastics fire department to serve the city. Due to the overall political situation (revolution 1848) and the generally prevailing reservations against clubs, this dissolved again in 1850. === Founding === After several attempts, especially in the 1860s, which failed mainly du to financial reasons, the volunteer fire department Munich was founded on 10 September 1866 through the work of Julius Knorr, J. B. Sartorius and city architect Arnold Zenetti. A major fire accident on 9 July 1866 in house No. 10 on the Schützenstraße (today Dachauer Straße 40) and the noted lack of necessary push ladders were the most serious argument that forced the city to action. The first commander was the master builder, Reinhold Hirschberg. At that time, seven fire stations were available within the city. === To 1900 === Through the incorporation of neighboring communities (today's districts), Munich grew steadily, and with it the fire brigade. To which, for example, in 1877 Sendling became part of the state capital. The already existing fire brigades were integrated into the Munich fire department as so-called companies (Sendling VI Company) (see also the section Sendling, below). As early as 1870, due to the rapidly growing population, a permanent night watch was set up in Munich and assigned to the volunteer fire department. Eight years later, the city of Munich decided to set up a permanent guard watch. Therefore, the Munich professional fire brigade was founded on 1 July 1879, their former main watch station was housed at Heumarkt (later St.-Jakobs-Platz). === 1900 to 1945 === Commemorative medal of the VIII. Company of the Munich Voluntary Fire department from the year 1912; awarded to deserving founding members In 1904, the professional fire department moved into the new and still existing main fire station on Blumenstraße (today An der Hauptfeuerwache). By the end of 1913, all horse teams were abolished at the Munich Fire Department and it completely switched to vehicles with gasoline engines. This made Munich the first city to fully automate its fire department fleet. In the course of the motorization, thirteen companies of the volunteer fire brigade were merged into 6 sections. By the end of 1921, the volunteer fire department had 471 active members. Between the war years, other communities around Munich were incorporated and their fire brigades were incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department. Creating only one volunteer fire department in Munich, which maintained several locations. Before the Second World War, the volunteer fire department had a staff of 1300 man. === After 1945 === The dense network of firefighting squads of the volunteer fire department, which was created in the city center before the Second World War, was dissolved by the occupying powers, for example the Firefighting squad 3 / company 6 (Firefighting Squad Laim). It was not until 1947 that the reconstruction of the professional fire brigade was possible. As a result, some departments were directly re- established (more or less continued) others, for example, the abbot Waldtrudering (1957) was rebuilt much later. Also new departments emerged such as Sendling (see below) or the Department Center (1967 founded as the firefighting squad city center), which replaced existing units from before the war or restructured them. In 1972, through the course of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, the silent alarm was introduced, until that time the volunteer fire department was alerted through a siren on the roofs of the fire stations. Since the 1990s, the volunteer fire department is alerted to all emergency operations (in which the statutory auxiliary period applies) simultaneously with the professional fire department. In the late 1970s, a novel type of aerial ladder was developed in a cooperation between the Munich Fire Department and the fire engine manufacturer Magirus-Deutz, the so-called low-profile design. The series of vehicles built and ordered by the Munich Fire Department in 1980, in 12 different styles, had a height of only 2.85 meters and was therefore significantly lower than conventional turntable ladders with heights between 3.20 and 3.30 meters. As a result, it was possible to reach low gateways and backyards, for which conventional turntable ladders were too high. A vehicle width of only 2.40 meters also provided for more maneuverability. Atego 1429) At the end of the 1980s, all firefighting squads and half-firefighting squads of the Munich volunteer fire department were renamed into departments, such as firefighting squad Michaeliburg into Michaeliburg Department. With the procurement of the 21 LF 16/12, a separate vehicle was procured for the FF for the first time, which could also be used alone for a first strike by fire or THL missions. In 2010, a total of 58 uniform aid firefighting vehicles 20/16 were procured for the volunteer and professional fire departments in Munich. === Future === The partly from the 1970s originating fire stations and fire department houses are to be overtaken in the course of an extensive renovation program. In addition, urgently needed new buildings, for example, Fire Station 4 (see also Fire Station 4, below) will be built. Due to the fast-growing areas to the west of Munich and the unfavorable situation of several stations, there will be a total of five new fire stations built in Munich. Since two existing stations are to be decided, it is expected that as of 2020, there will be a total of 12 sites of the professional fire department in the city area. == Professional fire department == Vehicle inscription The main burden of the missions is taken over by the Munich professional fire department. This consists of about 1,700 fire department officials. Every day, 300 officials at the ten fires and nine emergency medical watch stations are on 24-hour shifts and in constant alert. They attend to almost 5,000 firefighting missions, 21,000 technical assistance missions and more than 55,000 rescue operations per year. In addition, numerous missions and work from special groups, who are also recruited by the professional fire department. These groups come, for example, from the areas of water rescue, environmental protection, altitude rescue, emergency medical services, civil and disaster control, and the prevention of danger. In addition, the professional fire department operates an emergency pressure chamber and has also equipped each of its rescue fire trucks for use as a first-responder vehicle. In Munich, the professional fire department maintains ten fire stations, which are spread over the entire city and in which the special units are housed. In addition to the tasks of defensive fire protection, the remaining approximately 600 officials who do not work in shifts (so-called day service officials), in addition to administrative service and working in their own workshops, meet the tasks and activities of preventive fire protection. === Standard Firefighting-Convoy === The firefighting-platoon of the Munich fire department consists of a command vehicle (German: Einsatzleitwagen), two Munich fire and rescue engines (German: Hilfeleistungslöschfahrzeug), an aerial ladder (German: Drehleiter mit Korb), and an ambulance (German: Rettungswagen). Each firefighting-platoon is staffed with minimum 18 firefighters (1 platoon chief, 1 chief assistant, 2 captains, 3 engine operators and 11 firefighters). This Firefighting-platoon forms the basic unit for fighting structural fires in Munich. === Fire Station 1 - Main Fire Station /Fire Department === Special extinguishing agent vehicle (SLF) of the Fire Station 1 Main fire station () was inaugurated on 11 July 1904 as a replacement for the too small central fire houses, which were used for 25 years by the professional fire department. Their appearance was, apart from minor renovations, not changed to this date. The main fire station is also the home of the fire department of the county administrative department and also the fire station (FW) 1. This is the responsibility of the professional fire department, the volunteer fire department, the disaster and civil defense in the city of Munich. In addition, the fire department also works out deployment plans and release order, distributes resources to the stations in the city, manages the integrated control center (ILSt), decides on hiring, procurement of input material and the maintenance of the fire stations. Furthermore, it is active in preventive fire and danger protection and does the administrative work. At the main fire station, a special extinguishing agent vehicle (SLF) is stationed next to the fire engine. Here are also the leading vehicles of the inspection service, including the service of the directorate as well as the head of the organization and the emergency response service. Also, the children's NEF, and the newborn ambulance are housed here. The station is also assigned to an ambulance, which is not stationed at the fire station, but in the inner-city hospital. Since 1979, the public fire department museum Munich has been located in the service building. === Fire Station 2 – Sendling === Fire Station 2 Fire station 2 () was put into operation in the fall of 1967, after the old fire station 2 on Boschetsrieder Straße had become too small and could no longer meet the growing demands. The fire station is attached to a respiratory protection and a hoses repair shop as well as the fire department school. In particular, the inspection and maintenance of respiratory protective equipment, hoses, jump rescue equipment, fire department fabric and protective clothing is carried out by this fire station. The fire department school has its own fleet, an exercise hall and a fire simulation system (gas-fired). Currently in Sendling in addition to a fire engine, a device car respiratory/radiation protection, an environment rescue vehicle, a hoses truck 2000, a tank fire engine 24/48, an aerial ladder 37 and two hookloaders are stationed. The vehicles of the Analytical Task Force are also located here. The station is also assigned an emergency ambulance vehicle, which is not stationed at the fire station, but at Klinikum Großhadern. === Fire Station 3 – Westend === Fire Station 3 Fire station 3 in Westend () opened on 28 October 1983, replacing the old fire stations 3 and 8, which were each occupied by a group, as a new fire station 3, in which an engine is housed. The fire station 3 is located in the immediate vicinity of Theresienhöhe and Theresienwiese and offers the possibility to strengthen their station at any time. In addition, this station has a large sports hall and a practice tower, and since 1997 an integrated control center. Since then it has been a group station with special vehicles. In 2017, the control center moved to the new FW 4, so that the FW 3 can be \\"moved\\" in the long term more in the western direction ( Pasing ). At present, a Half-platoon (nominal staffing 1/1/10/12), consisting of a command vehicle 1, an aerial ladder with basket 23-12, a rescue fire engine 20/16 and a tank fire engine 24/48 are housed at the fire station.

It is located at the Heßstraße 120, on the site of the former Civil Protection Center, in the Munich district of Schwabing-West, but still carries the nickname Schwabing. Construction costs for the new station amounted to 85 million euros and was planned and set up as a large security base in accordance with the \\"Fire Department Final Plan 2020\\" (see \\"future\\" section). In 2017, the dispatch and control center of fire station 3 moved into the new building. The area of service of fire station 4 includes the city districts Schwabing, Maxvorstadt, Neuhausen, the Englischer Garten, Freimann and parts of the Lehel.

Former fire station 4 The former fire station 4 () was put into operation in 1970. The six-storey building housed until 1984, the garment workshop, which was relocated to Neuperlach due to a lack of space. Since then, the premises have been used as a station and continue to serve as service quarters for the officers. In addition, the station is to serve as an interim location for the fire engine 1 during the renovation work on the fire station 1. === Fire Station 5 – Ramersdorf === Fire station 5 () of Ramersdorf in the east of Munich was inaugurated in December 1951 and two years later an extension was added to house the vehicle repair shop, which was moved during the construction to Neuperlach. Also, in 1953, an exercise diving tank was built and in 1964 a respiratory workshop was established in Ramersdorf. The fire station Ramersdorf is the seat of the technical maintenance department and electrical installations, which carry out construction work on the fire stations and houses of the Munich fire department, and the department of extinguishing water supply. This controls all public fire extinguishing water outlets in Munich, as well as dry fire water pipes in U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems and larger structures. All metrological, medical and respiratory equipment procured by the fire department have been tested and selected in Ramersdorf. In addition, emergency medical and rescue vehicles are disinfected here. Another special feature of this fire station is the overpressure treatment chamber located there, a diver relay which can be brought via helicopters for use, since the sports field belonging to the station is also used as a heliport. As part of the large-scale restructuring and modernization of the Munich Fire Department, the second Civil Protection Center in Munich (next to the new FW 4) is to be built in Ramersdorf. Large capacity ambulance (GRTW) Munich In addition to the mandatory fire engine in Ramersdorf also a large-capacity ambulance, a rescue vehicle, a water rescue equipment vehicle, a respiratory equipment/radiation protection vehicle, an aerial ladder with basket 12/9, an infect rescue vehicle, various cars and trucks for the affiliated workshops, as well as the pressure chamber are housed.

The NEF in the Bogenhausen hospital is occupied alternately with the fire station 8. In addition, an ambulance from the Aicher Union ambulance (occupied daily 8:00 am to 12:00 pm) is stationed at the Fire Station 5. === Fire Station 6 – Pasing === Fire station in Pasing () began its service in 1979. It includes a workshop and warehouse building next to the station house. In this fire station, a department for preventive fire protection is housed, which carries out regular safety inspections and also gives advice in the case of identified deficiencies. In addition, the entire rescue medical education and training of the Munich Fire Department takes place in Pasing, which includes the training of rescue workers, paramedics, paramedic assistants including rescue assistants. In addition, also first-aid courses and training on automated external defibrillators are offered. In such cases, the fire station also works closely with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in the further education of medical students, emergency physicians and other rescue service employees. Furthermore, one of the three respiratory protection workshops is located in Pasing, as well as the special equipment warehouse (warehouse for emergency aid). The latter mainly contains cots, sandbags, pumps, food containers and other material that can be acquired in a very short time. In addition to the \\"classic\\" fire fighting vehicles found at the fire station, Pasing also houses various transport trucks, such as a roll off and multi bucket trucks, forklifts, wheel loaders and a fire department crane KW50. Furthermore, a heavy rescue vehicle, a device car for respirator/radiation protection, a large capacity ambulance, a water rescue trolley for the diver unit, as well as a tank fire truck 20/40-SL and a trolley \\"Großlüfter\\" (industrial fan) are stationed there.

Fire Station 6 also has an intensive incubator for relocating newborns using RTW. Furthermore, training takes place at the fire station 6 for fire fighter divers and diving instructors. === Fire Station 7 – Milbertshofen === Fire station 7 was procured in December 1960 as a group station and expanded in 1964 to an engine station. At that time, a workshop was also set up, in which the central carpentry is housed. This manufactures furniture and fittings for the professional fire department and is staffed by both officials of the station, as well as other employees. Housed in the fire station Milbertshofen is a Munich fire and rescue engine, a hoses tanker 2000, and a small alarm vehicle. In addition, an emergency ambulance vehicle (NEF Neuherberg) is occupied at the \\"Helmholtzzentrum\\" site. An ambulance (NAW Nymphenburg) located at the \\"Klinikum Dritter Orden\\" is staffed together with personnel of fire station 3. Fire Station 7 also houses a 24-hour ambulance (RTW) ambulance station of the \\"Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Deutschland\\". === Fire Station 8 – Föhring === Fire station 8 occupies a special position among the Munich fire stations. It was built in 1995 on a city-owned property outside the city limits, so as to be able to protect the neighboring municipalities and especially a neighboring combined heat and power plant. The Fire station 8 is designed as a half force platoon station, which also has a practice tower and a sports field. In addition, the height rescue group is stationed there. Fire station 8 houses a half force platoon (with nominal staffing 1/1/10/12) consisting of an ELW, an HLF and a DLK 23/12, as well as a tank fire engine 24/48 and the height rescue equipment vehicle are housed.

It houses an independent repair shop, which maintains and repairs the vehicles of the professional and volunteer fire departments. In addition, there is also a clothing workshop in Neuperlach, in which the personal protective equipment of the emergency personnel is stored, mended, washed and issued. A department of preventive fire protection is also represented in Neuperlach. At present, the fire station 9 has a reduced half-force consisting of a rescue service group vehicle 20/16, an aerial ladder with basket 23-12, and a tank fire engine 20/40 SL. Furthermore, a small alarm vehicle and an ambulance are there. As special vehicles are also a fire-fighting crane 50 t, a large fan device vehicle, an all-terrain turntable ladder and a Hubrettungsbühne 53 housed in Neuperlach. The emergency ambulance has been at the fire station 9 since the beginning of 2010. === Fire Station 10 – Riem === Fire Station 10 – Riem Since March 1998, fire station 10 is located on the site of the former Munich-Riem Airport. This was required by the new fair and the adjacent \\"Messestadt Riem\\". In particular, it also has an exercise yard and a riser tower. There is also a workshop for chainsaws and fire extinguishers, which, among other things, carries out the mandatory bi-annual inspections. Fire station 10 currently houses a half force platoon (ELW, HLF, DLK) and a special fire engine, an ambulance and an emergency response vehicle (since July 2010) are stationed there. During the operation of the trade fair, the station is reinforced by a command vehicle and another rescue fire engine. == Volunteer fire department == The voluntary fire department takes on a support function in Munich for the professional fire department. It helps out in the areas of fire protection, technical assistance and especially in the extended civil protection. In principle, it is called in for all operations involving personal injury. It is divided into 21 operational units, with 20 located in the outskirts of North, East, South and West, and one in the city center. As special units, it operates the ICT group, the flight marshal squadron, the ABC force and the catering squad of the Munich fire department. The volunteer fire department is affiliated to the fire department. The head of the professional fire department or the fire department director (fire chief) works alongside the city fire council (commander), which in turn is supported by the city fire inspector and the four area leaders (city fireman). Their command (city fire inspection) is located in the fire station 4 (Schwabing). The Munich volunteer fire department was founded in 1866 as a result of a severe fire with fatalities. It was able to fall back on a fire station, which was built in 1794 and used by committed craftsmen and urban workers for fire protection tasks. In December 1870, additional volunteer fire brigades were integrated into today's disengagement area of the department city center. In the 1890s, other towns were added to the city of Munich, whose fire brigades were incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department. === City Center (Downtown) Department === Former fire station Abt. Stadtmitte (former police driving school) The department city center was re-established in 1969 as the fire group city center, although fire service units already existed in the city center (see History above). It was included in the alerting plan of the professional fire department in the middle of 1971 and could be reached by phone, to set off with their two vehicles. The following years, the already grown group of over 50 men, was additionally equipped with radio detectives and received another emergency vehicle. Also, at the Olympic Games, the station participated in the constant watch. With the incorporation of the air defense service in 1973 for the extended civil protection, the department city center received a new home, the Center for Civil Protection. However, the department was provisionally housed for several years in the former buildings of the police driving school on Dachauer Straße. In 1984, the department, which grew to over 80 members, took over the (first) hazmat unit of the city of Munich. The department is directly under the command of the volunteer fire department, its field of operations mainly covers the area within the middle ring. Since in this area all fire stations are located except stations 6 and 8 to 10, the City Center Division is only alarmed on special occasions or when a second platoon (2nd departure) is needed. Currently, the department city center has four Munich fire and rescue engines, a Respiratory and Radiation Protection (air unit) vehicle, an NBC reconnaissance vehicle, a decontamination unit, a two-load interchangeable vehicle (WLF) with two containers (decontamination of civilians, water transport system). As trailers, there are stationed a trailer with industrial water vacuum cleaners, a light unit trailer and decontamination trailer. A multi-purpose vehicle (MZF) completes the vehicle fleet. On Saturday, 21 May 2016, the department city center moved into its new fire station on Heßstraße 120. The VFD station is located in the rear building of fire station 4 (Schwabing) and is the first to be stationed together with the professional fire department in Munich. === Area north ===  Department Feldmoching  The Feldmoching department currently has a 20/16 rescue fire engine, an LF 16/12 and an LF 20 KatS.  Department Harthof  Fire fighting group vehicle 16/12 (Munich model, manufacture year 2003) The exact date of the founding of the former volunteer fire department Harthof can not be identified, but is dated to the year 1922. Only after the Second World War, which destroyed the structure of the Munich fire department, and led to a new start-up as a fire department Harthof of the Munich fire department in January 1948. This was planned to support the fire fighting in Feldmoching, which also received there fire station in 1950. A year later, the Munich Fire Department granted a request for independence of the fire fighting group. In the following years, the fire fighting group Harthof was further trained and expanded until 1979,when it was then recognized as a department and attained its present fire station. Today, the Harthof department is active with an Assistance Fire department vehicle 20/16, a 16/12 fire engine and an MZF, to which they can attach an e-sucker trailer if required.  Department Freimann  The department Freimann, with over 35 active men and woman, was founded in May 1870 as an independent fire department and later incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department. Today, the comrades partake in about 200 missions a year, making the department one of the most frequently alerted at the Munich volunteer fire department. Their fields of application include, among others, a large industrial area, the Allianz Arena, a large motorway section and the subway. Since 1995, with the appropriate indication, the department has been alarmed at the same time as the professional fire depeartment. The fleet currently consists of a rescue service group vehicle 20/16, a fire engine 16/12, a tank fire engine 16/25 and a traffic safety trailer.  Department Oberföhring  The volunteer fire department Oberföhring was founded in January 1870 and combined in 1907 with the neighboring forces from Daglfing, Unterföhring and Ismaning. When Oberföhring was incorporated into the city of Munich in 1913, the Oberföhring Fire Department was included as a 10th Division in the Munich Fire Department. Their first motorized fire engine, making them equally compatible with the other fire service units in Munich, reached the department Oberföhring only in 1932. At the time of National Socialism, the members of the volunteer fire department were integrated into the fire protection police or the \\"Wehrmacht\\", which meant the temporary end of this department. The reconstruction of this fire service department took place immediately after the end of the Second World War, even during the occupation. After the takeover of the civil protection in Munich there was a restructuring of the fire department, so that the department Oberföhring since then, together with the departments Riem and Trudering, formed the fire department readiness in the area Ost1. In 1979, the department Oberföhring received a new fire station, in which the vehicle hall could accommodate three fire engines. Following a change in the organization of the Munich volunteer fire department, the Oberföhring department has been assigned to the North division since 2004. The Oberföhring department owns two fire stations. One of them in Oberföhring, in which a rescue fire vehicle 20/16 (OF 49-1), a fire engine 16/12 (OF 40-1) and a multi-purpose vehicle (OF 11-1) are housed. The other fire station is located in Englschalking in which another aid fire engine 20/16 (OF 49-2) and an LF 20 KatS (OF 41-1) is stationed. === Area east ===  Department Riem  The royal district office Munich country gave, in 1874, all municipalities the order to set up volunteer fire departments. As a result, the local mayor of Dornach-Riem convened a foundation meeting on 22 November at the Gasthof Alter Wirt in Riem. All citizens and peasants of the 398-resident community were called upon to found a volunteer fire department. Spontaneously, 46 men agreed to join. In 1937, the district Riem of the community Dornach Riem was incorporated into the city of Munich. Munich received a population increase of approx. 1000 inhabitants and an area increase of 657.29 hectares. After about 62 years of community and good neighborliness, the paths of the volunteer fire department Dornach-Riem now parted ways. The existing volunteer fire department in the district Riem was assigned as Halblöschzug 19 (a small size fire engine) of the Munich volunteer fire department and equipped with a Sauer-Löschfahrzeug. The Riem department currently owns an HLF 20/16, a fire engine LF 16/12 and a crew transport vehicle (MTF).  Department Trudering  Volunteer Fire Department Munich, Department Trudering In Trudering in 1874, the volunteer fire department was founded and rebuilt in 1919 after the First World War. At this time, the districts Waldtrudering and Michaeliburg founded fire fighting groups that could support the fire department Trudering. As early as 1925, the fire department received an alarm siren, with which the firefighters could be alerted for missions. A large part of the comrades fell victim to the Second World War, the emergency vehicles were destroyed in the invasion of the Americans. Nevertheless, the fire department was re-established in 1945, so they could again provide for the safety in their area. Also, at the 1972 Summer Olympics, important tasks were given to the department Trudering. In 1982, a new fire station could be moved into, so that the previously housed separately vehicles were now available in one place. Today, the Trudering department has a HLF 20/16, a fire engine 16/12, a 2000 hoses truck with crew space and, since 2015, a multi-purpose vehicle for transporting equipment and personnel. There are currently 30 firefighters, including 4 women, in the Trudering department.  Department Michaeliburg  Volunteer fire department Munich, department Michaeliburg At the end of the 1980s, the department Michaeliburg was founded from the half-brigade of the 17th fire fighting group. With 45 active members, the department, together with Perlach, Riem, Trudering, Waldperlach and Waldtrudering belongs to the East area of the Munich fire departments. With a rescue fire truck, a fire engine 16/12 and a multi-purpose vehicle, the department is called on an average of 90 missions a year.  Department Perlach  The Volunteer Fire department Perlach was founded in 1869 and was incorporated in 1930. In the course of this, the name volunteer fire department Perlach changed to volunteer fire department Munich, Department Perlach. Today, it has an Assistance Fire department vehicle 20/16, a fine engine 16/12, a 16/25 tanker and a traffic safety trailer.  Department Waldperlach  The Department Waldperlach was founded on 3 April 1927, under the direction of Karl Freiherr von Stockhausen. After the Second World War, the fire department was reorganized by six of the founding members in 1949. The department currently owns a fire engine 16/12, a tank fire engine 16/25, a multi-purpose vehicle, and the standard rescue fire engine 20/16 of the Munich Fire Department. In June 2016, an LF 20 KatS procured by the Federal Ministry of the Interior was put into active service. In addition, the troops were assigned so-called external load containers for firefighting from the air (with helicopters e.g. the police helicopter squadron Bavaria) type SEMAT 900 (2 tanks with a capacity of 900 l each) and SEMAT 5000 (2 tanks with a capacity of 5000 l each), The department therefore supports the marshalling squadron of the Munich Fire Department. The equipment also includes a thermal imaging camera Evolution 5000 by MSA-Auer. The, after 20-years of planning, newly built fire station is located in the \\"Gefilde 4\\" on the corner of Putzbrunner Straße, near the fire station 9 (Neuperlach). The move took place in October 2006 and was officially inaugurated at the 80th anniversary celebration in July 2007. At present, 41 active firemen and women work in this department.  Department Waldtrudering  Volunteer Fire Department Munich, Department Waldtrudering The exact founding date of the firefighting group in Waldtrudering can unfortunately no longer be determined, since all documents were destroyed in the Second World War. However, in 1921 the history of the Trudering fire department mentions the Waldtrudering fire department, which was an important addition for the fire protection in the former municipality Trudering. In 1923, the official founding took place as an independent fire department. The Waldtrudering fire department then owned a hand pump, which had to be pulled by the crew. This was housed in a shed next to the former water tower. In 1930, an old hoses tank trailer with a motor- driven pump was purchased, which was pulled by a truck. Since the shed was too small to house this, it had to be enlarged. On 1 December 1931, the following was noted in the registration form when the Freiwillige Feuerwehr Waldtrudering was admitted to the Bavarian Fire Department Association: Number of members: * I. technical group (Steiger): 10 men * II. Technical group (hoses men): 18 men * Signalers: 2 men * Control group: 10 men Number of devices: * two-piece ladder with support bars: 1 piece * Hydrant car: 2 pieces * small hoses: 1 piece * Pressure hoses: 300 meters After incorporation of the town (to Munich) in April 1932, the fire service was renamed the Voluntary Fire Department Munich-Waldtrudering, Halblöschzug 18 (a small size fire engine). After the war, there was no interest in the re-establishment of the fire department, until the proposal was made in 1957. At that time, the alarm was signaled by a siren, which was replaced in the early 1970s by the silent alarm system. Since 1992 the department is alarmed together with the professional fire department. The department Waldtrudering is currently active with a rescue fire engine 20/16 (WT 40.1), a fire engine 16/12 (WT 40.8), and a MZF (WT 11.1). The department, which currently has 43 active members (including 6 female persons), is located in the area of Fire stations 9 and 10. === Area south ===  Department Forstenried  The Forstenrieder Fire Department consists of 29 active firemen and women (as of 12/2010). The area of operation extends from Boschetsrieder Straße in the north to the Autobahnring (belt highway) in the south and from Drygalski Allee in the east to the city limits in the west. The main tasks in the disengagement area are technical assistance, prevention and fire protection. In the case of major incidents, such as severe weather or major fires, however, the volunteer fire department Forstenried moves out throughout the city. The fire station is located in the Forstenrieder Allee 177, the fleet consists of a rescue service group vehicle 20/16, a fire engine 16/12 and a tank fire engine 16/25 with traffic safety trailer. The rations truck, which serves to provide for the personnel during long-term operations, consisting of kitchen wagons and food trailers, is stationed at Gmunder Straße in the Civil Protection Center.  Department Grosshadern  By the delivery contract of a fire-extinguishing sprayer of 29 November 1859, the existence of an organized fire department took place for the first time. The company Kgl. Hoffeuerhaus Dominick Kirchmair handed over an extinguishing sprayer with a double pumping station. It was used by 6 to 8 men and threw a steady stream of water up to 70 feet. The price of the sprayer was agreed with 500 guilders. The old sprayer was apparently built so solid or so little in use that only after 30 years, another extinguisher had to be commissioned. The new device was operated by at least 10 men and costed 1200 marks. Under the \\"Most High Protectorate of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria\\", the newly founded fire department in Großhadern at the Bavarian State Fire Brigade Association was registered on 8 September 1892. Großhadern was incorporated into Munich in 1938 and so the fire department Großhadern became the department Großhadern of the Munich volunteer fire department. Making the department Großhadern, one of the youngest departments of the Munich volunteer fire department. Today, the department Großhadern is active with a 20/16 rescue fire engine, a fire engine 16/25 and a multi-purpose vehicle (MZF). The active area of the volunteer fire department Großhadern includes the neighborhoods: Hadern, Blumenau and parts of Laim and Pasing. In the disembarkation area is the Großhadern hospital, the Augustinum, various laboratories of the LMU, 5 underground stations, as well as several schools. The Großhadern department is located in the fire stations 2,3 and 6 and is deployed in major urban areas throughout the entire city of Munich.  Department Sendling  Field of application of the department Sendling In Sendling, as a result of a severe fire, a Volunteer fire department was founded in 1869. This was incorporated, with the incorporation of Sendlings in 1877, in the Munich fire department and was therefore the first outside Munich-based fire department of Munich. In 1889, it was decided to found another company near the Schlachthof München (slaughterhouse), which, like the company from Thalkirchen, was combined with the fire department in Sendling during the reorganization of the Munich volunteer fire department. The vehicles were housed in the fire station of the Sendlinger fire department, while the comrades in the slaughterhouse district and in Thalkirchen were placed at assembly stations, where they could be picked up by the professional fire department. During the Second World War, this fire station and all the equipment of the fire department were destroyed in a bombing raid. In 1972, with the comrades of the fire department Großhadern created a fire group Waldfriedhofviertel, which would move out together with Großhadern. This fire group received a fire brigade vehicle in 1974 and was able to move out independently, and through time the group allocated more vehicles. Only in November 1980, this department was again named Sendling, after they had received a new fire station in the Zillertalstraße. Equipment vehicle In Sendling are currently two rescue fire engines 20/16, two equipment vehicles, a team transport vehicle and three motorcycles stationed as Despatch riders.  Department Solln  Fire station Solln The volunteer fire department Solln, founded in 1873, was later integrated into the Munich fire department. Today, the department Solln is active with a rescue fire engine 20/16 and two fire engines 16/12. === Area west ===  Department Allach  The Department Allach exists since 1874 and was founded under the name Volunteer Fire Department Allach. In 1938, the incorporation of Allach into the city of Munich took place and from then, for more than sixty years, the independent volunteer fire department Allach was the Fire squad 27 of the Munich volunteer fire department. On 1 June 1946, the roadhouse Trinkl was elected as the first fire squadron leader after the war. At this time, 15 active firefighters still belonged to the fire squad Allach. In 1974, the department Allach celebrated its 100th anniversary. The Allach department currently has an HLF 20/16 rescue fire engine, two LF 16/12 firefighting vehicles and one MZF multi-purpose vehicle. The active team includes over 50 comrades. Making the Allach department one of the strongest personnel departments of the Munich volunteer fire department. The youth fire department of the department offers about 10 young people, aged 12 to 17 years, various leisure activities with a strong reference to fire-related topics. On average, the Allach department handles 150 missions a year, with technical assistance dealing with severe weather damage and fire fighting making up the bulk of the alarms.  Department Aubing  The first reports of an Löschmaschine (fire apparatus) in Aubing date as far back as 1856. The official founding of the Volunteer fire department Aubing is 1 January 1882. In the course of the incorporation of Aubing to Munich, the fire department was taken over as the fire squad 29 of the Munich volunteer fire department. Location of the department Aubing is the fire station at Ubostraße 11. Their active area includes Aubing, Aubing East, West Cross, Neuaubing and Freiham. In addition, there is the Moosschwaige, the Aubinger Lohe and Bundesautobahn 99 with the Aubinger Tunnel. The fleet currently includes a multi-purpose vehicle (fire department), a rescue fire engine 20/16, a fire engine 20 for civil protection and a fire engine 16/12. In addition, the \\"Association of Friends of the Volunteer Fire Department Aubing\\" pocess an Horse Drawn Fire Engines. This is traditionally used at the Wiesn opening, in historical uniforms. From the association were also AED and thermal imaging cameras procured. This means that the HLF can be used as a First Responder vehicle, as is the case with almost all departments of the FF München (prerequisite: personnel with training as paramedics are on the vehicle). The youth group of the department is integrated into the area West.  Department Moosach  The Moosach department of the Munich volunteer fire department can now look back on more than 125 years of history. Since the middle of the 19th century, there was a mandatory municipal fire department in the former village of Moosach near Munich. This was replaced by the founding of the volunteer fire department in Moosach on 8 April 1879, Paul Berthold sen. was the first commander. As part of the incorporation of the village Moosach to Munich in 1913, the volunteer fire department Moosach was incorporated into the municipal fire department of the city of Munich as Division 8. Out of 14 active members drafted in the First World War, only four returned at the end of the war. On 25 December 1925, the department was the first Munich volunteer fire department to receive a motorized sprayer with a three-stage Magirus high-pressure centrifugal pump and a capacity of 800 to 1000 liters / minute. On 21 April 1931, the Moosach department put the first automobile vehicle into active service at the Munich volunteer fire department. In 1933, the Moosach department was divided up and integrated into the general fire protection police. In the spring of 1945, the re-establishment of the Department 8 of the Munich volunteer fire department took place under commander Josef Heinrich. In 1954, the 75th anniversary of its founding was celebrated with a flag-consecration. In 1972, the so-called silent alerts were replaced by radio alarm receiver at the Moosach department, the first department of the Munich volunteer fire department to do so and it was introduced on the occasion of the Olympics. On 19 March 1979, the present fire station was handed over to the department Moosach. The old fire station was demolished in 1980. From 4 to 6 May 1979, the 100th anniversary of its founding was celebrated. In 1982, the Moosach department founded the first youth group of the Munich fire department, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2007. In 1993, Munich's first female fire fighter started her service in the Moosach department and successfully completed her basic training. On 2 May 2004, the Moosach department celebrated its 125th anniversary. The Moosach department currently has a 20/16 rescue fire engine, a 16/12 fire engine and a multi-purpose vehicle.  Department Obermenzing  The department Obermenzing currently has a fire engine 16/12 and a rescue fire engine 20/16 and a crew transport vehicle.  Department Langwied- Lochhausen  The founding of the volunteer fire department Langwied- Lochhausen took place in 1878, during the tenure of Simon Heitmeier as mayor or Lochhausen . The first commander of the Langwied-Lochhausen fire department was Martin Naßl, who was elected at the constituent meeting on 5 March 1878. After the incorporation of Langwied-Lochhausen as the 40th municipality of the City of Munich on 1 April 1942, the formerly independent fire department of the village as fire brigade 30 was incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department. Today the department Langwied-Lochhausen consists of about 30 active fire service providers (including the youth fire brigade), which can rely on a high-quality fleet and equipment pool. * HLF type \\"Munich\\": In the middle of 2011, the department was one of the last to received the standard vehicle of the Munich fire department Munich as first responders. Amenities include an additional AED and advanced medical equipment. * LF 16/12: Standard vehicle of the FF Munich which is additionally equipped with thermal imaging cameras, AED, and pulse oximeter. * TLF 16/25: Additionally loaded with an E-sucker and optionally with a fast-action boat and associated equipment for water and ice rescue. In addition, it is used as a towing vehicle for the VSA (traffic safety trailer) of the department, which is responsible for the area A8 / A99. * MZF: The MB Sprinter, which was taken over from the US Army, was converted into a fire engine by the comrades themselves. It serves beyond response support to the youth fire brigade as well as the association work. In addition to the mentioned vehicles, a multi-purpose trailer is available, which can be used for a wide variety of transports.  Department Ludwigsfeld  The department Ludwigsfeld is located in the area west. Currently, Ludwigsfeld has a 16/12 fire engine and a 20/16 rescue fire engine, as well as a utility truck, which is also used as a driving school vehicle to train new drivers within the Volunteer fire department. === Youth fire department === Munich Youth Fire Brigade was founded in 1982 in the Moosach department of the Munich Volunteer fire department and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2007. The youth group is now an integral part of the Munich volunteer fire department. It is divided into five groups, in which around 250 boys and girls, between the ages of 12 and 18, actively deal with issues pertaining to firefighting. The members of the youth fire brigade are trained in fire-fighting technology and first aid, additionally there is an extensive leisure program. == Training == The professional fire department contenders are trained in correspondence with the current national German regulations for example the transnational agreements, including those of the Institut der Feuerwehr Nordrhein-Westfalen (Institute of the Fire department North Rhine- Westphalia), depending on the qualification level (two to four). At the fire department school on FW2, training is mainly provided in the courses BI (basic course) and BIII (group leader course or equivalent courses after the administrative reform). The fire engine driver training courses (BIV) take place at the Feuerwehrschule Geretsried (SFSG). The training of the volunteer fire department is carried out by the Training and Education Center (TAZ) in cooperation with the professional fire department. Except for special subjects, all courses up to and including the qualification level Group Leader (FIII) are offered in Munich. The basic training of FF München extends over a period of 3 years and lasts a total of 350 hours in a variety of different courses (see FwDV2 233 hours). It is completed with the qualification to Squadron Leader (FII) and the promotion to leading fireman / woman. == Emergency medical service == The emergency medical service in the city and in the districts of Munich was founded in 1966 by the professional fire department and is still in operation today (\\"Rettungsdienstzweckverband München\\"). Since then, nine hospitals provide a physician specializing in internal medicine, surgery or anesthesia for service on the three ambulance and eight emergency doctor vehicles. The Munich emergency doctors are called out about 80 times a day. === Emergency doctor location === The vehicles for the emergency medical service are stationed in the Surgical Clinic of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich city center (Florian Munich middle 70/1), in the hospital Großhadern (Florian Munich Großhadern 76/1), in the surgical hospital Munich south (Florian Munich Thalkirchen 76 / 1) in Thalkirchen, in Klinikum Schwabing (Florian München Schwabing 70/1), on Feuerwache 10 (Florian München Riem 76/1), in Klinikum München Pasing (Florian München Pasing 76/1), in the Klinikum Dritter Orden (Florian München Nymphenburg 70/1), the Helmholtz Zentrum München (Florian Neuherberg 76/1), the town hospital Bogenhausen (Florian München Bogenhausen 76/1), the fire station 9 (Florian München Neuperlach 76/1) and the fire station of the volunteer fire department Ottobrunn (Florian Ottobrunn 76/1). In addition, an ambulance is stationed on the rescue helicopter Christoph 1 (location Klinikum Harlaching). The ITH Christoph München, which is mainly used for transfers, is also available 24 hours a day for emergencies at the Klinikum Großhadern, which is staffed by two pilots, an emergency doctor and an air rescue assistant with intensive nursing additional training. Newborn emergency doctor with incubator Children emergency medical vehicle, 2019 One defibrillator (AED) is on each rescue fire engine of the Munich fire department. === NEF or NAW === Most German cities have switched to a rendezvous system; meaning the emergency doctor is brought to the place of deployment with a car, the emergency medical vehicle (NEF). Despite the results of a study commissioned by the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior (TRUST = Trend and Structure Analysis of the Rescue Service in Bavaria) and the corresponding recommendation of the Institute for Emergency Medicine of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, to change all Bavarian NAW into NEF, they continue to use the emergency ambulance (NAW) in addition to the emergency medical vehicle (NEF) in Munich. Since it is assumed that the NAW is critical to the rendezvous system in the densely populated neighborhoods, a NAW is still stationed at the Chirurgischen Klinik Innenstadt (Surgical Clinic), the Dritter Orden Hospital and the Schwabing Hospital. However, if the emergency doctor has significantly longer travel times, an ambulance or a first-responder vehicle of a fire station (Munich HLF) or a relief organization such as the Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz (Bavarian Red Cross) or Malteser Hilfsdienst(Malteser emergency service), is sent ahead. === Special Emergency Physicians === In addition to these normal emergency physicians, Munich also has a pediatric emergency doctor, who is additionally alerted by the Integrated Control Center in case of emergencies involving children under the age of 12. The doctor rotates weekly with one of the four children's hospitals in Munich. The vehicle Florian München 76/10 has its base at the main fire station, but is stationed at the hospital on duty. In addition, there is also a neonatal emergency doctor from the ranks of the children's specialists of the cardiological intensive care unit of the German Heart Center. Which is particularly alarmed in problem births - i.e., sudden birth at home or problematic births in clinics that have no neonatal intensive care unit. The neonatal emergency doctor and an intensive care worker are then picked up by the ambulance Florian München 70/30, who has a mobile incubator on board. Therefore, a newborn child can be supplied with intensive care until it is brought to a suitable children's intensive care unit. In addition, there is a toxicological emergency medical service in Munich, which can help in the case of poisoning emergencies on the spot with the two large rescue vehicles. === Involvement of the fire department in the rescue service === In Munich, the professional fire department takes over the emergency medical service, while ambulances are occupied by aid organizations and private rescue services. In addition, the ELRD (organizational leader ambulance service) is alternately provided by the BF (fire service) and the aid organizations. These include, in addition to the Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz (Bavarian Red Cross), the Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe, the Malteser Hilfsdienst (Malteser emergency service) and the \\"Arbeiter-Samariter- Bund\\" (workers good Samaritan association). The private emergency services, which have been involved in emergency rescue since 1998, are mainly represented by the two companies MKT and Aicher Ambulanz-Union - they provide 6 or 8 RTW, and which meanwhile also provide ELRD units. In addition, the company IMS occupies an ambulance. Some of the rescue vehicles of the relief organizations and private rescue services are also stationed at the fire stations of the professional fire department. At the fire stations, ambulances of the professional fire department are also stationed, which disengage with the fire engine each time. In the normal rescue service, they are not actually involved, since they serve for self-protection or to assist the staff on the fire engine. The crew has, in contrast to the other ambulance crews, a medical and firefighting training. If no ambulance of the regular rescue service is available, they are alerted to peak coverage. The same applies to the ambulances of the works fire service BMW, Krauss-Maffei, MTU / MAN and TU Munich in Garching. == Specialties  Height Rescue === Demonstration of the height rescue group 2017 Since May 1996 the Munich professional fire department maintains a height rescue group at the fire station in Föhring, from which five personnel are constantly on duty. They are part of the normal fire service and attend to conventional firefighting operations. About 110 times a year, however, they must also be alerted, since conventional life- saving equipment such as turntables, fall protection or the like is no longer sufficient. They also working closely with several air rescue services, which also help with rescue helicopters if necessary. A Germany-wide unique cooperation exists between the hospital Bogenhausen and the height rescuers, since about 50 emergency physicians of this hospital were trained in height rescue. This also makes it possible to provide patients in exposed locations with emergency medical care and only then to rescue them through technical measures. === Water rescue / ice rescue === Due to civil service regulations, all professional firefighters in Germany have completed training as a lifeguard (at the minimum the German rescue swimming badge in bronze). In addition, located at the fire stations 5 and 6, are a group of divers who disengage with their water rescue equipment vehicle in addition to the appropriate guards. Also, at the fire station 6, the training for fire fighter divers and fire service diving instructor takes place. In order to save time, two divers of the fire station 5 are picked up by a rescue helicopter and flown directly to the place of the incident. In order to be able to provide effective assistance even before the arrival of the divers group, all other fire stations and fire station houses are also equipped with water rescue equipment. Also, for ice rescue, the corresponding units move out regularly. === Pressure chamber === In order to be able to treat diver accidents, there is also a stationary pressure chamber (center for hyperbaric medicine) at the fire station 5, which is also suitable for the treatment of smoke poisoning and other intoxications. The pressure chamber is one of the few in Germany, which is on 24 hours standby and the appropriate medical professionals, for example diving physician, is available immediately. As a result, and through the corresponding technical equipment, intensive care of the patient is possible in the pressure chamber. === Analytical Task Force (ATF) === Since 2010 in Munich, there is also a joint Analytical Task Force made up from the volunteer and professional fire departments. === Air Operations Unit === The air operations unit has been in operation since 2008, and carries out forest firefighting from the air and transports equipment and personnel to hardly accessible areas in cooperation with helicopters of other organizations such as military, federal and state police. The Air Operations Unit also sets up and operates outdoor landing sites (weather forecasting, flight information / guidance). For forest fire fighting, the unit has two 900 l and two 5000 l containers (see Dept. Waldperlach), as well as various additional material (e.g. 7000 l folding containers, forest fire fighting equipment). === Integrated dispatch and control center === Munich operates the Bavaria wide oldest integrated dispatch and control center, which coordinates approximately 1,400 daily operations of the fire department, rescue service, THW and civil protection in Munich (emergency services of the districts also) and dispatches 540 vehicles. For this purpose, the dispatchers can fall back on a firefighting and rescue service training, as well as several years of operational experience. The Integrated Dispatch and Control Center includes management rooms to enable the Civil Protection Operations Staff to coordinate large-scale operations. It also serves nationwide as a counseling center in dealing with hazardous substances and provides further help, if necessary, such as TUIS, ATF. It is also responsible throughout Bavaria for the coordination of intensive care transport helicopters, as well as the distribution and availability of beds for severely burned casualties. The control center receives an emergency call on average every 30 seconds. In order to cope with the number of calls, the Integrated Control Center has 24 ISDN channels for the European emergency call 112 and 16 ISDN channels for the number 19222. These can be queried from 21 places at the same time, whereby in large operations and storms eight additional telephone workstations can be switched on. As a backup, since October 2005, an \\"emergency ILST\\" was implemented and is housed in the FW 1. In order to enable the deaf to request help, it is also possible to send an emergency fax. The processing of the mission data is therefore done with computer assistance. Over nine radio channels of the 4-meter band and 16 2-meter bands, as well as digital radio, not only units can be alerted but they can also communicate with them, a radio network in the subway and S-Bahn also exists, as well as in special buildings (e.g. high-rise buildings so-called building wireless) therefore a connection with the emergency services is also possible. In 2017, the Integrated Control Center moved from its previous location, the FW3, to the newly built FW4 in Schwabing. == Disaster control == Disaster Management Center of the Munich Fire Department (ELW 3) The Munich disaster control is made up from the professional fire department, the volunteer fire department, the worker Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Deutschland (Samariter federation), the Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz (Bavarian red cross), the Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe, the Malteser Hilfsdienst e.V. (Malteser relief service), the DLRG (German life rescue society), the Technisches Hilfswerk (Federal institute for technical assistance organization) and the air rescue services. Volunteer members from these organizations that are involved in disaster protection were exempted from military service. Effective action by these units is particularly dependent on a well-organized governance structure. Therefore, damage areas are divided into operational sections, which are led and coordinated by the local operations manager. In the event of a mass-casualty incident, additional assistance from a senior emergency physician and the organizational director (so-called sanitary mission management SanEL) is provided. The Integrated Control Center is responsible for passing on information and instructions to the individual operational units. The central vehicle hall for the Munich disaster control is the Zeppelinhalle in the district Sendling. Also located there are large-scale warehouses for aid organizations. == Civil Protection == The civil protection targets particularly at civilian protection in the case of required defense. The organization works parallel to the disaster control. In addition, however, the Munich Fire Department is also particularly active in the area of provisioning. For this purpose, it maintains thirty protection facilities, which also include large protection rooms, basic shelters and bunkers. In addition, the fire department school in Munich regularly offers instruction seminars for companies and citizens. A special area of activity for the civilian protection is the drinking water supply. This is guaranteed by a system of shallow and deep wells throughout the city, whose connections are camouflaged for safety reasons. == Municipal Fire Department Association Munich == The Municipal Fire Department Association München e.V., founded on 20 September 1993, unites all Munich fire departments into an interest group. The board consists of the head of the professional fire department (1st chairman), the acting commander of the volunteer fire department (1st vice chairman) and another person to be elected (2nd vice chairman). If necessary, the individual members of the Municipal Fire Department Association can support one another in missions and carry out joint exercises. The Municipal Fire Department Association organizes a symposium every year, during which experts talk about current topics related to fire protection and technical assistance. == See also == \\"Die Geschichte der Münchner Berufsfeuerwehr\\" (The history of the Munich fire department) on muenchen.de == References  External links == * Stadtfeuerwehrverband * Branddirektion München * Freiwillige Feuerwehr München Category:1866 establishments in Bavaria Category:Fire departments of Germany Category:Government of Munich Category:Government agencies established in 1866 ","title":"Munich Fire Department"},{"id":"56783600","text":"Lahlou is a surname.

She is known for auctioning off her Arran land to pay for central heating in her island cottage. ==Early life== Castle Buchanan in late 1890s She was the daughter of The 6th Duke of Montrose and his wife, Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. She was born in Edinburgh and spent much of her childhood at Castle Buchanan on Loch Lomond. In the summer she would spend a lot of time with the royalty of Monaco, including Prince Rainier III of Monaco, husband of Grace Kelly and Princess Antoinette. She described the times they spent together as being great fun, and they spent their days playing and eating cookies. Lady Jean Fforde enjoyed balls and parties, and she came out as a debutante in 1939 where she was presented to King George VI. ==Career== Her father, who was The 6th Duke of Montrose, spoke to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten (who later became The 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma), which led to her getting a job as a \\"temporary assistant\\" at the government code and cypher school called Bletchley Park. Whilst working here she joined more than 8000 women in their mission to break German codes to help end the war. Thanks to her and all the other workers, this resulted in ending the war two years early. Fforde also authored a memoir called Feet on the Ground: From Castle to Catastrophe.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Feet-Ground-Lady- Jean-Fforde/dp/0948474165 In this book she wrote about her personal experiences, travels and adventures. She also described her experience at Bletchley Park as a \\"rather dull chapter in an otherwise colourful life\\" and she goes on to say that \\"it was excessively boring. It was not as glamorous as subsequent books and films have made it appear\\". Fforde described Alan Turing, the mathematical genius who worked at Bletchley Park, as a “very nice man, who should have had public recognition. He was a lovely man, an accessible man. Sweet, handsome, shabby, nail-bitten, sometimes halting in speech and awkward in manner\\". Fforde worked under Alan Turing in Hut 8 of Bletchley Park. She described her time there as \\"dull\\" and that the men working there were less pleasant, and the food inedible. ==Personal life== In 1947, the then Lady Jean Graham married Colonel John Fforde, who she later divorced in 1957. They had a son together called Charles Fforde. They spent a lot of time travelling, and they lived in Palestine, Sierra Leone and Northern Rhodesia. ==AncestryReferences== Category:1920 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Daughters of British dukes Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Ayrshire and Arran Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Bletchley Park women ","title":"Lady Jean Fforde"},{"id":"56783673","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

It stars Anthony LaPaglia and Mimi Rogers, alongside a supporting cast featuring Matt Craven, Peter Boyle, Monika Schnarre, Joseph Maher, and Mark Acheson. The film first premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and Houston International Festival in 1994, and was later released to the United States and the United Kingdom in 1995. The story concerns a professional assassin Anthony LaPaglia who is pressured into accepting a new assignment as a favour to his boss Peter Boyle. He later finds himself in a dismal situation with dire consequences for everyone involved. == Cast Plot== The events of the film take place over the course of one night. The storyline follows Mick (Anthony LaPaglia), a cold-blooded, disinterested, existential hitman who is assigned the task of killing a woman that has stiffed Mick's boss George (Peter Boyle) $650,000. At first Mick is reluctant in accepting the job, but is later assured by George that the job will be easy, as the woman has accepted her fate. After accepting the job, Mick's friend Archie (Matt Craven) begs to accompany him. Mick hesitates because Archie previously made a mistake in the last job and nearly cost George and Mick their lives. After much discussion, Mick accepts Archie's company. When Mick arrives at the woman's house, he finds Fiona (Mimi Rogers) is expecting him. She ushers her guests from the party she is hosting, and invites Mick inside. Fiona's cool demeanour both surprises and impresses Mick. She soon has Mick tied to her bed, where the two engage in sadistic intercourse. Mick finds the pain Fiona inflicts on him arousing, and her ability to pleasure him is incomparable to other women Mick has slept with. As the two are dressing, Fiona dismisses Mick's performance, and they head downstairs to where Archie is waiting for them.Article on TVGuide The more time they spend together, the less Mick is willing to kill Fiona. Feeling conflicted, Mick calls George demanding the severity of Fiona's crime and questioning the need for the hit. Ending his phone call with George, he returns to the car determined to finish the job, but with no rush. Fiona suggests the three grab Chinese food, and head to the cemetery for a picnic. There, Fiona experiences a psychotic episode, and falls into a schizophrenic state.Article on TVGuide Mick rushes Fiona to a psychiatrist (Joseph Maher), who informs Mick that Fiona has an incurable mental illness that will most certainly soon destroy her. Torn, Mick takes Fiona to the shipping docks to finish the job, but finds he cannot bring himself to carry through. When George arrives, he and Mick begin to argue once more over the need to complete the job. As the two are arguing, Fiona convinces Archie to kill her. Mick is left devastated.Beck, Henry (1995). \\"Reel to Reel -- Bulletproof Heart Directed by Mark Malone.\\" The Village Voice Apr 11 1995: 64.

She was daughter of Edward Arthur Gerrish (28 April 1878 – 7 November 1960), a servant, who later married the daughter of the house, Alison Kellie-McCallum (29 September 1887 – 23 May 1975). She grew up attending eight different schools as her parents moved for her father to find work. Alison finished her school education in 1938 and qualified as a riding instructor, as a member of the Royal Horse Society. ==Bletchley Park== As one of the WRNS, Robins was one of the last surviving members of the 'Y-Service' at Bletchley Park, who listened-in to German communications.\\"A Wren's Story - Memories of 1939-1945\\", by Alison Robins. bletchleypark.org.uk. Retrieved 5 June 2019. During the Second World War, Robins was said to have been bored as an officers' steward waiting at table in the Painted Hall of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, so she joined a class to learn Morse code in her off-duty time. She quickly reached the speed needed to join the Signal School and in January 1941 passed the course and was made a Chief Petty Officer. Her first posting was to the R.N. Wireless Station at Scarborough. By May 1942 she was transferred to Felixstowe - a very busy station with E-Boats working continuously up and down the coast trying to destroy British convoys carrying vital supplies. All the Morse came in code that was passed to \\"Station X\\" to be decoded - a place so secret that few knew where or what it was. It was only in the late 1990s Alison discovered it was called Bletchley Park. In 1943, she moved to Sheringham in Norfolk where she decided to learn German so she could listen to speech as well as Morse from the U-Boats. Various German speaking Wrens helped her learn by singing simple songs and she also bought a Hugo 'Teach Yourself German in 3 Months' book. Every day, German High Command gave out a report on the progress of the war and it was always at dictation speed so she learned to write it down accurately. She soon became proficient and was one of the few Wrens who could listen in both Morse and German. In 1943, she was transferred under the Commander-in-Chief, Dover - another very busy station with all the traffic passing through the English Channel and the build-up to the Allied invasion of Europe.

Huron Street in Pontiac, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. ==History== Frederick C. Myrick moved to Pontiac some time after 1851, and the house was likely built for him in the 1850s. Myrick died in 1860, and his widow sold the house to Charles Palmer in 1862. Palmer was born in 1814 in New York state, graduated from Union College in 1837, and served as principal for various schools in the east. He moved to Michigan in 1847, working in Romeo and Flint as well as serving as a Regent of the University of Michigan. Palmer was also involved in mining, and promoted many interests in the Upper Peninsula before and after he moved to Pontiac. Palmer retired in 1875, and lived in this house until his death in 1887. ==Description== The Palmer House is a timber-framed, Italian Villa style two- story house on a fieldstone foundation. It is roughly cubical, with an L-shaped rear service wing. The walls are clad with flush siding, a fairly unusual feature in Michigan architecture. The house has a hip roof supported with paired brackets. Small decorative balconies are around many of the windows. A large flat-roofed cupola in the center of the roof was destroyed in a 1930 fire, and later rebuilt. On the interior, a center entrance hall runs through the building, opening onto a parlor and two smaller rooms. Three bedrooms are on the second floor. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland County, Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1855 ","title":"Myrick-Palmer House"},{"id":"56783849","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

He obtained a seat in the House in 2004 after a fellow DPJ member from the same proportional representation block resigned his PR block seat to run in the Saitama 8th district by-election. Honda remained a member until 2005, when he was defeated by Toshio Kojima in the Saitama-12th race.

He was nicknamed 'il diseredato' (the disinherited). ==Biography == The eldest son of Pier Maria II de' Rossi and Antonia Torelli, he was born in San Secondo and was so different to his father (especially in politics) that he ended up disinheriting him in his 1464 will in favour of his legitimate sons Guido and Bernardo and his illegitimate son Ottaviano (Arluno). Giovanni was thus exiled with nothing and entered the service of the king of France, though he continued to claim the inheritance which had been denied him. When Pier Maria II died on 1 September 1482 in the midst of the Rossi War against Sforza troops under Ludovico il Moro and Pier Maria II's own son Guido, the succession became even more tangled. He attempted a last-ditch defence of the castle at San Secondo in 1483 before fleeing to Venice, where he died in exile in 1490. Giovanni refused to back either side during the war, as did his brother Bertrando. However, thanks to good relations with Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, Trivulzio returned the fiefdom of San Secondo to Giovanni, by then an old man Pellegri Marco, Il castello e la terra di San Secondo nella storia dell'arte, Patrocinio amministrazione comunale San Secondo, 1979. Between 1497 and 1499 Giovanni and Gian Giacomo served under Louis XII of France and after Ludovico il Moro's fall the French king officially reinstated Giovanni in all his fiefdoms in 1499. He died at San Secondo in 1502 and was succeeded as count by his son Troilo I. The conflict provoked by Pier Maria II's will was finally fully resolved by the Battle of San Secondo in 1522. == Marriage and issue == Giovanni married Angela Scotti Douglas, daughter of Francesco Scotti Douglas, count of Carpaneto and Vigoleno. They had four children: * Troilo I de' Rossi * Ettore de' Rossi * Alessandro de' Rossi * Pentesilea de' Rossi ==Notes References Sources== * Pellegri Marco, Il castello e la terra di San Secondo nella storia dell'arte, 1979 * Giuseppe Maria Cavalli, Cenni storici della Borgata di San Secondo, 1870 * Le signorie dei Rossi di Parma, am L.

She also became the first female president of the Irish Paediatric Association, the paediatric section of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI) Post- graduate Association, and the Irish American Pediatric Association. Coffey was also the first female recipient of the RCSI Distinguished Graduate medal. ==Early life and family== Pearse Street, Dublin (formerly Great Brunswick Street) Victoria Philomela Dorothy Coffeyhttps://www.geni.com/people/Victoria- Coffey-Dr/6000000020662222581 Retrieved=2018-10-27 was born on 16 September 1911 at 108 Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street) in Dublin, Ireland. She was the daughter of John Coffey, a weigh-master, cattle exporter and bookmaker and Ellie Coffey, who ran The Royal Arms in Kilcullen. Her paternal grandfather William Coffey had been Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1909 to 1910. During her childhood, Victoria—known to friends as \\"Viki\\"— won numerous medals for her musical performances. She played the piano and cello, and trained as a singer under instruction from Vincent O'Brien. Coffey had 10 siblings. Her younger sister Pauline also became a doctor and won prestigious awards in the Royal College of Surgeons. Five of Coffey's siblings died as children—four in infancy. According to Coffey's grand-nephew Robert Coffey, \\"that was one of the main reasons she was so motivated to learn about the health of newborns and young children\\". He described her as \\"a no nonsense person but with quite a wicked sense of humour\\". She helped raise for the Dominican mission (now the Dublin Christian Mission), with which her brother Cecil was associated. She survived poliomyelitis in 1955. ==Education and career== Trinity College Dublin, Ireland Coffey was known for her diligence and hard work. At the age of 25, she qualified for the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), where she graduated with a licentiate degree and a degree in midwifery from the conjoint board of the RCSI. Seven years later, in 1943, she earned a DPH diploma in Children's Health at the RCSI. She developed strong qualities of leadership, responsibility, and pugnacious personality by working with men such as Tom Lane, Henry Stokes and Oliver St. John Gogarty at Meath Hospital, the cradle of the Dublin School of Medicine, where she was a student and house officer. In the same year, she served as a clinical clerk at Coombe Hospital for Women. Shortly afterwards, she was appointed as a medical officer in St Kevin's Hospital due to her knowledge of obstetrics. At St. Kevin's Hospital, Coffey became interested in the neglected field of congenital birth defects and began a publishing career. She was motivated to learn about the health of babies and young children, and focused on paediatrics. Coffey's first paper, which she wrote in 1953, is about syphilis in children. Her research mainly focused on children born with congenital and metabolic diseases, and was completed with the help of the Medical Research Council, Trinity College Dublin and Professor Jessop of Meath Hospital. She then began to research sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and was one of the first women to study it. Her numerous publications covered most aspects of congenital disorders. In 1954, Coffey gave a paper on this topic at the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland. Coffey published her findings in the Irish Journal of Medical Science between 1955 and 1959. In recognition of her work in paediatrics, she was appointed lecturer in teratology at Trinity College Dublin in 1961, earning a Ph.D. from the University of Dublin in 1965 for a thesis on the incidence and aetiology of congenital defects in Ireland. She published internationally and maintained her research output for several years after her retirement. Coffey founded the Faculty of Paediatrics at the RCPI in 1981 and was the first female president of the Irish Paediatric Society. ==Later life and legacy== RCSI Building Coffey lived in Rathmines, a suburb of Dublin, with her parents before their deaths, and remained there until her own death. She died at 87 on 25 June 1999 in St. James's Hospital, where she had worked most of her life. She is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin; according to Lynn Brady, Coffey's grave is at the LF103 Garden Section of the cemetery. On International Women's Day in 2018, Coffey was honoured for her outstanding contribution to medicine and was chosen to be part of \\"Women on Walls\\", an arts project hosted by RCSI in partnership with Accenture, with her portrait displayed in the RCSI's principal boardroom. == References == Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Category:Irish surgeons Category:Irish women medical doctors Category:1911 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Irish pediatricians Category:Irish medical researchers Category:Irish scholars and academics Category:20th-century surgeons ","title":"Victoria Coffey"},{"id":"56783986","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

Her art specialized in miniature painting, illustrations, and needlework. She lectured on Persian rugs, wrote articles of various topics under a masculine pseudonym, and even composed a march. ==Early years and education== Louise Hammond Willis was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1870. From her mother, Elizabeth Louise Hammond, she inherited a love of nature and a scientific mind. From her father, Major Edward Willis, she inherited ambition, an indomitable will and perseverance. The Willis home was the meeting place of men and women of talent and distinction. She was graduated with first-honor medal and diploma from the Charleston Female Seminary. Her art studies were carried on in Charleston, under E. Whittock McDowell, and in New York City under James Carroll Beckwith and Harry Siddons Mowbray. She studied drawing, painting and modeling under William Merritt Chase, Frank DuMond, Irving Ramsey Wiles, and others at Art Students League of New York, New York School of Art and in European galleries, as well as being a pupil of Theodora Thayer and Alice Beckington. Snead also completed a post-graduate course in literature and languages. ==Career== While still a student, Snead had charge of the painting and drawing classes at Charleston Female Seminary. She was the assistant teacher in the Carolina Art School. Believing that everything helps everything else, she applied herself to the study of architecture, and in so doing, developed plans. While her specialty was portraiture, her illustrations and pen-and-ink drawings were meritorious, while she also excelled in the art of fine and artistic needle work, point-laces and art embroideries. \\"Emma C Rose\\" a 1907 artwork by Louise Hammond Willis Snead Snead exhibited for years in the New York Watercolor Society and at the American Society of Miniature Painters. She designed houseboats and model modern suburban homes for ten years. She received Honorable mention at the South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition, 1902. Snead lectured on “The Magic Carpet,\\" or the making of real Persian rugs. Other lectures were on topics of special interest to women's clubs, one being point laces. She illustrated a series of articles on the subject of point-lace making for Chautauqua Magazine. Snead copied many antique embroideries from museums, in the line of art needlework. She was interested in handicrafts, weaving, hammered brass, illuminated leather, tapestry and in all lines of interior decoration. Snead was familiar with a half-dozen languages. She wrote both prose and poetry for magazines, her writings appeared over the pen name \\"Louis Hammond Willis.\\" Snead contributed largely to women's magazines for fifteen years, and illustrated her own articles. She also played on a number of musical instruments. Having studied the theory of music, her compositions demonstrated originality. Snead composed approximately 20 songs and a march that was orchestrated by Victor Herbert and played by Patrick Gilmore's Band. ==Personal life== Snead made her home at 1 Wilson Avenue, Murray Hill, Flushing, Long Island, New York. She was a member of Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters. By religion, she was Protestant. Her recreations included landscape gardening, building stone pillars and walls, and making concrete garden furniture. She married Harry Vairln Snead of New York City, son of Col. Thomas L.

It was completed and first performed in Zurich in 1966, and published by Schott. == Composition == Henze's Double Concerto was commissioned by Paul Sacher and his Collegium Musicum Zürich and is dedicated to him and his wife, Maya Sacher, like Henze's Sonata per archi. It was written for oboist Heinz Holliger and his wife, harpist Ursula Holliger. It was finished in 1966 and was premiered on 2 December 1966 by the Holligers as the soloists and Sacher conducting his Collegium Musicum Zürich. It was eventually published by Schott Music. == Structure == The concerto is in one movement which has a total duration of approximately thirty minutes. It is divided in a ternary ABA1 structure, with an additional coda based in B, which recalls the structure of Bartók's third quartet. In recordings, the tracks are usually divided according to this structure: * Section A starts at bar 1, marked ♩ = c. 112, with the oboe presenting the theme to be further developed in the section. * Section B starts at bar 252, marked Andante, with a slower and darker tone, and ends with a cadenza performed by the harp. * Section A1 starts at bar 386, after the cadenza is finished, and the main theme is quoted several times during this section. It is marked ♩ = 80 and features a short cadenza by the oboe. * The coda starts at bar 558, marked Andante, and is the shortest section in the concerto. The tone is, again, dark and rhythmically simpler. Since this is a concertante piece, it features many technical challenges, such as double harmonics, flutter-tonguings, microtone glissandi and the so-called circular breathing, a technique which was fairly recent at the time. For Henze, it is important to have a decorative contrast in instrumentation such as the harp, since \\"the distinctive oboe timbre can exhaust the listener if overdone\\". The concerto is scored for the two soloists, oboe and harp, and a string section consisting of 18 soloists, eight violins, four violas, four cellos and two double basses. == Recordings == * Both the commissioners and the original soloists recorded the piece in July 1968. The recording was released by Deutsche Grammophon. * Hans Werner Henze conducted the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and recorded the piece with soloists Heinz and Ursula Holliger in October 27, 1968. == References  External links == * Double Concerto (Doppio concerto) Hans Werner Henze Stiftung Category:Compositions by Hans Werner Henze Category:1966 compositions Category:Concertos for multiple instruments ","title":"Double Concerto (Henze)"},{"id":"56784085","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

The Oscan praenomen Salvius occurs in a filiation, suggesting that at least some of the Romanii were of Oscan descent. ==Branches and cognomina== In imperial times, the Romanii used a number of surnames, but all appear to have been personal cognomina, and the Romanii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families. ==Members== * Romania, buried at an uncertain location in Cisalpine Gaul, with a monument dedicated by a certain Prisca.Camporini, Sculture a tutto tondo del Civico Museo Archeologico di Milano, 40b. * Romania, the wife of Titus Fabius Pulcher, with whom she made an offering to Isis at Aquileia in Venetia and Histria.. * Romania, the wife of Lucius Julius Caper, one of the seviri Augustales at Nemausus in Gallia Narbonensis.. * Romania, the daughter of Salonia, buried in a family sepulchre at Salona in Dalmatia, together with Romania Italia and Romanius, the son of Surio.. * Romania, the daughter of Prosostus, and granddaughter of Gaius Valerius Fuscus, a veteran of the second legion, with whom she was buried at Brigetio in Pannonia Superior, in the first half of the second century, aged twenty.. * Romanius, the house slave of Quintus Cornelius Graptus and his wife, Sabina, with whom he was buried at Rome.. * Romanius M. f., a priest named in a funerary inscription from Bantia in Lucania.. * Romanius, the son of Surio, buried in a family sepulchre at Salona, together with Romania Italia, and Romania, the daughter of Salonia. * Gaius Romanius C. f., a native of Berytus, an officer serving in the century of Hordeonius at Mons Claudianus in Egypt.. * Gaius Romanius P. f., twice military tribune, named in an inscription from Rome, together with Publius Romanius.. * Numerius Romanius Sal. f., named in an inscription from Supinum Vicus in Samnium.. * Publius Romanius M. f., buried at Brixia in Venetia and Histria, together with his sister, Romania Tertia.. * Publius Romanius C. f., named in an inscription from Rome, together with Gaius Romanius, a military tribune. * Quintus Romanius, the son of Camburo, made an offering to Minerva at Brixia.InscrIt, x. 5, 63. * Titus Romanius, buried at Sextantio in Gallia Narbonensis.ILGN, 554. * Lucius Romanius N. l.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Gubnagree is bounded on the north by Corraclassy townland, on the west by Corracholia Beg and Tullandreen townlands, on the south by Derryvella (Corlough) townland and on the east by Corranierna (Corlough) and Derrynaslieve townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), forestry plantations and small streams. Gubnagree is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 125 statute acres. ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as Gubnagree. In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, \\"Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate\\".

She was the daughter of Pieter Hendrik Pott (1858-1905), merchant and shopkeeper, and Lamberta Gerrechiena Heikens (1860-1946). She studied at the Minerva Academy in Groningen and then at the Hague Drawing Academy. In 1912 she graduated as a drawing teacher and returned to Groningen. In 1914 she started working as a drawing teacher at the Kweekschool for teachers. She stayed with this school until 1930. In 1922 she married Gijsbert George Martens. She died of a lung disease in 1931. == De Ploeg == Alida Pott was one of the first members of the artist collective De Ploeg. For the competition to design 'a simple drawing symbol' for the new association, she came up with the winning design. From 1919 a stylized P forms the logo of 'De Ploeg'. She held various board positions and was secretary from 1919 to 1921. Until 1922, she was one of the permanent representatives at the De Ploeg exhibitions in the Pictura halls or at Kunsthandel Ongering. The exhibition of the autumn of 1925 was the last one she participated in. == Artistic style == Alida Pott worked in different styles, varying from precisely elaborated and traditional realism to a flat- decorative style, in which the effects of various movements of the avant-garde were visible. Pott lived in different worlds. She was so Gronings as Blauwborgje, but she also incorporated Japanese art and allowed modern tendencies in her work, even before the other Ploegers had discovered expressionism or constructivism \\" (Timmer, 2004, 52). She mastered virtually all techniques, but her watercolors show the most pronounced 'Pott handwriting'. A special part of her work is formed by collages. Timmer (2004, 60-62) regards this as' a position in relation to the expressionistic wind that blew through 'De Ploeg'. Presumably she was inspired by the Dadaist collages by Kurt Schwitters. Like many Ploegschilders, Pott was also active in the field of design and applied art. She painted wooden pins with constructivist motifs and drew designs for wall and tablecloths. Alida Pott took a special place in 'De Ploeg'. Her work can not simply be accommodated in typical Plow expressionism or constructivism. There was, however, an exchange of ideas with her husband Georg Martens, although it is not possible to speak of a strong artistic relationship. Before that, their characters broke too much apart. With Jan Gerrit Jordens (Alida Pott was friends with his wife Jet Jordens-Luchsinger) she shared the fascination with trees. Both were interested in the linear structure of trunk and branches. (Timmer, 2004, 64) == After 1931 == After her death, the work of Alida Pott was kept by Georg Martens. It was only rarely seen in public in the decades that followed. In 1981 there was a large retrospective exhibition in the Fraeylemaborg in Slochteren. == Works == In the collection of the Groninger Museum are her Girl with Long Red Hair and Green Bow, Orchard Blauwborgje and the design made together with her husband for a Jurievrij exhibition of de Ploeg. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1931 deaths Category:20th- century Dutch painters Category:Dutch women painters Category:People from Groningen (city) Category:Deaths from lung disease Category:Royal Academy of Art, The Hague alumni Category:20th-century women artists ","title":"Alida Jantina Pott"},{"id":"56784155","text":"The Airport Express line () of the Hangzhou Metro, also known as the Central Express line () or Line 31, Line K1, is an under construction rapid transit line in Hangzhou.

His mother was Pier Maria II's wife Antonia Torelli. Little is known of his youth: he served in the duke of Milan's army and in 1478 was made governor of Pontremoli and Lunigiana. He is known to have been a condottiero and man-at-arms in 1479. Pompeo (1781-1851) Litta, Famiglie celebri di Italia. Rossi di Parma / P. Litta In his will in 1464 Pier Maria II made Guido, his brother Bertrando and one of his illegitimate sons his heirs. This disinherited Pier Maria II's eldest son Giovanni. The Rocca dei Rossi in San Secondo. Guido came to his father's aid during the Rossi War against Ludovico il Moro and was thus declared a rebel by the duchy of Milan. He successfully held the Rocca dei Rossi in San Secondo against a Sforza siege under Antonio del Vasto (son of the marquess of Saluzzo), who was killed during the siege. Guido put a price on Sforza's head but the situation soon worsened. He was promised Venetian reinforcements but these were tied down in the War of Ferrara and could not reach him. Pier Maria II moved from San Secondo to Torrechiara, dying in the latter location on 1 September 1482. Some castles were betrayed, such as those at Carona, Bosco di Corniglio and Roccaferrara. San Secondo was still under siege - Guido attempted a night sortie on 12 September, but this failed. The war against the Rossi was using up precious resources that were needed for the War of Ferrara and so il Moro could not afford to prolong the siege. Guido's father-in-law Filippo Borromeo pushed him to accept a very unfavourable peace settlement. Guido personally went into the enemy camp, where he was offered an end to the siege and to hostilities as a whole in return for swearing fealty to the Duchy of Milan, disarming and giving up several territories and his castles. He accepted and in the end even gave up several annexations and territories and his castles on the border with Parma as well as handing over his son Filippo Maria as a hostage. The Venetians stoked the brothers' feud, however, and the Sforza family soon found a pretext to renew it in the form of Torelli family's alliance and a Venetian provveditore's reception at the castle at Torrechiara. They declared Guido a public enemy on 18 January 1483 and Sforza Secondo Sforza count of Borgonovo attacked him, forcing him to retreat into Piacentine territory. After skirmishes in the Nure valley, Guido moved into the territory of the Republic of Genoa, losing the 33 castles remaining to him after the 1482 peace settlement - even the castle at San Secondo surrendered on 21 June that year. The sala delle Gesta Rossiane in the Rocca di Rossi, with paintings showing Guido's conduct at Calliano. The Peace of Bagnolo ended the War of Ferrara on 7 August 1484 but instead of returning the Rossi family lands to the Rossi the treaty handed them directly to il Moro to distribute among his favourites. Guido thus moved to Venice, where he was given an annual allowance as a condottiero and a company of 200 men-at-arms and 300 mounted archers. He led this force in the war between Venice and the county of Tyrol, provoked by Sigismund of Austria over tax issues. At the decisive battle of Calliano on 1 August 1487, when the Venetian commander-in-chief Roberto Sanseverino was killed and surrender seemed inevitable, Guido took over command and made a surprise attack on the German troops with 300 mounted archers, including his son Filippo Maria. This forced the Tyroleans to retreat to Trento with heavy losses.

This environment may be closed or open. Closed systems (e.g., gears in a gearbox) are theoretically not affected by weather conditions. On the other hand, open systems are affected by weather conditions (i.e., precipitation, temperature, and humidity). For example, weather conditions will strongly influence the tribosystem formed in a ski-trail contact, and ski preparation specialists need to do a thorough work before a ski race. Another example is that of tire–road and wheel-rail contacts that are exposed to the external environment. Here, artificial and natural contaminants will exert an influence on friction and wear. Sound and airborne particles from the contacting surfaces are not contained and emit to the surrounding air. Tribology at the wheel-rail contact plays a key role in railway performance. Friction controls the tracking and braking, while wear affects reliability and endurance. Temperature influences the tribological process by affecting the properties of the contacting surfaces. Polymers, for example, are harder at low temperatures than at room temperature.

Sforza Secondo Sforza (1433 - 1492/1493) was an Italian condottiero. ==Life== Born in Grottammare, he was the illegitimate son of Francesco Sforza by his lover Giovanna d'Acquapendente. In 1451 he married Antonia Dal Verme (?–1487) and to mark the occasion Sforza's father granted him the county of Borgonovo. He and Tiberto Brandolini tried to come to the assistance of Giovanni d'Angiò in his battle against the kingdom of Aragon, but in 1461 Sforza was captured and was only freed thanks to his wife's petition. He only had one legitimate child by her, Giovanna, who died in 1453. He was reinstated in his lands by Ludovico il Moro, who put him in charge of the war against the Republic of Genoa, which had rebelled against the Adorno family. However, Sforza was defeated and in 1482 he was sent to invade the territories of the county of San Secondo and besiege the Rocca dei Rossi during the Rossi War, forcing Pier Maria II de' Rossi to flee to his castle at Torrechiara. In 1483 he was promoted to captain general and fought against Parma, which had attempted to rebel against the Sforzas, and the following year he was made governor of Piacenza. When il Moro fell, Sforza Secondo fled to Naples, where he probably died between 1492 and 1493. ==Illegitimate issue== * Jacopetto, later legitimated * Lucrezia, married Antonio Anguissola * Francesco (?–1491), later legitimated, married Franceschina Borromeo * Polissena * Leone, later legitimated ==References== category:Condottieri category:1492 deaths category:1493 deaths category:Illegitimate children of Italian monarchs Sforza Secondo category:Counts of Italy ","title":"Sforza Secondo Sforza"},{"id":"56784230","text":"Multi-seat valve with pneumatic actuator Multi-seat valves, or multi-port valves, are used to shut off or control complex liquid flows in sterile areas in the beverage and food industry as well as in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Multi-seat valves often replace combinations of several single-seated valves in aseptic processing. == Use and function == Especially in the production of pharmaceutical active substances, but also for numerous aseptic processes, installations with a high degree of individualization are required as the high variant diversity can hardly be covered by standard components. As a result, valve manufacturers demand high expertise in the field of construction as well as close interaction between planner and manufacturer at the planning stage of (aseptic) installations to ensure e.g. the draining capability of the installation along with utmost compactness. That arises from the product-related high diversity of biotechnological processes and from particularities in the processing and consolidation of ingredients for these highly sensitive products. Similar to single-seated valves, multi-seat valves consist of the valve body, however, are equipped with various diaphragms and actuators, as well as one control and feedback unit per actuator. With the exclusive use of gate valves, i.e. diaphragm valves that block the flow in a pipeline using a single diaphragm, the variation options would be limited to different nominal connection sizes. Adding and combining T- or Y- shaped single-seated valves allows quite complicated process flows and distributions. Nonetheless, multi-seat valves contain specific advantages for aseptic processes, leading to a virtually endless flexibility in system design. Since multi-seat valves are mostly made from a forged block, which enables an extremely compact design, they are sometimes referred to as block valves. The compactness of a multifunctional multi-seat valve and hence the installation can be strongly influenced by the size of available actuators. Significant advantages can be achieved by using actuators whose diameters is not larger than the diaphragms' diameters. Distinguished manufacturers of multi-seat valves are GEMÜ, Bürkert, Saunders and SISTO. File:SISTO-C Kombination.jpgValve combination (scheme) File:GEH-C Ventilring.jpgCircular construction (scheme) File:SISTO-CM601.jpgMulti-seat valve (scheme) == Cleanability == Due to the compact layout of the multi-seat valve, its dimensions are smaller, hence the (sub-) system requires less space. Furthermore, the surface in contact with medium inside the valve can be significantly reduced compared to the circular construction, which is advantageous in terms of cleaning and draining capability. Furthermore, multi- seat valves contain fewer areas of bad rinsing or accumulation of the product. In terms of rinsing out valve combinations, the \\"3D-rule\\" must be taken in account. According to this rule, the length of a branch up to the valve seat should not exceed three times the diameter of the branch. Using a multi-seated construction, \\"dead branches\\" can be avoided, so microbial contaminants in the stagnant medium are reduced considerably. If the valve is installed correctly at the defined inclined position and the inner metal surface is of high quality, modern inner geometry allows a complete self-draining of the diaphragm valve. == Actuator types == Pneumatic piston actuator (scheme) On account of the mostly complex constructions of multi-seat valves, pneumatic actuators are used in most cases. Pneumatic actuators can be differentiated as piston and diaphragm actuators depending on the design. Advantages on the piston actuator are in a compact design that is especially suitable for multi- seat constructions. Lightweight multi-seat valves with less \\"dead spaces\\" can thus be designed. Since the piston actuator has a smooth surface without areas difficult to clean, the outside is easier to clean compared to the diaphragm actuator. Advantage on the diaphragm actuator, however, is a more cost- effective assembly. == See also == Valve Diaphragm valve == References == Category:Valves ","title":"Multi-seat valve"},{"id":"56784234","text":"Federico \\"Fritzy\\" Giovanelli (1932 – January 19, 2018) was a New York mobster and a caporegime in the Genovese crime family. ==Career== Giovanelli began as a small time criminal who had participated in loansharking, bookmaking, and illegal gambling. After becoming a capo in the Genovese crime family he aligned with the family's skippers, including boss Vincent Gigante. Giovanelli claimed Gigante was \\"the biggest cheater\\" he knew at card games.

Giovanelli was charged with the murder. Burke testified that Giovanelli had shot at her, though Giovanelli denied she was a witness to the scene. The first trial in the summer of 1987 ended in deadlock after Burke was combative and testy under the defense lawyers' questioning. The second trial in 1988 also ended in deadlock after a major prosecution witness withdrew the part of his testimony in which he had said Carmine Gualtiere was one of the gunmen who had killed Detective Venditti.

Nyendwoha Akiiki of the Bakwonga clan and Jane Nsungwa Nyendwoha Adyeri, from the Babiito clan, in 1925. Both her parents were teachers. Sarah started school in kindergarten class at Duhaga Girls' School in Hoima where she studied up to Primary 4. In 1938 she joined King's College Budo, where she studied for eight years, from Primary 5 to Secondary 6 (1938-1945). At the end of these years, she sat the Makerere College entrance examinations and was admitted to Makerere College to train as a teacher. She finished three years, doing history, geography, English and teacher training. She was denied the opportunity to study Mathematics because the Maths Tutor said he did not teach girls. She did her teaching practice at King's College Budo and Kyebambe Girls’ School and later received a teaching certificate. In 1951, she joined Oxford University where graduated with a bachelor's degree in History in 1954. She was the first East and Central African woman to graduate from Oxford University at a time when no tertiary institutions granted degrees in East Africa. == Career == Her first working stint was at Kyebambe Girls’ School in Fort Portal. In 1955, she joined Gayaza High School. She later had to leave Gayaza High School and join Duhaga Junior Secondary School (DJSS) in Hoima where she taught for two years before she resigned from active teaching service in 1958. Sarah's involvement in civil society work started way back while she was at school in the 1940s. For example, when she was at King's College Budo, she was invited by one of her teachers to help teach English to Polish refugees. The teacher was married to the commandant of the refugee camp in Budongo Forest and the refugees had been brought to Uganda after World War II. In the late 1950s, when the British announced they were to grant Uganda independence, she started civic education sessions at the Hoima district headquarters to discuss democracy and elections. She served in the Uganda Legislative Council from 1958-1961 where she tabled a private member's bill on the Registration of Marriages in 1961 and was involved in women's organisations like the Uganda Council of Women and YWCA (U). from 1965 to August 1967, she worked at the Ministry of Education as the secretary to the Teaching Service Committee. In September 1967, she joined Kings College Budo as a teacher. In 1971, she resigned from teaching at King's College Budo and joined Makerere University as an assistant secretary in the University secretary's office and clerk to the Makerere University Council, handling matters of the University Council (1971-1976). In 1976, she was transferred from the office of the University secretary to the joint administration of the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Social Sciences where she worked until October 1978. While at Makerere, she was also a Director of the East African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC). == Breaking barriers == Her championing of women's rights in Uganda has come a long way. Soon after her arrival at Gayaza High School, she discovered that her salary was to be less than that of her male colleagues. In protest of this, she offered to work without any pay for one year to repay for sponsoring her studies. After one academic year, she told them, she would resign and find employment that would pay her, not as a woman, but as a worker, an ordinary employee. Her action yielded results. The Headmistress reported her action to the wife of the Governor, Sir Andrew Cohen who approached her at the school. She stood her ground and after this meeting, she received equal pay for equal work done. This was how she broke the barrier of unequal pay. == Family == She married Sam Joseph Ntiro in December 1958.

Examples include dense suspensions of bacteria, microtubule networks or artificial swimmers. These materials come under the broad category of active matter and differ significantly in properties when compared to passive fluids, which can be described using Navier-Stokes equation. Even though systems describable as active fluids have been observed and investigated in different contexts for a long time, scientific interest in properties directly related to the activity has emerged only in the past two decades. These materials have been shown to exhibit a variety of different phases ranging from well ordered patterns to chaotic states (see below). Recent experimental investigations have suggested that the various dynamical phases exhibited by active fluids may have important technological applications. == Terminology == The terms “active fluids”, “active nematics” and “active liquid crystals” have been used almost synonymously to denote hydrodynamic descriptions of dense active matter. While in many respects they describe the same phenomenon, there are subtle differences between them. “Active nematics” and “active liquid crystals” refers to systems where the constituent elements have nematic order whereas “active fluids” is the more generic term combining systems with both nematic and polar interactions. == Examples and observations == There are wide range of cellular and intracellular elements which form active fluids. This include systems of microtubule, bacteria, sperm cells as well as inanimate microswimmers. It is known that these systems form a variety of structures such as regular and irregular lattices as well as seemingly random states in two dimensions. === Pattern formation === Active fluids have been shown to organize into regular and irregular lattices in a variety of settings. These include irregular hexagonal lattices by microtubules and regular vortex lattice by sperm cells. From topological considerations, it can be seen that the constituent element in quasi stationary states of active fluids should necessarily be vortices. But very less is known, for instance, about the length scale selection in such systems. === Active turbulence === Chaotic states exhibited by active fluids are termed as active turbulence. Such states are qualitatively similar to hydrodynamic turbulence, by virtue of which they are termed active turbulence. But recent research has indicated that the statistical properties associated with such flows are quite different from that of hydrodynamic turbulence. == Mechanism and modelling approaches == The mechanism behind the formation of various structures in active fluids is an area of active research. It is well understood that the structure formation in active fluids is intimately related to defects or disclinations in the order parameter field (the orientational order of the constituent agents). An important part of research on active fluids involve modelling of dynamics of these defects to study its role in pattern formation and turbulent dynamics in active fluids. Modified versions of Vicsek model are among earliest and continually used approach to model active fluids. Such models have been shown to capture the various dynamical states exhibited by active fluids. More refined approaches include derivation of continuum limit hydrodynamic equations for active fluids and adaptation of liquid crystal theory by including the activity terms. == Potential applications == A few technological applications for active fluids have been proposed such as powering of molecular motors through active turbulence and patterned state. Furthermore, given the innumerable applications liquid crystals find in various technologies, there have been proposals to augment them by using active liquid crystals. == See also == * Active matter * Vicsek model * Navier Stokes equations * Soft matter == References == Category:Soft matter Category:Condensed matter physics ","title":"Active fluid"},{"id":"56784416","text":"Balarama Deva or Balaram Deo (Odia: ବଳରାମ୍ ଦେବ୍) was the first Chauhan ruler of Sambalpur line of Chauhan rulers and the tenth in line ruler of the Chauhan dynasty in the Western Odisha region during the sixteenth century. He was a powerful ruler and an excellent military strategist who ruled the hilly and forest tracts of western Odisha that was mostly inhabited by different tribal or aboriginal communities. After his ascension to the throne in the year 1575 A.D, he secured the region from the neighboring Ratanpur's Haihayas and build a strong state surpassing the glory of his ancestral Chauhan state of Patna (Bolangir). Balarama Deva had also provided military assistance to the Gajapati king Ramachandra Deva of Khurda Kingdom and help to defend Khurda kingdom from the invading Muslim armies who either belonged to the Mughal Dynasty or the Golconda Sultanate. After consolidation of his authority over the regions of western Odisha and now parts of the state of Chattishgarh, Balarama Deva himself installed the idol of Goddess Samleswari as the head family deity which began the era of cultural rejuvenation in the region. == Initial Days in the Service of the Patna State == After the death of the last hegemonic Gajapati Mukunda Deva in the Gohiratikri battlefield in 1568 AD, the Afghans and Mughals subsequently struggled for authority and an era of chaos had ensued. During the last quarter of the sixteenth century, Odisha was undergoing several political disturbances leading to the subsequent collapse of the central authority. The authority of the Gajapati kings of Odisha was starting to lose its imperial status and the glorious title of 'Gajapati' had begun to get limited to the rulers of a very small region of today's Khurda, Puri, Nayagarh and Cuttack districts of coastal Odisha. Though Gajapati Kings lost their sovereignty, they remain the tutelary head and Odisha princely states and ancient Zamindaris establishes and flourished under Gajapati era. During the rule of Gajapati Ramachandra Deva of Khurda, the forces of the Afghans of Bengal invaded again and again while the Mughals closely contested them for control of the region through repeated clashes. As described in the Kosalananda Kavya, Balarama Deva was sent with a force of 32,000 infantry, 700 cavalry and 30 war elephants to assist the Gajapati king by his father Hiradhara Deva. Balarama Deva was instrumental in asserting the Independence of the Chauhan rule in the Patna state during this period. He also defeated the king of neighboring Bastar region who tried to take over the regions of western Odisha. == Foundation and Integration of the new Sambalpur State  Folklore on Partition of the Chauhan Territory === There are two different existing folklore which describes how Balarama Deva got to rule the northern part their ancestral kingdom around today's Sambalpur while his brother Narasimha Deva continued the rule from Patna. The first folklore speaks of Balarama Deva crossing the river Mayavati in the dark night to bring a nurse so that she could help his pregnant sister in law and the wife of Narasimha Deva who had gone to labor. His elder brother being very thankful gave him the northern part of his territory to rule. The second folklore narrates that there was an existing strife between the two brothers for accession to the throne when their mother intervened. She led both of them to a village called Kalapathar on the banks of river Ong and asked Narasimha to stand on the right bank of the river while Balarama was asked to stand on the left bank. She declared that the river would mark their boundary any attempt against it will be considered as a crime against her. In another case, the poem Jaya Chandrika written by Prahallad Dubey, the court poet of Sarangarh kingdom in the 18th Century, states that, Balarama Deva was fond of hunting and to fulfill his wishes he asked his mother for the region of Sambalpur which was situated on the bank of river Mahanadi and known for the diamond mines. === Partition Due to Kalachuri Haihaya Threat === The neighboring Haihaya ruler Kalyan Sahai had declared himself as the overlord of forty eight princely states and forts which included large parts of western Odisha along with Patna. Due to the threat of conquest from the enemy and effective decentralized administration of the Chauhan kingdom, Balarama Deva was asked to practice his authority and guardianship separately in the northern areas by his ruling brother Narasimha Deva. The Haihaya threat never materialized once Balarama Deva effectively practiced his rule on the region. Eventually after the death of Narasimha Deva, the Patna state became unimportant due to the growing effectiveness of the newly founded Sambalpur state by Balarama Deva. The poem Jaya Chandrika describes the kingdom as Huma Desha where the river Jira flowed and the center of power was located at Bargarh. Eventually to strengthen his defensive position, Balarama shifted his capital first to Chaunrpur and then to Sambalpur on the banks of river Mahanadi. === Military Conquests in the Region and Control Over Patna === Balarama deva dealt first with the Ratanpur Haihaya threat by defeating the reigning king Lakshman Sahai after the death of Kalyan Sahai and conquered the neighboring regions of Raigarh, Sakti, Sarangarh and parts of Bargarh. The states of Surguja and Gangpur became feudatory states of Sambalpur. The Ganga kingdom of Bamanda also became a vassal state after it was conquered and Rama Chandra Deva was appointed as feudal king under the authority of Sambalpur. During his conquests, the Gangpur ruler gave away his daughter Kamala Kumari in marriage to Balarama Deva and also he subsequently married another self ruling princess of Surguja when the kingdom was defeated by him. During Balarama Deva the new state was secured with eighteen forts also popularly known as Atharagarh and one of the main fort itself was the Bargarh fort which was initially built or restored by Balarama Deva as center of his power. There were also thirteen divisions in his new state. After the death of his brother Narasimha Deva and again the death of the new successor Hamira Deva in a short span of three years, Balarama Deva sent his son Hridayanarayana Deva to rule the parent state of Patna. However, the widowed queen and the ministers complained against his rule. When the matters were investigated it was found that the corrupt ministers had created trouble in the practicing of effective authority by Hridayanarayana. Enraged by this event, Balarama expelled the ministers and the queen mother who later took shelter in the southern areas Nandpur. == Cultural Contribution and Historical Impact == Samaleswari temple that was originally built by Balarama Deva after installing the deity under a Simuli tree and later his descendant Chhatra Sai Deo rebuild the sanctum to its present form after a century. Balarama Deva had undertaken certain significant constructional and cultural restoration initiatives in his new kingdom. The foremost and the highly important step during his rule was to establish goddess Samleswari as the head deity of his state. Samleswari was adored by the local tribal population before in the region and their allegiance was won for himself due to this. It is also believed that the harvest festival of Nuakhai dedicated to goddess Samleswari, widely celebrated across western Odisha and neighboring regions was initiated by him. After defeating Surguja, he brought back an idol of Ananta Saya as trophy for his victory and build a temple at Sambalpur for the deity. At the height of his power the newly founded kingdom at Sambalpur extended from the river Mahanadi in the north to the river Ong in the south and from the Surangi in Phuljhar in the west to Huma on the Mahanadi in the east. He employed the Johoras for the collecting diamonds from the river bed of Mahanadi and granted them the villages of Hirakud and Junani. He granted lands to Brahmins and rebuilt or renovated the Huma temple. A temple for goddess Patneswari was built at Sambalpur during his rule. Despite the collapse of central authority and disintegration of Odisha in the sixteenth century caused by successive invasions and betrayal within the bureaucracy, Balarama Deva was able to secure and expand the parts of his kingdom. He ensured stability, security, law and order over his new kingdom by bringing together all his subjects.

Sexual harassment in the military is unwanted sexual behaviour, which is defined as threatening, offensive, or otherwise upsetting to others in a military setting. The behaviour is more common in the military than in civilian life. Women are substantially more likely than men to experience sexual harassment in the armed forces. Other groups at higher risk include child cadets/recruits and military detainees. == Definitions == Sexual harassment is unwanted sexual behaviour which is threatening or otherwise upsetting to others. Some example definitions in use by state armed forces are: * Australian Defence Forces: Unwanted sexual advances or sexual requests towards to another person * British Army: Unwanted sexually based conduct or other conduct affecting the dignity of women and men at work. * Canadian Armed Forces: Improper conduct directed at and offensive to others, which the perpetrator ought reasonably know would be so. * United States Armed Forces: Unwanted sexual advances and other behaviour of a sexual nature. == Behaviour == Sexual harassment in the military includes a broad spectrum of behaviour. Undirected behaviours that affect the working environment, such as sexist jokes and the prominent display of pornographic material, may constitute sexual harassment, as do directed behaviours targeted at one or more individuals, such as unwanted sexual advances and sexual assault. Research in Canada has found that a culture of undirected sexual harassment increases the risk of directed sexual harassment and assault. === Case examples === In the British army, a woman told the following story to researchers in 2006: > ‘A friend was out on an exercise when a group of men ducked her head in a > bucket of water and each time she came up for breath she had to repeat “I am > useless and I am a female”. She told the story and said it was a joke but I > could see she was upset.’ In the Canadian armed forces, demeaning attitudes to women are pervasive, according to the Deschamps Review of 2015: > 'Interviewees reported regularly being told of orders to “stop being > pussies” and to “leave your purses at home” [...] The use of the word > “cunt”, for example, is commonplace, and rape jokes are tolerated. [...] A > commonly held attitude is that, rather than be a soldier, a sailor or an > aviator, a woman will be labeled an “ice princess”, a “bitch”, or a “slut”. > Another saying is that women enter the CAF “to find a man, to leave a man, > or to become a man”.' A woman in the French army, pseudonymised by the Independent newspaper as Captain Carole, was raped by her commanding officer: > 'It was months before I could pronounce the word \\"rape\\"... I blamed myself. > I said: \\"We are trained in hand to hand combat. Why didn’t I stop him?\\" But > when that happens you are terrorised.' In the US Army, a woman recalls attending a class for sexual abuse and sexual harassment training, titled 'personal development training'. The senior officer teaching the class asked participants whether they would hit on 'a naked, drunk girl on the bench outside your barracks', adding, 'you're not supposed to but I probably would.' US Senator Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican, said during a Senate meeting on sexual assault in the military that she was raped by a superior officer in the US Air Force. McSally was the first female pilot in the US Air Force to fly in combat operations. She said that she never reported the rape because she did not trust the military justice system; she also said that she blamed herself for the incident, and that she had thought she was strong but felt powerless. == Prevalence and risk factors == Studies of sexual harassment have found that it is markedly more common in military than civilian settings. Several reasons for this have been suggested. A Canadian study found that key risk factors associated with military settings are the typically young age of personnel, the isolated locations of bases, the minority status of women, and the disproportionate number of men in senior positions. Other Canadian research has found that an emphasis in military organisations on conformity, obedience, and hierarchical power relations, combine to increase the risk, particularly to personnel of low rank, who are less able than others to resist inappropriate expectations made of them. The traditionally masculine values and behaviours that are rewarded and reinforced in military settings are also thought to play a role. Canadian research has also found that the risk of sexual misconduct increases during deployment on military operations. == Principal targets  Female personnel === While some male personnel are sexually harassed, women are substantially more likely to be affected. Women who are younger and joined the military at a younger age face a greater risk, according to American, British, Canadian, and French research. === Child cadets === Cadet forces are military youth organisations for younger teenagers based in communities and schools, and are common around the world. There is some evidence from the UK, where hundreds of complaints of the sexual abuse of cadets have been recorded since 2012, and from Canada, where one in ten complaints of sexual assault in the military are from cadets, that these institutions are susceptible to a culture of sexual harassment. === Detainees === Individuals detained by the military are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment. During the Iraq War, for example, personnel of the US army and US Central Intelligence Agency committed a number of human rights violations against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison, including rape, sodomy, and other forms of sexual abuse. Another example is the detention of two Iraqi men on a British warship at the start of the Iraq War, when they were made to strip naked and were then sexually humiliated. == Barriers to redress == Although the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents. For example: * An official report of the Australian Defence Force concluded that women affected by harassment were less likely to make a complaint because they do not expect a serious response. * The ombudsman of the Canadian armed forces confirmed that women fear the consequences if they report a sexual offence against them to their chain of command: 'The fear of repercussions is blatant,' he said in 2014. In 2015, the Deschamps Review reported that one of the main reasons why personnel do not lodge a complaint is a fear of the consequences for their career and that there had many complainants had faced reprisals. * Leila Minano, the co-author of a book documenting sexual abuse in the French armed forces, commented that complaints from women were systematically discouraged from complaining, and were often moved out of their unit if they did so. * In the UK, an official report on sexual harassment in the British army found that almost half of personnel who had an 'upsetting' experience of sexual harassment did not complain for fear of an impact on their career. * In the US armed forces, a study in 2016 found that 58% of women who reported sexual misconduct by peers said that they had met with retaliation as a consequence. The Department of Defense estimated in 2017 that two in three victims of sexual assault do not report it. Since the number of official complaints represents only a fraction of sexual harassment in the military, armed forces that have committed to reduce prevalence produce periodic estimates of its extent using anonymised surveys. == Mental health effects == Women affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer stress-related mental illness afterwards. Research in the US found that when sexual abuse of female military personnel is psychiatrically traumatic, the odds of suffering from post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine. Research in the US has found that personnel affected by sexual harassment are somewhat less likely to develop depression or PTSD if a formal report leads to effective action to address the issue. == Prevention == link=thumb Poster created by the U.S. Army's Sexual Harassment/Assault Response & Prevention (SHARP) The military leadership in some countries has begun to acknowledge a culture of sexual misconduct in the armed forces. For example: * The British armed forces co-commissioned their first formal study of the problem in 2006, and in 2016 the head of the British army noted the ‘overly sexualised’ soldier culture and committed to reducing the extent of sexual misconduct. * In 2016, after a major study uncovered widespread sexual harassment and assault in the Canadian armed forces, General Jonathan Vance, Chief of the Defence Staff, acknowledged: 'Harmful sexual behaviour is a real problem in our institution.' * The US established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office in 2005, which reports annually. == Sexual harassment in the military, by country  Australia === Widespread reports of sexual harassment in the Australian armed forces led to the establishment of the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce to investigate complaints from women between 1991 and 2011. It received 2,439 complaints, of which it deemed 1,751 to be plausible. A Royal Commission into institutional child sexual abuse was established in 2012, which investigated widespread allegations of historical abuse in the navy. The Commission took evidence from 8,000 individuals and reported in 2017 that many recruits of both sexes and from the age of 15 had been repeatedly sexually abused by older recruits between 1967 and 1971, including by anal gang rape, and in some cases young recruits had been forced to rape each other. The practice was ‘tolerated’ by senior staff, according to the Commission. === Canada === According to official statistics gathered by Maclean's magazine, the Canadian military police received an average of 178 complaints of sexual assault per year between 2000 and 2014, representing an estimated 10% of all cases. In 2014, the ombudsman of the Canadian armed forces described sexual harassment in the institution as 'a huge problem'. In 2015, after widespread allegations of sexual misconduct in the military, a major official report, the External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces (the Deschamps Review), was published. It found that sexual harassment was commonplace and embedded in military culture, and that pervasive degrading attitudes to women and LGBTQ personnel were jeopardising their safety. The Deschamps Review also criticised the armed forces for a culture of dismissiveness. One male interview told the Review, for example: \\"Girls that come to the Army know what to expect.\\" It stated that senior NCOs are frequently seen as tolerating sexual harassment and discouraging the individuals affected from making a complaint. The following year, in 2016, a major study of 43,000 Canadian armed forces personnel reported that 27% of female personnel reported at least one incident of sexual assault since they joined the military, and 5% of female regular armed forces personnel reported the same in the previous 12 months (equivalent to approximately 960 women per year). === France === The extent of sexual harassment in the French armed forces first came to light in 2014 when 35 cases of sexual harassment and assault were detailed in La Guerre Invisible, a book by Leila Minano and Julia Pascual. According to the Independent newspaper, the armed forces had not been required to report incidents or to keep statistics, and an official report acknowledged that awareness of the problem had been institutionally suppressed. === United Kingdom === Following concerns expressed in 2004 by the UK Equal Opportunities Commission (now the Equality and Human Rights Commission) about persistent sexual harassment in the British armed forces, a number of anonymised, official surveys have been undertaken. The first, in 2006, found that a male-dominated culture sexualised women and diminished their military competence. Among the comments made to researchers by male personnel about their female counterparts were: ‘Ok there are a few exceptions but on the whole they [women] shouldn’t be here.’; 'They're all lesbians or sluts.'; and 'They are emotionally unstable.' The report found that 15% of women had had a 'particularly upsetting' experience of sexual harassment in the previous 12 months; the proportion rose to 20% in the youngest age group. A similar survey in 2009 found the 8% of women in the army had had a ‘particularly upsetting’ experience in the previous 12 months, and the most recent survey, in 2015, found that 13% of women reported the same. In 2017, a BBC Panorama documentary found multiple cases of the sexual abuse of cadets from age 11 during the 1980s, and reported that the victims and their parents were discouraged from making a formal complaint or contacting the police. The Ministry of Defence paid £2 million in 2012 and 2013 to settle allegations of the child sexual abuse of military cadets, and between 2012 and 2017 recorded a further 363 allegations, of which 282 were referred to the police.http://digital.films.com/p_ViewVideo.aspx?xtid=142574 === United States === The Navy's 1991 Tailhook scandal exposed the egregious acts that occurred during the 35th annual convention in Las Vegas, NV, where 100 Navy and Marine Corp. aviation officers sexually assaulted 83 women and 7 men. Active Navy Lieutenant, aviator, victim, and whistleblower, Paula Coughlin, appeared before congress in 1991 to testify about the sexual abuse and sexual harassment she endured at the hands of her comrades at Tailhook. Her testimony led to improved regulations intended to combat sexual harassment and assault in the military. Accurate statistics of sexual harassment in the armed forces are elusive as the Pentagon tracks only reports of sexual assault, not sexual harassment. A 2017 Department of Defense report for the 2016 fiscal year indicates that reported incidents of sexual assault increased 10 percent over the previous year, and most often, active duty members were victimized by higher ranking service members. It further states that the Department of Defense does not specifically confirm that sexual harassment causes sexual assault in the armed forces, but does confirm that the two are inexplicably intertwined. The report found that an active duty military woman who reported sexual harassment to a superior was 16 percent more likely to be sexually assaulted than one who did not report, while a man who reported increased his chance of sexual assault after reporting by 50 percent. In 2017, the Department of Defense reported that an estimated 14,900 military personnel were sexually assaulted in 2016, of whom 6,172 made an official complaint. According to an article published in Medscape, up to 80% of women in the armed forces have been sexually harassed, and 25% have experienced a sexual assault. == See also == * Sexual harassment * Wartime sexual violence * Military sexual trauma * Women in the military * Children in the military * Sexual assault in the United States military == References Further reading== * == External links  Research === * British army: Rutherford Report, 2006, Sexual Harassment Report, 2015, The First Ambush?

The varied techniques which evolved over the next hundred years in the farming community were subsequently developed by the middle classes until around 1820. They were applied to articles of clothing such as collars and cuffs but were also used to decorate bed linen. ==Introduction== Related to reticella, hedebo is a form of needle lace which was originally produced by farming women in the area of Zealand known as Hedebo or Hedeboegnen, the flat heathland bordered by Copenhagen, Roskilde and Køge. Up to the 1870s, the embroidered articles decorated the peasants' living rooms or featured on their festive clothing. Towels and pillows as well as women's shifts and men's shirts were typically decorated in the hedebo style. Many of the items in a bride's trousseau or bridal chest were painstakingly prepared for a future wedding. In the late 19th century, Copenhagen families began to show interest in hedebo, increasingly acquiring items for their own homes. Many were crafted by the wet nurses whom they employed. Designs were often adapted to match the clothing styles of the middle classes. By the 20th century, it became fashionable for educated Copenhagen women also to sew hebedo embroidery themselves. When hedebo was replaced in the late 19th century by more modern styles, peasants sold their embroidery in Copenhagen for substantial sums. Many items were nevertheless passed down as families appreciated the value of the embroidery. Recognized by the Danish Folk Museum as a national treasure in the 1870s, many Zealand museums now have substantial collections of hedebo items. ==Stitching styles== Hedebo styles have developed over the years, first by the farming women and later by embroidery experts living in the more wealthy areas of Copenhagen. The earlier styles (1700–1870), known as Hedebosyning (Hedebo sewing), consisted of white linen work for creating articles for private use. They can be classified under seven distinct styles. ===Counted thread work=== Known in Danish as tællesyning, with its geometric patterns, it is a style common throughout Denmark and the rest of Europe. Nevertheless, the number of finely stitched hedebo articles is particularly high. Designs can be based on triangles, trees, animals and human figures. The style is used for shirts, bed linen and handkerchiefs. ===Drawn thread work=== Drawn thread work or dragværk, another whitework technique, dates from the second half of the 18th century. Employing the warp and weft approach, white thread is drawn across the width of the white linen before figures such as animals are sewn in. The embroidery follows the length and intersections of the fabric. The remaining threads can be decorated in different designs with buttonhole stitches. ===Square cutwork=== Square cutwork or rudesyning was used until the end of the 19th century for monograms and for decorating towels. From the ground material, squares are cut out, leaving some threads between the squares. A darning stitch can then be used to fill them in, creating patterns of animals, human figures, plants and trees. ===Hvidsøm=== The hvidsøm whitework technique combines drawn thread and cutwork. A type of embroidered lace, it consists of two rows of chain stitches around the main motif. It was used for both clothing and household items such as pillow cases and towels. It was also used by middle class women for tea cosies and table cloths until the mid-20th century. Motifs include flowers, hearts, leaves and animals. ===Baldyring=== Combining the drawn thread and counted thread techniques, baldyring is based on reticella needlework. It was used for pillow cases, men's shirts, women's shifts as well as for towels and sheets. Its use extended to the whole of Denmark by the end of the 19th century. It also became fashionable among urban women until about 1920. ===Hedebo needle lace=== Udklipshedebo or Hedebo needle lace, is often considered a freestyle combination of cut work and embroidered lace techniques. It also incorporated button stitch and scallop stitch. Patterns are filled with curves, points and wheels or rings, often surrounded by leaves. It was used for costumes, small cloths and collars. It could be found in homes throughout Denmark for serviettes, tea cosies and decorated collars for women. ==References * Category:Textile arts of Denmark Category:Embroidery in Denmark Category:Textile patterns ","title":"Hedebo embroidery"},{"id":"56784467","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

The district extends to Fourteen Mile Road on the north, Scenic Drive on the south, the Rouge River on the east, and several hundred feet from Franklin Road on the west. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, and added to in 2005. It was Michigan's first district to be listed on the National Register. ==History== The village of Franklin was founded by European Americans in 1824, and by 1828 had nine families, a US postmaster, and a school. By 1830 a business center was beginning to develop in the heart of what is now this historic district. Several of the early businesses, such as the former Broughton Wagon Shop and the Van Every Mill, are still extant in essentially their original condition. Franklin grew slowly for the rest of the nineteenth century. After World War I, however, many Detroit residents began relocating in the suburbs, as the population of the city continued to expand rapidly and new housing was needed. In 1926, the first formal platting of the village took place. Further population shifts accompanied highway construction and suburbanization after World War II, resulting in a development boom in this area. To prevent overdevelopment in Franklin, in the early 1970s The Franklin Historical Society began efforts to enact zoning laws to restrict it. ==Description== The original portion of the historic district along Franklin Road approximately follows the boundaries of Franklin in the early 1870s. This section of the district includes 26 historically significant properties, many dating to the mid-1830s. The expanded district includes nearly 150 buildings total, of which about 100 are considered contributing as historically significant. The district is located along or adjacent to Franklin Road. Some of the most significant structures include: * Franklin Cemetery (comer of Franklin Road and Scenic Drive), a six-acre cemetery with monuments ranging from 1829 to the present. * House (32020 Franklin Road), a 1929 slate-roofed Tudor structure. * Franklin Village School (32220 Franklin Road), large brick structure constructed in 1923, with two rear additions. * Broughton House (32325 Franklin Road), a Greek Revival house constructed in the 1830s and now used as the village hall. * J.J. Trott House (26110 Carol), an 1850 Greek Revival style house. * Franklin Village Library * Franklin Community Church (32473 Normandy Road), a large, prominent structure built in 1956. * Methodist Protestant Church (26109 German Mill Road), now a private residence; served successively as the primary house of worship for several of the village's different religious denominations. * Market Basket (32652 Franklin Road), constructed as a general store in 1900. * Franklin Hotel (32751 Franklin Road), constructed in 1831. * Temperance Hotel (32800 Franklin Road), constructed in 1840. * Franklin Cider Mill (7450 Franklin Road), a wood-frame structure built in 1837, which served the village as a grist mill until 1949, when it was converted into a cider mill. ==Gallery== File: Franklin MI Cemetery.JPGFranklin Cemetery File:Franklin Village School.JPGFranklin Village School File:Farmhousecoffee.JPGFarmhouse Coffee on Franklin Road File:MarketBasket.JPGMarket Basket on Franklin Road File:Franklin Michigan Banner.jpgFranklin Community Church ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland County, Michigan Category:Greek Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Michigan ","title":"Franklin Historic District (Franklin, Michigan)"},{"id":"56784505","text":"Henry Alfred Broome (1826 – 2 November 1865) was a boxer from the bare-knuckle fighting era who became heavyweight champion of England in September, 1851 when he defeated fellow Englishman William Perry in Mildenhall, England. He lost the title in May, 1856 to Tom Paddock in Suffolk. ==Early life== Born in Birmingham in 1826, Harry Broome was the younger brother of undefeated English boxer Johnny Broome who influenced him to become a boxer as well. ==Boxing career== Though only 17, Broome had two London bouts in 1842, an exhibition and a win against Byng Stocks and Hal Mitchell, which may have been considered amateur bouts, as they were fought with gloves. With the guidance of his brother Johnny, Harry Broome's professional fighting career began on 11 October 1843 when he defeated Fred Mason at Northfleet, Kent, for a total purse of £100, £50 per side. One source quoted his weight, likely with accuracy, as only 136 pounds or 9 stone, 10, a light welterweight, and his age as barely eighteen.Total purse £100 in \\"Pugilistic Contest for £100\\", Lloyd's Weekly, pg. 8 (right lower corner of page), 15 October 1843 According to one report, the two fought \\"a well contested battle of eighty-one minutes, during which thirty-nine rounds were fought\\". Broome did his best work, near the end of the match, most frequently leading with his left. The fighting was fierce from the opening round, and both men left the ring exhausted. In 1844 he was matched with Joe Rowe for £50 a side. The bout took place on 10 December 1844 at Greenhithe, Kent but after a desperate battle lasting 90 minutes and 81 rounds, a riot by the crowd broke the ring and ended the bout. Both men landed blows, but Rowe may have taken a slight lead at the end. Broome subsequently beat Rowe in a rearranged fight on 13 May 1845. Both bouts were fought in the welterweight range, and according to one source were for the English welterweight title.\\"Prize Fight for £100\\", Lloyd's Weekly, London, England, pg. 12, 15 December 1844 Broome's next fight was against Ben Terry of Birmingham in Shrivenham, England. Still fighting as a welterweight, Broome was said to have weighed around 10 stone, 4, or 144 pounds. The bout took place on 3 February 1846 and ended being declared a draw after an hour of fighting when a furious dispute broke out over a claimed \\"foul\\" which led to the referee fleeing the scene of the fight, unable to render a decision. Broome received only £5 for the bout. ===Heavyweight champion of England, 1851=== Broome's career reached a peak in 1851 when, fighting above his weight, he defeated William Perry, the \\"Tipton Slasher\\". The match took place at Mildenhall, England on 29 September 1851 for the impressive purse of £400. In the third round, Perry fell heavily to the ground. In the seventh, Perry hit the ground hard as he was thrown by Broome, and the heavy man was thrown at least once in subsequent rounds, a wrestling tactic allowed under London Prize Ring Rules. Perry was fought down after a scrambling rally in the fourteenth. After some exchanges in the fifteenth round, Broome missed and slipped onto his knees. Perry seized him by his right arm and dragged him as if to get him up, striking him \\"intemperately\\", on the side of the head while he was down. Broome was subsequently awarded victory for the foul of striking Broome while he was on his knees.Perry slipped in \\"Broome and Perry for 400 pounds\\", Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper, London, England, pg. 10, 5 October 1851 The outcome of this fight enabled Broome to claim the title of heavyweight champion of England, and take the championship belt.Perry fell down in the third in \\"The Championship of England\\", Liverpool Mercury, Liverpool, England, pg. 6, 3 October 1851 ===Defences of English championship, 1853=== Broome (right) and Orme, 1853 Tom Paddock Broome defended the heavyweight championship of England only once successfully against Henry Orme on a warm 18 April 1853, winning in a thirty-one round fight in Brandon, Suffolk, that lasted 2 hours, and eighteen minutes. The substantial purse was £500 with £250 per side, and the audience numbered in the thousands. Broome was roughly two inches taller than his adversary, but described as fleshy and not as fit in appearance, with the skin \\"loose on his arms\\". He may have lost some conditioning during his work as a pub keeper between fights. He likely fought as a light heavyweight at best, as his competition weight was not known to exceed 175. Regardless of his condition, the bout was described as one of his best, and he fought convincingly.For 500 pounds, Broome was fleshy, in \\"Pugilism\\", Reynold's Newspaper, London, England, pg. 5, 24 April 1853Audience of 1000s in \\"Pugilism\\", The Newcastle Weekly Courant, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England, pg. 3, 22 April 1853 In August 1853, Broome wrote to Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle announcing his retirement from boxing and that he was pulling out of an agreed re-match with William Perry. Broome had two fights scheduled with Tom Paddock in February and March of 1855, but Paddock failed to show for either bout. Loss of English championship On his second defense of the English title, Broome lost a fifty-one round match to Paddock at Bentley in Sussex on 19 May 1856, in Manningtree, England in one hour, three minutes. Broome was losing favor somewhat or the bout was less well attended, but the purse was only £200 a side, a sustantial sum, but a drop from the purse of Broome's first two championship wins. Boxing was not sanctioned by most English cities, which is why remote locations were required. To avoid the police, the spot found for the fight was on a piece of meadow ground in a hollow where the contestants and supporters could scarcely be seen. Broome had lost as much as 40 pounds for the contest, but did not appear as muscular as he had in earlier contests. His determination was substantial, but his stamina was described as inadequate against the vigor and strength of his opponent.Stronger opponent in \\"Fight for the Championship\\", The Morning Post, London, England, pg. 6, 26 May 1856 By the 48th round, the left side of Broome's face was quite swollen, and his left eye nearly swollen shut. Broome fell in the 49th from a blow to his left ear. In the brutal affair, Broome was down again in the 50th. In the 51st and final round, Broome was down from a right to the chest, and though he tried to rise, his second threw in the sponge. Though the betting favorite early on, Broome was described as \\"completely disabled\\" and presented a \\"shocking spectacle\\" by the end of the fight. He attempted to retire immediately after the disabling loss.A shocking spectacle in \\"Prize Fight\\", Hampshire Telegraph, Hampshire, Portsmouth, England, pg. 8, 24 May 1856\\"Prizefight\\", The Lancaster Gazette, Lancaster, Lancashire, England, pg. 8, 31 May 1856\\"Sir William Williams\\", Leicester Chronicle, Leicester, England, pg. 4, 24 May 1856 ==After retirement== Norwood Cemetery After finishing his fighting career he kept a pub in Portsmouth and later kept the \\"Crown and Cushion\\" in Little Russell Street, London. In later years, he was often found wagering money at race meetings which may have contributed to his poverty in later life. Near the end of his life, he suffered for months from lung disease and \\"dropsy\\", now known as edema. After being released from hospital care, he died in poverty due to his medical expenses, on the evening of 2 November 1865 at his residence on 30 Frith Street, in London's Soho. He was survived by his wife, who cared for him during his illness, and two children. He was buried in Norwood Cemetery in the same tomb as his brother, Johnny Broome, requiring patrons to pay the sum of £4 for the burial.\\"Death of Harry Broome\\", Lloyd's Weekly, Greater London, England, pg. 12, 5 November 1865Released from hospital, had two children in \\"Racing Fixtures For 1865\\", Birmingham Daily Post, Birmingham, England, pg. 3, 6 November 1865 ==Career record== -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=84 Wins, 1 Loss, 2 Draws -  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Result  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Opponent  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border- style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Date  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Location  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Duration  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Notes -  Win  Fred Mason  11 October 1843 Northfleet, Kent  39 rounds  Welterweight championship -  style=\\"background: #dae2f1\\"Draw  Joe Rowe  10 December 1844  Greenhithe, Kent  81 rounds  Welterweight championship -  Win  Joe Rowe  13 May 1845  Ensham Common  27 rounds  Welterweight championship -  style=\\"background: #dae2f1\\"Draw  Ben Terry  3 February 1846  Shrivenham , Berks  49 rounds  Crowd rioted due to foul, referee fled -  Win  William Perry  29 September 1851  Mildenhall, Suffolk  15 rounds  Won English Heavyweight championship -  Win  Harry Orme 18 April 1853  Brandon, Suffolk  31 rounds  Defended English championship -  Loss  Tom Paddock  19 May 1856  Bentley, Sussex  51 rounds  Lost English championship, retired ==See also== *List of heavyweight bare-knuckle boxing champions, includes nearly all bare-knuckle all England champions *List of bare-knuckle boxers ==References== Category:1826 births Category:1865 deaths Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Bare-knuckle boxers Category:English male boxers Category:Burials at West Norwood Cemetery ","title":"Harry Broome"},{"id":"56784534","text":"Yūichi Sugita was the defending champion but chose not to defend his title.

It is mainly located in the state of Brandenburg south of Berlin, but a small part of it is in Berlin. It is mainly intended to connect Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) with the underground Berlin Brandenburg Airport station. Its eastern section replaced the Berlin- Grünau – Berlin Schönefeld Airport South railway (Bahnstrecke Berlin-Grünau – Berlin Flughafen Schönefeld Süd), which was opened in 1963. This ran parallel to the current line and was mainly used to supply the airport with fuel and building materials. From 1992 to 2010, it was also used for passenger services to the biennial ILA Berlin Air Show. The new continuous line to the airport went into operation in October 2011. Because of the delays in opening the airport, it has no significant traffic so far, apart from the freight traffic to Schönefeld airport. == History== The construction of the Henschel aircraft factory near the town of Diepensee, south of Berlin, began in 1934. The so- called Henschelbahn (Henschel Railway) initially supplied the works. It had emerged from the Diepensee freight railway, which had originally operated as a horse tramway. The line ran from Berlin-Grünau station straight through the built-up area of Bohnsdorf. After the Second World War, the railway was dismantled for reparations. A Soviet military airport was built on the grounds of the Henschel works after 1945. The Henschel Railway was rebuilt in 1947 to supply it with materials and fuels. The southern part of the airport was transferred for civilian use to Deutsche Lufthansa of East Germany (later Interflug) on 27 April 1955. Initially, the former Henschel Railway continued to be used for the supply of materials and fuels. This line proved not to have sufficient capacity with the growth of the airport and it was also severely hampered the increasing road traffic. As a result a new siding was built in 1959 from the Grünbergallee station on the Berlin Outer Freight Ring (Güteraußenring, GAR) and the old line was closed. By the beginning of the 1960s, it became apparent that this line could no longer be used in the longer term. On the one hand, the line crossed the freeway that was under construction to the airport, on the other hand, the route of the GAR was needed for the future S-Bahn to Schönefeld. First, a track was laid parallel to the GAR, but due to the A 113 autobahn, which was under construction there, it could not be used in the longer-term. === The freight line to Schönefeld Airport=== Freight link to the airport. Because of these problems a completely new connection was built to the airport, which went into operation on 3 September 1963. It branched in Berlin-Grünau station from the Berlin–Görlitz railway, initially running parallel to it, then it turned to run south of Bohnsdorf through the forest and reached the airport from the east. Demands from Deutsche Lufthansa for services to carry its employees over the line were rejected due to the expected low traffic and lack of signalling infrastructure. In the 1970s and 1980s, the line, popularly called the Ölbahn (oil railway), was upgraded to enable the operation of axle loads of up to 22.5 tons. This enabled building materials to be carried on block trains to the Kienberg building materials warehouse, which was located next to the line. After German reunification, the ILA Berlin Air Show (ILA) took place for the first time on the southern part of the airport. To handle the number of visitors, shuttle trains ran hourly from Berlin-Lichtenberg via Schöneweide or from Schönefeld Airport station to Berlin-Schönefeld Airport South station, meaning that two trains an hour and direction ran over the industrial railway. Services were operated as seven-carriage double-decker push–pull trains that were hauled by class 232 locomotives. A temporary chipboard platform was built for passengers. In addition, signalling and control systems from Siemens were installed for passenger traffic at the previously unprotected level crossings. Previously, only the federal route 179 level crossing was protected with a semi-barrier system. Shuttle trains were again used at the following aerospace exhibitions, which took place every two years, with the rolling stock used changing over time. In 1994, for example, trains were operated with class 229 locomotives at both ends, alternately from Lichtenberg via Schöneweide and from Zoologischer Garten station via the Berlin Stadtbahn to the ILA station. In 2010, the last time the shuttle trains ran to ILA, they ran directly from Berlin-Lichtenberg without additional stops. Since 2012, the ILA is no longer held in Diepensee, but at Selchow on the west side of the airport grounds, so the shuttle trains have been cancelled. === Planning the connection of the new airport === Rail connections to the new airport: long-distance line running from west to east, S-Bahn line running on a bend from the north and freight link on the east side of the airport to the north of the main line. Regrowth on the old line south of Bohnsdorf. Noise barriers in the forest on the connection curve towards Grünau After lengthy discussions in the 1990s, the federal government and the state governments of Brandenburg and Berlin decided on the location of Berlin's new airport (then Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg International, abbreviated BBI) in the municipality of Schönefeld, south of the existing airport, partly using the old airport’s facilities. It was soon determined that the new terminal would be location the area south of the runways of the existing airport. As part of the Pilzkonzept (mushroom concept) it proved to be sensible to build lines connecting to Berlin's inner city via the North–South mainline, on the one hand, and via the Dresden Railway, on the other hand. Plans from the mid-1990s already showed a long-distance line, which was close to the route later built, while the S-Bahn was intended at that time to use a short underground route from the old Berlin Schönefeld Airport station. In addition to the connections with an S-Bahn line and a long-distance line that were actually built, a number of other options for the development of rail transport at the airport were discussed, which were not realised: * An extension of U-Bahn line 7 from Rudow via the old Berlin Schönefeld airport station to the new terminal was discussed. * An extension of the planned Transrapid Hamburg–Berlin line to the airport was also under discussion. Officially, the Berlin Senate did not abandon these plans until 2000. * There were demands, including from some of the Berlin Greens, to dispense with a direct connection to the terminal and instead to use the old Schönefeld station. A shuttle or a people mover would then convey passengers to the new terminal. === Construction and commissioning === The railway connection was initially planned as part of the \\"rail transport connection\\" in the application for planning approval for the airport as a whole. The Brandenburg transport ministry granted planning approval in August 2004 and the Federal Administrative Court confirmed it on 16 March 2006. Work began on the shell of the underground airport station in September 2007, on the S-Bahn line at the end of 2007 and on the western long-distance rail connection in the spring of 2008. The planning approval process for the eastern connection to the Görlitz Railway was delayed due to changes to the plan. Originally an upgrade of the existing line was planned, which could not be built because of the tight curve radii and the noise pollution for the residents, among other things. The planning approval process only started in 2007. Among several options tested, one involved building a line through the forest, running about 250 metres south of the old line. There were a number of protests by local residents and conservationists against its construction, partly because 14 hectares of forest had to be cleared. Due to the delays, there were fears that the eastern connection would not be completed by the planned opening of the airport in 2011, so alternative connection concepts were considered. Proposals of an environmental group to build a line along federal road 113, instead of the line through the Bohnsdorf forest, was declined by the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt, EBA). The EBA pointed out that there would be higher burdens for Bohnsdorf residents due to noise and vibration. On 19 February 2010, the EBA gave planning approval and a few days later, Deutsche Bahn began construction. It was agreed that the course of the old line would be restored to nature and noise barriers would be built on the new line. For the originally planned opening date of the new airport (now abbreviated as BER) on 30 October 2011, the eastern connection would be completed together with the western connection, the S-Bahn line and the Berlin Brandenburg airport station. However, the opening of the airport had meanwhile been postponed to 3 June 2012. It was not until the beginning of May 2012 that it officially announced that the opening of the BER airport would be delayed for the first time. Initially, completion was officially expected in 2013. As a result, the opening of the line also had to be delayed. At the beginning of 2018, the airport was expected to open in 2020 or 2021. Thus, there is no significant use of the completed line to the airport, apart from the freight traffic from the Görlitz Railway to the airport. DB operates several empty trains each day over the S-Bahn and the mainline tracks to reduce rusting of the tracks and to help ventilate the airport station. === Costs === In the financial agreement signed on 5 September 2006 by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg, the federal government and the Berlin Airports agreed to provide €636 million for rail connections (including the S-Bahn line). The federal government was to fund €576 million of this. The states of Berlin and Brandenburg were to fund €30 million each and undertook to fund transport services under contract for 20 years on the basis of full cost recovery. Under a fixed-price agreement, the airport company was required to fund the construction of the external structures of the tunnel and the airport station. Even after the completion of the rail link, the official construction cost was €636 million. Deutsche Bahn estimates that the trips required to ventilate the tunnel since the completion of the line cost €2 million a month. === Planned passenger services=== Airport forecourt with access buildings to the platforms, with the terminal in the background. The first plans in the mid-1990s included as an airport connection for regional services, an InterRegio service from Kiel via Berlin and the airport line to Görlitz. In the mid-2000s, the Berlin Senate planned that all ICE and IC trains starting or ending in Berlin would be routed to and from the airport station and an InterCity line would run from Berlin to the airport towards Cottbus and continue to Poland. However, these plans were not pursued further. At the beginning of 2012, prior to the planned opening of the BER, it was planned that the three RE/RB lines that run to the old Schoenefeld Airport station would instead run to the new airport station. These were the RE 7 (Dessau – Berlin – Wünsdorf-Waldstadt), RB 14 (Nauen – Berlin – Senftenberg) and RB 22 (Potsdam – Airport (− Königs Wusterhausen)) services. In addition, a new RE 9 line was to connect the airport via the Outer Ring and the Berlin–Halle railway (Anhalter Bahn) to Berlin Hauptbahnhof. A direct fast connection to the city centre of Berlin was not possible because the construction of long- distance tracks on the Dresden Railway in Berlin has been delayed. In addition, a few long-distance services would be extended to the airport. With the completion of the Dresden Railway, instead of the current RE 9 service, an unsubsidised airport express service would connect the airport station with the city centre every 15 minutes and some other services would also run over this route. === Future plans === A new halt is planned to the east of the intersection of the line with the A113 on the route of a newly planned road. It would consist of two side platforms and two associated station forecourts and serve regional traffic. The construction of the new road is scheduled for 2019. == Route== Line to the airport after the underpass under the Berlin outer ring. The Dresden railway crosses the Berlin outer ring in the area of Glasower Damm in the town of Mahlow. It is connected from the south to the Berlin outer ring via two connecting curves. The outer ring was upgraded to four tracks from the Glasower Damm Ost junction towards Schönefeld Airport in the 1980s. The new line to Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) first uses the former northern pair of tracks of the outer ring. Less than two kilometres further east, the line then runs under the other tracks of the outer ring and turns towards the southeast. A short Selchow West junction–Selchow Süd junction link connects the southern tracks of the outer ring to the line to BER. This runs first above ground in a trough. North of the village of Selchow, it meets the Grünau Cross–Berlin Brandenburg Airport railway of the S-Bahn coming from the northeast. Both routes run parallel from the western edge of the airport area in a several kilometre-long tunnel between the two runways. The Berlin Brandenburg Airport station is located shortly before the eastern end of the tunnel. The S-Bahn line ends in the station and the main line continues northeast and leaves the tunnel. The fast tracks for regional trains ending in the station are already above ground. A short distance later, at Diepensee Cargo junction, the line meets the freight link from the airport, which was previously served by the original line. The new line converges with the route of the old line a short distance later in the area of the Kienberg loading point. The line passes under the A 113 autobahn to the east of the settlement of Hubertus. Both lines then run through a forest area in the locality of Berlin-Bohnsdorf; the new line runs about 250 metres south of the old line. Southeast of Bohnsdorf, the new line divides at Bohnsdorf West junction into two 1.4 km and 1.8 km-long single track sections, which run to the Görlitz Railway to the south and north, forming a railway triangle. === Chainage=== The through line (VzG line number 6151) begins at Glasower Damm Ost junction. However, running distance on the line (chainage) does not start at zero, but follows that of the Berlin outer ring. This in turn continues the chainage of the Michendorf–Großbeeren railway, opened in 1926, which formed part of the Brandenburg Bypass Railway. The starting point of the chainage is therefore at kilometre 28.220 km, the distance from Michendorf. The outer ring to the east and the line to the new airport have parallel chainages measured from that point. The end of line 6151 is at Bohnsdorf Süd junction on the Görlitz Railway at kilometre 42.073. The old Berlin-Grünau – Berlin Schönefeld Airport South railway had the VzG line number of 6119, which is still used today for the remaining part of the Diepensee Cargo junction – Berlin- Schönefeld Airport South line. Similarly, the northern connecting curve built parallel to the old line from the Görlitz Railway from Berlin to Bohnsdorf West junction bears this number. The running distances on these sections are measured from Berlin-Grünau station. The zero point of the old line is in the southern part of the station at kilometre 13.43 of the Görlitz Railway. The section to Berlin-Schönefeld Airport South maintains this chainage. The new connecting curve from Berlin-Grünau to Bohnsdorf West is measured with the new chainage. It starts at kilometre 14.4 of the Görlitz Railway and is 1.8 kilometres long. The 0.79 km-long Selchow West–Selchow Süd connecting curve (line 6186) lies south of the tracks of the outer ring. === Operating points=== On the left is the line to the airport and on the right is the outer ring towards Schönefeld. Looking from the east at part of the airport station with the tunnel entrance. Diepensee Cargo junction. In the foreground is the freight line to the airport and in the background is the line to the passenger station.  Glasower Damm Ost  In the area of the Glasower Damm, a connecting road was built between Mahlow and Glasow, crossing the Berlin–Dresden railway and the Berlin outer ring at the beginning of the 1950s. Three junctions were built to connect the lines: Glasower Damm West on the Berlin outer ring as a junction from the connecting curve from the west to the Dresden Railway in the south, Glasower Damm Süd (south) on the Dresden Railway at the meeting of two connecting from the Berlin outer ring and Glasower Damm Ost (east) on the outer ring at the connecting curve from the east to the Dresden Railway. In the area of this junction, a curve was built from the junction to the new line to the new airport in the opposite direction to the existing connection.  Selchow West and Süd  Selchow West and South are junctions on the short connecting curve from the southern track of the Berlin outer ring towards BER airport.  Berlin Airport station The underground station is only for passenger traffic. It consists of two island platforms for the long-distance railway and one for the S-Bahn.  Diepensee Cargo  This is the junction to the new airport freight terminal.  Berlin Schönefeld Flughafen Süd  The terminus of the old line from Grünau is used to supply the airport with fuel and building materials. It is now connected to the new line. Over time, it has changed its name several times, mostly following the renaming of the airport and the passenger station that was located north of the airport. It was called Diepensee before the construction of the line from Grünau. Its name in the 1960s and 1970s was Zentralflughafen Süd (Central Airport South) and then Flughafen Süd (Airport South). Since the 1990s, it has been called Berlin-Schönefeld Flughafen Süd (Berlin Schönefeld Airport South). It has always been categorised as a Ladestelle (loading point).Various maps of the Reichsbahndirektion Berlin (Deutsche Reichsbahn railway division in Berlin).  Kienberg  A loading point for building material transports had already been established in Kienberg on the old line.  Bohnsdorf West and Süd  The line divides into two branches at Bohnsdorf West junction. One runs southeast to the Görlitz Railway, which it joins at Bohnsdorf Süd junction, the other runs north towards Berlin-Grünau station. ==NotesFootnotes=Sources= External links == * * * Category:Railway lines in Berlin Category:Railway lines in Brandenburg Category:Airport rail links in Germany ","title":"Glasower Damm Ost–Bohnsdorf Süd railway"},{"id":"56784709","text":"Gladice Georgina Keevil or Gladice G. Rickford (1884 - 1959) was a British suffragette who served as head of the Midlands office of the Women's Social and Political Union between 1908 and 1910. == Early life == Gladice was born and had her childhood at Clitterhouse Farm in Cricklewood. She was educated at the Cricklewood Kindergarten (where she won a prize for clay modelling in 1891) and Cricklewood High School, the Frances Buss School in Camden, and the Lambeth School of Art. She worked as a governess in France and the USA before returning to Britain in 1907. She married in 1913, becoming Mrs. Rickford. == Involvement in the Women's Suffrage Movement == After joining the WSPU in September 1907, Gladice was employed as the head of the Midlands as a National Organiser in 1908. She opened a WSPU Midlands headquarters in Birmingham where she worked with Bertha Ryland (daughter of Mrs. Alice Ryland) and Laura Aimsworth. She was campaigning at the Bury St Edmunds by-election (1907) with Rachel Barratt, Nellie Martel, Emmeline Pankhurst, Aeta Lamb and Elsa Gye, organised the campaign during the Wolverhampton by-election in 1908. She was a key speaker at demonstrations in support of women's suffrage in Heaton Park (July 1908) Hyde Park (1908) and Belfast (1910). == Arrest in 1908 == Gladice was one of twelve women who was arrested after walking single file through the streets towards the houses of commons with Mrs. Pankhurst in February 1908 \\"to present a petition from the Conference at Caxton Hall, and to the refusal of the authorities to treat suffragist offenders as first-class misdemeanants.\\" Gladice was arrested along with Mrs Pankhurst and others and was charged with resisting and obstructing the police. ==Recognition== Keevil being honoured in 1910 In 1910 Keevil was invited to stay at Eagle House in Bathampton, Somerset where a tree was planted in her honour. Many significant women from the suffragette movement were invited to stay at Mary Blathwayt's parents' home and to plant a tree to recover from and celebrate a prison sentence. The trees were known as \\"Annie's Arboreatum\\" after Annie Kenney. Gladice was invited to Eagle House several times. Mary's mother thought her one of the nicer suffragettes. The Blathwayt's fell out with the movement when politician's were assaulted. The WSPU movement split over the authority demanded by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst and their increasing demands for extremism. and Keevil is thought to have left in about 1911. Keevil married in 1913 and went to live in Burpham in the 1940s where she brought up three sons.

Taylour (born c.1827 - died 1905) was a Scottish suffragist and women's movement campaigner, and one of the first women to give lectures in public. She travelled around Scotland and northern England as a suffrage lecturer, and was a key figure in spreading the message of the women's suffrage throughout Scotland. == Life == Taylour was born in 1827 or 1828, in Stranraer, Scotland, to Maria Angus and Nathaniel Taylor. She lived in Balfour. In 1861 she moved to Saffron Walden in Essex, where in 1901 she was recorded as living with Rachel P. Robson. Taylour died Saffron Walden on 25 February 1905. She was interred in the Society of Friends' burial ground. == Campaigning for women's suffrage == Jane Taylour addressed gave public lectures and lecture tours on women's suffrage in London, the North-East of England and in Scotland. She sent in a petition in favour of Jacob Bright's Bill to remove women's electoral disabilities. She was described by women's rights activist Clementia Taylor as \\"the energetic little woman from Stranraer\\". In 1869 Clementia Taylor asked Taylour to undertake a lecture tour, and from 1870 she gave public lectures throughout Scotland and Northeast England campaigning for women's equality and suffrage. She was accompanied on some of her lecture tours in Scotland by fellow campaigners Mary Hill Burton and Agnes McLaren. McLaren and Taylour travelled to the north of Scotland because \\"everything that could be done in Edinburgh had been done\\", as members of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage and county members had voted and petitioned, and the Town Council had petitioned in favour of votes for women. The meetings were popular, and in some cases people had to be turned away, and Taylour's lectures were given extensive media coverage; The Orkney Herald gave her lectures in Orkney full coverage and reproduced her speeches in full, and her speech in Lerwick in Shetland on 12 September 1873 was fully reported in The Shetland Times. The Women's Suffrage Journal commented about one of her lectures that \\"Miss Taylour has all the requisites of a public lecturer. Her composition is chaste and elegant, her voice distinct and agreeable, and her manner attractive and graceful\\". Taylour delivered a number of lectures in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. On 12 March 1885 she was one of several speakers at the Temperance Hall, along with Florence Balgarnie, Jessie Tod, and Ann Radford McCormick. She returned two years later on 18 January 1887 to give a lecture on allowing women greater political and social equality with men, and returned to Gainsborough again on 31 May 1885 on women and politics at the Methodist Mutual Improvement Association. By 1873 she had delivered over 150 lectures in Scotland. Women's suffrage committees were formed in Tain, Dingwall, Forres, Elgin, Banff, Invergordon, Nairn and Dunkeld as a result of Taylour and McLaren's campaigns in these towns. Taylour was the First Honorary Secretary of the Galloway branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage from 1870 to 1872. She was joint Secretary of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage, one of the first three suffrage societies to be formed in Britain, with Agnes McLaren from 1873-1876, and an executive member of the central committee of the national Society. In 1901 she was a vice-president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In Saffron Walden, in 1895, she was Secretary of the local branch of the British Women's Temperance Association, and was influential in getting women appointed to the local Board of Guardians. == See also == * Suffragette * Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom == References == Category:1905 deaths Category:1827 births Category:Scottish suffragists ","title":"Jane Taylour"},{"id":"56784727","text":"Naheed Begum is a Pakistani politician who had been a Member of the Provincial Assembly of Sindh, from 2008 to May 2018. ==Early life and education== She was born on 15 November 1975 in Sukkur.

Despite growing up in poverty, she used her passion to finish her undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the Africa Nazarene University and attain her PhD at University of Cape Town. She is known for inventing M-Ganga and Ummeli, mobile applications for promoting health and medicine and matching unemployed workers with employment opportunities. Gitau was the first African to win the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship received in the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing based on her inventions and thesis. She contributes and manages the Technology Innovations for Inclusive Growth program where she is presently employed in the Africa Development Bank (AfDB). ==Early life== Gitau was born to a working-class family in Mathare. Soon after her birth, her family lost their property in Mathare in the aftermath of the 1982 Kenyan Coup D'état Attempt and were forced to settle with relatives in Nakuru. During her childhood in Nakuru, Gitau saw her first collegiate graduation ceremony on television. She credits witnessing a woman receive a PhD from then-president Daniel arap Moi during this broadcast with motivating her to pursue higher education. Gitau completed her undergraduate studies at the Africa Nazarene University (ANU) in Nairobi. Her career at ANU was marked by academic excellence: she remained on the Honor Roll and Dean's List during all four years of her education, and earned the university's Merit and Leadership Awards in 2003 and 2005, respectively. After receiving her degree, she worked briefly as a UNICEF volunteer before taking a job as a programs assistant at the Centre for Multiparty Democracy, a Kenyan political activism group. She worked there until 2007, when she enrolled in the University of Cape Town to pursue an MSc and subsequently a PhD in Computer Science. ==Career== Gitau has worked in a plethora of different areas to benefit African development. Her most notable career achievement is her mobile application \\"Ummeli\\". This application, created in June 2010, matches unemployed people with employers in need of their skills. Due to its low cost and practical use, its potential to change unemployment in labor markets is very high. Umelli is available in South Africa now and is projected to become available in other African countries. In December 2010, Gitau started working for Google Inc's Emerging Markets where she \\"identified, researched and designed the www.beba.co.keconcept and worked on its introduction to Kenya’s Transit system\\". In January 2011, Gitau was a co-founder and research mentor for iHub_Research where she was on the forefront of research on mobile internet usage in Africa and worked on the Microsoft oneApp project. Currently, Gitau works in the ICT department of the African Development Bank (AfDB) working on developing various projects with different governments across Africa. ==Awards and Recognitions== On July 31, 2013, Gitau became one of three people to win the ABIE Change Agent Award. She made history by becoming the first African to win the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship. She was recognized with fellow honorees in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 5 during the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC). In 2017, Gitau was recognized as the Most Influential Women CEO Global for East Africa under the Information and communications technology (ICT) sector by the Independent Magazine.https://www.independent.co.ug/ceo-awards-wangusa-e- africas-influential-woman-art-culture/2/ Other * 2005 Top Ten Finalists for Oxford Rhodes Memorial Scholarship * 2013 AfroElle Power List of African women who affect change * 2015 Top 40 under 40 women to watch in Kenya * 2015 ASPEN New Voices Fellow ==References== Category:University of Cape Town alumni Category:Kenyan computer scientists Category:Kenyan women computer scientists Category:Africa Nazarene University alumni Category:Living people Category:1980s births Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Shikoh Gitau"},{"id":"56784765","text":"Nusrat Bano Sehar Abbasi is a Pakistani politician who is a Member of the Provincial Assembly of Sindh, from 2008. ==Early life and education== She was born on 29 January 1969 in Rohri.

She holds the title of honorary professor of Hebrew Bible at the University of St. Andrews School of Divinity. Before her current appointment, she has worked from 1998 to 2008 as professor of Hebrew Bible at the Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, California. After that, she was Professor of Hebrew Bible / Old Testament at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, UK, where she also served as Dean of Arts and Divinity from 2013 to 2015. De Troyer is co-editor of the international Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht academic publication series for Septuagint research, De Septuaginta Investigationes.. She is also editor in chief, together with Geert Van Oyen, of the series Contributions to Biblical Exegesis and Theology, published by Peeters in Louvain, Deuterocanonical and Cognate Studies, published by de Gruyter, in Berlin. Together with Friedrich Reiterer and in collaboration with Reinhard Feldmeier she edits the journal Biblische Notizen / Biblical Notes. She is also a member of the editorial boards of the academic journals Textus, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament and Journal of Ancient Judaism. From 2014 to 2019 De Troyer serves as a member of the scientific advisory board for the Finnish Academy's Centre of Excellence Changes in Sacred Texts and Traditions. Since 2019 she is a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. == Research == Kristin De Troyer's research focuses on the Septuagint and the textual history of the Hebrew Bible. Her publications deal especially with the various Hebrew and Greek versions of the Book of Joshua and the Book of Esther. A central conclusion in De Troyer's research is that the processes of rewriting are similar between biblical textual witnesses and those early Jewish texts that were not included in the biblical canon. She has, for example, demonstrated that the initial Septuagint translation, the Old Greek text, of Josh 10 was translated from an earlier Hebrew source text than the Masoretic Text, which is used in most modern editions of the Hebrew Bible. According to her, the Masoretic Text reflects later redactional reworking of this shorter Hebrew source text. De Troyer has edited for publication two 2nd century CE Greek papyri from the Schøyen Collection: MS 2648 containing Josh 9:27-11:2 and MS 2649 containing parts of Leviticus. MS 2648 is the earliest extant Septuagint Joshua manuscript and preserves a text predating the Hexaplaric revision of Origen and is considered a witness to the Old Greek text. == Books == * The Ultimate and the Penultimate Text of the Book of Joshua.\\" Louvain: Peeters, 2018.() * Die Septuaginta und die Endgestalt des Alten Testaments.

United in Major League Soccer. ==Club careerEarly career=== Mora made his senior debut with Belén in Costa Rica, at the end of the 2011 Invierno. He finished the year with 15 appearances, including a run of 11 starts in the Verano tournament. After the season, Mora moved to C.S. Uruguay, who were promoted from the second division. He made 10 appearances in the Invierno as Uruguay finished three points from qualifying for the second stage, but made just one appearance in the Verano and returned to Belén after the season. The 2013–14 season would be his best with Belén, as he made 34 appearances with the club, including 21 out of 22 in the Invierno. ===Saprissa=== In advance of the 2015 Verano, Mora was signed by Costa Rican giants Deportivo Saprissa, who were just coming off a tournament victory in the Invierno. Mora made his debut on March 2 against UCR, and would go on to make 4 appearances in the league that season with Saprissa. He also tallied his first CONCACAF Champions League appearance, coming off the bench against Mexican side Club América at the Estadio Azteca. Saprissa qualified for the second stage by finishing first in the Verano, but lost to Alajuelense in a reversal of the events which occurred in the Invierno. After the season, Mora was invited to train with Polish club Legia Warsaw, but he remained with Saprissa. Mora was unused by Saprissa the following season until December while he was away with Costa Rica's olympic qualifying team. He appeared in the club's final two games of the season, and following the suspension center-back Andrés Imperiale due to yellow card accumulation, Mora was given an opportunity to start in the second leg of the semifinal against Herediano. Saprissa lost 2–0, but advanced to the final against Alajuelense. Mora came off the bench in the first leg to replace Imperiale, and Saprissa would go on to win their 32nd league title. An injury early in the following campaign to regular left-back Francisco Calvo opened the door for Mora, and he was given a run of 7 starts by manager Carlos Watson, who was his former manager at Uruguay. Mora was given one more start the rest of the season, but an injury to Calvo allowed Mora to appear in the second stage against Alajuelense. However, Mora picked up his fifth yellow card of the season in the first leg, and was suspended for the second leg as Saprissa bowed out of the competition. Mora appeared in 11 games in the 2016 Invierno, and appeared 4 times in the first season of the league's new format, the quadrangular, which Saprissa won. As regular season champions, Saprissa did not have to play in a two-legged final, and directly won their 33rd league title. Mora also appeared in two of La S's group stage matches in the CONCACAF Champions League, as Saprissa advanced past Portland Timbers of MLS and C.D. Dragón of El Salvador. Following Calvo's departure to Minnesota United, Mora began the 2017 Verano as Saprissa's left-back. He picked up an injury on February 5 against Alajuelense, but he returned to fitness in time to face CF Pachuca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League on February 22. The first leg finished 0–0, although Saprissa had a claim for a penalty when Mora was taken down in the area by Érick Aguirre Mora would miss the quarterfinal due to injury, and ended up missing the next five league matches before returning on March 24 against UCR. Mora finished with 14 appearances in the first stage, which Saprissa won, and started the first five matches of the quadrangular, picking up an injury against Herediano. He recovered in time for the second leg of the final against Herediano, but was substituted off as Saprissa lost 5–0 on aggregate.

It is claimed by Energica to be the world's first street-legal electric Italian sport motorcycle. The prototype was finished in 2013 and the vehicle came into the market in 2015. The prototype made use of new technologies such as CNC and 3D-printing, including the dashboard and headlights which were 3D-printed. ==Design== The Ego is an all-electric motorcycle. It has a 107 kW motor with 200 N⋅m of torque (at low RPM) giving it a top speed of 240 km/h. The motor is powered by an 11.7 kW⋅h battery. The Ego weighs approximately 258–280 kg, contributed to by the heavy battery. It has four-level adjustable engine braking, which is also regenerative. The motor is situated near the cast aluminium swing-arm and side-mounted mono shock. Projector headlamps are used for headlights. The dashboard is a 109.22 mm TFT display. Before 2017, it had a 136 hp electric motor with 180 Nm torque. However, the naked sibling 'Eva' produces 108 hp which was 95 hp before 2017. They are also EURO IV compliant after 2017. The price was also reduced to approximately £20,000. The bike has a tubular steel trellis frame partly visible despite the fairings. Upgraded again in 2019, they are equipped with an electric throttle that can read adjustments down to tenths of mrad. Other electronic features such as \\"silent charging\\" and heated hand grips were also added. ==Performance== The Ego reaches 0–100 km/h in 3 seconds. It has 43 mm Marzocchi suspension in front along with parking assist and Brembo brakes with features such as ABS and anti-rollover systems. According to some reviewers, the suspension is relatively softly calibrated. It has a controller named a \\"VCU\\" by Energica, similar to an ESC. It is claimed to be controlling all aspects - from battery to engine (including engine braking) by Energica. The EGO has a range of approximately 160 km under normal use (190 km in \\"eco\\" mode).. The battery can be recharged to 85% in 30 minutes at fast charging station (mode 4, DC fast charge), or 100% in 3 and half hours (mode 2 or 3, 220 V). However, it takes 8 hours to full charge on standard US power supply of 110 V. The battery life is 1200 cycles at 80% capacity. ==Production== The first prototype was finished by Energica in 2013, and the vehicle went into production later with sales starting from 2015. According to Top Speed, currently it is facing \\"Inventory shortage\\" as the production is less than demand. ==MotoGP== An electric motorcycle class (MotoE) was added to MotoGP in 2019. It is a single make class, unlike races between different manufacturers. A performance oriented model Ego Corsa is used for MotoE. ===Ego Corsa=== It is the race track variant of the Ego with Michelin tires and performance tweaks. According to Energica, its motor produces 120 kW (previously 110 kW) continuous power and 200 Nm torque, reaching a top speed of 168 mph (previously 155 mph). Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph is less than 2.8 seconds. According to Top speed, the race track Ego will have a top speed of 175 mph. The battery is 20 kWh lithium ion, lighter and more compact than standard Ego. The power output is comparable to the Moto2 class; however, due to the heavier weight of the bikes because of the batteries, the power-to-weight ratio is comparatively closer to the Moto3 class (single-cylinder 250 cc). Of the four circuits used so far, only the hilly Red Bull Ring has resulted in quicker laptimes than the Moto3 class, with the electric bikes typically being 1–1.5 seconds per lap slower.

Winter was born in Amsterdam as the oldest child of the wealthy merchant Pieter van Winter who received visitors to his art gallery that he had installed at the rear of his house Saxenburg, Keizersgracht 244. He had purchased the house for the astronomical sum of Dfl. 100,000 from Jean de Neufville. In 1800 her mother died and in 1807 her father died, leaving the collection as it then was in the family home, the portraits of which became the property of Lucretia's brother. The rest of the paintings were to be divided between Lucretia and her younger sister Anna Louisa, who would later amass her own art collection. After her brother's marriage Lucretia bought the house Herengracht 440 in 1809.Lucretia Johanna van Winter in 1001 Vrouwen Her father's art gallery remained available for viewing at her parents’ home (now her brother's residence) and were to be split after the youngest sister Anna Louisa came of age. Anna Louisa took her portion of the collection when she married jonkheer Willem van Loon in 1815, but Lucretia had already made her first art purchases since 1810 with a view to forming her own art gallery and united her half of her father's collection with this modest collection of her own. She continued collecting in her own name until 1820, purchasing in total 71 paintings on her own. In 1822 at the age of 37 Lucretia married Hendrik Six van Hillegom (1790-1847) and the couple moved into his house at Herengracht 509-511. After that all art purchases were made in his name, but it is assumed that she remained an avid collector since there are no records of him making art purchases before his marriage. Among the most notable of the paintings Lucretia bought herself are Vermeer's Milkmaid and The Little Street. After the death of Lucretia the collection went to her husband and on his death in 1847 it fell to their sons. In 1877 the heirs of Anna Louisa sold the Van Loon-Winter collection as a block to the Paris Rothschild family, which caused a stir in the Dutch papers (it included the Pendant portraits of Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit, among others). When Lucretia's children died her grandchildren also expected to sell the collection, but a large portion was acquired by the Rijksmuseum amidst debates about the value.

The camp was assigned an SS garrison consisting of about one hundred SS guards and female staff. The commander of the camp was SS-Obersturmführer Josef Leipold. From the very beginning, Schindler told the SS his factory would not operate as a typical camp, forbade guards to punish or harass the camp inmates, and barred any SS member from entering the operational part of the factory.Snyder, T. \\"Encyclopedia of the Third Reich\\", Wordsworth Editions Ltd (1998) ==History== Brünnlitz labor camp was created in the fall of 1944, after Oskar Schindler learned that his work force of over one thousand Jews were to be killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau. A large segment of Schindler's labor force were in fact unskilled workers, which Schindler had been protecting under the guise of essential labor, and Schindler knew they would not stand up to scrutiny at Auschwitz and would be exterminated per Nazi policy. Using the last of his considerable black market wealth, Schindler bribed SS and Nazi officials to transfer his entire workforce from his factory in Kraków to the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The transport list, the famous \\"Schindler's List\\", was created through bribery with the SS charging a fee for each worker Schindler took with him to Brünnlitz. The \\"concentration camp\\" at Brünnlitz was simply a factory complex, with an attached barracks for the workers, and no real external security to speak of. A token front gate and a perimeter fence were all the camp had in ways of preventing escape, however every Jew at the complex was grateful to be there and hoped to survive the war under Schindler's protection. The SS at the camp were left with little to do, to which Schindler took advantage by supplying alcohol and good food, in order to keep the SS away from his workers. Between November 1944 and January 1945, the Brünnlitz labor camp was visited several times by former Płaszów commandant Amon Göth, who considered himself a friend to Schindler. The inmates at Brünnlitz, many of whom had suffered harshly under Göth, remarked that he was a physically changed man and looked feeble and pathetic compared to his early tenure when he was a figure who commanded absolute fear and terror.Crowe, David, Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of His Life, Wartime Activities, and the True Story Behind the List, Westview Press (2004) Oskar Schindler went bankrupt keeping his factory running, mainly due to bribes to the SS and the purchase of armaments from other facilities, so that his factory would not contribute to the war effort and thus, in Schindler's mind, hasten its end. The Red Army liberated Brünnlitz on May 9, 1945. A few days prior, the SS guards had deserted and Schindler had escaped to American lines with the help of his Jewish workers, having been given a letter written by his workers attesting to his rescue activities. As of October 2016, and the Endowment Fund for the Memorial of the Shoah and Oskar Schindler has purchased the site where the camp was located and plans to convert it into a museum. ===Timeline=== The ruins of the factory in 2004. *1840s: The Low-Beer Jewish family moved into the area.

The ancient village was inhabited through four stages each defined by distinctly different types of pottery. The site was excavated between 1957 and 1959 over two seasons. Both the village and the site are located roughly a mile south of the modern day town of Maheshwar. == Archaeology == Ceramic goblet from Navdatoli, Malwa, 1300 BCE; Malwa culture The archaeological site was defined by 4 distinct mounds and excavated by researchers from Deccan College. Mounds I, II, and III were partially excavated in 1957-1958. Mound IV was completely excavated over two seasons between 1957 and 1959. Numerous rectangular and circular structures were uncovered and these contained most of the artifacts that were found. The houses mostly consisted of a single room and were made of wattle and daub. Lime was used on the floors and walls in an effort to prevent insects from entering the living space. The wattle of the houses were made of either acacia or conifer and were interwoven with bamboo. Most houses had a fireplace and a stone slab that was used for grinding and mashing grain. Pottery of varying styles including Malwa, Jorwe, Black and Red Ware, Cream-Slipped Ware, and Grey-Ware were also commonly found within the houses . Similarities between Navdatoli pottery and certain Iranian ceramics have led some to believe the area was colonized by immigrants from the Northwest. Given the size and number of residences found, along with the length of time the area was occupied, it is estimated that on average roughly 150 individuals lived in the village in its earliest stage. Evidence of domestic animals including Indian cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs were also found. == Lithic Production == Throughout the roughly 20,000 square feet of area that was excavated, over 30,000 blades, cores, and flakes were found, leading archaeologists to believe the site was a production area for lithic tools. Nearly all of the tools were made of chalcedony from the nearby Narmada River. The same method of production was used throughout the occupation of the site and it appears that each household was responsible for making their own tools, often the case for contemporary sites. Blades found at Navdatoli were often longer than those found at other sites within the same time period. ==See also== *Inamgaon ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Madhya Pradesh Category:Chalcolithic sites of Asia ","title":"Navdatoli"},{"id":"56785300","text":"Francille Rusan Wilson (born March 7, 1947) is an American historian, best known for her research on black labor, social movements and black women's history. == Early life and education == Francille Rusan Wilson attended both segregated and desegregated schools in St. Louis County, Missouri.

He is best known for his brief association with Henry Morgan. ==History== Witherborn initially sailed with Henry Morgan's fleet in attacks against Spanish cities in Central America. He was part of Morgan's flotilla during their 1670 assault on Panama along with a number of other prominent buccaneers. By 1671 new Jamaican Governor Thomas Lynch moved to curtail privateering against the Spanish, offering pardons to privateers who surrendered and hunting down those who refused. After parting with Morgan, Witherborn took command of the barque Charity, formerly commanded by Dutch corsair David Marten. Witherborn sailed with Dutch pirate Jelles de Lecat (\\"Captain Yhallahs\\") for a time before partnering with French captain Dumangle—also a veteran of Morgan's campaigns—and his ship Le Diable Volant (Flying Devil). The two signed articles of agreement confirming their intention to go privateering together. They raided Spanish shipping and attacked towns on the Cuban coast through 1671, committing \\"great violence against the Spaniards\\". In early 1672 Lynch sent Major William Beeston (who would later succeed Lynch as Governor) in HMS Assistance to hunt down the remaining rogue privateers. Aided by former buccaneer John Morrice, Beeston chased Lecat (who had entered into Spanish service) but could not catch him. Instead he captured Witherborn and Dumangle. They were imprisoned, tried, and convicted. Witherborn protested that his first mate held the real power, and that Articles he signed with Dumangle were just a ruse, but Lynch, Beeston, and the other judges were not swayed: \\"Upon consideration of the whole matter all were of opinion that having committed piracy and broken the articles of peace, Captain Witherborn ought to suffer death according to the law.\\" Jamaican officials balked at executing them; when the Spanish too refused to execute Dumangle, he was released for fear of reprisals from French pirates in Santo Domingo and Tortuga. Witherborn was sent back to England as a prisoner alongside Henry Morgan. While Morgan was pardoned and released, and eventually became a Lieutenant Governor, Witherborn was instead pressed into Royal Navy service. ==See also== * Jan Erasmus Reyning – Another Dutch buccaneer who sailed with Lecat and who also evaded Beeston. ==NotesReferences== Category:17th-century pirates Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:English privateers Category:English pirates Category:Caribbean pirates ","title":"Francis Witherborn"},{"id":"56785618","text":"Gowlan () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Gowlan is bounded on the west by Tullyveela, Derrynananta Upper and Derrynananta Lower townlands and on the east by Altcrock, Owencam and Tullynaconspod townlands. Its chief geographical features are Derrynananta Lough, forestry plantations, waterfalls, gravel pits and mountain streams. Gowlan is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 926 statute acres. The townland contains the following sub-divisions- Tullyrower (Tulaig Reamhair= The Stumpy Hill); Tullyuchtharach (Tulaig Uachtarach = The Upper Hill); Tullywan (Tulaig Bhán = The White Hill). ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.

Tithe Applotment Books 1826 The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- There is a large mountain stream through the centre of the townland. It generally overflows its banks in winter and floods the low parts of the townland during the winter months. The soil is consequently cold and light, yielding poor crops of oats & potatoes. There is no county cess levied, as the townland is considered as mountain. The Gowlan Valuation Office Field books are available for August 1839. In 1841 the population of the townland was 13, being 8 males and 5 females. There were two houses in the townland, both of which were inhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 9, being 7 males and 2 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were two houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists four landholders in the townland. \\\\- Griffith's Valuation In 1861 the population of the townland was 20, being 8 males and 12 females.

In 1898 Lockwood attracted regional attention when he led a party of four delegates to the First National Convention of the Social Democracy of America in a painted propaganda wagon — a journey of 2,000 miles from Tennessee to Chicago, the site of the convention.\\"2000 Miles by Team: Novel Ride of Delegates to the Social Democracy Session,\\" Chicago Daily Inter Ocean, June 12, 1898, pg. 29. During the journey Lockwood and his political associates stopped in towns along their route to lecture about socialism from the back of their wagon, with Lockwood selling pen-and-ink caricatures and greeting cards to raise funds for the journey. The brightly-decorated wagon was painted by Lockwood and he produced a series of cartoon placards to help illustrate the political oratory delivered by himself and A. S. Edwards, editor of the socialist weekly newspaper The Coming Nation, who was also a convention delegate. Lockwood saw the propaganda wagon as an important innovation — one which he would use with regularity over the next two decades — declaring to the press that > \\"We are socialists and we want to spread the doctrine of cooperation rather > than competition. We think we have found the way to convert the country, > because we can travel cheaply in a wagon and reach all classes.\\" Lockwood and his associates were advocates of the Social Democracy establishing a \\"wagon brigade\\" of similar propaganda vehicles to bring the new political party's message to small communities across the United States. ===Later years=== Cover art of Guy Lockwood's pamphlet, Unity.

She and her husband, Linley, a retired Colonel from the Indian Army lived at Eagle House in Somerset and established a welcome and garden summerhouse for women in the movement, that became known as the \\"Suffragette's Rest\\" . == Early life == Emily Marion Rose was born in about 1852. Her father was John Benson Coles Rose. She married her first cousin Colonel Linley Blathwayt in 1874 and they lived in India. Linley was an army officer and their first child John Linley was born in 1876. They returned to live in Sussex in 1877 after John died. They moved from there to Eagle House, Batheaston, on the outskirts of Bath in 1892 with their son William and daughter Mary. They had two children, the elder daughter Mary attended Bath High School and then was supported at home as she became an active member of the suffragette movement and the younger, son William, was an electrical engineer and English teacher in Germany until the start of the First World War. == Campaigning for women's suffrage == Both Emily and Mary became affiliated to the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Through a network of connections, people from the suffragette movement were invited to stay with Emily and her family to recover from a prison sentence or hunger strike and whilst there to plant a tree in the Eagle House garden to mark their suffering for this cause. Annie Kenney met Mary Blathwayt at a WPSU meeting in Bath and came to stay with the family, along with several other suffragettes who joined them for short periods over a number of years. The memorial trees planted (over 40 trees) became known as 'Annie's Arbour'. Suffragettes recuperated in the purpose built summer-house Emily's husband, Linley, created at Eagle House (suffragette's rest). Emily would take people on tours of the gardens and planted and showed flowers in the suffragette colours. Emily Blathwayt recorded in her diary which is in the public archives : > \\"Elsie Howey, Vera Wentworth and Mary Phillips were arrested at Exeter and > imprisoned for a week and it is said they are going through the hunger > strike as the 14 have done. The crowds were with them outside Lord > Carrington's meeting and all resisted police and two working men were > arrested. The women would not pay the fine.\\" == Resignation from the Women's Social and Political Union == Later in the campaign, other actions by Vera Wentworth and Elsie Howey (who had stayed with the Blathwayts) were considered violent towards the Prime Minister , leading to Emily herself resigning from the WSPU, and her husband Linley writing to them both to object to this approach and also complaining to Christabel Pankhurst at the violence arising in the movement. Despite their real concerns about the physical damage to property and the risk to hurting innocent people, the Blathwayts continued to support their daughter's activism and to welcome suffragette visitors and support the eventual achievement of votes for women. Personal activities and a uniquely private view of the suffragette movement from Emily's family perspective gives us an insight which adds depth to that usually in the public domain or the press of the time . == Death and legacy == Emily Blathwayt lived at Eagle House until her death in 1940. The archive of Emily's and Mary's personal diaries and the many photographs by Linley remain as an intimate record of the movement and its supporters . The trees that were planted at Eagle House were removed to make way for a housing estate. Other trees have been planted along with replacements for lost memorials. An art work was created to note the impact of Eagle House and of Annie Kenney (hosted by Emily Blathwayt) created by artist Jeni Wood in 2016.

Mühlemann was selected for a chairmanship in Zurich in 1953, Switzerland and much of Europe was in desperate straits in terms of dental/oral health. Dental offices were booked up for months in advance, and there was a shortage of dentists. There was scarcely time for the placement of adequate restorations. In the post-war years, children in Switzerland developed four carious teeth per year; frequently, the first permanent molars were extracted in 7 to 9-year olds for “prophylactic” reasons.Marthaler TM: Decrease of DMF-levels 4 years after the introduction of a caries-preventive program, observations in 5,819 schoolchildren of 20 communities. Helv Odontol Acta 1972; 16:45–68 During his years in the United States, Mühlemann had learned that caries incidence could be significantly reduced through fluoridation of the communal water supply. The assumption at that time was that fluoride by way of the blood vascular system would be incorporated into tooth substance during tooth development, and positively affect caries resistance. Mühlemann was able to demonstrate that fluoride was also effective when applied topically after tooth eruption; this led him to the development of fluoride-containing dentifrice and mouthwash, and also to the fluoridation of table salt.Mühlemann, H.R. und König, K.G. (Editor/Publisher.): The Present Status of Caries Prevention with Fluorine-containing Dentifrices. Bern und Stuttgart (Verlag H. Huber) 1961 He created a Caries Research Station led by Klaus G. König, who was called to a professorship in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, in 1968.Regolati B, König KG, Mühlemann HR. Effects of topically applied disinfectants on caries in fissures and smooth surfaces of rat molars. Helv Odontol Acta. 1969 Apr;13(1):28-31. Mühlemann was a member of numerous Swiss (SGP, SSO, ARPA, SSP) and international dental organizations (ORCA, FDI, ADA, AAP). == Research == Together with Thomas M. Marthaler and Klaus G. König, Mühlemann organized a symposium in Zurich in 1961 to disseminate his ideas about caries prevention. Using practical measures such as tooth brushing with fluoride, proper at-home tooth cleaning methods, and reduction of sugar consumption, he called for the cessation of the caries epidemic. Happy Tooth logo Numerous research studies emanating from the Caries Research Station demonstrated which foodstuffs were responsible for rapid caries development. Mühlemann was able to demonstrate that topically applied fluoride reduced the acid solubility of tooth enamel and therewith incidence of dental caries.Mühlemann HR. The cariostatic effect of amine fluorides. I. 10 years of experiences]. Quintessenz. 1967 May;18(5):113-20. II. Quintessenz. 1967 Jun 6;18(6):123-7 These studies led Mühlemann to the conclusion that fluoride incorporated into a dentifrice could exert a caries prophylactic effect. This conclusion was substantiated by numerous researchers at the University of Zurich Dental Institute. (Marthaler/Mühlemann/König: elmex® researchMarthaler TM, König KG, Mühlemann HR. The effect of a fluoride gel used for supervised toothbrushing 15 or 30 times per year. Helv Odontol Acta. 1970 Oct;14(2):67-77). Over the course of 45 years, Prof. Thomas M. Marthaler conducted epidemiologic studies of Zurich school children; these were repeated every four years. This permitted Marthaler to report a 95% reduction of dental caries in 7- to 14-year-olds in Zurich and overall in Switzerland in the period from 1964 to 2006. A significant component of this success was the development and marketing of non-sucrose sweeteners and food additives. Mühlemann and his colleagues developed a radio-telemetric method for determination of the damaging potential of sweeteners.Graf H, Mühlemann HR. Telemetry of plaque pH from interdental area. Helv Odontol Acta. 1966 Oct;10(2):94-101. Products with low caries-inducing potential were permitted to use this fact in marketing endeavors. To this end, Mühlemann initiated a signet that could be used on products shown to be safe for teeth.Imfeld T, Hirsch RS, Mühlemann HR. Telemetric recordings of interdental plaque pH during different meal patterns. Br Dent J. 1978 Jan 17;144(2):40-5 This signet, a healthy tooth under a broad umbrella, is acknowledged today the world over. During this intense period of laboratory and clinical research, Mühlemann founded the Continental European Division of the International Association of Dental Research (CED-IADR, 1964–65). In addition to Klaus G. König and Thomas M. Marthaler, other coworkers supported and enhanced Mühlemann’s endeavors and were individually successful in their academic careers. These include names such as Hubert E. Schroeder, founder of Oral Structural Biology in Zurich,Schroeder HE. Orale Strukturbiologie. Stuttgart, Thieme Verlag; 2009 Bruno Regolati, who continued the research in caries prevention, Hans Graf and Thomas Imfeld, who advanced and perfected intraoral pH-telemetry, and Bernhard Guggenheim, who demonstrated the significance of oral microbiology and immunology.Guggenheim B, Guggenheim M, Gmür R, Giertsen E, Thurnheer T. Application of the Zürich biofilm model to problems of cariology. Caries Res. 2004 May-Jun;38(3):212-22 In addition to these endeavors with dental caries, Mühlemann devoted himself as early as the 1960s to the treatment and prevention of periodontitis. In close collaboration with Klaus H. Rateitschak, Heinz H. Renggli, Jean-Pierre Bernimoulin, Zvonimir Curilovic and Herbert F. Wolf, he presented continuing education courses and wrote textbooks dealing with the pathophysiology and the systematic therapy of periodontitis.Wolf H, Rateitschak E, Rateitschak KH. Parodontologie, 3. Aufl. Stuttgart: Thieme; 2004: 10-11 His textbooks became the gold standards for dental students in Switzerland, and were translated into many different languages. The introduction of the profession of Dental Hygiene was another of Mühlemann’s goals, which he supported vigorously. Since 1973, four dental hygiene schools were founded, educating auxiliary personnel for the prevention of oral diseases and for conservative periodontal therapy.Calderoli G. Allreed H. Saxer, U.P. and Winter J.E.: Role and training of auxiliary dental staff in the council of Europe member state and Finland.

J Prev Dent 4, 20-22, 1977 After the caries epidemic in Switzerland was brought under control as a result of scientific research, fluoridated dentifrice, salt fluoridation and fluoridation of communal water supplies in Basel, Mühlemann focused his energies into other projects.Imfeld T.

The evolution of the CEREC system.J Am Dent Assoc. 2006 Sep;137 Suppl:7S-13S. == Publications == Mühlemann published his research results in more than 400 scientific papers. His textbook “Introduction to Oral Preventive Medicine” (1974d/1976e) became a standard text for students of dental medicine. In order to give the public broad information about the many practical research results from his laboratories and clinics, Mühlemann organized a dental public health exhibition displayed in many department stores and shopping centers in Switzerland, and even on busses and street cars. It was known as “Healthy Smile – Joyful Mouth.” The exhibit became a road show for over eight years in most Swiss cities, and was presented by Dental Hygienists and other dental auxiliary personnel. By way of this national exhibition and the first Dental Hygiene school in Switzerland, Mühlemann’s concept of good, preventive dental care was disseminated to a wide audience of lay persons.Wanderausstellung: Lachen gesund-Freude am Mund.

She introduced many Scandinavian writers to the Netherlands, such as Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Selma Lagerlöf. She resisted the idea that a woman's role in society was in the home, and founded several cooperative organisations to further women's economic independence. She considered herself less a socialist, communist or feminist than a pacifist. == Early life and time in Groningen == Margaretha Meijboom was born in Amsterdam, the second daughter in a family of five boys and three girls. Her mother was Anjes H. F. Tydeman; her father, Louis Suson Pedro Meijboom, was a liberal minister of the Dutch Reformed Church. She inherited a deep social interest from him. Thanks to her Danish ancestry, she came to know Scandinavian literature, and when she was 17 she taught herself Danish. She later became a Sunday school teacher. Her father died in 1874, and in 1881 the rest of the family moved to The Hague. There she continued to be active as a social worker and teacher. In 1890 Meijboom travelled to Copenhagen. There she attended lectures by the linguist Otto Jespersen, and became a certified translator in Danish and Norwegian. She also came into contact with recent public developments, such as the formation of a public library and, in the Vesterbro district, the idea of a cooperative commune. After her return to the Netherlands she organised lectures on this topic and published about it. Until 1898 she lived in Groningen with her stepbrother, the university professor Hajo Uden Meyboom, and his family. In 1894 she became a board member of the Damesleesmuseum, a public library for women in The Hague. Together with Claudine Bienfait, another translator of Scandinavian languages, she made sure that the library included beside publications on social issues as well as literature. In the early 1890s Meijboom published several remarkable articles on women and housekeeping in the Sociaal Weekblad and in a book titled Vrouwenwerk (Women's Work). Meijboom was a strong voice in the debate on the 1897 feminist novel ' by Cecile van Beek en Donk. In 1897 Meijboom met the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. In addition to works by Lagerlöf (such as the children's book The Wonderful Adventures of Nils), she translated the work of such Scandinavian writers as Henrik Ibsen, Knut Hamsun and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson into Dutch. She also translated into Dutch from English The Inner Life and other works by the founder of the Sufi Movement, Zia Inayat Khan. == The Hague == In 1898 Meijboom moved to The Hague, where she became involved in the founding of the organisation that was to hold the , a national exhibition of women's labour inspired by an 1895 exhibition in Copenhagen. During this event the idea emerged to found a cooperative, the Coöperatieve Vereeniging 'De Wekker'. In 1901, a textile factory in The Hague was converted into a cooperative corporation, where all female workers earned a fixed salary, a share in the profit and a pension. Meijboom became president of the Governing Board. De Wekker produced and sold arts and crafts objects, small pieces of furniture and mainly reform clothing, loosely fitting dresses that replaced the corset. At its pinnacle 60 women were working for the cooperative. From 1902 to 1904 Meijboom was editor of the weekly Lente, and in 1904 she founded the magazine Scandia. After publication of both magazines had ceased, she started the monthly Scandinavië-Nederland. For sixteen years, Meijboom was secretary of the Dutch Cooperative Women's Association (Nederlandse Coöperatieve Vrouwenbond), founded in 1900, and wrote about women and youth in its magazine De Coöperator. She was initiator of the Broederschapsfederatie (1918), a collaborative project for theosophists, spiritualists, Esperantists, teetotalers, vegetarians and adherents of the (Pure Life) movement. She was also a board member of the International Cooperative Women's Guild, founded in Ghent in 1924. == Westerbro == Commune Westerbro in Rijswijk In reaction to the 1903 general strike, Meijboom came to the conclusion that a radical transformation of society was needed. She therefore co-founded, with Clara and Antonia Bokkes, the Cooperative Association 'Westerbro' in Rijswijk. In September 1924 Meijboom and Bokkes moved to Voorburg, because of Bokkes' bad health, and founded the commune 'Nieuw Westerbro' (New Westerbro). Meijboom died there three years later. She was buried in the cemetery in Rijswijk. The Broederschapsfederatie and the Coöperatieve Vrouwenbond placed an oaken monument on her grave with the inscription: \\"Her mind was the key that unlocked old hearts to new world ideas.\\"\\"Haar geest werd de sleutel, die oude harten ontsloot voor een nieuwe wereldgedachte.\\" The International Institute of Social History holds the archive of Margaretha Meyboom. == Publications == * Oude wijn in nieuwe vaten (1885) * In het klooster (1890) * Vrouwenwerk: schetsen (1896) * Handleiding bij het zelfonderricht van 't Deensch (Noorsch) (1896) * De vrouwenbeweging in Nederland en Hilda van Suylenburg (1898) * Open brief aan Anna de Savornin Lohman naar aanleiding van haar brochure 'De liefde in de vrouwenkwestie' (1899) * De geschiedenis van 'De Wekker' (1901) * Leercursus Deensch met spreekoefeningen in geluidschrift (1907) * Een tuinschool (1909) * Jonas Lie.

Upon the success of Witchblade, Christina Z. wrote episodes of Tales of the Witchblade, a series that told historical events of the mythic weapon and Witchblade Destiny's Child series. A split anthology series titled Shadowplay by IDW was one of the first R-rated comics that was written by Christina Z. and illustrated by UK artist Ashley Wood. The theme of the book covered extreme BDSM themes and body modification. A relaunch of the Tigra character initially created by Jack Kirby in 1972 was given a trademark intimate series by Christina Z. for Marvel Comics by portraying the character in a vulnerable yet powerful perspective. It was pencilled by Mike Deodato Jr. and edited by Tom Brevoort. As a natural progression, Christina Z. took her first child-friendly project by penning the Powerpuff Girls comics for DC Comics. Acclaim Comics held the license for Master Darque and was relaunched as Darque Passages with Christina Z. as the writer and Hellblazer artist Leonardo Manco. Under the editing team of Fabian Nicieza and Jeff Gomez, the relaunch consisted of a pre-release ashcan and was considered a great success that led the publishing company to relaunch their cadre of other historic characters. Due to the success of the hit video game Bloodrayne, Echo 3 Worldwide contacted Christina Z. to launch the Bloodrayne series. It tells the violent story of a Dhampir, half human, half vampire. Artistic duties were handled by illustrator Kody Chamberlain of Vampire series, \\"30 Days of Night\\" fame. Progressing into self-produced comics, comic book and Blizzard video game artist Trent Kaniuga and Christina Z. collaborated in creating a relaunch of his creator-owned Creed called Utopiate under the imprint of Image Comics. The book was painted by Kaniuga with the graphic design, writing and lettering done by Christina Z. In 2008, Business magnate Richard Branson hopped into the comics world with Shadow Hunter, a comic book with the combination of adult film star Jenna Jameson as the main character and Christina Z. as the writer in a supernatural series.

As a part of new module, Kazi and Hamza created a spin-off series Coke Studio Explorer which was released on 3 July 2018 and featured regional but largely unknown artists across the country where their performances were recorded live. The series opened to rave reviews and received critical acclaim. Despite the success of Explorer series, season eleven, received mixed reception from the critics.

After Strings departure, it was earlier reported that Noori will take charge as a new producers, however their publicist denied such reports. In March 2018, Coca- Cola Pakistan announced Ali Hamza and Zohaib Kazi would helm the production and direction of eleventh season. Coca-Cola officially released a statement saying that \\"both Coke Studio veterans\\" have played \\"an instrumental role in its success over the years. We cannot wait to share their brilliance with all of you\\" in the \\"new chapter of the Coke Studio\\" journey. Fahad Qadir who is a director of public Affairs and communications of Coca-Cola, revealed on approaching Kazi and Hamza saying, \\"I think it was a natural evolution. Rohail Hyatt came to a point where he thought change was good\\" and \\"he brought Coke Studio where it is today. Strings had a different sound and brought in a different bag of producers. […] These are the producers we feel have the right blend, the experience, the history with Coke Studio the understanding of Coke Studio to take it to the next level.\\" In July 2018, Arab News revealed that Hamza and Kazi had first met in August 2017 in Lahore, two months before they were approached for the show. Kazi recounts, \\"that was the first time we connected on a personal level\\", while Hamza told, \\"We sat down to talk very specifically about this opportunity\\", and within minutes \\"I truly felt I had known Zohaib for a long time.\\" They told Dawn Images in an interview that before they \\"started speaking to Coca-Cola\\", they \\"talked generally, about life and people and Pakistan\\". They had long discussions about the responsibility that Coke Studio had to be spread across the country to attract both; urban and rural areas; as \\"the regions and its people collectively make Pakistan.\\" The series went into production in April 2018 and finished filming the following month at Karachi. Post-production took place in June and July at Front Food Media in Lahore. ===Coke Studio Explorer=== As a part of a new module, a spin-off series Coke Studio Explorer was created before the launch of season, on a concept similar to Kazi's previous work on his album Fanoos that featured relatively unknown artists across the country where recordings were done live and edited later. In an interview to Daily Times by the duo, Kazi explained, \\"in Fanoos, we limited ourselves to recording musicians on location. We do much more in Coke Studio Explorer by highlighting the culture, stories and ethos behind the music. After presenting the musicians in their home locations, we bring them to our studios\\" to record in traditional Coke Studio style too. Hamza said, \\"we established the criteria for selection before embarking on our search for musicians\\", they \\"had to be talented\\" and to \\"to represent a unique aspect of the culture, history and spirit of Pakistan.\\" The duo developed a special mobile recording system for the on- location recordings and while additional tracks and engineering was completed in studio. The duo travelled in all four provinces and Kashmir to find artists that were known in their native regions but were unknown to mainstream media. The duo discovered a sixteen-year old pair of Amrina and Ariana from Kalash, Chitral, the brother-sister duo of Vishnu and Shamu Bai from Deewan Lal Chand a village in interior Sindh, while from Sohbatpur District, Balochistan they found throat-singers Mangal, Darehan and Shayan (now known as Bloach Throat singers), a fusion band Qasamir lead by Altaf Mir with Ghulam Mohammad Daar, Manzoor Ahmed Khan, Saifuddin Shahfrom from Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and the fifth and final collaboration was with Mishal Khawaja a Pakistani born- Canadian singer, who was discovered through her Instagram covers. The Explorer series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise given to its new module, diversity, performances and Coke Studio efforts in showcasing and bringing the indigenous art form of Pakistan to the mainstream media. ===Debutants and comebacks=== Among thirty-nine artists, fifteen musicians debut with season eleven including seven bands, five duos, and three solo artists. Actor and singer Ahad Raza Mir, Lahore-based rapper Young Desi; singer Elizabeth Rai who is particularly known for her song in the film Teri Meri Love Story and Illinois-based duo Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf of Krewella made their debuts. Four of five artists from Coke Studio Explorer series appeared in the season, while singers Riaz Qadri and Ghulam Qadri along with hip-hop band L.U.G (Lyari UnderGround), who previously worked with Kazi on his album Fanoos, also made their debuts. For the first time in the history of Coke Studio, two transgender singers, Naghma and Lucky were included as featured artists. Their appearance received overwhelming response from media critics and people. Several featured artists returned from previous seasons as well, including Humera Arshad who was on hiatus before appearing in the tenth season. Arshad remarked, \\"this will be the beginning of a new phase for me in my singing career.\\" ==Release== First episode was screened in a special event at Pearl-Continental Hotel in Lahore, attended by Coke Studio team, artists and notable personalities including Allama Iqbal's family. During the release the marketing director Abbas Arslan revealed the show features \\"12 languages, 35 instruments with 70 artists whove composed more than 40 songs.\\" Stating further he said, \\"Ali and Zohaib travelled 5500 kilometers\\" to discover \\"Explorer artists\\" that were included in the season. Sharing on how they wanted to be season-eleven Kazi said, \\"music is a powerful tool to spread a message so this is ours to the world. From Hunza to Karachi we have many gems and we must find pride in them all\\". After the Friday release of webisode, these were broadcast on Saturday on radio stations and television channels of Pakistan. ===Promo song=== Preceding the release of season, as a part of a traditional format, Coke Studio revealed this year featured artists performing a rendition of popular nazm, \\"Hum Dekhenge\\" by poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, originally recorded by Iqbal Bano. The promo song also manifests the nation's political situation in the midst of general elections. On continuing the tradition of title song, Kazi and Hamza said that this season's journey of began with Coke Studio Explorer, \\"we couldn't be more confident about the power of human stories coming together to form a bigger picture\\", so \\"there couldn't be a better choice for a track than: \\"Hum Dekhenge\\" – A song by sung the people of Pakistan, for the people of Pakistan!\\" The song was well received by critics and public. ===Episodes=== Each episode is titled accordingly. {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\"# ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Artist(s) ! colspan=\\"2\\"Song(s) Performed ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Note(s) - !

This is what many are calling a bonus to the upcoming season that aims to discover musical talent from all across Pakistan.\\" Actor turned musician Arshad Mehmud said, \\"the new season of Coke Studio comes with a message of love, unity, passion and pride that is exceedingly relevant to the current times. It should be heard, savoured and celebrated.\\" Forbes contributor journalist, Sony Rehman from Lahore marked, \\"Coke Studio's previous seasons have dealt with its fair share of criticism and mixed reactions over certain song selections and collaborations, gauging by Coke Studio Explorer, it may just hit all the right notes this year.\\" The season has been praised for its diversity and inclusion of new artists, Ali Samoo wrote, \\"this season seems to have made a very strong effort to cast an all-inclusive and representative musical spirit, painting a vibrant picture of Pakistan for the world to see. It is perhaps to show us how togetherness is what makes us beautiful, to prevent a divide and to convey solidarity amongst the nationals. The culturally pluralist amalgamation was perhaps made also to make the election time a bit more peaceful.\\" However, season eleven received mixed reception from critics and public, criticizing the quality of music as compared to previous seasons. Imane Babar Wahedi of The Express Tribune was more critical of the show saying, \\"the producers focus on delivering decent performances, rather than trying too hard to be innovative,\\" she further said, \\"their efforts have been praiseworthy in terms of bringing diversity to Coke Studio, but on a separate note, they shouldn't be neglecting the quality of their music.\\" The first episode received mixed reception from critics and publications; it was praised for its diversity both in music and casting, but it was critically reviewed for its quality of music. Writing for The Express Tribune, Ramsha Vistro remarked, \\"the episode managed to display an array of formations and stood for change featuring transgenders and an all-female band. I think it's safe to say, Coke Studio's latest offering did not fail to make a mark.\\" The songs \\"Main Irada\\" and \\"Shika/Jawab-e-Shikwa\\" received critical acclaim. Second episode contained a mix of traditional and modern rendition of songs receiving mixed reception from the critics. Rahul Aijaz of The Express Tribune quipped, \\"Hamza and Kazi are surely bringing a change to Coke Studio. They get full points for innovation. But overall, the sound isn't mature enough yet. I can't decide whether it's because the producers are trying too hard or because they are more concerned about implementing their ideology, even if that compromises on the music.\\" Episode three garnered positive reception, with particular praise was given to Fareed Ayaz and Abu Muhammad performance of \\"Piya Ghar Aya\\", while Express Tribune concluded the episode with moderate reception saying, \\"after what was a generally disappointing start to the season, Coke Studio is somewhat back on track with episode three. The Esakhelvi duo brought something fresh, Fareed Ayaz, Abu Muhammad Qawwal and Brothers gave us a taste of what we originally loved about the show, and Bagga topped it all off with a melody nostalgic of an era long gone. Song \\"Roye Roye\\" achieved mixed reception among the third episode, some praising the song as \\"nostalgic revival of old school melodies\\", and some complained it for its \\"clichéd lyrics\\", Maheen Sabeeh of The News International bemoaned \\"a song that's a bit too long and in the end sounds like a pop ditty gone awry with equally tedious lyrics and every instrument thrown on the board, for example, a weeping flute. It's a bit like suffering to listen to this suffering ballad of a song.\\" Episode four also drew mixed reception, however, Chand Tara Orchestra's performance received critical acclaim, while the other two songs \\"Atish\\" and \\"Mahi Aaja\\" received moderate reception. ==Notes and referencesNotes=References= * Official Website Category:Coke Studio (Pakistani TV program) Category:2018 Pakistani television seasons Category:2018 Pakistani television series debuts ","title":"Coke Studio (Pakistani season 11)"},{"id":"56785995","text":"Simon Flem Devold birthname Helge Flem Devold (17 March 1929 – 20 May 2015) born in Namsos, Norway, was a Norwegian author, journalist and jazz clarinetist. When he was three years of age he and his family moved to Ålesund, where he was raised. His change of name from Helge to Simon occurred in connection with his affiliation with Subud, a worldwide association with Indonesian Indonesian roots where «the desire for the individual is to find the person you want to be here on earth».. In 2012, Devold received the Fritt Ord Honorary Award for his «groundbreaking commitment as a facilitator of children's voices, life experiences and rights» through the column «På skråss» in Aftenposten, often based on taboo themes. == Author and writer == Devold is perhaps best known as a representative and defender for the children, including through his regular column in Aftenposten, «På skråss». Devold's debuted as author with the book Gutta og jeg in 1973, a collection of portraits of city originals. He has written 17 books, equally distributed between books on children's understanding of life and rights, and books on urban originals. His perhaps most famous book, Morten, 11 år, has been translated into Swedish, German, Dutch and Japanese. He also worked as a journalist at Sunnmørsposten, where he was particularly noted with his sharp pen – and the figure Maskemakk, which featured in Sunnmørsposten in the 1970s and was known for its quaint English: «The fast-window went on reason» (Hurtigruta ran aground). == The musician == Devold led the S.F.D. Quartet, and in recent years he played a lot with Tord Gustavsen. Devold's quartet played swing jazz à la Benny Goodman, and from the mid-1950s he was one of the most famous jazz groups in Norway, especially in his genre. The quartet originally consisted of Devold (Clarinet and Saxophone), Ivar Skuseth (Vibraphone), Kåre Halvorsen (Piano) and Leif Hessen (Drums). The quartet was periodically expanded to quintet with additional guitar accompaniment. Devold contributed to Turid Lisbeth Nygård's children's jazz record Trollhalen (Musico, 2001). Together with Marit Carlsen he released the album Swingende Barnetro (KKV, 1989), and with Jon Kirkebø Rosslund and Pål Are Bakksjø he provided jazz kindergarten at Hemnesjazz (1999). == Children of the Earth == In 1987 Devold got the idea that Nordkapp could be used for something of positive importance far beyond Norway's borders. In collaboration with, among others, Nordkapps Vel, seven children from different parts of the earth gathered at Nordkapp. Hence the name of the Barn av Jorden (Children of the Eart). The project has been transformed into an award given to a person or project that has shown care and ability to help distressed children. Barn av Jorden's Prize are worth NOK 100,000 and are awarded each year in June at Nordkapp. == Honors == * Hirschfeldtprisen 1965 * Name of the Year at Dagbladet 1984 * TV profile of the year at Se og Hør 1985 * Paul Robesonprisen 1988 * Brobyggerprisen 1996 * Brummprisen 1996 * Wandaprisen 1998 * Tulipanprisen 2000 * King's Medal of Merit in gold 2002 * Åpenhetsprisen 2006 * Barnehelseprisen 2011 * Fritt Ord Honorary Award 2012 == References  External links == * Tordg.no/simon om duoen med Tord Gustavsen * www.barnavjorden.org – Barn av Jorden * Alle barns «Simon» takker for seg * Fritt Ords Honnør Category:2015 deaths Category:1929 births Category:Norwegian jazz clarinetists Category:Recipients of the King's Medal of Merit in gold Category:Norwegian non-fiction writers Category:People from Namsos Category:People from Ålesund Category:Aftenposten people ","title":"Simon Flem Devold"},{"id":"56786009","text":"Rosa Jochmann (19 July 1901 - 28 January 1994) was an Austrian resistance activist and Ravensbrück survivor who became a politician (SPÖ). == Life  Provenance and early years === Rosa Jochmann was born in the 20th district of Vienna, the fourth of her parents' six children. Her father worked as an iron foundryman: her mother worked in domestic service and as a laundry worker. While she was still very young the family moved to the 11th district (Simmering Viertel), in the southeast of the city, where they lived in a succession of rented rooms until 1912 when they moved into an apartment in the one of the new so-called \\"Krankenkassenhäusern\\" (social housing - literally: \\"sickness insurance houses\\") which had been built at the instigation of the socialist politician Laurenz Widholz, alongside the \\"Braunhubergasse\\" (street). She would still be living in southeast Vienna seventy years later. Her parents had both migrated to the capital from Moravia, where her father had been active in the Social democratic movement. Her mother grew up in a Roman Catholic family. The language spoken at home was for the most part Czech - sometimes identified in contemporary sources as \\"Bemisch\\". Jochmann later recalled that her father had never really learned German. He was, according to at least one source, frequently unemployed because of his reputation as a political activist. His daughter later recalled in an interview that he \\"was a Social Democrat who never went to church, but [the children always] had to say their prayers\\". The Jochmann children grew up bilingual. When Rosa Jochmann was fourteen her mother died, aged just forty-one from multiple sclerosis (or, according to other sources, exhaustion). Jochmann later told an interviewer that she had by this time been nursing her sick mother for six years. She now became the principal carer for her two surviving younger sisters, Josefine (Peperle) and Anna (Antschi), while also looking after her father. War had broken out in 1914 and Rosa's brother, Karl, returned with Tuberculosis, the \\"Viennese sickness\\" / \\"Wiener Krankheit\\" as it is described in one source. Karl died in 1920. In his later years her father had a large red scar on his shoulder which had been inflicted with a sabre by a government official on a horse who had been policing a street protest. Rosa was with her father at the demonstration, conducted in order to press for voting rights, when her father received his injury. Like his wife, he never reached old age, dying in 1920 at around the same time as his only son. === Work === As a child it was Rosa Jochmann's ambition to become a nun and teacher, or a mother. When she was eleven, as a top student at her school, she was able to complete a typing and stenography course, which under other circumstances might have opened the way to a teaching career, but her domestic situation closed off that option. Nor would she ever become a mother. In 1915 she started work as an assistant with Victor Schmidt & Söhne, a long established Viennese manufacturer of sweets/candy. Because she was relatively young (and despite her domestic responsibilities) she earned only half as much as older workers, even though she was just as productive as they were. This gave rise to a sense of injustice which would become a theme of her later political activism. Then, because of the war, she was conscripted for work at a cable factory. Here, during a night shift, she dozed off and crushed a finger on the flywheel of a winding-drum. She transferred to the Apollo candle factory (today part of Unilever), after which she ended up at the Auer gas mantle plant. Early on she became a works council member and active trades unionist. In 1920 colleagues at Auer elected her chair of the works council. === Political career === Jochmann's union activism continued, and increasingly came to embrace a wider political activism. In 1926 the head of the Chemical Workers Union, Julius Weiß, arranged for her to be a member of the first group of students at the newly established Workers' Academy (\\"Arbeiterhochschule\\") in Vienna 19 (Döbling). She was one of very few women attending the wide ranging six month course which she completed successfully. Topics included Applied Economics (\\"Nationalökonomie\\"), Public and Civil Law (\\"Staats- und Sozialrecht\\") and Rhetoric. Her teachers included future leaders of the Social Democratic movement in Austria, such as Otto Bauer and Karl Renner. Still aged only 25, she emerged to be appointed union secretary of the Chemical Workers Union. Rosa Jochmann also joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratischen Arbeiterpartei\\" / SDAP) in 1926. She attended that year's party conference, at which the important new party programme was adopted, as an observer, viewing from the visitors' gallery. Very quickly, however, she moved up the party hierarchy. In 1932 she became a member of the party Women's Secretariat. In 1933, at the last party conference before the SDAP was banned, Rosa Jochmann and Helene Postranecky (1903-1995) were elected to the party national executive in succession to Adelheid Popp (1869-1939) and Therese Schlesinger (1863-1940). === Austrofascism === During the four day February Uprising in 1934 Rosa Jochmann was installed inside the Republican Protection League headquarters at George Washington Court. From there she stenographed radio messages, updating the outside world about the progress of the fighting, and then delivering texts to Otto Bauer and Julius Deutsch in the next door room. The insurgency collapsed after the government called in the army. On the night of 12 February 1934 Jochmann was one of those who persuaded the leader of the party, Otto Bauer, that for him to remain in Austria would be personally fatal. Bauer escaped across the border to the north, and would spend the next four years as a political exile in Brno. He instantly resigned the party leadership, but during the difficult years that followed was able to remain in frequent contact with former party comrades as an advisor and inspiration. All the individuals who had been members of the party national executive faced charges of high treason: most were arrested in the days following the armed altercation. Directly after the February events the SDAP was expressly outlawed, in the context of a more far reaching programme of destruction by the Dollfuß government, aimed at Austria's democratic political structure. Jochmann managed to evade immediate capture and continued with - now illegal - party work while using a forged identity card as \\"Josefine Drechsler\\" (which was her younger sister's name). She was able to remain at liberty for more than half a year, and was at the centre of attempts to create an illegal successor organisation to the SDAP. On 26 February 1934 five political comrades who had not been arrested met in a private apartment in Vienna 9: Manfred Ackermann, Roman Felleis, Karl Holoubek, Rosa Jochmann und Ludwig Kostroun initially described themselves as the \\"national group of five\\" (\\"zentralen Fünfergruppe\\"), but were very soon identifying themselves as the \\"Central Committee of the Revolutionary Socialists\\" (\\"Zentralkomitee der Revolutionären Sozialisten\\"). The Revolutionary Socialist movement concentrated on building opposition to the Austrofascist régime. Jochmann addressed illegal rallies, participated in \\"conferences and actions\\" and engaged in the distribution of printed material. Armed with her sister's identity card, she made repeated visits to the Czechoslovak frontier near Brno, from where she smuggled leaflets and bundles of the illegal \\"Arbeiterzeitung\\" (\\"Workers' Newspaper\\") into Austria. There was a widespread perception that the Austrofascist régime would not last, and Revolutionary Socialist political activity, though illegal, was still relatively brazen during the middle part of 1934. Leaflets were distributed and stickers applied to walls and street furniture. There were even public meetings. A commemorative rally was scheduled for 15 July 1934 at the Predigtstuhl Meadows in the Wienerwald (Vienna Woods), just outside the city. Jochmann was due to speak. As she began to address several hundred people the local police, backed up by the gendarmerie stormed the event. Two people were shot. \\"More gendarmes turned up and our people tried to defend themselves. Shots were fired and many people fled. You heard screaming and moaning.\\" === Arrest === On 30 August 1934 Rosa Jochmann arrived at the railway station in Wiener Neustadt carrying two brief cases. She was observed by a police informer as she approached a newspaper kiosk. She was intending to hand over Revolutionary Socialist political leaflets for onward distribution. Police appeared as she reached the kiosk. They arrested Jochmann, confiscated the leaflets and searched the kiosk.\\" Jochmann was detained at Wiener Neustadt for three months before the prosecutor's office ordered that she be transferred back to Vienna, where she was held in investigative detention at the Rossauer Lände jail (known to inmates as the \\"Liesl\\") on behalf of the Vienna district court. By 22 November 1935 Rosa Jochmann would have spent fifteen months in jail, most of which comprised pre-trial detention. Records survive of her interrogation sessions, which when first she was incarcerated often took place several times per day over a succession of days. The investigators were trying to reconstruct the events of the February Uprising, the identities of those involved and their connections with the Republican Protection League. It as not till April 1935 that she was convicted and sentenced. She was guilty of carrying illegal goods - the political printed matter - which was a violation of Press Law. More serious convictions resulted from the police search of the newspaper kiosk at the railway station. The prosecution asserted that evidence had been found for the training of the so-called \\"tens of thousands\\", a quasi-military structure created to engage in illegal activities, and that Jochmann had been serving as a messenger on behalf of the illegal organisation. Further evidence adduced against her involved records of financial transfers as well as a travel card issued by the Lower-Austria rail service which (correctly) included a photograph of Rosa Jochmann but was issued (incorrectly) in the name of her sister, Josefine Drechsler. Her release, which came in November 1935, did little to reduce the pressure on her. She devoted the next few months to looking after friends awaiting their own trials. Comrades who faced trial in Vienna in March 1936 included Bruno Kreisky and Franz Jonas along with Maria Emhart and Jochmann's own partner, the future secretary of state Franz Rauscher. === Re-arrest === On 12 March 1938 German troops marched into Austria. Newsreels showing Austrian crowds cheering the invading columns of soldiers were quickly distributed round the world, but many Austrians, especially those who had been involved in opposition to the Austrofascist régime, had little reason to celebrate Austria's incorporation into an enlarged German state under the control of a post democratic Nazi government. Rosa Jochmann was arrested and faced interrogation later that same month, but was released after two days. Her high-profile record of Social-Democrat activism meant that she remained in obvious danger, but she rejected the opportunity to flee the country. She remained in Vienna and took work with a Jewish owned textiles company in Vienna's central Salzgries district. Rosa Jochmann was re-arrested on 22 August 1939. She was held by the Gestapo in Vienna for more than half a year. This period of uncertainty ended in March 1940 when she was marked out for \\"protective custody\\" and placed on a train to Germany. She was accompanied by the ominous note on her detention order \\"Rückkehr unerwünscht\\" (loosely \\"not to be sent back\\"). On 21 March 1940 she was delivered to the concentration camp at Ravensbrück, roughly an hour to the north of Berlin for those able to make the journey by car. Here she survived till liberation came in the early summer of 1945. ===Ravensbrück=== Ravensbrück concentration camp held approximately 132,000 women and children, 20,000 men and 1,000 \\"female young people\\", who came, according to registration data, from more than forty nations. Tens of thousands would be murdered or would die from hunger and illness. In the camp developed a close practical comradeship and personal friendship with her political soul-mate, the resistance activist (who faced additional dangers because the authorities had classified her as a half-Jew) Erna Raus (later. Erna Musik). Through the intervention of a fellow inmate, the economist-politician Käthe Leichter, Rosa Jochmann found herself appointed a \\"block senior\\" in the so-called \\"politicals'\\" block till 1943. Appointing inmates to undertake administrative roles gave the camp guards more time for their own priorities. The position was one of privilege but also of heightened political risk. It could provide opportunities to mediate between inmates and the camp authorities, and Jochmann was sometimes able to get together with others in order to arrange extra food rations or medication in cases of exceptional need. Jochmann seems to have managed to find in herself a greater level of physical and mental strength than many. But she still had to stand idly by as her friend and political soulmate Käthe Leichter was taken away to Auschwitz to be murdered. As block senior she took a particular interest in looking after children in ways that increased their chances of surviving the camp. Testimony to that appeared at the end of her life in the form of numerous written expressions of appreciation from those whom she had helped. She also sustained a number of \\"pen pal\\" friendships with people she had known at Ravensbrück. Darker aspects of her role included the two times she was locked up in the so-called \\"bunker\\", the first time for a few weeks and the second time for over six months. A fellow inmate, whom other camp survivors would later identify as a \\"spy\\", had denounced her to the Nazi paramilitaries in charge. After the camp was liberated by Soviet forces in April 1945 Rosa Jochmann was one of many who stayed on for several weeks to help care for survivors. From Austria there came no evidence of any official offer to return the Austrian Ravensbrück survivors across the mountains back to their home country. Jochmann therefore traveled to Vienna with the communist Friederike \\"Friedl\\" Sinclair and negotiated the provision of transport with the Soviet military commander there. She then returned to the camp and helped organise the repatriation. Traveling home with fellow survivors she celebrated her forty-fourth birthday. In Vienna her apartment had been bombed out. She was offered an Aryanised Jewish villa in Vienna 19 (Döbling) from which the Nazi occupants had fled, but she rejected the offer in no uncertain terms, and for some years was happy to live in a single rented room. === After the war === Jochmann resumed her political life as a leftwing member of the SPÖ (as the Social Democratic party was now rebranded). The victorious allied powers had agreed between themselves back in 1943 that Austria should again be separated from Germany as it had been before 1938. Austria's first postwar general election was conducted on 25 November 1945 across Vienna and four military occupation zones into which the rest of the country had been divided. When the new parliamentarians took their seats on 19 December 1945 Rosa Jochmann was among them, a member of the National Council (lower house of the Austrian parliament). She was again a member of the party executive between 1956 and 1967 and deputy chair of the party. She was also, between 1959 and 1967, chair of the SPÖ women (\\"Vorsitzende der SPÖ-Frauen\\"). In 1967, now aged 66, Rosa Jochmann retired from all but one of her political offices. The exception was her role as chair of the \\"Bund sozialistischer Freiheitskämpfer\\" (\\"Association of Socialist Freedom Fighters\\"), which consists of former members of the old Revolutionary Socialists. ===Death and burial=== Rosa Jochmann died following a heart attack at the Hanusch Hospital in Vienna on 28 January 1994. Her body was buried in Vienna's (misleadingly named) Central Cemetery: Group 14C, Number 1A. Her gravestone and adjacent memorial tablet were designed by Leopold Grausam. == Mission == Jochmann warned throughout her life against Far-right extremism and Antisemitism. She presented countless lectures and communicated her own contemporary experiences and insights, addressing schools and as a conference speaker, both in Austria and abroad. Her final high-profile attendance was at the 1993 Lichtermeer mass-event, still (in 2018) the largest demonstration in postwar Austria, held in opposition to anti-foreigner \\"Austrian First\\" populism of the Freedom Party. She spoke out, warning one last time against Far-right extremism and Antisemitism. == Public recognition and celebration == Rosa Jochmann was awarded Honorary citizenship (\\"Ehrenbürgerrecht\\") of Vienna in 1981. In 1995, the year following her death, a street in the Semmering quarter of Vienna was renamed, \\"Rosa-Jochmann-Ring\\" in celebration of her life and contribution. The nearby Rosa Jochmann school and Rosa Jochmann Court residential development have also, subsequently, been renamed in her honour. In the adjacent Leopoldstadt quarter the naming of the Rosa Jochmann Park also honours her memory. In 2004 a newspaper poll reported by the Kurier (Vienna based newspaper) identified Rosa Jochmann as one of the fifty most important Austrians of the last fifty years. == References == Category:Members of the National Council (Austria) Category:Social Democratic Party of Austria politicians Category:Ravensbrück concentration camp survivors Category:Austrian Resistance members Category:Politicians from Vienna Category:1901 births Category:1994 deaths ","title":"Rosa Jochmann"},{"id":"56786049","text":"Lillias Campbell Davidson (1853–1934) was an American-born British writer.

Compared to the cities that were subordinated to governorates, gradonachalniki enjoyed full rights to oversee city self- government (city police administration, supervision of trade, mail, shipping and public, serf and port buildings). The gradonachalnik presided over special city affairs and over the provincial administrative committee when considering cases relating to economic orders in the capital. Gradonachalniki of Odessa, Kerch-Yenikale and Sevastopol were in charge of matters concerning local police, trade and navigation (Charter of the City Planning Code, article 8, Proceedings of 1886). In Sevastopol and Kerch-Yenikale, the posts of gradonachalniki were entrusted to admirals. In Sevastopol, the gradonachalnik was also a commandant and commander of the Sevastopol port.

The series stars Luis Gerónimo Abreu as Bolívar as an adult, José Ramón Barreto as Bolívar as a young man, Irene Esser as Bolívar's wife María Teresa del Toro, and Shany Nadan as his lover Manuela Sáenz. Maximiliano Gómez stars as Bolívar as a child. It was released on Netflix worldwide, except for Colombia, on 21 June 2019, followed by its debut in Colombia on Caracol Televisión on 18 September 2019. The show is made up of 60 episodes that document the events of Bolívar's life from the age of seven until his death, primarily focusing on his formation as the liberator of several South American countries and his romantic engagements. However, the cast and crew also describe the show as an attempt to remove the veil of heroism covering the man and re-humanize him. It was popular in Latin America, but the telenovela style and format alienated international viewers. Before its release, the show was publicly criticized by disputed Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, with commenters believing he was concerned that a less legendary image of Bolívar would further reduce his popular support. == Plot == The story begins with Simón Bolívar as a soldier rousing his comrades who have grown weary in the fight for independence, before flashing back to his wedding day in Spain and again to his childhood. A young Simón enjoys all the luxuries of a criollo life until his mother, then grandfather, die, leaving his future in the hands of a maternal uncle who wants to take the Bolívar fortune as his own. Simón, an active child, finds it hard to respond to traditional tutelage and is put under the care of a rebel, watching as the Spanish crown punishes dissenters. As he ages into young adulthood, he initially joins the military, but finds more success as a statesman, and travels to Spain to both further his education and seek the title afforded his name. Arriving in Spain, two of his wayward uncles have managed to make waves in society and introduce Simón to a suitable tutor who is well-regarded by the crown. It is under his care that Simón meets María Teresa, whom he intends to woo; unfortunately, an entitled Spaniard also wishes to pursue her, and tries to dirty Bolívar's name in the process. Through his charm and wit, Bolívar comes through his time in Spain a more well-regarded man and returns to Venezuela; he is without the title he was after, but with María Teresa as his bride. María Teresa, a humble woman, immediately takes to helping at the haciendas and humanizing the workers and slaves; she is also infinitely loyal to Simón, and purchases back his beloved house slave Matea. In the meantime, a new royal judge is appointed to Venezuela, who is friendly with María Teresa and subsequently to the Bolívar family. Simón's eldest sister, María Antonia, begins falling for him after asking for a loan, at the same time as María Teresa begins falling ill from an insect bite that she has not been exposed to in Spain. When she dies, Simón vows he will live in her spirit and never marry again. In Ecuador, a young Manuela Sáenz gets into trouble at her convent. Simón travels to Paris to drown his sorrows; here, he is reunited with his favorite teacher and his friend Fernando del Toro. In Venezuela, María Antonia and the judge begin an affair, from which she becomes pregnant, and their greedy uncle dies destitute. Simón is encouraged to start living rather than drinking and sleeping around by his reunited companions, and ultimately enrages Napoleon's son-in-law enough to have himself firmly barred from the city; he returns to Venezuela to meet with the Caracas junta trying to govern Venezuela and propose a movement to independence. In Quito, Manuela begins to behave in order to be let out of the convent, succeeding and witnessing the 2 August uprising; her father feels she sympathizes with the cause too strongly and sends her to live with a maternal uncle, a priest, not knowing that he craves revolution, too. == Cast and characters == An extensive cast list was published in July 2019 by Peruvian outlet El Comercio. In March 2018, Caracol announced members of the cast. * Luis Gerónimo Abreu as Simón Bolívar ** José Ramón Barreto as Young Simón ** Maximiliano Gómez as Child Simón * Rosmeri Marval as María Antonia Bolívar Palacios * Erick Rodríguez as Pablo Clemente Palacios * Adrián Makala as José Palacios (mayordomo) * Irene Esser as María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaysa * Mauro Donetti as Feliciano Palacios de Aguirre y Ariztía-Sojo y Gil de Arratia * Álvaro Bayona as Carlos Palacios y Blanco * Juan Ángel as Bernardino del Toro Alayza * Nohely Arteaga as María de la Concepción Palacios y Blanco * Bryan Ruiz as Juan Vicente Bolívar * Leónidas Urbina as José Antonio Páez * Hans Martínez as Francisco de Paula Santander * Juan Fernando Sánchez as José María Córdova * Jefferson Quiñones as Dionisio Bolívar ** Adolfo Murillo as Child Dionisio * Mauricio Mejía as Juan José Rondón * Ed Hughes as Daniel Florencio O'Leary * Juan Carlos Ortega as General James Rooke * Abril Schreiber as Pepita * Adelaida Buscato as Lucía * Carlos Gutiérrez as Joaquín Montesinos * Bárbara Perea as Hipólita Bolívar * Margoth Velásquez as Tomasa * Jorge Sánchez as Luis Tinoco * Ana Harlem as Matea Bolívar * Juan de Xaraba as José Patricio de Rivera * Pablo Soler as Secretario Oídor * Laura Leyton as Juana Nepomucena * Giroly Gutiérrez as Doctor Virgilio Trespalacios * Pedro Roda as Soldado Ponte * Esperanza Rivas as Mirta María * Manuel Vallejo as Víctor * José María Galeano as Felipe Martínez == Production Development=== The show was one of Colombia's most expensive to produce ever, with its producers describing it as the \\"most ambitious series in the history of Colombian television.\\" It was created by Caracol and co-produced with Netflix, which has a global distribution deal for the series; Netflix has previously distributed several Caracol shows, including The Girl, The Queen of Flow, Undercover Law, and Surviving Escobar: Alias JJ. The show is not dubbed into English, unlike other Spanish-language media on Netflix, but has subtitles in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. According to Semana, Caracol did not use deadlines when creating the series, instead letting their teams work to make the show as good as it could be. Additionally, as the landmark series produced for the company's 50th anniversary and the bicentennial of independence, it was reportedly given \\"unequaled scrutiny\\". The producers considered many influences and potential creatives for the show, looking at the best of Colombian telenovelas like Yo soy Betty, la fea, and talent including screenwriter Julio Jimenez and actor Diego Álvarez. Ultimately, Juana Uribe was chosen to be showrunner and head writer. Uribe then brought on two historians, a researcher, and three writers \\"who had read practically every biography in existence\\" about Bolívar. Rather than a straight telenovela, the show has been described as an historical biography or period drama, as well. As a period drama, the show used costume design to present the period accurately; the hats worn by Manuela have been described as exact to the different locales she inhabits, as well as period. Shany Nadan also commented that because of the different views on personal appearance at the time, \\"it did not matter if [she] showed up with rumpled hair\\" to film, as that is how it would have been in reality. === Casting and characterization === Luis Gerónimo Abreu plays the oldest iteration of Simón Bolívar, and worked on creating his character with fellow actor José Ramón Barreto On 7 March 2018, José Ramón Barreto and Irene Esser were confirmed as protagonists of the first part of the story. Luis Gerónimo Abreu was confirmed for the second part, along with Shany Nadan to depict Manuela Sáenz. Of the three actors to play Bolívar, only one is not Venezuelan: the Colombian actor Maximiliano Gómez. About 400 actors are used in the series, with 6,000 extras. The storytelling intention during the conception of the series was discussed by Abreu in interviews. According to BBC Mundo, the show \\"intersperses the story of the young and orphaned Bolívar and the angry, idealistic and passionate Bolívar\\"; in his interview, Abreu said that the creative team did this because they \\"wanted to humanize him, with his defects and his mistakes, [...] Because Bolívar was not a bronze superhero like the statues, but a human being, rather small and modest, who without superpowers became a superhero of flesh and blood.\\" To create the character, Abreu, Barreto, and the writers and directors had meetings where they built their version of Bolívar. They designed him in a way to bring him down to a realistic level rather than be the hero taught in history classes, because, according to Abreu, Venezuelan people think \\"he was a superhero or that he had a space hammer or that a radioactive spider bit him\\", referring to popular Marvel Comics superheros. Barreto explains this further, saying that while he felt honored to play the hero he grew up with, he also hoped that the series would allow people to interrogate Bolívar's life and \\"question for themselves the cult that has been given to 'the military, the boots, the leaders'.\\" Barreto says he hopes for this because of the nation's political crisis, saying that Venezuela in 2019 \\"doesn't need a liberator [...] We need 30 million liberators, a population who become aware of the historical moment we are in and who do not wait for a liberator. That would be a mistake. We need to mature as a society so as not to repeat those historical errors.\\" As with Bolívar, Nadan indicates there was the same aim to give her role as Manuela Sáenz a more complex characterization, saying that the production \\"wanted her to be fascinating and charming, strong but feminine, cunning and strategist, fresh but passionate, proud but also dedicated and generous\\". She explains that to embody Manuelita, she trained with three acting coaches for several months, exploring what made her the person she was, as well as taking horseback riding lessons. Abreu has said that the show presents an image of Manuela that reinforces the value of women in war. Barreto was contacted about casting when his telenovela, Para verte mejor (in which he was also co-lead with Abreu), was ending in 2017. To help him land the role, he borrowed a stallion from a friend's club to practice riding on, dressing up as Bolívar to make a demonstration video of his skills and his passion to get the iconic image of Bolívar correct that he sent to the producers. After being cast, he was given more formal horseback riding lessons, as well as combat ones. Of his casting, Barreto says he expected to get the role of Juan Vicente, though he auditioned for Simón, because he does not think he looks like Simón Bolívar; on the press tour he used this story to tell people in Colombia that, unlike what many are used to in the region, television may now be casting more by talent than appearance. === Filming === The del Toro's La Sierra retreat was filmed in Pedraza, with the producers describing it as frozen in time Filming of the series began on 7 March 2018 in Cartagena, Colombia. The series was shot primarily in Colombia, featuring cities such as Villa de Leyva, Monguí, Santa Fe de Antioquia, Calí, Popayán, and natural areas in the Los Nevados National Natural Park, El Páramo de Oceta, as well as the Eastern Plains of Colombia. In May 2018, Caracol, with the assistance of local production by Galdo Medio, began filming in Spain. Scenes in Spain were shot in Toledo, with the production also being able to shoot some scenes on the Lavaderos de Rojas estate; in Aranjuez; and in Pedraza. Some parts of the series were filmed between the border of Venezuela and Colombia. Three production units were used, with simultaneous filming lasting from March through September 2018. Producer Asier Aguilar says that finding locations to recreate the colonial settings was difficult, but that trying to find locations for certain historical moments set in Venezuela was harder because of the country's biodiversity; as an example, Aguilar says that they had to recreate a low-lying coastal Vargas swamp in a town near Boyacá, 3,000 metres up in the Andes mountains. ==ReceptionCritical response=== While some critics found elements of the show enjoyable, many responses have focused on questions of historical accuracy, production value, and the length of the series, knowing it was to be first released around the world. John Serba's Decider episode one review notes that it covers a lot of history in a short time, with humorous remarks like mentioning that Simón is \\"not yet 13, but will be by the end of the episode\\" and suggesting that \\"[a]t this rate, we'll get back to the revolution in about 30 or 40 episodes\\". Despite this, Serba was impressed at the money and care put into the show, describing the detail of the soldiers' uniforms and the many background extras in every scene. He settles on calling the show \\"a soap opera at heart\\", and notes that though \\"[t]he production isn't chintzy like a soap opera, [the] 60 episodes must have been cranked out in a similarly quick, efficient manner\\" – though he writes that the most soap opera-like element is its \\"uber- melodramatic tone\\". Serba commends the historical accuracy, but worries that the necessary commitment to 60 episodes may be off-putting for U.S. and UK audiences, who are used to much shorter series and miniseries. On the Decider rating scale, which is either \\"skip it\\" or \\"stream it\\" (based on video-on- demand terminology), Serba concludes that it is worth it to \\"stream it\\". Kahron Spearman for The Daily Dot was less complimentary. He establishes various historical views of Bolívar and says that \\"his story deserves an abundance of space, depth, and dignity\\", criticizing Netflix and Caracol for different elements of the production that he sees as preventing this, including their decision that \\"an unreasonable 60-episode schedule was something the people required\\". Compared to Serba, Spearman believes that there was not enough money and care given to the series, and that a shorter run with the same budget would have allowed them to pay more attention to detail; he also comments that so much of the budget was spent on grand orchestral music for even mundane moments that it \\"proves bloated and silly\\", and begins to criticize the dialogue writing before suggesting \\"lazy translations\\" have muddied this aspect of the show. He does say that the acting is \\"stronger\\" than he expected from a telenovela, and specifically congratulated Abreu for \\"manag[ing] to humanize Bolívar to a great extent\\", but still concludes that the show's production values and telenovela style make it difficult to watch, especially with a \\"laborious\\" 60 episodes of 50 minutes each to be viewed. An article on the series by famous Venezuelan historian Inés Quintero at analysis aggregator Prodavinci shared some of the same concerns as Spearman, styling her criticism as an argument against the biographical historical drama genre in general through examples of the show, calling it \\"a story, not history\\" and saying that while its lack of production value doesn't help, \\"the fundamental reason\\" for her to not like the show is a pretense of historical accuracy when its true intentions are \\"to entertain and engage\\". Quintero suggests that choosing the flashbacks of the first episode were a tactic used to make the viewers' first image of Bolívar be that of a revolutionary hero, rather than a boy, and accuses the show of creating characters as more interesting and diverse than the real people. Ecuadorian newspaper El Universo and their media reviewer \\"Mr Smith\\" moved away from historical accuracy and reviewed the show as a work of television. Smith said he \\"forgives\\" Gómez, the child Simón, for his character, as he had to deal with the \\"uninteresting\\" writing of the first few episodes, and commends the other Bolívars, Barreto and Abreu, for their \\"remarkable job reflecting the eccentricities, convictions and boldness, as well as the sensitivity\\" of the character. Smith questions why the childhood years were not left out or only included in flashbacks, especially as they serve little to the plot, but writes that \\"[t]he art direction is pure quality\\" enough to make him interested in the period where history books have failed. Reviewing more of the series than his counterparts, Smith also describes the chemistry between Abreu and Nadan, who plays the third iteration of Bolívar's lover Manuela Sáenz, positively. Juancho Parada for El Tiempo questioned if the series was necessary, saying that it was only created for the bicentennial of Colombia's independence and criticizing almost every element of its production and storytelling, as well as saying that the promotional tour was too short to gather interest. Parada suggests that there are other films and series made about Bolívar that are better in terms of production and accuracy that audiences could already watch. === Popular response === Shany Nadan has received honors in her home country for her depiction of Manuela Sáenz; both are Ecuadorian The public response to the show was seen as very positive in Latin America, but it was not as well appreciated in the United States; Semana suggests that this is because of the 60-episode format that is unfamiliar to many of these viewers and seen as too long. However, Abreu thinks that the show was relatively popular worldwide based on his own measurement scale, saying that he is \\"full of pride\\" that \\"on Wikipedia, the first month it aired, it [Bolívar] was among the most searched words\\". A former mayor of the Ecuadorian city Guayaquil, Jaime Nebot, watched the show and enjoyed the performance of Guayaquil-born actress Shany Nadan so much that he recommended her to the current mayor, Cynthia Viteri, to be given an official honor. She received the medal of Guayaquil at the time and then, shortly before the Colombian broadcast of the show, was named Tourism Ambassador of Ecuador by President Lenín Moreno. ===Maduro criticism=== first inauguration was celebrated with a giant banner of Bolívar Before the series premiered, it was heavily criticised by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was angry about potential defamation, wanting to preserve Bolívar's image and tell everyone that Bolívar was Venezuelan, not Colombian, saying the other country was \\"running a hate campaign\\". Abreu, who plays the adult Bolívar in the show, responded to this comment by saying \\"You will have to watch it first before saying if you like it or not, and we will accept that opinion then, that is what free speech is\\"; he also said: \\"I think you have issues that are much, much more important to deal with, though\\". Nadan, playing the adult Manuela Sáenz, responded more diplomatically by saying that \\"everyone is free to view the series in their own way\\". In August 2019, Maduro apologized for his comments and congratulated the actors for their performances. Analyzing Maduro's criticism, historian Omar Galíndez spoke to BBC Mundo, suggesting that Maduro's \\"excessive zeal\\" to control the narrative surrounding Bolívar comes from a Chavist skepticism; that Hugo Chávez' revolution used the ideals and legendary status of Bolívar for its political gain, which, while highly criticized, forms the ideological basis for Maduro's power and support. Diario Las Américas has also stated that they believe Maduro's statements came from a place of wanting sole guardianship of Bolívar's image and a fear of Colombia and the United States using the show to try and overthrow him, additionally noting the politically-sensitive time of its release. One media writer to mention political context, though not acknowledging concern that the show could be politically-motivated, was Brett White, in a series overview; he agrees with Abreu's response, linking to the Wikipedia page about the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis in a comment saying that he doesn't have space to explain, \\"but let's just say that Maduro has a lot more to be worried about than a Netflix series.\\" Semana described Maduro's criticism of the show as an example of the Streisand effect; by discrediting it before it was even released, he interested more people in Latin America in watching it. BBC Mundo wrote in July 2019 that \\"Maduro's statement dominated the first reviews\\" of the show. In his review of the first episode, John Serba of Decider comments on Maduro's response, noting that Bolívar liberated more than just Venezuela. In Kahron Spearman's highly critical The Daily Dot review, he says that \\"[i]t's not often that a Netflix series creates political strife\\", as Maduro's accusations of Colombia had, but assured that though Maduro worried about the series disrespecting Bolívar, \\"[t]hat's not what he needed to be concerned about\\", slating the show for its quality and humorously adding that \\"Maduro had a point\\". In their medium-focused review, El Universo jokes that they will leave accuracy criticisms to the experts or to \\"the fan that is President Maduro, who has already made a few comments\\". == Television broadcast == The entire first season was first released on streaming service Netflix on 21 June 2019; the series went to air in Colombia on 18 September 2019. In September 2019 before the show began broadcasting in Colombia, members of its cast took a press tour around the country to promote it. A launch party was held in Cali. === Episodes === The episodes shown on Netflix and in Colombia have differences. Additionally, on Netflix, the episodes are untitled. ==Awards and nominations== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! Year ! Award ! Category ! Recipient !

The pediments of the Parthenon are the two sets of statues (around fifty) in Pentelic marble originally located on the east and west facades of the Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens. They were likely made by several artists, including Agoracritos. The master builder was likely Phidias. Thanks to Pausanias, a Greek geographer, the themes of these pediments are known: to the east, the birth of Athena, and to the west the quarrel between her and Poseidon to become the tutelary deity of Athens. The pediments were very damaged by time and military conflicts. Considered the archetype of classical sculpture, or even the embodiment of ideal Beauty, several of the statues were removed from the building by Lord Elgin's agents in the early nineteenth century and transported to the British Museum in London. Some statues and many fragments are kept at the Acropolis Museum in Athens. ==Construction== A modern quarry on Mt. Pentelikon. The accounts of the construction of the Parthenon make it possible to know that the marble intended for the pediments began to be extracted from the quarries of Mount Pentelikon in 439-438 BC.; sculpture work starting the following year. The accounts also show that excavation and transportation expenses were annual. This could mean that different quarries would have been used each year to obtain the highest possible quality marble The last marble purchases in the quarries are recorded in 434 BC. In the logic of the construction of the building, the sculptures of the pediments had to be installed almost at the very end (before the installation of the roof), probably in 432 BC. Since Adolf Michaelis in 1871, the statues are designated from left to right by a letter: from A to W for the western pediment and from A to P for the eastern pediment. Pausanias regularly informs about the authors of the works he describes.He thus attributes the pediments of the temple of Zeus at Olympia to Alcamenes pupil of Phidias those of the temple of Heracles at Thebes to Praxiteles or those of the temple of Apollo at Delphi to Praxias and Androsthenes. However, he gives no information on the \\"author\\" of the Parthenon pediments. A master builder for each of the pediments may even be possible Due to the size of the construction site (about fifty carved statues in half a dozen years), many artists must have worked there, as the differences of style and techniques show. Thus, the western pediment seems more refined, more \\"artificial\\" (almost mannerist) than the eastern pediment. It is possible that there was one artist per statue or group of statues. The accounts of 434-433 indicate that the sculptors were paid 16,392 drachmas. It is difficult to know, however, whether this is the total wage or the salary for that year alone. For comparison, the total cost of each of the (much smaller) pediments of Asclepius Temple in Epidaurus was 3,010 drachmas. Robert Spenser Stanier proposed in 1953 an estimate of 17 talents for pediments and acroterions. The statues are the largest pediment statues made in classical Greece and they are almost all in one piece . In addition, they were sculpted in the round. The same care was accorded to the front and the back, though the latter is hidden. It is possible that they were \\"exposed\\" on the site while waiting to be mounted on the Parthenon. The artists would then have chosen to finish them in their entirety. Nevertheless, the finish depends on the statues, and therefore the sculptors. On some, details, invisible from the ground were left unfinished, while on others, this was not the case. In addition, it was necessary to plane the back of some (west A for example) to make them fit their designated place. Deep rectangular grooves at the corners of pediments could indicate the presence in these places of a lift-type mechanism for mounting statues. Above the Doric frieze (triglyphs and metopes) was an overhanging horizontal cornice of twenty-five blocks of marble. The ranking cornices were surmounted by a painted sima (palmettes and golden lotus flowers). Thus was delimited a long space of 28.35 m and high (in its center) of 3.428 m or 3.47 m to a depth of 0.90 m. All the statues were installed on the horizontal cornice which exceeded in overhanging of 70 cm, placed either on a plinth or on a laying bed. To install the statue is G, the cornice had to be dug out. The pediments of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, about twenty years older, and seem to have been a major influence for the realization of the pediments of the Parthenon. The dimensions are relatively equivalent: 3.44 meters high to a depth of 1 meter at Olympia. In order to make them more visible, because of the angle of vision, some of the statues were inclined outwards, as in Olympia, and sometimes up to 30 cm above the void. Even the sitting statues had their feet protruding from the edge. The fixing systems (dowels and spikes) of the statues at the horizontal cornice were nearly the same in Athens and Olympia. However, for the heaviest (in the center), the Parthenon sculptors had to innovate. They were held by iron props that sank to one side in the plinth of the statue and the other deep in the horizontal cornice and tympanum. These \\"L\\" props made the weight of the statue cantilevered on the cornice. ==Description== The pediments of the Parthenon included many statues. The one to the west had a little more than the one to the east. In the description of the Acropolis of Athens by Pausanias, a sentence informs about the chosen themes: the quarrel between Athena and Poseidon for Attica in the west and the birth of Athena in the east. This is the only evocation in the ancient literature of the Parthenon's decoration. In addition, the traveler gives no detail outside the general theme while he describes in a very precise way the pediments of the temple of Zeus in Olympia. Perhaps he considered the Panhellenic sanctuary of the Peloponnese to be more important than the Parthenon, the latter perhaps being too \\"local\\", or simply Athenian. The number of statues and the very precise myths evoked makes Bernard Ashmole wonder if the contemporaries themselves were really capable of identifying all the characters. ===West Pediment=== Proposed reconstruction of the west pediment at the Acropolis Museum, Athens. To the west, on the \\"minor\\" facade, was the quarrel between Athena and Poseidon for Athens and Attica and the victory of the Virgin Goddess, one of the great local myths. The two divinities disputed sovereignty over the region. They decided to offer the most beautiful gifts to win. With one blow of his trident, the god of the seas caused a spring (or a lake) of salty water to spring up on the acropolis. The virgin goddess with a spearhead made the first olive tree appear. The sources do not agree on the identity of the referees. They chose Athena and her olive tree. This story is first recounted by Herodotus (VIII, 55). This myth had hitherto been little represented: the artist who conceived the ensemble, as well as the sculptors, had a complete freedom. In the central space, the two gods (Athena on the left, West L, Poseidon on the right, West M) were perhaps separated by the olive tree of Athena or even the lightning of Zeus. The representation on this pediment of an intervention of Zeus in the quarrel could be the first occurrence of this theme. It is then found on a vase from the end of the fifth century BC. preserved in the archaeological museum of Pella and in literature. Iris (west N). It is difficult to determine where the gift of the two gods could be represented: emerging from the ground at the end of their weapon (lance for Athena and trident for Poseidon) or the olive tree well in the center of the pediment, with the sacred serpent of Athena wrapped around. It seems that Poseidon's torso was used as a model for the Triton (mythology) that adorn the Odeon of Agrippa in the agora. The violence of the divine confrontation can be read in the tension of the tense bodies which are recoiling backward, as in the famous group Athena and Marsyas of Myron, dedicated on the acropolis a few years earlier. The movement also recalls that of the South metope XXVII. Then came the chariots (Biga) and their female charioteers. Nike (west G) leads that of Athena, but the statue has completely disappeared. Amphitrite (west O) is the usual charioteer of the sea god: on the drawing attributed to Carrey, she is identifiable thanks to the sea serpent at her feet,Fragments of this snake were found and identified in the 1980s: they are kept at the Acropolis Museum in Athens. but she is found occupying this function elsewhere in the art and perhaps is on one of the east metopes. Amphitrite wears a peplos with a wide belt worn very high, just under the chest. The garment is open on the left side, floating behind in the wind, leaving the leg bare. The rearing horses allow an ideal occupation of the space between the cornices. The Auriga are accompanied by the messenger gods: Hermes (west H) on the side of Athena and Nike; Iris (west N) of the other. The head of Hermes disappeared between 1674 (drawing attributed to Carrey) and 1749 (drawing of Richard Dalton: he looked no longer the quarrel?, but already behind him. The bust of Iris was identified through the square holes at the shoulder blades, where her wings were originally attached. She wears a short tunic that the wind sticks to the forms of her body that can be divined in multiple folds. The tunic was retained by a thin belt, added in bronze and since lost. After this large central group, the tension drops and the poses of the statues are calmer. On the left side were various characters from the Attic mythology whose identifications are discussed. The general theme of the pediment being a purely local myth, it is often surmised that Athenian heroes should be represented. The western figures D, E and F have disappeared. The west group B and C is very damaged. Snake fragments (a snake or the tail of the male figure) suggest that it could be Cecrops and his daughter Pandrosus. On the right side, two seated women carry children: west Q holds two babies (west P and R), it could be Orithyia the daughter of Erechtheus, carrying the two sons she had of Boreas Calais and Zetes West T has an older child on the knees (west S). The western U and V statues are highly damaged and fragmentary but do not appear to form a group. The first figure on the left, male, (west A) and the last on the right, female, (west W) are symmetrical. By analogy with the pediments of Olympia, river deities have been identified: Ilissos or Cephis on the left and perhaps Callirrhoe on the right. The statue of the Ilissos is of very high quality in its rendering of the anatomical details and in its movement: it seems to be extracted from the ground while turning towards the central scene. The composition of this pediment is inspired by that of the eastern pediment of Olympia. The idea of simple \\"spectator\\" statues sitting on the exteriors and then of river gods was also borrowed from the sanctuary in the Peloponnese. The western statues B, C, L, Q and perhaps W have been copied and adapted to adorn one of the pediments of the temple of Eleusis (smaller than that of the Parthenon), completed in the second century and representing the abduction of Persephone.

File:Fronton ouest sud.jpgalt=Dessin sépia : statues encadrées dans un triangleDrawing attributed to Jacques Carrey : west pediment, south part. ===East Pediment=== Proposed reconstruction of the east pediment in the Acropolis Museum, Athens. The east pediment, on the most sacred facade, evokes the birth of Athena before the other gods together, a theme already developed in the decor of ceramics, but never yet in sculpture. However, we know little about it because it disappeared very early, when the Parthenon was transformed into a church in the seventh or eighth century. In the center was enthroned Zeus, probably seated, his eagle at his feet. In fact, there remain traces of three large metal supports of a very heavy statue: Zeus was then seated, either on his throne or on a rock at the top of Olympus. Near him were to be Athena, of course, but also Hera and obviously? Hephaestus and Ilithyia Other statues are poorly identified. Various fragments preserved in the museum of the Acropolis of Athens certainly come from this pediment. The \\"Wegner peplophoros\\" (consisting of the fragments MAcr 6711 and MAcr 6712) could have been Hera. Similarly, the torso fragment MAcr 880 could correspond to the figure is H and may have been Hephaestus. Further, on each side, new grooves for retaining blades suggest again a very heavy statue, perhaps a biga, even if the presence of chariots here has no narrative justification; moreover, chariots (of gods) are present at the corners. In addition, the decor of a Roman well of the first century (Putéal de la Moncloa) preserved in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain evokes the presence of Moirai. As it seems to owe much to the Parthenon pediment, these deities could also attend the birth of Athena. here. Outside the central action, the other deities on the pediment seem to make only the \\"act of presence.\\" The left end, on the south, is the best-preserved. A standing female figure (designated G) walks away from the central action she is looking at. She is dressed in a peplos and approaches two other female figures (east E and F), sitting on folded cloths placed on chests (detail only visible from behind). The proposed interpretation is that it would be Demeter and her daughter Kore. To their left and with his back to them, a male figure (east D) is lying on a leopard's skin on a rock. This is Dionysus. He is very athletic and has his legs apart. This young Dionysus, who is also on the east side of the frieze, may well be the first example of the change in the representation of this god. While he was previously portrayed in the guise of a rude old man, this youthful and turbulent version was then imposed on iconography. The god seems to salute the chariot of Helios rising from the end of the pediment. The right end, to the north, has retained only a group of three women (east K, L and M). The work of the sculptors is of very high quality, mainly in the play of drapery. It is most often attributed to Agoracritos. East K is from the front. East M is carelessly lying on her neighbor east L. The trio has not been identified. However, the pattern of the chiton slipping subtly revealing the shoulder is seen here on east K and M. It is also on west C, identified with Pandrosus and the representation of Artemis on the eastern frieze. This sensual gesture could also be attributed to Aphrodite. At the very end, the chariot of the Moon or Night seems to descend through the bottom of the pediment.

File:Fronton est nord.jpgalt=Dessin sépia : statues encadrées dans un triangleDrawing attributed to Jacques Carrey : east pediment, north part. ==History== Cyriacus of Ancona in 1436 : first historical representation of the building. This is probably the west pediment that is partially depicted, and reinvented. Block 19 of the eastern pediment's horizontal cornice was damaged and repaired in Roman times, but there is no evidence of restoration work on a statue. At the time of the transformation of the Parthenon into a church, somewhere in the sixth or the seventh century, the statues of the center of the eastern pediment were deposited to make way for the apse. In the first half of the fifteenth century, Cyriac d'Ancona during one of his visits to Athens drew one of the pediments, probably that of the west. He represents only a carriage, probably that of Athena: that of Poseidon would have already disappeared, without his fate being known. In 1674, an artist in the service of the Marquis de Nointel (French ambassador to the Sublime Porte), perhaps Jacques Carrey, depicted the west pediment which lacks the chariot of the god of the seas and a few heads, including that of Athena. The pediment was already very damaged. During the siege of Athens, by the Venetians commanded by Francesco Morosini, on September 26, 1687 the explosion of the powder reserve installed in the Parthenon greatly damaged the pediments. The blast caused some of the statues to fall and others to be out of balance, making a fall possible. Morosini was then ordered by the Venetian Senate to return to the Serenissima the \\"work of art considered the most important and the most refined.\\" He decided to take some sculptures from the western pediment, probably the left-wing chariot, that of Athena. However, his men were ill- equipped and the statues crashed to the ground early in 1688. Only one female head (the Weber-Laborde head) found its way to Venice. In the same way, part of the head of one of the horses of Athena's chariot traveled to the Vatican. The fate of the other fragments varied: some were used as building material for houses built on the acropolis; others were bought by European collectors passing through Athens during their Grand Tour. Excavations organized by the Greek state in the 1830s and 1840s brought to light many fragments. The west group B and C is very damaged because it remained on the Parthenon until 1977, as was the western female figure W. The western group B and C (probably Cecrops and Pandrose) was not swept away by the agents of Lord Elgin at the beginning of the nineteenth century because they believed that it was a repair of the first centuries of our era that had replaced the original group by a statue tribute to the emperor Hadrian and his wife Sabine. This erroneous assumption was made at the end of the seventeenth century in Jacob Spon's (1678) and George Wheler (1682). travel narratives. The head of the chariot horse Helios, east C, was removed from the Parthenon in 1988. ==Conservation== The two pediments included about fifty statues. Only one, identified as Dionysus on the east side, kept his head. All others have disappeared or been dispersed across Europe. The statues are preserved in the British Museum, the Acropolis Museum in Athens and the Louvre Museum (Weber-Laborde head). Much of what remains of the western pediment is in the British Museum. Busts (very damaged) of Athena, Poseidon, Amphitrite, Hermes and Iris (West L, M, O, H and N) are preserved. A fragment of the helmet of the virgin goddess and the front of the bust of the sea god are on the other hand in the museum of the Acropolis, with fragments of the marine snake which was at the foot of Poseidon's wife. The statues of the pediments are considered the archetype of classical sculpture. ==NotesReferencesBibliography== *John Boardman, Greek Sculpture : The Classical Period a handbook, London, Thames and Hudson, 1985 *John Boardman, Greek Art, London John Boardman (trad.

Itkind's favorite style was wooden sculptures of people. The uniqueness of Itkind's creativity was in his genius to “see a soul in the wooden slob” as he often relayed to his creations. \\"To Isaac Itkind it is important that his sculptures should think and should stimulate thought\\". The famous artist, Marc Chagall, a personal friend of Itkind, once said: “ Itkind is the Van Gogh of sculpture”. After the Soviet revolution, the tragic events of the Great Purge threw Itkind's life into oblivion - and his masterpieces followed for decades. He was falsely declared dead in 1937. Itkind's long and unique life – full of tragic events – nourished his genius creativity. (Honored Artist of the Kazakh SSR (1968), member of the Union of Artists of the USSR). ==Early life== Isaac Itkind claimed that he was born in 1871 in the town of Smarhon', in the Vilnius province of the Russian Empire. Similar to his father, he was a Hassidic rabbi teaching Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). The turning point in his life was accidental when, at age of 26, he discovered a book about the famous sculptor Mark Antokolsky. Itkind was so impressed by the sculptures of Antokolsky that he started chiseling and sculpting himself. This new “hobby” was inappropriate for the rabbi and disapproved by his family and neighbors. Then a travel journalist, Peretz Hirshbein, wrote an article about the unique gift of self- taught Isaac to the newspaper, which made Itkind famous and eventually brought him to Vilno (now Vilnius) where in 1910 he joined the drawing school with distinguished artist Ferdynand Ruszczyc. In 1911, Itkind moved to Moscow, Russia, where he was accepted by famous sculptor Sergei Volnukhin to study in his workshop at the School of Sculpture and Architecture in 1912-1913. == Self-taught Sculptor (1905 – 1916) == Itkind's early works were predominantly dedicated to the portraits and scenes of small Jewish towns. Itkind's first publish exhibition – in Vilno in 1915 – included his wooden works “Victims of Inquisition,” “Padre,” “Bitter Laughter,” “The Smiling Jew,” “The Crazy Man,” and “Noah’s Arch.” (The newspaper “North-West Voice,” «Северо-западный голос» Jan 1, 1915) == Early Career (1916-1937) == The works performed by Itkind before 1918 were devoted to the theme of grief (\\"Bitter laughter,” \\"The Crazy Man,” and \\"Moralist\\"). His favorite material was wood. Itkind's sculptures impressed the famous Russian Soviet writer Maxim Gorky, who in 1918 organized the first Itkind personal art exhibition in Soviet Russia (in the Jewish theater Habima). Of the 42 sculptures presented at 1918 exhibition, only three survived until today: \\"Father\\"(sometimes named “Self-portrait,” in private collection), \\"Humpbacked\\" ( in private collection), \\"Jewish Melody\\" (The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg) . After the Revolution, Issac Itkind joined Mark Chagall as a teacher in the Moscow labor colony \\"III International\\" near Moscow for homeless children in Malakhovka. Between 1917-1937 he had three personal art exhibitions in Moscow and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and participated in another 18 exhibitions with other artists. In 1927, Itkind moved to Leningrad where he created works devoted to various historical and cultural figures: portraits of Lenin, F. Lassalle, K. Marx, F. Engels, and many portraits of the famous Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. At the exhibition dedicated to the 15th Anniversary of Soviet Sculpture Itkind presented his famous “ Victims of fascism pogrom: the head of the composer Matz, killed by “browns”, 1927, (now in The State Russian Museum, St Petersburg) His prolific contribution to the Art Exhibition in Hermitage dedicated to 100 years of death of Pushkin in 1937 included 100 pieces of sculptures. The sculpture “Dying Pushkin” won the first prize. Isaac Itkind was famous in the USSR and abroad. His masterpieces were bought by famous art collectors, such as Savva Mamontov, prior to the revolution and later by famous people visiting the USSR, including French businessman Leon Blum and brother of Theodore Roosevelt. It was a known fact that both Blum and Roosevelt tried to persuade Itkind to leave USSR and move to the West by offering him help, but Itkind refused. In the 1920-30s Itkind was considered a living genius along with Chagall and Picasso, and one of the leading Russian sculptors of 20th century along with Sergej Konenkov and Stepan Erzia. After the exhibition in France in 1937, Itkind was arrested by the KGB, and then was announced dead in the same year. == Social Life in 1912-1936. == Many famous poets, writers and artists such as Maxim Gorky, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Sergej Konenkov, Maximilian Voloshin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Sergej Yesenin, Aleksey Tolstoy, and Mark Chagall, became close friends of Itkind and adored his creativity. Itkind was a remarkable storyteller and writer. From his oral stories, famous writers and directors – Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Sergei Yesenin, Vsevolod Meyerhold, persuaded Itkind to start writing. Alexey Tolstoy in 1934 published several Itkind's storied in the popular \\"Star\\" magazine. == 1937-1969 == In 1937, after an exhibition of Itkind's sculpture “Pushkin in Chains” in Paris, France, Itkind was arrested for Japanese espionage and placed into the jail Kresty, where he was beaten, his ribs were broken and eardrums ruptured. Soon after, he was exiled to Siberia, and later to Kazakhstan. The whole world until 1944 believed that Itkind was killed or died in the camps in 1937, it was this date of death that was indicated in the signatures to his sculptures and in literature. Since 1938, Isaak Itkind lived in the village Zerenda, Kazakhstan, in profound poverty. http://www.pkzsk.info/isaak-itkind-skulptor- voskresshij-v-kazaxstane/ At the same time, no one knew that \\"a half-savage old sorcerer eating roots, living in a dugout and collecting old stumps\\" was a world-famous sculptor. In 1944 with the help of brave people, who under the risk of being accused with helping “an enemy of the people,” Itkind moved to Alma-Ata (now Alma-Aty), the capital of Kazakhstan that time. Not much is known about Itkind's life until 1956. === Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, 1956–1969 === In 1956 Itkind got a job in the Alma-Ata State Theater as a decorator during the daytime, and at night chiseled sculptures from wood in the basement of the theater. During his time in Alma-Ata Itkind created sculptural portraits of famous and simple Kazakh people “Akyn Dzhambul”, “Amangeldy”, “Abay”. Two years later, in 1958, the new young theater artist decided to examine the basement of the theater, where he discovered portraits and compositions that later became famous: “Paul Robeson” (1956), “The Tree-Thinker “(1956), “The Laughing Old Man” (1958), “\\"Song\\"” (1960). Nearly all Itkind’s sculptures created in Kazakhstan are currently in The A. Kasteyev State Museum of Arts in Almaty, Kazakhstan. According to some memoirs, approximately a year prior to his death, Isaac Itkind stopped carving and returned to his religious roots, as he was spending all days sitting with kipa on his head and reading Tanakh (Jewish Bible). He died in the city of Alma-Ata in 1969. Some works of Isaac Itkind are publicly exhibited and some are kept in Russia’s museums: The State Russian Museum and The National Pushkin Museum in St. Petersburg, as well as in the museums of Kazakhstan, France and the USA. During his life, Isaac Itkind was known to generously present his sculptures to acquaintances and friends, therefore, the majority of his works created before 1956 are either lost or in private collections. In 1967, a young filmmaker from Kazakhstan, Ararat Mashanov, produced a 20-minute documentary about Itkind \\"Touching Eternity”. == References == * Category:1871 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Russian people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:Russian male sculptors ","title":"Isaac Itkind"},{"id":"56786243","text":"Marcus Daniel Cronin (9 January 1865 – 12 August 1936) was a United States military officer.

Anders performed 2 of 14 Historic ocean rows listed by Ocean Rowing Society, the official Guinness Adjudicator for ocean rowing. He was the first to row the Indian Ocean, the first to row on the Pacific solo, and the fastest ocean rower of his times. == Ocean Rowing  Historic Ocean Rows === Two ocean rows completed by Anders Svedlund were unassisted and unsupported, undertaken without water makers, without sat phones, without GPS, EPIRB or liferafts; conditions which are described by Ocean Rowing Society as \\"not much different from the days of Columbus\\", defining historic ocean rowers as \\"test pilots, but without a parachute\\". === Indian Ocean === In 1971 Anders Svedlund became the first to row the Indian Ocean from Kalbarri, Western Australia to a beach of Ankirikiriky, near Diego Suarez, Madagascar, taking 64 days in a boat called Roslagen, covering a distance of 4313 miles (3748 Nautical Miles or 6941 km), achieving average speed of 2,44 Knots (2,81Mph or 4,52 km/h). It was the fastest average speed achieved on any ocean up to date. The ocean was successfully crossed again by a solo rower over 30 years later in 2003. The overall speed record on the Indian Ocean was only broken by a team, over 40 years later in 2014 and has never been broken by a solo rower despite the attempts undertaken in newly designed, vastly technologically-advantaged boats. Svedlund's is the second longest standing ocean rowing speed record after the record of Frank Samuelsen and George Harbo. Anders Svedlund's boat, Roslagen, later renamed to Waka Moana, was the fastest boat in ocean rowing history from 1971 to 1992, when higher overall speed was finally achieved on the Atlantic Ocean by the 11 men team La Mondiale. Higher speed by a solo rower was achieved 31 years later (2002) on the relatively less challenging route, Atlantic Ocean Trade Winds I. === Pacific Ocean === thumb Anders Svedlund Ocean Rowing Anders Svedlund Ocean Rowing Three years later in 1974 he became the first solo rower to row on the Pacific, still in the same boat renamed to Waka Moana from Chilie to West Samoa via Tahiti. The journey took him 191 days and covered 6462 Miles (5615 Nautical Miles or 10400 km). Upon his arrival in Tahiti he was welcomed by Marie-Therese Danielsson, wife of Bengt Danielsson, a crew member on the Kon Tiki raft expedition, who wrote an article on Anders for Pacific Islands Monthly in April 1983. Danielsson retrospectively titled Anders \\"The Great Pacific Rower\\", as by that time there were many other attempts made to row the Pacific that the achievement of Anders could be compared to. == Approach to expeditions == Svedlund seemed to care very little for records, shunned all publicity, and never kept a log or wrote down the story of his accomplishments. After rowing across the Indian Ocean, he went straight back to Auckland, and, without telling a soul where he had been, resumed his old trade as a house painter. In his “journals” he didn't write about risks and difficulties. His journals (when found) were full of his inner disputes on philosophical, existential and spiritual dilemmas. For him rowing seemed to be a mystical quest, and any achievement was a by- product of the journey. When asked about the biggest difficulties of ocean rowing, Anders would mention: “The one thing I regret is that she heaves and rolls so much that it is absolutely impossible to stand on my head for any length of time. To function normally one must stand on one's head for at least an hour a day”. Anders was asked whether he was ever bored not having radio or books on board of his boat. He would answer that \\"the sea offered a splendid, ever-changing spectacle” It actually made him so happy that he often burst into song. Mostly he sang old Swedish folk songs he had learned as a child. == Personal life == Anders was a teetotaler and a vegetarian. == Legacy == A section of Maritime Museum in Auckland is dedicated to Anders Svedlund. \\"Mariners Book Of Days\\" dedicated one day to Anders Svedlund. == References == Category:1926 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Ocean rowers Category:Sports world record holders Category:Swedish explorers Category:Swedish male rowers ","title":"Anders Svedlund"},{"id":"56786430","text":"LoveLaws is the debut studio album by the American musician Theresa Wayman.

After she \\"dabbled in guitar\\" as a teenager, Wayman \\"got really serious\\" about music and songwriting, learning both guitar and drums by 21-years old. In 2004 she formed the indie rock band Warpaint in Los Angeles, California, with whom she released three studio albums—The Fool (2010), Warpaint (2014) and Heads Up (2016)—to critical acclaim. In 2010 Wayman began the process of composing and recording solo material by \\"daydreaming about making music\\" using ideas that were \\"brewing since [she] was a teenager\\". She subsequently began learning to use the digital audio workstation Logic Pro by Apple, utilizing the application's drum machines and creating loops. Among the earliest tracks written by Wayman was an embryonic version of \\"The Dream\\". Since Wayman was not signed to a record label as a solo artist, she was \\"free to experiment in whichever direction [she] wanted to\\" with her initial ideas for LoveLaws, as there was no release deadline to meet. She subsequently spent a further eight years writing and recording ideas for the album, which she called a \\"luxury\\". Describing the situation, Wayman said: > \\"Usually I'm up against time and money [but] with this, I didn't have that > pressure. I did get to set things aside and wait to see how I felt about > them later; if they had a longer shelf life then I knew it was right.\\" ==Recording== LoveLaws was recorded intermittently over an eight-year period from 2010 to 2018 in various locations, including Wayman's home studio; House on the Hill, Warpaint's personal studio in downtown Los Angeles, California; and Mr. Dan's, Dan Careys studio in London, England. Wayman was the album's main producer, with further co-production from her brother Ivan and Carey, both of whom also performed as multi-instrumentalists. Ivan Wayman co-produced eight tracks; Carey co-produced two (\\"I've Been Fine\\" and \\"Too Sweet\\"). Beastie Boys collaborator Mark Ramos Nishita (Money Mark) was brought in by Wayman during the later sessions for the album. Instead of rearranging or reproducing the existing tracks, he and Wayman spent the sessions \\"just jamming\\", with Money Mark instead contributing \\"some really beautiful lines\\" that Wayman could then cut and paste throughout the album. Money Mark co- produced two tracks (\\"Love Leaks\\" and \\"Tutorial\\") and contributed electric piano on \\"Tutorial\\" and the synthesizer line in the chorus of \\"Love Leaks\\", which Wayman then further rearranged as the song's introduction. All three other members of Warpaint were also part of the LoveLaws recording process. \\"Take One\\" features bassist Jenny Lee Lindberg, who Wayman instructed \\"to go crazy\\" during the song's instrumental bridge; \\"Safe\\" features drummer Stella Mozgawa, who Wayman \\"asked for some input\\" and who contributed synthesizers and drum fills; and \\"Too Sweet\\" features vocalist Emily Kokal singing \\"made of a lover\\", a lyric previously used on the Warpaint song \\"Biggy\\" from the band's eponymous second studio album four years prior. Wayman spent the final year- and-a-half of the LoveLaws production taking \\"all the bits and pieces\\" produced since 2010 \\"and putting it together\\" with Ivan. \\"Safe\\", which begins with a dialogue between a man and a woman whose voices are reversed, was originally intended to include sampled dialogue from a scene in Alfred Hitchcocks 1954 film Rear Window. Wayman said \\"it matched up perfectly\\" and \\"felt like it had to be there\\", but was ultimately replaced by dialogue recorded by Pete Checkvala and Wayman. The final sessions with Ivan included the rerecording of several of the album's vocal tracks; the final song to be completed was \\"The Dream\\". LoveLaws was subsequently mixed by Ivan and Shawn Everett and mastered by Dave Cooley at Elysian Masters in Los Angeles. ==Composition== LoveLaws contains ten tracks, nine of which were written by Wayman. Of the nine tracks she penned, two were co-written with collaborators. \\"Mykki\\", the album's opener, was co-written with her brother Ivan Wayman and Joe Base; \\"Dram\\" was co-written with Ivan. One track (\\"Sassafras Interlude\\") was written and performed by Ludivine Anneliz, also known as \\"Sassafras\\". A multi-instrumentalist, Wayman performed several instruments on the album, including guitar, bass, synthesizers, samplers, piano, electric organ and both acoustic and digital drums. LoveLaws musical style has been noted for deviating from Wayman's \\"rather guitar-heavy roots\\" in Warpaint, with more of an emphasis on samples, \\"dark and moody synths\\", \\"sparse beats\\" and \\"Lynchian electronic noise\\"; Wayman herself has described the album as \\"a lot more electronic … and maybe more gentle\\" than Warpaint's sound. In particular, Wayman has cited the use of soundscapes by trip hop bands Portishead and Massive Attack as an influence on the album's sound, as well as soul artists Al Green and Sade, and the Icelandic musician Björk. Wayman dubbed the album's genre as \\"bedroom folk\\" while several publications have described it as downtempo, trip hop, electronica, and art pop. Wayman, although stressing she did not consider LoveLaws a work of ambient music, said that the album \\"fulfills the definition of ambient music in the sense that it's very mood driven and creates something to feel and think to and experience on a physical level.\\" Initially, Wayman wrote stream of consciousness-style lyrics for the songs on LoveLaws and avoided \\"revising music or lyrics in the pursuit of a raw, unfussy sound.\\" However, during the process of \\"polishing ideas\\" for the final versions, she reworked several lyrics, approaching them by \\"wondering about … how to reconcile these different aspects of my life that don't necessarily go together\\". Wayman claimed she wrote the album's lyrics \\"subconsciously straight forward\\", as she hoped to \\"be relatable and honest\\" as it was \\"something [she] really value[d].\\" Originally the songs on LoveLaws were \\"break-up ballads and aspirational love songs\\", which Wayman claims were her \\"romanticizing about having the perfect relationship when in real life, I wasn't able to have any relationship\\". Over the chorus of writing, the songs' subjects and themes \\"naturally expanded to include different influences\\", including motherhood, self-empowerment, and self-love. Wayman confirmed the overarching lyrical themes of LoveLaws as romantic love, but emphasised that \\"it's all kinds of facets of [love]\\", including platonic friendships and the concept of unconditional love, both \\"of the past and what [she had] been going through\\". Wayman's lyrics have been noted for their \\"emotional openness\\", which she herself commented on, claiming the album as a whole \\"evokes emotion more than being an intellectual album.\\" ==Release== LoveLaws was released on May 18, 2018 in the United States and Europe on LoveLeaks, Wayman's own imprint, and distributed by Caroline International. The album was made available for streaming and digital download on several online services and issued on CD in both regions. A limited-edition rose-colored gatefold LP was released only in Europe. A Japanese CD pressing was distributed by Hostess Entertainment Unlimited and included a bonus track, \\"So To Be Forgot\\". LoveLaws artwork was designed by Wayman, featuring photography by Delaram Pourabdi. Explaining the album's title, Wayman said she thought of it as \\"a good concept to build an album from. I was feeling ruled by love and romance, and also seeing love as being a fundamental of life in so many ways.\\" An album launch was held at Everyman Kings Cross in London four days prior to LoveLaws official release. Hosted by Pitchblack Play, a company who host album listening sessions in a pitch-black environment, the event included a question-and-answers session with Wayman. In further promotion of the album, Wayman performed online sessions for Baeble Music in the US, Revista Martin in Mexico, and Matches Fashion in England between March and October 2018. She also appeared as a guest and performed on BBC Radio 4s Woman's Hour. Three singles were released from LoveLaws. The lead single, \\"Love Leaks\\", was released on March 7, 2018—the day the album was announced. The second single, \\"I've Been Fine\\", was released on April 5 with an accompanying music video directed by both Wulf Anderson and Wayman. The third and final single, \\"The Dream\\", was released on May 4. Wayman made a conscious decision to not continuously tour in promotion of LoveLaws, citing the struggles of Warpaint's constant touring as a reason. She instead performed a small, six-date tour of England from May 17 to 23, 2018 supporting Nick Mulvey and performing a headline show at the Pickle Factory in London; the following week, LoveLaws placed at number 38 on the United Kingdom's Official Record Store Chart. Several small shows in California were subsequently announced between June and October, including appearances at MOCA Music at the Museum of Contemporary Art and Amoeba Music in Los Angeles. ==Reception== Upon its release LoveLaws received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 9 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Clash writer Josh Gray praised LoveLaws as \\"refreshingly honest\\"—in particular its lyrical \\"frankness\\" and \\"intimacy\\"—but criticized the album as \\"more of a messy entry scrawled across the pages of a personal diary than it is a pristine, thought-out postcard\\". Gray summarized that \\"occasionally [the album's] composition feels scrappy or unfinished, but this doesn’t particularly mar the experience of listening to it\\", rating it seven out of ten. In a four-out-of-five-star review for DIY, Lisa Wright drew comparisons to Warpaint's releases and said LoveLaws \\"feel familiar yet riddled with something slightly sadder\\", concluding that the album was \\"an even more personal exploration of [Wayman's] affective talents.\\" Hot Press rated LoveLaws six out of ten, with Sam Steiger writing that \\"the overall mood is claustrophobic—the aural equivalent of a deep-sea journey … Enveloped in icy, Stygian depths, the sounds resonate with exaggerated meaning\\"; Steiger called the resulting sound \\"cool, downbeat and languid.\\" Writing for The Line of Best Fit, Ross Horton referred to LoveLaws as \\"a resounding success\\", praised the album's \\"mastery of dynamics\\" and selected \\"The Dream\\" as the album's highlight, calling it \\"a groovy, down-tempo banger with thudding percussion sounds, densely layered atmospherics and Wayman's distinctive murmur\\"; Horton awarded the album a seven-out-of-ten rating. Loud and Quiet reviewer Tristan Gatward called LoveLaws \\"a resounding and devastating collection of songs about motherhood, loneliness and romance in an unromantic age\\" and \\"lyrically astute pop with shattering confessionalism\\", ultimately rating it eight out of ten. In a four-out-of-five-star review for NME, Andrew Trendell said LoveLaws was \\"so driven by Wayman's personality, vivid lyricism and adventurous flair that it deserves to exist within its own realm\\", praising the album's \\"crisp production and open-hearted approach\\" and further calling it \\"a record not only to be listened to from start to finish, but a 'headphones' album if ever there was one.\\" Katie Hawthorne of The Skinny rated the album four-out-of-five stars and said Wayman's \\"imagination is startling and singular\\". She referred to Wayman's songwriting as having a \\"slippery, shimmering quality\\", selecting \\"I've Been Fine\\", \\"Dram\\", \\"Safe\\" and \\"Too Sweet\\" as highlights from the album. In a three-out-of-five-star review for American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz noted the album's preference for \\"atmospheric programmed beats, synths, piano and bass\\" over Wayman's usual use of guitar, adding that the resulting sound was \\"often throbbing, sensual … augmented by suggestive lyrics.\\" Though further praising the album's \\"personal and riveting\\" lyrics and \\"enduring, durable and somewhat ageless vibe\\", Horowitz claimed LoveLaws \\"seems caught in a time warp of sorts\\" due to its \\"melodramatic tendencies\\" and \\"often creepy robot-on-narcotics sound\\". Q, in another three-out-of-five-star review, was similarly critical and said LoveLaws \\"feels like an act of introspection that's gone too far, one that might have benefited from a breath of fresh air, a trip outside its head.\\" ==Track listingPersonnel== All personnel credits adapted from LoveLaws album notes. ;Performers *Theresa Wayman – vocals , synthesizer , guitar , bass , piano , drum machine , drums , sampler , Hammond organ *Ivan Wayman – synthesizer , strings , drums , drum machine *Joe Bates – vocals *Dan Carey – drum machine , guitar , Swarmatron , synthesizer *Guro Gikling – bass *Money Mark – harmonium , synthesizer , percussion , electric piano *Alex Belmonte – guitar *Stella Mozgawa – drums , synthesizer *Anjolee Williams – additional vocals *Pete Checkvala – additional vocals *Graeme Blevins – clarinet *Ludivine Anneliz (\\"Sassafras\\") – vocals, guitar *Jenny Lee Lindberg – bass *Emily Kokal – additional vocals ;Technical personnel *Theresa Wayman – production, arrangement *Ivan Wayman – production , arrangement , mixing *Dan Carey – production , arrangement *Money Mark – production *Hal Ritson – additional production , additional programming *Richard Adlam – additional programming *Shawn Everett – mixing *Dave Cooley – mastering ;Design personnel *Theresa Wayman – design, artwork *Delaram Pourabdi – photography ==Chart positions== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2018) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" UK Record Store (OCC)  38 } ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Region ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" Label ! scope=\\"col\\" Distributor ! scope=\\"col\\" Catalog - ! scope=\\"row\\" United States  rowspan=\\"3\\" May 18, 2018   rowspan=\\"3\\" LoveLeaks  rowspan=\\"2\\" Caroline International  2567450801 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Europe   LL001 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan  CD  Hostess Entertainment Unlimited  HSU-10188 } ==ReferencesCategory:2018 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Dan Carey (record producer) Category:Art pop albums Category:Downtempo albums Category:Trip hop albums by American artists ","title":"LoveLaws"},{"id":"56786498","text":"Yassin Bouih (born 24 November 1996) is an Italian middle-distance runner competing primarily in the 1500 metres.

The film was written and directed by St. Charles native, Nicholas Smith. ==Plot== In St. Charles, IL, during the town's scarecrow fest, four teenagers (Joe, Corey, Scott and Rachel), two high school couples, take their SUV down to Munger Road to test the local urban legend that if a car is parked on the train tracks, the spirits of children who died in a school bus-train collision will push the car off the tracks to help them to avoid being hit by a train. Simultaneously, a convicted killer escapes from his transport to another jail and goes on a murder spree. Two police officers in town look to capture the killer without disturbing the town festival. The teenagers, back at their vehicle, test to see if the children will push their SUV by dusting the bumper with baby powder. The teenage girls are momentarily tricked by their boyfriends into believing that the spirits moved the vehicle. The girls become upset at being tricked and ask to go home. The boys try to start the vehicle, but are unable to do so. One of the couples decides to stay with the vehicle, while the other tries to walk to town for help.

Other sources such as Stefano Della Casa state that Freda was commissioned to shoot a Shakespeare adaptation by the Spanish company Hispamer Films, and accepted only as it would allow him to make a period drama, which he could inject elements of his favourite genre, the adventure film. The film reinvents the Montague and Capulets as land and cattle owners with disputes over land pastures. Minutella had suggested that the elements are borrowed from Sergio Leone's Westerns of the period, which Italian film critic and historian Curti stated was impossible as the films were only released days apart from each other. Geronimo Meynier was cast as Romeo in the film, which was his final acting role. Originally, Brett Halsey was going to play the lead, with Halsey stating that Freda planned to shoot the film in English in four weeks and feared he would not have adequate time for rehearsal and turned down the role, which led to Freda and him not speaking for years. Romeo and Juliet was shot in Madrid and Ávila. Ruggero Deodato was an assistant director on set, and claimed that \\"Freda was a genius. I learned a lot from him. He was an intelligent person, cultured, and even a bit nasty on the set.

McMaster frequently practices self-portraiture to explore themes of representation and identity, and incorporates elements of sculpture and costume design in her work as well as elements of performance and installation. ==Work== In her work, McMaster explores \\"tensions surrounding understanding one's personal identity and heritage, especially her own as a woman of Indigenous (Plains Cree) and European (British/Dutch) descent\\". She adopts a performative approach in which she blurs the boundaries between performance, sculpture, and photography by incorporating elaborate costumes and props in order to create staged images. McMaster considers these elements to be tools of personal transformation that become extensions of her body.Manon Gaudet, \\"Crossovers: Meryl McMaster\\", Border Crossings, 141, vol. 136 no.1 (March 2017): 91.

The group's efforts raised public awareness and won the support of the Scottish Parliament. Azzudin has been featured in The Guardian, The Herald, The Scotsman, The Press and Journal, The Sunday Post. ==Early life== Azzudin moved from Egypt to Glasgow, Scotland, with her mother in 2000. Four years later the Home Office granted the family leave to remain. She is one of the founders of The Glasgow Girls – a group of Drumchapel High School students who, from 2005, campaigned against dawn raids and the deportation of refugee families. The other girls were Roza Salih, Ewelina Siwak, Toni-Lee Henderson, Jennifer McCarron and Emma Clifford. The group was formed after the home of one of their school friends, Agnesa Murselaj, a Roma from Kosovo, was dawn-raided one Sunday morning by 14 bullet-proof vested officers from the UK Border Force. After several weeks the family had not been released. “Even though I had my leave to remain, I couldn’t just sit there. I had to do something. That could have been my family,” Azzudin says. == The Glasgow Girls campaign == The Glasgow Girls, encouraged by teacher Euan Girvan, formed a strategy to campaign on behalf of the family. Their online petitions to the Home Office went viral, and the then First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell agreed to meet them. The Glasgow Girls not only successfully prevented the deportation of the Murselaj family, but also forced a change in the asylum protocols. == Career and later life == Since leaving University, Amal Azzudin has worked for the Mental Health Foundation in Scotland as Equality and Human Rights Officer. Her main role is to manage the refugee programme, including the Sawti project. Sawti, which means “my voice” in Arabic, aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing and has developed a mentoring scheme for refugees and asylum seekers in Scotland. In 2015, Azzudin accompanied campaigners Margaret Woods and Pinar Aksu to Lesvos, where as many as 3000 refugees per day were arriving from Turkey. She wrote a diary of her experiences for The Herald Scotland. She is an ambassador for the Scottish Refugee Council. ==Awards== * 2016 Saltire Society's Young Outstanding Woman of Scotland.

Instrumental in winning women workers the right to a minimum wage for the first time, the NFWW broke down barriers for women's membership in trade unions in general. In contrast to the numerous small craft unions which organised women workers in the late 19th century, the NFWW was established in 1906 as a general trade union open to all women across a range of industries where women's work predominated, where wages were low and where trade unionism had to that time been unsuccessful. The Scottish suffragist Mary Macarthur played a key role throughout the NFWW's existence, leading campaigns against sweated industries, mobilising public support for striking members, lobbying for legislative reform and engaging with the broader labour movement. In 1921 the NFWW amalgamated into the National Union of General Workers as that organisation's women worker's section. == Beginnings == The NFWW was established out of frustration that existing trade unions were not open to female members. When first established, the NFWW was met with resistance from others within the trade union movement. The male-dominated unions regularly opposed the idea of \\"organised women\\" who would damage the status of trade unionism by the nature of having women who could not vote be part of the political movement. The earlier established Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) promoted union membership to women, however the WTUL was not itself a trade union and acted instead as an umbrella group for women who were members of other existing unions. The unsuccessful dispute in 1906 of women workers in the Dundee Jute industry highlighted the need for a coordinated union. The Dundee dispute failed due to the inability of the WTUL to raise £100 required for a strike fund to support the strikers. Those involved in the federation supported opening existing unions, however, at the time the Trades Union Congress did not allow mixed-sex unions affiliation and therefore an all-female union was needed. The NFWW is recognised as having a major influence in influencing the Liberal Party to introduce the Trade Boards Act 1909 which set minimum wages for industries that had a high proportion of female workers. == Growth of the NFWW == 378x378px By the end of 1906 the NFWW had seventeen branches and 2,000 members, this grew to an estimated peak of around 40,000 in 1914. The union's first successful action came in 1908, when it supported striking workers at the Corruganza box factory in Summerstown, London. This strike was organised in response to wage cuts at the factory. After organising the workers, the local NFWW organiser, Sophy Sanger, negotiated a settlement which saw wages brought back to the previous levels for most of the jobs at the factory. In 1910 the NFWW organised a strike of around 800 women working as chain makers in Cradley Heath after they were denied the minimum 11s (55p) weekly wage as set in the Trade Boards Act. Chainmaking was the first industry to have minimum wages set under the act, however for six months workers were allowed to contract out of the new rates, allowing unscrupulous employers to demand or trick workers into agreeing to low rates of pay. This led to concern from the NFWW that employers were planning on stockpiling large quantities of chain made within the six-month window and later dismiss the workers once the minimum wage level was set. Mary Macarthur was also concerned that the result of this action would lead to the impression that having set minimum wages would lead to unemployment increases.207x207pxThe NFWW worked with employers who were willing from the start to pay the minimum wage by ensuring them that their undercutting competitors would not get an advantage. The only way this could be achieved was to ensure workers for the company's refusing to pay the minimum wage went on strike in August 1910. A strike fund raised by the union raised around £4,000 (approx. £450,000 in 2018 value) to support the strikers. Part of the success of the chainmakers' strike fundraising was due to the ability of the NFWW and Mary Macarthur to attract wide support amongst newspapers. Collections were made in local communities across the United Kingdom and Ireland from outside churches, football grounds, factories and Labour Party meetings. A Pathé news film of the chainmakers strike was produced around this time and was shown in picture theatres across the country which also helped the union come to the attention of the wider public. Within a month 60% of the employers had agreed to pay the minimum wage requirement and after 10 weeks the final employer agreed on 22 October 1910. After the strike found success to raise wages, the remainder of the fund built the Cradley Heath Workers' Institute. The 1913 networkers' strike in Kilbirnie in Ayrshire was agreed at an National Federation of Women Workers meeting in late March. It lasted from April to September 1913 and it was the longest recorded strike of women workers at that time. The strike was led by NFWW activist Kate McLean and it enjoyed broad community support. For example in May 1913 there was a meeting in Kilbirnie where 10,000 supporters were present. The networkers dispute was resolved on 2 September 1913 with improved wages and working conditions created by the NFWW. == World War 1 == During the First World War many women were drafted in to fill posts left vacant by men enlisted to armed forces. Between 1914 and 1918 an additional one million women would take up employment. Many of them however found poor conditions, low pay and long hours resulting in a number of industrial actions and disputes with employers supported by trade unions including the NFWW. During the war period trade union membership amongst women increased by 160%. Action by the NFWW was successful during the war period as both employers and the government were sensitive to action because of labour shortages due to the conflict. The first notable action of the NFWW during the First World War was at Ainsworth Mill in Cleator Moor in 1915. This mill created created khaki thread for the uniforms of soldiers of the First World War. The workers were paid substantially low wages of between seven and nine shillings for a working week of 60 hours. The local Labour Party MP William Anderson, husband of NFWW leader Mary Mcarthur, called for an investigation into the low rates of pay in the House of Commons. A strike of 250 women and 20 boys followed the demands of an investigation which resulted in a 10% War bonus being paid to employees, alongside official recognition for the NFWW, after six weeks of dispute. In the same year the NFWW branch associated with the Hayes munitions factories had a membership of over half the women employed by the firm in 1915. A delegation from the union demanded equal pay for the women employed by the firm to end the inequality of wages between female and male workers. Men were paid seven pence an hour while female workers only received three and a half pence. Following on from these successes in 1916 the NFWW assisted local worker to stage a sit-in protest at a munitions factory in Newcastle over the failure of a local company to pay out on a tribunal award to increase wages for local women workers. During the sit-in the workers knitted socks for soldiers on the front line of the First World War and refused to operate the factory machinery. This resulted in a furious phone call by the then Minister for Munitions Winston Churchill to Mary Macarthur demanding to know why she allowed the workers to stop. Macarthur told Churchill that the women would not go back to work until the tribunal findings had been paid. After 24 hours, the firm relented and back paid the missing wages. A later strike of 1920, again over low wages was organised at Ainsworth Mill. Later in 1916 over 2,500 young women went on strike in April 1916 at Greenwood and Batley's Leed's factory supported by the NFWW. Their dispute was around the gross differences in pay between the highest and lowest paid members of staff. The firm claimed the action was \\"unorganised and irresponsible\\".The badge of the NFWW. Joint hands are a common symbol in the trade union movement, in this case the two sleeves of the arms are slightly different to represent male and female joint action.Industrial action became more common in the UK as the war progressed as real wages shrank as a result of inflation and the output expectations to contribute to the war effort resulted in longer working hours. For the NFWW a dispute was established in 1917 after a total of 21 female workers were dismissed from Darlington railway point manufacturer Thomas Summerson and Sons. These workers two of the workers attended an arbitration tribunal between the company and female workers. The NFWW brought a victimisation case against the firm offered to substitute those dismissed with new women but the NFWW demanded that all 21 workers be reinstated. Not only did the actions during the First World War cement the NFWW as a trade union with the ability to successfully carry out industrial disputes but it also came at a time where there was wider political discussions on the rights of women including the suffrage movement. == Later action and merger with NUGW == The NFWW were involved in the 1918 tram and bus strikes that affected transport in the West London area. By the end of the War the London General Omnibus Company employed 3,500 women with many other firms having large proportions of female workers as well. They demanded \\"equal pay for equal labour\\" for female workers. The NFWW took part in the 1919 International Congress of Working Women where Mary Macarthur represented the union as one of two representatives from the United Kingdom, the other being Margaret Bondfield who represented the Trades Union Congress. In 1920 the NFWW merged with the National Union of General Workers initially as a district of the larger NUGW to represent women workers. It was believed at the time of the mergers that being part of a larger union would be an advantage but that a distinct identity for women within the NGWU could be maintained. As a 'district' it ensured that women had direct representation however by 1930 this unique status had been lost and therefore the direct representation of women in the leadership of the NUGW and as delegates to the Trades Union Congress was lost. == The Woman Worker newspaper == An issue of The Women Worker from 1907Te NFWW had a high-profile at the time partially due to their publication of their newspaper The Woman Worker, which collated allegories, anecdotes and related advertisements associate with members of the NFWW. Starting as a monthly publication the paper's popularity led to a weekly publication with a circulation of around 20,000. In the first edition of the paper Mary Macarthur stated in the editorial the purpose of the paper was to \\"To teach the need for unity, to help improve working conditions, to present a monthly picture of the many activities of women Trade Unionists, to discuss all questions affecting the interests and welfare of women. Such, in brief, is our aim and purpose.\\" While much of the content was focused on unionism and women's rights the paper also contained lighter content such as features entitled 'The Art of Beauty' and 'Home Hints'. == References  External links == *British Pathé film from 1911 \\"Factory Girls Strike\\" featuring strikers in Camden carrying an NFWW banner. *Original documents from the 1910 Cradley Heath Chain Makers Strike, University of Warwick *Oral History recording of Frank Bradbury, munitions worker at Greenwood and Batley Munitions Factory.

Its members primarily live in the Terres réservées aux Cris or Cree reserved land (Indian reserve) of Eastmain, Quebec. It is governed by a band council and is a member of the Tribal Council of the Grand Council of the Crees. ==Location== The reserve is located on the southern shore at the mouth of the Eastmain River as it empties into the eastern shore of James Bay. Adjacent to the reserved land is the village cri or Cree village of the same name. A Cree village is set aside for the use of the Nation, but members do not permanently residing there. The community is one of nine Cree First Nations that make up Eeyou Istchee, an equivalent territory which is an enclave within the Jamésie territory of Nord-du-Québec (Northern Quebec). The Eastmain Cree reserved land is and Eastmain Cree village is . The community is accessible by road; to the James Bay Road which connects to the cities of the south. The community's airport, Eastmain River Airport, has regular service by Air Creebec to Montreal and other Cree and northern communities. ==History== Ancestors of today's First Nations occupied the region around James Bay for more than 7000 years with artifacts dated to 3000–3500 years ago. Nomad hunters followed game as the last glaciers melted. Eventually, the groups later permanently establishing themselves in what is known as Eeyou Istchee (the Cree traditional territory in eastern James Bay). Henry Hudson, during his exploration of the bay with his name, first made contact with the Crees of James Bay in 1610. After spending the winter of 1668–1669, explorers Pierre- Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers convinced the English Crown, primarily Prince Rupert of the Rhine that a colonial enterprise in the bay would yield wealth in minerals and fur. This led to the creation of the Hudson Bay Company. As a result, the trading outposts were established in the region and the fur trade boomed. Eastmain got its name in 1730 by the local Hudson Bay trading post that had become the company's trading headquarters for the east coast of James Bay and Hudson Bay. The town was known as East Main House and was originally located on the north shore of the Eastmain River, but in 1762, Eastmain was relocated to the south shore because it provided easier access to the town from the James Bay. Cree people began to settle in the area and the community of Eastmain was established in the early 18th century, however, the territory was reserved for the use of the Crees only in 1962. ==Population== , Eastmain had a total registered population of 917 members with 806 living on the reserve.

Persephone then talks about the bodies starting with Antonio Fernandez. Persephone states that the copy of Mister Sinister's work contains the future's mutants. Before disappearing, Persephone advises them to stop looking or the ten bodies before them are just the beginning. The mysterious person then collapses as Daredevil claims that he was dead the moment the transmission ended. As Storm states that Cerebro can only detect manifested mutants, Iron Man asks Kitty Pryde what her next course of action is. Meanwhile, in Persephone's lair, she muses on the effectiveness of her performance towards heroes of such renown as the X-Men and Iron Man, hoping that Tony Stark in particular would understand her intentions. As she removes her gloves, she casually comments on her distaste in the use of killing children to make an impression. Tethered by energy ropes and suspended by his arms and legs before her, Wolverine reacts angrily to the callous statement and extracts his claws, which are shown to be glowing red hot. Persephone states that he need not worry, as this will all be over soon.Hunt for Wolverine: Dead Ends #1.

It appeared in history books of Southern dynasties of China such as Book of Song, Book of Liang and Book of Qi. However its existence is disputed by many historians. == Outline  Controversy == The Book of Qi locates Baekje in the south part of Korea. For the Northern Wei to attack Baekje, they need to pass through the sea or cross the territory of Goguryeo. Since Northern Wei and Goguryeo were opposed, it was difficult to pass their territory. Cavalry cannot pass through the sea so if Northern Wei attacked Baekje, Baekje must have had territory in China. Also in Book of Song and Book of Liang, some descriptions can be interpreted that Baekje's territory was in Liaoxi. However, no related historical documents were found in Northern dynasty and no description of Baekje's territory in China appears in Korean history book Samguk sagi and Samgungnyusa. According to , the Japanese and Chinese academic community takes skeptical or negative positions on the existence of Jinping Commandery. It is impossible for the Commandery to survive the time of attacking Baekje by remnants of the defeated army of Northern Yan and attack by Northern Wei. He rejects such articles about Jinping Commandery as “totally misinformed articles” and he “never” bring those articles up. Inoue pointed out “In Liu Song dynasty, Baekje was highly appreciated as a counter to Goguryeo. In order to control Goguryeo’s alliance with Wei and Yan, it is necessary to exaggerate Baekje’s invasion to Liaoxi”. In the Korean academic community, the theory that Baekje invaded Liaoxi is still seen as factual. , who was a director of Ministry of Education in Korea, submitted “A bow of modification of the national history textbook” to the Congress which include the following points: 1) Dangun is a real person in the history. 2) Dangun's had the territory which reach to Beijing, China. 3) Wanggeom-seong was in Liaoning, China. 4) Four Commanderies of Han were in Beijing, China. 5) In 3rd to 7th century, Baekje ruled over east coast of China from Beijing to Shanghai. 6) Silla's first territory was east part of Manchuria and national border of Silla was in Beijing. 7) Baekje established Japanese culture. By 1990, Korean History textbook in high school described that Baekje attacked Liaoxi, but after 1990, it is described and illustrated as follows “Baekje strengthen their navy, invaded Liaoxi district in China, and what’s more they actively reached to Shangxi district and Japan.”尹種栄『国史教科書の波動』ヘアン、1999、p22金相勲「韓国人の起源に関する中高生の意識と『国史』教科書との関係」『Yamagata University 歴史・地理・人類学論集、第13号』2012、p33 Young () researcher of of the Korean government, found many problems in the description of Baekje's advancement to Liaoxi and Shandong province and Kyusyu in Japan and he criticized them as not germane. “Although it seems that it is based on the Empress Jingu of Nihon Shoki and the description on Seven-Branched Sword, these interpretations have many problems.” Also, he criticizes the above interpretation as “When you use historical documents, you must remove arbitrary interpretation. If we follow Nihon Shoki, which has many problems, the history must be Japan’s advancement to Baekje, not Baekje’s advancement to Japan.” He pointed out problems for Baekje's advancement to Liaoxi and Jinping Commandery's existence. No description of Baekje's advancement to Lisoxi appears in Book of Wei in Northern dynasty. The event happened in the time of Former Qin, Book of Song and Book of Liang in the Southern dynasty. It would be difficult for Baekje to go through Goguryeo's territory, because at that time they had been fighting constantly. Young said, “If we believe everything in Chinese history books, we have to believe the description in records of the war with Wa that Baekje and Silla served to Wa as a great country.” said this theory was unbelievable. The theory of Baekje's territory in China rely on the history book in Southern dynasties such as Liu Song dynasty, Southern Qi and Liang dynasty. In the book of Southern dynasties, the description about Northern Wei in Northern dynasties are oral tradition level. In Book of Song, there are some descriptions of Baekje, but in Book of Qi, the description of Baekje is squeezed in the chapter of Nanman together with Goguryeo, Gaya and Wa. She criticized that such amount of information is too little to trust. Also, she pointed out that people in that age had little sense of belonging to the country and were freer to move from country to country. In Korea and surrounding areas, people from multiple countries mixed and lived together. At that time, China and Korea shared the same economic zone, that some people moved from Baekje and made a community in Liaoxi. Shunpei Mizuno tends to think that Baekje possessed territory in China, but that “things are not as easy as imagination”. Based on Chinese history books, the occupation of Liaoxi by Baekje happened from the late 3rd century to the early 5th century, but at that time, Former Yan, Former Qin, Later Yan, Southern Yan, Northern Wei tried to get the land of Liaoxi and even in the most confusing time of the Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern and Southern dynasties, Baekje could not make Liaoxi their territory. Articles related to Jinpyung Commandery were found only in history records of Southern dynasty, which had close relationship with Baekje but nothing in the history books of Southern dynasty. No records of advancement of Baekje are found in Korean history book Samguk sagi and Samgungnyusa. The records of impingement with Northern Wei are written in Book of Qi. Because of those reasons, Mizuno says “This theory is skeptical in the academic community” and “It cannot be said this theory is widely accepted in the historical academy.” He pointed out that the Southern dynasty put importance on Baekje because their international policy was not to accept their weakening by Northern Wei, which was the strongest competitor. So, they put Baekje into their closed international circle and wrote a history book as Baekje insisted. == References  Sources == * * Category:Former commanderies of China Category:Northern and Southern dynasties Category:History of Liaoning Category:Baekje ","title":"Jinping Commandery"},{"id":"56787291","text":"The Eatonton Historic District in Eatonton, Georgia is a historic district which is centered around the Putnam County Courthouse and the city hall, and includes most of the town.

In an interview with Variety, Zimmerman stated that \\"this album wouldn't even be if it weren't for [Tidal]. This is what enabled me to do it\\". It was also stated that the album will release on other digital download platforms at a later date, after the exclusivity period expires. On March 30, 2018, the album was released on Tidal. An upcoming release on vinyl was also announced that day. The album was released on other digital download services and vinyl three months later, on June 29, 2018. ==Critical reception== Christina Hernandez from Dancing Astronaut felt that the album \\"does just fine without the explosion of bass- backed kicks and loud synthesizers\\" as referred to in the album's title, instead it \\"casts [Deadmau5]'s music in a profound, contemplative light through is delicate layers of string, horn, percussion, and piano\\". ==Track listing== Notes * All tracks stylized in all lowercase == Charts == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" !Charts !Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Classical Albums (Billboard) align=\\"center\\"9 } ==Release history== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !

The summit was the third inter-Korean summit – and the first in eleven years. It was also the first time since the end of the Korean War in 1953 that a North Korean leader entered the South's territory; President Moon also briefly crossed into the North's territory. The summit took place after the two sides held several meetings in preparation for the joint attendance at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The idea initially was brought forward through an official invitation from the North to conduct a meeting. The summit was focused on the North Korean nuclear weapons program and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The Panmunjom Declaration was made following the summit. ==Agenda== The two Koreas' high government officials held a working-level meeting on 4 April 2018 to discuss summit details at the Peace House in the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The agenda was planned to include denuclearization, peace establishment and improvement of inter-Korean relations for their mutual benefit. Although more than 200 NGOs called for the inclusion of human rights issues in the North and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe for its abducted citizens in the agenda, these were not included. ==Meeting== Moon and Kim shaking hands over the demarcation line The Peace House was accepted by North Korea for the meeting's location, from among the venues proposed by South Korea, located just south of the military demarcation line in the Joint Security Area of Panmunjeom. The meeting was the first visit by a North Korean leader to the territory of the South Area after the Korean War 1950-53. This initial meeting of the two leaders, who shook hands over the demarcation line, was broadcast live. Moon accepted an invitation from Kim to briefly step over to the North's side of the line, a seemingly impromptu moment, before the two walked together to the Peace House. There was some controversy with the arrangement of a joint-service guard of honor formed by the Republic of Korea Armed Forces for Chairman Kim.http://m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php?ud=20180427000171 The Ministry of National Defense justified this move by pointing out that Presidents Kim Dae- jung and Roh Moo-hyun were an equally welcoming reception during their visits to the DPRK in 2000 and 2007 respectively. They also used the Cold War as a historical reference, saying that \\"when violent conflicts continued between the United States and the Soviet Union, the United States and China, honor guards were organized for leaders of other countries\\".http://russian.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=157916 The official website of the Blue House had a petition that was signed by over a thousand people who opposed thus reception.https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs- trending-43905076http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=247968 As well as the talks, the two leaders conducted a tree-planting ceremony using soil and water from both sides and attended a banquet. Many elements of the meeting were expressly designed for symbolism, including an oval meeting table measuring to represent the year. ===Other attendees=== The two leaders were accompanied by their wives, Kim Jung-sook and Ri Sol-ju, and a number of other individuals were present at the meeting: North Korea *Kim Yong-nam, President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly and nominal head of state *Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, alternate member of the Politburo (Political Bureau) *Kim Yong-chol, Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea *Choe Hwi, Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea *Ri Son-gwon, Chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland *Ri Myong-su, chief of the general staff of the Korean People's Army *Ri Yong-ho, foreign minister *Ri Su-yong, Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea *Pak Yong-sik, Minister of People's Armed Forces South Korea Members of the South Korean delegation *Chung Eui-yong, National Security Office director, equivalent to national security advisor *Suh Hoon, National Intelligence Service director *Cho Myoung-gyon, Minister of Unification *Im Jong-seok, Chief Presidential Secretary, equivalent to chief of staff, and chairman of South Korea's summit preparatory committee *Song Young-moo, Minister of National Defense *Kang Kyung-wha, Minister of Foreign Affairs *Jeong Kyeong-doo, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ==Dokdo desserts and Japanese culinary complaint== Kim and Moon dining at the summit On 24 April 2018, Japanese Foreign Ministry protested to the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the State of Japan, citing the appearance of desserts named \\"Dokdo\\" on the dinner menu used during the summit. Dokdo is the Korean name of a small island group, known as Takeshima in Japanese, midway between the Republic of Korea and Japan. It is the subject of a long-standing sovereignty dispute. The mango mousse desserts were accompanied by Korean- style decorations and a depiction of the Korean peninsula that included the islands. On 27 April 2018, Tarō Kōno, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, said he felt it was unnecessary to have a \\"Dokdo\\" dessert and reiterated claims that the island group is a territory of Japan. Despite the complaint, the Dokdo desserts were served to both Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un during the summit.https://www.alamy.com/moon-jae-in-and-kim-jong-un-apr-27-2018-south- korean-president-moon-jae-in-r-and-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-use- mallets-to-open-mango-mousse-decorated-with-a-flag-symbolizing-an-unified- korean-peninsula-during-a-banquet-after-the-historic-inter-korean-summit-at- the-peace-house-of-the-panmunjom-in-the-demilitarized-zone-dmz-separating-the- two-koreas-in-paju-north-of-seoul-south-korea-the-historic-summit-ended-on- april-27-with-calls-for-the-complete-denuclearization-of-the-korean-peninsula- and-an-immediate-halt-to-all-hostile-acts-local-media-reported-editorial-use- only-photo-image182486441.html Both also personally cracked open their desserts with small mallets to symbolize a new relationship. ==Joint press conference and agreement== Kim and Moon signing the Panmunjom Declaration In a joint press conference, Kim and Moon made a number of pledges regarding co- operation and peace. Notably, these included a pledge to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, although Kim did not explicitly agree to give up the North's nuclear weapons. Additionally the two leaders agreed to, later in the year, convert the Korean Armistice Agreement into a full peace treaty, formally ending the Korean War after 65 years. Additionally, the leaders pledged to end \\"hostile activities\\" between their nations, for the resumption of reunion meetings for divided families, to improve connections along their border, and for the cessation of propaganda broadcasts across it. This agreement was known as the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula and was signed by both leaders in the South Korean border village of Panmunjom. The press conference was shown live on South Korean television; however, live coverage was not available in North Korea since the country's policy is not to broadcast live events involving its leader. The leaders pledged greater communication between them, and that Moon would visit Pyongyang in late 2018. ==Aftermath== In the aftermath of the summit, it was agreed that the loudspeakers in the Korean Demilitarized Zone were dismantled beginning on 1 May. This commitment was fulfilled as planned and both sides also committed to ending their balloon propaganda campaigns as well.https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-05-05/south-korea-faces-decision-over- leaflets-ties-warm-north At the same time, North Korea agreed to realign its time with South Korea. On 5 May, North Korea changed its time zone so it would match that of South Korea. Also on May 5, an attempt by North Korean defectors to continue the balloon campaign across the border from South Korea was halted by the South Korean government.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/05/south-korea-sabotages- anti-north-korea-leaflet-drop/ During the 2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships, the table tennis teams from the two Koreas entered separately, but when they were paired against each other at the quarter-final of the women's event, they negotiated instead to field a joint team for the semifinal, with the agreement of the International Table Tennis Federation. The Korea Team went on to lose to Japan 3-0 in the semi-finals. ===May 2018 summit=== Kim and Moon at the May 2018 Summit on the North Korean side of Panmunjom On 26 May, Kim and Moon met again in the Joint Security Area, this time on the North Korean side of the Panmunjom village. The meeting took two hours, and unlike other summits it had not been publicly announced beforehand. Photos released by South Korea's presidential office showed Moon arriving at the northern side of the Panmunjom truce village and shaking hands with Kim's sister, Kim Yo-jong, before sitting down with Kim for their summit. Moon was accompanied by his spy chief, Suh Hoon, while Kim was joined by Kim Yong-chol, a former military intelligence chief who is now a vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party's central committee tasked with inter-Korean relations. The meeting was largely centered around North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's upcoming summit with US President Donald Trump. Kim and Moon also embraced before Moon returned to South Korea. Moon revealed details of the summit in a public address on 27 May. ===September 2018 summit=== On 13 August, it was announced that a third 2018 inter-Korean summit would be held in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in September. The meeting is designed to capitalize on what was accomplished at the previous two summits. Ri Son Gwon, the head of the North Korean delegation, told reporters that a specific date for the summit was already set, but that they wanted to \\"keep reporters wondering.\\" It was announced on August 31 that South Korean President Moon Jae-In will send a special delegation to North Korea on September 5 to hold more nuclear talks and set up the summit.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/s-korean-envoy-to- travel-to-north-for-pre-summit-talks/2018/08/31/bbe2e1fe- acf3-11e8-9a7d-cd30504ff902_story.html The delegation arrived in North Korea as scheduled. It was determined that the summit would be held for three days and would take place between September 18 and September 20.

It is located in the northern half of Germany, south of Berlin. The history of Leipzig from 1933 to 1939, is affected by the actions of the Nazi regime. From the beginning of the Nazi party's rise to power in 1933, to the beginning of World War II in 1939, Leipzig was an important city to the regime. Thousands of Jews were transported to and from this city as Adolf Hitler's plans for the Jewish people evolved. Between the years of 1933 to 1939, Jews suffered from the implementation of over 400 anti- Jewish policies, laws, and regulations. However, other than the history of the Holocaust, Leipzig, Germany has a rich history and culture. == 1933 == Relations were strengthened with south-eastern European countries once the Nazis rose to power, because Nazi leaders orchestrated agreements and under- hand deals. Because of Germany's relatively large size compared to other European countries, it was easier to gain economic power in trade, especially the power they had from the Leipzig Trade Fair, and use that as leverage to force countries like former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria to tolerate German power. Eventually, after the Nazi party's rise to power in 1933, the Trade Fair was no longer as valuable to Nazi Germany and its economy because it relied on foreign goods to maintain its military strength. As the Nazi party began implementing anti-Jewish policies and expelling Jews, mainly male, from their high positions in the arts and academics, Jewish women began to lead the households, maintain the mental health of her family members, and urge them to immigrate and escape the evils coming. April 7, 1933 the Law for the Restoration and Civil Service was passed by Nazi leaders. This law allowed for the dismissal of Jews and other \\"politically unreliable\\" people from their positions in civil service including lawyers and doctors. The Saxon Ministry for Popular Education issued a directive to the schools of Leipzig, Germany in April 1933 that effectively called for the further segregation of Jews and Aryans in school that would later lead to more a more violent separation between the groups. == 1934 == At the Leipzig Trade Fair in 1934, the Economics Minister and Reichbank director, Hjalmar Schacht, included the agreements and deals from the 1933 Nazi rise to power in the New Plan for foreign trade. Adolf Hitler was determined to rearm the German military lead to foreign crises regarding foreign currency, but his determination harmed the economy. It was only the Leipzig Trade Fair that saved the German economy; because of its established reputation and network among other European countries, Germany was able to regulate trade licenses and prioritize importation to ultimately improve their exportation success and prevent further deficit. As the economy worsened, so did tensions for the Jews. Because of activity that was deemed rebellious or against the Nazi regime, 1,600 people were arrested in Leipzig towards the end of 1934. Jewish youth in various youth groups were prohibited from wearing uniforms and displaying pennants like their Aryan peers to help create a distinction between Aryan and non-Aryan. This rampant antisemitism caused Jews to flee the country. Eight hundred Jews emigrated from Leipzig to Palestine between the years of 1933 and 1935 to seek freedom from their religious persecution and escape the Nazi regime. To combat the antisemitic policies and decrees, Jews joined together in an attempt to save their culture. In December, over 575 Jews made up the Cultural Organization of the German Jews, or Kulturbund Deutscher Juden Ortsgruppe Leipzig as it later became known as, which was an organization dedicated to keeping Jewish culture alive and providing an outlet to Jews whose lifestyles were being stifled. == 1935 == Nazi propaganda infiltrated the city and served as a reminder to Jews that they were inferior, and advertisements to Aryan Germans of a better Germany. Later, the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935. These included two laws designed to further the divide between the Nazi Aryan race and Jews and to allow for the legal persecution of Jews. The Reich Citizenship Law was the first of the Nuremberg Laws which stripped Jews of their German citizenship and the Law for Protection of German Blood and German Honor was the second of the Nuremberg Laws which outlawed the union of a Jew and a German through marriage. Later, all Jews were expelled from schools in the state of Saxony by order of the Saxon education ministry and were to be transferred to various religious schools. On June 8, 1935 Jews were banned from all public baths and pools. In October, the Gemeinde, a German township, created a \\"Lehrhaus\\" to accommodate the Jewish children who were barred from public academics and extracurriculars. The Lehrhaus had taken on most of the duties relating to education and it allowed exiled Jewish scholars to act as teachers. == 1936 == The divide between Jewish children and Aryan children was deepened in 1939 when Aryan schoolchildren were directed, \\"to hold their nose if they meet a Jew in the street, because the Jews stink fearfully.\\" The synagogues in Leipzig were threatened in September when the Leipzig police force responded to complaints by the Gemeinde about the amount of synagogues in Leipzig by calling in a lawyer to help them shut them down. By 1936, the activities of the Kulturbund was shut down and it was required that they be approved by the Managing Director of the National Chamber of Culture, or Geschäftsführer of the Reichskulturkammer, after Wilhelm Gustloff, the head of the Foreign Section of the Swiss NSDAP, was assassinated by the Jewish David Frankfurter. This organization was another way for the Nazis to control the lives of the Jewish people by regulating their culture and activities. Jews were accused of being too political during one of their worship services and were thus barred from practicing their religion in any Gemeinde hall. By 1936, many Rabbis had fled the country and emigrated to other European nations so they could freely practice their faith. * == 1937 == The Ministry of Education, along with the Berlin and Leipzig deans of the philosophy sector, discussed the higher education of Jews and concluded that since Jews were allowed to attend college, they were allowed the right to earn a doctorate degree. However, on April 15, 1937, this conclusion lead to a decision made by the Minister of Education, that outlawed Jews from obtaining a doctorate degree. The Gestapo notified the two members of Gemeinderrabbiner, Goldschimdt and David Ochs, that Leipzig had too many synagogues and advised that they be shut down before then were closed by force. Eventually, even youth meetings were banned. == 1938 == Several south-eastern countries such as former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Hungary all began selling products in Leipzig by 1938 which helped Germany follow through with its promise to prioritize importation which in turn helped to improve the German economy. Former Yugoslavia began selling higher priority items at the Leipzig Trade Fair in the late 1930s and increased its participation in the fair. Further segregation was implemented as police force requested that benches in the Rosenthal be reserved for Aryans only and marked as such. The Orthodox Rabbi, David Ochs spoke at the Lehrhaus and urged his audience of 700 Jews to emigrate to Palestine by speaking of the educational and religious freedoms it offered. Kristallnacht, an attack on the Jews of Germany and Austria, occurred in November and forever changed the lives of Jews in Leipzig by opening their eyes to the true antisemitic opinions of their neighbors. November 1938 is when the deportation of German Jews began. Jews and other non-Germans were prohibited by the German government from holding positions in the Gemeinde in early April which resulted in the loss of 51 of the 149 members. By 1939, 22% of the Jews in Leipzig were expelled, detained, or removed by other means. == 1939 == Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and former Yugoslavia made up 15% of the total amount of foreign participants at the Leipzig Trade Fair by 1939. Throughout the 1930s, the Leipzig Trade Fair and Germany's close relations with the south-eastern countries saved it from complete economic collapse and also allowed for the mobilization of Nazi Germany. It was required of the Gestapo to ban Jews from all parks to avoid the \\"automatic disadvantage\\" that the presence of Jews causes for the \\"German-blooded children\\". The population of Jews in Leipzig dropped from 11,000 in 1933 to 4,470 by 1939. Jews were forced from their homes to homes for Jews called \\"Judenhaus\\". == References  Bibliography == * * Kaplan, Marion A. Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany.

Suffragetto was among several children's games designed at that time around the themes of gender, resistance, and social relationships, along with the contemporaneous games Panko and Pank-a-Squith (1909). The goal of the latter was to navigate a suffragette (led by Emmeline Pankhurst) down a long path from her home to parliament, past obstacles placed by the Liberal government (led by Prime Minister H.

The game of Suffragetto was demonstrated in the second episode of the first season of the 2018 BBC documentary series Further Back in Time for Dinner. and in the documentary No Man Shall Protect Us: The Hidden History of the Suffragette Bodyguards (2018).

He began farming, but soon abandoned it to read law in his brother's law office in Pontiac. By 1844, Wisner had settled permanently in Pontiac, and in 1845 he contracted the building of this house. He was married three years later. As he began practicing law, Wisner became active in politics, and took part in the first Republican convention in 1854. In 1858, he ran for governor and was elected to a two-year term. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he raised a regiment; however, he died of typhoid fever in early 1863.

This squid has a mantle length of 30mm. It may be sexually dimorphic with the males possibly having very thin elongated arms III which are increasingly thread like towards their tips where they do not have any suckers. Arms II are \\"normal\\" and have suckers along their length. The third arms have a series of photophores along their length and there is a small photophore located on each of the tips of arms I and II. The tentacles have two embedded photophores and the largest of the eye's photophores is in the centre. There is a pair of large photophores vlose to the tip of the mantle on the ventral side mantle; with no other photphores on the body except for a visceral photophore which is also near the tip. There is practically no tail. N. regalis is known only from the Kermadec Islands near New Zealand, one of the specimens was beached while the other two were caught by a trawl at a depth of 48m. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1913 ","title":"Nematolampas regalis"},{"id":"56787732","text":"Bessie Lee (née Lum; August 26, 1924 – December 22, 2016) was a Chinese Canadian community organizer and civic activist in Vancouver's Strathcona and Chinatown neighbourhoods. She was a co-founder and long-time President of the Strathcona Property Owners and Tenants Association (SPOTA), which was instrumental in mobilizing several neighborhoods to work together to stop a freeway in the late 1960s that would have run through the heart of many of Vancouver's inner-city neighborhoods. Lee was also a founding member of the Britannia Community Centre and a board member of the Strathcona Community Centre. She won the BC Community Achievement Award in 2014. == Early life and education == Lee grew up in Vancouver's Chinatown in the 1930s. She attended Lord Strathcona Elementary School and Vancouver Normal School. Her family operated a fish and general store that served the Chinese bachelors living in Chinatown. From her mother, an herbalist, Lee learned how to prepare herbal tonics and medicinal preparations made from roots, leaves, bark and wild animal parts that the older men would bring in from the bush. Because her father died young, Lee quit school before graduation to help her widowed mother run the business. When she was 20 years of age, Bessie eloped with Henry James Lee. They had eight children. == Strathcona Property Owners and Tenants Association (SPOTA) == In 1968, out of necessity, Bessie Lee embarked on a lengthy career as a community organizer and civic activist. With her home threatened by expropriation and the bulldozer under Phase 3 of the City of Vancouver's Urban Renewal Project and with nowhere else to go, Lee decided to get involved. She was a co-founder of the SPOTA with fellow Vancouver civic activist Mary Lee Chan in November/December 1968. SPOTA was a strong unified community voice against the freeway that was planned to through Strathcona as part of an \\"urban renewal\\" program. At the beginning of SPOTA, Lee initially served as the English Secretary eventually becoming its long-time President. Lee and SPOTA helped to halt the program as it would have destroyed the older neighborhoods of Vancouver. In 1968, Robert Andras, the federal minister in charge of housing for Pierre Trudeau's new Liberal government met with SPOTA. Andras' visit resulted in the halting of the City of Vancouver's existing redevelopment plan and an investment of $5 million in a pilot project. Itt engaged SPOTA in a planning process that involved each level of government and saw existing buildings, streets, and sidewalks in Strathcona rehabilitated and new parks and a community centre built. The pilot became a national program for preserving older, inner city neighborhoods. SPOTA received a Governor General's award for this project. == Advocacy work == Among her many achievements, Lee spearheaded the campaign to build affordable co-operative, infill housing for families and seniors on vacant lots. She worked to improve health and social services delivery to Strathcona families and elders. She helped to develop and manage integrated community recreation centers and parks in Strathcona and Grandview Woodland. Lee was a founding member of the Britannia Community Centre and the Strathcona Community Centre's elected Boards. The Strathcona Linear Park was a direct result of her determination that the City of Vancouver replace the original MacLean Park that was superseded by public housing towers. As a member of the Strathcona Rehabilitation Project steering committee she negotiated funding to build the Strathcona Linear Park and the Strathcona Community Centre. Working alongside others, Lee helped to pioneer innovative, culturally hybrid forms of community organizing such as ribbon cutting ceremonies, open houses and teas, walking tours and multi-venue Chinese banquets during municipal, provincial and federal elections to raise funds and to bring local issues to the forefront. In an interview in the book Opening Doors, Lee said: \\"We have to remind the city that when they decide to change things in a community they must always consider the social planning of that community and the concerns of the people who live in it.\\" == Awards == Lee won the BC Community Achievement Award in 2014. == References == Category:1924 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Vancouver Category:Canadian women activists Category:Canadian people of Chinese descent ","title":"Bessie Lee"},{"id":"56787742","text":"Haim Harari, Eretz Yisrael, 1907 Haim Harari (Shneur Zalman Blumberg) ( (July 13, 1883 – November 13, 1940) was a Hebrew teacher, writer, and publicist, member of the Second Assembly of Representatives, an amateur actor and director, one of the founders of the 'Hebrew Stage Lovers Association',Staging and Stagers in Modern Jewish Palestine: The Creation of Festive Lore in a New Culture, 1882-1948 (Raphael Patai Series in Jewish Folklore and Anthropology), 2004 by Shoshana Sitton and Yaacov Shavit, p.55 and one of the founders of Tel Aviv.\\"Who were the 66 founders of Tel Aviv?\\" From the virtual library of CET (Centre For Educational Technology)The story behind the photo.
