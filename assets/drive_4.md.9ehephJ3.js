It started with 5 classes in the English stream and 4 in the Chinese Stream. Mr Mohd Said B H A Samad, the principal-designate, served the school for three and a half years until June 1981. Mr Soh Guan Ba took over as principal from June 1981 to December 1995. Mr Ee Chye Heng joined the school from 1995 to 2000, after which Mr Khairunan bin Ali took over the post. From 2008 to 2011, Mr Boo Chong Han was principal. In 2012 to 2015, Mr Jeffrey Low took over as principal. From 2016, Mrs Valerie Pinto is the principal. In January 1978 the school began functioning in its current premises and was officially opened on 28 September 1979 by Tuan Haji Sha'ari Tadin, former MP for Bedok. It was the 139th school built by the government and the first government secondary school in Bedok New Town. In 1992 major alterations and renovations were carried out, and a 4-storey classroom block was built under the Extension and Alteration Project. The school now has 36 classrooms, a language laboratory, a commerce room, two computer laboratories and six science laboratories. Extensions to the library, staff room and canteen were also carried out. The school subsequently underwent the Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools (PRIME) and the entire project was completed in mid-2005, providing up-to-date facilities for pupils and staff. A sports hall has been completed, which is available for the use of the public. This is a SGD 14 million joint investment from the Singapore Sports Council and the Ministry of Education. ==School Mission, Vision and Values== Our Vision: A School of High Standards, Quality Learning and Holistic Development Our Mission: To Nurture Students, Transform Lives and Serve the Nation Our Values:Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Service, Excellence ==School Motto== We Aspire, We Strive, We Dare for a Better Future ==School Crest== The Lighthouse is our school symbol and is depicted on our school crest.

Every quasinormal operator is a subnormal operator. Every quasinormal operator on a finite- dimensional Hilbert space is normal. == Definition and some properties == === Definition === Let A be a bounded operator on a Hilbert space H, then A is said to be quasinormal if A commutes with A*A, i.e. :A(A^*A) = (A^*A) A.\\\\, === Properties === A normal operator is necessarily quasinormal. Let A = UP be the polar decomposition of A. If A is quasinormal, then UP = PU. To see this, notice that the positive factor P in the polar decomposition is of the form (A*A), the unique positive square root of A*A. Quasinormality means A commutes with A*A. As a consequence of the continuous functional calculus for self adjoint operators, A commutes with P = (A*A) also, i.e. :U P P = P U P.\\\\, So UP = PU on the range of P. On the other hand, if h ∈ H lies in kernel of P, clearly UP h = 0. But PU h = 0 as well. because U is a partial isometry whose initial space is closure of range P. Finally, the self-adjointness of P implies that H is the direct sum of its range and kernel. Thus the argument given proves UP = PU on all of H. On the other hand, one can readily verify that if UP = PU, then A must be quasinormal. Thus the operator A is quasinormal if and only if UP = PU. When H is finite dimensional, every quasinormal operator A is normal. This is because that in the finite dimensional case, the partial isometry U in the polar decomposition A = UP can be taken to be unitary. This then gives :A^*A = (UP)^* UP = PU (PU)^* = AA^*.\\\\, In general, a partial isometry may not be extendable to a unitary operator and therefore a quasinormal operator need not be normal. For example, consider the unilateral shift T. T is quasinormal because T*T is the identity operator. But T is clearly not normal. == Quasinormal invariant subspaces == It is not known that, in general, whether a bounded operator A on a Hilbert space H has a nontrivial invariant subspace. However, when A is normal, an affirmative answer is given by the spectral theorem. Every normal operator A is obtained by integrating the identity function with respect to a spectral measure E = {EB} on the spectrum of A, σ(A): :A = \\\\int_{\\\\sigma(A)} \\\\lambda d E (\\\\lambda).\\\\, For any Borel set B ⊂ σ(A), the projection EB commutes with A and therefore the range of EB is an invariant subspace of A. The above can be extended directly to quasinormal operators. To say A commutes with A*A is to say that A commutes with (A*A). But this implies that A commutes with any projection EB in the spectral measure of (A*A), which proves the invariant subspace claim. In fact, one can conclude something stronger. The range of EB is actually a reducing subspace of A, i.e. its orthogonal complement is also invariant under A. == References == *P. Halmos, A Hilbert Space Problem Book, Springer, New York 1982.

Since the twentieth century, Bhutanese immigration and citizenship laws have been promulgated as acts of the royal government, often by decree of the Druk Gyalpo on advice of the rest of government. Immigration policy and procedure are implemented by the Lhengye Zhungtshog (Council of Ministers) Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs, Department of Immigration. Bhutan's first modern laws regarding immigration and citizenship were the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958 and subsequent amendments in 1977. The 1958 Act was superseded by the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985, which was then supplemented by a further Immigration Act in 2007. The Constitution of 2008 included some changes in Bhutan's immigration laws, policy, and procedure, however prior law not inconsistent with the 2008 Constitution remained intact. Bhutan's modern citizenship laws and policies reinforce the institution of the Bhutanese monarchy, require familiarity and adherence to Ngalop social norms, and reflect the social impact of the most recent immigrant groups. ==Historical overview== Historically, there have been at least five distinct waves of human migration into Bhutan. Before Tibetans settled in Bhutan, the area was populated by aboriginal people referred to as \\"Monpa\\". The first record of human movement into Bhutan is the settlement of the region by Tibetan Buddhists, who were thoroughly established by 600 CE. Their current autonym is \\"Ngalop\\". The second wave is represented by the Sharchops, who arrived from Burma or Assam sometime in the first millennium. The third wave of human migration was that of Nepalis and Indians as craftsmen, migrant workers, and slaves in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A fourth, much smaller wave of Tibetans came to Bhutan, beginning in 1959, followed fifth by continued immigration from India and Nepal during Bhutan's development projects in the 1960s despite a government ban in 1958. ==Immigration law and policy== Toward the end of the reign of the second King Jigme Wangchuck in the 1950s, the numbers of new immigrants had swelled causing tension between the King and the Dorji family in the Bhutan House. Amnesty was given through the Citizenship Act of 1958 – Bhutan's first modern laws regarding immigration and citizenship – for all those who could prove their presence in Bhutan for at least 10 years prior to 1958. On the other hand, the government also banned further immigration in 1958. The Act was pronounced by the Druk Gyalpo King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck among a series of legal and social reforms in 1958 designed to begin modernizing Bhutan, including the abolition of slavery. The 1958 Act defined Bhutanese citizenship in patrilineal terms, and provided a basic framework for the process of naturalization in Bhutan. Initially, applicants other than wives of Bhutanese citizens were required to show a ten- year residency, five years of service to the government, and ownership of agricultural land. The 1958 Act originally defined no procedural framework for immigration. It also allowed the King to make ad hoc changes to the law, and left decisions largely to the discretion of the King and government officials. In 1977, an amendment lengthened the residency requirement for naturalization to 20 years (15 years if in service to Bhutan), and the requirement of owning agricultural land was eschewed. Deprivation of citizenship as a punishment for sedition was expanded to associates and family relatives of seditious citizens. The amendment introduced other requirements, such as knowledge of Dzongkha and adherence to Ngalop customs. The amendment also introduced a procedural framework for citizenship and naturalization; namely it codified procedural requirements for census registration and births abroad and designated the Ministry of Home Affairs as the government agency to oversee immigration matters. The 1958 Act and 1977 amendments were superseded by the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985, though much of the procedural framework established in 1977 remains de jure in effect because it was not overridden. Since the Bhutanese Citizenship Act of 1985 and subsequent Immigration Act of 2007, immigration policy and procedure have been implemented by the Lhengye Zhungtshog (Council of Ministers), Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs, Department of Immigration. Procedural safeguards for both naturalization and bona fide citizenship remained largely absent: applicants could be rejected for no reason at all, such decisions were final and binding, and even bona fide Bhutanese citizens faced deprivation of citizenship for sedition. Placement and maintaining one's placement in the national census registry is of central importance to legitimizing and proving one's citizenship. Placement by government workers into census registry categories, which ranged from \\"Genuine Bhutanese\\" to \\"Non-nationals: Migrants and Illegal Settlers,\\" has been arbitrary, and could be arbitrarily changed. In some cases members of the same family have been, and still are, placed in different categories. Furthermore, only the entries recorded at the Dzongkhag (second highest) level are deemed valid; official local Dungkhag, Gewog, Chewog or other civil records are disregarded. Under the latest Immigration Act of 2007, department- level immigration officers were given a mandate, and left wide discretion, to enter private premises; examine documents, persons, and things; seize items; and arrest persons. These officers are immunized under the 2007 Act for all wrongful acts and omissions committed in good faith in the discharge of their duty. Bhutanese immigration policy, as reflected in its citizenship laws, can be described as highly assimilatory, requiring familiarity with the dominant Ngalop culture and allegiance to the Ngalop King of Bhutan. Its broader citizenship policy toward both immigrants and citizens alike can also be described as assimilatory, and on its face, a tool against dissent. ==History== Historically, there have been at least five distinct waves of human migration into Bhutan: two ancient and three since the 19th century. These migrant groups have, to varying degrees, shaped Bhutanese society, culture, and politics. They have also assimilated into the dominant Tibetan- Ngalop culture to varying degrees, one of the foremost concerns of modern Bhutanese immigration policy. ===Indigenous peoples and ancient migrations=== Before Tibetans settled Bhutan, much of the region was populated by the aboriginal Monpa who practiced the shamanistic Bön religion. Earliest records to the area which the Monpas inhabited today indicated the existence of a kingdom known as Monyul or Lhomon from 500 BC to 600 AD. Monyul spanned the areas of Eastern Bhutan, Tawang, Kameng and Southern Tibet. However, it remained thinly populated throughout its history. By the 7th century, Monyul had come under increasing Tibetan political and cultural influence. King Songtsen Gampo, who ruled Tibet from AD 627–649, was responsible for the construction of Bhutan's oldest surviving Buddhist temples, the Kyichu Lhakhang in Paro and the Jambay Lhakhang in Bumthang. The Sharchop (meaning \\"easterner\\"), are thought to have migrated next from Assam or Burma during the past millennium. Sharchop is a collective term for the populations of mixed Southeast Asian and South Asian descent found in the eastern districts of Bhutan. A few other indigenous groups, however, remained largely beyond the pale of Tibetan settlement and cultural influence. Among these are the Tibetan Buddhist Lhop and Hindu Toto people in the southwest. In the north the Tephoos, who immigrated from what is now known as India are a distinct community of the Hindu Koches and are found in the north of Bhutan. The Oraon are a Dravidian language speaking tribal group found in southwestern Bhutan. In the seventeenth century, a Tibetan expatriate Drukpa monk, Ngawang Namgyal established a theocratic government independent of political influence from Tibet proper, and premodern Bhutan emerged. Ngawang Namgyal arrived in Bhutan in 1616 seeking refuge from the domination of the Gelugpa sect led by the Dalai Lama in Lhasa. He established a new base in western Bhutan, founding Cheri Monastery at the head of Thimphu valley. In 1627 he built Simtokha Dzong at the entrance to Thimphu valley. From this dzong he exerted control over traffic between the powerful Paro valley to the west and Trongsa valley to the east. In the 1634 Battle of Five Lamas, Ngawang Namgyal prevailed over the Tibetan and Bhutanese forces allied against him and was the first to unite Bhutan into a single country. He took the title shabdrung, becoming the temporal and spiritual leader of Bhutan under a dual system of government. He promulgated a code of law, the Tsa Yig, and built a network of impregnable dzongs, a system that helped bring local lords under centralized control and strengthened the country against Tibetan invasions. Thus, more than 1,000 years of Tibetan influence and migration into the region brought about the formation of Bhutan. Today, the term Ngalop refers to those Bhutanese of ancient Tibetan descent who came to dominate Bhutan culturally and politically. The Ngalop are concentrated in the western and central valleys of Bhutan. They practice mostly Tibetan Buddhism and speak Dzongkha. The Sharchop comprise most of the population of eastern Bhutan. Although long the biggest ethnic group in Bhutan, the Sharchop have largely assimilated into the Tibetan-Ngalop culture. ===Immigration from Nepal and India=== Since Bhutan emerged as an independent state, the most significant immigrant groups have been from Nepal and India. These people are collectively called Lhotshampa (meaning \\"southerner\\"), though a collective name may present an oversimplification because of the diversity within the group. The first reports of people of Nepalese origin in Bhutan was around 1620, when Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal commissioned Newar craftsmen from the Kathmandu valley in Nepal to make a silver stupa to contain the ashes of his father Tempa Nima. The Newar are an ethnic group distinct from the Bahuns, Tamangs, Gurungs, Rais that form the Lhotsampa community. The next small groups of Nepalese emigrated primarily from eastern Nepal under British Indian auspices in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Members of many ethnic groups, including forefathers of Lhotshampa and others from Sikkim, the Assam Duars, and West Bengal, were brought into Bhutan as slaves (the institution was abolished in 1958). Seasonal migrants commonly worked in the Bhutan Duars, and began to settle in the 1880s. During the late 19th Century, contractors working for the Bhutanese government began to organise the settlement of Nepali-speaking people in uninhabited areas of southern Bhutan in order to open those areas up for cultivation. The south soon became the country's main supplier of food. By 1930, according to British colonial officials, much of the south was under cultivation by a population of Nepali origin that amounted to some 60,000 people. Settlement in Bhutan of large numbers of people from Nepal happened for the first time in the early 20th century. This settlement was encouraged by the Bhutan House in Kalimpong for the purpose of collecting taxes for the government. In the 1930s, the Bhutan House settled 5,000 families of Nepali workers in Tsirang alone. In the 1940s, the British Political Officer Sir Basil Gould was quoted as saying that when he warned Sir Raja Sonam Topgay Dorji of Bhutan House of the potential danger of allowing so many ethnic Nepalese to settle in southern Bhutan, he replied that \\"since they were not registered subjects they could be evicted whenever the need arose.\\" Furthermore, Lhotshampa were forbidden from settling north of the subtropical foothills. The beginning of Nepalese immigration largely coincided with Bhutan's political development: in 1885, Druk Gyalpo Ugyen Wangchuck consolidated power after a period of civil unrest and cultivated closer ties with the British in India. In 1910, the government of Bhutan signed a treaty with the British in India, granting them control over Bhutan's foreign relations. ===Tibetan refugees in Bhutan (1959)=== In 1959, Bhutan granted asylum to several thousand refugees after the Chinese took control of Tibet. The Tibetan refugees were fleeing famine, uprising, suppression, and persecution during Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward. Chinese demographers have estimated that 90,000 Tibetans became refugees. The people of Bhutan deeply sympathized with the refugees and extended assistance as much as possible within their capacity. Those Tibetan refugees renounced the right to return to Tibet were granted Bhutanese citizenship, however the majority told Bhutanese authorities they would like to return to Tibet one day. As a result, they remained refugees. In 1981, many Tibetan refugees in Bhutan chose to permanently resettle in India and they were allowed to do so. About half of the initial Tibetan refugees chose to remain in Bhutan and continued to live in these in seven settlements located across Bhutan. The seven Tibetan settlements in Bhutan are: Khunpheling (village of Karche), Namling (village of Badgarnang), Yidmonling (village of Lhongtso), Raptenling, Kunga Rabtenling, Kelsangling, and Kungaling. Most of settlements have a small monastery, a primary school, and a small heath clinic. In 1998, there were about 1,500 Tibetans living in Bhutan, and in 2007 there were about 1,883. Life remains relatively difficult for Tibetan refugees in Bhutan. Without a security clearance — something they claim is virtually impossible to obtain — Tibetans cannot get government jobs, enrol their children in higher education or obtain licenses to run private business. Many get around that rule by renting shop licenses off native Bhutanese, but it leaves them in an uncomfortable limbo. ===Immigration from Nepal and India (1959–present)=== Immigrants from Nepal and India continued to enter Bhutan during the 1960s when Bhutan's first modern 5-year plans began. Like the prior Nepalese immigrants, they came to be called Lhotshampa, blurring the line between citizens, legal residents, and persons illegally present. From 1961 onward, with Indian support, the government began planned developmental activities consisting of significant infrastructure projects. Uncomfortable with India's desire to bring in large numbers of workers from India, the government initially tried to prove its own capacity by insisting that the planned Thimphu-Phuntsholing highway be done with its own workforce. However, the import of workers from India was inevitable; most Bhutanese worked as farmers and were unwilling to take up the major infrastructure projects. Thus, most development and infrastructure laborers were of Nepali origin. The government traditionally attempted to limit immigration and restrict residence and employment of Nepalese to the southern region. Liberalization measures in the 1970s and 1980s encouraged intermarriage and provided increasing opportunities for public service. The government allowed more internal migration by Nepalese seeking better education and business opportunities. Large-scale assimilation into Tibetan-Ngalop culture, however, has not occurred among the Nepalese as it did among other groups. By the late 1980s, the Bhutanese government estimated 28 percent of the Bhutanese population were of Nepalese origin, though without distinguishing between earlier and later immigrants. Unofficial estimates of the ethnic Nepalese population ran as high as 30 to 40 percent, constituting a majority in the south. The number of legal permanent Nepalese residents in the late 1980s may have been as few as 15 percent of the total Nepalese population, however. ====Bhutanese refugees==== Bhutanese refugees In 1988, the government census revealed that the \\"Ngalop\\" population were very close to becoming the minority in the country in comparison to the \\"Lhotshampa\\".The results of the 1988 census led the government to adopt \\"\\"Ngalop\\" cultural traditions as the National norm in order to preserve the existing culture. In 1989, the Bhutanese government enacted reforms that directly impacted the Lhotshampa. First, it elevated the status of the national dress code of the Driglam namzha from recommended to mandatory. All citizens including the Lhotshampa were required to observe the Ngalop dress code in public during business hours. This decree was resented by the Lhotshampa, who voiced complaints about being forced to wear the clothing of the Ngalop majority. Second, the government removed Nepali as a language of instruction in schools in favor of Dzongkha, the national language. This alienated the Lhotshampa, many of whom knew no Dzongkha at all. In 1990, violent ethnic unrest and anti-government protests occurred in southern Bhutan, pressing for greater democracy and respect for minority rights. That year, the Bhutan Peoples' Party, whose members are mostly Lhotshampa, began a campaign of violence against the Bhutanese government. In the wake of this unrest, thousands fled Bhutan. The people who were exiled or fled consist not only of the \\"Lhotshampa\\" individuals but also many \\"Ngalop\\" individuals who aided in the violence against the government. Many of them have either entered Nepal's seven refugee camps (on January 20, 2010, 85,544 refugees resided in the camps) or are working in India. According to U.S. State Department estimates, about 35 percent of the population of Bhutan is Lhotshampa, if the displaced refugees are counted as citizens. ==See also== *Illegal immigration to Bhutan *Demographics of Bhutan **Monpa people **Ngalop **Sharchop **Lhotshampa *Tibetan diaspora *Slavery in Bhutan *Bhutanese refugees *Politics of Bhutan *Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985 *Cultural assimilation *Demographic threat ==Notes== Category:Bhutanese society Category:History of Bhutan ","title":"Immigration to Bhutan"},{"id":"7771873","text":"The various mass media in Bhutan have historically been government-controlled, although this has changed in recent years. The country has its own newspapers, television and radio broadcasters and Internet Service Providers. == Journalism == Kuensel, a newspaper of a government-owned corporation, circulates six days a week in Dzongkha and English. In 2006 two privately- owned, independent newspapers were launched as part of preparation for the country's move to democracy: Bhutan Times, and Bhutan Observer, which also produced a Dzongkha edition. Bhutan Today, an English daily newspaper launched in October 2008. The Journalist established in 2009 is a privately owned weekly English Language newspaper published on Sundays. In late September 2009, the first Financial Newspaper of Bhutan was launched with the name Business Bhutan. According to Freedom House, private newspapers in Bhutan face \\"financial fragility\\" and rely on government advertisements for approximately 80 percent of their income. Since private media outlets were made legal in 2006, the number of private media outlets has grown, reducing the access of each outlet to that revenue. In 2012, a financial crisis occurred and the government chose to only run advertisements for the then-upcoming 2013 elections on state media outlets. Due to their financial condition, newspapers cut their staff, and some implemented additional cost-cutting measures such as switching from publishing daily to publishing bi-weekly and temporarily ceasing to produce a print edition. The government was accused of intentionally reducing advertising revenue to retaliate against The Bhutanese's reporting on governmental corruption. In 2008 the Bhutan Centre for Media and Democracy was launched to \\"nurture democracy in Bhutan through civic engagement, public discourse and media literate citizens\\". == Radio and television == The Bhutan Broadcasting Service was established in 1973 as a radio service, broadcasting in short wave nationally, and on the FM band in Thimphu. The service started television broadcasts in 1999, making Bhutan the last country in the world to introduce television. As part of the King's modernization program, cable television was introduced shortly after. By 2002, however, the crime rate had increased appreciably, and the introduction of cable television is alleged to be responsible for the spurt in crime.The Bhutan Broadcasting Service (BBS) has been expanded and will be available Bhutan and will also be available in the region. The signal can be received in almost 40 other countries from Turkey to Indonesia. The Bhutan Broadcasting Service has now assumed the role of a true national broadcaster said by the minister of information and communications. In 2008 the adoption of the constitution by Lyonpo Leki Dorji meant that the BBS would now be taking on a more pivotal in educating the public. When they took the role to educate the public this meant they had to improve the quality of news and programs because it became imperative. Sudhir Vyas, ambassador of Bhutan, thinks India is privileged to be associated with the development of media in Bhutan. The launch was a true testimony and the support the government had for the media. This symbolized the role that the government played in the development of Bhutan. The Bhutan Broadcasting Service has also been said to be the cheapest and easiest way to educate people.Bhutan broadcasting service launches nationwide TV. (2006, Feb 20).

The mobile subscriber in 2014 was at 14%. As the market began to mature in 2015 it was 5% and 2% in 2015 and 2016, as market penetration reached 88% in 2016. It has been predicted in the next five years or so there will be a moderate growth. Over this time the mobile subscriber has reached an excessive of 100% at times. Internet access in the country has had a major boost by mobile networks, largely by EDGE/GPRS and the new 3G technology platforms. Even though this is the case now because they have been isolated from the rest of the world for a long time until the 1990s. The fixed telephone lines are declining in Bhutan from a small base as the mobile segment keeps expanding. Penetrations have dropped over the years as in 2014 dropped to 3.1%, 2015 dropped to 2.9%, and 2016 dropped to 2.7%. Internet in Bhutan developed down a slow path during the beginning of the internet because the country embraced the internet cautiously which is still continuing to be low because the country is struggling economically. Fixed broadband penetration is increasing from a small base as it has continued over the past few years. Penetration has increased by 2.3% in 2012, 3.1% in 2014, 4% in 2016, and is predicted to grow in the next five years until 2021. == Film == \\"Gasa Lamai Singye\\" was the first film movie made by Ugyen Wangdi the founder of the Country's fledgling cinema in 1989. The Bhutanese lama Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche is a well-known filmmaker, who produced and directed The Cup and Travellers and Magicians. While The Cup was shot in a Tibetan monastery in northern India, Travellers and Magicians was the first feature film to be filmed entirely in Bhutan, with a cast consisting entirely of Bhutanese people. No professional actors were used in either film. Historically, films in Bhutan were often adaptations of Bollywood films however in recent years film makers are aiming at defining Bhutanese cinema, nevertheless influence from Bollywood is still a major inspiration. More recently the popularity of Korean dramas have also had some effect on Bhutanese cinema. == References == ==External links== * Newspapers List of Bhutan * Radio Valley goes on air - Kuensel * Bhutan Bhutan ","title":"Mass media in Bhutan"},{"id":"7771875","text":"Indosylvirana aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden frog, is a species of frog endemic to the Western Ghats of India.

Females are larger, growing to long. They have slender bodies with long, obtusely pointed snouts. The head is about 1.3 times longer than it is wide. The nares (nostrils) open to the sides, and are about twice as far from the eyes as the tip of the snout. The distance between them is more or less equal to the distance between the eyes. Vomerine teeth and pineal ocellus (parietal eye) are present. The vomerine teeth are nearer to the choanae than to each other. The oval shaped nares are covered by a flap of skin called the tympanum. The tympanum is about the same size as the eye. The lower rims of the eyes are reddish in color. The tympanum is visible but is not covered by a supratympanic fold. The back (dorsum) of the golden frog is smooth or very finely granulated. It is orange to golden brown in color. It may have small black or brown speckles. A wide, dark brown strip at both sides runs from the nostrils to the rear. A narrow but prominent, bright yellow or gold-colored fold of skin runs from the back of the eye to the hind legs. The upper lip is also golden in color. The underside of the frog is lighter in color than the back, ranging from pale yellow to white. Younger frogs have brighter colors. The fingers are long and slender. The first finger is longer than the second, and the third finger is longer than the snout; the tubercles on the undersides of the fingers are moderately sized. The tips of the fingers possess enlarged discs, with grooves running around each pad separating the top part from the bottom part. The toes are webbed but the fingers are not. The hind limbs are also long and slender without distinct bars of color. The tibiotarsal articulation can reach to midway the eye and the snout. The tibia is about six times as long as it is wide and is about half the length of the head and body. It is shorter than the forelimb but is about as long as the foot. The toes are webbed three-quarters to two-thirds of the way, with the exception of the outer metatarsals, which may be separated almost to the base. The subarticular tubercles are small. They also possess discs at the tips like the fingers. The male possesses an oval humeral gland at the base of each forearm. Their vocal sacs visibly inflate when they call. Golden frogs closely resemble bronzed frogs (Indosylvirana temporalis), making it easy to confuse them. ==Distribution and habitat== Golden frogs are found in a wide variety of habitats, including lentic (lakes, ponds, and pools) and lotic (rivers, streams, or springs) ecosystems, evergreen forests and scrub, bamboo thickets, coastal areas, and rice paddies. They are semiarboreal and semiaquatic. Adult golden frogs are commonly found on rocks or perched on leaves and twigs near bodies of water. They are endemic to the Western Ghats of India, restricted to the south of Palakkad Gap - Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts in the state of Kerala. They can be found asl in India. ==Ecology and life history== Golden Frogs are partially arboreal and partially aquatic. Typically found tropical wetlands, moist and swamp forest, and coastal regions, larvae are often found in running water while adults rest on rocks and other objects in and around bodies of water. From hatching to metamorphosis takes approximately 60 days, and they can be distinguished by observing dark bands on their hind limbs. They are normally nocturnal, though they can become active during light rains in the daytime. The males produce a soft, insect-like call. It can be described as \\"chik chik chik chik chik\\" or \\"pti ri ri ri ri\\" at intervals of 30 seconds. Larger males may have lower calls that can be described as \\"trrrk trrrk trrrrrk\\". Their main breeding season is between June and July. When fully mature, the tadpoles resemble miniature yellow adult frogs with pinkish tails. ==Conservation== Golden frogs are currently classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Their numbers are decreasing due to habitat loss. Populations are also highly fragmented due to the development of land for agriculture. They are currently protected in India by legislation. ==See also== *Indosylvirana temporalis, the bronzed frog ==References== ==External links== *Hylarana aurantiaca from ARKive Category:Frogs of India Category:Endemic fauna of the Western Ghats Category:Amphibians described in 1904 aurantiaca ","title":"Indosylvirana aurantiaca"},{"id":"7771901","text":"Koala Humpback whale A total of 379 species of mammals have been recorded in Australia and surrounding continental waters; 357 indigenous and 22 introduced.Menkhorst, P. and Knight, F.

This ownership structure made BUAF a sister airline of British United Airways (BUA), at the time Britain's biggest independent airline and the country's leading independent scheduled operator. BUAF operated scheduled and non-scheduled vehicle ferry, passenger and freight services. This included scheduled routes from Southend, Lydd Ferryfield and Hurn to ten points in the Channel Islands and Continental Europe. Aviation Traders Carvairs operated what the airline called \\"deeper penetration\\" routes to Basle, Geneva and Strasbourg. Bristol Superfreighters plied the routes to Jersey, Guernsey, Cherbourg, Le Touquet, Calais, Ostend and Rotterdam. The airline's scheduled services between the UK, Le Touquet and Ostend formed part of rail-air operations linking the respective capital cities at each end. These were operated in conjunction with Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer français (SNCF) and Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Belges/Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen (SNCB/NMBS), the respective national railway companies of France and Belgium. (Amongst these, was a six-times daily Southend—Ostend vehicle ferry service operated in conjunction with erstwhile Belgian flag carrier Sabena. This service, which had been launched by Air Charter in partnership with Sabena in 1957 with three dedicated Superfreighters in full Sabena livery and which BUAF had inherited from Channel Air Bridge, continued until 1964.Airliner Classics (SABENA – Belgium's Flag Carrier: Post-War Years), p. 63, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, July 2013) Coach-air services were provided in conjunction with local coach operators between the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland via Calais, Ostend, Rotterdam and Basle.

The first officer, who was flying the aircraft used full power to counteract the effects of a crosswind. Due to a problem with the port engine the First officer decided to abort takeoff as speed approached 80 knots. As the aircraft was going to overshoot the end of the runway he steered it to the left to avoid hitting obstacles. The aircraft became airborne for a short distance, crashing through the airport boundary fence, crossing a public road and coming to a halt a quarter of a mile from the runway end. Although the aircraft was a complete write-off, there were no fatalities among the four occupants (three crew and one passenger). The accident investigators established the probable cause of the accident as the inability of the pilot in command to bring the aircraft to a stop within the remaining runway length, following his decision to abandon the takeoff due to a malfunction of the port engine, .ASN Aircraft accident description Bristol 170 Superfreighter 32 G-AMWA — Guernsey Airport (GCI) The company suffered two non-fatal incidents during the British Air Ferries era.British Air Ferries at the Aviation Safety Network Database Vickers Viscount 806 G-APIM Viscount Stephen Piercey,named after Flight International magazine's former staff photographer Stephen Piercey who died on 20 May 1984 in a mid-air collision during an assignment at the Hanover Air Show was hit on 11 January 1988 by a Fairflight Shorts 330 (registration: G-BHWT), which had suffered a nosegear brake and steering failure while preparing to take off from Southend Airport to Fairflight's Biggin Hill base. The collision destroyed the left-hand side of the Viscount's nose. Although the aircraft was deemed damaged beyond economical repair, it was subsequently restored and put on display at the Brooklands Museum.ASN Aircraft accident description Vickers Viscount 806 G-APIM — Southend Municipal Airport (SEN) The final two recorded incidents occurred during the British World period. One of these involved fatalities.British World Airlines at the Aviation Safety Network Database On 25 February 1994, a BWA Vickers Viscount 813 (registration: G-OHOT) operating an all-cargo flight from Edinburgh to Coventry encountered severe icing conditions en route. This caused the no. 2 engine to fail and its propeller to autofeather while the aircraft had begun its descent from flight level (FL) 150. During that time, the no. 3 engine started losing power as well. In response air traffic control immediately cleared the flightdeck crew to descend to FL070 and thereafter, FL050. The crew attempted to restart the no. 2 and 3 engines but when this proved futile, they elected to divert to Birmingham. The crew did manage to restart the no. 2 engine but this was followed by failure of no. 4. Five minutes short of Birmingham, the aircraft lost all electrical power and as a result radio navigation and intercom. The aircraft struck trees on southwest of Uttoxeter, causing it to break up and kill one of the two pilots.ASN Aircraft accident description Vickers Viscount 813 G-OHOT — 7.5 km/4.7 mi southwest of UttoxeterIcing blamed for Viscount crash, Air Transport, Flight International, 9–15 March 1994, p. 12 The official accident investigation report of the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) identified the several factors as the likely cause: # Multiple engine failures were a consequence of extreme icing conditions. # The flightdeck crew's failure to complete the emergency drills as a result of not referring to the emergency checklist prejudiced their chances of restarting the engines successfully. # The crew's actions to secure and restart the failed engines, which did not comply with the operator's procedures, restricted the power that was available. # The drag induced by the failed engines' unfeathered propellers and the weight increase suffered by the heavily iced airframe caused a loss of height and control before reaching the diversion airfield. # The crew had no contingency plan to avoid the forecast severe icing conditions and was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield that could have been chosen by using ATC services more effectively. This constituted poor crew resource management, which reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing.Air Accidents Investigation Branch — Report No: 3/1995.

He went on to spend the following eight years in the country, almost exclusively with Málaga CF; in the 2002–03 campaign he played for four months with Getafe CF on loan, in the second level. With the Andalusians, Edgar was a heavily used attacking weapon. Having partnered compatriots Duda and Litos for four and five seasons respectively, he eventually appeared in 218 games across all competitions, helping the side to top-flight promotion in his first year. Edgar then returned to Portugal for 2007–08, in a disastrous campaign with Boavista FC – seven matches for the player, Primeira Liga relegation for the club (due to irregularities). He quickly moved abroad again, signing with Cyprus' Alki Larnaca FC, being released after one sole season and retiring from football at age 31. ==International career== Edgar played for Portugal internationally. After earning 25 caps for the under-21s he appeared once with the full side, against Mozambique on 19 August 1998. Subsequently, Edgar had his application to represent Angola rejected in December 2004, because he had already represented one nation at senior level. ==Honours== Benfica *Taça de Portugal: 1995–96 Málaga *UEFA Intertoto Cup: 2002 *Segunda División 1998–99 ==References*National team data * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Portuguese people of Angolan descent Category:Sportspeople from Luanda Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:S.L.

Educated at Llanfyllin High School, after gaining two A levels in Biology and French, he almost joined the British Army but instead went to North East London Polytechnic (NELP) – now the University of East London – graduating with a degree in ecology. ===Career=== After graduation, Williams worked on a farm and then in the timber trade, before joining the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in 1985, staying for 14 years working in the field and as a regional co-ordinator. This led to his making regular appearances in the media, making a name for himself as a leading expert on Welsh bird life. He's also visited many schools and encouraged younger people. In 1997 he made \\"Visions of Snowdonia\\" with BBC Wales, which followed the lives of six people living and working on the slopes of the country's highest mountain. After making a second series, in 1999 Williams decided to leave the RSPB and pursue a full-time career in the media. He presently makes his main appearances on BBC Wales, and with wider Welsh- focused programmes on S4C, in his first language of Welsh, made by independent TV company Telesgop. Known for frequently wearing shorts for his work, he has, as a result, become a Welsh cult gay icon. In 2007, Williams was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Bangor University. He received further honorary fellowships from Aberystwyth University in 2015 and the University of South Wales in 2017. Williams presented Rugged Wales, which aired on BBC Two on 13 and 20 March 2012. In 2019 Williams became a regular presenter on Winterwatch, Springwatch and Autumnwatch on BBC Two. ===Personal life=== Williams and his wife Ceri live near the town of Newtown, Powys. The couple have two sons (Dewi and Tomos); and had two rescue dogs, Ianto and Gwen, who have both appeared in some of his television series. Williams and his wife built a timber-framed home, fully insulated, double-glazed with energy-saving lightbulbs throughout. They have a wildlife garden, and grow their own vegetables. They compost all their food waste, and recycle everything else, whilst always eating organic and local produce. As a result of this, in a World Wide Fund for Nature survey of carbon footprints of ecology personalities, Williams and his family were found to have a low rating of 1.81, compared to a Welsh average of 3.0. ==Filmography== ===Television=== *Natur Gudd Cymru (S4C) *Bro (S4C) *Iolo yn Rwsia (S4C) *Gwyllt (S4C) *Natur Anghyfreithlon (S4C) *Crwydro (S4C) *Canals of Wales (BBC) *Secret Life of Birds (BBC) * Wild Wales (BBC) *Wild Winter (BBC) *Iolo's Special Reserves (BBC) *Iolo's Natural History of Wales (BBC) *Iolo's Welsh Safari 2005 (BBC) *Iolo ac Indiaid America 2010 (S4C) *Springwatch 2010 (BBC) *Rugged Wales 2012 (BBC) *Iolo's Great Welsh Parks 2013 (BBC) *Iolo's Snowdonia 2018 (BBC) *Winterwatch 2019 (BBC) ===Works=== *Blwyddyn Iolo, Gwasg Gwynedd, 2003 *Crwydro, Hughes a'i Fab, 2004 *Wild about the Wild Gwasg Gomer, 2005 *Cwm Glo Cwm Gwyrdd 2008 ==References== ===Sources=== *Llyfr Natur Iolo by Paul Sterry – Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2007 ==External links== * * BBC profile * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh-language television presenters Category:People from Builth Wells Category:Royal Society for the Protection of Birds people Category:British ornithologists Category:British conservationists Category:Welsh environmentalists Category:Welsh television presenters Category:People associated with Bangor University Category:Welsh zoologists Category:Alumni of the University of East London ","title":"Iolo Williams"},{"id":"7771981","text":"Konotopski is a typical Polish gentry family, like many other Szlachta of the Kingdom of Poland and the Duchy of Ruthenia, later prominent in Ukrainian history, science, and arts.

After expanding in the early 1900s it remained a strong part of the state's economy until the mid 1900s. In July 1902, \\"John M. Warner, John Kimple, Louis Mitzell, Levi Starner, Chas. S. Duncan, Charles Emory and David M. Wolf\\" joined to start the Gettysburg Manufacturing Company. The company manufactured eight or more furniture styles (e.g., buffets, sideboards, hall racks and washstands mainly in oak). Following Levi Starner's 1902 death, the remaining owners purchased the company in December 1904. It had become the Gettysburg Furniture Company by 1912. The \\"successor to the Warner Furniture company\\" was the Engle Furniture Company of Michel Engle. In April 1905, they commenced making dressers and later added chiffoniers, buffets, sideboards, and library tables using oak and mahogany. The Engle Furniture Company became the Reaser Furniture Company of Clayton S. Reaser in May 1907, producing over 40 styles in addition to hand-carved pieces. In May 1917 the joint venture Stouck-Reaser Company filed documents for incorporation to buy, sell and deal in wholesale lumber products. In 1918, M. C. Jones was \\"elected manager of both the Reaser and Gettysburg furniture factories to succeed the late Clayton S. Reaser, and Henry Cordes was a local furniture designer. Furniture production remained an important industry in Gettysburg through the 1920s. In 1920 the Gettysburg Panel Company formed to manufacture veneer panels for other firms. In 1923, the Gettysburg Chair Company was chartered to supply chairs that the local factories needed to complete their bedroom and dining room suites. In 1923, the borough's production of furniture totaled almost 71,000 pieces. In 1927 there were 522 employees in the three plants: 261 in Gettysburg, 153 in Reaser, and 108 in Panel. However, the furniture industry declined in the mid-1900s. In November 1951 when the Stouck-Reaser company obtained a permit for a new office building, the other companies were sold to Sidney G. Rose of Cincinnati. The Gettysburg Furniture Company factory closed in 1960, becoming a warehouse and distribution point for Rose's other furniture factories outside Pennsylvania. A facility of the Dolly Madison Industries, Furniture Division, was located in Gettysburg in 1966. ==See also== * American Home Furnishings Alliance ==References== Category:Furniture companies of the United States Category:Gettysburg, Pennsylvania Category:Economic history of the United States Category:Economic history of Pennsylvania Category:Companies based in Adams County, Pennsylvania Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1902 Category:American companies established in 1902 Category:1902 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Gettysburg furniture companies"},{"id":"7772002","text":"Barran is a commune in the Gers department in southwestern France. ==Geography== Barran is located on the river Baïse from the capital of the Gers department, Auch. Barran and its surrounding communes ==History== Barran is a typical example of a bastide, those villages that were erected in Gascony in the late Middle Ages. It was founded by the end of the 13th century. It is well known in the region for the very unusual helical shape of the tower of its church. Not in the village itself but still on the territory of the commune (the third largest of the department in surface area) are several interesting places, like the castle of Mazères, which was the summer residency of the bishops of Auch and then a military hospital during World War I. Close to the castle is the bridge of Mazères, which was built around the 16th century over the river Baïse. In the 19th century Barran was famous for its snails, from which special gums were made to prevent people from coughing. ==Population== Before the migration movement from the countryside to the cities, Barran was quite populous, as was Gers, with up to 2,000 people on the eve of the First World War. Then the population began to fall dramatically, but the trend has changed since the beginning of the '90s: nowadays around 700 people live in the commune, making it the 24th out of 476 communes by population. All basic private and public services (e.g., doctor, grocery and bakery, school, post office, sport facilities) are to be found in the village. The proximity of Auch, the capital of the department, and Toulouse, the regional capital, which is only to the east, as well as the current migration trend toward Southern Europe, should boost the further development of Barran. ==See also== *Communes of the Gers department ==References== *INSEE Category:Communes of Gers ","title":"Barran"},{"id":"7772003","text":"Janet Fairbank (1903 - October 6, 1947) was an American operatic singer.

His paternal grandfather travelled from England to Japan in 1868, where he established an import-export business in Kobe and eventually settled permanently, marrying a Japanese woman. Walter's father was born in Japan, but was educated at Dulwich College in London and, on his return to Japan to join the family business in Kobe, married a German woman from Hamburg. Abraham initially followed in his father's footsteps, completing part of his education at Dulwich College. Mindful of the perils of being foreigners from an enemy state during wartime, in 1941 his parents moved from Japan to Australia and he completed his secondary education at Sydney Boys' High School. == Career == === World War II and early career === After leaving school, Abraham joined the Royal Australian Air Force and was seconded to a small intelligence unit which became known as AIRIND, composed of five Australians who could both speak and write Japanese. Their duties involved collecting and examining engines and parts from crashed Japanese aircraft, in order to deduce when and where they had been made. In the latter part of the war, the intelligence produced by AIRIND guided long- range bombing raids to attack factories involved in military production and thus hamper the Japanese war effort. In mid-1944 the unit was transferred to the control of the Pentagon, and was absorbed into the US war effort. After the war, Abraham studied architecture and town planning at the University of Sydney. He then accepted a post with the now defunct Cumberland County Council. He later returned to Sydney University, where he lectured for five years on town planning. He also assisted with planning Sydney University's post-war expansion, until 1965. === Macquarie University === In 1964, Abraham was nominated as Architect Planner by a committee appointed to advise the New South Wales State Government on the establishment of a new university at North Ryde. He had previously written a report entitled Proposed University Site at North Ryde. Dated 5 June 1962, this is the first written record of his advice on the site, which was to be located around the intersection of Balaclava and Waterloo roads. As part of his preliminary work in 1964, Abraham conducted a comprehensive photographic survey of the proposed campus site, which at that time was farmland. He wrote how he found In October 1964 it was decided that the university would open for teaching in early 1967, and would have a growth target of 1,000 new students each year for the following decade. The new Macquarie University Council decided that the planning of the campus would be conducted internally, rather than by consultants, and as such, an architect- planner's office was established. Abraham was one of the first three staffmembers appointed to the university, and was also one of its first six administrators. He was appointed Architect Planner to the university in April 1965 and was given professorial status so that he could negotiate the university's development on an equal footing with the academic staff. ==== Campus design ==== At the time of his appointment, very little local information was available in Australia regarding the design and planning of universities, and so Abraham travelled to the United Kingdom and United States to study the works of contemporary university campus planners. Rejecting the perceived inflexibility of \\"master plans\\", a concept current at the time, he decided to aim for a balanced and flexible approach to developing the constructed and natural environments of the Macquarie site. Abraham established a grid of lots of 300 square feet (approximately 28 square metres) each, aligned to points of the compass, split into three main divisions: West (W), Central (C), and East (E). Most of the principal buildings were to be constructed along or within easy reach of the campus's main west-east pedestrian way, which became known as University Walk. The measure of 300 feet was chosen as it was seen to represent a 1-minute walk, and Abraham wanted to aim for a design where no two points on campus were more than a maximum 10-minutes' walk from each other. Sizeable parking areas were created on the outskirts of the academic core to the west, south and east, with traffic zones and bus routes running along the north and south of the main southern parking areas W1, C1, C2, and E1. Use of both natural hilly landscape and artificial mounds was made to ensure that the noise of cars and buses did not intrude into the academic area of the campus. A valley on the north side of the academic area which overlooks the Lane Cove National Park was landscaped and kept free of buildings. The panorama was enhanced with the creation of a lake, and carefully designed planting programmes were commenced across campus. The beautiful grounds of Macquarie University today are essentially a product of Abraham's devotion to the art of landscape development. Abraham remained in the employ of Macquarie University for 19 years, overseeing its development and enhancing the development's consistency. He retired in 1983, but remained a regular visitor and observed the continuing development of his creation with great interest. === Other career highlights === While he was still working at Macquarie, Abraham was involved in other significant projects. In 1968, he was appointed to report on a controversial proposal to widen Jersey Road in Paddington, New South Wales, which was being resisted by the local residents. Abraham added his professional weight to the argument, supporting the residents. This led to the proposal being scrapped. In 1974, he wrote a report for UNESCO on physical planning at the University of the Philippines, which resulted in that university receiving loans for infrastructure development from the World Bank. === Retirement === After retiring from Macquarie University in 1983, Abraham and his wife Felicity moved to Kiama, New South Wales, 120 kilometres south of Sydney. Here he designed their house, which was sited on the eastern side of Saddleback Mountain. He became a local identity in the Illawarra region, often giving advice to the local authorities and was a constructive critic of the planning policies of the Kiama Municipal Council. Macquarie University honoured Wally Abraham in 1991, when he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science honoris causa. In 2004 he attended the opening of the \\"Making it New\\" photographic exhibition, a part of Macquarie University's 40th anniversary celebrations which detailed the development of the campus. For a 40th anniversary article in Macquarie University's alumni magazine, Sirius, Abraham wrote Abraham died on 20 August 2006, aged 82The Ryerson Index Retrieved 1 August 2013. (his wife Felicity Prudence Abraham had predeceased him in 1994). They are survived by their children Philip Abraham and Michaela Russell, Michaela's husband Terry Russell, and grandsons Nick and Ben. A motion put by the mayor of Kiama resulted in Wally Abraham being honoured in Council with a minute's silence on 19 September 2006. In early 2006 it was announced that the main west-east pedestrian spine of the Macquarie University campus, formerly known as University Walk, and which had been undergoing extensive renovation and repaving would be renamed \\"Wally's Walk\\" in recognition of Dr Abraham, when it re-opened in April 2006. ==References== == External links == * Obituary in Macquarie University News (October 2006) (PDF document), contains photograph of Dr Abraham in 2004. * Macquarie University 40th Anniversary article in Sirius (Summer 2004) (PDF document), contains some of Wally Abraham's pre-construction photographs of North Ryde in 1964. * Image of Wally Abraham climbing over a dry stone wall on his property at Kiama, in 2001 * Macquarie University Library FAQ: \\"What is Wally's Walk?\\" Category:1923 births Category:2006 deaths Category:New South Wales architects Category:People educated at Sydney Boys High School Category:Macquarie University faculty ","title":"Walter Abraham"},{"id":"7772011","text":"The medial inguinal fossa is a depression located within the inguinal triangle on the peritoneal surface of the anterior abdominal wall between the ridges formed by the lateral umbilical fold and the medial umbilical ligament, corresponding to the superficial inguinal ring. ==Clinical significance== It is associated with direct inguinal hernias. ==See also== * Lateral inguinal fossa ==External links== * - \\"Internal surface of the anterior abdominal wall.\\" Category:Abdomen ","title":"Medial inguinal fossa"},{"id":"7772033","text":"Royal Air Force Station Keevil or more simply RAF Keevil is a former Royal Air Force station located between the villages of Keevil and Steeple Ashton, about east of the town of Trowbridge, in Wiltshire, England. The airfield was built on a site previously ear-marked for the purpose in the mid-1930s. With three long concrete runways, the airfield was used by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces Eighth and Ninth Air Forces. Although no longer a RAF station and now known as Keevil Airfield, it is maintained for military use and used for training purposes, predominantly by aircraft from RAF Brize Norton and Joint Helicopter Command. ==History== === Spitfire assembly === After air raids in 1940 on the Spitfire production plants near Southampton, the Trowbridge area was one of several chosen for dispersal of production. At first parts were made, and later complete aircraft after completion of a purpose-built factory at Bradley Road, Trowbridge. Fuselages and wings were taken on Queen Mary trailers to an assembly shed on the edge of the airfield near Steeple Ashton village, then flown out by the Air Transport Auxiliary. ===USAAF use=== In 1942 Keevil airfield was provided to the USAAF and was assigned USAAF designation 471 (KV). ====62nd Troop Carrier Group==== The first American unit assigned to Keevil was the 62nd Troop Carrier Group, arriving at Keevil on 6 September 1942 from Florence AAF, South Carolina. The group consisted of the following operational squadrons: * 4th Troop Carrier Squadron * 7th Troop Carrier Squadron * 8th Troop Carrier Squadron * 51st Troop Carrier Squadron The group transported military freight and supplies using C-47 and C-53 aircraft. The unit remained in England until 15 November until being transferred to Tafaraoui Airfield, Algeria as part of Twelfth Air Force. ====153d Observation Squadron==== After the departure of the transport group, Keevil saw the arrival of the 153rd Observation Squadron from the 67th Recon Group at RAF Membury in December 1942. From Keevil the squadron flew a combination of Douglas Bostons, Douglas A-20 Havocs and Supermarine Spitfires. In March 1944 the 153d OS was disbanded, then re-formed for duties as the 2911th Bomb Squadron as a liaison and communications squadron, being equipped with Stinson L5s at RAF Erlestoke. ====363d Fighter Group==== left On 20 December 1943, the Ninth Air Force 363d Fighter Group moved to Keevil from Sacramento AAF California. The group consisted of the following operational squadrons: * 380th Fighter Squadron * 381st Fighter Squadron * 382d Fighter Squadron The group awaited its operational aircraft until 22 January 1944 when the group moved to RAF Rivenhall in Essex. ===RAF Fighter Command use=== With the departure of the Americans, the RAF used Keevil beginning in March 1944 for 196 and 299 Squadron. Short Stirling glider tugs of No. 38 Group RAF arrived, followed by a large number of Horsa gliders, crewed by Army pilots of the Glider Pilot Regiment. The RAF Stirling aircraft were crewed by RAF, RCAF, RAAF, RNZAF and SAAF personnel and were engaged in SOE and SAS drops. largely in France, and in glider towing. Their involvement in the Normandy invasion of France and Operation Market-Garden is well remembered by Keevil and Steeple Ashton villagers. Casualties of army and air force personnel were heavy and a number of aircraft were lost. Keevil airfield on 4 November 1956. The secondary runways are deteriorating; the main runway is still being maintained as an auxiliary runway for the USAF. ===RAF Flying Training Command use=== The departure of these units to East Anglia brought Keevil to a training role when in October 1944 No.22 Heavy Glider Conversion Unit arrived, with their twin- engined Albermarle aircraft and Waco Hadrian Gliders. They in turn were replaced in June 1945 by 61 Operation Training Unit converting newly qualified pilots on to Spitfires and, later, on to Mustangs. 61 OTU in due course became 203 Advanced Flying School and moved to Chivenor in Devon in July 1947 and this marked the end of RAF Keevil as a fully staffed and equipped operational airfield. ===Postwar military use=== Between 1955 and 1964 the United States Air Force used the base occasionally. During 1956 and 1957, Keevil was used as a satellite airfield for \\"ab initio\\" training by No 2 Flying Training School, based at RAF Hullavington. Aircraft included the Mk 1 Percival Jet Provost. Keevil was kept in reserve status until 1965 when it was closed. ==Current use== Keevil airfield is virtually complete with all of its runways, perimeter track and many of the hardstands still in place. It is regularly used for British Army and RAF exercises; a monthly flying schedule is published by RAF Brize Norton. Since 1992 it has been home to Bannerdown Gliding Club, a Royal Air Force Gliding & Soaring Association (RAFGSA) club, affiliated to RAF Brize Norton since the closure of RAF Lyneham. The airfield is occasionally used as a motorsport circuit for various events and is also used by the Wessex Model Flying Club. In September 1994 the Keevil Society, organised by Paul Vingoe, held a Commemorative Day to mark the 50th anniversary of the D-Day and Arnhem operations and to dedicate a memorial to all who served at Keevil, especially those who flew from there and lost their lives. In 2012, proposals were made to add a 4th runway parallel to 06/24, a Tactical Landing Zone – a copy of a temporary battlefield runway – by breaking up some of the hard surfaces. The hangar that was used for Spitfire final assembly is outside the present-day airfield boundary at , and is now used by small businesses. ==See also== *List of former Royal Air Force stations ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Freeman, Roger A.

The character was played by Keeley Hawes. Prior to starting her job, Zoe had studied for her degree at Oxford University; this is revealed to Danny Hunter when she is preparing to go undercover in the third episode of series two. One of her main talents was in linguistics, and she is shown translating Serbian dialogue in the first episode of series two. Zoe was a junior case officer in Section D, which she joined shortly before September 1997, and was part of the original leading trio (along with Tom Quinn and Danny Hunter). At the end of the second episode of the show, she moved in with Danny and the two young spooks formed a very strong bond. She also formed strong relationships with Harry Pearce (her boss and someone whom she respected a lot), and Ruth Evershed. Zoe was brilliant at her job and had excellent instincts and charm, which made her particularly suited to undercover work. One of her undercover roles led to her dismissal from the service. Throughout her career as a spook her confidence and morale took a big beating. She was distraught to find out that Tessa Phillips was corrupt, as she had admired Tessa greatly. This was made even worse by the fact that Zoe was very much involved in her downfall. She went through a similar hard time when Tom was alleged to have been a rogue officer. Her confidence took a bigger beating when she and the rest of the team managed to clear his name, only for him to be decommissioned in the next episode. In series 3, Zoe got engaged to a photographer named Will, which led to tensions between her and Danny. In episode 6 of this series, Zoe was seen in court, charged with conspiracy to murder. When she was found guilty, Zoe was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was forced to abscond to Chile, without Will, to avoid being jailed. This led to a very emotional goodbye between her and Danny. Later on, Danny, seeing how Will was suffering, revealed Zoe's fate, and Will left to rejoin her in Chile. The two later sent Danny a postcard, with a picture hidden inside it of them together. In the book Spooks: The Personnel Files, Zoe, accepting the fact she will never see Danny again, set up a PO box for him to write back, and finally expressed her feelings for him. In the meantime, Zoe continues her life with Will, and at the time of writing the message, is pregnant with the child Zoe has always wanted. Zoe uses a tourist she befriended abroad to sneak the message back to Britain hidden inside a utility bill. Sadly, the postcard arrived ten days after Danny was shot dead, so he never knew the depth of Zoe's affections. The postcard was instead re- routed to Danny's mother, and was subsequently intercepted by Special Branch and referred to MI5. The postcard, with certain details redacted, was added to Zoe's closed file, as her identity and whereabouts must still be protected. Harry notes the fact that Danny never knew the depth of Zoe's affections as a sad reminder of the price MI5 officers are required to suffer. The book Spooks: Harry's Diary confirms its existence, and both sources are considered canon to the storyline. ==References== Category:Television characters introduced in 2002 Category:Spooks (TV series) characters Category:Fictional secret agents and spies ","title":"Zoe Reynolds"},{"id":"7772126","text":"\\"Football Crazy\\" is an episode of the British comedy television series The Goodies. This episode was made by LWT for ITV. Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. ==Plot== Football fans have become increasingly violent, and Bill, who is the worst offender, is arrested for disruptive behaviour by Tim (who has become a police officer). It is not Bill's first offence at the football and he proudly stands by during a listing of his previous misdemeanours as a spectator. Tim is of the opinion that the players are also to blame for the violence by the length of their shorts, and by their provocative on-field behaviour after scoring goals. To cut down on the violence, it is decided that the shorts should be longer, and that only one fan be allowed to watch each game as a spectactator in attendance -- with a large number of police to keep the fan in check. Bill is the fan who is chosen to attend, and, being the only fan, he becomes increasingly violent and frustrated during the match because he has nobody to fight with. Later, as a last resort against football violence, the sport is no longer played. However, although football no longer exists, the violence remains, and it finds a new outlet. Tim decides to attend the ballet at Covent Garden. While walking to the theatre, he is worried about the number of violent-looking young men, dressed as sports fans, who are heading in the same direction. Tim is looking forward to seeing the ballet -- but he is not impressed to discover that the violent-looking men are also members of the audience. As the ballet starts, so, too, do the spectators, who are cheering or booing the dancers on the stage. Football spectator violence had become ballet spectator violence -- and violent competition between football teams had now transferred to violent competition between the ballerinas and the male ballet dancers. The Goodies get caught up with what is happening on stage -- Tim becomes a 'trainer', and both Graeme and Bill take part in the dance 'competition', where, dressed as ballerinas with football socks, they dance in opposition to the male ballet dancers. They dance against Aston Villa with their own team being Bill, Graeme, Kevin Keegan, Pelé, Johan Cruyff and Tim as manager. ==Cultural references== Classical music was subject to heckling during premieres, often degenerating into riots. The premiere of The Rite of Spring became particularly infamous for this. ==Notes== This was also the final episode to be filmed, as evidenced by Bill Oldie's shorter haircut and slightly longer ==DVD and VHS releases== This episode has been released on both DVD and VHS. ==References== * \\"The Complete Goodies\\" -- Robert Ross, B T Batsford, London, 2000 * \\"The Goodies Rule OK\\" -- Robert Ross, Carlton Books Ltd, Sydney, 2006 * \\"From Fringe to Flying Circus -- 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960-1980'\\" -- Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980 * \\"The Goodies Episode Summaries\\" -- Brett Allender * \\"The Goodies -- Fact File\\" -- Matthew K.

It is a precise dissection of the mesorectal envelope comprising rectum containing the tumour together with all the surrounding fatty tissue and the sheet of tissue that contains lymph nodes and blood vessels. Dissection is along the avascular alveolar plane between the presacral and mesorectal fascia, described as holy plane (Heald's \\"holy plane\\").Heald RJ. The ‘Holy Plane’ of rectal surgery. J R Soc Med 1988;81:503–80 Dissection along this plane facilitates a straightforward dissection and preserves the sacral vessels and hypogastric nerves and is a sphincter-sparing resection and decreases permanent stoma rates. It is possible to rejoin the two ends of the colon; however, most patients require a temporary ileostomy pouch to bypass the colon, allowing it to heal with less risk of infection, perforation or leakage. TME has become the \\"gold standard\\" treatment for rectal cancer Worldwide. The operation can be done by open surgery, laparoscopic or Robot-assisted. For lower down tumours in the middle and lower third of the rectum a new procedure has been developed known as Transanal-Total Mesorectal Excision (TaTME). Instead of the dissection via the abdomen TaTME combines an abdominal and transanal endoscopic approach (endoscopic instruments are inserted into the anus) allowing easier dissection of the most difficult part of the surgery deep down in the pelvis (particularly in male patients or patients with visceral obesity or a narrow pelvis). The perceived benefits of this technique may include ease of procedure due to better views, decreased operative time and reduced complications. An occasional side effect of the operation is the formation and tangling of fibrous bands from near the site of the operation with other parts of the bowel. These can lead to bowel infarction if not operated on. TME results in a lower recurrence rate than traditional approaches and a lower rate of permanent colostomy. Postoperative recuperation is somewhat increased over competing methods. When practiced with diligent attention to anatomy there is no evidence of increased risk of urinary incontinence or sexual dysfunction. However, there can be partial fecal incontinence and/or \\"clustering\\" – a series of urgent trips to the toilet separated by a few minutes, each trip producing only a very small yield. Depending on the staging, size and location of the tumour, neoadjuvant radiotherapy often combined with chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumour prior to surgery and prevent further spread. Adjuvant chemotherapy may also be used post- surgery to prevent further disease spread ==References== Category:Surgical removal procedures Category:Digestive system surgery ","title":"Total mesorectal excision"},{"id":"7772139","text":":For the station on the former Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway see Neilston railway station.

These plains are a region of prime agricultural land bounded to the east by the Great Dividing Range, to the south by the Liverpool Range and on the west by the Warrumbungle Range. The area is drained by the Namoi River and its tributaries, the Mooki River and the Peel River. There are many depressions, across the plains, which remain as lakes for long periods after heavy rain. These plains are unusual in that many steep hills arise suddenly from the plains. Towns in the Liverpool Plains include Gunnedah, Narrabri, Quirindi, Werris Creek and Tamworth. Smaller villages include Breeza, Carroll, Mullaley and Willow Tree. Most of the region nowadays comes under the jurisdiction of Liverpool Plains Shire Council. However substantial parts of the region also form part of the Gunnedah and Tamworth local government areas. ==History== The Liverpool Plains were initially inhabited by Aborigines. In the 19th century they were mostly Gamilaraay. John Oxley was the first European to visit the area while exploring the Macquarie River area in 1818. The Plains were subsequently named after the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the Earl of Liverpool.The Australian Encyclopedia Vol. V, Halstead Press, Sydney Nowlands Gap, a pass over the Liverpool Range, was discovered by William Nowland and has been described as the gateway to the Liverpool Plains. In the early 1830s, Henry Dangar surveyed and explored the area and made land claims in the name of the Australian Agricultural Company. In 1838, 28–30 Aboriginal Australians were murdered by a group of convicts; seven men were convicted of the \\"Liverpool Plains Massacre\\" (also referred to as the Myall Creek massacre) and hanged.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/31722135https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/31722191 During the 1860s Captain Thunderbolt (Fred Ward) and two accomplices robbed inns and mail-coaches in the Liverpool Plains district.Victor Crittenden, 'Ward, Frederick (Captain Thunderbolt) (1835 - 1870)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6 ==Agriculture== The Liverpool Plains area is typical of temperate woodland regions in south-east Australia. It has an elevation of approximately 270 metres above sea level., p. 32 Most of the 620 mm of rainfall the area experiences each year is high intensity and occurs in the warmer months, from October through March. Rivers run from the Liverpool Ranges in the south-east to the Namoi River valley in the north-east, where elevation falls to 264 metres above sea level. Soils in the area are distinctly black, have a high fertility rating and store a lot of water. They are well suited to growing winter crops such as wheat, but at risk of erosion when cultivated. Agricultural settlement of the Liverpool Plains started in the late 1820s after the pass was discovered and since then it has been one of the prime agricultural regions of New South Wales. The major land uses of the Liverpool Plains are cropping and grazing. The main crops include barley, chickpeas, faba beans, sorghum, sunflowers, soybeans, maize, wheat and cotton while grazing comprises beef cattle and sheep mainly for prime lambs. The more fertile alluvial soils (native grassland and poplar box country) have been cleared, while larger areas of remnant vegetation (ironbark and Callitris pine) remain on poorer sandy and ridgetop soils. The Liverpool Plains are currently under threat by the NSW & Australian Governments pushing approval for the Shenhua Watermark coal mine proposed by Chinese mining giant Shenhua Group. The mine was given approval 15 out of a 17-stage approval process by Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt on 9 July 2015, and will utilise 771 hectares of mine owned land in the region. ==See also== *Agriculture in Australia ==References== ;Bibliography * ==External links== *68 Threatened Species found in the Liverpool Plains Category:Regions of New South Wales ","title":"Liverpool Plains"},{"id":"7772143","text":"Pectineal line may refer to: *Pectineal line (femur) *Pectineal line (pubis) *Pectinate line, border between anal canal and rectum ","title":"Pectineal line"},{"id":"7772149","text":"The Monadnock Ledger-Transcript is a twice-weekly newspaper based in Peterborough, New Hampshire, and covering the Monadnock Region.

Comparisons have been made to the film Donnie Darko, the early comic strip Little Nemo, the works of Marcel Dzama, the film Harvey and the character Nick Bottom from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The first episode, \\"The Giant Vacuum Cleaner\\", was published in 2005. The giant household appliance haunts a cavernous space beneath the Hoover Building in Perivale. The drawing style has more in common with children's book illustrations than with the Marvel Comics aesthetic.

Acalypha is the fourth largest genus of the family Euphorbiaceae, and contains many plants native to Hawaii and Oceania. ==Names== This plant is also known as the Philippines Medusa, red hot cat's tail and fox tail in English, pokok ekor kucing in Malay, Rabo de Gato in Portuguese, Tai tượng đuôi chồn in Vietnamese, poochavaal in Malayalam and shibjhul in Bengali. Acalypha hispida is cultivated as a house plant because of its attractiveness and brilliantly colored, furry flowers. The Latin specific epithet hispida means “bristly”, referring to the pendent flowers which vaguely resemble brushes. ==Origins== The plant originated in tropical Asia, specifically Malesia and Papuasia, but has become naturalized to multiple countries in North America, including the United States, Mexico, and Belize. In cultivation it is widespread, particularly as a houseplant, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==Description== It can grow to be tall, and have a spread of , with potted plants being the smallest in growth. The plant has become somewhat domesticated, due to the nature and color of its flowers. It can be grown from seeds as well as from cuttings. It can be kept either as an outdoor plant or as a houseplant. However, care should be taken in growing it, as all parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested by animals.Idárraga- Piedrahita, A., RDC Ortiz, R. Callejas Posada & M. Merello. (eds.) 2011. Fl. Antioquia: Cat. 2: 9-939. University of Antioquia, Medellín. The plant is dioecious, and therefore there are distinct male and female members of the species. The female plant bears pistillate flowers which are 0.7 millimeters long and range in color from purple to bright red, and grow in clusters along catkins. This feature is the primary reason the plant bears the nickname “red- hot cat tail”. The pistillates will grow all year long as long as the temperatures are favorable. It is an erect shrub of soft stems cultivated by its precious and tiny flowers of a fiery red which in summer hang on pendulous spikes and resemble the tassels of female plants. The leaves are large, oval and bright green to reddish copper.Correa A., MD, C. Galdames & M. Stapf. 2004. Cat. Pl. Vasc. Panama 1-599. Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama. ==Chemistry== The clear latex is poisonous and can irritate the skin and mucous membranes (signs of intoxication do not appear until massive amounts of plants have been absorbed). Roots, leaves and flowers are used for medical purposes. The plant itself is very resistant to diseases, but with a certain vulnerability to aphids, which can colonise it and bring it to death. ==References== ==External links== *Acalypha hispida Burm. f.

The \\"workhouse test\\" was that a person who wanted to receive poor relief had to enter a workhouse and undertake a set amount of work. The test was intended to prevent irresponsible claims on a parish's poor rate. Knatchbull's legislation For Amending the Laws relating to Settlement, Employment and Relief of the Poor marked the first emergence of the workhouse test although this principle was adopted more fully after the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act. Under the act parishes could provide relief as an individual parish, combine with other parishes or poor relief could be sub-contracted out to those that would feed, clothe and house the poor in return for a weekly rate from the parish. Between 1723 and 1750, 600 parish workhouses were built in England and Wales as a direct result of Knatchull's Act. The costs of this indoor relief was high especially when workhouses were wasteful; this led to the passing of Gilbert's Act in 1782. ==References== ==External links== *The text of the Act Category:Poor Law in Britain and Ireland Category:Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1723 ","title":"Workhouse Test Act 1723"},{"id":"7772268","text":"The external spermatic fascia (intercrural or intercolumnar fascia) is a thin membrane, prolonged downward around the surface of the spermatic cord and testis.

It is in the National Gallery in London, which purchased the work in 1868 from Robert Macpherson, a Scottish photographer resident in Rome who, according to various conflicting accounts,Michael Hirst and Jill Dunkerton, Making and Meaning: the Young Michelangelo, National Gallery Publications, London, 1994 at 131, endnote 11. had acquired the painting there some 20 years before. It is one of a handful of paintings that are attributed to Michelangelo, alongside the Manchester Madonna, the Doni Tondo, and possibly the The Torment of Saint Anthony. ==History== The chronological position of this work has been the source of some dispute, although it is generally considered an early work.Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 60. Some authorities believe that it may have been executed by one of Michelangelo's pupils from a drawing by the master or was a direct imitation of his work.Sepoltura di Cristo: La tela incompiuta di Michelangelo (in Italian) According to documents discovered in 1981,Michael Hirst, 1981. \\"Michelangelo in Rome: an altar-piece and the 'Bacchus'\\", The Burlington Magazine, October 1981:581ff. Michelangelo had been commissioned in 1500 to paint a panel for the funerary chapel at the church of Sant'Agostino in Rome, but in the end gave back the sum received. It is probable that this work was The Entombment, which remained unfinished upon Michelangelo's return to Florence in 1501. The subject would be appropriate for a chapel dedicated to the pietà, and in its position it would be lit from the left, like the depicted scene in the painting. The description of the painting in the National Gallery's catalogue suggests that Michelangelo departed to secure the large block of marble that would become his David sculpture, which he undertook to sculpt in 1501. ==Depiction== The centre of the panel portrays the naked body of the dead Christ being carried up a flight of steps to the sepulchre, which was intended to be painted in the blank area in the rocks at the top right of the work. Michelangelo's typically androgynous depiction of the other figures makes it difficult to identify them securely. The bearded older man behind Jesus is possibly Joseph of Arimathea, who gave up his tomb for use as Christ's sepulchre, or perhaps Nicodemus, who assisted with preparing Christ's body for burial. The long-haired figure on the left wearing a long orange-red gown is probably St. John the Evangelist. The woman kneeling at his feet is possibly one of the Three Marys, perhaps Mary Magdalene: a preliminary study of a kneeling woman in the Louvre depicts her naked, with the crown of thorns and three nails. The Louvre also holds a drawing of a naked standing man, which may be a study for St. John. The identity of the two figures on the right is uncertain. Suggestions for the figure standing to the right side of the body of Jesus, supporting it along with St John, range from Nicodemus to another of the Marys, perhaps Mary Cleophas,Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 67. while the figure on the far right may be Mary Salome. The large unfinished area at the bottom right was intended for a kneeling figure of the Virgin Mary. The floating appearance of some of the figures may be partly explained by the fact that the painting is intended to be viewed from below,Andrew Graham-Dixon, “Anatomy of a Genius”, The Independent, 25 October 1994, http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/891 and to the fact that it is unfinished. However, the apparent incongruity of the stance of the bearer on the right remains problematical.Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 69. Many of the unfinished parts of the painting, such as the cloak of the missing Virgin, would have required quantities of the expensive blue pigment ultramarine made from powdered lapis lazuli. If this was in short supply, it could be that this would have held up completion of the painting, which may explain why it was unfinished.Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 70, 123 However, even if this were so, it would not explain why the artist could not have completed the many other parts of the painting that did not require any blue.Philip McCouat, \\"Michelangelo's disputed Entombment\\", http://www.artinsociety.com The composition is a novel one, with the body of Jesus typically held horizontally in paintings of the Entombment, although earlier examples with Jesus held vertically that may have influenced Michelangelo include a 1438-1440 predella to the San Marco Altarpiece by Fra Angelico, and Domenico Ghirlandaio. The upright posture of Jesus may allude to his imminently bodily resurrection, and the raising the sacramental bread at the celebration of the eucharist. The unfinished nature of the work reveals Michelangelo's painting technique, completing areas in turn in the manner of a fresco or tempera work, rather than sketching out the whole work and adding details, as for example Raphael or Leonardo. It also shows areas of paint that Michelangelo scratched away, for example the rocks. The work was in the Farnese collection by the 1650s. After passing through other collections in Rome, it was acquired by Robert Turnbull Macpherson. It was attributed to Michelangelo by the German painters Peter von Cornelius and Friedrich Overbeck in 1864. Initially the attribution was rejected, and it was accorded to the so-called \\"Master of the Manchester Madonna\\" which was itself later attributed to Michaelangelo.

He played for the University of Alabama from 1952 to 1954 and was selected as an All-SEC defensive back in 1952. He worked as an assistant football coach at several colleges, including the University of Georgia and University of Arkansas before receiving a head coaching assignment at Clemson University from 1970 to 1972. He was an administrator with the Southeastern Conference in the 1970s and later served as an athletic director at Florida State University (1981-89) and Alabama (1989-95). ==Early years== A native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Ingram is the son of Wayne and Ella Ingram. He attended Tuscaloosa High School, where he received four varsity letters in basketball and three each in football and baseball. In his senior year, he was selected as an All-State halfback, elected to the All-Fifth District basketball team, and played East-West All- Star baseball in Birmingham, Alabama. He graduated from Tuscaloosa High School in 1951. ==University of Alabama== Ingram enrolled at the University of Alabama in the fall of 1951 where he was a multi-sport star. He won three letters each in football and baseball. He won acclaim as a football player for the Crimson Tide football teams from 1952 to 1954. As a sophomore in 1952, Ingram was selected as an All-SEC defensive back. In December 1952, the United Press International ran a feature story on Ingram calling him the \\"Tide's Honorable Thief,\\" due to his talent for intercepting passes. The story gave warning to Alabama's Orange Bowl opponent, \\"Pre-Orange Bowl warning to Syracuse: beware of Cecil Ingram, an honorable thief. The slender Alabama sophomore safetyman stole more passes thrown by opponents than any other man in the Southeastern Conference this year.\\" His ten interceptions for 162 yards in 1952 (including two returned for touchdowns) tied the Southeastern Conference record for interceptions in a season. He added an eleventh interception in the 1953 Orange Bowl game on January 1, 1953, as Alabama crushed Syracuse 61-6. He also set an Alabama Orange Bowl record with an 80-yard punt return in the 1953 Orange Bowl. During the 1953 football season, Ingram was moved to the quarterback position on an Alabama team that included Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr. He also played at the halfback position in 1953. As a senior in 1954, Ingram played at the halfback position, with Bart Starr filling the quarterback position for the Crimson Tide. In September 1954, he ran 68 yards for a touchdown against LSU. In March 1955, Ingram signed a contract to play professional football for the Philadelphia Eagles, though he never played in any regular season games for the Eagles. ==Football coach== Ingram began a coaching career in July 1956 when he was hired as an assistant football coach at Manatee High School in Bradenton, Florida. At Manatee, he served on the staff of head coach Wheeler Leeth, who had been Ingram's high school football coach in Tuscaloosa. In June 1957, he returned to Tuscaloosa to serve as a head football coach at Brookwood High School. In February 1958, he was hired as the head football coach and athletic director at Tuscaloosa County High School. He then held assistant coach positions at Wake Forest (1960),Waje Forest Media Guide, p. 113 Virginia Tech (1961–1963), and Georgia (1964–1966). From 1967 to 1969, he served as a defensive coach under Frank Broyles at the University of Arkansas, earning a reputation as \\"a defensive genius.\\" In December 1969, he was hired as the head football coach at Clemson University. He served three seasons as Clemson's head coach from 1970 to 1972, compiling a 12-21 record. He resigned as Clemson's head coach in December 1972. He is notable for having introduced the trademark \\"tiger paw\\" logo to Clemson. ===Head coaching record=== ==Athletic director and administrator== After resigning his position at Clemson, Ingram spent eight years working on the staff of the Southeastern Conference, first as assistant commissioner for administration as associate commissioner. In January 1981, Ingram was hired as the athletic director at Florida State University. Ingram remained as Florida State's athletic director until September 1989, at which time he returned to his alma mater, signing a five- year contract as the University of Alabama's athletic director. Ingram hired Gene Stallings as Alabama's football coach, and the Crimson Tide won the college football national championship in 1992. Ingram stepped down as Alabama's athletic director in August 1995 after being reprimanded for his role in rules violations that led the NCAA to place the school on probation for three years. Ingram said he could no longer effectively serve as athletic director after the NCAA's rebuke and asked to be reassigned. ==Honors and awards== In 1991, Ingram was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. In 1999, he was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame. He was also honored in 1992 as a second-team defensive back on Alabama's \\"Team of the Century.\\" In 2007, the University of Alabama National Alumni Association presented Ingram with the Paul W.

The label has had success with a range of artists, including John Mayer, Train, Five for Fighting, Mat Kearney, and Guster. ==History== Aware Records was founded in 1993 by Gregg Latterman with the simple intention to find the best unsigned acts in the country and increase their national exposure through a compilation album. In the fall of 1995, the label formed the inaugural Aware Tour, utilizing its marketing team to pack venues from Nashville to Boston. The first tour built a strong foundation leading to larger, more aggressive, national tours from 1996 to 1999. In July 1997, Aware entered into an agreement with Columbia Records providing the major label with grassroots artist development, and Aware access to national marketing and distribution. By 1998, Aware secured national sponsorship from Levi's and Nantucket Nectars. In 1999, Aware embraced the power of the Internet in the music business and secured sponsorships from Efollett.com and Liquid Audio. The 2003 Aware Tour was sponsored by Ice breakers and featured Toad the Wet Sprocket as headliner, with Aware bands Wheat and Bleu as supporting acts. Aware's joint venture with Columbia Records was renewed in the summer of 2002. Through Aware's relationship with Columbia Records, they have released full-length albums by artists such as Train, Five for Fighting and John Mayer. Aware's rise in the music industry has also afforded the company many unique opportunities. Aware was the exclusive CD retailer for the H.O.R.D.E. tours from 1995–1998 and Woodstock '99. In July 2010 Aware's joint venture deal with Columbia expired; Aware has since signed a new deal with Universal Republic. In 2000 Aware Records starting Internet radio by CJ Hebb through New England Digital Arts. The agreement was that the radio broadcasts would focus on record label artist and royalties would be paid to ASCAP, BMI and SESAC. Internet streaming was broadcast for two years reaching 61 countries and 82 top US markets. Current Aware artists include Mat Kearney. ==A-Squared Management== Formed in October 1999, A-Squared Management (or A² Management) is a separate management division whose current clients include, Emily Hearn, Marie Miller, Mat Kearney, and Mayday Parade. The label currently has just one artist signed (compared to 4–5 at its peak in the early 2000s), while the management division has 4 artists currently under management.

Elaine was created by Carey specifically for the Lucifer series, and her character is that of a young girl with special powers who encounters Lucifer and takes part in the adventures and battles surrounding him. Artist Dean Ormston based the character of Elaine on Vertigo editor Shelly Bond, while her best friend Mona was based on Ormston's wife Fiona Stephenson. ==Fictional character biography== ===First adventure=== Elaine first enters the series as a young girl with the special ability to communicate with spirits of the dead and see into the open minds of others. Her best friend Mona Doyle was recently murdered and her spirit came to reside with Elaine. To find Mona's killer, Elaine summoned the spirits of her three dead grandmothers who guided her in a quest to summon a small demon to punish whoever killed her friend. When the summoning failed, Elaine, in a moment of frustration, tried calling on the devil instead. Her grandmothers' spirits ordered her into silence at once fearing the consequences of such a call. Eventually, Elaine discovered that Mona's old school principal, Mr. Waddington, was the murderer. To cover his tracks, he kidnapped Elaine and tried to murder her, too. However, Elaine was able to poison his drink with an overdose of illegal drugs that he had been selling. As he began to drown into death, she slipped into his mind and began to fall uncontrollably until she was caught by the power of a handsome blonde stranger. She realized immediately that this man was Lucifer Morningstar. He told her that he was keeping Mona's principal alive because if he died, he would take Elaine with him. Lucifer admitted that there were circumstances in the future where he required Elaine to remain alive and well. She looked into Waddington's memory and saw that he had mistakenly thought that Mona uncovered that he was secretly selling illegal drugs. This was the reason that he murdered her. Afterward Elaine returned to her body and Lucifer allowed Waddington to die. Elaine was later found by the police who returned her back to her home. ===Parentage=== Not long after, Elaine's grandmother spirits began to sense danger coming to consume their grandchild. In trying to protect Elaine, they offered to tell her the reason she could communicate with the dead and see into the minds of other people. Fearing the answer, Elaine refused to know. A couple of days later, a man came to her parents claiming to be Elaine's real father. Elaine's dad threw the stranger out and ordered Elaine not to go near him if she saw him again. Elaine went back up to her room to see that her grandmothers' spirits had disappeared. That day in school the stranger reappeared and told her the same thing, claiming that she was stolen from her real birth parents. He called himself Mr. Easterman. A couple of police officers walking by saw him. Easterman ran off to evade them. After an interview with the police, Elaine went off to find Mr. Easterman and located him in an alley where an angel, claiming to be her brother, was beating him up and attempting to kill him. He claimed in his stuttering voice that Easterman would try to harm her. She ordered him to leave the man alone, and so the angel did. Easterman told her that he and her mother had conceived a child together until one night a man appeared by their bed and stole the child from the mother's womb. When they awoke the next morning, it was as if her mother were never pregnant at all. He told Elaine that a blonde well-dressed man visited him in a dream and told him about Elaine being his daughter. She knew at once that it was the devil. ===Origin=== Elaine took Mr. Easterman to a chemist to get him patched up. A phone call to her parents confirmed that she was indeed adopted. Her parents told her that they could not adopt so a man appeared out of nowhere and just gave her to them when she was still a baby. Elaine held Mr. Easterman's hand and through that connection, allowed him to see Mona Doyle's ghost as well. Mona had been searching for Elaine's grandmothers but could not find them. Elaine used her power to sense where the angel who attacked Easterman had gone. They came to an abandoned factory where Mona (against Elaine's wishes) flew inside through the walls to find the old ghosts. Elaine and Easterman went into the factory where they saw Mona's spirit evaporate as she cried out for help. An old man appeared claiming to have destroyed Mona's spirit. Enraged, she sprang toward him screaming at him to bring her back. Easterman recognized this man as the stranger who stood over his wife's bed and stole Elaine from the womb. He was the fallen angel Sandalphon, who told Elaine that Easterman was not her biological father. In turn, he brought her to the next room, which was a balcony that looked down on a giant blonde man over 50 ft high with metal chains restraining his wounded body. He was the Archangel Michael Demiurgos, who led the armies of Heaven to defeat Lucifer Morningstar. He was Elaine's real father. Aside from Michael, all angels were sterile. Using Michael's demiurgic power bequeathed to him by God, Sandalphon began experimenting in the creation of angels. He came close by creating Cal, the angel who attacked Easterman, and finally triumphed when he made Elaine. His plan was to harvest Elaine's ovaries and use them to create an army of perfect angels to lead a second assault against Heaven's gates. Easterman tried to protect Elaine or at least buy her some time to escape, but Sandalphon killed him instantly and went after Elaine. He caught her hiding under the bodies of his other failed attempts at making reproducing angels, but before he could kill her, a familiar voice spoke out behind him. When Sandalphon turned around, he saw Lucifer hovering behind him, and on his back were his restored wings, which had returned to their angelic state. Cal tried to attack Lucifer from behind, but he used his Lightbringer powers to burn Cal. He took both Elaine and Michael, leaving Sandalphon knowing that he would perish if he went up against the Morningstar. Lucifer took Elaine and the injured Michael to his club in Los Angeles, which was being attacked by Heaven's angelic army in an act unsanctioned by God. The raid was led by the angel Amenadiel, who had held a grudge against Lucifer since his betrayal. ===Discovering the truth=== Elaine learned that Lucifer had retired as Hell's ruler to escape God's divine plan. Since then, Heaven discovered a dangerous force had arisen in the form of the old and forgotten silent deities who threatened humanity by granting them their every wish. ====Bargain between good and evil==== Heaven could not intervene against them directly without breaking the rules of creation, so God had sent Amenadiel to present Lucifer (who was now a neutral party) with a payment of his choice in exchange for eradicating the threat. ====Letter of passage==== Lucifer succeeded and ordered his payment in the form of a letter of passage which would open a doorway into the Void outside creation. Lucifer opened the letter inside his club and used blood rituals and the name of God to nail the passage door open. This had caused everyone with a sixth sense of awareness to feel the gate's presence. The sons of Heaven became concerned since the gate was meant to close after one has passed through it. Amenadiel argued that as long as the gate remained opened, it would be a threat. Though they knew that Lucifer was not foolish enough to toy with the gate, there was always the fear that it could fall into the hands of someone who would. ===Lucifer's ultimate plan: new cosmos=== However, their raid had failed the moment they saw Lucifer holding Michael's injured and fragile body. They realized that Michael held inside his body God's demiurgic power which could destroy all creation if Lucifer were to unleash it by breaking him in two. Frustrated, Amenadiel had no choice but to order Heaven's armies to retreat, swearing that their feud was far from over. Lucifer told Elaine to wait for him at the club while he took Michael through the passage gate and into the Void. Michael realized where they were and knew that this was the only place to safely detonate his demiurge power. Lucifer used a sword left behind by Amenadiel's army to strike Michael's body. The explosion was vast and seemed to go on forever. Michael's body reformed after the explosion, completely healed, next to his brother Lucifer. When Michael's consciousness awoke, he realized that Lucifer had used the demiurgic power released from his body in an explosion to form a universe. Michael realized that Lucifer had used him for his own agenda. Only the power of God that was stored in his body and released could produce a second \\"Big Bang\\" and forge an entire universe. Lucifer offered his brother a chance to help him create this new cosmos, but Michael politely refused and went back through the gate to where his daughter Elaine was sitting. ===Shattered faith=== He offered to take Elaine home but she declined, saying she would rather wait for Lucifer. He warned her to be wary of Lucifer and his unending pride. Elaine did not realize that Lucifer had been keeping an eye on her, knowing that she would eventually lead him to Michael. Michael gave her a small black ball that contained her grandmothers' spirits within it, something he grabbed before Lucifer helped them escape from Sandalphon. Michael wished his daughter well and departed. The experience left Elaine with a great mistrust for angels, however, she believed that both Michael and Lucifer were the only exceptions, hoping to see them again. ===To hell and back=== Not long after, Elaine decided to go searching for Mona's soul. She went on to where Mona used to live to try to track her spirit. Elaine was able to astroproject her soul out of her body to search for Mona. Her journey took her past the fortress of the Lillim in Exile and a dimension of demons who pointed her toward the way to Hell's gates. Flying over the pain farms and torture houses of Hell with wings that came with her spiritual self, she did not notice that she was being targeted until it was too late. Lady Lys, a noble woman of Hell ordered Elaine shot down. Once Elaine had fallen, Lys' men strapped her with barbed wire to a rock to have her tortured. Elaine tried to warn them that she was a friend of Lucifer's, but Lys only reminded her that the Devil had retired from his throne. Fortunately, Duma, the angel of silence who had taken over rule of Hell along with his colleague Remiel came to her rescue and returned Elaine to her body, promising her through his silent form of communication that she would see her friend Mona again when the time was right. ===Targeted by the Basanos=== Some time after, Elaine's relationship with her adoptive father eroded to the point that she ran away from home. She was soon found by Gaudium, who tried to warn her of danger to her life; Elaine believed he was lying and fled (after putting him in a trash can). Later, she was attacked by Cestis of the Jin En Mok, disguised as her father, who had been devoured by it. The Basanos had resurrected it in order to eliminate Elaine, whom they felt would be able to aid Lucifer in the future. Gaudium attempted to help protect Elaine, but in the end, Cestis brought a tunnel down on Elaine. She fled her body as a spirit, and escaped to Lucifer's universe with Gaudium. She was just in time to witness Lucifer's defeat at the hands of the Basanos, but was unable to help. She was eventually able to meet up with Meleos, who had brought Lucifer's broken body deep into the mountains to prevent the Basanos from finding them. Meleos tricked Elaine into trading her life for Lucifer's, because he knew only Lucifer could stop the Basanos. As Lucifer returned to life, a crying Elaine was comforted by Death of the Endless. ===Mansions of the Silence=== Due to her wish to be reunited with Mona, Elaine ended up in the Mansions of the Silence after her death. There, both of their souls were tormented by Tsuki-yomi, a Japanese god condemned to the mansions by Lucifer. He used Elaine as bait to draw Lucifer, who sent a rescue party, Mazikeen among them. Unfortunately, they were unable to overcome Tsuki-yomi's ability to alter reality in that place. Eventually, all of them were rescued by Lucifer, who through his mere presence destroyed the Mansions completely, dooming untold billions of souls to destruction. Afterwards, Lucifer asked both girls what they wished to do. After three hours on Earth to decide, both of them asked Lucifer to become guardian spirits of his cosmos; simply to watch and not be worshiped. Lucifer accepted their odd proposal, and set up Mona as the guardian of hedgehogs, and Elaine of everything except hedgehogs. They become known as the Sisters of Mercy. ===Wolf Beneath the Tree=== Soon after that, it becomes clear that Yahweh's creation is disintegrating in his absence. Michael, Lucifer, and Elaine are invited to Destiny's realm to discuss solutions. Destiny inadvertently gives Michael an idea on how to stop the degradation, and he goes to the Silver City, with Elaine following. His attempt to restore the cosmos using his power is only a temporary solution; Fenris the Wolf is heading to the World-Tree to make sure Creation falls. All three go to the World-Tree to stop Fenris, but the journey is very difficult, and all three are injured horribly; Elaine becomes blinded. Fenris is able to trick Elaine into feeding his blood to Lucifer, letting Fenris infect the fallen angel. Lucifer begins to choke Elaine until Michael stops him, and the two fight. In the end, Fenris - through Lucifer - is able to mortally wound Michael. His death means his demiurgic power will be unleashed, erasing existence. He begs Elaine to take the power; Lucifer, having regained his senses, believes it will destroy her, but they have no choice. After Michael says a last goodbye to his daughter, Elaine takes the power, and both Lucifer and Elaine vanish. ===The Yahweh dance=== Elaine is almost overcome by the Demiurgic power passed onto her by the archangel Michael, but with Lucifer's help, she is able to use the power to form a third universe. She creates a world and life, and with Lucifer's help and much trial and error, learns how to be God and use her power correctly. Eventually, once she has learned enough, she is able to form a gate powered by the letters of her own name, so that both can leave her new universe. ===Return and final battle=== Elaine and Lucifer arrive just as Noema, the child of the Basanos is born. After stopping the child from harming Lucifer, they agree to work together. First, they go to Hell to convince the new leader of Hell, a mortal man named Christopher Rudd, to lead his army to defend the Silver City, under attack from the Lilim led by their mother, Lilith. Afterwards, Elaine accompanies Lucifer and Mazikeen to the Silver City. When Lucifer is wounded with a spear by Fenris, Elaine takes all of them to Lucifer's creation to recover, but return almost immediately at Lucifer's insistence. When they return, the armies of Hell have defeated the Lilim, killed Lilith and captured the Silver City. Fenris is still on the loose. Lucifer convinces Elaine to sit on the Primum Mobile and attempt to restore creation. She is interrupted by Fenris's attack. She is then transported outside of creation to Yahweh, who then sets Lilith and her against each other to argue the merits of preserving or destroying all creation. Lilith advocates destruction, seeing creation as nothing but a prison. Elaine refuses to answer, claiming it is impossible for her to answer for uncountable other souls. In the end, it is Lucifer who provides an alternative solution: do nothing. Yahweh must let go, cut the cord, and turn over responsibility. He returns Lilith to death and then passes Creation to Elaine, saying it is her responsibility now. With the help of her friends, Elaine uses the gates to pull both Lucifer's and Yahweh's creations into her own. This new combined universe, where Elaine's name forms the basis, is now safe, and Elaine has taken Yahweh's place as the God of Creation. Shortly after this, in Evensong, Elaine decides to merge with the universe rather than attempt to rule from the top down. ==Powers and abilities== When first encountered Elaine appeared to be a normal human girl with the strange ability to see ghosts. Soon after she discovered her true identity as the daughter of Michael and discovered how to leave her mortal form and also how to manifest a set of wings. After her return from the dead she appears to have total control over at least some aspects of the Luciferverse, and can alter her appearance at will. She mostly takes the form of a young woman in her mid- late teens/younger 20s from this point, but when she is angry she can lose control and reverts to the schoolgirl she was when she first met Lucifer. After she absorbed her father's powers, Elaine accidentally created a cosmos over which she was omnipotent. On the road to the World Tree she loses her sight, but soon discovers how to \\"see in other ways\\". Elaine is able to restore her sight at will as the omnipotent presence of a cosmos that she created as well as retaining full use and privilege of her powers. Elaine's powers are non-transferable and will remain hers even if she should die, become human, change form, regardless of any contract. When she replaces the Presence she becomes the most powerful being in the universe; in some ways, she is the universe and she is able to alter things at will. She also became omniscient after she decided to merge with her universe that she created. As the Presence, she can not be lied to, nor can her mind be manipulated or controlled by others.

Titian had intended it to hang over his grave, and the two stages of painting were to make it fit in two different churches. The picture is among Titian's last, one of several left unfinished at his death. An inscription in the lower part of the picture records that it was finished by Palma Giovane, whose interventions seem to have been kept to the minimum necessary, and doing his best to match Titian's own style.Jaffé, 153; Rosand, 59 A minimalist view of the areas he worked on is that it \\"was limited to the angel with the torch and to touching up the tympanum of the stone shrine\\",Accademia, 180 but the female statue and Jerome's cloak have also been suspected of showing his hand, and he may have touched up the architecture more generally.Jaffé, 153; Rosand, 58–59 The painting is one of a group in Titian's distinctive late style, which begins fully about 1570, though continuing trends seen in earlier works as far back as the mid-1550s. He often kept paintings in the studio for a long period, with several probably unfinished at his death in 1576. His brushwork becomes bold, but imprecise and impressionistic, and worked over many times, as recorded in a famous description by Palma Giovane.Steer, 138–144 The distinction between forms and the space between them almost disappears, and \\"The forms emerge like wraiths out of the circumambient darkness, and mass is reduced to a flickering pattern of colour and light. In his last years only these elements had reality for Titian.\\"Steer, 144 quoted; Jaffé, 59 There is a long-running argument about which of the works of the 1570s have been completed, and by whom. In this case, the main group of the Pietà, in its first form, is known to have been delivered by Titian as finished, and the full expanded composition to have been finished by Palma Giovane. Other important paintings of the 1570s are Tarquin and Lucretia, which was delivered in 1571, the Saint Jerome delivered in 1575, and the Flaying of Marsyas, The Death of Actaeon, the Hermitage Museum's Saint Sebastian and the Crowning with Thorns in Munich, all of which were probably in his studio at his death.Steer, 144; Jaffé, 27–28, 151–153, 164, 166, 172, 178 ==Description== The bottom right-hand corner An original, much smaller, composition just showing the basic two figures of the standard Pietà subject in Christian art, which consists of Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Christ, was expanded after being completed and delivered (see below).Jaffé, 153; Hale, 704–705, 720–721 Behind the central figures there is now a large rusticated Mannerist aedicule or niche, flanked by statues standing on plinths carved with giant lion heads. Along the top of the broken pediment six flaming lamps give a dull light, with another half-hidden in the centre, with vegetation around them, perhaps \\"the figleaves of the Fall of Man\\".Hale, 721 A patch of dark sky can be seen at top left. Three massive keystone-like blocks in the centre drop below even the bottom of the pediment, a feature typical of the Mannerist architecture of Giulio Romano and his followers. These three blocks have been said to represent the Holy Trinity,Hale, 721 or \\"Christ as foundation of the faith\\".Nichols, 8. In reality, they would seem to be more hindrance than help to the structural strength of the niche. Titian's playing fast and loose with the classical architectural vocabulary is shown by the set of guttae beneath the central stone, a breach of architectural etiquette otherwise not encountered until the 19th century. A figure who is either the Nicodemus of the gospels or, as usually thought today, Saint Jerome, approaches Christ on his knees, and reaches out to touch his hand.Nichols, 7; Joseph of Arimathea has been proposed, but he is described as wealthy in the gospels, which does not fit his dress here. Rosand, 60 This is generally agreed to be a self- portrait of Titian.Jaffé, 158; Hale, 722; Nichols, 8; Rosand, 60–61 On the left, standing and completing a right-angled triangle of the human figures,Rosand, 61 is Mary Magdalene, who unlike the other figures seems to be in motion. Whether she has just arrived on the scene, or is rushing away in horror is unclear.Nichols, 7 thinks the latter The two statues at the sides of the grand niche in the background are Moses on the left and the Hellespontine Sibyl on the right, both identified by inscriptions on their pedestals. The Sibyl was thought to have prophesied the coming of Christ and his crucifixion.Rosand, 60; Hale, 721–722; Accademia, 180. Jaffé, 153 identifies the figure as Saint Helena, which would be plausible if there were not an inscription. A putto-angel with a flaming torch illuminates the scene, which is dark and evidently set at night. In particular his torch reveals the gold mosaic in the semi-dome of the niche, where in the centre a pelican feeds its young by pecking its own breast to draw blood, a phenomenon believed since classical times in traditional zoology, which had become a common visual symbol of the Passion of Christ and its redemptive effects for man.Rosand, 60; Hale, 721 (not very accurately) In the bottom right corner a small ex voto picture is propped up against the base of the right-hand statue. It shows two men kneeling in prayer to a Pietà in the air. These are agreed to represent Titian and his son Orazio, probably praying to be spared from the plague that in fact killed them both,Hale, 722; Rosand, 60 a full year after it arrived in Venice.Hale, 708–723; Nichols, 8 Behind the picture, and partly concealed by it, is a small shield with Titian's coat of arms.Hale, 722 In the bottom left corner another young angel is picking up an urn, perhaps the Magdalene's attribute of a jar of ointment. ==History== Titian had always intended to be buried in the church in Pieve di Cadore where he was baptized.Hale, 704 He frequently visited the village, on the edge of Venetian territory in the mountains some 110 km almost due north of the city, although he had left it for Venice over 75 years before his death in 1576.Hale, 3, 14–15 But around 1572 a series of rows with the local authorities there and his relations led him to change his mind, and plan a burial in the large Franciscan church of the Frari in Venice, which contained two of his important early masterpieces, the Assunta on the main altar and the Pesaro Altarpiece on a side wall,Hale, 691–693, 705 nearly opposite the intended site.Rosand, 61 He chose a spot in a chapel with a famous crucifix in it and made the Pietà for it, presenting it to the church. He thought he had an agreement with the friars, but it emerged that they would not move the crucifix, and hung the painting in another chapel. Titian was furious, and eventually got the papal nuncio in Venice to instruct the friars to return the painting to him, in a decree of 1 March 1575. Titian now planned once again to be buried in the church in Pieve di Cadore, with the painting over the high altar, and once the painting was back in his studio he extended it to fit the space there.Hale, 705; Rosand, 57 In 1576 Titian died in the middle of a major epidemic of plague, followed a few days later by his son Orazio, and it was impossible to arrange for the transportation of the body to Cadore. He was at least not buried in one of the mass-graves used for most of the dead, but quietly carried to the Frari and buried there. The painting would probably have been taken to Cadore if Orazio had survived the plague, but with his death the ownership of Titian's estate was disputed between various heirs, and it remained in Venice.Hale, 722–723 The painting was finished by Palma Giovane; it seems he only received it some years after Titian's death, and then had it in his studio for some years. He added an inscription recording his contribution below Christ. Only after Palma's death in 1628 did it finally hang in a church, but this was St Angelo in Venice, which was closed in 1810, and demolished in 1837.Nichols, 11; Late Titian and the sensuality of painting, 310 for church dates. It entered the Gallerie dell'Accademia in 1814.Accademia, 180 The painting has achieved a presence in the Frari as it is one of the five religious paintings by Titian represented in marble reliefs on the large monument to him put up in the church in the 19th century, in the chapel where the painting was intended to hang.photo; the Pietà copy at top left. ==Matching the location== In the Frari the painting was intended to hang in the Cappella di Crocefisso (\\"Chapel of the Crucifix\\"), where Titian was buried, and where his monument now stands. Like his much earlier masterpiece, the Pesaro Altarpiece, which was diagonally across the church, the painting was designed to be viewed in passing by people moving through the huge church, as well as those stopping in front of it. Those entering at the back and moving forward would pass the painting on the second altar on their right, seeing the triangle of figures rising to a termination in Mary Magdalene. Indeed, she looks and gestures roughly in the direction of the Pesaro Altarpiece, further up the church on the other side, while the statues, both looking to the left at a sharper angle, have been seen as indicating the way to the Assunta on the high altar.Rosand, 60–61; Nichols, 10–11 The expansion of the painting to fit the space in Cadore (see below) affected each edge of the painting. To the original two strips of canvas, sewn together, five more were added: one across the whole top, two at the sides, a thinner strip at the bottom, and a small piece at the botton right corner.Hale, 721 ==Analysis== For Tom Nichols, \\"Titian's dramatization of the conflicting emotions of those who witness Christ's death lends his painting its bleakly expressive power. His focus effectively breaks up the usual formal unity expected of a pietà, isolating its protagonists from each other to undermine more abstract possibilities of aesthetic harmony or more resolved theological meaning.\\"Nichols, 7 The Pietà was an unusual subject in Venice, and Titian's choice of it probably relates to Michelangelo's Florentine Pietà, also originally intended to decorate the artist's tomb, with a self-portrait as Nicodemus.Nichols, 9; Rosand, 60 Throughout Titian's career he had reflected the paragone, or argument over superiority in art, with works asserting the superiority of painting over sculpture, within painting of Venice over Florence, and \\"it is not difficult to read the radically pictorial quality of his Virgin and Child as a last attempt to defeat his great rival.\\"Nichols, 9 quoted; Rosand, 60–61 Erwin Panofsky prefers to see it as \\"A lifelong rivalry, compounded of mutual respect as well as opposition, ended in a tribute paid by the survivor to his defunct antagonist — and doing honor to both\\".Quoted by Rosand, 60 There are also elements looking back to Titian's master Giovanni Bellini, for example the mosaic semi-dome, seen in Bellini's San Giobbe Altarpiece of c. 1487, now also in the Accademia.Rosand, 59; Nichols, 7–8; Accademia, 89 for the painting According to Sidney J. Freedburg, it \\"is less a painting about Christian death and tragedy than a splendid and impassioned affirmation of both art and life. Its true protagonist is the Magdalene, salient in a radiance of green against a gold-shot background, who walks out of the picture into the real world, shouting, palpable, magnificent, and one with us in life. She illustrates a cry of grief, but makes the effect of pronouncement of victory.Freedburg, 518 == Notes == == References == *\\"Accademia\\": Nepi Sciré, Giovanna & Valcanover, Francesco, Accademia Galleries of Venice, Electa, Milan, 1985, *Freedburg, Sidney J..

Tumebamba was chosen by the Emperor Huayna Capac (ruled 1493–1525) to be the Inca northern capital. The city was largely destroyed during the civil war between Huáscar and Atahualpa shortly before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in 1532.D'Altroy, Terence (2003), The Incas, Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, p. 31, 75, 78–80 The Spanish city of Cuenca, Ecuador was built on the site of Tumebamba although a portion of the Inca city is preserved at the archaeological sites of Pumapunku and Todos Santos. ==History== The ruins of Pumapunku near the Tomebamba River in Cuenca, The Tumebamba area prior to the conquest by the Incas was called Guapondelig. The ethnic Cañari people had lived in this area for at least 500 years before the arrival of the Incas.Jamieson, Ross W., De Tomebamba a Cuenca, p. 45, https://www.academia.edu/2595174/De_Tomebamba_a_Cuenca_arquitectura_y_arqueolog%C3%ADa_colonial, accessed 20 Mar 2017 The Inca emperor Topa Inca Yupanqui (ruled 1471–1493) incorporated this area into the empire after long and arduous campaigns against the Cañari. His son and successor, Huayna Capac, was probably born in Tumebamba and was responsible for most of the Inca construction in the city. Huayna Capac envisioned Tumebamba as the northern capital of the Inca Empire and modeled the construction on that of Cuzco, the Inca capital.Niles, Susan A. (1999), The Shape of Inca History, Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, p. 253. Downloaded from Project Muse. Huayna Capac had a royal palace here.de la Vega, G., \\"El Inca\\", 2006, Royal Commentaries of the Incas and General History of Peru, Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Co., Inc., Spanish stories that Huanya Capac had building stones transported from Cuzco to Inca centers, including Tumebamba, in present-day Ecuador were confirmed in 2004. Archaeologists identified stone building blocks in Ecuador that had an origin in a quarry near Cuzco. The scholars found 450 stones, weighing up to each, that had been transported more than on Inca roads traversing the high and rugged Andes. The Incas lacked draft animals and wheeled vehicles so the transport was by manpower only, possibly by laborers conscripted by the Incas among the peoples who had opposed their rule. The monumental task of transporting the stones also indicates the priority Huayna Capac placed on making Tumebamba an alternative or secondary capital of the empire.Ogburn, Dennis (Winter 2004), \\"Power in Stone: The Long-Distance Movement of Building Blocks in the Inca Empire,\\" Ethnology, Vol. 51, No. 1, pp. 131–132 In the words of a scholar, \\"These stones embodied the transfer of sanctity and power from the imperial capital to the city of Tomebamba in Ecuador, while their movement was a major public demonstration of state control over labor.\\" The Inca also quarried building stones at Cojitambo, in a straight line distance northeast.Ogburn. p. 101, 123 Huayna Capac and many other Incas died in an epidemic (probably of a European-introduced disease) about 1525 and his sons Huascar and Atahualpa contested the succession. Several battles in the civil war which followed were near Tumepampa and the Inca city was largely destroyed.D'Altroy, p. 259 The Cañari inhabitants had taken the side of Huascar and were severely treated by Atahualpa. ==Pumapunku and Todos Santos== The Spanish chronicler Pedro Cieza de León visited Tumebamba in 1547 and said, \\"Everything has crumbled and in ruins but you can still appreciate how grand it was.\\"Jamieson, p. 50 The city of Cuenca has been built on top of the old Inca city and whatever ruins remain are largely buried.Niles, p. 253 The two surviving remnants of the Inca city are the ruins of Todos Santos and Pumapunku (or Pumapongo). The two ruins are within about of each other and near the Tomebamba River. Neither site has the finely-worked stone characteristic of Cuzco, perhaps meaning that these sites were of secondary importance in the Inca city and that the principal temple and plaza has disappeared beneath later construction. Based on finding spinning tools in the buildings excavated at Pumapunku, the site may have a residence for aclla, the sequestered women of the Incas. A large artificial water pool, terraces, and canals resemble those at Quispiguanca, a royal estate of Huayna Capac in the Sacred Valley near Cuzco. The Manuel Agustín Landivar Museum is adjacent to the Todos Santos ruins and the Pumapongo Museum and Archaeological Park is at the Pumapunku ruins. xco.Niles, pp. 257–258 Both feature exhibits about the Indigenous people of the Americas, the Cañari, the Inca, and the early Spanish settlers.

Initially, the 7R was not quite as powerful as its competitors, producing at 7500 rpm. The duplex frame and Teledraulic front forks remained relatively unchanged during production, while the engine had a number of changes. The included valve angle was progressively narrowed, and the crankshaft strengthened. In 1956 the engine dimensions changed from the original long-stroke 74 x 81 mm to the ‘squarer’ 75.5 x 78 mm. The AMC gearbox replaced the older Burman unit in 1958. ==AJS 7R3== In 1951 AJS development engineer Ike Hatch developed a 75.5 mm bore x 78 mm stroke, three valve head version of the 7R making .

From 1996 to 2003 he was the editor at The Irish Catholic. He served as the religious and social affairs correspondent for the Irish Independent from 2003 to 2005. He has often appeared on Irish current affairs programmes. Since 2007, Quinn has been the Director of the Iona Institute advocacy group. Quinn has campaigned against the liberalisation of Irish abortion laws, the introduction of same- sex marriage and the legalisation of assisted suicide. He is a member of the Dublin branch of Legatus, which promotes Catholic values in corporate business, for those who meet stringent qualification criteria. He was educated at St Paul's College, Raheny and studied at NIHE Dublin (now Dublin City University), graduating with a degree in Business Studies. He is also a regular contributor to the Irish edition of The Sunday Times. ==Activities== ===Iona Institute=== In January 2007 Quinn founded the Iona Institute, a Roman Catholic advocacy group promoting families based on traditional marriage and the practice of religion. He is the current Director of the Iona Institute. ===Abortion=== David Quinn supported Ireland's previous near total ban on abortion, and has appeared many times in popular debates on the topic of abortion in Ireland, to defend the Eighth Amendment. ===Euthanasia=== David Quinn has campaigned against the legalisation of euthanasia. ===LGBT rights=== Quinn has spoken in favour of Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act, which allows religious schools to discriminate, and fire employees who don't match their ethos, which can be used to fire gay teachers in Catholic schools, with the Iona Institute recommending that it be kept. He is opposed to Ireland's Gender Recognition Act for transgender people. In 2010, he was opposed to legal recognition of same-sex in the form of civil partnerships. He campaigned unsuccessfully for a No vote in the 2015 same-sex marriage referendum In the course of the referendum campaign, Professor John A. Murphy, an Irish historian and former member of Seanad Éireann, wrote to The Irish Times. In his letter, he described the constitutional amendment, which permitted same- sex marriage and extended constitutional protection to families based on such marriages, as \\"grotesque nonsense.\\". Following this, Mr Quinn tweeted \\"Proposed change to marriage \\"grotesque nonsense\\"... Great letter by Prof John A Murphy in @IrishTimes today #MarRef\\". Mr Quinn was criticised for this Tweet by drag queen and gay rights activist Rory O'Neill (also known by his stage name, Panti Bliss), who wrote: \\"I can think of lots of things that are grotesque. Extending constitutional protection to all families is not one of them... I would call it 'fair', 'reasonable', 'compassionate', 'considerate', 'respectful', or even 'the very least we can do'. But not 'grotesque'.\\" ==See also== * LGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland * Abortion in the Republic of Ireland * Patricia Casey * Breda O'Brien * Maria Steen * Cora Sherlock * Iona Institute ==References== ==External links== * David Quinn's columns in the Irish Independent * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Conservatism in Ireland Category:Daily Mail journalists Category:Irish columnists Category:Irish Independent people Category:Irish newspaper editors Category:Irish anti-abortion activists Category:Irish Roman Catholics Category:Business Post people Category:The Wall Street Journal people Category:Alumni of Dublin City University Category:People educated at St Paul's College, Raheny ","title":"David Quinn (columnist)"},{"id":"7772517","text":"Juniper Bank was a direct bank based in Wilmington, Delaware.

It is a Cross Of Nails school, with links to schools all over the world. == Context == Part of the old site of Blue Coat School Blue Coat Church of England School is a specialist Music, Maths and Science college. The original Blue Coat school was founded in 1714 as a school for girls and was located close to Holy Trinity church in the city centre of Coventry. The original school site is also close to the ruins of St Mary's Priory and Cathedral, which can be seen in the photo of the old site. A new school was opened on the present site in 1964 under headmaster William J Grimes, who ran the school until his retirement in 1980, replaced by Rev R Lewie as Head until 1986. From 1994 to 1999, Dr. R. Lewin was headteacher, preceding Stephen Timbrell, who was the headteacher from 1999 until 12 May 2008. Dr J.Roberts became headteacher in September 2009 but left the school in 2015, when Mr F. Peacock became interim headteacher. In 2016 Mrs Shelley became the new headteacher of Blue Coat. Mr F. Peacock still works at Blue Coat school as a history teacher. Current enrollment is around 1460 pupils, and the school gained an outstanding SIAMS grading in July 2015. It is one of very few specialist Music Colleges in the country. The school has ties with Coventry Cathedral, and holds several services there every year. ==Year and school councils== At the start of the school year, each form elects several representatives to serve on the year council. Two or three of these year council representatives are elected to serve on the school council. The year councils discuss issues regarding school life and pass their findings to the school council, who consider them. The school council has a budget to facilitate resolution of these issues as long as they support the Christian ethos of the school. == Choir == The school has an eight-part choir, typically performing choral works ranging from the early works of Thomas Tallis through Joseph Haydn's Insanae et Vanae Curae to the recent works of composers such as John Tavener. The choir visits cathedrals around the country annually, where it sings services for the week whilst the resident choir is away. These have included Chester, York, Blackburn, Salisbury, and Liverpool. The choir has sung mass in St Mark's Basilica, Venice. In the summer of 2007 the choir visited Wells Cathedral. Other choir activities have included: * 2010: During the summer the choir sang services in Wells Cathedral. Whilst they were there a CD was recorded, which is still available to purchase from the school's Music Department. * 2011: The choir sang services at York Minster during the summer. The boys section were selected to appear film, 'Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger.\\" Part of the storyline involved having David Tennant as conductor. Venues for the filming were Warwick Castle, Bablake School, and the Courtyard Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. * 2012: As part of Coventry Cathedral's Golden Jubilee celebrations, a group of senior members performed in front of a congregation of 2000, which included the Princess Royal and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The choir sang services at Salisbury Cathedral during the summer. * 2014: The choir performed in front of 2000 at Stoneleigh Park, for a farming event. They also sang many times at Coventry Cathedral, which they do many times a year. The choir receives additional support from members of the public who bolster the ranks when support is required, providing a more balanced bass and tenor sound. The choir has been entering the BBC Songs of Praise School Choir of the Year competition for the last three years, and has come close to winning several times, with the Choir winning the competition in the 2008 finals. The choir is a regular on the BBC Radio 4 programme The Daily Service. ==Dramatic productions== The school has at least three annual dramatic productions. There is an annual musical open to all students, recent productions include 'We Will Rock You', 'The Wiz' and 'Hairspray'. There is a production for students in key stages 4 and 5 such as 'Sleeping Beauty', 'Lord of the Flies', ' The Lady Killers' and 'The Good Person of Schezuan'. Also, an annual production for students in key stage 3, recently 'The Comedy of Errors', 'Ignite' and 'The Canterbury Tales'. The school took a production to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017, 'One Good Soul'. There are also bespoke community drama projects in partnership with a range of organisations and student directed productions. ==Uniform== The current Blue Coat School uniform for Years 7-11 consists of: School blazer, white shirt, black trousers or regulation skirt, House tie, black, grey or white socks, black shoes. ==Financial crisis 2015== It was announced in a letter home to parents on 5 March 2015 the whole governing body of the school was to step down to make way for an interim governing body as the school was facing \\"serious financial issues\\". The school has put a small number of support posts at risk. On BBC CWR's radio Breakfast show on 5 March 2015 there were calls from parents for Head Dr Julie Roberts to stand down. The BBC later reported that there was a £1.4 million shortfall in funding. In May 2015 after being put on special leave Dr Julie Roberts resigned. As of the end of 2018, the school is £668,000 in debt to the Education and Skills Funding Agency. == House System == Under Victoria Shelley, the school has implemented a new house system. The houses are named Cavell, Dorsey, Lewis, Parks and Wilberforce. These were chosen to reflect the schools six values: Care, Hard work, Respect, Integrity, Servanthood and Togetherness, an acronym for CHRIST. Tutorials are based on house systems, and contain students from a variety of years to promote inter- year coherence. It also affects the tie a student wear - each house is designated a colour, and each tie has different coloured stripes. Much like other schools with house systems, there are heads of each house, and prefects (student support members) under each head. Previously, from the era when the school was lead by Mr. Grimes, the school was divided into three traditional houses named after Bishops of Coventry: Neville Gorton, Mervyn Haig, and Cuthbert Bardsley. The houses were identified by the colours red, green, and blue respectively. Each house had two classes numbered by the year and lettered by the first or last name of the respective bishop. For example, as student might enter in Form 1C in their first year, progress to 2C for the second, 3C for the third etc. Students did not change classes each year and so spent five years with the same group of children. The homerooms of each class were localized to the three separate main buildings of the school, but tuition took place across the whole facility based on subject. The houses were further subdivided into a \\"lower school,\\" comprising years 1, 2, and 3, and an \\"upper school,\\" comprising years 4 and 5. The house system was not used in the sixth form, which was a single unit with a \\"lower sixth\\" and \\"upper sixth\\" for organizational purposes. ==References== ==External links== *Blue Coat Website Category:Secondary schools in Coventry Category:Bluecoat schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1714 Category:1714 establishments in England Category:Church of England secondary schools in the Diocese of Coventry Category:Academies in Coventry Category:Coventry Cathedral ","title":"Coventry Blue Coat Church of England School"},{"id":"7772591","text":"Harakah is a newspaper founded in 1987 and published by PAS.

He died in 2006. During the 52nd PAS Youth Muktamar which was held in November 2012, Nasrudin Hassan of PAS Youth demanded that the editorial line-up of the newspaper should be restructured and wants a committee to be set up to censor the editorial content of the newspaper and its online portal Harakahdaily. PAS Youth claims that the newspaper has lost its credibility and derailed from its own purpose. Nasrudin claims that it no longer carries the aspiration of the jamaah to propel the Islamic movement of the 21st century.

The title is a play on \\"poems\\" and pommes (the French word for apples) which are here offered at \\"a penny each\\" in either currency. It was the custom for Irish tradespeople of the time to offer their customers a \\"tilly\\" (in Irish, tuilleadh) or extra serving – just as English bakers had developed the tradition of the \\"baker's dozen\\", offering thirteen loaves instead of twelve. The first poem of Pomes Penyeach is entitled \\"Tilly\\" and represents the bonus offering of this penny- a-poem collection. (The poem was originally entitled \\"Cabra\\", after the Cabra district of Dublin where Joyce was living at the time of his mother's death.) The poems were initially rejected for publication by Ezra Pound. Although paid scant attention on its initial publication, George Slocombe, who reviewed Pomes Penyeach in the Daily Herald, was assured by Joyce that he had the \\"melancholy distinction\\" of being the only reviewer. this slender volume (which contains fewer than 1000 words in total) has proven surprisingly durable, and a number of its poems (particularly \\"Tilly\\", \\"A flower given to my daughter\\", \\"On the beach at Fontana\\", and \\"Bahnhofstrasse\\") continue to appear in anthologies to this day. Seamus Heaney and Ted Hughes, for example, include \\"Tilly\\", \\"On the beach at Fontana\\" and \\"A flower given to my daughter\\" in their popular anthology, The Rattlebag. Pomes Penyeach contains a number of Joycean neologisms (\\"rosefrail\\", \\"moongrey\\" and \\"sindark\\", for example) created by melding two words into a new compound. The word \\"love\\" appears thirteen times in this collection of thirteen short poems (and the word \\"heart\\" appears almost as frequently) in a variety of contexts. Sometimes romantic love is intended, in tones that vary from sentimental or nostalgic (\\"O sighing grasses,/ Vainly your loveblown bannerets mourn!\\") to scathing (\\"They mouth love's language. Gnash/ The thirteen teeth/ Your lean jaws grin with\\"). Yet at its best Joyce's poetry achieves, like his prose, a sense of vitality and loving compassion. (\\"From whining wind and colder/ Grey sea I wrap him warm/ And touch his trembling fineboned shoulder/ And boyish arm. // Around us fear, descending/ Darkness of fear above/ And in my heart how deep unending/ Ache of love!\\") ==Contents== The contents of Pomes Penyeach are listed below, with the date and place of each composition: \\"Tilly\\" (Dublin, 1904; originally known as \\"Cabra\\") \\"Watching the Needleboats at San Sabba\\" (Trieste, 1912) \\"A Flower Given to My Daughter\\" (Trieste, 1913) \\"She Weeps over Rahoon\\" (Trieste, 1913) \\"Tutto è sciolto\\" (Trieste, 13 July 1914) \\"On the Beach at Fontana\\" (Trieste, 1914) \\"Simples\\" (Trieste, 1914) \\"Flood\\" (Trieste, 1915) \\"Nightpiece\\" (Trieste, 22 January 1915) \\"Alone\\" (Zurich, 1916) \\"A Memory of the Players in a Mirror at Midnight\\" (Zurich, 1917) \\"Bahnhofstrasse\\" (Zurich, 1918) \\"A Prayer\\" (Paris, 1924) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1927 poetry books Category:Irish poetry collections Category:Poetry by James Joyce ","title":"Pomes Penyeach"},{"id":"7772650","text":"A rasika is a term for an aesthete of Indian classical music.

The island is grouped with Western Australia but is administered by the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities and an Administrator. The Shire covers an area of 14.1 km² in the Indian Ocean, about 2,770 km north-west of Perth and 1,000 km south-west of Java in Indonesia. The current shire president is Seriwati Iku, who was elected in October 2017 as the first woman to hold the position. ==History== From the 19th century onwards, the islands were owned by the Clunies-Ross family, and in 1886 were granted to them in perpetuity by Queen Victoria. On 23 November 1955 the islands were transferred to Australian control under the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. In 1978, Australia entered a form of purchase of the islands with the Clunies-Ross family, and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Council came into existence in July 1979 as a representative of the Cocos Malay community. ==Administration== The Administrator is Natasha Griggs, who was appointed on 5th October 2017 and is also the Administrator of Christmas Island. These two Territories comprise Australia's Indian Ocean Territories. The Australian Government provides Commonwealth-level government services through the Indian Ocean Territories Administration and the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities. As per the Federal Government's Territories Law Reform Act 1992, which came into force on 1 July 1992, Western Australian laws are applied to the Cocos Islands, \\"so far as they are capable of applying in the Territory\\";Territories Law Reform Act 1992. Comlaw.gov.au. Retrieved 16 July 2013. non-application or partial application of such laws is at the discretion of the federal government. The Act also gives Western Australian courts judicial power over the islands. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands remain constitutionally distinct from Western Australia, however; the power of the state to legislate for the territory is a power delegated by the federal government. The kind of services typically provided by a state government elsewhere in Australia are provided by departments of the Western Australian Government, and by contractors, with the costs met by the federal government. There also exists a unicameral Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council with seven seats. A full-term lasts four years, though elections are held every two years; approximately half the members retire each two years, alternating elections of three and four members for a total of seven. The first elections to the Shire Council, established by ordinance, were held in May 1993. The shire has seven councillors and no wards. The Shire's offices are at Jalan Bunga Kangkong, Home Island.

Ray Morrison (February 28, 1885 – November 19, 1982) was an American football and baseball player and a coach of football, basketball, and baseball. He served as the head football coach at Southern Methodist University (1915–1916, 1922–1934), Vanderbilt University (1918, 1935–1939), Temple University (1940–1948), and Austin College (1949–1952), compiling a career college football record of 155–130–33. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954. As a player, he was one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of Vanderbilt Commodores football. Morrison was selected as the quarterback and kick returner for an Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869–1919 era. He piloted the team to two Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) titles in 1910 and 1911. The 1910 team fought defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Yale coach Ted Coy called Morrison \\"the greatest player I have seen in years.\\" In 1911, Coy selected Morrison All-American and the Atlanta Constitution voted Vanderbilt the best backfield in the South. He took over as coach at his alma mater Vanderbilt after the retirement of legendary coach Dan McGugin. Morrison was the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Coach of the Year in 1937. He was also the first head coach in the history of SMU Mustangs football, and helped popularize the forward pass in the Southwest with his \\"Flying Circus\\" teams, most notably when led by Gerald Mann. ==Early years== Ray Morrison was born on February 28, 1885 in Sugar Branch, Indiana. Soon after the family moved to McKenzie, Tennessee, where Morrison attended school. He also spent a year at McTyiere School for Boys. ==Vanderbilt University== To achieve funds for college, Morrison worked on a dredge boat on the Mississippi River for a year. Morrison won Bachelor of Ugliness for the class of 1912. He played on the football and baseball teams with his brother Kent. ===Football=== He played football as a prominent quarterback and halfback for Dan McGugin's Vanderbilt football teams from 1908 to 1911. He is considered one of the best quarterbacks in Vanderbilt's long history. The team posted a 30–6–2 record during his four years. He was selected for an all-time Vanderbilt team in 1934. Morrison was selected as the quarterback and kick returner for an Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869–1919 era. He weighed some 155 to 159 pounds. ====1908==== The 1908 squad was hampered by a wealth of sophomores, which McGugin with the help of halfback Morrison led to a 7–2–1 campaign, including a loss to rival Sewanee. In a 16-9 defeat of Tennessee, widely considered their greatest team at that point, Walker Leach got loose for a 60-yard run on a fake kick, tracked down by Morrison and stopped short of the goal. ====1909==== The 1909 team lost to SIAA champion Sewanee, its first loss to a Southern team in six years. ====1910==== The 1910 team won the SIAA title and fought defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie on Yale Field. Yale coach Ted Coy called Morrison \\"the greatest player I have seen in years.\\" He was selected All- Southern by several writers. Vanderbilt won a close game over Mississippi 9–2. Late in the first quarter, Morrison returned a punt 90 yards for Vanderbilt's touchdown. John Heisman was the game's field judge, and McGugin did not want to show too much, playing Heisman's Georgia Tech in two weeks. Morrison was the star of the Georgia Tech game, scoring two touchdowns. ====1911==== alt= Edwin Pope's Football's Greatest Coaches on the 1911 team reads \\"A lightning- swift backfield of Lew Hardage, Wilson Collins, Ammie Sikes, and Ray Morrison pushed Vandy through 1911 with only a 9–8 loss to Michigan.\\" The Atlanta Constitution voted it the best backfield in the South. Ted Coy selected Morrison All-American. He was unanimously selected All-Southern. Morrison, Hardage and Rabbi Robins had two touchdowns each in a 45-0 win over Central. Morrison had two short touchdown runs in a 17-0 win over Georgia, and had a 22-yard run on a fake punt. In \\"easily the greatest southern game of the season\\", Vanderbilt claimed the SIAA title by beating Mississippi 21-0\\\\. Morrison had a 70-yard run, and on a fake punt out of his own end zone ran for 75 yards. Against Sewanee, Morrison threw a touchdown pass to Hardage, as well as had a short touchdown run. ===Baseball=== Morrison also played on the baseball team, moved to the outfield from catcher in his junior year, and back to catcher as a senior. The 1910 and 1912 teams won the SIAA. Morrison was captain of the 1912 team. ==Coaching years== Morrison first taught and was athletics director at Branham & Hughes Military Academy in Spring Hill. Upon American entry into World War I, Morrison went to Fort Oglethorpe. In 1919, Morrison spent a year at Gulf Coast Military Academy as athletics director and teacher. ===SMU=== Ray Morrison was the first head coach in the history of SMU Mustangs football. He won just two games in two years from 1915 to 1916. ====Return ==== In 1920, Morrison returned to SMU. He notably brought the forward pass to the southwest during his time at SMU. Morrison was one of the first to pass not just on first down, but on first and second down too. His teams earned the nickname the \\"Flying Circus\\". They won the 1923, 1926, and 1931 Southwest Conference (SWC) titles. An 18-game unbeaten streak was ended in the 1925 Dixie Classic, with a touchdown off a tipped pass for West Virginia Wesleyan's Gale Bullman, and a 30-yard field goal missed in the final minute. Morrison's best passer, Hall of Fame quarterback Gerald Mann, led the team to the 1926 title. The 1929 team was undefeated, but with four ties, including one with undefeated TCU to close the season. ===Vanderbilt=== He coached Vanderbilt in 1918 when McGugin left for the military, and led the Vanderbilt team to a 4–2 record. The team beat Tennessee 76-0, the largest margin of victory in the history of the rivalry. Former Nashville Banner sportswriter Fred Russell's book Fifty Years of Vanderbilt Football published in 1938, wrote: \\"Salient after salient was wiped out by Gen. Morrison's forces and Tennessee's reinforcements could not check the tide. The retreat turned into a bloody, hopeless rout. Berryhill was cited for bravery for his wonderful outflanking the enemy, by which he took six positions (touchdowns) single-handedly. The result was 76−0.\\" Morrison was also the head basketball coach at Vanderbilt for one season in 1918–19, tallying a mark of 8–2, and the head baseball coach at the school in 1919, notching a record of 3–3. ====Return==== Upon the retirement of the legendary McGugin, Morrison was hand-picked as successor at his alma mater. Morrison brought his own staff from SMU and neglected the retained Josh Cody's coaching abilities. Fred Russell offered this description of Morrison upon his arrival as coach of Vanderbilt: Morrison's first team in his second stint finished second place in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), led by captain and SEC player of the year Willie Geny. The 1936 team was captained by Dick Plasman, the last NFL player to play without a helmet. The 1937 team upset LSU on a hidden ball trick, the school's first-ever victory over a ranked opponent (the AP Poll began in 1936). The team's captain was SEC player of the year Carl Hinkle and also featured Baby Ray. Morrison was awarded SEC Coach of the Year in 1937. ===Temple=== After the 1939 season, Morrison resigned from his position at Vanderbilt to go to Temple, with Cody as his line coach. He resigned from Temple in 1949. ===Austin College=== He finished his career at Austin College. He quit to take over \\"development and public relations\\" at SMU, a post he held for eleven years. ==Death== Morrison died at the home of his son in Miami Springs, Florida at the age of 97. ==Head coaching record== ===Football=== ==See also== * List of college football head coaches with non-consecutive tenure ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== * Category:1885 births Category:1982 deaths Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Baseball catchers Category:Baseball outfielders Category:Austin Kangaroos football coaches Category:SMU Mustangs football coaches Category:Temple Owls football coaches Category:Vanderbilt Commodores baseball coaches Category:Vanderbilt Commodores baseball players Category:Vanderbilt Commodores football coaches Category:Vanderbilt Commodores football players Category:Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball coaches Category:All-Southern college football players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:People from Switzerland County, Indiana Category:Players of American football from Indiana Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:Basketball coaches from Indiana Category:People from McKenzie, Tennessee ","title":"Ray Morrison"},{"id":"7772709","text":"The mediastinum testis is a network of fibrous connective tissue that extends from the top to near the bottom of each testis.

The model is a generalization of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). While the CAPM is derived in a static, one-period setting, the CCAPM uses a more realistic, multiple-period setup. The central implication of the CCAPM is that the expected return on an asset is related to \\"consumption risk,\\" that is, how much uncertainty in consumption would come from holding the asset. Assets that lead to a large amount of uncertainty offer large expected returns, as investors want to be compensated for bearing consumption risk. The CAPM can be derived from the following special cases of the CCAPM: (1) a two-period model with quadratic utility, (2) two-periods, exponential utility, and normally-distributed returns, (3) infinite-periods, quadratic utility, and stochastic independence across time, (4) infinite periods and log utility, and (5) a first-order approximation of a general model with normal distributions. Formally, the CCAPM states that the expected risk premium on a risky asset, defined as the expected return on a risky asset less the risk free return, is proportional to the covariance of its return and consumption in the period of the return. The consumption beta is included, and the expected return is calculated as follows:Romer, David.

It is a red, furry being created by Ralph Carey in 1979. Big Red is meant to symbolize the spirit of WKU students and alumni as well as the sports teams' nickname, the \\"Hilltoppers,\\" a name chosen because the school's campus sits atop a hill 232 feet above the Barren River flowing through WKU's home city of Bowling Green. ==Creation== Prior to the start of the 1979 college basketball season, WKU student Ralph Carey volunteered to create a mascot for the school's sports teams. It was hoped a mascot would generate enthusiasm and supplement the iconic red towels waved by fans in the stands. Carey said he wanted to create something unique that stayed as far away from the hillbilly stereotype of Kentuckians as possible. Although he liked the antics of the San Diego Padres' chicken mascot and initially sketched a bear wearing a sweater emblazoned with the letter \\"W\\", he ultimately decided not to use an animal. Carey eventually presented the sketch of a red, furry blob-like mascot concept to a committee which included future university president Gary Ransdell. When asked what the character should be called, Carey suggested Big Red as an acknowledgement of the nickname given to WKU sports teams. The concept was approved. After some refinement, Carey constructed by hand the first Big Red costume - consisting of \\"air conditioner foam, fake fur, plastic tubing and aluminum framing\\" at cost of roughly $300 -. Carey then wore the suit when Big Red debuted at a home basketball game on December 1, 1979, in WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena. Carey graduated in 1980. The suit was then handed down to fellow student Mark Greer, who was the first to portray the character at a WKU football game in the fall of that year. Tryouts for students who want to portray Big Red are held in April of each year. The university library maintains an archive of every student who has portrayed the character. When a WKU student who portrayed Big Red graduates, they are allowed to wear the Big Red \\"gloves\\" on graduation day to let people know they were a WKU mascot. ==Description== According to WKU's branding guide, Big Red is neither male nor female. It must always be red and display \\"WKU\\" - the abbreviation for Western Kentucky University - on the front. The character cannot talk, but Mark Greer, the second person ever to portray Big Red, noted, \\"“It’s a very funny suit. ... It can make expressions where most mascots have one stupid expression on their face at all times. Big Red can show emotion like no other mascot.\\" The character's signature moves are the belly slide and the belly shake. The Bowling Green Daily News, the paper of record in WKU's home city, described Big Red as the \\"amorphous, ambiguous, asexual and always lovable representative of the school’s athletics\\", although in response to a Twitter message from WKU wishing Big Red a happy birthday, Ryan Nanni of SB Nation's college football blog \\"Every Day Should Be Saturday\\" speculated that having a birthday implied that Big Red was the result of - and was created by - sexual reproduction. ==Recognition== Big Red won the Universal Cheerleading Association's Key to the Spirit award in 1980, 1981 and 1983. It reached the Universal Cheerleading Association's Final Four and was awarded 2nd runner-up to collegiate Mascot of the Year in 1990. In 1996 it reached the Final Four of ESPN's \\"Battle of the Mascots.\\" In 2002, the character was part of ESPN's promotion of the SportsCenter's 25,000th. In 2007, WKU alumna Kate Mercer Miller appeared as a contestant on the game show \\"Deal or No Deal\\" and brought Big Red as one of her seven supporters who appear on the show. Big Red has also appeared as a guest on \\"The Ellen Degeneres Show\\", \\"The Tony Danza Show\\", and \\"The Early Show\\". Big Red has been selected eight times to compete in the Capital One Mascot Challenge in the competition's ten-year history, reaching the semifinals of the 2006 Capital One Mascot Challenge. That year, Big Red appeared on the game show \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" as part of the promotion of the Challenge. In 2012, Big Red was the first mascot inducted into the Capital One Mascot Challenge Hall of Fame. Big Red also ranked tenth in the inaugural Cheetos Top 25 Cheesiest College Mascots that year. In 2017, WKU's student newspaper, the College Heights Herald, reported that a crowdfunding campaign on the website SpiritFunder raised over $7,000 from 44 donors in three days to purchase a new costume for Big Red. ==Controversy== In 2003, Western Kentucky University sued Antonio Ricci and Italian television station Mediaset for $250 million, claiming that Gabibbo, a character created by Ricci and featured on Mediaset's show \\"Striscia la Notizia\\", was a \\"carbon copy\\" of Big Red and infringed on the university's intellectual property rights. Gabibbo debuted and was trademarked in Italy in 1990; although Big Red first appeared in 1979, the character was not trademarked in Italy until 1991. WKU cited a 1991 interview with Italian magazine Novella 2000 in which Ricci told the interviewer that the idea for Gabibbo came to him after seeing a photo of Big Red, noting \\"Big Red became Gabibbo.\\" When confronted by a reporter from The New York Times confronted Ricci about the quote in 2004, shortly after WKU's lawsuit was filed, he recanted, saying he was joking in the 1991 interview and had only seen Big Red after the Novella 2000 interviewer showed him a picture. Because the infringement was alleged to have occurred in Italy, the dispute was adjudicated in the Italian court system. WKU won each round of the case in lower Italian courts, but in 2008, the Court of Lugo ruled in favor of Mediaset. The ruling held that Big Red's function as a mascot was entitled to copyright protection, but that the likeness of Big Red was in the public domain and ineligible for copyright protection. It further noted differences in the appearance and behavior of the characters, including Gabibbo's trademark tuxedo (in contrast to Big Red's apparel bearing the \\"WKU\\" abbreviation) and Gabibbo's ability to speak. On appeal, the court of appeals in Milan ruled in favor of Ricci and Mediaset. In 2018, WKU and Big Red's creator, Ralph Carey, re-filed the lawsuit, and the Italian Supreme Court ruled that the case had merit, sending it back to the Milan Court of Appeals. ==External links== *Big Red's official Facebook page ==References== Category:Conference USA mascots Category:Western Kentucky University Category:Mascots introduced in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in Kentucky ","title":"Big Red (Western Kentucky University)"},{"id":"7772754","text":"Kruševo is a town in North Macedonia.

He, along with his contemporaries Palghat Mani Iyer and Ramanathapuram C. S. Murugabhoopathy, are revered as the \\"Holy Trinity of Mridanga\\". He was adept in playing the mridangam and kanjira. He was the sishya (disciple) of the celebrated Palani Muthaiah Pillai (his father). ==Early life== Subramaniam Pillai was born on 20 April 1908. He was born to his mother, Unnamulai Ammal, and his father, Muthaiah Pillai who was also a mridangist. He learned mridangam under the tutelage of his father and also had the friendship of ‘Thavil Panchami’ Malikkottai Panchapakesa Pillai. He was also influenced by a renowned mridangist at the time, Dakshinamurthy Pillai. Pillai in return showered great love and affection on young Palani, whom he looked upon as his own son. Before he turned twenty, Palani had the good fortune to accompany stalwarts like Kanchipuram Nayana Pillai, Mazhavarayanendal Subbarama Bhavathar and Mudicondon Venkatarama Iyer. In the next decade others who preferred his accompaniment were Chittoor Subramanya Pillai and importantly Alathur Brothers whose Guru (father of Alathur Subbier), Alathur Venkatesa Iyer was a great admirer of Palani. It was because of Palani that the brothers shifted base from Trichy to Madras and they made a great team. Palani is credited with composing a larger number of major pallavis for the brothers including their tempo and nadai variations. Later the team broke up (due to personal misunderstandings) much to the grief of a large number of listeners and especially Venkatesa Iyer. Iyer managed to effect a reconciliation after a decade of extensive effort and Palani did team up with the brothers but the old camaraderie was gone. ==Career== As Palani's playing in the early part of his career was robust and laya-oriented with extensive calculations, many vocalists of the time did not feel comfortable with him except for the few mentioned earlier. It was one of the most popular among the dozens of yesteryears, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar (earlier responsible in advancing the careers of Mysore T.Chowdiah and Palghat Mani Iyer) who took to promoting Palani. There were numerous concerts in which he gave Palani opportunities to play three of four \\"Thanis\\" or solos in a concert. It is said that in a concert in Shanmukhananda Sabha in Bombay he asked Palani to play in each of the five nadais, Chatusram, Tisram, Misram, Kandam and Sankeernam. It was he who also persuaded Palani to tone down on the laya intricacies and increased the \\"sowkya\\" or aesthetic content in his playing. Palani, probably with considerable regret in having to shed his specialization and scholarship abided by his mentor's suggestion, not only because of the practicality but also because of his great respect for Chembai who was his elder by several years. Bhavagathar's advice stood Palani in good stead. Eminently popular vidwans G. N. Balasubramaniam, Madurai Mani Iyer, and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer clamored to have him accompany him in their concerts. Of course senior vidwans of that era like Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer, Chembai and Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu ( Violin Solo ) had him as accompanist in many concerts. In turn Palani encouraged a number of younger vocal and instrumental artists including Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna, Ramnad Krishnan, M. D. Ramanathan, K. V. Narayanaswamy, Tiruvarur Namasivayam, Thanjavur Thyagarajan, Lalgudi Jayaraman and Palghat R. Raghu. While playing for younger artists he was never condescending but was always supportive and never tried to show off or intimidate. In fact although he possessed talents of gigantic proportions, he never indulged in exhibitionism and his only aim was to enhance the total appeal of the concert. Madurai Mani Iyer used to call him \\"THYAGI\\"- one who would efface himself so that the overall effect was sparkling rather focus on himself. While Palani would highlight the different parts of the song such as \\"Eduppus\\" of Pallavi, Anupallavi, and Charanam with sufficient emphasis, he would rather follow the mood and trend of the song rather play the \\"Prayogas\\" of the songs themselves. This mode of playing gave a wholesomeness to the song renderings rather than the \\"Starts and stops\\" that would otherwise have arisen. His Sarvalaghu was the spontaneous flow of \\"Nadais\\", \\"Sollus\\", and \\"Sollukkatus\\" rather than any patternised formats. The Sarvalaghu used to be \\"Amorphous\\" rather than \\"Crystalline\\". Occasionally when certain arithmetic combinations arose, they too were spontaneous and blended seamlessly into the scheme of things. He specialized in \\"Vallinam\\" and \\"Mellinam\\" strokes in even the smallest passages. In layman's language these are Hard and Soft Strokes. His playing gave the effect of his indulging in a musical conversation with the main artist throughout the tenure of the concert. In his Solo interludes-\\"Thani Avarthanams\\"- he displayed both intellectual and aesthetic aspects in equal measure which pleased all sections of the audience but he never played to the gallery. The vocalist had to remain very alert during the \\"Thanis\\" to ensure that he did not miss out on the \\"Thala\\"; such were the complex patterns he played! When Palani was present in a gathering there was no levity or frivolousness exhibited. According to Vidwans who shared the platform with him in concerts both his demeanor and playing was the epitome of \\"Gauravam\\" (Dignity). His lifestyle in the 1940s and 1950s was the envy of other musicians. Always dressed in white muslin shirts and snow white Khadi Dhoti - carefully and painstakingly groomed - he was among the handsomest among musicians (others being GNB and Mayavaram V. R. Govindaraja Pillai). Unlike many other musicians, he lived in a spacious bungalow and owned the latest model in cars (he changed them every two years). He himself drove the car and did not allow anyone else to drive his car. Palani's partner in life was Rajammal (who along with her sister constituted a popular singing duo called 'Kolar Sisters' in her younger days). The pair had a daughter named Vimala. She married Srinivasan and they had five daughters named Banu, Malathi, Meera, Geetha and Vasanthi. They were brought up by Rajammal after the death of Srinivasan. At any given time at least three to four students resided in Palani's house undergoing Gurukula system; with passage of time there were day-scholars also. Among the earliest disciple of Palani were T. Ranganathan (brother of T. Balasaraswathi) along with Ramanathapuram M.N.Kandaswami, Poovalur Venkataraman, Dandamudi Rammohan Rao, Pallathur C.T.Lakshmanan, Udumalai T.Mayilswamy, T.S Janakiraman among others. The most famous of his disciples is Trichy Sankaran who lives in Toronto, Canada. He retired as a Professor in the Music Department of York University. Palani took him under his wings when he was a child; Even at the tender of twelve Palani enabled him to play with him (double mridangam) in concerts of Ariyakudi, GNB, Madurai Mani Iyer and others. Among his later disciples were Erode Gururajan, Madirimangalam Swaminathan, K.S.Kalidas, Cuddapah Krishnamoorthy, A.V.Ragguprasad, T.V.Gurumoorthy and many others. In turn, his disciples have trained many others and the Palani School is now well represented in India and abroad. The founder of the 'Pudukkottai School of Percussion', Mamundia Pillai introduced Kanjira as an instrument in concerts; His disciples Dakshinamoorthy Pillai and Muthiah Pillai could play a large number of instruments like Mridangam, Kanjira, Thavil, and Ghatam. In their steps, Palani was also a GREAT Kanjira vidwan besides being a master of Mridangam. He has played with vidwans like Palghat Mani Iyer and Ramanathapuram C. S. Murugabhoopathy. His Khanjira performances were fewer (compared to Mridangam) and listeners thronged to these concerts whenever they occurred. Compared to the double headed Mridangam with its rich tonal quality, the single headed Kanjira with its limited tonal quality is more difficult to handle but Palani equaled or even excelled in duets with the best mridangists. Some of Palani's disciples have emerged as vidwans proficient with both instruments ( among them M.N.Kandaswamy and Palattur Lakshmanan). At the behest of his father Palani erected a shrine on the Samathi of Mamundia Pillai at Pudukkottai in 1945. Till he died in 1962, Palani performed Gurupooja each year at this Samadhi on Mamundia Pillai's death anniversary. This is the day preceding the Aradhana of Saint Thyagaraja (which falls on Bagulapanchami day). After Palani's death his disciples took this over and also initiated the Gurupooja for Palani across different places in Tamil Nadu(M.N.Kandaswamy in Chennai, Udumalai T.Mayilswamy in Coimbatore, etc.). In Kerala Palani ‘s disciples are KNS Namboodri, Karunakaran Pillai, and Thankappan.

Former names of Chaucer include Chaucer Technology School, Geoffrey Chaucer Technology School and Canterbury Technical High School for Boys In February 2014 Kent County Council announced that the school would shut because of low pupil intake and poor standards. Just weeks before Swale Academies Trust had promised a conversion to academy status and the sale of land to rebuild the school, but these plans were scrapped. Shortly after the proposal for closure was made public a petition on Change.org was created in an attempt to revert Kent County Council's decision, but this failed. The school closed in September 2015. ==History== The school was founded before the Second World War as the Canterbury Technical High School for Boys. It shared the old hospital building on Longport Street with a girls' equivalent (which became Barton Court Grammar School) and the Technical College (now Canterbury College). In September 1967 the boys' school moved to the current site on Spring Lane. When in the later 1980's the school became one of the first to be translated into a technology school with the encouragement the Conservative government, it was launched under the headship of Noreen Manning, previously head of Camden School for Girls in London who subsequently retired from the Chaucer through ill health. Around the same time as the implementation of a college system in 2008, the school uniform was updated following a school-wide consultation, the senior management of the school was restructured and a rebranding of the school's image was completed. The school was then often referred to as \\"Chaucer Tech\\". In Spring 2009 Chaucer was used in a BBC Inside Out South East television news feature to highlight the issue of asbestos in local school buildings. it was detected in two small cupboards that were used to store asbestos before it was linked with lung disorders. The school was used as the case study example of one of the 90 per cent of local schools that had asbestos. The school was found to have asbestos (like 554 out of 599 schools in KentBBC Inside Out South East article) but was shown to have dealt with the problem. Pupils from the school were chosen to be members of a \\"guard of honour\\" for athletes at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games, displaying artistic creations that the school had made to celebrate the event. Up to the early years of the second decade of the 21st century the school was well regarded and received satisfactory reports following inspections, but later the school was reported to be unsatisfactory and was closed by the Council in 2015. ==Campus== Chaucer had a 12-classroom teaching block. These previously housed a large majority of English and maths lessons, but later changed to cover humanities subjects such as geography and history as a result of the College System. The block was often referred to as the \\"Humanities Block\\", \\"H Block\\" or \\"W Block\\", the W being a reference to Graham Wade, the school's fifth head teacher, who died of cancer. The school completed a new Sixth Form Building in October 2008. Named the Fuller Block, after a former Chair of the Governing Body who died, it housed a common room, an assembly room, staff offices and multiple teaching rooms primarily for use by the Post 16 (or Sixth Form) of the school. ==Organisation and administration== In 2008 Chaucer introduced a new \\"Colleges of Learning\\" system in which every student, aside from \\"Post 16/Sixth Form\\" students, was assigned to a specific subject group. The five colleges were named Da Vinci, Curie, Marlowe, Assisi and Athena, and were made up of different subject areas. For example, Da Vinci College included mathematics and design technology. Subject groups changed classrooms to reflect this shift and so generally the colleges were geographically situated around the school site. The college system ceased to be used from the beginning of the 2013/14 academic year. Chaucer Technology School was one of the many schools in Kent that used SIMS (School Information Management System), a Management Information System (MIS) developed by Capita's Education Services. The school also agreed with Capita to provide a case study, in which the former head teacher Simon Murphy said: “It is fundamental for students to understand where they are and what strategies they need to reach their potential and for parents to also understand, so they can support their children. Using the tools within SIMS we are able to support this.” ===Examinations=== League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A-levels ranked Chaucer as the 56th best school in Kent. According to the BBC, in 2008 A-Level students achieved an average of 620.4 QCDA points, against a national average of 739.8 and 31% of students achieved five or more grade C results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English. ==References== ==External links== * *Schoolsnet.com - review of school Category:Schools in Canterbury Category:Defunct schools in Kent Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2015 Category:2015 disestablishments in England ","title":"Chaucer School, Canterbury"},{"id":"7772807","text":"Double jeopardy is an empirical law in marketing where, with few exceptions, the lower-market-share brands in a market have both far fewer buyers in a time period and also lower brand loyalty.

Robustness in Representing Product Purchases, Brand Purchases and Imperfectly Recorded Purchases,\\" Marketing Science, 4 (3), 255–266 == Marketing strategy implications == The main implication of double jeopardy is that market share growth depends substantially on growing the size of a brand's customer base.Sharp, Byron (2010). How Brands Grow. South Melbourne: Oxford University Press. So brand managers of a smaller market share brand should not be reprimanded for lower customer loyalty metrics. Also, they should not be expected to build customer loyalty to the brand without substantially increasing the brand's market penetration.Ehrenberg and Goodhardt, Marketing Research, Spring issue. 2002. == Exceptions to double jeopardy == There are two potential deviations from double jeopardy, (1) a brand with unusually low penetration and consequently higher loyalty constituting its market share (known as a niche brand), and (2) unusually high penetration and low repeat- purchase rates (known as a change-of-pace brand).Kahn, Barbara E., Manohar U. Kalwani, and Donald G. Morrison (1988), \\"Niching Versus Change-of-Pace Brands: Using Purchase Frequencies and Penetration Rates to Infer Brand Positionings,\\" Journal of Marketing Research, 25 (November), 384–90. Known examples include: * Retailer brands (private label) – niched because of their restricted distribution these brands' market share is constituted of low penetration and consequently unusually high repeat buying. * Hispanic TV networks in the USA – niched because most US viewers do not speak Spanish these networks have few viewers but these fewer (Spanish speaking) viewers watch for an unusually high number of hours compared to viewers of similarly rating networks. * Seasonal brands (e.g. chocolate Easter eggs) – for their respective market shares these brands have an unusually high penetration and low repeat-purchase rates (i.e. they are change-of-pace brands). These may also be seen as different examples of brands with restricted distribution; each individual retailer brand is only available in one store chain, Hispanic TV channels will only be selected by Spanish speakers (a form of restricted distribution), Easter egg distribution is restricted by time – everywhere but not for very long. ==References== Category:Brand management pt:Double jeopardy ","title":"Double jeopardy (marketing)"},{"id":"7772809","text":"Archbishop's School is a mixed-ability Church of England secondary school on a parkland site on the outskirts of Canterbury, Kent in the United Kingdom.

However, to dispel rumours that they were solely for the use of the middle classes, they were renamed in 1887 to become the Simon Langton Girls' and Boys' schools, named after Simon Langton, an Archdeacon of Canterbury who in 1248 had left behind legacies to the Poor Priest's Hospital. During the Baedecker Blitz in the Second World War, the old school buildings were destroyed - they were situated in what is now the Whitefriar's Shopping Centre and rebuilt on its present site (just off the A2050) in 1950. In 2005, Simon Langton Girls' became a specialist school in music and information and communication technology (ICT). In 2008, the national Gold ArtsMark was awarded to the school for the third time in 2008, for excellence in Art, Music, Drama, Dance and Textiles. ArtsMark is the benchmark for arts education provision and Simon Langton Girls' received the Gold award in 2002, 2005 and 2008. Jane Robinson became the head teacher in January 2008. In 2010, the school gained the International School Award. ==Site== The school‘s main classroom block is a 1940s building, originally planned to become a military reserve hospital, which contains thirteen science laboratories, classrooms, studios for art, music and drama, Design Technology workshops and a refurbished Sixth Form centre with a library, computer suite and Common Room. The site is characterised by its green spaces, bordered with steep grassy hills and large trees, which pollinate over the summer. The school site also has a large sports field, as well as a netball/tennis court and an Orchard, run by the Biology Dept. in conjunction with the WellWorld Project, which aims to promote biodiversity in schools. Recently, a £20m project has begun to build a new classroom block and Sports Hall on site, to replace the original 1940s building, which is set to open in September 2020. ==Academic performance and Ofsted reports== A 2009 Ofsted inspection found that the overall effectiveness of the mathematics subject to be outstanding, stating that \\"Many students experience outstanding teaching\\" from \\"some exceptionally talented teachers\\" and \\"some excellent use is made of computer- linked whiteboards to enhance students’ understanding.\\" \\"Achievement post-16 is good. Standards are very high.\\" Ofsted lead inspector, Ian Stuart, wrote a letter to pupils on 7 June 2007 to tell them they were \\"developing into fine young people\\" who were \\"outstanding ambassadors\\" for their generation following the 2007 Ofsted inspection which rated the school as \\"outstanding\\" in all areas. ==Academy proposals== In 2016 the governing body of Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School began consulting on the possibility of the school converting to academy status.

He is the grandson and tribal successor of Nawab Akbar Bugti, former chief minister and governor of the Balochistan province. He campaigns for the rights of Baloch people around Europe. He is currently living in self exile in Switzerland. He met the then Chief Minister of Balochistan, Dr. Malik Baloch, and federal minister, Gen (r) Abdul Qadir Baloch, in Geneva, twice in 2015. Bugti condones negotiations with Pakistan and a political resolution of the political differences in Balochistan. In 2017, his asylum request was rejected by Swiss authorities. The Swiss authorities said that the Bugti's asylum request was rejected because he was involved in terror-related activities. His brother-in-law, Mehran Marri was also banned from entering Switzerland. The Swiss authorities stated that both Brahumdagh Bugti and Mehran Marri are a security risk to Switzerland. ==Abduction of UN official== UN Resident Representative, Fikret Akcura, stated that Brahumdagh Bugti had connections with the abduction of UN official John Solecki in 2009. Similarly, United Nations Special Representative to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, called the then President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai regarding the release of Solecki. President Karzai admitted that Brahumdagh Bugti was in Kabul and that he will pressure Brahumdagh Bugti for the safe release of John Solecki. ==Allegations of terrorism and self-exile== Bugti went into self-exile in Afghanistan during a military operation Dera Bugti 2006 against the Baloch militants. Pakistan has alleged that he has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks. In 2007, Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf said that Bugti had been planning terrorist attacks from Afghanistan with covert Indian and Afghan support. Afghan president Hamid Karzai publicly rejected this accusation, but later secretly admitted to US officials that Bugti was provided safe-haven in Kabul. In 2010 when Pakistan asked Kabul to hand him over, Bugti moved to Switzerland. In 2016, it was reported that Brahamdagh Bugti had applied for Asylum in India but it was put on hold by the government of India. However, a report back in 2010 stated he already held an Indian passport. In 2017, Bugti's asylum request was rejected by the Swiss government on the basis of Bugti's links with “incidents of terrorism, violence and militant activities\\". Bugti moved to Switzerland in October 2010 and since then he is living in Geneva along with his family. In September 2016, Pakistan contacted Interpol to extradite Bugti but the request was dismissed by Interpol in December 2017. Bugti accuses Pakistan of serious human rights violations and blames Pakistani media for not highlighting the frightful situation in Balochistan including military operations, enforced disappearances, torture, and killing of Baloch civilians and political activists. In an Interview with the Republic, he called Pakistan a terrorist state and the Pakistani army a terrorist supporting army. ==References== Category:Baloch militants Category:Baloch nationalists Brahamdagh Category:Living people Category:Pakistani exiles Category:Pakistani expatriates in Afghanistan Category:Pakistani expatriates in Switzerland Category:People from Dera Bugti District Category:Tumandars Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Brahumdagh Bugti"},{"id":"7772845","text":"Big Bus Tours(formerly Les Cars Rouges and The Big Bus Company), is the largest operator of open top bus sightseeing tours founded in May 2011 after \\"Les Cars Rouges\\" and the \\"Big Bus Company\\" merged.

It replaced the putting out system, where contractors worked in their own facilities. Inside contracting was the system favored by the Springfield and Harper's Ferry Armories. Since the manufacturing system developed in the armories also became popular (the American system of manufacturing), manufacturers in the early 19th century tended to hire people trained in the armories as managers. They brought with them the practice of inside contracting. The manufacturer hired inside contractors and provided materials and machinery. Each inside contractor was expected to hire his own employees and meet certain production and quality goals, but everything else was left to him. As a result, the system rewarded ingenuity, but also rewarded local optimization. For example, it was to the inside contractor's benefit to allow machinery to deteriorate toward the end of his contract since maintenance was costly and he might not reap the long-term benefit if he didn't get another contract. The system was eventually replaced with the factory system, in which everyone was an employee of the manufacturer directly. ==See also== *Independent contractor ==References== Category:Modern economic history Category:Business economics ","title":"Inside contracting"},{"id":"7772919","text":"Guruvayur Dorai (left) accompanying Ravikiran (center) playing the navachitravina, a variant of the chitravina. Also shown are Ravi Balasubramanian, ghatam and Akkarai S. Subhalakshmi, violin. Guruvayur Dorai (born 2 July 1935) is an Indian percussionist. He is one of the most senior exponents of the South Indian classical percussion instrument, the mridangam. He had his initial training under Palghat Subba Iyer and E.P. Narayana Pisharody, and later from the legendary master Palani Subramaniam Pillai. Initiating his concert performances at the age of eight, Guruvayur Dorai has performed on the concert platform for the past 60 years. His wide range of efforts in the field of mridangam and music have helped propagate the art around the globe. == Early years == An exponent of the Pudukottai style of mridangam, Guruvayur Dorai (his real name being Vaidynathan) was born in the temple town Guruvayur, Kerala, to G.S. Krishna Iyer and Meenakshi. His father was a priest and mother, a housewife. He has two brothers and three sisters. His sister Guruvayur Ponnammal was a highly reputed singer at the time. His other sister is a reputed music teacher in Madras, while his brother, G.K.Rajamani is a notable violinist living in Palghat (Kerala). Young Dorai had a penchant for percussion and was frequently seen drumming on his body with his fingers even while in sleep. Struck by polio at the age of five, his father thought it would be difficult for Dorai to go outside of Guruvayur for higher studies and a job. There was already a vocalist and a violinist in the family, a mridangist was all that was lacking. So his father decided to sculpt him into one. His father thought Ponnammal, Rajamani and Dorai could give concerts together and that the siblings would take care of Dorai. Moreover, they could make a living out of it. Dorai began to learn mridangam under the Late Palghat Subba Iyer when he was six. E.P. Narayana Pisharody of Eranallur also taught him at this time. Pisharody's book 'Mridanga Nada Manjari' (a practical study of mridangam) was published by Guruvayur Dorai on 23 September 2001. The legendary vocalist Chembai Vaidhyanatha Bhagavathar was teaching Ponnammal at that time. Whenever he came to Guruvayur, Chembai used to stay at their house. He took active interest in Dorai's mridangam practice. Dorai had his debut performance (arangetram) at the age of eight, performing with none other than Chembai himself. 1949 was a watershed in Dorai's career, as he came to Chennai for the first time to perform with Chembai in a concert. Meanwhile, Ponnammal got a chance to sing in a Malayalam film. As the opportunities were more copious in Chennai, their father decided to settle there. Dorai, Ponnammal, Rajamani and the father stayed in a rented house in the city while the rest of the family remained in Guruvayur. In the same year, he also happened to meet the legendary mridangam artist Palani Subramaniam Pillai in Thirupoontharai. After Palani Subramaniam Pillai moved to Madras in 1953, Dorai commenced classes with the maestro. This helped him understand and absorb the complexities of the Pudukottai style of mridangam. Dorai stayed with Palani Subramaniam Pillai in his residence for nearly nine years in the gurukulavasam fashion. == Performances == Dorai performed with nearly all the eminent artists even at a young age, including Musiri Subramania Iyer, M. D. Ramanathan, Semmangudi Srinivasa lyer, M. S. Subbulakshmi (it was Dorai who performed with her in Carnegie Hall, New York), G. N. Balasubramaniam, Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu, S. Balachander, Chitti Babu, T. R. Mahalingam, Mysore T. Chowdiah, Palghat Ghatam Sundaram, Alangudi Ramachandran, G. Harishankar and others. Dorai also accompanied Sr. Vinjamuri Varadaraja Iyengar on multiple occasion to concerts across Andhrapadesh. An excerpt from his interview - \\"He encouraged me very much, kept me with him and let me play for him. Apart from that, I gave a lot of kutcheries in Andhra Pradesh. For all those places, Vinjamuri Varadaraja Iyengar took me with him; like Kakinada, Guntur, Tenali, Vijayawada and to many other places he took me with him and introduced me. Because of his taking me with him, those Sabhas/ people got acquainted with me and got to know me\\". Read More About the Interview Moreover, he is one of the few mridangists who has performed with nagaswaram wizards, namely T. N. Rajarathnam Pillai (in 1956, Rama Seva Mandali, Bangalore; P. Bhuvaneswariah played violin, Bangalore Venkatram played ghatam, and a khanjira artist was part of the team), Thiruvengadu Subramanium Pillai in 1951, and Namagiripettai Krishnan (from the 1960s onwards). He has also performed with leading present- day artists including K.J. Yesudas, T. N. Krishnan, T. V. Sankaranarayanan, T. N. Seshagopalan, Neyveli Santhanagopalan, Chitraveena N.

Charles was the oldest of five, with two brothers, George and Fred, and two sisters, Florence and Mildred. Makley dropped out of school in the eighth grade and turned to crime in his teens, first with petty theft, then bootlegging and bank robbery in at least three Midwestern states.Newton, M. (2002). The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. Checkmark Books, an imprint of Facts on File, Inc. . pp. 183-184. Makley's father worked as a stone cutter and in the 1910 Ohio census a 20-year-old Charles is listed as working in his father’s profession. His parents had divorced by this time. On his prison paperwork, Charles often listed his occupation as salesman. He also listed his wife as Edith Slife Makley, a woman married to his brother Fred. ==Early criminal career== Makley did not begin a criminal career in earnest until his early thirties. On November 21, 1921, he was arrested for receiving stolen property in Detroit, Michigan. He was found not guilty. Over the next three years, Makley was arrested various times in Missouri. On July 30, 1924, he was arrested in Wichita, Kansas, for bank robbery, under the alias of Charles McGray. He was sentenced to 15 years, but was paroled in May 1928. A few days later, he robbed a bank in Hammond, Indiana. He was apprehended on June 2, 1928, and sentenced to 10 to 20 years. Makley entered Indiana State Prison in Michigan City on June 25, 1928. ==Meeting John Dillinger== At the time of Makley’s incarceration, Indiana State Prison was on the silent system. Prisoners remained silent during work hours and in the dining hall. Makley was not a model prisoner, but incurred only minor infractions during his stay at Indiana State: possessing contraband cigarette papers, having an electric stove, and wearing first grade uniform to a ball game. It was here that Makley became friends with a number of prominent bank robbers, including Harry Pierpont, Homer Van Meter, John Hamilton, Russell Clark, and John Dillinger. Dillinger was paroled in May 1933, but swore to liberate his friends, and had pistols smuggled in to Makley, Pierpont, Hamilton, Clark, and several other convicts. The pistols were smuggled in a crate of thread that was delivered to the prison shirt shop. On September 26, 1933, a total of ten armed men escaped from the main gate of Indiana State Prison. The ten escapees were Harry Pierpont, Russell Clark, Charles Makley, John Hamilton, James Jenkins, Ed Shouse, Walter Dietrich, James Clark, Joseph Fox and Joseph Burns. ==Crime spree== The ten escapees immediately split into two groups. Dietrich, Fox, Burns and James Clark commandeered a car at gunpoint from a sheriff that was taking a prisoner to Michigan city and split from the others. Makley remained with the group headed by Harry Pierpont. They went to the home of Pierpont's girlfriend, Mary Kinder, to change out of their prison uniforms, and then hid out at a farm owned by Pierpont's parents near Leipsic, Ohio. It was around this time that the gang learned that Dillinger had himself recently been arrested for bank robbery and was being detained at the Allen County jail in Lima, Ohio. Determined to free Dillinger, the gang needed cash to fund an escape. On October 3, 1933, the gang robbed the First National Bank of St. Mary's, Ohio.The Sarber/Dillinger Story . The Allen County Museum. Retrieved November 27, 2006. Nine days later, on October 12, gang members converged on the jail where Dillinger was being held. Pierpont, Makley, and Russell Clark entered the facility, while Ed Shouse remained outside as a lookout. The three men confronted Sheriff Jesse Sarber—in the presence of Deputy Wilbur Sharp and Sarber's wife—and stated that they were from Indiana State Prison with a transfer request for John Dillinger. When the sheriff asked to see their credentials, Pierpont shot him in the abdomen. Makley and one other man then physically assaulted the sheriff, mortally injuring him. They locked the deputy and Sarber's wife in a cell and left Sarber for dead while they made their escape. On October 14, Dillinger, Makley, and the gang stole guns, ammunition and bulletproof vests from a police station in Auburn, Indiana. On October 20, they pulled a similar heist at a police station in Peru, Indiana. On October 23, the gang used its new arsenal to rob a bank in Greencastle, Indiana, escaping with $74,782. By the end of the year, Makley ranked fourth on Illinois' list of \\"public enemies\\", behind Dillinger, Pierpont, and Hamilton. ==Capture and trial for murder== On January 25, 1934, while the gang was lying low in Tucson, Arizona, a fire broke out in a leaky furnace at the Hotel Congress, where Makley and Clark were staying. They were rescued by the fire department, and bribed a fireman, William Benedict, to retrieve their suitcases, which contained their guns. Days after the fire, Benedict identified Makley from his mugshot in a True Detective magazine. Makley was apprehended at the Crabtree Electric Company, shopping for a radio, using the alias \\"J.C. Davies\\". The rest of the gang was apprehended shortly afterwards. Dillinger was extradited to Crown Point, Indiana to stand trial for the murder of Officer William O'Malley during the gang's robbery of the First National Bank in East Chicago on January 15, while Pierpont, Makley and Clark were sent back to Indiana State Prison under the supervision of Sheriff Don Sarber, the son of the Allen County sheriff they had killed. All three were later extradited to Lima, Ohio, to stand trial for Sheriff Sarber's murder. Testimony from Ed Shouse saw Makley, Clark and Pierpont convicted in three consecutive trials over the course of two weeks in March 1934, while Dillinger, who had escaped Crown Point and joined up with Baby Face Nelson, robbed banks in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Mason City, Iowa. On March 24, 1934, Makley and Pierpont received death sentences, while Clark received a life sentence. On March 27, the three were transferred to the Ohio State Prison in Columbus. ==Final escape attempt== While waiting for their turn in the electric chair, Makley and Pierpont carved a pair of revolvers from large bars of soap, and blackened them with shoe polish. On September 22, 1934, the two used these props to attempt an escape. They assaulted a guard and freed Clark from his cell nearby. Before they had gone far, Clark, who was not looking at an imminent death sentence, lost his nerve and retreated to his cell. Moments later, armed guards arrived and shot Makley and Pierpont. Makley, hit in the thorax and abdomen, died on the scene. Pierpont was seriously wounded, but survived and was later executed. Makley's death certificate states that internal hemorrhaging from these wounds caused his death. He is buried in the Sugar Ridge Cemetery in Leipsic, Ohio. ==Temperament== While a habitual criminal, Makley cultivated the appearance and demeanor of a prosperous legitimate businessman. In between crimes he worked as a salesman and insurance agent, and could easily pass for a respectable citizen. A story often told of Makley is that some time in the mid-1920s after robbing a bank he went straight to a civic luncheon at which he was giving the keynote speech. The story itself is most likely apocryphal, but its popularity gives an insight into the man's charisma. ==Other media== In the 2009 film Public Enemies, Makley is played by Christian Stolte ==See also== ^List of fugitives from justice who disappeared ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Other sources=== * 1910 United States Census Ohio * Prison Record for Charles Makley Indiana State Prison Michigan City Category:1889 births Category:1934 deaths Category:American bank robbers Category:American people convicted of murdering police officers Category:American people who died in prison custody Category:American prisoners sentenced to death Category:Lima, Ohio Category:Depression-era gangsters Category:Deaths by firearm in Ohio Category:Prisoners who died in Ohio detention Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Ohio Category:People convicted of murder by Ohio Category:People from St. Mary's, Ohio ","title":"Charles Makley"},{"id":"7773040","text":"Bhadragiri Achyuta Das performing Harikathe in Kannada. Harikatha (Kannada: ಹರಿಕಥೆ : Harikathe; Telugu: హరికథ : Harikatha; Marathi: हरीपाठ : Haripatha) , literally \\" Story of Lord Hari\\", also known as Harikatha Kaalakshepam in Telugu and Tamil (Spending time to listen to Hari's story (Katha)), is a form of Hindu traditional discourse in which the storyteller explores a traditional theme, usually the life of a saint or a story from an Indian epic. The person telling the story through songs, music and narration is called a Haridasa. Harikatha is a composite art form composed of storytelling, poetry, music, drama, dance, and philosophy most prevalent in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Any Hindu religious theme may be the subject for the Harikatha. At its peak Harikatha was a popular medium of entertainment, which helped transmit cultural, educational and religious values to the masses. The main aim of Hari Katha is to imbue truth and righteousness in the minds of people and sow the seeds of devotion in them. Another of the aims is to educate them about knowledge of self (atman) through stories and show them the path of liberation. ==In Hindu mythology== In Hindu mythology, the first Harikatha singer was sage Narada who sang for Vishnu, other prominent singers were Lava and Kusha twin sons of Rama, who sang the Ramayana in his court at Ayodhya.Singh, p. 2118 ==History== This is an ancient form that took current form during the Bhakti movement in around 12th century. Many famous Haridasa are Purandaradasa, Kanakadasa. Telugu form of Harikatha originated in Coastal Andhra during the 19th century. Harikatha Kalakshepam is most prevalent in Andhra even now along with Burra katha. Haridasus going round villages singing devotional songs is an age-old tradition during Dhanurmaasam preceding Sankranti festival. Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Dasu was the originator of the Telugu Harikatha tradition, and with his Kavyas and Prabandhas has made it a special art form. ==Style== Harikatha involves the narration of a story, intermingled with various songs relating to the story. Usually, the narration involves numerous sub-plots and anecdotes, which are used to emphasize various aspects of the main story. The main storyteller is usually assisted by one or more co-signers, who elaborate the songs and a Mridangam accompanist. The storyteller uses a pair of cymbals to keep the beat. ==Famous exponents== Following Krishna Bhagavatar, other great exponents of this art form such as Pandit Lakshmanachar, Tirupazhanam Panchapakesa Bhagavatar, Mangudi Chidambara Bhagavatar, Muthiah Bhagavatar, Tiruvaiyyar Annasami Bhagavatar, Embar Srirangachariyar, Konnoor Sitarama Shastry, Sulamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, Sulamangalam Soundararaja Bhagavatar, Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Dasu, Embar Vijayaraghavachariar, Saraswati Bai and Padmasini Bai popularized the Harikatha tradition. Saraswati Bai was a pioneering woman Harikatha exponent. She broke the monopoly of Brahmin men over this art form. This was attested by F. G. Natesa Iyer (in 1939) who said: \\"Saraswati Bai is a pioneer, and today, as a result of her sacrifices. Brahmins and non-Brahmins walk freely over the once forbidden ground. C. Saraswati Bai has achieved this miracle.\\" Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri started out as a Harikatha exponent and then changed to Pravachan style. Recent practitioners of Harikatha include Veeragandham Venkata Subbarao, Kota Sachchidananda Sastri, Mannargudi Sambasiva Bhagavatar, Banni Bai, Mysore Sreekantha Shastry, Kamala Murthy, Embar Vijayaraghavachariar, Kalyanapuram Aravamudachariar,Smt Vishaka hari, Gururajulu Naidu, and T S Balakrishna Sastry. One of the best harikatha renderings is on the life of saint Tyagaraja by Sri Mullukutla Sadasiva Sastry from Tenali. ==See also== * Burra katha * Carnatic music * Katha - The Art Of Story Telling In India * Kirtan * Oggu Katha * Pravachan ==Notes== ==References== * * * Harikatha: its origins and development, by Kalaimamani B.

It is present from around the 12th week of gestation, and commences as a peritoneal outpouching. ==Sex differences== In males, it precedes the testes in their descent down within the gubernaculum, and closes. This closure (also called fusion) occurs at any point from a few weeks before birth, to a few weeks after birth. The remaining portion around the testes becomes the tunica vaginalis. If it does not close in females, it forms the canal of Nuck. ==Clinical significance== Failure of closure of the vaginal process leads to the propensity to develop a number of abnormalities. Peritoneal fluid can travel down a patent vaginal process leading to the formation of a hydrocele. Persistent patent processus vaginalis is more common on the right than the left. Accumulation of blood in a persistent processus vaginalis could result in a hematocele. There is the potential for an indirect inguinal hernia to develop, although not all people with a patent vaginal process will develop one. The more patent the vaginal process, the more likely the patient is to develop a hernia. Congenital malformation of the vaginal process is also the leading cause of testicular torsion, since lack of attachment to the inner lining of the scrotum leaves the testicles free to twist. ==See also== * Canal of Nuck * List of homologues of the human reproductive system ==References== ==External links== * Category:Embryology of urogenital system ","title":"Vaginal process"},{"id":"7773093","text":"The Perseus molecular cloud (Per MCld) is a nearby (~1000 ly) giant molecular cloud in the constellation of Perseus and contains over 10,000 solar masses of gas and dust covering an area of 6 by 2 degrees.

He was educated at Hawtreys, a boarding preparatory school then in Kent, Westminster School and Eton — where his classmates included Harold Acton, Eric Blair, Brian Howard, and Robert Byron— and at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College. == Painting, stage design == After completing his studies, he became a portrait painter and commissions for theatre work soon followed, beginning with his designing the masks for a London production of Serge Diaghilev's ballet Zephyr et Flore (1925). Subsequently, he created masks, costumes, and sets – many of which have been preserved by the Theatre Museum, London – for various works staged by C. B. Cochran's revues through the late 1920s and early 1930s. His work as a set designer was also featured in the US in such Broadway shows as The Country Wife (1936); The Lady's Not For Burning (1950); Romeo and Juliet (1951); House of Flowers (1954), for which he won the Tony Award; and Rashomon (1959), which was nominated for a Tony Award for his costume as well as his set design. He also designed the costumes for Romeo and Juliet; Rashomon; and Gigi (1973), the latter two receiving Tony Award nominations. For film his costume designs include The Private Life of Don Juan (1934); Scarlet Pimpernel (1934); Romeo and Juliet (1936); The Thief of Bagdad (1940); and Caesar and Cleopatra (1945). For Romeo and Juliet he also served as Set Decorator. He was Art Director on Caesar and Cleopatra (1945), On Such a Night (1956) and Production Designer on Suddenly Last Summer (1959), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award. == Wartime camouflage == During the Second World War Messel served as a camouflage officer, disguising pillboxes in Somerset. According to his fellow officer Julian Trevelyan, he revelled in the opportunity to give his talents free rein. The disguises of his pillboxes included haystacks, castles, ruins, and roadside cafes.Hamilton, James; Robinson, William Heath. William Heath Robinson. Pavilion, 1995. == Post-war career == In 1946, Messel designed the sets and costumes for the Royal Ballet's new and highly successful production of Tchaikovsky's ballet The Sleeping Beauty, a production which famously starred Margot Fonteyn. It became the first production of the ballet shown on American television, on the program Producers' Showcase. That production, the first ever televised in color, survives on black-and-white kinescope and has been released on DVD. In 2006, it was revived by the Royal Ballet, starring Alina Cojocaru, with some new additions to the scenic design by Peter Farmer, and released on DVD. In 1953, he was commissioned to design the decor for a suite at London's elegant Dorchester Hotel, one in which he would be happy to live himself. The lavishly ornate Oliver Messel Suite, which the hotel advertises as Elizabeth Taylor's favourite place to stay in London, combines baroque and rococo styles with modernist sensibility and a considerable dose of fantasy. The suite, along with other suites that he designed in the Dorchester, are preserved as part of Britain's national heritage. It was restored in the 1980s by many of the original craftsmen, overseen by Messel's nephew, Lord Snowdon (Antony Armstrong-Jones), the former husband of Princess Margaret. By the mid 50s, despite his earlier acclaim, Messel's set designs were viewed in the UK as tired and escapist in comparison to designs that aimed for photographic realism, which were popular at the time. Messel also contributed to retail design, creating the new Delman shoe store for H. & M. Rayne in Old Bond Street in 1960. Whereas upmarket shoe stores had been discreet enclaves dressed with curtains and pot plants, while shoes were consigned to underground stores, this radical refit incorporated display stands and cases, some of them illuminated, to show off hundreds of pairs of shoes. An article in The Observer noted that: \\"Mr Messel and Mr Rayne are at one in thinking that shoes to buy should be as easy to see and handle as books in a library\\". == Messel and the Caribbean == Oliver Messel came from a wealthy, well- connected family, and when his nephew, Antony Armstrong-Jones (Lord Snowdon), married Princess Margaret, a lifelong relationship with the British royal family began. Messel was later to design Les Jolies Eaux, Princess Margaret's home on Mustique Island in The Grenadines (a 45 min flight west of Barbados), and \\"Point Lookout\\" an extraordinary stone beach house on the northern tip of Mustique. In 1966, Messel, exhausted by a demanding theatre season and recurring arthritis, retreated to Barbados and the lush beauty of the eastern Caribbean. He was 62 and at the peak of a career in which he had dazzled three decades of theatre-goers with his fantastic, romantic and inspired stage sets and costumes. The warmth, colour and vibrancy of the tropics seemed to liberate new sources of energy and imagination, leading him to what would eventually become a whole new career in designing, building and transforming homes. Not content to rest there, he also designed many furnishings for these homes, particularly for outdoor use. Messel bought an existing house called Maddox, a simple bay house perched above a small beach on the St. James coast. With the help of his companion Vagn Riis-Hansen, with whom he had a 30-year relationship,Robert Aldrich and Garry Wotherspoon, Who's who in gay and lesbian history, (; Routledge, 2002) pp. 364–65; available at Google books here. and a Barbadian staff, Messel transformed it using the trademarks of his theatrical design: slender Greek columns, flattened arches, white-on-white interiors splashed with bright spots of colour, elaborate plaster mouldings – an easy mix of baroque and classical. It was his use of the materials and traditions of island architecture that was truly innovative. Wealthy friends commissioned Messel to design houses for them, both on Barbados and Mustique, and thus began what architect Barbara Hill described as \\"his work … of converting quite ordinary houses into wonderlands\\". As well as his own home, Maddox, he re-designed and supervised the renovations of Leamington House and Pavilion (for the Heinz family), Crystal Springs, Cockade House, Alan Bay and Fustic House. He designed and built Mango Bay from scratch and was commissioned by the Barbados government to restore the old British officers Garrison headquarters in Queens Park, creating an elegant adaptation of it to a theatre and art gallery. He would probably have gone on to do more on Barbados, but was lured away by his friend Colin Tennant and his private island home, Mustique. Glenconner commissioned Messel to design all the houses built on the island. Between 1960 and 1978 Messel created some 30 house plans, of which over 18 have so far been built. Barbados remained his first island love and his home, and he died there in 1978, at the age of 74. One lasting legacy is that his preferred light sage green shade of paint, now known as \\"Messel Green' by paint companies in the Caribbean, has been immortalised as many property owners choose this colour for its quintessential Caribbean-ness. == References == == Bibliography == * Castle, Charles.

Both festivals are run by Cambridge & District CAMRA. ==Summer Beer Festival== Commemorative glasses from the 2010 Cambridge Beer Festival The summer beer festival has been held at a number of locations in Cambridge. It began at the Cambridge Corn Exchange in 1974 and remained there until 1982. After skipping a year in 1983, it moved between the Guildhall and Midsummer Common before returning to the Corn Exchange in 1988 (the 14th festival). In 1992, it moved to the Cambridge City Football Club ground just off Milton Road where it became an outside festival in huge marquees. During its residency at the football ground time it grew (helped by not being limited by a fixed building) and settled into its now established time of year at the end of May (having previously been held in August). The Winter Beer Festival In 2001 (the 28th festival) it moved to Jesus Green where it has remained ever since. Since moving to Jesus Green it has grown significantly. The location attracts a lot more passing trade than the football ground. The festival is now the second largest in country in terms of visitors (behind the Great British Beer Festival). In 2006 it had over 170 real ales, 50 ciders and perries as well as a large range of foreign beers and country wines. 2007 was another record-breaking year, with 30,384 visitors, who drank 494 kilderkins (about 70,000 pints) of beer and 194 tubs (about 7,700 pints) of cider and perry.\\"Ale\\", Cambridge & District CAMRA Branch newsletter, Issue 329.

The organisers and staff are all unpaid volunteers. As a thank you for their effort they receive lunch and dinner (when working), together with free or discounted beer. Each year the festival gives a charity the opportunity to raise funds during the event. In 2018, Stars, who provide specialist bereavement support and counselling for young people in Cambridgeshire, raised over £18,500. ==Winter Beer Festival== Cambridge Winter Beer Festival at the University Social Club The Winter Beer Festival is held in November at the Cambridge University Social Club, Mill Lane, Cambridge CB2 1RX.

After the winter festival in January 2018, the two festivals were merged into a single Winter Beer Festival held annually in November, six months after the summer festival.

In particular, the book is concerned with establishing, in intricate detail, the religious beliefs and practices of English society in the century or so preceding the reign of Henry VIII. The main thesis of Duffy's book is that the Roman Catholic faith was in rude and lively health prior to the English Reformation. Duffy's argument was written as a counterpoint to the prevailing historical belief that the Roman Catholic faith in England was a decaying force, theologically spent and unable to provide sufficient spiritual sustenance for the population at large. Taking a broad range of evidence (accounts, wills, primers, memoirs, rood screens, stained glass, joke-books, graffiti, etc.), Duffy argues that every aspect of religious life prior to the Reformation was undertaken with well-meaning piety. Feast days were celebrated, fasts solemnly observed, churches decorated, images venerated, candles lit and prayers for the dead recited with regularity. Pre-Reformation Catholicism was, he argues, a deeply popular religion, practised by all sections of society, whether noble or peasant. Earlier historians’ claims that English religious practice was becoming more individualised (with different strata of society having radically different religious lives) is contested by Duffy insisting on the continuing ‘corporate’ nature of the late medieval Catholic Church, i.e. where all members were consciously and willingly part of a single institution. The second part of Duffy's book concentrates on the accelerated implementation of Protestantism in the mid sixteenth century. It charts how society reacted to Henrician, Edwardian and Elizabethan reform and the changes in religious practice this entailed. Duffy uncovers a succession of records, notes and images that individually reveal an assortment of changes to liturgy and custom but taken together build up to demonstrate a colossal change in English religious practice. So we see how candlesticks and church plate had to be melted down and sold off, altar tables removed, rood screens defaced or torn down and chasubles unstitched. How walls were whitewashed, relics discarded and paintings of saints hidden in parishioners’ houses. And we also read how the other aspects of the Catholic community, such as the guild groups or particular local feast days, quickly collapsed without the economic or religious practices on which they depended. It was a painful process for Catholics, and Duffy vividly illustrates the confusion and disappointment of Catholics stripped of their familiar spiritual nourishment. (One of Duffy's later studies, The Voices of Morebath: Reformation and Rebellion in an English Village, focuses on how one particular Devon village reacted to these changes.) Duffy also uses to the second section to highlight the brief flame of optimism felt by Catholics ignited by the reign of the Catholic Mary from 1553 to 1558, a flame quickly extinguished by Mary's death. But ultimately, the Marian reign is a secondary issue. Duffy's narrative demonstrates how centuries of religious practice evaporated in the face of fierce centralist control. ==Critical reception== Upon its publication, the book was hailed an original and persuasive account of English Catholicism in the Late Middle Ages. Writing in the New York Review of Books, British historian Maurice Keen stated, > Perhaps it takes an Irishman to offer Englishmen (and others) a convincing > picture of the religion of the ordinary lay people of England in the age > before the Reformation. ...The evocation of [medieval Roman Catholicism,] > that older, pre-Reformation tradition and of what its observances meant to > the laity of its time is the theme of the first part of Dr. Duffy's deeply > imaginative, movingly written, and splendidly illustrated study.New York > Review of Books, Sept. 23, 1993 Writing in the London Review of Books in 2002, Patrick Collinson said that The Stripping of the Altars \\"opened our eyes to the vitality of late medieval English Catholicism\\".London Review of Books, 25 April 2002 In a review of a new edition published in 2005, The Atlantic the magazine's literary editor, Benjamin Schwarz, called it > [A] vigorous and eloquent book, a work of daring revision and a masterpiece > of the historical imagination.... At once meticulous and lush, The Stripping > of the Altars patiently and systematically recovers the lost world of > medieval English Catholicism. ...[W]hile the first two-thirds of this book > is a deeply textured work of historical anthropology, the last third is a > gripping narrative history, as Duffy traces the way the English Reformation > (a process supported by a tiny minority, and deeply if ineffectively opposed > by a population cowed by the new and crushing force of the monarchy) > eradicated a thousand years of tradition and ritual. ... Duffy's most > significant contribution by far is to elucidate the fragility of even deeply > rooted ways of life: he convincingly demonstrates that for better or worse, > the Reformation was \\"a great cultural hiatus, which had dug a ditch, deep > and dividing, between the English people and their past\\"—a past that over > merely three generations became a distant world, impossible for them to look > back on as their own.The Atlantic, Oct. 2005 ==Counterargument== In his 2001 biography of Bible translator William Tyndale, David Daniell, emeritus professor of English at University College London,David Daniell official website criticised Duffy's belief that an English bible would have come about sooner or later, within the framework of pre-Reformation Catholicism, and that Nicholas Love's translation of The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ largely satisfied lay needs for the New Testament. Daniell claimed that Love's book actually contained little of Christ's teaching and a large amount of invented material not in the Gospels.David Daniell, William Tyndale. A Biography (Yale University Press, 2001), pp. 96–100. Daniell argued that: > Catholic revisionist historians miss the point...The Church would never > permit a complete printed New Testament in English from the Greek, because > in that New Testament can be found neither the Seven Sacraments nor the > doctrine of purgatory, two chief sources of the Church's power...An > elementary working knowledge of the Bible, the ultimate root of the > Christian faith, could only have been developed within > Protestantism...[Catholic] piety and practice, in many ways admirable, we > must reply, was imprisoned in a little world of recent Church tradition, > while the vast continents of historic Bible revelation, towered over by the > mountain range of Paul's theology, were forbidden territory...during the > English Reformation, lay men and women were so hungry for the Bible in > English that they were often prepared to die for it. Nobody was burned alive > for The Little Hours of the Virgin. There were nine printed editions of Love > up to 1530, and none after, as Tyndale's New Testaments arrived.Daniell, p. > 100. When evaluating these claims and counterclaims one should keep in mind the extent to which parts of the Bible had been translated into English well before the 16th century, as well as the Biblical instruction conveyed through the religious theatre that developed throughout the Middle Ages. Further, the popularity of the various forms of the Devotio Moderna, which included the reading of Scripture, praying the Psalms, and such works as The Imitation of Christ in the years preceding the Reformation,Jordan Aumann, Christian Spirituality in the Catholic Tradition, http://www.domcentral.org/study/aumann/cs/cs07.htm#DM as well as the many sermons and homilies explicating sacred Scripture, delivered to the people through the Middle Ages (many of which are preserved to this day and so can make manifest the depth of Biblical teaching contained therein)As an example, see the sermons of St. Thomas Aquinas on sacred Scripture, (http://www.home.duq.edu/~bonin/thomasbibliography.html#scripture); cf. The International Medieval Sermon Studies Society's website and work: http://imsss.net/; for an attempt at a comprehensive listing of surviving medieval homilies and sermons, see indicate the extent to which the Bible's teaching reached the common person. ==References== ==Further reading== * online edition Category:1992 non-fiction books Category:20th-century history books Category:History books about England Category:History books about Christianity Category:Books about Christianity Category:Yale University Press books Category:English Reformation Category:Catholic Church in England and Wales ","title":"The Stripping of the Altars"},{"id":"7773154","text":"Daniel O'Boyle (died November 1933) was a Catholic Irish publican murdered by Protestant loyalists in 1933.

Radio publicity stills such as these were never as common as photos of actors at microphones. They were usually shot at an exterior location with a minimum of props and costumes in a spontaneous, near-improvised attempt to recreate the audio characters. The Romance of Helen Trent was a radio soap opera which aired on CBS from October 30, 1933 to June 24, 1960 for a total of 7,222 episodes. The show was created by Frank and Anne Hummert, who were among the most prolific producers during the radio soap era. The program opened with: :And now, The Romance of Helen Trent, the real-life drama of Helen Trent, who, when life mocks her, breaks her hopes, dashes her against the rocks of despair, fights back bravely, successfully, to prove what so many women long to prove, that because a woman is 35 or more, romance in life need not be over, that romance can begin at 35. ==Characters and story== The storyline revolved around a 35-year-old dressmaker who fascinates men as she works her way up to become the chief Hollywood costumer designer. Helen was played by three different actresses (Virginia Clark, Betty Ruth Smith and Julie Stevens).Terrace, Vincent (1999). Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 289. Virginia Clark did the role for 11 years, and Julie Stevens portrayed Helen for 16 years. Stevens, who had recently finished playing the title role on the radio soap Kitty Foyle, was only 22 when she joined the cast. She continued in the role from 1944 to the show's cancellation in 1960. Stevens was married to a US Steel executive Charles Underhill, and while portraying Helen Trent during 1951–52, she made her television debut as the female lead of Lorelei Kilbourne on the Big Town television series. thumb Stevens said she saw Helen as being similar to Edith Head. Stevens felt her character was boring and remembered the director allowed the actors to \\"fall around and scream with laughter during rehearsals. We had to keep our sanity. By air time we had gotten it all out of our systems and could be dead serious about the story.\\" During the 7,222 episodes (more than any other radio soap), Helen never married, and she always remained at the age of 35. However, she had a long-running beau, Gil Whitney. An unusual incident occurred during a 1948 broadcast, as documented in Tune in Tomorrow (1968), the memoir by Mary Jane Higby, who portrayed Cynthia Carter on the program. As Gil attempted to convince Helen of his love for her, Helen again demurred and hesitated. Suddenly, a voice came over the airwaves, saying, \\"Ah, for chrissakes, lay the dame and get it over with!\\" As crew members tried to locate the voice inside the studio, the man proceeded to give sexually graphic examples of what Gil should do with Helen. In spite of the shock, there were few protests from listeners. In one of the opening scenes of the 1956 film The Catered Affair filmed in the fall of 1955, an episode of the show is playing on the radio as Tom Hurley arrives home from his night job as a taxi driver. ==See also== *List of radio soaps ==Further reading== *LaGuardia, Robert.

He is Mr Jaggers's clerk and the protagonist Pip's friend. Some scholars consider him to be the \\"most modern man in the book\\".Pickrel, Paul. Great Expectations. Additionally, Wemmick is noted as one of Dickens's \\"most successful\\" split characters, insofar as Wemmick's character represents an exploration of the \\"relationship between public and private spheres in a divided existence\\".Lecker, Barbara. SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500–1900. Rice University. ==Profession== John Wemmick is a bill collector for the lawyer Mr. Jaggers. The job requires a demanding, uncaring attitude, a personality the working Wemmick takes on. To impress and stay in the favour of his boss, Mr. Jaggers, he berates Jaggers's clients with disdain. He is described as having \\"the same air of knowing something to everybody else's disadvantage, as his master had\\". His professional attitude contrasts with Wemmick's more outwardly pleasant home and personal life. Jaggers is a self centered man who does not seem to pay Wemmick well. When Pip tries to buy a boat he makes fun of him, calling the young boy poor. ==Portable property== Wemmick often ventures to Newgate Prison to speak with prisoners currently being represented by Jaggers, or already condemned to die after Jaggers's appointment to them. When Wemmick talks to a prisoner that has been condemned to die, he does his best to take whatever valuable artifacts they may have with them off their hands. This he calls their \\"portable property\\". Wemmick does this out of a sense of necessity, given his financially challenged status. ==Relation with Pip== At one point in the novel, Wemmick advises Pip to acquire his benefactor Magwitch's \\"portable property\\". He argues that despite Pip's noble intentions to help Magwitch, the pragmatic course of action would be to prepare for failure. In acquiring Magwitch's \\"portable property,\\" Pip would at least be guaranteed his money. After he sends back Magwitch's pocketbook, Pip feels glad despite Wemmick's advice. In the end, Pip forfeits all that Magwitch intended for him to have. ==Personal life== Mr. Wemmick and \\"The Aged P.\\", illustration by Sol Eytinge Jr. Wemmick owns a house in Walworth which is modelled as a castle, complete with a drawbridge, cannon and moat. Wemmick feels protected from the harsh realities of his profession by his house. As Wemmick tells Pip, \\"the office is one thing, and private life is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me.\\" He lives with his father, who is referred to as \\"The Aged Parent\\", \\"The Aged P.\\", or simply \\"The Aged\\", a deaf man. Wemmick's ingenuity is seen in ways to communicate with his father, as when he returns from work a tile appears reading \\"John\\", signaling his father to lower the drawbridge. Every evening at 9 PM Wemmick fires a cannon known as \\"The Stinger\\", which is the only object the Aged Parent has the ability to hear. He is engaged to marry Miss Skiffins, a source of joy in his life. His behaviour with Miss Skiffins is another indication of Wemmick's split character status. In his personal life Wemmick, for the first time, also reveals a \\"sexuality which Dickens comically depicts in his relationship with the brightly apparelled but wooden Miss Skiffins.\\" Pip approves of Wemmick's behaviour around Miss Skiffins, insofar as it humanizes him. This is contrasted with Pip's observation of Wemmick's behaviour in the presence of Jaggers, which he compares to his behaviour around Miss Skiffins by saying \\"there were twin Wemmicks and this was the wrong one.\\"Lecker, Barbara.

Samuel Hiestand's parents, grandparents, and several generations before were all Mennonites and not Moravians as reported in some sources.Hiestand (Histand, Heistand, Heystandt) family. Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online His uncle Henry Brumbach was a Mennonite minister as was his brother Abraham Hiestand, of the Page area, who signed himself in 1794 as \\"minister of the Church of the Mennonite Society\\" before becoming a United Brethren minister. Between adhering to the Mennonite faith and joining the United Brethren Church, Samuel Hiestand's family associated with the Primitive Baptist. They had belonged to the Mennonite congregation at the White House Church, which became the Mill Creek Baptist Church under the mennonite Minister Martin Kauffman (Coffman) Sr. and the Baptist preacher Elder John Koontz (Countz, Koonts,) who owned land next to the Hiestand's. Rev. John Koontz officiated the marriages of Samuel's siblings; Jacob (1784), Abraham (1787 to the widow of Mennonite Minister Jacob Strickler), Elizabeth (1784), Magdalena(1788) and John Hiestand (1794 to the daughter of Mennonite Minister Jacob Strickler).Church and Family History Research Assistance for Page County, VirginiaThe Mill Creek Church Martin Kauffman Sr. and other former Mennonite members withdrew from this Baptist church during the Revolutionary War when its leaders called for their armed participation. \\"In 1793 Martin Kauffman, in the name of the 'Separatist Independent Baptist Church,' petitioned the government of Virginia for military exemption for his people similar to that accorded the Mennonites and Quakers.\\"Brunk, Harry A. History of Mennonites in Virginia, 1727-1900., Staunton: McCclure Printing Co., Staunton, Va., 1959. From Christian Newcomer's Journal we know Samuel's family was already associated with the Church of the United Brethren in Christ and one of its founders as early as 1796. \\"On the 20th [October 1796] I rode to Messinurte; on the 21st preached here with uncommon liberty, from Matthew 5 — v. 3. At candle light, I spoke at Br. Hiestand's, from Psalm 44-v. 15. The people here are rather hardened: may God have mercy on them.\\" \\"5th [August 1799]—After considerable enquiry and difficult search, I this day arrived at Br. Hiestand's, where I lodged for the night.\\" \\"6th [December 1799]—Br. Hiestand preached this day at my house.\\"Newcomer, Christian, \\"The life and journal of the Rev'd Christian Newcomer, late bishop of the church of the United brethren in Christ.\\", translated by John Hildt, printed by F. G. W. Kapp, 1834. After Martin Kauffman Sr.'s death, a disagreement in the practice of slavery resulted in Martin Kauffman Jr., Lewis Seitz (Seits), and Samuel Comer separating from the Mill Creek Church with a group of followers moved to Fairfield County, Ohio, where they formed Pleasant Run Baptist Church, named after the nearby stream, in Pleasant Township. Samuel's mother and nephew Martin Hiestand are listed as members of this congregation in 1806–1809.Strickler, Harry M., A short history of Page County, Virginia., Dietz Press, Richmond, 1952.Pleasant Run Primitive Baptist Church Samuel had made a profession of faith in Jesus Christ early in life. But his real conversion occurred under the influence of the Rev. George Benedum, a noted early itinerant minister. Benedum had come from Pennsylvania to Ohio in 1806, two years after the Hiestand brothers. Benedum immediately began preaching, and he and Abraham Hiestand became the leaders of the U.B. movement in Fairfield County and neighboring communities. And it was upon these two Christian leaders the Bishop Christian Newcomer called when he first visited Ohio in 1810. ==Call to ministry== Soon after Benedum's arrival Samuel Hiestand was awakened to a new sense of Christian obligation. Almost immediately he began traveling with Benedum through Fairfield County and the surrounding area. Indeed, Samuel came to be regarded Benedum's \\"apprentice.\\" Samuel's entrance into the ministry was a natural consequence of this association. He was Licensed to Exhort by the Miami Annual Conference of the U.B. Church in 1819. He was Licensed to Preach in 1820. ==Ordained ministry== The Rev. Samuel Hiestand became of great service to the U.B. Church nearly from the start of his ministry. For example, though he was licensed to preach only in 1820, he served as the Secretary of the U.B. general conference of 1821. Indeed, the minutes of that conference show he was active in such important deliberations as the mode of Baptism to be practiced by this denomination, the discontinuance of the ordination of Bishops, and the establishment of the office of Presiding Elder as a full-time position. Rev. Hiestand was named one of the incorporators of \\"The Benevolent Society of the United Brethren in Christ\\" in the charter granted it by the Ohio Legislature in 1826. When the Scioto Annual Conference was formed in Ohio in 1824, the Rev. Samuel Hiestand became a \\"charter member,\\" since he lived within its bounds. His itinerancy within this conference included the Adelphos, Muskingum, Washington, and other circuits. ==Ministerial remuneration== Samuel Hiestand ministered in a period when salaries were pitifully small. In 1832, for example, while appointed to the Muskingum Circuit, he and the Junior Preacher with him received together only $155.80. Another year, when he received $93 for his services, it was the highest salary any preacher in the Conference received that year! Indeed, no one could ever suggest that the Circuit Riders of the early days entered upon their duties with any idea of becoming wealthy! ==Effectiveness in ministry== Samuel Hiestand was a thoroughly effective Pastor. The quiet, thoughtful influence of his Moravian background reflected in his preaching. One who knew him well said this of him: :He was a man of deep piety, a faithful and efficient expounder of the Holy Scriptures, by no means an orator, but a close practical reasoner. No many could be in his company without feeling that in him were sweetly blended the true characteristics of a friend, a Christian and a divine. ==Episcopal ministry== The Rev. Hiestand was a member of the 1833 General Conference, too. This Conference authorized the printing establishment of the denomination, and the beginning of a denominational paper. Another action by this Conference also had a large impact on his ministry. Because of the death of Bishop Newcomer three years earlier, Henry Kumler Sr served to the end of the quadrennium as the only Bishop of the Church. The General Conference decided that because of the expanding Church and the increasing demands of time, travel, and the strength of its leaders, three Bishops should be elected. When the voting was complete, Bishop Kumler was re-elected, and Samuel Hiestand and the Rev. William Brown were elected to serve with him! ==Death and funeral== \\"His sickness commenced last spring, with indigestion or dyspepsia, and continued till some days before his death; when he was taken with a nervous fever and head pleurisy. His mind was strong and active, until about three or four days before his exit from this world,—when it became somewhat impaired and flighty. His brother (Joseph) had some conversation with him, on the day before his mind began to fail, and he told him that he had, during that day, felt the sweet drawings of heaven more powerfully, than he ever did before; and when his speech had failed, and he heard any one talk of heaven, he would immediately smile, as if anxious to depart, and to possess it for ever.\\"Religious Telescope October 31, 1838 United Brethren Obituaries \\"On the 11th of October, 1838, a large concourse of ministers, friends, and neighbors convened at the late residence of Bishop Hiestand. Rev. Jacob Winter preached in German, and Jacob Miller in English, after which the bishop was buried, according to his previous request, beside his pious mother, in the Hiestand burying-ground,Now the Bethel Cemetery located in Greenville township a mile away on the corner of Stringtown Rd and County Rd 17. in the north-east corner of his farm, in Liberty Township, Fairfield County, Ohio.

They went on hiatus in 2002 and reunited in 2013. ==History== ===Formation=== The Gathering Field legacy began in a burned-out third floor in Grove City, Pennsylvania, when Bill Deasy, Dave Brown and Rusted Root percussionist Jim DiSpirito \\"isolated themselves for the weekend with guitars, tequila, microphones and recording gear\\". An obscure, rare recording was born out of that weekend, appropriately titled \\"The Lost Weekend\\", which was never made commercially available. ===Career=== The Gathering Field line-up ultimately became Deasy on vocals and acoustic guitar, Brown on lead guitar, Eric Riebling on bass and Ray DeFade as drummer. Their first independent release, the self-titled The Gathering Field, was met with great reception around the region and they started playing to packed clubs. However, the band's popularity really skyrocketed when one of the region's most powerful rock radio stations, WDVE, began playing a song called, \\"Lost in America\\". The song remained in rotation for over seven months. Based on the success of the self-titled CD, the group garnered a major label deal with Atlantic Records, who re-released their album. Soon after they signed to Atlantic Records and \\"Lost in America\\" was re-released, there was turmoil at the label. The album charted on the Billboard Top 100 album chart, Radio and Records and various other industry publications but ultimately the CD and group got lost in the shuffle and they attempted to be released from their contract. DeFade left the group and was replaced with Joe Zelek. When they finally succeeded, they released two more CDs; Reliance and So Close to Home, the latter consisting of songs the band had played live for several years but never recorded. During that time Deasy also released a semi-acoustic solo album called Spring Lies Waiting, produced by Brown. ===Hiatus=== Refusing to use the words \\"break-up\\" when describing their status, The Gathering Field went on an \\"infinite hiatus\\" in 2002. Deasy now records as a solo artist and continues to be a prolific songwriter. His song \\"Good Things Are Happening\\" was the theme for ABC's Good Morning America from 2001 to 2004. Since his departure from The Gathering Field, he has recorded with artists such as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp and Patty Griffin. His music has been recorded by Martina McBride, Billy Ray Cyrus, Howard Jones, Kim Richey and The Clarks. Zelek formed the Joe Zelek Band. They had their music used by television stations such as WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio, WFTV in Orlando, Florida, and Fox Sports West in Los Angeles, California. The band has also played the main stage at the Jamboree in the Hills since 2007. Riebling continues to record music, and has emerged as a web designer for several artists and groups that he has been associated with. ===Reunion=== In November 2013, Bill Deasy announced during an interview on WYEP that the Gathering Field was reuniting and would immediately begin playing live shows again.

First published in 1999 as the result of a debate among American academics, politicians, and journalists, the list is now a highly publicized annual event. Appearing on the list is often seen as an honor, and Time makes it clear that entrants are recognized for changing the world, regardless of the consequences of their actions. The final list of influential individuals is exclusively chosen by Time editors, with nominations coming from the Time 100 alumni and the magazine's international writing staff. Only the winner of the Reader's Poll, conducted days before the official list is revealed, is chosen by the general public. The corresponding commemorative gala is held annually in Manhattan, New York. ==Selection criteria== In 2004, Time editors identified \\"three rather distinct qualities\\" when choosing people to be listed.

Welcome to this year's Time 100.\\" The announcement was celebrated with a black tie event in New York City on April 26, 2011. The honorees were joined by A-list celebrities at the Jazz at Lincoln Center for the event. Time readers contributed to the selection through an online vote of over 200 finalists. The list included familiar leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama and Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, as well as \\"newcomers\\" to the global press. The list included numerous figures representing the Arab Spring in the Middle East, including rebels, political leaders, and news correspondents. Media figures unrelated to the Arab Spring were also listed. Additionally, Prince William and Kate Middleton were part of the list during the week before their wedding. The list also included Katsunobu Sakurai, the mayor of Minamisōma, Fukushima, which was the city most affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. === 2012–13 === * List of individuals included in the Time 100 in 2012 * List of individuals included in the Time 100 in 2013 ===2014=== * List of individuals included in the Time 100 in 2014 Revealed on April 24, 2014, the list featured Beyoncé on the U.S. cover and Robert Redford, Jason Collins, and Mary Barra on international covers.

These sculptures were produced by Swarovski. ==Controversies== === Controversies over exclusions === The exclusion of then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair from the 2004 list caused mild controversy. Time editor- at-large Michael J. Elliott defended the decision to consistently exclude Blair, saying that \\"Gerhard Schröder and Jacques Chirac are not there either. This is a worldwide list. There are no Western European political leaders on it because they are not that powerful or influential at this time\\". Although George W. Bush has been on the list several times, controversy emerged when he was dropped from the list in 2007 in part because of the Democratic victory in the 2006 congressional election. Former Senator Rick Santorum (R–PA) of Fox News said: > The fact of the matter is, the president of the United States, I don't care > who's in that office, is the most powerful man on the face of the Earth and > has more influence over various aspects of lives, not just in this country, > but around the world. And for Time magazine to dismiss that just shows you > how biased and, I would argue, hateful they are. Adi Ignatius, Times deputy managing editor who oversaw the list at the time, explained that \\"any U.S. president has a certain built-in influence ... Bush had actually squandered some of that built-in influence. His position on Iraq has cost him support in his own party. ... To a certain point, he sort of reached a lame-duck status\\". === Controversies over inclusions === The list has also generated controversy over inclusions. In 2005, conservative commentator Ann Coulter was listed, which led Salon to observe: > When Time magazine named Ann Coulter among its 100 \\"most influential people\\" > last week, alongside such heavyweights as Ariel Sharon, Bill Clinton, Nelson > Mandela, Kim Jong-il, and the Dalai Lama, the choice produced guffaws > online. Plugging the issue on Fox News last week, Time executive editor > Priscilla Painton insisted it was Coulter's use of \\"humor\\" that made her so > influential, stopping just short of suggesting that Coulter is the > conservative Jon Stewart. But even Fox's Bill O'Reilly wasn't buying it. He > pressed Painton: \\"Do you think people, Americans, listen to Ann Coulter? Do > you think she has influence in public opinion?\\" Time magazine defended Coulter as a bestselling author whose controversial commentary strongly affected political debates in the U.S. Coulter did not, however, make additional appearances on the list. === Mistakes === In February 2016, Time included the male British author Evelyn Waugh on its \\"100 Most Read Female Writers in College Classes\\" list, generating media attention and concerns regarding fact-checking at the magazine. Time later issued a retraction. In a BBC interview with Justin Webb, Oxford professor Valentine Cunningham said the mistake was \\"a piece of profound ignorance on the part of Time magazine\\". ==Use in academic research== The Time 100 was cited in a 2008 academic analysis by Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore, economists at the University of Maryland, College Park. In light of Oprah Winfrey at that time holding the record for most appearances on the Time 100, the economists decided to measure if Winfrey was influential enough to decide a U.S. presidential election by examining the impact of her endorsement of Barack Obama for president. The economists wrote the following: > Oprah Winfrey is a celebrity of nearly unparalleled influence. She has been > named to Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people six > times—more than any other individual, including the Dalai Lama, Nelson > Mandela, Bill Gates, George Clooney, and Rupert Murdoch. She was named one > of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, an honor shared with > Albert Einstein, Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) Gandhi, and Franklin D. > Roosevelt. She was only one of four people who were included on these lists > in both the 20th and 21st century. The others included Mandela, Gates, and > Pope John Paul II. ... The scope of Winfrey's influence creates a unique > opportunity to examine the effect of endorsements on political outcomes. The economists found a statistically significant correlation between the number of Winfrey fans in a geographic region (as estimated by magazine sales and book club selections) and the number of votes Obama received in that region during the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. They found that the correlation even held up when they controlled for all kinds of confounding variables like race, gender, income, education, and sales of other magazines. They further found that the correlation only emerged after Winfrey had endorsed Obama, suggesting that it was the influence of her endorsement that caused the correlation. When they statistically removed the correlation to see how Obama would have performed without Winfrey's endorsement, they found that over one million votes vanished from Obama's total in the Democratic primary and that Clinton received far more votes.The Role of Celebrity Endorsements in Politics: Oprah, Obama, and the 2008 Democratic Primary . == The 25 Most Influential People on the Internet == Since 2015, Time has also published a list titled \\"The 25 Most Influential People on the Internet\\", which features people whose influence and dominance may have changed Internet culture; who have support, position, and prominence in various sections of social media; or who use and/or rely on the Internet as a platform for change. People who have been listed range from political figures, such as Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to teenage YouTubers, such as JoJo Siwa and Emma Chamberlain. Others who have been listed include Lil Nas X, whose debut hit broke the record for most weeks spent atop the Billboard chart after being created and distributed on the Internet, and actress and presenter Jameela Jamil, who is known more widely beyond her profession for her online activism. == See also == * Time Person of the Year * Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century ==References== Category:Top people lists ","title":"Time 100"},{"id":"7773238","text":"Bimelech (February 27, 1937 – 1966) was a champion Thoroughbred racehorse who won two Triple Crown races and was a Champion at both age two and three. He was ranked #84 among U.S. racehorses of the 20th century. After retiring to stud, he sired 30 stakes winners and his daughters produced 50 stakes winners. ==Early life== Bimelech was foaled at Colonel E. R. Bradley's Idle Hour Stock Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. Colonel Bradley named this latest La Troienne foal after a friend, John Harris, who went by the nickname Abimelech. He dropped the \\"A\\" because he gave his horses names that began with a \\"B\\". Bimelech was the last colt sired by Bradley's major stallion, Black Toney, and was a full brother to Black Helen, the 1935 Champion three-year-old filly. (Black Toney was also the sire of Hall of Famer Black Gold.) ==Racing career== Bimelech was undefeated as a two-year-old, winning his first over maidens at Suffolk Downs by three lengths. In his next race, an allowance at Empire City, he wired the field. Bimelech's first stakes race was at Saratoga Race Course, where he defeated Briar Sharp and Andy K. in the Saratoga Special Stakes. He then went on to win the Hopeful Stakes by a neck. He ended his first season with a length and a half victory in the Belmont Futurity Stakes and a four length win in the Pimlico Futurity. Bimelech was named American Champion Two- Year-Old Colt. He was also the Experimental Free Handicap Highweight at 130 pounds, a prodigious weight for a young horse. He became the favorite to win the 1940 Kentucky Derby; his winterbook odds of three to one were the lowest odds ever quoted for a Derby favorite up to that time. In his first race as a three-year-old, Bimelech took the Blue Grass Stakes by two and a half lengths. He then won the Derby Trial Stakes, beating a colt from Milky Way Farm Stable called Gallahadion. Still undefeated, Bimelech was the overwhelming choice for the Derby, which had had its purse raised to $75,000 added. It was his third start in 8 days. At six to one, Charles S. Howard's Mioland was the bettor's second choice. (Howard owned and raced the famous Seabiscuit.) Gallahadion was thirty-five to one. In the Derby, Bimelech drifted farther and farther out from the rail and ran wide the entire race. The longer distance left him exhausted in the last few furlongs. Gallahadion passed him in the final furlong. Bimelech's jockey, Fred Smith, took the blame for the loss. A short time later, Bimelech beat Gallahadion in the Preakness. He ran second in the Withers Stakes, but records indicate this was due to poor preparation. So after the Withers, Bimelech went into heavy training), and won the Belmont Stakes. He struggled to win his next race, and it was discovered he was racing with an injured foot, which ended his racing that year. He took that year's honor of American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. When the new starting gates were introduced, Bimelech acted very badly while being loaded into the gate. After two races, Bradley retired his horse, fearing Bimelech would hurt himself. ==Stud record== In 1946, Bradley died and all his horses were sold. A syndicate (Greentree Stud, King Ranch, and Ogden Phipps) bought Bimelech. They stood him at Greentree Stud, where he sired 30 stakes winners, including these multiple stakes-winners: * Alfoxie, won Laurel Stakes and Jasmine Stakes * Bassanio, won Monmouth Handicap and USA Sussex Handicap * Be Faithful, won Beverly Handicap (twice) etc.; was the second dam of Never Bend. He also sired Better Self, the broodmare sire of Dr. Fager. * Better Self, won Saratoga Handicap etc.; the damsire of Dr. Fager. * Blue Border, won Palm Beach Handicap and Shevlin Stakes etc. * Bradley, won Great American Stakes and Sanford Stakes * Brookfield (Domino Handicap and Wilmington Handicap) * Burning Dream (American Handicap and San Francisco County Handicap) * Bymeabond (Santa Anita Derby and San Jose Handicap) * Getthere Jack (Great American Stakes and Tremont Stakes) * Guillotine (Lincoln's Birthday Handicap and Futurity Stakes etc.) * Jabneh (Hialeah Turf Handicap, Longfellow Handicap) * Laugh (USA Albany Stakes and Flash Stakes) * Torch Of War (Churchill Downs Handicap and USA de Soto Handicap) * Well Away (La Centinela Stakes and Yo Tambien Handicap) Daughters of Bimelech produced 50 stakes winners. Bimelech died in 1966. ==Legacy== Bimelech was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1990. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century, Bimelech was ranked number 84. ==Pedigree== ==References== *Bimelech's page in the Hall of Fame Category:1937 racehorse births Category:1966 racehorse deaths Category:Thoroughbred family 1-x Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Belmont Stakes winners Category:Preakness Stakes winners Category:United States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees Category:United States Champion Thoroughbred Sires Category:American Champion racehorses ","title":"Bimelech"},{"id":"7773243","text":"Palghat Anantharama Bhagavatar was a noted exponent of Carnatic vocal music who lived between 1850 and 1920.

While some traditional accounts portray these two figures as the same woman, they (and their relatives) lived in differing periods. ==Ragnhild, second wife of Halfdan the Elder== According to Heimskringla, a Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter was the second wife of Halfdan the Elder. (The first being Ragnhild Haraldsdotter Gulskeg.) Hake, a berserker encountered her father in Hadeland and killed him, before kidnapping Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter from her home. Halfdan the Elder then had her kidnapped from Hake, so that he could marry her. Fagrskinna does not mention any of these details. However, both sagas agree that Ragnhild and Halfdan The Elder were the parents of Harald Fairhair. ==Ragnhild, daughter of Sigurd Hart == According to the Ragnarssona þáttr, Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter, daughter of Sigurd Hart and his wife Ingeborg (\\"Ingibjorg\\") was the granddaughter of Helgi the Sharp and Aslaug. Her maternal grandfather was Harald Klak. The identity of her maternal grandmother is not mentioned.The Tale of Ragnar's Sons\\", chapter 4.

That is, most sources suggest that Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye was active only in the late 9th century, which would mean that he was either about the same age as Ragnhild or younger. ==Traditional accounts== ;Ragnarssona þáttr According to the Ragnarssona þáttr, \\"Sigurd Hart. Of all the men ever seen, he was the fairest, and the biggest, and the strongest. They were the same age, Gorm Knutsson and Sigurd Hart. When Sigurd was twelve, he killed the berserk Hildibrand in a duel, and he single-handedly slew twelve men in that fight. After that Klakk-Harald gave him his daughter, who was called Ingibjorg. They had two children: Gudthorm and Ragnhild.\\"\\"The Tale of Ragnar's Sons\\", chapter 4. Translation by Peter Tunstall \\"Then Sigurd learnt that King Frodi, his father's brother, was dead. He went north to Norway and became king over Ringerike, his inheritance. There is a long story told of him, as he did all manner of mighty deeds. But it's said of his passing, that he rode out hunting in the wilderness, as was his custom, and Haki Hadaberserk came at him with thirty fully armed men and they fought with him.\\"Tale of Ragnar's Sons,\\" chapter 4.

Afterwards Haki and his men rode to Ringerike, to Stein, where Sigurd's dwelling was, and took away Ragnhild his daughter, and his son Gudthorm, and plenty of goods too, and carried them off home with him to Hadeland. And soon after that, he had a great feast prepared and meant to celebrate his wedding, but it was put off because his wounds weren't healing. Ragnhild was fifteen years old then, and Gudthorm fourteen. Autumn passed, and Haki was laid up with his wounds till Yule.\\"\\"The Tale of Ragnar's Sons\\", chapter 4. Translation by Peter Tunstall \\"At this time, King Halfdan the Black was staying at his estate in Hedmark. He sent Harek Gand with a hundred and twenty men, and they marched over the frozen Lake Mjøsa to Hadeland one night and came the next morning to King Haki's home and seized all the doors of the hall where the retainers were sleeping. And then they went to King Haki's bedroom and took Ragnhild and Gudthorm, her brother, and all the treasure that was there, and carry it off with them. They burnt all the retainers in their hall and then leave. But King Haki got up and got dressed and went after them for a while. But when he came to the ice, he turned down his sword-hilt to the ground and fell on the point and met his death there, and he's buried on the bank of the lake.\\"\\"The Tale of Ragnar's Sons\\", chapter 4. Translation by Peter Tunstall \\"King Halfdan saw them coming over the ice with a covered wagon and guessed their mission had gone exactly as he wished. He had a message sent then to all the settlements and invited to all the important people in Hedmark to a big feast that very day. There he celebrated his wedding to Ragnhild, and they lived together for many years after. Their son was King Harald the Fine-Haired, who was first to become sole ruler over the whole of Norway.\\"\\"The Tale of Ragnar's Sons\\", chapter 4. Translation by Peter Tunstall The \\"Ragnarssona þáttr\\" was preserved in the Hauksbók by Haukr Erlendsson. The book is a collection of Old Norse tales and was compiled in the early 14th century.Rory McTurk, \\"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\\" ;Heimskringla A similar account is given in the \\"Saga of Halfdan the Black\\", part of the Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson. The Kings' sagas included were written in the 13th century. \\"Sigurd Hjort was the name of a king in Ringerike, who was stouter and stronger than any other man, and his equal could not be seen for a handsome appearance. His father was Helge Hvasse (the Sharp); and his mother was Aslaug, a daughter of Sigurd the worm-eyed, who again was a son of Ragnar Lodbrok. It is told of Sigurd that when he was only twelve years old he killed in single combat the berserk Hildebrand, and eleven others of his comrades; and many are the deeds of manhood told of him in a long saga about his feats. Sigurd had two children, one of whom was a daughter, called Ragnhild, then twenty years of age, and an excellent brisk girl. Her brother Guthorm was a youth.\\"Heimskringla:Halfdan the Black Saga, chapter 5. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. The account slightly differs from the Ragnarssona þáttr when giving the age of Ragnhild at the time of Sigurd Hart's death. According to Ragnarssona þáttr, she was fifteen years old, but according to Halfdan the Black's saga, she was twenty. \\"It is related in regard to Sigurd's death that he had a custom of riding out quite alone in the uninhabited forest to hunt the wild beasts that are hurtful to man, and he was always very eager at this sport. One day he rode out into the forest as usual, and when he had ridden a long way he came out at a piece of cleared land near to Hadeland. There the berserk Hake came against him with thirty men, and they fought. Sigurd Hjort fell there, after killing twelve of Hake's men; and Hake himself lost one hand, and had three other wounds. Then Hake and his men rode to Sigurd's house, where they took his daughter Ragnhild and her brother Guthorm, and carried them, with much property and valuable articles, home to Hadeland, where Hake had many great farms. He ordered a feast to be prepared, intending to hold his wedding with Ragnhild; but the time passed on account of his wounds, which healed slowly; and the berserk Hake of Hadeland had to keep his bed, on account of his wounds, all the autumn and beginning of winter.\\"Heimskringla:Halfdan the Black Saga, chapter 5. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. \\"Now King Halfdan was in Hedemark at the Yule entertainments when he heard this news; and one morning early, when the king was dressed, he called to him Harek Gand, and told him to go over to Hadeland, and bring him Ragnhild, Sigurd Hjort's daughter. Harek got ready with a hundred men, and made his journey so that they came over the lake to Hake's house in the grey of the morning, and beset all the doors and stairs of the places where the house-servants slept. Then they broke into the sleeping-room where Hake slept, took Ragnhild, with her brother Guthorm, and all the goods that were there, and set fire to the house-servants' place, and burnt all the people in it. Then they covered over a magnificent waggon, placed Ragnhild and Guthorm in it, and drove down upon the ice. Hake got up and went after them a while; but when he came to the ice on the lake, he turned his sword-hilt to the ground and let himself fall upon the point, so that the sword went through him. He was buried under a mound on the banks of the lake.\\"Heimskringla:Halfdan the Black Saga, chapter 5. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. \\"When King Halfdan, who was very quick of sight, saw the party returning over the frozen lake, and with a covered waggon, he knew that their errand was accomplished according to his desire. Thereupon he ordered the tables to be set out, and sent people all round in the neighbourhood to invite plenty of guests; and the same day there was a good feast which was also Halfdan's marriage-feast with Ragnhild, who became a great queen. Ragnhild's mother was Thorny, a daughter of Klakharald king in Jutland, and a sister of Thrye Dannebod who was married to the Danish king, Gorm the Old, who then ruled over the Danish dominions.\\"Heimskringla:Halfdan the Black Saga, chapter 5. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. \\"Ragnhild, who was wise and intelligent, dreamt great dreams. She dreamt, for one, that she was standing out in her herb-garden, and she took a thorn out of her shift; but while she was holding the thorn in her hand it grew so that it became a great tree, one end of which struck itself down into the earth, and it became firmly rooted; and the other end of the tree raised itself so high in the air that she could scarcely see over it, and it became also wonderfully thick. The under part of the tree was red with blood, but the stem upwards was beautifully green and the branches white as snow. There were many and great limbs to the tree, some high up, others low down; and so vast were the tree's branches that they seemed to her to cover all Norway, and even much more.\\"Heimskringla:Halfdan the Black Saga, chapter 5. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. \\"Queen Ragnhild gave birth to a son, and water was poured over him, and the name of Harald given him, and he soon grew stout and remarkably handsome. As he grew up he became very expert at all feats, and showed also a good understanding. He was much beloved by his mother, but less so by his father.\\"Heimskringla:Halfdan the Black Saga, chapter 5. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. ==Historicity == According to \\"A History of the Vikings\\" (1968) by Gwyn Jones, \\"the written sources of the twelfth century and thirteenth centuries must be regarded with scepticism or downright disbelief\\" when they portray the chieftains, jarls and kings of Viking Age Norway. \\"Their world is that of tradition and folktale rather than history\\". Jones considers however that the grandparents of Harald I of Norway \\"loom closer to the frontier of history.\\" The assassination of Gudrød the Hunter by command of his wife Åsa could be estimated to c. 840. Halfdan the Black was their son.Gwyn Jones, \\"A History of the Vikings\\" (1968), page 84 The account of the assassination is given in the Ynglinga saga, also written by Snorri Sturluson. \\"They had a son by their marriage called Halfdan; and the autumn that Halfdan was a year old Gudrod went upon a round of feasts. He lay with his ship in Stiflesund, where they had been drinking hard, so that the king was very tipsy. In the evening, about dark, the king left the ship; and when he had got to the end of the gangway from the ship to the shore, a man ran against him, thrust a spear through him, and killed him. The man was instantly put to death, and in the morning when it was light the man was discovered to be Åsa's page-boy: nor did she conceal that it was done by her orders.\\"Heimskringla:The Ynglinga Saga, chapter 53. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. The saga of Halfdan the Black portrays its hero rising to the throne of Agder and Vestfold at the age of eighteen years (c. 858). \\"When he was eighteen years old he took his kingdom in Agder, and went immediately to Vestfold, where he divided that kingdom, as before related, with his brother Olaf.\\"Heimskringla:Halfdan the Black Saga, chapter 1. 1844 translation by Samuel Laing. Olaf being Olaf Geirstad-Alf, a paternal half-brother to Halfdan. Gwynn considers that accounts of how Ragnhild was married to Halfdan \\"are heavy with the accoutrement of fictional saga\\". Wedding and bedding the rescued princess the same day of meeting her follows \\"the highest tradition of the Sagas of Old Time.\\"Gwyn Jones, \\"A History of the Vikings\\" (1968), pages 85-86 The identification of Ragnhild as a niece of Thyra is considered improbable due to chronology involved. Ragnhild would be a 9th-century figure while Thyra became Queen consort of Denmark in the 10th century. Gwynn considers the saga of Halfdan the Black to be able to give some historical information but dismisses its second part, covering events from the marriage with Ragnhild to his death, as based on \\"legend, folktale, and dreams.\\" The dream of Ragnhild has a clear implication, that \\"her progeny would flourish like a great tree with blood-red roots, green trunk, and snow-white branches which would cover the whole of Norway and lands father afield.\\" Such dreams of future greatness were reported in tales concerning the parents of other conquerors. Gwyn points to a literary tradition of such \\"dreams,\\" dating at least to the surviving narratives about Cyrus the Great. Such tales would also exist about figures born later that Harald I, such as Sigurd I of Norway.Gwyn Jones, \\"A History of the Vikings\\" (1968), page 86 ==Ancestry of Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter (daughter of Sigurd Hart)== ==References== ==External links== *Page of \\"History of the Vikings\\" by Gwyn Jones covering her family Category:9th-century Norwegian people Category:Viking Age women ","title":"Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter"},{"id":"7773274","text":"Salisbury High School (founded in 1959) is a secondary public school located on Farley Grove, Salisbury North, South Australia, Australia.

Other associated titles originate from the rest of the kingdoms that formed Spain: Prince of Asturias, Prince of Girona, Duke of Montblanc, Count of Cervera and Lord of Balaguer. ==History== Originally it was the title of the heir of the Kingdom of Navarre. It was instituted by Charles III for his grandson Charles, born of the marriage between his daughter Blanche I of Navarre and John II of Aragon. The title was used also for Gaston, the son and heir of Eleanor of Navarre and Gaston IV of Foix. Its creation and use was a reflection of a Western European trend of bestowing upon the heirs of a kingdom rents for his personal benefit. In pre-unification Spain, the comparable titles were Prince of Asturias, in Castile and Prince of Girona, in Aragon. In other European states, similar titles included Dauphin, in France, Prince of Beira or Prince of Brazil, in Portugal and Prince of Wales, in England. Agustí Rigalt Cortiella, Ausias March and the prince of Viana, 1852. Due to several historical events, such as the 15th century dynastic union of Spain between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, as well as the early 16th century invasion and annexation of Navarre by Ferdinand II of Aragon, the title lost its importance. This was exacerbated when the Kingdom of Navarre ended up divided between the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain. While the title \\"Prince of Viana\\" has recently been revived, Viana itself no longer provides the heir with an income. Rather, it symbolizes the historical continuity of the former Crown of Navarre within the united Spanish monarchy. The current holder of the Principality of Viana is Princess Leonor, daughter of Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia. Leonor also uses the rest of the traditional titles of the heir of the Spanish Crown: Prince of Asturias, Prince of Girona, Duke of Montblanc and Lord of Balaguer. There are still a few people left with the royal surname of Viana, though they no longer have the Spanish Throne. ==References== ==External links== *History of the kingdom of Navarre.- The Prince of Viana in Messina * Medieval History of Navarre.- The Prince of Viana in Naples and Sicily Viana ","title":"Prince of Viana"},{"id":"7773349","text":"Rimava (Hungarian: ) is a river in southern central Slovakia, which flows only in the Rimavská Sobota District.

It ran from April 2003 and finished on September 16, 2010. On October 15, 2005 Girly became a part of the Dayfree Press collective, and on June 28, 2006, the first Girly print collection was published via Radio Comix.The Radio Comix Store ==Plot summary== The webcomic serves as a sequel to Lesnick's previous work, CuteWendy. It tells the tale of Otra, a fashion designer who feels something missing in her life until she meets Winter, the daughter of Wendy and Other Girl from CuteWendy, who declares Otra her sidekick. After a few adventures, Otra becomes attracted to Winter and the two become a couple going on adventures together. ==History== Girly launched in April 2003, originally intended as a sequel/retelling of one of Lesnick's previous works called CuteWendy, and originally was not intended to run for more than 50 strips.Mia MacHatton, Slippery, Shiny, and Definitely Sexy: Josh Lesnick, Sequential Tart vol 7 no. 3, March 2004 However, Lesnick became enamored with the characters, with the comic reaching 764 pages by its end.More than 700 strips Lesnick originally hosted Girly on KeenSpot. In November 2004, they moved Girly over to their own server, where it has remained since. On October 15, 2005, Girly became part of the Dayfree Press collective of webcomics which includes such other strips as Dinosaur Comics and Questionable Content. On August 23, 2006, Lesnick announced that fundraising efforts for the comic had been successful that they would attempt to support themself wholly via the comic. On June 28, 2006, the very first print collection of Girly strips was co-published by Radio Comix and Jackie's own company Studio Zoe, and was made available via Amazon.com and selected comic stores. On May 2, 2007, volume 2 became available. Book collections were put on hold following this volume, until after the comic ended, when, after a successful Kickstarter campaign , a limited run boxset of the complete series was made available and offered exclusively online. The final chapter was posted on September 16, 2010. ==Style== Girly's style is line-based and monochrome, using a vertical format. The original style of line drawing is akin to a manga-style but with more abstractions, giving it a sketched, freehand sort of look. The line art has evolved a great deal as time has passed, and no longer bears a great resemblance to most manga, however; recent works are somewhat reminiscent of some of John Kricfalusi's work. The art of the strip has shown a steady trend away from thin, pencil-like lines towards a much more variable, ink-brush look. After a short hiatus, on August 4, 2007, in Girly #504, the art of the strip transitioned to a much more prominent use of color. Along with absurdity, playing with stereotypes and frequent pop culture references, Girly has a strong vein of sexual humor. Various overhead shots show that Cute-Town has a skyline very similar to Dallas, Texas.Overhead view of Cute-Town resembling Dallas, Texas . In comic #398, the Alt Text to the comic said the author took the skyline of Dallas, and added smiley faces and a kitten. However, the interior of Cute-Town is said by the author to resemble Austin, Texas. ==Main characters== Girly revolves around the main characters Otra and Winter (and often the cat as well). Occasionally the story will move to a small sub-story centered around one of the secondary characters but will eventually be tied back into one of the main characters again. *Otra - Otra is the main character of Girly. She is 26 years old Girly #577: Otra's current age is given in the Alt-text. and is currently self-employed as a freelance fashion designer for the company Guapa. Not much is known about Otra (her name wasn't fully revealed until well into the comic) except that she hasn't had too hard of a life; she's just constantly disappointed/sad about mostly everything. Her main hobby is roaming through the city and observing life. Before she met Winter, she would deal with the annoying people in her life by cramming them into or tying them to small rockets and launching them into space. Winter's sudden appearance in her life has changed her a little day by day. Otra first appeared in Strip 1. Her name is Spanish for \\"other one\\" - a reference to CuteWendy's sidekick, known only as the Other Girl. *Winter - Winter is Otra's girlfriend. She is 19 years old,Girly #576: Winter gives her age. has no job or home and has declared Otra to be her sidekick early in the comic. She has since looked out for Otra devotedly, helping her with work and even occasionally saving her life as well. Not much is known about Winter except that she is the daughter of CuteWendy and her sidekick Other Girl from Girly's predecessor CuteWendy (as revealed early on). She's free-spirited, with an attitude that's both serious and yet silly. First appeared in Strip 1. *Marshmallow Kitty - A cat that was originally homeless and wandered the downtown area living off scraps and donations of food. After meeting Winter and Otra, it took a liking to them and followed Otra home. It soon became Otra's cat. Although the cat was intended to stay a secondary character or mascot, it became a primary character through its popularity. Its early appearances made it appear slightly perverted, but that has since stopped. The cat is too pudgy to roll itself over when it's on its back, and is totally indestructible. Recently it has given birth to several kittens, much to Winter and Otra's distress, and is now officially designated as female. In Strip 504 it was shown that Marshmallow Kitty was part of a scientific project to create the world's greatest cat, however this experiment resulted in the destruction of the laboratory along with everyone inside of it excluding Marshmallow Kitty. First appeared in Strip 36. ==Books== Girly previously had two volumes of books released, encompassing the first 7 chapters of the story, as well as two editions of a complete collection of its CuteWendy prequel. A complete collection of the series was published in the Summer of 2011, after being funded by Kickstarter. # CuteWendy: Collection of Perfection, 1st ed. by Keenspot Entertainment (published August 1, 2002) # CuteWendy, 2nd ed. by Studio Zoe (published July 4, 2007) # Girly Volume 1 by Studio Zoe and Radio Comix (published June 28, 2006) # Girly Volume 2 by Studio Zoe (published July 4, 2007) # Girly: The Complete Collection (published August 1, 2011) ==References== ==External links== * girly (official site) * Guapa Design (official girly online store) Category:American comedy webcomics Category:Concluded webcomics Category:Dayfree Press Category:Erotic comics Category:Fictional lesbians Category:LGBT-related webcomics Category:Romance webcomics Category:2000s webcomics Category:2010s webcomics Category:Webcomics in print Category:2003 webcomic debuts Category:Yuri (genre) comics Category:Romantic comedy comics Category:Surreal comedy Category:Kickstarter-funded publications ","title":"Girly"},{"id":"7773367","text":"Jalan Arang National Secondary School () is a public secondary school situated on Jalan Arang in Kuching, the capital of the East Malaysian state of Sarawak.

Viruttams do not possess a set tala and are solely improvised using one or more ragams. It is one of many forms of manodharma (spontaneous improvisations) in Carnatic music. A viruttam usually precedes rendition of a song. In most cases, it is sung in the same ragam as the song that follows it. Occasionally, viruttam of multiple verses are sung in different ragams, followed by a song in the same ragam as the last sung ragam of the viruttam. The artist may also sing the same verse in different ragams in different concerts. Virutham is not only used in concerts but also in traditional celebrations. Viruthams in praise of Lord Ayyappa are famous in South India.

Crosby played college baseball at Long Beach City College and was drafted by the Cardinals in the second round of the January phase of the 1969 Major League Baseball draft. He began his professional career with a rookie-league stint, as well as with the Lewiston Broncs, compiling a .295 batting average in 70 games for them. In 1970, Crosby played in 78 games for the Arkansas Travelers, where he had a .300 batting average. Part way through that season, he was promoted to the Cardinals' major league roster, where he played in 38 games primarily as a shortstop. After a year with the major league club, Crosby spent the 1971 season with the AAA Tulsa Oilers, hitting .287. His fielding ability had taken a turn for the worse at shortstop, and he tried moving to second base during the offseason. He was supported in this by Travelers manager Ken Boyer, who joined the Cardinals as first base coach. As a result, Crosby made the major league roster in 1972 and was considered one of the team's bright spots early on. He played in 101 games for the Cardinals that season, then appeared in just 22 in 1973. On July 27, he was traded along with Gene Dusan to the Cincinnati Reds for Ed Sprague, Sr. and later Roe Skidmore. Crosby spent the rest of the 1973 campaign with the Reds, then was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1973 rule 5 draft. Before playing a game for the Phillies, the Cardinals purchased his contract, and shortly afterward traded him to the Cleveland Indians with Luis Alvarado for Jack Heidemann. Crosby played in 37 games for the Indians in 1974 and 61 in 1975, finishing his major league career with two final games played in 1976 with Cleveland, having spent most of the season with the Oilers. He played three more years in the minor leagues before retiring. In a six-season MLB career, Crosby posted a .220 batting average (149-for-677) with 67 runs and 44 RBI through 297 games played. His son, Bobby Crosby, had an eight-year Major League Baseball career and was the 2004 American League Rookie of the Year. ==See also== *List of second- generation Major League Baseball players ==References== ==External links== *Baseball Library *RetroSheet Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:San Jose Missions players Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Baseball players from California Category:Lewiston Broncs players Category:Florida Instructional League Cardinals players Category:Arkansas Travelers players Category:Tulsa Oilers (baseball) players Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players Category:Wichita Aeros players Category:Spokane Indians players Category:Anaheim Angels scouts Category:Baltimore Orioles scouts Category:Chicago White Sox scouts Category:Oakland Athletics scouts Category:Long Beach City Vikings baseball players ","title":"Ed Crosby"},{"id":"7773399","text":"Pyletown is an unincorporated community in Clarke County, Virginia.

M. Natesa Sastri (1859–1906) was a noted exponent of Harikatha. He came from Tiruvarur and lived during the second half of the 19th century and the first 20 years of the 20th century. == Life == Sastri was born in a traditional Brahmin family and educated at Kumbakonam College and the Madras University. At 22, he joined the Archaeological Survey of India as an assistant to Robert Sewell. Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar was one of his prominent disciples. In 1906, he died tragically after being trampled by a horse at a temple festival in Madras. == Work == His most popular works were his collections of Tamil folk tales. He published a four-volume collection of Tamil folk tales titled The Folklore of Southern India (1884-88). He believed that folklore was national literature, and that it was \\"the most trustworthy manifestation of people's real thoughts and characteristics.\\" Sastri's collections were based on Tamil versions of the folk tales drawn from his own memory and translated to English, and addressed to non-Indian audiences. It was Richard Carnac Temple, a British folklorist in India who served as the President of the Folklore Society, who inspired Sastri's work and encouraged him to publish his first book on the tales. One review of the Folklore Society proclaimed that Sastri was the only Hindu member of the organisation. Sastri was very keen in emphasising the importance of folktales. However, despite the irrefutably native credentials of folklore, it did not ultimately become an important vehicle for nationalism in Madras, having been eclipsed by the Tamil classics of the Sangam period. Apart from his work on folk tales, Sastri published critical studies of Sanskrit literature, translations of Valmiki's Ramayana and several of Shakespeare's plays and six Tamil novels, over his twenty-five year long scholarly career. ===Novels=== *His first original Tamil novel, Dinadayalu was first published under a pseudonym in 1900. It was the story of a Brahmin man whose mother died when he was young. A revised and enlarged edition appeared in 1902. *The Rejuvenation of Komalan (1902), is a piece of bizarre comic romance in which two sisters obtain a drug which makes younger. *The Two Orphans (1902) is a moralising story covering the life of two orphaned sisters from their birth till their marriage. *A Wife Condoned (1903) is a melo-dramatic story in which a woman has an adulterous relationship with another man. The motif of women's adultery was quite new in Tamil fiction at the time. *The Mother-in-Law in Council (1903) is somewhat a historical novel combining social criticism, set in the 18th century. *Curtain Lectures (1903) is an adaptation of Douglas Jerrold's Mrs. Caudle's curtain lectures. ==References== == External links == *Works by or about Natesa Sastri at Hathi Trust Category:1859 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Tamil writers Category:Indian folklorists ","title":"Natesa Sastri"},{"id":"7773438","text":"Azhagia Nambi Pillai was a noted exponent on the mridangam and performed with several Carnatic Musicians by the end of the 19th century.

In 1964 he won first prize in the Paderewski Piano Competition; in 1973 he won an award of the Polish prime minister for his work with youth. Conducting soon became his principal career, working with symphonic orchestras, mainly the radio orchestra with which he made several recordings. From 1970 to 1972 he was on the staff of the Warsaw Grand Theatre, conducting several operas. In 1972 he formed the Polish Chamber Orchestra, which soon became a renowned group around the world.

He finished third in the Speedway World Championship in 1973 and then runner-up in 1979.Bamford, R. & Shailes, G. (2002). A History of the World Speedway Championship. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. ==Career summary== Plech won the Polish National Championship five times (1972, 1975, 1979, 1985 and 1986) and runner-up twice (1981 and 1983). He also was a member of the Poland to third place in the World Team Cup in 1972 and 1981. Zenon Plech's third place in the 1973 World Final at the Silesian Stadium in Chorzów, Poland was controversial. On the last lap of Heat 19, Soviet rider Gregory Khlynovski had attempted to pass Plech for the lead going into the back straight. As he was passed by the Russian, Plech lost control of his bike and fell. Despite protests from riders and the Soviet officials, and taking no other eyewitness account into consideration, the referee assigned to the meeting by the FIM simply took Plech's word that Khlynovski had knocked him off his bike. England's Peter Collins was awarded the heat win, Plech was awarded 2nd despite not actually finishing the race, while another Russian, Valery Gordeev, was awarded third place despite also not finishing when he crashed into Plech's fallen bike. The result of the two points he gained for second place allowed Plech to finish a clear third in the championship. The ruling, with Khlynovski excluded, should have seen Collins as the only point scorer as he was the only rider to finish, and Plech scoring no points after failing to finish. This would have resulted in Plech only finishing the championship on 10 points and in a 5th place tie with Khlynovski. Had the Russian not been excluded and had been awarded the heat win as many, including World Champions Ivan Mauger and Ole Olsen, believe should have been the case, he would have ended on 13 points. This would have put him in the run-off for the title with winner Jerzy Szczakiel (Poland) and defending champion Mauger. He rode for Hackney Hawks between 1975 and 1981 missing two seasons in 1977 and 1978 after being drafted into the Polish Army although Hackney operated \\"Zenon Plech (Rider Replacement)\\" for the entire 1977 season.

In the male, it is formed by the union of multiple testicular veins from the back of the testis and tributaries from the epididymis. ==In the male== The veins of the plexus ascend along the spermatic cord in front of the vas deferens. Below the superficial inguinal ring they unite to form three or four veins, which pass along the inguinal canal, and, entering the abdomen through the deep inguinal ring, coalesce to form two veins. These again unite to form a single vein, the testicular vein, which opens on the right side into the inferior vena cava, at an acute angle, and on the left side into the left renal vein, at a right angle. The pampiniform plexus forms the chief mass of the cord. In addition to its function in venous return from the testes, the pampiniform plexus also plays a role in the temperature regulation of the testes. It acts as a countercurrent heat exchanger, cooling blood in adjacent arteries. An abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform plexus is a medical condition called varicocele. ==In the female== In females, the pampiniform plexus drains the ovaries. The right ovary drains from the plexus to the ovarian vein and then to the inferior vena cava. However, the left ovary drains from the plexus to the left ovarian vein, and from there drains to the left renal vein before emptying into the inferior vena cava.First Aid for the USMLE Step 1, 2013. == See also == * Rete mirabile, vascular countercurrent heat- and mass-exchanging structures found in many vertebrate organs ==References== ==External links== * - \\"Inguinal Region, Scrotum and Testes: Veins\\" * - \\"Male Reproductive System: spermatic cord, pampiniform plexus\\" * - \\"Spermatic cord\\" * * () * Diagram at Rutgers Category:Veins of the torso Category:Scrotum ","title":"Pampiniform plexus"},{"id":"7773466","text":"Erste Bank a.d.

It was later used to host the Little 500 and was used in the 1979 movie Breaking Away. The stadium was demolished in 1982 and the site on which it once stood is now a green space and recreation fields in the center of campus known as The Arboretum. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1982 Category:Defunct college football venues Category:Sports venues in Indiana Category:Indiana Hoosiers football Category:1925 establishments in Indiana Category:1982 disestablishments in Indiana ","title":"Tenth Street Stadium"},{"id":"7773536","text":"Palghat T. S. Mani Iyer (1912–1981) , born Thiruvilvamalai Ramaswamy was one of the leading mridangists in the field of Carnatic music. He, along with his contemporaries Palani Subramaniam Pillai and Ramanathapuram C. S. Murugabhoopathy, are revered as the \\"Holy Trinity of Mrudangam\\". He was awarded the Madras Music Academy's Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1966. Mani Iyer was the first mridangist to win the Sangeetha Kalanidhi and Padma Bhushan awards of the Government of India. He received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1956. ==Early life and background== He was born on 12 June 1912 at Pazhayanur, then in Tiruvilvamala Taluk, in Palghat District, (now located in Thrissur District) to Sesham Bhagavatar and Aanandaambaal as their second son. Mani was named Ramaswami at birth— after his grandfather who was a school teacher besides being a good singer. Mani Iyer learnt his music from his parents in his native Pazhayyanur. His maiden public performance was at the age of 10 at a harikatha discourses by Sivaramakrishna Bhagavathar. The mridangam player who was supposed to play had failed to turn up and Mani Iyer substituted. Later he caught the eye of Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer who taught him the intricacies that invested his recitals with remarkable purity. Mani Iyer came into prominence in 1924, after accompanying Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhaagavathar in a music concert at Jagannatha Bhaktha Sabha in Madras (now called Chennai). ==Career== Mani Iyer accompanied all the leading vocal artists of his era. He was also the guru for later mridangam players such as Late Palghat R. Raghu, Late Mavelikkara Velukkutty Nair, Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, Thanjavur R.Ramadas, Kamalakar Rao, Late G. Harishankar (Kanchira),etc. Before Mani Iyer’s arrival in the music scene, the three mridangists Nagercoil S.Ganesa Iyer, Alaganambi Pillai and Dakshinamurthy Pillai (who played the kanjira also), dominated the percussion scene. The way in which Mani Iyer played changed the style of mridangam playing from just keeping beat for the main artist's music to being an instrument in its own right. A comment from Y. G. Doraisamy: \\"It was Mani Iyer who started the now prevalent trend of the mridangam, not just keeping the time with tekkas and moras, but actively accompanying the musical phrasing, so as to be a rhythmic running commentary, reproducing on the drum all the subtleties and rhythmic complexities of the musical composition.\\" Palghat R. Raghu, a disciple of Mani Iyer, describes his guru as a genius in that he showed music followers the manner of blending with the music of the main artist in handling the kritis of every conceivable mood and tempo. By his consistent excellence he could raise the concert to thrilling heights. ==Personal life== Born on 12 June 1912, in Pazhayannur village near Palghat, Mani Iyer lived a full 70 years and died on 30 May 1981.He was the father of the noted artists Mridangist T R Rajamani, vocalist Lalitha Sivakumar and violinist T.R. Rajaram. He was also the grandfather of the noted singer Nithyasree Mahadevan and Carnatic vocalist Palghat Ramprasad. ==References== ==External links== * South Indian Percussionist page * Palghat Mani Iyer website * An article in The Hindu - The Genius of Sound and Silence * Musings of a Mridangam Maestro * accompanying Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar on the Mridangam with Chowdiah on the violin.

The programming was produced in partnership with CBS as a result of the former ownership of both networks by Viacom. It debuted in June 2005, when the channel began broadcasting and was shut down on September 30, 2011. Initially, news items were presented as short segments between scheduled programs. Occasionally the channel would air full half-hour specials on stories of interest to the LGBT community, such as the Gay Games, yearly gay pride events, the October 2006 ruling in the same-sex marriage case in New Jersey, Lewis v. Harris, and the issues facing gay voters in the 2006 mid-term elections. ==History== In late 2007 CBS News on Logo went from broadcasting segments between scheduled programming to a weekly half-hour format. New programs were broadcast each Monday and repeated through the week. Jason Bellini was the lead anchor for CBS News on Logo until 2008. Other correspondents included Itay Hod and Chagmion Antoine. The Executive Producer until 2008 was Court Passant. The CBS News Up to the Minute set was utilized for the broadcast of the program. Beginning in January 2007, a news update podcast became available for download through the iTunes Store. In 2008, both Jason Bellini and Court Passant left the program. Logo changed the name to 365gay News and CBS News brought in correspondent Ross Palombo to anchor and revamp the show. On August 13, 2009, Logo announced that its partnership with CBS News had ended. 365gay News became solely an online web site.

He is known for his poetic, subdued portraits and interiors.Souren Melikian, \\"Hammershoi's decade of brilliance, before banality set in\\", International Herald Tribune, 15 August 2008. ==Life== Frederikke Hammershøi, the artist's mother (1886) Vilhelm Hammershøi was born in 1864 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The son of a well-to-do merchant, Christian Hammershøi, and his wife, Frederikke (née Rentzmann), Hammershøi studied drawing from the age of eight with Niels Christian Kierkegaard and Holger Grønvold, as well as painting with Vilhelm Kyhn, before embarking on studies with Frederik Vermehren and others at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. From 1883 to 1885, he studied with Peder Severin Krøyer at the Independent Study Schools, then debuted in the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1885 with Portrait of a Young Girl (showing his sister, Anna). Pierre-Auguste Renoir is reported to have admired this painting. Hammershøi married Ida Ilsted in 1891. ==Artistic career== Amalienborg Square, Copenhagen, 1896 Hammershøi worked mainly in his native city, painting portraits, architecture, and interiors. He also journeyed to the surrounding countryside and locations beyond, where he painted rolling hills, stands of trees, farm houses, and other landscapes. He is most celebrated for his interiors, many of which he painted in Copenhagen at Strandgade 30 (where he lived with his wife from 1898 to 1909, and Strandgade 25 (where they lived from 1913 to 1916). He travelled widely in Europe, finding London especially atmospheric in providing locations for his highly understated work, suffused as it was at the time with a foggy, coal smoke polluted atmosphere. His work in consequence has been described as \\"Monet meets the Camden School\\". Hammershøi's wife figures in many of his interiors, often depicted from behind. Ida is also the model in many similar works by her brother, Peter Ilsted. Peter and Vilhelm were lifelong friends, business partners, and colleagues. The Metropolitan Museum of Art held an exhibition of their collective works in 2001, and there was an exhibition of his works in 2008 at the Royal Academy of London. ==Technique== Interior with Young Man Reading (1898) Hammershøi's paintings are best described as muted in tone. He refrained from employing bright colours (except in his very early academic works), opting always for a limited palette consisting of greys, as well as desaturated yellows, greens, and other dark hues. His tableaux of figures turned away from the viewer project an air of slight tension and mystery, while his exteriors of grand buildings in Copenhagen and in London (he painted two exteriors of the British Museum between 1905 and 1906) are devoid of people, a quality they share with his landscapes. ==Critical acclaim== Hammershøi's early works, with their simplicity and recording of the \\"banality of everyday life\\", enjoyed critical acclaim. He was sought out by artists and literary figures of the time, among them Emil Nolde and Rainer Maria Rilke, who both remarked on his retiring manner and reluctance to talk. After a trip to Paris, his work became overly detailed. According to art critic Souren Melikian, his \\"painterly skill remained but the magic was lost.\\" Hammershøi's melancholic vision has now regained its place in the public consciousness. He is now one of the best-known artists in Scandinavia, and comprehensive retrospectives of his work have been organized by the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 2008, the Royal Academy of London hosted the first major exhibition in Britain of Hammershøi's work, Vilhelm Hammershøi: The Poetry of Silence. Hammershøi's only painting on constant display in Britain is 'Interior' in the National Gallery. In 1997, Denmark issued a postage stamp in his honour. ==BBC documentary== In 2005, Hammershøi's life and oeuvre was featured in a BBC television documentary, Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershoi, with the British comedian and writer Michael Palin. In the programme, Palin, fascinated by Hammershøi, whose pictures he conceived as having a distinct enigmatic coolness and distance about them, sets out to unlock the mysteries and find out about the background of Hammershøi. Palin, wanting to know of his inspirations and the reason for these mystical pictures, started his search in Hayward Gallery in London, goes to Amsterdam and finally to Copenhagen. ==Highest auction price for Danish work== Vilhelm Hammershøi: Ida Reading a Letter In June 2012, Hammershøi's Ida læser et brev (Ida Reading a Letter) was auctioned by Sotheby's in London for £1,721,250 or DKK 15,747,499, a record for any Danish work of art.

Hammarby IF was founded under its present name in 1897 and has been playing bandy since 1905. The club currently play in Elitserien, which is the highest division in Sweden, and has won it twice. ==History== Hammarby IF Bandy is one of the oldest bandy clubs in Sweden, founded in 1905 as a department of sports club Hammarby IF. At this time, there were several other Stockholm teams who also played bandy – AIK, IFK Stockholm, Djurgårdens IF, IF Swithiod and Djursholm. The different teams played friendly matches and local tournaments. In 1906, the Swedish Football Association took over the organization of bandy in Sweden. The Swedish championship premiered in 1907 but Hammarby IF failed to qualify for the play- offs until 1916. One year before, Hammarby had merged with Klara SK that provided a big supplement of talented players to the team. Another merge took place in 1918, when Johanneshovs IF joined Hammarby. At this time, Hammarby often played their home games at Hammarby IP in Södermalm, an area the club considers its heartland. By the end of the 1920s, Hammarby IF had established themselves among the top bandy clubs in Sweden. In the first year of bandy league system in Sweden, 1930–31, Hammarby entered in Division 1 Norra together with AIK, IF Vesta, IFK Rättvik, IK Sirius, Skutskärs IF, SK Tirfing, and Västerås SK and finished 8th. Since then, as of 2017, Hammarby has not dropped below either the highest or second highest division in Sweden. In 1957, Hammarby reached their first Swedish championship final, but lost 1–2 to Örebro SK at Stockholms stadion. Hammarby got relegated to the second division in 1979 and went on a hard struggle for several decades to come. There were even talks that the club would cease its operations. In 1995 Hammarby, however, won their promotion and returned to the top tier. During the 2000s, Hammarby has achieved much success in both domestic and international competitions. Hammarby has been crowned World Champions three times: beating Ljusdals BK 7–0 in 1999, Sandvikens AIK 2–1 in 2001 and Zorky Krasnogorsk 6–2 in 2009. They won the Swedish Cup, a knockout cup competition, for the first time in 2007, beating Sandviken in the final. They also won the cup back-to- back in 2013 and 2014. Hammarby IF won their first national championship title in 2009–10 after beating Bollnäs GoIF in the final match at Studenternas IP. They also won the gold medal in 2013, beating Sandviken, as the final for the first time was played indoors at Friends Arena.Picture before the final 2013 They have been runners-up in the seasons of 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2003–04, 2005–06 and 2006–07. The club was before the 2007–08 season in big economic problems and a campaign called \\"Rädda Hammarby Bandy\\" (save Hammarby Bandy) was set up. In the autumn of 2007 they became a joint-stock company and sold over 400 shares and they got over 2 million sek. Hammarby have strong links with fellow Stockholm-based club GT-76, with many players moving between the clubs.

Hunter was developed by Paul Holmes and Martin Walker (music), and it was released by Activision for the Amiga and Atari ST home computers in 1991. ==Gameplay== Screenshot of Hunter. The player controls a soldier in a large three-dimensional world where he can move freely by walking, swimming or using various vehicles such as cars, vans, tanks, ships, bicycles, helicopters, hovercrafts or even rowboats and surfboards. Each vehicle type has its unique properties. The game world also features a large variety of buildings, most of which can be entered and explored. Other in-game characters include enemy soldiers, civilians and animals such as seagulls, sharks and cows. The player also has a wide range of weapons ranging from a regular pistol to SAM-missiles, grenades, land mines and timed explosives. Surrounding terrain can be surveyed with aerial observation units and radar. Food and money can be used to bribe and gather information from other characters. Target coordinates can be recorded into a log book, and the player can see his position in the game world on an overlaying map. In addition to shooting, enemy soldiers can also drive vehicles and track the player down. Guard towers, tracer guns, cannons and SAM launchers have the ability to shoot towards the player, and homing missiles launched by the enemy accurately follow the player's vehicles. Birds can also flock around the player, which can cause them to get killed by a vehicle. The game is controlled mostly via joystick and mouse. The joystick controls the directional movement of the character, and the mouse is used in the selection of weapons and items. Keyboard can be used to give input and zoom the view towards or away from the character. ===Game modes=== There are three game modes to choose from. Each mode has different objectives and a its own map. * Hunter, is an action- adventure game in which communication with other characters is important. The player's mission is to track down and assassinate an enemy general and return to headquarters with his head before time runs out. The mission can be accomplished by collecting clues from civilians, bribing enemies and using various vehicles and weapons. * In Missions mode, the player has to complete a short mission and then return to headquarters in order to receive another assignment. The objectives become subsequently harder and the time shorter to complete each mission. The last mission is to destroy the enemy headquarters. * Action, is one large mission in which the player has to destroy a preset number of targets in any order he wishes. The player is given a long list of enemy targets, and it is up to him to use the map and log book to locate each target and destroy them before time runs out. ==Graphics and sound== The game world consists of a 3D polygon terrain with islands, hills and lakes. In addition to various buildings and vehicles, also some trees, plants and rocks are modeled in 3D. Use of colour is limited and shades of green, orange and blue are emphasized. The game features a 24-hour clock, and the brightness of the environment depends on the time of day. Flares can be used to illuminate the surroundings during night. The only music in the game is the main theme composed by Martin Walker, and it can be heard during the title screen on both platforms. Sound effects include engines, gunfire, explosions, waves and squawks of seagulls. Typically the Amiga is both visually and sonically more advanced, using more colours and having digitized sound effects whereas the ST version uses more dithering (re: the ocean areas) and uses synthesized sound effects. ==Development== Hunter began development in February 1990, and was originally planned for a February 1991 release date, but was delayed to August 1991. In a December 1990 issue of British gaming magazine The One, The One previewed Hunter's development. Hunter's maps are randomly generated each time the game is played, and are created using fractal geometry. After the map is generated, pre-made 3D objects are randomly placed in the game environment. Hunter is 64 kilobytes large, and has a total of 182 pre-made 3D objects. The code for Hunter's 3D environments was written by Paul Holmes, and was originally intended for a game by CRL Group before they went defunct and the game was cancelled. This code, while used as a base, was \\"substantially rewritten\\" according to The One; the code relied on the Amiga's blitter chip, but due to Hunter's planned Atari ST release, this needed to be reworked. Holmes created software that mimiced the Amiga's blitter chip that was compatible with Atari ST hardware; the program turned out to run faster than the Amiga's blitter. Holmes stated in an interview that \\"The trouble with using the hardware, is that it imposes certain limitations that then have to be overcome with clever software routines.\\" The object editor created to design Hunter's 3D objects was written in a week, and Holmes expressed that writing Hunter's game logic and enemy AI was more difficult than the game's 3D routines. Hunter's maps are generated upon 128 by 128 grids, and the game runs at an average frame rate of 12 frames per second. ==Reception== Hunter received very positive reviews (ranging from 85 to 95 points out of 100) in various game magazines. Although occasional graphical glitches and simplistic animation were noted, most of the reviewers considered Hunter one of the first serious takes on 3D gaming. The game was characterized as an innovative addition to 3D vector games and a bold step forward. What gathered most attention, however, was the scope of the game and the freedom of movement inside the game world: > [R]egardless of which mission you are on there are no restrictions, apart > from time, over how you do it. You can use whatever transport or equipment > you like. This sense of freedom allows exploration and experimentation over > transport and equipment mixes. Although the missions have time-limits there > are no constraints as to how you must complete them, and this flexibility is > severely lacking in past attempts at accessible 3D games. I loved the idea > of controlling your character with freedom to travel around the various > locations, using the various means of transport and going into buildings > without so much as a \\"by your leave\\". Although most reviewers were enthusiastic about the game world and its absorbing nature, some argued that the game world was small and could be explored in a few hours. Another aspect considered negative in the reviews was the lack of music and the quality of sound effects. Despite these minor downsides, Hunter was heralded as a believable 3D action-adventure by many reviewers. Jonathan Davies, for example, summed up his review in Amiga Power like this: :Hunter is a real all-rounder. There's something for everyone in there, all wrapped up in a believable 3D world you can get lost in for hours. The combination of the game's 3D graphics and sandbox-type gameplay has been subsequently compared to the Grand Theft Auto and similar sandbox games, such as Far Cry 2. ==References== ==External links== * Hunter at Hall of Light Amiga database * Category:1991 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Open world video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games using procedural generation ","title":"Hunter (video game)"},{"id":"7773576","text":"Robin Hood's Hut is a small pavilion in the grounds of Halswell House, Goathurst, Somerset, England.

He was a delegate to the Synod of Dort, in the Netherlands. From 1619 to 1628 he was Bishop of Chichester. ==Life== He was the son of Guy Carleton of Carleton Hall in Cumberland, born at Norham in Northumberland, where his father was warder of Norham Castle. His early education was under Bernard Gilpin, the 'Apostle of the North', at the Royal Kepier Grammar School in Houghton-le-Spring, Durham. In 1576 he was sent to St Edmund Hall, Oxford; in 1579 he took his M.A., and in 1580 was elected fellow of Merton College, Oxford. Here he won a reputation as a poet and orator, and a skilful disputant in theology, well read in the Church fathers and schoolmen. In 1589 he became vicar of Mayfield, Sussex, which he held till 1605, and in 1618 he was made bishop of Llandaff. In the same year he was selected by James I of England, with three others, to represent the church of England at the synod of Dort. Here he protested against the adoption of the thirty-first article of the Belgic Confession, which affirmed 'that the ministers of the Word of God, in what place soever settled, have the same advantage of character, the same jurisdiction and authority, in regard they are all equally ministers of Christ, the only universal Bishop and Head of the Church.' Carleton maintained the doctrine of apostolical succession in opposition to this levelling article; his protest was ineffectual. When the English deputies returned home in the spring of 1619, the Dutch States, besides paying the expenses of their voyage and presenting each with a gold medal, sent a letter to the king in which commendation is made of Carleton as the foremost man of the company and a model of learning and piety. He was translated to Chichester in the same year. He died in May 1628. Carleton was the patron of Thomas Vicars, the noted theologian, who married his step- daughter. The bishop's son, Henry Carleton, represented Arundel in the parliament of 1640, and afterwards served in the parliamentary army. ==Works== The following is an incomplete list of his works : *Heroici Characteres, Oxon. 1603, 4to. *Consensus Ecclesiae Catholicae contra Tridentinos ... 1613, 8vo. *Carmen panegyricum ad Eliz.

The story appears to be about an expedition through space to a planet inhabited by a civilized but technologically backward people, whom the expedition conquer. However, in the last line it is revealed to be anything but that. In terms of genre, the story reads like a pulp magazine yarn mixing space travel and classic swashbuckling themes, to the point where the characters even fight with swords, bringing to mind the adventures of Flash Gordon, or the Barsoom stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. ==Plot summary== An expedition from an imperialistic culture, led by a man hungry for power and riches, and accompanied by an \\"adept of the Universal Assembly\\" (a body of men apparently in communion with a higher power) arrives in a series of ships, with some difficulty -- the ships land far from their intended destination, being \\"unsuited to atmospheric navigation\\" -- and encounter the natives. Though the natives are civilized and capable of mustering armies in great number, their technology is inferior to that of the invaders. Despite being few in number, by guile and treachery the expedition is led to victory over the natives, culminating in the capture of their priest-god-king. Time goes by and the leaders consolidate their gains, only to be undone by political maneuvering from those who arrive later in the conquered lands. The leader is eventually assassinated by the sons of a defeated rival. The final line of the story reads \\"Thus died Francisco Pizarro, conqueror of Peru.\\" ==Epilogue== Far from being a pulp yarn, the story is revealed to be an account of actual history, albeit one carefully mis-told. Having pulled off his deception, the author explains at length how not one word of the story was actually untrue. Nothing was described as being anything but what it was, although it was done in such a way as to invite the reader to imagine something else. \\"Universal Assembly\\" is simply a literal translation of Ekklesia Katholikos, or the \\"Catholic Church.\\" The \\"power metal\\" which drove the Golden Empire was gold-197, because that is the only naturally occurring isotope of gold, and the \\"power\\" it brought was economic and political. The ships were never described as flying, and indeed the author did write that they \\"were not suited to atmospheric navigation\\". He protests that he had to abandon his intended last words for the leader (\\"I'm going to Heaven, and you, you bastards, can go to Hell!\\") in favor of Pizarro's actual last utterance, which was recorded as being \\"Jesus!\\" after he drew the sign of the cross in his own blood. Being published in March, the story was, in effect, an early April Fools' Day prank. It was re-published in collections of Randall Garrett's works, and an anthology entitled Analog's Lighter Side edited by Stanley Schmidt. ==External links== * * https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24091 Category:1959 short stories Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Short stories by Randall Garrett Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact ","title":"Despoilers of the Golden Empire"},{"id":"7773628","text":"Richard Epp (born 1948) is a Canadian playwright and actor.

Selecting the 16 Output Areas covering Tweedbank (east of the Tweed) on the map provided i.e. Output areas in the range S00095363-70 and S00095787-94 ==Geography== Tweedbank, as the name suggests, sits adjacent to the River Tweed, and approximately down river from Abbotsford House, the historic home of Sir Walter Scott. Tweedbank has a pond known as Gunknowe Loch, a restaurant Herges on The Loch, several shops, and a railway station. ==History== The settlement was started in the early 1970s on the land of a farm whose original house still stands (serving as a boarding cattery) adjacent to the community centre (known locally as 'The Barns'). The original settlement was built by Scottish Special Housing and included the streets of Neidpath Court, Blakehope Court, Hareshaw Bank, Stobshaw Place, Stobshaw Terrace and Haining Drive. In the 1980s Bett Housing (later to be taken over by Lema Homes) began building on the site at the entry of Tweedbank from Galashiels; this estate included the streets Abbotslea, Riverside Drive, Abbotsferry Road, Lowood Park, Ladymoss and Heathery Rigg. To locals this area was often known as 'the Betts'. The 1990s saw two developments by Eildon Housing Association, namely Jura Drive and Craw Wood, with private housing being built around Tweedbank View and Tweedbank Drive. The final development in the 2000s was constructed by Barratt Homes in the area around Weavers Linn, built on the former Abbotsford to Lowood road (later a footpath). Before the advent of the new town of Tweedbank, the area was occupied by the farms of Tweedbank and Bridgend Mains .Ordnance Survey map 6 in. to 1 mile: Selkirkshire Sheet VIII.NW & NE, Surveyed: 1897, Published: 1900 The new housing estate lies in the civil parish of Melrose in the former county of Roxburghshire.Canmore website entry for Tweedbank: canmore.org.uk/site/86457 - website of the archeological inventory of Historic Environment Scotland ==Education, sport and landmarks== The original primary school near the loch was a small school of fewer than 100 pupils and composite classes. In 1996 this changed, due to a slightly increasing population, and the school was now able to teach students in separate classrooms organised by their year of schooling. In the early 2000s the school expanded due to a significant increase in the local population. In addition to residential housing and the Primary School, Tweedbank also boasts an all weather sports complex, an Astroturf football and hockey pitch, an indoor bowling club, a large children's all-weather play area, and the Gun Knowe Loch, which is actually a man-made lake. The loch is popular with locals due to its abundance of swans and ducks. Amenities located next to the Gun Knowe Loch include a local shop, a hairdressers, and the bar/restaurant Hergés on the Loch, which has outdoor seating available in the summer. Government offices for Agriculture & Fisheries and the Scottish Public Pensions Agency can also be found within Tweedbank. Tweedbank is the site of the biggest industrial estate in the region and of Radio Borders HQ. ==Culture== Each year in May, the village celebrates a week-long 'Tweedbank Fair' in which a local 'Tweedbank Lad and Lass' (together with two attendants each) are appointed from members of the school's Primary Seven class. ==Transport== Class 158 DMU at Tweedbank railway station The village is served by Tweedbank railway station, the terminus of the Borders Railway that runs between the Central Borders and Edinburgh. Trains run half-hourly on weekdays, and hourly in evenings and at weekends. Tweedbank Drive is the main thoroughfare through the village, leading from Galashiels towards Melrose, with a number of roads adjoining. Driving eastwards, on the left adjacent firstly is Abbotsferry Road. The next turn off is on the right-hand side, Weavers Linn leading to The Beeches.

From its opening in 1922 until 1967 it was the home field of the Kansas State Wildcats football team, prior to the opening of Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium. It was also used by Kansas State University for track and field. ==Stadium history== The stadium was built and named in tribute to Kansas State students who died in World War I. The west stands were built in 1922, and the stands on the east side of the stadium were completed two years later. Its general seating capacity was 17,500 people when completed, although attendance sometimes exceeded 20,000. The stadium was built at the location of Ahearn Field, and as late as 1938 the field was still known as Ahearn Field at Memorial Stadium. The original plans for the stadium included an enclosed bowl, but the final phase of the stadium was never built. In 2015–16, both sides of the stadium were renovated, with much of the seating bowl converted to gardens. The stadium was officially re- dedicated as \\"World War I Memorial Stadium\\" on April 21, 2017. ==Football history== Memorial Stadium, 1924 The first game held at the stadium was on October 6, 1922, when only the west wing of the stadium was complete. Kansas State defeated Washburn University in that initial contest 47–0. The east wing of the stadium opened for the 1924 season. Four years later in 1928, a two- story wooden press-box was added to the east wing. The upper level was for press, while the lower level featured boxes for distinguished alumni and guests. A pre-World War II record crowd of 17,545 attended the Wildcats' game against #6 Oklahoma on November 11, 1939. Kansas State lost the game 13–10. After the war there were a handful of games where attendance exceeded 20,000, including a crowd of 23,822 to watch #18 Kansas State play #9 Oklahoma in 1953. The first night college football game at Memorial Stadium was played on September 20, 1947. Oklahoma A&M; defeated Kansas State by a score of 12–0. ==Stadium today== Exterior of stadium, 2017 ===Athletic events=== The stadium is still used for athletics.

He improved the Illini defense from 91st in the country in 2009, to 38th in 2010, and 7th in 2011. Illinois gave up just 291.8 yards per game and ranked fourth in the nation in pass defense, fifth in tackles for loss and ninth in sacks.

In five of those games, North Carolina held its opponents to less than 20 points, including the 39–17 win over Cincinnati in the Belk Bowl. For the entire 2013 season, North Carolina allowed 24.3 points per game, which gave them the 48th-ranked scoring defense.

After retirement from the stage, he remained an iconic figure in Carnatic music as a dedicated teacher and leader in the Carnatic community. His bhava-laden renditions of Carnatic songs have become the measuring stick for generations of Carnatic vocalists. Musiri Subramania Iyer is one of the giants of Carnatic music in this century. ==Biographical sketch== Musiri Subramania Iyer, as he was universally known, was born in Bommalapalayam in the Trichy district of Tamil Nadu. His father, Sankara Sastry was a Sanskrit pandit. One of three siblings, he lost his mother, Seethalakshmi, as a boy and his sister Rajathi passed when she was but a child. His family was poor—in later life Musiri seldom spoke about those early years. He married Nagalakshmi when he was 14 years old. Musiri Subramania Iyer learned to fluently speak, read and write in English when he was 17. Inspired by the singing of a popular acting star of those days, S. G. Kittappa, he decided to become a musician. Like Kittappa, Musiri had a strong vocal range in the higher octaves, and could imitate the former's hit songs with ease. Musiri Subramania Iyer's initial training in music was under S. Narayanaswamy Iyer for two years, before moving to Chennai for more serious studies with violinist Karur Chinnaswami Iyer. Due to a lack of time to devote to teaching, Chinnaswami sent him to become the disciple of renowned vocal teacher T.S. Sabhesa Iyer who lived in Purasawalkam. Musiri Subramania Iyer trained with him for 9 years in the guru shishya parampara, learning his guru's particular way of performing neraval that Musiri Subramania Iyer would later become famous for. He made his debut in Chennai in 1920. His name was announced as \\"Subramania Iyer of Musiri\\" and the name stuck. (As per tradition in India, the town the artist hails from is sometimes added as a prefix to ones name, honoring the town while simultaneously giving a distinction of a specific geographical nature to the artist, such as Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, etc.) Given that Musiri was not born in Musiri, accounts differ as to why the name Musiri was added to his name. Musiri once stated that it was simply because Musiri was a more well known location than Musiri's home town of Bommalapalayam, and easier to say as a prefix. Whatever the case, Musiri Subramania Iyer was a prolific and expert performer, and within 10 years his reputation as a master musician across India was sealed. In his career, the popularity of Musiri and his name reached every corner of India. His 78 rpm gramophone records were successful to the point that the audience would sometimes demand he sing songs in the exact way as heard on the record. Beginning with the krithi Nagumomu, everything Musiri recorded were best sellers. Nagumomu was a song that, previous to Musiri, was only sung in the Abheri raga, as India's Trinity composer Tyagaraja is thought to have composed it in Abheri. However, Musiri Subramania Iyer felt that the song sounded more emotional in the Karnataka Devagandhari raga, (a similar but subtly different raga) and he sang and recorded Nagumomu with Karnataka Devagandhari. Carnatic music is an exacting music that places large importance on tradition. Therefore, Musiri Subramania Iyer's rendition of the song in a different raga than it was originally written caused outrage in many Carnatic musical purists. But Musiri stuck to his decision. Given that Musiri was a devotee of Tyagaraja, taking liberty with Tyagaraja's song was out of freedom of spontaneous expression and not out of irreverence. As a point of fact, Nagumomu sounded so suited to Karnataka Devagandhari raga that everyone began to perform it in the \\"Musiri Subramania Iyer way\\", artists such as Bangalore Nagarathnamma, M. S. Subbulakshmi, and Bhanumathi Ramakrishna. Other songs that became popular and became recognizable through Musuri's signature touch were Enta vetukondu in Saraswathi Manohari raga, Enthu daginado in todi raga, Tiruvadi caranam in Kambhoji, Enraikki shiva kripai in Mukhari, and Vritta shenjadai ada, a ragamala. Musiri Subramania Iyer acted in the role of Sant Tukaram in the eponymous film. Though the film is out of print, Musiri Subramania Iyer 's songs in the film have stood the test of time. Musiri Subramania Iyer did not like acting in the film, citing that acting with women, make up and bright lights made him uncomfortable. Musiri Subramania Iyer 's guru also warned him against acting in the film, knowing that Musiri Subramania Iyer had struggled with lung illness in the past, and the damp climate in Coimbatore might affect his health. For financial reasons, Musiri accepted the acting part. The exertions he underwent during the making of the film is thought to have resulted in lifelong lung trouble for Musiri Subramania Iyer, forcing his early retirement from live performance in 1945 at 46 years of age. Though retired from the concert circuit, Musiri Subramania Iyer was active in many Carnatic music affairs throughout India. He was appointed as the first principal of the Central College of Carnatic Music, Chennai in 1949. During his tenure, he influenced a whole generation of musicians, retiring in 1965. He was also the Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of Sri Tyagaraja Brahma Mahotsava Sabha, and was responsible for organizing the annual aradhana of Tyagaraja's passing, at his samādhi in Thiruvaiyaru. The annual celebration of Tyagaraja's music is the largest musical gathering in India, and continues to this day. Musiri Subramania Iyer is also credited for his key role in the unification of various factions associated with the Aradhana. ==Place in Carnatic music== Renowned for his high pitched voice and tonal purity (known in Carnatic music as sruti), Musiri Subramania Iyer was considered a great exponent of bhava, bringing out the full emotional content of each krithi that he sang. His patanthara of several krithis has his special stamp, which can be easily recognized when they are rendered by his disciples. He was a specialist in neraval singing and also vilamba sangitham, a slower tempo song designed to exude tranquility and bring out the full emotional content of the ragas and krithis that he rendered. Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, who was a contemporary of Musiri Subramania Iyer, said \\"Musiri Subramania Iyer brought gauravam (dignity) to our profession.\\" He also heralded Musiri's dedication to bhava by saying \\"He used to be so lost in bhava that he never thought of evoking any response.\\" In the All India Radio archives catalog, this introduction was written: \\"Vocalist of mesmerizing melodies Musiri Subramania Iyer, was the repository of pathos, piety and poignancy. He was more at home in the pristine heights of upper octave than at any other. The enlightened and the lay had always rushed to the concert hall to hear the soulful melody of Musiri Subramania Iyer which had become the subject to talk in innumerable households. His audience got soaked in emotions and feelings that were at once human and divine.\\" Musiri Subramania Iyer was not only a respected musician but also a sought-after teacher. His special contribution is the number of disciples he trained in his own home, all of whom have attained distinction in their own right. In fact his shishya parampara is so well recognized, his style of rendering krithis has come to be known as the Musiri School. Well known disciples include N. Rajam Musiri M.R.Gopala Rathnam, T. K. Govinda Rao, Bombay Sisters C. Saroja & C. Lalitha, Thylamba Krishnan, Mani Krishnaswamy, K. S. Venkataraman, Suguna Purushothaman and Suguna Varadachari. The Musiri Subramania Iyer Bani is carried out to the next generation by these great Vidwans and Vidushis. Some of the students under Musiri Subramania Iyer Bani are Vocalists Kum K. Gayatri, Kum. Vidya Kalyanaraman, Sri. Prasanna Venkatraman, Jayam Venkateshwaran and others. ==Awards== Before the Sangeetha Kalanidhi award existed, the highest honor possible in 1939 was to be invited as the President of the Annual Conference by the Madras Music Academy. Musiri Subramania Iyer was invited to be President of the Annual Conference that year, and was awarded the Sangeetha Kalanidhi by the Music Academy of Chennai as soon as the award came into being in 1942. Musiri Subramania Iyer was only 39 when he received it, a record that was bested by Semmangudi who received the award at the age of 38 in 1947. In 1963 he was awarded the Isai Perarignar from the Tamizh Isai Sangam. The Indian Fine Arts gave him the Sangita Kala Shikhamani in 1966. In 1967, he was made a Fellow of the Sangit Natak Academy. The President honored him with the Padma Bhushan in 1971. Roads have been named after him in Tamil Nadu, and national postage stamps have been issued bearing his portrait in 1999. ==References== ==Further reading== *V. Sriram.

The 3-in-1 kit was first issued about 1965 and has been reissued several times since. Aluminum Model Toys, commonly abbreviated as AMT, was a Troy, Michigan-based company that manufactured various pre-assembled plastic promotional models starting in 1948, when attorney West Gallogly, Sr. started it as a side business. Later, a variety of kits became very popular. Most of the company's vehicle products were American cars and trucks in 1:25 scale. In the 1970s, hot rods, customs, trucks and movie and TV vehicles were also produced, with their association with Star Trek a particular stand out. ==Startup== Because Gallogly had solid connections with Ford Motor Company, he was able to place his first models exclusively in Ford dealerships, starting a long promotional relationship (Cawthon 2002). Gallogly's first model was a 1947–1948 Ford Fordor sedan made of cast aluminum and painted with official Ford paint (Cawthon 2002). After issuing successful Ford sedan models, the company set up shop on Eight Mile Road outside Detroit (Chrysler 2008). In 1949, injection plastic molding became available. After the first Ford aluminum promotional model was offered (Doty 2008, 89), aluminum was abandoned. Different colors of plastic could now be used, so the company name was quietly changed to AMT, which deemphasized the word \\"aluminum\\" (Cawthon 2002). For example, AMT's 1949 and 1950 Ford and Plymouth sedans were its first plastic models, along with the 1950 Studebaker coupe. These promos often had wind-up motors which could not be seen through the shiny silver-tinted windows. They had metal chassis and diecast metal chrome-plated bumpers, which were later replaced with chrome-plated plastic. Often, official factory paint colors were applied to the models. The company's first commercial products were pre-assembled plastic promotional models, which were only available through automobile dealerships, In the early 1950s day-to- day operations of the company were turned over to George Toteff so that Gallogly could better attend to his law firm (Cawthon 2002). Model design was kept in-house, but molding was outsourced. Continental Plastics in Fraser, Michigan, was one of the companies contracted to mold AMT's models (Cawthon 2002). ==Early competitors== AMT was the most successful company in the mid-1950s to mold accurate plastic models in 1:25 scale and sell them to auto manufacturer dealerships, but it was not the first promotional automobile model maker. AMT 1959 Mercury 3-in-1 kit. Design, logo, wording and 3-in-1 concept were identical to the SMP brand. National Products of Chicago, Illinois, starting manufacturing pot metal promotional models in the 1930s. Among their earliest models were the 1934 Studebaker, DeSoto and Chrysler Airflows, Graham and Hupmobile four-door sedans and a variety of other cars and trucks. National Products was purchased by Banthrico in 1949. Banthrico started making promotional banks of animals and buildings in the 1930s. After World War II, Banthrico continued with a focus on precision metal replica banks of cars, accurately painted, and mostly in 1:25 scale. According to promo aficionado Clarence Young (accessed 2010), these car models were used to display factory car colors to prospective buyers. Through the early 1950s Banthrico was the leader in metal promotional models. Nevertheless, the use of plastic was on the rise and would become dominant by the mid-1950s. At this time, AMT and its competitors began making plastic promotional models. These companies were Scale Model Products (SMP), Product Miniature Company (PMC), National Products and Ideal Models, which later became Jo-Han because of the name conflict with the Ideal Toy Company. PMC may have been the first to actually produce a model in plastic, but Banthrico, PMC, and others faded while AMT and Jo-Han gained momentum on the promo scene. Among these companies, SMP of Birmingham, Michigan, is the most significant to AMT. About 1958, SMP started what was to become the plastic modeling craze by introducing the “annual” kit, often with a 3-in-1 theme where the model could be built in stock, custom, or racing versions. Aluminum Model Toys bought SMP in 1961, adopting SMP's 3-in-1 kit idea and the SMP logo, which at the time was a diamond shape (Doty 2007, 86). AMT also adopted some of the SMP kit features when making promotional models. For example the 1959 Imperial came with a detailed chassis and glued-in axle mounts (Doty 1999c, 88). Also, the universally recognizable red rectangle with rounded corners shifted from SMP to AMT with a simple change of the diagonally-formed white letters. Thus, SMP seems to have created the 3-in-1 annual kit and logo, not AMT. AMT then marketed both the SMP and AMT names simultaneously for a couple of years. On promo boxes, the diagonal SMP logo was copied by AMT but that style did not last. ==Era of promotionals== AMT then, through the early 1960s, ruled supreme in the promotional (and kit) market rivaled only by Jo-Han. It is important to compare AMT marketing with that of other plastic model makers. Newcomer MPC (Model Products Corporation) entered the arena in 1964 with their Chevrolet Corvette kit, followed by 1965 promotionals of the Dodge car line. Plastic model makers like Pyro Plastics Corporation and Premier Products came and went, while other kit makers focused on different vehicles. Lindberg rarely touched the promo market. Monogram focused on custom, hot rod, TV, movie, racing cars, aircraft, and ships. Revell did U.S. vehicles, but focused on European Sports and racing cars. Aurora Plastics Corporation diversified, specializing in aircraft, TV, classic Universal Monsters & figure kits. Aurora also made a large range of 1:32 scale and several 1:25 scale car kits. Palmer Plastics sold a number of American 1:32 scale car models for 98 cents each throughout the 1960s, but these models were poorly detailed and lacked basic features such as clear windows and correct wheel covers. Importantly, through the 1950s post World War II, plastic gradually became the primary material for the modeling and collecting hobby in the United States. The post-war labor and business environment in the U.S. supported only the simpler casting of cheaper materials for toys, although they could be made with great detail. By contrast the common trend in Europe was making more sophisticated diecast metal zamac toys in smaller sizes with many working features. These were more complex products for a labor structure driven by a densely populated European craft guild environment. Such characteristics were not as prevalent in the United States. === Promotional development === Promotional makers like AMT worked very closely with styling departments of American automobile manufacturers (Anderson 2003). One fascinating article appearing in Ford Times (1961) chronicled the manufacturing process of AMT models. Intricate drawings and styling models, just like with the real thing, were first constructed. Larger 1:10 or 1:12 scale clay models would be crafted to perfect details. Accurate dies in 1:25 scale, which was the most common, would be made from these for plastic injection. Bumpers and hood ornaments were chrome-plated and bodies were painted, often in factory colors. Painted bodies were baked in ovens, then the models were assembled and packaged. Often the actual auto manufacturers would pay the cost of tooling. Such costs could range anywhere from $20,000 to $250,000 (Automotive News 1948; Donneley 2009;Ford Times 1961). The model companies were often pressed to get sales, display, paint and promotional details correct in order to offer the models to the “Big Three” before the real vehicles hit the market. Detroit's annual model changes required last minute alterations in model details and showroom displays had to be finished in advance of the actual cars reaching the dealerships (Anderson 2003). One example was AMT’s 1968 Chevy hardtop kit. AMT did not have access to GM’s 1968 details, so the resulting model was not correct (Doty 2000a, p. 88). Another example was the 1960 Ford Falcon promo that was offered in a hardtop, which was not available on the actual car (Doty 2002a, p. 88). Limitations of models offered also sometimes had interesting results. The 1966 Mercury Comet promo came only in a hardtop and that year a convertible paced the Indianapolis 500, so the 500 promo came in any style desired as long as it was a hardtop (Doty 2001, p. 89). Models were sometimes used in dealerships as display materials that were not generally sold. They were also used to promote sales to customers (Anderson 2003). Models would be used to show prospective customers what new models would look like. Of course, they could also be purchased at the parts counter for around one dollar. Commonly, especially in the 1950s, they were simply given away in the showroom after a test drive, usually to children (Ostrander 2011; Gibson 1970 pp. 44–45). For example, a 1958 Edsel ad prompted \\"Road Check The Big One, Get A Little One Free\\" (Feder 1990; see also Clarence Young Autohobby museum). === Promotional details === 1959 Edsel Corsair with warped body panels which were made out of cellulose acetate. Styrene bumpers did not warp. Though simply cast, promotional models were exquisitely detailed and proportioned, and by 1960, AMT became the main supplier of the pre-assembled model to American car companies. AMT worked most closely with Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation, but promo contracts among the model manufacturers seemed to alternate year to year (See Doty 2009a for a nice history of AMT's Ford Galaxie). Shapes of the vehicles were near perfect, though in the 1950s, cellulose acetate, the plastic of choice, was prone to serious warping. In 1960, AMT and some other manufacturers switched to styrene (the brand name being Cycolac, which is actually ABS or alpha butadiene styrene – or rubbery styrene, more flexible and less brittle) and by 1964, all of the major model car manufacturers had changed over to the new plastic. This solved the problem and styrene models 50 years later still maintain their form. 1961 was a key year for the switchover. For example some early 1961 Mercury Monterey two door promos were done in acetate while most for that year were done in the new non-warping Cycolac (Doty 2000b, p. 89). Models were molded in different colors, but often painted with actual factory paints, a practice that went back to the 1930s. Also, as with the 1964 Pontiac Grand Prix, the roof was cast in \\"vinyl\\" black. Script and emblem details were intricately molded into plastic bodies, grilles and wheels. Hoods did not open, there was no engine detail and no interiors on most models in the 1950s. Thus promos without interior or engine detail were called “coaster models” as opposed to kits with more detail. With the development of kits, however, viewing the interior became practical and as important as exterior appearance. Speedometer numbers could be read on the instrument panels. Horn rings on the steering wheels were accurately depicted brand by brand. 1962 Ford Galaxie chassis detail with promotional slogans and specifications Early on, AMT chassis were often made of metal, but later, they were usually a single piece of plastic with lower engine, exhaust and suspension details molded in a single piece with metal axles fitted through holes in the sides of the plastic. Normally, on the chassis, there were no operating suspension parts. Wheels were one-piece plastic pressed onto the axles. With parts typically \\"melted\\" together, forming a permanent bond, promotional models were much more durable than their counterpart assembled kits. Of course, promotionals were simpler and had fewer parts than kits which were a later marketing ploy to enhance sales. Hoods did not normally open and suspension details were molded into the chassis. One exception to this was the 1962 Ford Fairlane promo which had an opening hood and a detailed engine (Doty 1999a, pp. 88–89). Beyond this, extras were not often built in, but there were occasional surprises like the button on the 1959 \\"Wide Track\\" Pontiacs which pushed the wheels inward toward the body to simulate how wide the new cars were (Doty 1999b, p. 87). Seats were often, but not always, part of the single bucket of the interior whereas they were usually separate parts in kits. Many promotional models have survived intact for decades, whereas assembled kits tend to fall apart as the plastic cement deteriorates and small parts fall off, unless they were \\"solvent welded\\" with acetone or some other specific solvent for ABS. What was really fun was, AMT's common molding of sales specifications into the chassis, especially on Ford cars. The promo 1962 Ford Galaxie, for example, had thirteen different phrases molded on the chassis, from the very factual \\"Vacation Volume Trunk-28 Cubic Feet\\" to the more fanstastical \\"Galaxie, Silent As A Secret\\" or \\"Enduring Elegance With The Power To Please”. Beginning collectors may try to simply identify a year of a promo from its license plate, but not all promos followed this tradition. 1970 and 1971 Thunderbirds had no year-stamped license plates, so telling them apart can be difficult (Doty 1999c, p. 89). === Frictions and Radios === Commercial versions of AMT promos were marketed in retail toy and dime stores like Zayre and Murphy. A few, in the mid-1950s, like the 1954 Buick Roadmaster, 1954 Ford Customline sedan or the 1955 Sunliner, were also offered in remote control versions (Doty 2003, p.88; Doty 2004a, pp. 86–87). In the 1960s they were commonly sold for $1.00. Jo-Han also offered friction models at that time. Differences of retail friction models from the dealer promos were the lack of manufacturing paint schemes (they were simply molded in different colors, like many other promotionals) and usually had the addition of a friction motor located on the front axle, noticeable by the studded white vinyl gear that protruded around the axle (and through the oil pan)(see Gibson, p. 45). By contrast, the promo version often had a special lower engine plate that covered where the friction motor was placed on the commercial model. Early on, some cars, such as the 1953 Studebaker Commander promo, had the addition of acetate windows, while the friction powered model was windowless (Doty 2000b, p. 88). As collectibles today, the friction powered models are worth somewhat less than official promos, but the quaintness of the frictions makes them equally appealing. Nevertheless, not all models offered as promotionals were also made as commercial frictions, like the 1964 Comet Caliente which came as a dealer promo only. Conversely, some dealer promotionals like the 1961 Falcons, did come with friction motors but were painted in dealer colors (Doty 2002a, p 88). Like promotionals, friction car models are extremely durable, using the same basic plastic components as the promos. Slightly different were unassembled versions of the promo cars, like the AMT 1971 Ford Torino. These were typically simpler and easier to assemble than the full blown kits. In fact, before the 3-in-1 kits discussed below, promos were offered as kits without all the extra custom and hot rod parts (Doty 2004b, p. 88). These were sometimes molded in color instead of the traditional white for the kits and easily assembled without glue. Some cars were only manufactured as frictions or kits, but not promotional models. One example is the 1968 Ford XL Fastback, which was available only in bright yellow as a friction, or as an annual kit molded in the standard white color. However, the 1967 and 1969 XL were available as promos. Other cars were available as frictions and promos, but not kits. An example of this is the 1963 Ford Galaxie 500/XL \\"boxtop\\" square-roof hardtop. Some versions were only available in some forms as hardtops, others as convertibles. Also, some models were made with built-in radios, like the 1964–1968 Ford Thunderbirds, 1964 and 1966 Riviera, 1965 Dynamic 88 and 1966 Impala SS. These generally do not hold as much value as promos or frictions (Doty 1999c, p. 88). === Decline of promotionals === Gradually, perhaps since the mid-1960s, the importance of promotionals began to dwindle. AMT produced their last dealer promos for the 1972 model year and by the late 1970s, plastic promos were mostly a thing of the past (Anderson 2003). AMT, along with MPC and Jo-Han, continued to produce promotionals until the 1980s, but it was not the enterprise it once was. Eventually models were offered only for the most sporty or prestigious cars and sold in dealerships for steep prices and not given away, so the term “promotional” hardly applied any longer. Also, the auto companies, which earlier had seen promotional models as easy and free advertising, began to charge fees to modeling companies in the late 1980s for the use of their names and designs (Clor 1990). Thus smaller companies had a more difficult time affording manufacturing licensing. Models began to appear in dealerships in metal by Ertl, Brookfield, and even Maisto, and in scales other than 1:25. Through the 1990s, AMT/Ertl continued some plastic promotionals in the traditional fashion, though metallic flake molded into the plastics was a new twist. These models were now made in China and were mainly Corvettes and Vipers. Plastic promotionals still exist, like the AMT/Ertl 2008 Dodge Challenger, but it costs at least $25.00. ==Era of kits== AMT 3 in 1 1957 Thunderbird kit instructions. Notice the distinction made between “customizing” and “stylizing”. It is important to remember that in the 1950s promotional models came first, followed by kit development. Jim Donnelly, of Hemmings Classic Car wrote, \\"...once companies realized that built up promos were already licensed, they could be reintroduced as assembly kits\\" (Donnelly 2009). Like most plastic model kits, AMT’s parts were molded onto \\"trees\\" and could be separated easily for assembly. Kits of cars in stock form were soon augmented with parts to build custom and hot rod versions. Thus, the annual promotional model was also offered in kit form as an extra sales benefit. As mentioned above, this configuration was soon named the “3-in-1” kit where the modeler could build a car in stock, custom, or hot rod versions by selecting different parts included in the box. Some of AMT's first successful kits were of 1932 and other early Fords. These were reissued several times over the years (Doty 2009b,87). Unlike promotional models which had sealed hoods, no engine detail and basic suspension detail molded into the chassis, kits usually had opening hoods, full engine detail, complete interiors and detailed multi-part suspensions. Earlier kits had less chassis detail and featured promo-like interiors, metal axles, whitewall tires and screws to attach the body to the chassis. Later kits often had more detail but metal parts such as axles, screws and hood clips were either deleted or made of plastic instead. Miniature whitewall tires, which were once a regular feature of kits, became outdated and modern blackwall tires took their place as they did on actual cars. Ala Kart Sometimes the same box design was used to package different kits. For example, the 1961 Pickup kit box illustrated both the Ford and the Chevy, but the kit inside the box was identified by a label affixed to the outside. In the early 1960s, AMT's 3-in-1 Trophy kit instructions usually came with short biographies of popular customizers of the day such as Bill Cushenberry, Dean Jeffries, Alex Kraus, Gene Winfield, Alexander Bros. from Detroit , and George Barris, most of whom were employed by AMT. Winfield even closed his California shop to work with AMT (Cawthon 2002). Also, instruction sheets for some kits had a section with customizing hints by Barris exclusively. An extreme example was the 1957 Ford Thunderbird kit. The instructions included five pages devoted to “stylizing”, a practice of adding parts by using body putty and sanding which went beyond ordinary customizing. Included in the kit were additional street rod, drag racing, and land speed racing styling ideas, all suggested by Barris. By 1965 AMT and other kit manufacturers had made significant changes to their product lines. Although dealer-oriented promotionals were their lead business, by the mid-1960s most manufacturers developed a whole new market by tapping into customizing and customizers. These were often linked to TV and movie themes which now drove AMT and other model companies. AMT offered some foreign car kits, but usually only if they were associated with U.S. car companies or a film favorite. An example was the 1971 Opel GT, a General Motors product made in Germany. Foreign car kits were left to other manufacturers such as Monogram or Revell. Custom TV and movie cars, often designed by Barris, like the ZZR (from the 1966 beach movie Out Of Sight)or the Monkeemobile, were also popular. By the early to mid-1960s, modeling had exploded in popularity and kit sales easily overcame that of promotionals. Model Products Corporation, known as MPC, entered the promotional and kit scene in 1965 and by 1970 was just as popular as AMT. To fight back, AMT started offering kits for an even wider variety of machines and themes. ==Restoration and resin== Today, because of the high value of old promotional, friction and annual kit cars in 1:25 scale, a “cottage industry” boom has taken place. Parts for these valuable old cars are being cast in high-quality resin and sold online by such vendors as The Modelhaus, R & R Resin and Star Models. A skilled modeler can now restore a broken promo that was played with as a toy decades ago to like-new condition. Such parts as hood ornaments, wheels, tires, and even windshield frames from delicate convertibles are available. Parts that were originally chrome-plated are available pre-chromed for easy restoration. In addition to parts, complete resin kits in the original 1:25 scale are also available. These are typically reproductions of original promos and include many of the features of the original kit including whitewall tires, metal axles and hoods molded into the body. A good example of a reproduction kit in resin is the 1960 Edsel hardtop. Some offerings are models that were never available when the kits were first issued. For example, Modelhaus offers a 1:25 scale resin model of the 1973 Chevrolet Caprice Estate Wagon, based on the original Caprice hardtop promo. These new issues typically sell at rather high prices, often $50 to $100 each. ==Trucks== In the 1960s, competition forced diversification and AMT added new product lines, specifically trucks. For example, its early Dirt Hauler kit was merely a generic tractor-trailer with dumping trailer. Then, in 1969, AMT released the California Hauler 359 kit. This new kit was a revolution for model building, a realistic model of a Peterbilt 359 tractor-trailer, the design having been copied from the manufacturer's specifications. It also had an authentic 8V71 Detroit Diesel engine under the hood. The kit lacked a sleeper cab, but there was a coupon that could be sent in along with ten cents to get it. The following year, the second version was issued with a sleeper cab. Due to the success of the California Hauler 359, AMT proceeded to issue more truck kits through the 1970s. Examples of offerings were the Chevrolet Titan/GMC Astro, Peterbilt 352, Kenworth W925, Autocar A64B and White Road Boss. Trailer kits to accompany these trucks, such as box, flatbeds, refrigerated and tankers were introduced. These kits tended to cost about $5. When the TV series Movin' On debuted in 1974, AMT made new versions of many of their truck kits with new features such as CB radios, dragfoilers and sometimes new engines. For example the Peterbilt 359 kit was given a Cummins NTC-350 diesel engine, a larger-windowed 1100 series cab (as opposed to the small-windowed Unilite cab) and a larger bumper in addition to the previously mentioned CB radio and dragfoiler. When Ertl bought AMT in 1983 (forming AMT- Ertl), many of AMT's old truck kits were reissued, but completely new models were rare except for the Kenworth T600A (1991). In addition, some of Ertl's plastic model truck kits were reissued under the AMT-Ertl brand. Many of the old AMT truck kits can be found on auction sites like eBay, often commanding fairly high prices. == Star Trek and other science fiction== In July 1966 previews began to air for Star Trek, which were seen by executives at AMT. They sought a contract to produce model kits based on the starships and other props seen in the series. A contract was signed between AMT and Desilu on August 1, 1966, stipulating that kits based on the Enterprise could be made in exchange for AMT providing a 3/4 scale exterior of a Galileo shuttlecraft and an interior filming set (Cushman p. 304). The prop measured long and tall. It was built by Gene Winfield, a specialty car designer working for AMT, (Cushman p. 304) from blueprints created by Thomas Kellogg. (Cushman p.307)(Thomas The Shuttlecraft Galileo - Part 1) Around 1966 AMT obtained the plastic model rights to Star Trek and developed a model kit of the Starship Enterprise, beginning a long association between AMT, science fiction and television. AMT's 1966 Enterprise model is one of the company's highest-selling kits (Kelly 2008, p.169). The original model of the Enterprise was equipped with battery-operated lights, but even after the lights were deleted, a number of features from the lighted model persisted in the kit, including a removable main deflector assembly which had covered the battery compartment and served as an on-off switch for the lighted model. There were also little indentations in the saucer section where the light bulbs were to be placed. By the 1980s an ongoing series of revisions to the tooling to correct various inaccuracies, which unfortunately created a few new inaccuracies, such as a deflector dish that is far too small and nacelle caps which are shaped incorrectly. There was also a kit of the Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser ship seen on the TV show. It too was lighted in its first couple of issues. By the mid-1970s the Enterprise kit had been joined by a 1:12 scale figure of Spock defending himself against a three-headed reptile on an alien landscape, as well as models of a Romulan Bird Of Prey ship, a Starfleet Shuttlecraft, the Enterprise Bridge, the K-7 Space Station from the episode “The Trouble With Tribbles” and a three-piece Exploration Set consisting of approximately 3/4 scale, toylike models of a phaser, communicator and tricorder. Round 2 has reissued the Spock model, the Romulan Bird Of Prey ship, the Enterprise and the K-7 Space Station, all from the original AMT molds. The Klingon ship was reissued in 2011 and most of the other AMT Star Trek kits are scheduled to be reissued by Round2. In 1968 AMT also produced a kit of a science fiction spaceship Leif Erickson designed by Matt Jeffries, the designer of the Enterprise and Klingon ships for Star Trek. This tooling was reused in the middle 1970s, albeit without several engine and ship parts as well as the original stand and the landing gear to the scout ship, to produce a glow-in-the-dark \\"UFO\\" kit. The glow-in-the-dark UFO model was reissued in 2010 by Round2 from the original molds, this time including the missing ship parts and the scout ship landing gear but still missing some engine parts on the main ship, as well as the original display stand. The Leif Ericson model was reissued in 2011. AMT-Ertl has also reissued the former Model Products Corporation kits of various Star Wars spacecraft and has added several new designs based on the prequel trilogy. ==Fire engines== In 1971 AMT issued models of at least three different pieces of American LaFrance fire- fighting apparatus, including a pumper, a rear-mount aerial ladder truck and a rear-mount articulating boom truck. The prototypes were selected allow part sharing among the kits to minimize tooling costs. All three kits have been reissued by AMT-Ertl in recent years. Surprisingly, given the company's penchant for licensing various television series, they did not offer models of any of the vehicles from the then-current Emergency TV series, such as the Crown Firecoach that was the first Engine 51, the Ward LaFrance P80 Ambassador that was the second Engine 51 or the Dodge rescue squad vehicle. Oddly, none of the decals supplied with the American LaFrance kits included markings for the Los Angeles County Fire Department that was also featured in the series. In addition, they also released a Chevrolet fire chief's car and a Chevrolet rescue van, the latter of which could be built in stock, custom, fire department or police department configurations. ==AMT today== In 1978, British Lesney, makers of Matchbox diecast vehicles, bought AMT and moved the company to Baltimore, closing the Maple Road facility in Troy, Michigan (just outside Detroit). (Cawthon 2002). By this time, prices of plastics had increased and Detroit was squeezed by government regulations of safety, emissions and fuel economy. Detroit sponsored fewer and fewer promotionals so model companies depended more on kits but the model building hobby declined as well. Also, AMT had an incredible display of models and documentary history at its headquarters that was scattered at that time (Anderson 2003). In 1983 AMT was purchased by Ertl from Lesney and renamed AMT-Ertl. AMT-Ertl then had a twenty-four year relationship until AMT was sold in 2007. For a time, AMT kits were reissued by independent companies such as Stevens International and Model King, before AMT came solidly into the stable of Round 2, LLC of South Bend, Indiana. In an ironic turn that parallels other large companies, AMT now co- exists in the same organization alongside a revived MPC and Polar Lights. Ertl is still in the Round 2, LLC stable as Ertl Collectibles. In the early 1990s AMT released brand new kits with new tooling for some of their old favorites, such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera and a few others (Doty 2002b, p. 87). These ultra detailed models can still be had for less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years. Today, Round 2 is making a determined effort to recreate some of the 1960s glory of the model car business. Reissued classics such as the 1962 Buick Electra 225 and the 1961 Ford Galaxie Skyline kits are now available with many of the original features including whitewall tires, metal axles, chassis screws, and molded-in suspension detail. Often the same exact artwork as when the kits originally appeared is reproduced for the new boxes. These reissues cost about $20.00, which is not unreasonable based on the value of the dollar today versus the early 1960s. A few 1950s and 1960s models were reproduced and sold as promotionals featuring the sturdiness of the original 1960s promos in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These included the 1966 Ford Fairlaine GT/A (based on the new tool), the 1964 Ford Galaxie 500/XL hardtop (based on the original tool) and the 1953 and 1954 Corvettes. Today certain AMT kits and promotionals, especially models from the 1960s, command premium prices on the collector market. Typically, original muscle car promos such as Mustangs, Pontiac GTOs, Camaros and Chevelles command prices in the hundreds of dollars in mint, boxed original condition. Even full-size models of GM cars such as Chevrolet Impalas, Pontiac Bonnevilles and Grand Prixs also garner high prices. Such models, like the reissued kits, are easily obtainable through Internet auction sites such as eBay. ==References== *Anderson, Art. 2003. History of Promo Car Models?

The anchor stores are JCPenney, Planet Fitness, Traders Market, and At Home. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Herberger's. ==History== Original anchors were JCPenney and Sears, each of which relocated from downtown Rapid City, and Herberger's, which originally was located on the south side of the mall. Target was added as a fourth anchor on the north side of the mall in 1980, while Herberger's erected a new location west of Target in 1995 and Scheels All Sports replaced the original Herberger's location.

It was the home venue of the WSU Cougars football and track teams until severely damaged by a fire in April 1970. Demolished in early 1971, Rogers Field was replaced by the concrete Martin Stadium, which was built on the same site and opened in 1972. ==History== Originally opened in 1892 for track and field and named \\"Soldier Field\\", it hosted its first football game in 1895, when WSU defeated its Palouse neighbor Idaho 10–4. In 1902, the stadium was renamed for Governor John Rogers, who died in office the previous December. In its early years, it also hosted Cougar baseball, with home plate in the southeast corner. The final structure was completely rebuilt in 1936. The 23,500-seat wooden stadium had a horseshoe-shaped three-section grandstand, open on the west end, with a quarter-mile (402 m) running track. The press box sat at the top of the south sideline's grandstand, and the playing field was natural grass, at an elevation of above sea level. The field was unlit, but plans were in place to install AstroTurf for the 1970 season. The running track was cinder until replaced by an all-weather rubberized surface in early 1968. During what came to be its final WSU season in 1969, Rogers Field was also the home for the neighboring Idaho Vandals. Their Neale Stadium, also wooden, had been condemned during the summer of 1969 due to soil erosion and was to be rebuilt with concrete grandstands, ready in 1970 (or 1971). Idaho played its limited Palouse home schedule in 1969 (3 games) at Rogers Field, and due to delays in their project had planned on playing there again in 1970 (4 games). During the ten-game schedules of the late 1960s, the WSU football team split its usual allotment of four home games equally between Spokane and Pullman (two games each). ==Fire== A suspicious fire in 1970 significantly damaged the south grandstand and press box of Rogers Field late on Saturday, April 4, the first day of spring break. A definitive cause of the blaze was not determined, but was widely believed to have been arson. A track & field meet with Oregon State had been held at the stadium earlier in the day. Idaho's idle (and condemned) Neale Stadium had burned less than five months earlier in November 1969, also a suspected arson which burned its south grandstand and press box. The two-year-old all-weather track at Rogers was saved by students, mostly track athletes, who jumped the fence prior to the arrival of the fire department. The track sections nearest to the fire were watered down to keep them cool, and the highly-flammable foam landing pits (pole vault and high jump) were quickly moved to the grass infield. Prior to the fire, the WSU Cougars had planned to play three home games, all in the Pac-8, at Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane in 1970, which was installing AstroTurf that summer. The two scheduled for Pullman were Idaho in mid-September and Oregon State in mid- November. Various sites were considered, including Husky Stadium in Seattle and Civic Stadium in Portland, but WSU played all five games in Spokane. Despite another one-win season and low turnout for the USC and Oregon State games in November, WSU set a home attendance record in 1970. Requiring less seating capacity, Idaho opted to stay put on the Palouse in 1970 and played its four home games at the partially destroyed stadium in Pullman. The game between the teams, the so-called \\"Displaced Bowl\\", was easily won by WSU on September 19 in Spokane. It ended a ten-game losing streak for Jim Sweeney's Cougars, dating back to the 1969 season opener. As WSU's home opener, the game drew 27,200 spectators, at the time the largest for football in Spokane outside the Apple Cup. The victory over Idaho was the only one for WSU in 1970, as their next win came in the third game of the 1971 season. With the new stadium in Pullman under construction in 1971, the Cougars again played their full home schedule in Spokane, four games, but waited until the last one on October 30 to post a home victory. WSU defeated Oregon, led by quarterback Dan Fouts and running back Bobby Moore (later Ahmad Rashād). The 31–21 win evened WSU's record to 4–4 and 2–2 in the Pac-8, with visions of a possible league title and Rose Bowl appearance. It followed a Cougar upset of defending Rose Bowl champion Stanford by a point on the road; that was Stanford's only conference blemish in 1971, and they repeated as Rose Bowl champions. November was not as fortunate for WSU, which went winless on the road against USC, Oregon State, and Washington to finish at 4–7. Poor weather in the spring of 1971 caused delays in the construction of Idaho's new stadium, and the Vandals played \\"home\\" games at Bronco Stadium in Boise and at Joe Albi in Spokane in September. After a three-year absence, the UI Vandals returned to campus in Moscow on October 9 at their new \\"Idaho Stadium\\", originally an outdoor venue with natural grass. The debut game was a Vandal victory over Idaho State, and Idaho won eight straight games and finished at 8–3, their best football record to date. Artificial turf was installed the next year, and the stadium was enclosed three years later in 1975, renamed the Kibbie Dome. ==Martin Stadium== The new concrete football stadium opened on the site of Rogers Field in 1972. It had a modest seating capacity of 22,600, a running track, lights, and an AstroTurf playing field. The first game in Martin Stadium was on September 30, a disappointing 19-point loss to the Utah Utes of the WAC, with 20,600 in attendance. Initially, only the south grandstand and press box were new in 1972; the old north grandstand was demolished after the 1974 season, and the east end zone seats from Rogers were finally replaced in 1999. Following the 1978 season, the running track was removed and the field level was lowered , allowing a seating capacity expansion with thirteen new rows of seats. The revamped Martin Stadium debuted in mid-October 1979, with an inspired victory over the UCLA Bruins. The last Apple Cup in Spokane was played in 1980, but the Cougars continued to play several home games there through the 1983 season. The WSU academic calendar was changed from a delayed semester to the traditional semester schedule in 1984. With classes starting four weeks earlier in late August, WSU students were now on campus for the entire football season, and the Spokane games were eliminated. (Home games in Seattle at CenturyLink Field were played from 2002 to 2014.) The name \\"Rogers Field\\" continues on campus, transferred to an area used for soccer practices and intramurals, adjacent to the west end of Martin Stadium. ==References== ==External links== * Washington State.scout.com – a history of Rogers Field * Washington State University Athletics – Martin Stadium * Washington State University Libraries – aerial photo of Rogers Field from east, 1961 ** aerial view from east, c. 1931 ** aerial view from northwest, 1928 ** burned south grandstand, 1970 Category:Defunct college football venues Category:Defunct American football venues Category:Demolished sports venues in Washington (state) Category:American football venues in Washington (state) Category:Washington State Cougars football venues Category:Idaho Vandals football venues Category:Buildings and structures in Pullman, Washington Category:Buildings and structures in the United States destroyed by arson Category:Arson in Washington (state) ","title":"Rogers Field (Washington)"},{"id":"7773888","text":"\\"La grey zuliana\\" is a well-known Venezuelan gaita, and is regarded by some as the \\"Anthem of the Gaiteros\\" (Venezuelan gaita musicians).

The predecessor of the present complex structure was begun in the spring of 1558 by Pope Paul IV in the Vatican Gardens, west of the Cortile del Belvedere. Paul IV commissioned the initial project of the 'Casina del Boschetto', as it was originally called, from an unknown architect; the first mention of the single- storey building can be found on 30 April 1558, and a notice of the following 6 May, says that the Pope spent \\"two thirds of his time at the Belvedere, where he has begun to build a fountain in the woods\\". Upon Paul IV's death on 18 August 1559, Pope Pius IV took on the project, which had not yet been completed, and, turning to Pirro Ligorio, improved it. The complex, as it was completed in 1562, comprised an elliptical cortile, two free-standing portals, and the loggia with its fountain. Rich sculptural stuccos, once supplemented by some fifty ancient Roman sculptures, enliven the exterior (illustration).They are not just as Pirro Ligorio designed them; Graham Smith, The Casino of Pius IV, Princeton, N.J., Princeton University Press, 1977, documents 17th-century restorations, replacements in 1824 and major renovations in 1931–35. A team of at least six major painters, including Federico Barocci, Federico Zuccari, and Santi di Tito and their assistants, frescoed the interiors.Smith 1977. The Casina's rich and at times obscure iconographic programme, of the efficacy of baptism, the primacy of the papacy and the welcomed punitive powers of the Church,As examined by Smith 1977. seems to have been inspired by Cardinal Charles Borromeo, nephew of Pius IV, who probably had it in mind as the headquarters for the Academy he was about to found, on 20 April 1562, called Accademia Noctes Vaticanae. Graham Smith suggests that the interrelated iconography of the interior frescoes was inspired by Cardinal Marcantonio da Mula. Pope Pius XI, the founder of the current Pontifical Academy of Sciences, made the Casina the Academy's current headquarters in 1936. ==See also== * Index of Vatican City-related articles ==Notes== ==References== The first modern monograph based on documentation was Walter Friedländer, Das Kasino Pius des Vierten, 1912. * Graham Smith, The Casino of Pius IV, Princeton, N.J., Princeton University Press, 1977; an extended critical review by Loren W.

However, there are multiple Nonconformist chapels throughout the area of Uwchaled, located in many of the minor villages and hamlets. The village was mentioned in the writings of several noted travellers including Edward Lhuyd and George Borrow. It attained a certain significance in the 18th century when Thomas Telford built the A5 turnpike Toll road between London and Holyhead. This would be the main route to Ireland. The road passed through the village. In the farmhouse of Ceirnioge Mawr, where the stagecoach and Mail coach horses were changed, there is a plaque marking the fact that Queen Victoria stopped there en route to Ireland. The current population of the community stands at 692 residents. The community remains one of the heartlands of the Welsh language and in the last census in 2001, 80% stated they had some knowledge of the language and over 76% stated that they used spoken Welsh in their normal every-day life. Remnants of human habitation have been found in the area dating back to the Mesolithic era. Many of these were found in the area of Llyn Brenig, a manmade reservoir to the north of the village. The reservoir was built between 1973 and 1976 and was one of the major British engineering projects of that era. Today it is the most important tourist attraction in the area and provides competition class fly fishing facilities for many visitors. One of the most famous sons of the parish is Jac Glan-y-Gors, who was a leading Radical at the end of the 18th century. His ideas were published in the polemical pamphlets Seren tan Gwmwl (\\"Star under a Cloud\\") and Toriad y Dydd (\\"Break of Day\\"). Cerrigydruidion Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1898. The club and course disappeared at the time of WW2.“Cerrigydruidion Golf Club”, “Golf’s Missing Links”. Heading out of Cerrigydrudion up a minor road off the B5105 is an iron age hill fort called Caer Caradog.http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=32597 This fort dates to pre Roman times and although the origin of the fort's name is unclear,https://historicplacenames.rcahmw.gov.uk/placenames/recordedname/edea3462-81bb-4b5f-9b22-343bd1df5a20 as Caradog can be latinised as Caratacus, it possibly refers to the 1st century warrior Caratacus who fought against the Romans. A novel published in 2018 called Swords and Slavery describes a battle between Celts and Romans at this forthttps://davidclees.wixsite.com/mysite/novel ==Climate== The Cerrigydrudion area possesses an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Due to its upland setting, it tends to be cooler than coastal areas of Wales throughout the year, and heavy snowfall can occur during winter months. The nearest MetOffice weather station at Alwen, about 2.5 miles to the North, holds the Welsh record for the coldest day for the months of June, September and October ==Economy and daily life== Saint Mary Magdalene Parish Church The White Lion The biggest employer in the parish remains agriculture although tourism related work is becoming common. Apart from the church the village has two active Nonconformist chapels. These are Jerusalem, which is dedicated to the Methodist Calvinist group, and Moriah which follows the Congregational path. A third chapel, Seion, which was part of the Wesleyan tradition, was closed in 2002. The village has one public house, The White Lion this was owned in the 1970s by the famous Welsh entertainer Ronnie Williams who formed half of the duo Ryan and Ronnie. It once received as a guest the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was unable to return home due to heavy snowfall. Across the road from The White Lion is The Queens Head, which closed in the 1990s. Other facilities include a cafe on the A5 main road called Ty Tan Llan Cafe, public toilets, library, a grocery shop and post office called Siop Uwchaled. Nearby is the older Alwen Reservoir, built between 1909 and 1921 to provide drinking water for the English town of Birkenhead. At its conception the engineer who designed the dam, George Deacon, also planned Llyn Brenig, built over half a century later. One of the most popular social gatherings in the village occurs on the first Saturday in September when the local Agricultural Show takes place. This attracts upwards of 3,000 people and is one of the most successful non-county shows in Wales. ==Popular culture== The area has received some notoriety amongst music fans since Julian Cope's 2007 release A Child Is Born In Cerrig Y Drudion. ==References== ==External links== * Cerrigydrudion Community Council Website * A Vision of Britain Through Time * British Listed Buildings * Clwyd Churches * Eastern Conwy Churches Survey * Genuki * Geograph * Office for National Statistics * Welcome to Cerrigydrudion ","title":"Cerrigydrudion"},{"id":"7773991","text":":This article is specifically about the production history of the television series Blake's 7: for a more general overview of this series, please see the main Blake's 7 article. Blake's 7 is a British science fiction television programme that was produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for its station BBC1. Set in the far future, Blake's 7 follows the fortunes of a group of rebels in their fight against the dictatorial Terran Federation. Four thirteen-episode series were produced between 1978 and 1981. Blake's 7 was created by Terry Nation, who later described it as \\"The Dirty Dozen in space”. David Maloney was assigned to produce the series and Chris Boucher was appointed as the script editor. Gareth Thomas was cast as the eponymous Blake. The series' budget was severely restricted, which limited the scope for visual effects. Nation wrote the first 13-episode series and contributed a further six scripts in the second and third series. Twelve additional writers provided material for the series. After three successful series, Blake's 7 was unexpectedly commissioned for a further series. Vere Lorrimer was appointed as producer, and oversaw major changes in its format. Following the dramatic finale of the fourth series, Blake's 7 was not re-commissioned and the programme ended. == Origins (1975–1976) == In 1975, Terry Nation attended a meeting with Ronnie Marsh, the BBC's Head of Serials, to discuss ideas for new television series. Marsh was looking for formats for co-productions with American television channels. Nation suggested a number of ideas, mostly for crime dramas, none of which appealed to Marsh. According to Nation, \\"...the interview was drawing to a close when I surprised myself by starting to detail a new science fiction adventure [...] 'Have you got a title?' someone asked. Blake's 7 I replied without hesitation.\\" Marsh's notes of the meeting survive and record the pitch Nation made as follows: “cracking Boy's Own/ kidult sci- fi. A space Western adventure. A modern swashbuckler. Blake's Seven. Group of villains being escorted onto a rocket ship (transported) which goes astray and lands on an alien planet, where inhabitants are planning to invade and destroy Earth. Possibly live underground.\\" Nation left the meeting with a commission for a pilot script and \\"...the bewildered feeling that [...] I could not trace the source of the idea\\". Nation submitted his pilot script, titled \\"Blake's 7 – A Television Series created by Terry Nation\\", in April 1976, sub-titling the draft episode Cygnus Alpha. Nation's pilot script broadly resembled what would become The Way Back, the first episode of Blake's 7 to be transmitted, although the agent who betrays Glyd's group and plots Blake's conviction was named Cral Travis, rather than Dev Tarrant in the transmitted episode. The proposed characters for the series were: Rog (later changed to Roj) Blake, Vila Restal, Jenna Stannis, Kerr Avon, Olag Gan, Arco Trent, Tone Selman and Brell Klein. The descriptions of Blake, Jenna and Gan are similar to those of the developed characters. However, Vila's character is somewhat different, described as “thirty five, a good-looking athletic”, he appeared more similar to the popular fictional character Simon Templar than the Vila portrayed on screen. The character of Arco Trent was described as a powerful figure in the Administration who had become a scapegoat for a group of corrupt officials involved in arms dealing. Arco would plot against Blake but would gain respect for him after Blake saves his life. Arco's sidekick would be Avon, a self- serving, treacherous coward. The characters of Selman and Klein did not appear in the pilot script, which noted that these characters would join the series in a later episode. Marsh asked Nation for a draft script for a second episode of Blake's 7 in June 1976. Two months later, Nation delivered Space Fall, in which the spacecraft Liberator was introduced. On 12 November, Marsh commissioned Space Fall and confirmed the series for full development. Marsh asked Nation to deliver a further five scripts. It was intended that 13 episodes of Blake's 7 would be produced to replace the police drama Softly, Softly: Taskforce. Nation would write the first seven episodes, the following four would be written by other writers and Nation would write a two-part finale. Blake's 7 now officially entered production. == Series One (1977–1978) == The Blake's 7 cast in Series One (1978): Michael Keating (Vila); Jan Chappell (Cally); Gareth Thomas (Blake); Sally Knyvette (Jenna); Paul Darrow (Avon) and David Jackson (Gan). Zen is behind. The BBC chose David Maloney to produce Blake's 7 because of his experience with Doctor Who. Maloney approached Robert Holmes, as a script editor. Holmes declined, as he was script editing Doctor Who, but he recommended Chris Boucher, who had previously written three scripts for Doctor Who. Early in 1977, Nation was commissioned to write four more episodes for Series One and five episodes for Series Two. He was now contracted to write all thirteen episodes of the first series. The BBC had expanded Nation's writing commitment in order that Nation's high-profile would help the promotion of the series. Providing a large amount of material in a short time would prove difficult for Nation. Admitting that he had agreed to write every episode out of \\"ego and supreme confidence\\", Nation later recalled that he returned home following the commission and told his wife, \\"I think I've got myself into deep trouble!\\" Nation informed Boucher that he would only be able to deliver the first draft of each script, telling Boucher, \\"...you can have rewrites or you can have the next episode: which do you want?” As a result, while Nation created the plots, Boucher provided a great deal of input into the characters and dialogue. According to Boucher, \\"Terry came up with the characters, he came up with thirteen good stories, but he didn't come up with the dialogue. I remember saying, and I think it's pretty close to the truth, that for a long time, Paul Darrow [playing Avon] never spoke a line that I hadn't written or altered to make the lines sharper.\\" The strain of writing all thirteen episodes was starting to affect Nation. His tenth script – The Invaders, in which Gan would fight an alien duplicate of himself intent on taking over the Liberator – was abandoned and replaced by a script titled Brain Drain (later renamed Breakdown) which partially re-used some elements of The Invaders. Nation later recalled: \\"During those thirteen weeks, I ran entirely out of ideas, and I'd sit around and walk for days, saying, 'There are no more ideas, that's it! I've shot it all and it's gone'.\\" One episode badly affected by Nation's difficulties was Bounty; even after Boucher had rewritten it, director Pennant Roberts was required to lengthen the scenes to fill the fifty-minute running time. === Script and character alterations === One script was abandoned early; Locate and Destroy was originally planned as the fourth episode. This story would have re-introduced the character Travis, first seen in the pilot script, now with a mechanical arm and an eye patch. Travis would be ordered by his superior officer, \\"Commander Shervalan\\", to recapture Blake. This script's plot elements would later be used in the episodes Duel, Mission to Destiny and Deliverance. The last of these centred on Travis attacking the Liberator while Jenna was captured by primitives living on a planet ravaged by a biological weapon released by the Federation. Travis was later renamed Dev Tarrant in the opening episode The Way Back; the Travis that appeared from Seek-Locate- Destroy onwards was a new character, while \\"Commander Shervalan\\" became female and was renamed Servalan. The characters of Trent, Selman and Klein were removed from the series, although Trent and Selman appeared as Blake's fellow prisoners and were then killed in the broadcast version of Cygnus Alpha. These characters were removed in order to control costs and to give the remaining characters more work. Blake's 7 would now comprise Blake himself; Avon, who acquired the scheming nature of Arco Trent; Vila, who now acquired the cowardly aspect originally planned for Avon; Jenna; Gan; Zen, the Liberator computer; and a new character: the telepathic alien, Cally, who was added to balance the gender mix among the cast. This character had similarities to that of Doctor Who companion Leela – created by Boucher, who was inspired by the Palestinian hijacker Leila Khaled. Stevens and Moore speculate that Boucher had a large part in the creation of Cally, whose skin and hair were to be coloured red, while coloured contact lenses would be worn by the actress when Cally entered a telepathic trance, giving her a more alien appearance. These ideas were finally abandoned to reduce costs and save time. === Casting and production staff === { class=\\"infobox\\" -  Series Created by   Terry Nation -  Script Editor   Chris Boucher -  Producers   David Maloney (Series 1-3) Vere Lorrimer (Series 4) -  Theme music   Dudley Simpson - !

Casting was now in progress. Gareth Thomas was chosen to play Blake at the suggestion of Terry Nation. Paul Darrow, who had been considered for the part of Blake, was cast as Avon. Michael Keating was suggested for the role of Vila by Pennant Roberts; the pair had worked together on the Doctor Who serial The Sun Makers. David Jackson, who was known to David Maloney from Maloney's acting career, was cast as Gan. While watching Jackson on stage at the Royal Court Theatre, Maloney and Vere Lorrimer noted Jan Chappell, who would be cast as Cally. Sally Knyvette, who had been recommended by director Bill Sellars following her work on the serial Who Pays the Ferryman?, was cast as Jenna. Peter Tuddenham was cast as Zen. Stephen Greif, who was appearing in the BBC sitcom Citizen Smith, was cast as Blake's nemesis, Travis. Ingrid Pitt had originally been considered for the role of Travis' superior, Servalan, but the role went to Jacqueline Pearce. Three directors – Pennant Roberts, Michael E. Briant and Lennie Mayne – who had directed Doctor Who episodes – were assigned to Blake's 7. The directors would work in rotation, each directing four episodes. Episode seven would be directed by Paul Ciappessoni. Mayne was killed in a boating accident and was replaced by Vere Lorrimer. The eighth episode, Duel, was directed by another Doctor Who veteran, Douglas Camfield. Maloney assembled the rest of his production team and engaged Roger Murray-Leach, with whom he had worked on the Doctor Who serials Planet of Evil, The Deadly Assassin and The Talons of Weng-Chiang, as production designer. To ensure uniformity of concept, Maloney asked Murray-Leach to design both the interior and exterior of the Liberator spacecraft. Murray-Leach \\"...turned the ship around, so it was drawn to look as if it were going one way but flew the other way. In fact, if you take the line of flow, the angles go with it to get a sense of speed, and we turned that around so the 'wings' all canted forwards, not backwards\\". Murray-Leach's role as designer of the ship proved to be contentious with the series' special effects designer, Ian Scoones. Scoones found Murray-Leach's design for the Liberator awkward to mount and film for the scenes of the ship in flight. === Filming and broadcast === Aware that Star Wars would be released in cinemas across the United Kingdom around the same time as the planned television debut of Blake's 7, Scoones spent the budget he had been allocated for the entire series on Space Fall, the first episode to be recorded but the second to be broadcast. The model filming for this episode, the first piece of filming for the series, took place at Bray Studios on 15 August 1977. Live action filming of Blake's 7 began on 26 September that year at Ealing film studios with scenes set on the spacecraft London for the episode Space Fall. Filming continued at Ealing and on location, and then moved into the studios at BBC Television Centre in November. The series' animated title sequence was created by Bob Blagden, and was based partially on suggestions given by Nation in his draft pilot script. Nation had envisaged a vast computer that would print out pictures of each of the characters; these would be deposited in a tray marked \\"Enemies of the State\\" before the appearance of the title caption. The theme music was written by Dudley Simpson who composed much of the incidental music. Shortly after recording began, problems with the filming schedule became obvious. Blake's 7 had inherited its production style – a method called strike filming – from the series it was to replace: Softly, Softly: Taskforce. Strike filming involved pre-filming, either on location or at a film studio, immediately before entering rehearsals for the scenes to be recorded in the videotape studios. This method worked well for a series such as Softly, Softly which had minimal pre-filming, few special effects and a large number of standing sets. However, it was unsuitable for Blake's 7. Shooting schedules began to overrun, leading to expensive remounts and to cast members being taken out of rehearsals, either for pre-filming or for remounts of scenes that had not been filmed on schedule. These problems peaked in January 1978 when, in the course of one week, the cast were working on four different episodes for four different directors. Recording was further complicated when Stephen Greif, playing Travis, ruptured his Achilles tendon playing squash and had to be replaced by an extra for the studio scenes for the episode Orac. The recording of the first series of Blake's 7 was completed on 15 March. The first episode of Blake's 7 was first broadcast on BBC1 on 2 January at 6:00 pm. Subsequent episodes were broadcast on Mondays at 7:15 pm. It would compete against the popular soap opera Coronation Street and sitcoms A Sharp Intake of Breath and Miss Jones and Son on the rival ITV network. Blake's 7 received an average 9.2 million viewers and attaining an average reaction index of 67. == Series Two (1978–1979) == === Planning === Planning for a second series of Blake's 7 began in January 1978 after three episodes of the first series had been screened. Maloney and Boucher met with Nation and his agent Roger Hancock, to discuss the new series. New writers would be engaged and, although Nation would be consulted on general storylines, he would not be involved in choosing the writers or approving scripts. A story arc was planned, which would revolve around Blake's attempt to attack the Federation Supreme Computer Control. This would be located at a place called Storm Mountain which, when attacked by Blake in a mid-series climax, would be discovered to be a decoy. The rest of the series would follow Blake as he sought the real computer control, designated Star One. Travis would be dismissed from the Federation but would continue his vendetta against Blake. The general plans for the series was outlined in a document titled Blake's Seven – Series Two – General Notes. This document noted that \\"...the Federation must be shown to be even more powerful, even more ruthless and even more intelligent\\". To show this, the producers decided that one of the main characters would die. Nation, unhappy with Michael Keating's interpretation of the role, was keen for Vila to be killed. Nation's view was opposed by Boucher and Maloney because the character was popular with viewers. A commissioned Audience Research Report on the first series had indicated that Avon was the most popular character followed by Blake, Jenna, Vila, Cally and Gan. It is likely that this report influenced the decision to kill Gan. === Writing === Terry Nation was commissioned to write five episodes for Series Two: episode one, which would resolve the cliffhanger from Series One; episode 6, in which Blake would assault Storm Mountain; episode 10, which would be a stand-alone adventure and episodes 12 and 13, a two-part finale in which Blake would reach Star One and would uncover a plot by aliens to invade the galaxy, forcing Blake to ally himself with the Federation to defeat the aliens. In interviews given by Terry Nation, he suggested that the Daleks, a race of alien villains he had created for Doctor Who, would appear in Blake's 7, leading to rumours that Nation intended them to be encountered by Blake at Star One. To assist the new writers, Boucher wrote a General Notes and Baffle Gab Glossary that explained the format of the series, the characters' backgrounds and outlined the various technical terms – such as \\"spacials\\" and \\"teleport\\" - that the series employed. Boucher wanted to write for the series and in May 1978 received clearance to write up to three scripts. Robert Holmes, Allan Prior, Roger Parkes and Pip and Jane Baker were commissioned to write the remainder of the episodes. It was intended that Boucher would write episode two, which would re-introduce Travis and Servalan; Holmes would write episode three, which would be an Orac story and Boucher would then provide the fourth episode, which would introduce the Storm Mountain storyline. Pip and Jane Baker's script, Death Squad, would follow, then Nation's Storm Mountain story. Boucher's next script would cover Travis' court-martial and Prior would write a script centred on a Ugandan-style society. This plan was later revised; Boucher would write episodes two and three, taking the story centred on Orac, while Holmes would write the fourth episode, which would introduce Storm Mountain. The order in which the episodes were broadcast was rather different. Death Squad by Pip and Jane Baker – in which Blake, Gan and Jenna would infiltrate a Federation facility attempting to create 'super-soldiers' by administering drugs to humans, leading to Blake and Gan becoming exposed to the drugs and Jenna being held by Servalan as an inducement for the scientist behind the plan – was abandoned. This was ostensibly on cost grounds, although Boucher had concerns about the quality of the script. The episodes were re- ordered; Horizon, Allan Prior's 'Ugandan' script replaced Death Squad, while Holmes' script, Killer, became the seventh episode. Pressure Point, Terry Nation's Storm Mountain script, became the fifth and Trial, the Travis court- martial story, was moved to sixth. The scripting problems intensified in September 1978 when Nation informed Boucher that he was having problems writing the two-part finale. Nation had made several aborted attempts to write episode twelve and had not begun writing episode thirteen. Nation's scripts were cancelled and the final two episodes were re-commissioned. Allan Prior was commissioned to write episode twelve, which became The Keeper, while Boucher wrote Star One using Nation's original outline. { class=\\"infobox\\" - !

David Jackson (Gan) was not upset that his character would die because Jackson was given little to do in many episodes. According to Chris Boucher, Jackson once passed him a note with the word 'four' written on it. When Boucher queried the note, Jackson explained that 'four' was the number of lines he had in that week's script. It was originally intended that Gan would be killed by a double agent who would then join the Liberator crew as a Federation spy. Stephen Greif, who had torn an Achilles tendon while playing squash during the filming of the first series, had left to pursue other roles. Brian Croucher was cast to replace Greif in the role of Space Commander Travis. It was decided that Orac would become a regular character. Derek Farr, who had voiced Orac in its debut, was unavailable and Peter Tuddenham, who was already voicing Zen, was engaged to play Orac. At the end of Series Two, the actors' 26-episode contracts would expire. Neither Gareth Thomas nor Sally Knyvette wished to return for a third series. Thomas was disappointed not to be allowed to direct a few episodes, and had been offered a role with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and sought an exit of the show. He would return twice – once in the series 3 finale, Terminal, and once more in the final episode of the series, Blake, when his character was killed off. Knyvette, encouraged by Bruce Purchase, a guest actor on The Keeper, wished to study full-time for a Master of Arts degree, studying Chaucer, and sought to leave the show. She did not appear in any further episodes after series 2. Because of the loss of the titular character, Nation considered introducing a 'substitute Blake' character in Countdown, the third story he was scheduled to write that year. It can be speculated that the character of Del Grant, who appears in Countdown, was intended to be this 'Blake substitute'. The 'Blake substitute' also appears in one of the early drafts of Allan Prior's episode Hostage. While Nation's original outline for the two-part series finale involved Jenna and Vila being killed, Boucher was aware that Gan's death had upset some viewers, and chose to have Blake and Jenna disappear from the narrative between the end of Star One and the opening story of Series Three. Travis was killed at the end of Star One, having no Blake upon whom to focus his vendetta against the Liberator crew. The only director to return for Series Three was Vere Lorrimer. The other directors appointed were George Spenton-Foster, Jonathan Wright Miller and Derek Martinus. Because of the difficulties caused by the use of strike filming, Series Two was recorded using block filming. This filming method involved a month of location filming for the first six episodes before the studio videotape recording of those episodes, each director being assigned to work on two episodes. The process was repeated for the next six episodes and the final episode would be recorded on its own. === Filming and broadcast === Filming on Series Two began on Monday 31 July 1978 at Oldbury-on-Severn nuclear power station near Bristol and finished on Thursday 8 March 1979. The recording of the episode Hostage was complicated when guest actor Duncan Lamont died between the location and studio recordings. Lamont was initially replaced by Ronald Lewis, who proved to be unsuitable for health reasons and was quickly replaced by John Abineri. Vere Lorrimer was unavailable for the recording of Star One, so David Maloney replaced him but was not credited because of rules forbidding producers to direct their own programmes. Redemption, the opening episode of Series Two, was broadcast on Tuesday, 9 January 1979 at 7:20 pm with subsequent episodes following at about the same time each Tuesday. Pressure Point was broadcast at 8:10 pm because of coverage of the Variety Club Awards. Competition on ITV came from the popular US programme Charlie's Angels. BBC Wales opted out of transmission, broadcast regional programming instead and showed Blake's 7 on Sunday afternoons. Ratings averaged 7 million; although two million lower than the previous series, a third series was assured. == Series Three (1979–1980) == The Blake's 7 cast in Series Three (1980): Steven Pacey (Tarrant); Josette Simon (Dayna); Michael Keating (Vila); Jan Chappell (Cally) and Paul Darrow (Avon) === Planning === Planning for the third series began in November 1978. Gareth Thomas' departure meant the series would continue without Blake. According to David Maloney, \\"...a decision had to be made to go with a third series or stop it completely. Terry Nation, naturally, was for going on with it, and I think Ronnie Marsh was too, because of the viewing figures. [...] I think it was felt that they couldn't take it off, so why not be cheeky and do Blake's 7 without Blake?\\". === Storyline ideas === Nation was requested to write several scripts and to influence the format of the new series. As before, a story arc was planned. During the first half of the series, the Liberator crew would search for the missing Blake and in a mid-series climax would discover his grave. Nation was commissioned to write the first two episodes, which would establish the new format and characters. The final story of the series would, it was intended, conclude Blake's 7. By December, the idea of a new lead character, 'The Captain', was mooted. The Captain, envisaged as being aged between 35 and 55, would be veteran of the Intergalactic War that began in Series Two. 'The Captain' would become the Liberator crew's new leader and would ultimately betray the crew to the Federation for personal profit. Maloney was concerned that casting an older, well-known actor for the final series of an established series would be difficult. He persuaded Nation to change 'The Captain' – now named Del Tarrant – into a younger character. Tarrant is a corruption of Nation's name that appears frequently in his work. Nation imagined this new, younger Tarrant as \\"...someone like the Spitfire pilots of World War II, who were young and didn't know the meaning of fear\\". Instead of Tarrant, Avon would become the lead character of the series. The intention was to soften the character of Avon and make him more moralistic. This was resisted vehemently by Paul Darrow who believed that it was Avon's anti-heroic qualities that appealed to viewers. Darrow was also sceptical of the idea of Avon searching for Blake, considering Avon's oft-stated aim of taking control of the Liberator. The difficulties experienced with the script-writing of Series Three meant that the story arc was largely abandoned, although there are references to Avon's search for Federation torturer 'Shrinker' in episodes prior to their encounter in Rumours of Death. Tarrant became a more heroic character than originally intended. A new title sequence, featuring the Liberator and three Federation pursuit ships, was created by Doug Burd to replace the original sequence that features Gareth Thomas prominently. It was decided that the series would conclude with the destruction of Liberator, the scenes for which were filmed on the series' final day of recording, Friday 7 March 1980. Special effects designer Jim Francis, who had the task of destroying the sets on camera, recalled; \\"It was a big set to destroy. [...] All the pyrotechnics and the big beams dropping from the ceiling could only be done once, which meant we couldn't rehearse it. Everybody did what they were told, and it looked great\\". === New characters === { class=\\"infobox\\" - !

Remembering his audition, Pacey said, \\"...reading the character breakdown, and it said, 'Del Tarrant is thirty-five years old-' and I thought, 'This is a bit silly, I'm only twenty-one'. I went downstairs thinking it was a waste of time, and saw other actors who all seemed nearer the right age. When I went to see David Maloney [...] his advice to me was to keep my performance as gritty as possible\\". Maloney was concerned that Pacey's curly hair made Pacey look similar to Gareth Thomas. Judith Smith, Maloney's production secretary, recalled that \\"...there was all the rigmarole about trying to straighten his hair and can we cut it really short, and what can we do?\\". To replace Jenna, Nation created Dayna Mellanby, a skilled combat expert partly based on the character of Miranda from Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Nation \\"...thought it would be interesting to have a girl who was aggressive, to have somebody who would kill first and ask questions later, and it was nice to give what are generally masculine attitudes to a woman\\". Josette Simon was chosen to play Dayna; Simon had recently graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and did not have an Equity card. === Writers and directors === Writers Allan Prior and Robert Holmes returned for the new series. New to the series were Ben Steed, a short story writer who had also written for Coronation Street, and Crown Court; Tanith Lee, a successful fantasy novelist; James Follet, who had written science fiction serials for radio, notably Earthsearch; Trevor Hoyle, who had published two novelisations of Terry Nation's Series One scripts and John Fletcher. Chris Boucher intended to write two scripts, one of which would be City on the Edge of the World. This script was prompted by a request by Michael Keating, who later recalled, \\"...my daughter, who was about five or six at the time, thought Vila was stupid; Chris Boucher said, 'I'll write you a story where you get the girl'\\". Difficulties arose with Robert Holmes' story, entitled Sweetly Dreaming... Slowly Dying, and John Fletcher's story about Hell's Angels in space. Both scripts were abandoned. Ben Steed was commissioned to write the replacement for Sweetly Dreaming... Slowly Dying which became Moloch, while Boucher replaced the Fletcher script with Death- Watch. Vere Lorrimer, the only returning director, directed four episodes in Series Three. The remaining episodes were directed by Desmond McCarthy, Gerald Blake, Andrew Morgan, Fiona Cumming and Mary Ridge. David Maloney directed Powerplay, the first episode to be recorded, to help the new cast members to settle into their roles. === Filming and broadcast === Recording of Series Three began on Monday 30 July 1979 and continued until March 1980. During filming on location and at Ealing Studios, industrial action began at BBC Television Centre in late 1979, which disrupted many BBC programmes. When filming was completed and the cast and crew were ready for recording at Television Centre, the strike had ended and Blake's 7 was unaffected. Because Terminal was intended to conclude Blake's 7, Maloney persuaded Gareth Thomas to reprise the role of Blake. Thomas was not available for the studio recording days so his scenes were filmed in a village hall near Pyrton Hill, Oxfordshire, where the scenes set on the planet Terminal were being filmed. While on location for that episode, an accident occurred during a rehearsal for a stunt; Deep Roy, an extra, needed treatment for a broken collarbone. The first episode of Series Three was transmitted on Monday, 7 January 1980 at 7:15 pm. Competition came from Coronation Street, game show Give Us a Clue and sitcom Keep it in the Family. Coverage of the Winter Olympics meant that the episode Children of Auron was shown on a Tuesday; the series returned to its regular time the following week. The series was watched by an average of 9.5 million viewers. When the final episode, Terminal, was shown on 31 March 1980, the Blake's 7 production office had closed and the cast and crew had dispersed. They were surprised that, during the closing credits of Terminal, the continuity announcer declared that a new series of Blake's 7 would be shown the following year. The Head of BBC Television, Bill Cotton, was impressed by Terminal as he watched its broadcast at home. He telephoned BBC Presentation and instructed that an announcement be made during the end credits that the series would return. == Series Four (1980–1981) == The Blake's 7 cast in Series Four (1981): Glynis Barber (Soolin); Josette Simon (Dayna); Paul Darrow (Avon); Michael Keating (Vila) and Steven Pacey (Tarrant). Orac is in the foreground. === Production staff === Producing the new series presented significant challenges since several of the cast and crew were engaged in other projects and the Liberator sets had been destroyed during the recording of Terminal. Chris Boucher was available and willing to return as script editor. However, David Maloney was now working on The Day of the Triffids and When the Boat Comes In and was not available. Maloney suggested that Vere Lorrimer, who had directed episodes in all previous series, had the necessary experience to produce Blake's 7. Lorrimer travelled to Los Angeles to meet Terry Nation – who was now working as a Hollywood producer – to discuss the series' new format. Nation approved the changes but played little part in the development of this series. Director Mary Ridge returned, directing the first episode to ensure continuity with Series Three's closing episode Terminal. The other directors hired for the series were David Sullivan Proudfoot, Vivienne Cozens, Brian Lighthill and Viktors Ritelis. When David Sullivan Proudfoot was taken ill during the shooting of Assassin, Vere Lorrimer replaced him to direct some of this episode's scenes. === Story ideas === The Liberators destruction led to major changes to the series' format. Chris Boucher has suggested that the fourth series can be viewed as an entirely new series. In this series, the rebels would have a planetary base on the planet Xenon – spelt Zenon in early drafts. The story arc proposed for this series involved Avon recruiting scientists and using their expertise to resist the Federation. Because this would impose a running order on the episodes, and because the rebels could become too powerful, the scripts often ended with the scientist dead and the rebels gaining nothing. Avon, still the leader of the group, was portrayed as being increasingly determined to destroy the Federation, in contrast to the first series where Avon had dismissed Blake's aims as insane, his own being to obtain wealth. Avon becomes increasingly self-centred and paranoid: in Stardrive he showed few reservations about causing the death of a scientist in order to escape Federation pursuit ships; and in Orbit he threatened to do the same to Vila. In Blake, Avon kills his former comrade whom he accuses of betrayal, unaware that Blake was playing a double game in order to recruit freedom fighters genuinely opposed to the Federation. From an early stage, Lorrimer and Boucher doubted that Blake's 7 would be renewed for a fifth series. Boucher was disappointed; he thought that an additional series would have enabled the cast and crew to become comfortable with the new format. The first proposal for the series' conclusion, titled Attack, involved Blake returning to lead an assault on the Federation on Earth, finally defeating them. This idea was rejected by Lorrimer, who thought it \\"...would be like five men trying to defeat the German army\\". Influenced by the films Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Wild Bunch, Boucher decided that concluding the series in a shoot-out would provide a more memorable ending. Apart from Blake, the characters' fates would be deliberately ambiguous in case a fifth series was commissioned. Blake was to be given the dying words; \\"Oh Avon, I didn't take any of them on trust... except you... You are my... only friend\\", but these were removed because Blake's ability to deliver them after the violence of his shooting stretched credibility. === Character changes === { class=\\"infobox\\" - !

Jan Chappell had become dissatisfied with the role of Cally. Chappell was asked to reprise the role, first for six episodes, then three and finally one. She declined, but recorded an uncredited voiceover for Cally's death in Rescue. To replace Cally, Boucher created Soolin, a 25-year-old gunslinger. The character's name partly derived from Boucher's wife's name, Lynn. Soolin had killed the man who raised and trained her in revenge for his murder of her parents. Glynis Barber, who had played a Mutoid in the first series episode Project Avalon, was cast as Soolin. Barber would later attain fame in Dempsey and Makepeace. Jacqueline Pearce had fallen ill and was hospitalised shortly after Series Three had finished recording. Believing that Pearce may not be available, a new female villain – Commissioner Sleer – was devised. When Pearce indicated her availability for the series, Sleer became Servalan's pseudonym, Servalan being considered dead by the Federation's new regime. Gareth Thomas agreed to return for a final appearance as Blake on the condition that his character would be irrevocably killed. === Sets and models === Vere Lorrimer decided that the new series should be darker and less glamorous than its predecessors. The crew would acquire a new spacecraft that should be somewhat cramped and more functional, akin to the Nostromo from the film Alien, than the Liberator. Chris Boucher, writing the opening episode, Rescue, created the Scorpio, describing it as \\"a fairly small and undistinguished looking cargo ship, moderately scruffy and beaten up\\". The Scorpio model was designed by Jim Francis and constructed by Ron Thornton, later of Foundation Imaging. The Scorpios interior was designed by Roger Cann and director Mary Ridge, who worked to make the new set easier to shoot on and less fragile than the Liberator sets had been. === Writing === The first six scripts were commissioned from writers familiar with the series – Ben Steed, Robert Holmes, James Follet, Allan Prior and Roger Parkes. Scripts for the second six episodes were commissioned from established writers Robert Holmes and Tanith Lee and from new writers Rod Beacham, Bill Lyons, Colin Davis and Simon Masters. Scripts that were commissioned but abandoned were Ragnarok by former Doctor Who producer Graham Williams and Man of Iron by Paul Darrow, about an attempt by Servalan to regain power using androids created by the scientist Algor on the planet Epsilon. Because of the uncertainty over Jan Chappell's availability, most of the early scripts were written for Cally, whose lines were given to Soolin. A scene of Vila crying while hiding from Avon, who is intent on killing him, was removed from the final edit of the episode Orbit as it was felt to be too strong for a family programme. === Filming and broadcast === Filming for Series Four commenced on Monday 23 February 1981 on location at Pyrton Hill for the scenes in Rescue set on the planet Terminal. Location filming for the final episode, Blake, took place between 13 and 15 October 1981. Following rehearsals, recording began in the studio at BBC Television Centre on 5 November 1981. The final shoot-out was recorded on 6 November. Recording on Blake's 7 concluded on Saturday 7 November 1981. A new title sequence, featuring a new logo for the series, was created by Doug Burd. Vere Lorrimer wrote lyrics, titled Distant Star, for the series theme music with the notion that Steven Pacey would sing them over a new arrangement of the theme by Norrie Paramour. Pacey did not agree with this idea, and Dudley Simpson created a more lively arrangement of the theme for the closing titles. Unknown to Ridge, Thomas was determined to eliminate any ambiguity over Blake's death. He had arranged with the visual effects team to ensure that as much blood as possible was seen when Blake was killed. Ridge was somewhat shocked when Thomas set off the charge to create the gunshot effect during the recording of his final scene. The final series of Blake's 7 began transmission on Monday 28 September 1981, competing with Coronation Street, game show Bullseye and sitcom Never the Twain (replaced mid-series by Astronauts). The series attracted an average of 8.5 million viewers. The apparent massacre at the end of the final episode provoked a strong reaction from many viewers, who were upset to see their heroes meet a grisly fate. Chris Boucher believed that the date on which the final episode was broadcast – 21 December 1981 – was unfortunate, and has since described himself as \\"the man who killed Father Christmas\\". == See also == *Blake's 7 *List of Blake's 7 episodes *:Category:Blake's 7 characters == References == Category:Blake's 7 Blake's 7 ","title":"History of Blake's 7"},{"id":"7773994","text":"Taylor is a sept (\\"branch\\") of Clan Cameron, a Scottish clan.

Others, with no documented connection to Taillear Dubh na Tuaighe or the Clan Cameron, are simply descended from those with an occupational surname meaning tailor. Though Donald's father was XIV Chief of Clan Cameron, Donald, born out of wedlock, could not inherit the title.

As a young man, Donald became skilled in battle with the Lochaber axe, and his nickname evolved to Taillear Dubh na Tuaighe (\\"Black Taylor of the Axe\\") because of his fighting prowess.

There, descendants of his family and followers became known as Mac-an-taillear (\\"son of the tailor\\"). ==Later history== In the 18th century, MacInTaillear, Macintaylor, Taylor, and Tayler families were still living on the Cowal peninsula.

When Israel came into being in 1948, many Jews migrated to Israel, and after the Arab-Israel war a majority of them left Karachi.

The last custodian of the synagogue was Rachel Joseph, now deceased. Dan Kiesel, a Jew of German origin, was employed as a physiotherapist by the Pakistan Cricket Board from 1995–1999. His appointment brought some controversy, as Pakistani politicians questioned the hiring an Israeli Jew in the Senate of Pakistan.Weil, Shalva. 2011 \\"The History and Disappearance of the Jewish Presence in Pakistan\\", ETH Zürich. https://css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital- library/articles/article.html/130984/pdf The term \\"Yehudi\\" and its variants remains a word of derision when directed at a Bene Israel or anyone else as noted by Reverend John Wilson, one of the founders of University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai).

By 2017, according to the Election Commission of Pakistan around 900 Jews were registered as voters in the country.also in 2017 According to the National Database and Registration Authority, there are 745 registered Jewish families in Pakistan. Most of the Karachi Jews now live in Ramla, Israel, Mumbai, India and Toronto, Ontario, Canada with several spread throughout the United States of America and built a synagogue they named Magen Shalome after the Pakistani Synagogue in Ramla.

Before the 1970s, generally there were no anti-Semitic feelings towards the Jews of Pakistan. ===Mewa Shah Graveyard=== The Jewish Bene Israel Graveyard remains in the larger Mewa Shah Graveyard in Karachi. ==Further reading== * \\"The Jews of Pakistan-A forgotten heritage\\", Yoel Reuben (Satamkar), Bene Israel heritage museum and genealogical research centre, 2010 * \\"So, what's your Kar-A journey into unknown India & Pakistan\\", Eliaz Reuben- Dandeker, Kammodan Mocadem Publishing house, 2018 * \\"The guide for the Bene Israel of India-culture, history and customs\\", Eliaz Reuben-Dandeker, Kammodan Mocadem Publishing house, 2019 * \\"The Jammaat-Inspiring people of the Bene Israel of India community, Eliaz Reuben-Dandeker, Kammodan Mocadem Publishing house, 2020 ==See also== * Pakistani Jews in Israel * Religion in Pakistan ==References== ==Sources== Above material is based on an article of Prof. Adil Najam of Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, published in Pakistan's newspaper The Daily Times. 1 ==External links== * Bene Israel graveyard: buried in time or conscience? * In search of Jews in Karachi * When Jews found refuge in an unlikely place: Pakistan * The Jews of Pakistan Category:Jews and Judaism in Pakistan Pakistan Jews Jews Category:Israel–Pakistan relations Category:History of the foreign relations of Pakistan ","title":"History of the Jews in Pakistan"},{"id":"7774054","text":"The New Britain boobook (Ninox odiosa), also known as the spangled boobook, New Britain hawk-owl or Russet hawk-owl, is a small owl that is endemic to New Britain, the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago in Papua New Guinea. ==Description== The New Britain boobook is a small owl that grows to a length of about . It has finely spotted chocolate-brown plumage, golden eyes and white eyebrows. Its facial disk is brown while the upper breast is marked with a wide brown band with buff or white barrings. The underparts are densely spotted brown. Its call is a series of rapidly repeated \\"whoo\\"s, starting at a low pitch which rises and becomes faster and louder. ==Distribution and habitat== This species is found in the lowlands and hills of the New Britain and New Ireland endemic bird areas at elevations of up to above sea level. It is fairly common in its small range and is nocturnal. It roosts during the day alone or in pairs in the middle to upper parts of the forest canopy. It feeds mainly on insects and small mammals. ==Conservation== Formerly classified as being a \\"Species of Least Concern\\" by the IUCN, the New Britain boobook was later suspected to be rarer than had previously been assumed because its rainforest habitat was being degraded by logging and forest clearance for conversion to oil palm plantations. Following the re-evaluation of its population size, this assumption was found to be correct and its numbers are now thought to be within the range of 15,000 to 30,000 individuals.

Bandon Dunes was designed by Scotsman David McLay Kidd, and it instantly garnered high praise. The course was one of Kidd's early efforts in designing a golf course. Since opening, the original golf course on property has been adjusted. Alterations include significant amounts of gorse removal and a rerouting of the par 3, second hole. Bandon Dunes is traditionally home to resort guest's lowest scores, thanks to its forgiving landing areas off the tee and mildly to moderately undulated green complexes. The resort's second course, Pacific Dunes, opened on July 1, 2001. Pacific Dunes was designed by Michigan architect Tom Doak, and sculpted by his design firm, Renaissance Design, Inc. Pacific Dunes also opened to glowing reviews and quickly surpassed Bandon Dunes as the highest-rated course on the property. Pacific Dunes was rated the number one resort golf course in the country in 2005 by Golfweek magazine, placing just ahead of Pebble Beach. It is ranked 8th in the best links courses ranking by Golf Magazine in 2014.The Best Links Courses in the World: Pacific Dunes - Golf Magazine The resort's third course, Bandon Trails, was designed by the team of Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw. Bandon Trails opened on June 1, 2005. Bandon Trails departs from its siblings in that no holes are routed along the Pacific Ocean. The course meanders through dunes, meadows, and forest land. Upon its opening, Golf Odyssey, the preeminent newsletter devoted to golf travel, named Bandon Dunes, The Best Place on the Planet for Golf. The fourth course, Old Macdonald (in honor of Charles Blair Macdonald), was designed by a team led by Tom Doak and Jim Urbina. It opened in June 2010. The fifth course, Bandon Preserve, is a Par-3 short course There are 13 holes on the course. It was also designed by Coore and Crenshaw, and the course opened on May 1, 2012. A more recent addition to the Bandon Dunes family, The Punchbowl, is a putting course designed by Doak and Urbina. It opened in 2014 and is adjacent to the first tee at Pacific Dunes. It has 18 holes and takes about an hour to play. The area is a collection of natural hollows. Punchbowl is a longstanding design concept by golf architects. The 18th hole at Old Macdonald shares the same principles and is aptly named \\"Punchbowl.\\" The sixth and newest course, Sheep Ranch, opened on June 1, 2020. Located to the north of Old Macdonald, it has a mile of ocean frontage over a series of promontories, with several holes featuring shots over water and cliffs. The property had been a wind farm in the 1970s, but had been abandoned because the winds proved to be too intense for turbines of that era. Resort owner Mike Keiser bought the land in 2000 along with business partner Phil Friedmann, and originally intended for it to be a private course separate from the main resort. Doak and Urbina started work on the property after completing Pacific Dunes, and had completed 13 greens before Keiser and Friedmann stopped construction once locals heard about the project, fearing that the project would cause problems for the resort. For more than 15 years, the property sat largely vacant; the greens were not irrigated, and only a select number of resort guests who asked the right individuals were allowed on the incomplete course. Eventually, Keiser and Friedmann decided to incorporate this land into the resort, and enlisted Coore and Crenshaw to design a full course. Three pairs of holes that travel in different directions share teeing areas. Use of golf carts is not permitted at the resort, unless required for medical reasons. In 2009, Golf Magazine named the three courses existing at that time to its list of the 50 best courses built in the last 50 years. Pacific Dunes ranked second, Bandon Dunes twelfth, and Bandon Trails as thirty-third. In 2013 Golf Digest ranked Bandon Dunes (Old MacDonald) fifth in its list of the Top 50 Golf Courses for Women. Golf Digest, America's Top 50 Courses for Women, July 2013 ==Tournaments held== The United States Golf Association has staged six amateur championship tournaments at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, the most recent being the 2020 U.S. Amateur. The USGA first came to Bandon Dunes in 2006, staging the Curtis Cup, a biennial women's amateur team competition between the United States and Great Britain/Ireland. The matches took place on the Pacific Dunes course, and the U.S. won 11½ to 6½. The next year, 2007, saw the resort host the U.S. Mid-Amateur Golf Championship. Bandon Dunes was the primary course for the event, with Bandon Trails used as the second course for the stroke-play portion of the event. Bandon Dunes hosted the 2011 U.S. Amateur Public Links and the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links championship tournaments. It was the first time the USGA held the men's and women's Public Links events jointly. The tournaments were played on the Old Macdonald and Bandon Trails courses. In 2015, the resort hosted the first-ever U.S. Women's Amateur Four-Ball, an event the USGA created to replace the Public Links, which was discontinued. The event was held on the Pacific Dunes course. Bandon Dunes was also the site of the 2019 U.S. Amateur Four-Ball. Old Macdonald was the primary course used for the event, with Pacific Dunes also used. In 2020, the resort hosted the U.S. Amateur Championship for the first time. Bandon Dunes was the primary course, with Bandon Trails used as the second course for the stroke-play portion of the event. Tyler Strafaci won the tournament, defeating Ollie Osborne in the final match, during which the contestants played through thick fog during the final holes. ==Scorecards== ==Gallery== image:Bandon Dunes Resort-1.jpg image:Bandon Dunes Resort-5.jpg image:Bandon Dunes Resort-2.jpg image:Bandon Dunes Resort-6.jpg image:Bandon Dunes Resort-7.jpg image:Bandon Dunes Resort-8.jpg Bandon_Dunes_-_4th_hole.jpg View_of_Bandon_Dunes_from_lodge_patio.jpg View_of_lodge_and_clubhouse_from_18th_fairway_-_Bandon_Dunes.jpg Golfer_on_the_16th_green_at_Bandon_Dunes.jpg Bandon_Preserve.jpg Golfers_on_the_16th_green_at_Bandon_Dunes.jpg Bandon_Trails_approaching_the_18th_fairway.jpg ==ReferencesAerial view from Google Maps Category:1999 establishments in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Coos County, Oregon Category:Curtis Cup venues Category:Golf clubs and courses in Oregon Category:Oregon Coast Category:Tourist attractions in Coos County, Oregon ","title":"Bandon Dunes Golf Resort"},{"id":"7774107","text":"Sulien was an 11th-century Bishop of St David's, for two periods (1073-1078 and 1079/80-1085/6).

Like its modern relatives, Ceratosuchus was a swamp-dwelling predator. It is named for the pair of flattened, triangular bony plates that extend from the back of its head. The type species is C. burdoshi, a name chosen by the Field Museum after Theodore Burdosh discovered a nearly complete skull on an expedition to Western Colorado in 1937. > \\"Fortunately, a knob of bone projecting from an otherwise undistinguished > piece of rock had caught the eye of Mr. Burdosh, and the block had been > brought to the Museum.

P. Schmidt for a skull from Colorado. Further remains, including additional skulls, mandibles, and cervical armor, was recovered from Wyoming by University of Michigan paleontologists and described by William Bartels in 1984. The skull, of a moderately-size alligatorine, is most notable for its horns, formed by expansion of the bones (squamosals) that formed the rear corners of the skull roof. These horns were bulbous and pointed up. There were five teeth in both of the bones that made up the tip of the snout (premaxilla), fifteen in the paired maxillae that formed the sides of the upper jaw, and twenty in both dentaries of the lower jaw. The front of the lower jaw had a flattened shape, and the teeth located here pointed partially forward, with a spade-like form. The teeth had variable shapes; the first thirteen teeth in the lower jaw were pointed, while the last seven graded from a spatulate shape to a large globular shape. Aside from the horns, the skull and particularly the lower jaw of Ceratosuchus were very similar to that of its contemporary Allognathosuchus. The neck armor had blade-like keels that may have been aligned with the skull horns. ==Paleobiology== Although Ceratosuchus is the only known horned alligatorine, horns are not unknown in crocodilians; similar structures are known for two species of Crocodylus, C. robustus and C. rhombifer. Bartels proposed that the horns' small size and bluntness made them unlikely weapons, and their small size also made use in a threat display unlikely. Instead, he favored their use as signals for species recognition: in this case, the horns would allow Ceratosuchus and species of Allognathosuchus to tell each other apart. Ceratosuchus is known from overbank mudstone deposits. It so far has been a rare find compared to Allognathosuchus from the same rocks. Bartels reported that only 5% of Clarkforkian crocodilians collected by the University of Michigan can be certainly assigned to Ceratosuchus (although this may be partially artificial because fragmentary specimens of Ceratosuchus could be confused with Allognathosuchus). Ceratosuchus may have been ecologically restricted in comparison to Allognathosuchus. Although the blunt posterior teeth of Allognathosuchus and Ceratosuchus have been traditionally interpreted as for feeding on mollusks or turtles, Bartels noted that these crocodilians were too small to feed on large bivalves or non-juvenile turtles, and that modern crocodilians usually swallow snails whole. Instead, he proposed that skull morphology and tooth wear better fit generalized predation on a variety of invertebrates and vertebrates. ==References== Category:Paleocene crocodylomorphs Category:Eocene crocodylomorphs Category:Paleogene reptiles of North America Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Fossil taxa described in 1938 ","title":"Ceratosuchus"},{"id":"7774144","text":"The New Ireland boobook (Ninox variegata) also known as the Bismarck hawk owl or Bismarck boobook, is a small to medium-sized owl measuring in length.

The alternate history explores a World War III scenario based on a Soviet attack on West Germany across the North German Plain, with defense provided by NATO army corps from the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Red Army is unique among military fiction published in the United States during the 1980s, as it presented the material exclusively from the perspective of officers and men in the Soviet Army. ==Plot summary== The book takes the perspective of soldiers with the Group of Soviet Forces in East Germany as they prepare to launch an invasion of West Germany. Soviet General Mikhail Malinsky, commander of the First Western Front, discusses the upcoming invasion with other Soviet leaders. The plans call for a simultaneous thrust on three fronts: across the North German Plain, through the Fulda Gap, and across Bavaria. NATO commanders are to be bluffed into thinking the main assault will come at the Fulda Gap, but the main effort will be on the North German Plain, led by Malinsky. Airborne forces will be dropped deep into West Germany to disrupt the NATO rearguard. The Soviet commanders believe that if Soviet forces are deep inside West Germany in three days, NATO will not be able to use its nuclear weapons to blunt the advance. A Soviet propaganda film about the destruction of Lueneberg (carefully produced at a Moscow studio) will be used to psychologically shock the West Germans. When the invasion begins, the Soviets advance quickly, bypassing strong points whenever possible. The successful capture of a NATO command post and a Soviet tank company's capture and shepherding of a German refugee convoy outside Hildesheim adds to the speed of movement. The West German forces positioned on the inter-German border are gradually cut off from their resupply lines, while a unit trapped in the Cuxhaven peninsula fights to the last man. Deprived of reconnaissance assets, however, Malinsky worries that the U.S. Army forces based near the Fulda Gap will come to the aid of the British, Dutch, and West German forces that he faces. Day three of the war finds the Soviets nearing the industrial Ruhr valley. Hoping to forestall a complete West German collapse, remaining NATO forces in the north, joined by the strong and relatively unbloodied U.S. Army from the south, hit Malinsky's First Western Front from all sides. It is not enough; before the NATO counterattack has a chance to succeed, the West German government asks the USSR for a cease-fire. In the aftermath, the Soviet Army occupies all of Germany east of the Rhine. ==References== Category:1989 American novels Category:Novels set during World War III Category:Novels set during the Cold War Category:American war novels Category:American alternate history novels Category:Novels set in Germany ","title":"Red Army (novel)"},{"id":"7774160","text":"\\"The Great Wall of China\\" (original title \\"Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer\\", literally At the Construction of the Great Wall of China) is a short story by Franz Kafka.

He began his training as a goldsmith's apprentice. Carrier-Belleuse was a student of David d'Angers and briefly studied at the École des Beaux-Arts. His career is distinguished by his versatility and his work outside France: in England between 1850 and 1855 (working for Mintons), and in Brussels around 1871. His name is perhaps best known because Auguste Rodin worked as his assistant between 1864 and 1870.

It was open-air with a central administration building and classrooms extending out in a series of parallel wings to take advantage of the Florida weather by providing maximum natural light and exposure for each classroom. In July 1953, the school board chose Boca Ciega (after the nearby bay) as the school's name over Gulfport, Sunshine City, Sun City, Central, Gulf Coast, 58th Street, and Southwest St. Petersburg.

It first aired on November 30, 2006 in the United States on NBC. The episode was the series' only original script written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who are the creators of the original British comedy series of the same name. It was directed by Jeffrey Blitz, his first such credit of the series. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton and Stamford branches of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) discovers that an employee named Martin Nash (Wayne Wilderson), who came with the branches' recent merger, was previously in prison. Michael becomes frustrated when Martin's stories of prison sound better than working in the office. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) plays a prank on Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) by giving incorrect information to Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) on how to impress her. According to Nielsen Media Research, an estimated 9.07 million viewers watched \\"The Convict\\" on its first broadcast, making it up to that point the largest audience of the season. Among adults aged 18 to 49, it earned a 4.4/11 ratings share, finishing in eighteenth place for the week among all the major networks. Television critics were largely positive towards the episode, particularly Carell's \\"Prison Mike\\" sequence as well as Helms' performance as Andy Bernard. ==Synopsis== Michael Scott (Steve Carell) learns that black employee Martin Nash (Wayne Wilderson) is a former criminal, and tells the entire office. During this time, in a misguided effort to avoid issues of stereotyping and racism Michael asks the employees to name a white person that they trust and he will name a black person he trusts even more. The name Jesus pops up and Michael replies with Apollo Creed. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) encourages Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to pursue Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes. Later, Andy strums \\"Rainbow Connection\\" on his banjo while singing falsetto. Pam smiles politely and silently shares the joke with Jim. Martin tells the others he was incarcerated for insider trading, and that he enjoyed certain perks of prison, including outside time and art classes. Pam comments that prison sounds better than their current work situation. Attempting to convince his employees that the office is better than prison, Michael sends everyone to \\"outside time\\" in the bitter cold. He then calls a meeting in which he adopts the persona of \\"Prison Mike.\\" Martin comments that Michael's performance did not remind him of his time in prison. This further infuriates Michael, who then locks all of the staff inside the conference room. In order to have his co-workers released, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Michael the staff is simply teasing him. After letting the agitated workers go, a relieved Michael relents, but Martin chooses to quit. ==Production== \\"The Convict\\" was written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the co-creators of the British comedy series of the same name. It was their first and only original script for the American series, after years of creator and executive producer Greg Daniels imploring them to participate. Gervais and Merchant had refused previously because they believed that the American show should be written by Americans, and only changed their minds after watching the second season. Gervais first worried that he was too unfamiliar with office protocol in the United States, noting that he \\"knew everything about this place (in England), the pitfalls, the dos and don'ts. Whereas in America, I don't know if I'm getting it right or not.\\" Despite this, his script writing went \\"remarkably fast. I suppose that's because we'd been away from those characters for two or three years. It's one of our favorite shows, the American Office.\\" Gervais and Merchant spent several days debating phrasing and language, leading them to a point where they felt they had \\"translated it pretty well\\" for American viewers. \\"The Convict\\" was the first Office episode to be directed by Jeffrey Blitz, who later won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for the fifth season episode \\"Stress Relief\\" in 2009. In a departure from series routine, Gervais and Merchant were not present on set for much of filming, though episode writers had typically been available in the past. Actress Kate Flannery found the episode \\"a lot of fun to shoot,\\" and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, \\"it seems to me like he is looking at all of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent.\\" One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office. The third season DVD contains several scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the episode. These include Dwight and Andy verbally sparring in the kitchen, Dwight informing Michael that he believes Martin has murdered Meredith, Michael explaining that he created \\"Prison Mike\\" in an improvisation class, and Pam giving Andy wildly incorrect tips for hanging out with Jim. ==Reception== Ed Helms was singled out for praise by television critics \\"The Convict\\" was first broadcast on NBC in the United States on November 30, 2006, near the end of the fall sweeps period. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by an estimated 9.07 million viewers, the highest number of the series' season up to that point. The episode earned a 4.4/11 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 4.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds watching television at the time of broadcast. Among that demographic, The Office finished in eighteenth place for the week among all of the major networks. Eric Goldman of IGN rated \\"The Convict\\" 9 out of 10, an indication of an \\"amazing\\" episode. He wrote that \\"while this wouldn't qualify as one of the very best episodes of the series, the great news is, Gervais and Merchant did an excellent job, working very well within the same-but-different world the US version of the show has created, and delivering some of the biggest and best laughs of the season.\\" Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald however was more critical of the episode, explaining that \\"Carell is a fearless actor, but he can't stop a train wreck. The B-story is better, as Jim decides to prank Pam by coaching Andy on just the wrong way to woo the receptionist. The Office has been erratic all season, but even at its worst, it's still the best comedy on television.\\" Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought \\"The Convict\\" seemed different from previous episodes, citing as evidence the scene of Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: \\"I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed a little different than the others.\\" Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, \\"When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton.\\" Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed \\"the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode.\\" She also praised Helms for \\"prov[ing] once again how perfectly he fits in on this show as he is absolutely hysterical.\\" Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West was pleased with the Jim-Karen storyline and called it \\"a nice, normal progression for two single people who are into each other.\\" She also praised Jim's prank on Pam, especially viewing Helms' performance \\"amazingly funny as this oblivious blowhard.\\" Referring to \\"Michael's earnest determination not to assume that Martin was the ex-con whom the Stamford office had hired,\\" West found the episode to be a satire of \\"white liberal guilt\\". Reviewers were also positive towards the \\"Prison Mike\\" sequence, with West calling it \\"a dead-on impersonation of a badass convict.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A-\\". ==References== ==External links== *\\"The Convict\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2006 American television episodes Category:The Office (American season 3) episodes ","title":"The Convict"},{"id":"7774484","text":"MTV Finland is a music channel broadcasting to the Finnish speaking market.

He attended school in both Minnesota and Maryland before attending the Maryland Agricultural College. ==Career== Squiers joined the Army in 1877 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and attended the United States Artillery School. In 1880 he was transferred from the First Infantry Regiment to the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment. In October 1885, while still a member of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment, he reported for duty at St. John's College (now known as Fordham University) in New York, as the school's first Professor of Military Science and Tactics. He trained and outfitted an impressive Corps of Cadets, the predecessor of today's Army ROTC program at Fordham. In December 1890, he left the college and returned to the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment on detached service at Fort Leavenworth to appear before a board for promotion to First Lieutenant. He returned to the regiment 4 January 1891, about a week after the Battle of Wounded Knee. Troop K took heavy losses during the battle and Captain Wallace (a survivor of the Little Big Horn) and five troopers were killed and 10 wounded. Squiers took command of Troop K but shortly thereafter he resigned and left the Army early in 1891. ===Diplomatic service=== He entered U.S. diplomatic service and first served as Second Secretary of the American Embassy in Berlin in 1894. He retired in 1897, then was appointed secretary of the American Legation in Pekin (Beijing) in 1898. He was appointed as Minister to Cuba in May, 1902 and served until November 1905. There was growing opposition to his policies as Minister, including his support for a group of U.S. citizens encamped in the Isle of Pines who sought to organize a territorial government leading to the annexation of Cuba to the U.S. He resigned under pressure. From 1906 until 1909 he served as Minister to Panama. ===Looting controversy=== Squiers was a noted collector of fine porcelain, and had previously collected porcelain during vacations in Japan.

On 7 March 1901, the United States Minister to China, Edwin Hurd Conger (1843–1907), sent a cable to John Hay, the United States Secretary of State, that exonerated Squiers completely of looting: \\"the reports that have reached America to the effect that H.G.

Squiers left Beijing on 2 September 1901 \\"with what was reported to be several railway cars filled with Chinese art,\\" which Squiers indicated was to be donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York city.Hevia, Lessons, 217.

It is named for its unusually short skull. Fully grown individuals were about in length. The type species is Simosuchus clarki, found from the Maevarano Formation in Mahajanga Province, although some fossils have been found in India. The teeth of S. clarki were shaped like maple leaves, which coupled with its short and deep snout suggests it was not a carnivore like most other crocodylomorphs. In fact, these features have led many palaeontologists to consider it a herbivore. ==Description== Life restoration of S. clarki Simosuchus was small, about long based on the skeletons of mature individuals. In contrast to most other crocodyliforms, which have long, low skulls, Simosuchus has a distinctively short snout. The snout resembles that of a pug, giving the genus its name, which means \\"pug- nosed crocodile\\" in Greek. The shape of skulls differs considerably between specimens, with variation in ornamentation and bony projections. These differences may be indications of sexual dimorphism. The front (preorbita) portion of the skulll is angled downwards. Simosuchus likely held its head so that the preorbital area was angled about 45° from horizontal. The teeth line the front of the jaws and are shaped like maple leaves. At the back of the skull, the occipital condyle (which articulates with the neck vertebrae) is downturned. 45 autapomorphies, or features unique to Simosuchus, can be found in the skull alone. Size comparison to a human In most respects, the postcranial skeleton of Simosuchus resembles that of other terrestrial crocodyliforms. There are several differences, however, that have been used to distinguish it from related forms. The scapula is broad and tripartite (three- pronged). On its surface, there is a laterally directed prominence. The deltopectoral crest, a crest on the upper end of the humerus, is small. The glenohumeral condyle of the humerus, which connects to the pectoral girdle in the shoulder joint, has a distinctive rounded ellipsoid shape. The limbs are robust. The radius and ulna of the forearm fit tightly together. The front feet are small with large claws, and the back feet are also reduced in size. There is a small crest along the anterior edge of the femur. On the pelvis, the anterior process of the ischium is spur-like. Most of the spinal column of Simosuchus is known. There are eight cervical vertebrae in the neck, at least fifteen dorsal vertebrae in the back, two sacral vertebrae at the hip, and no more than twenty caudal vertebrae in the tail. The number of vertebrae in the tail is less than that of most crocodyliforms, giving Simosuchus a very short tail. Like other crocodyliforms, Simosuchus was covered in bony plates called osteoderms. These form shields over the back, underside, and tail. Unusually among crocodyliforms, Simosuchus also has osteoderms covering much of the limbs. Osteoderms covering the back, tail, and limbs are light and porous, while the osteoderms covering the belly are plate-like and have an inner structure resembling spongy diploë. Simosuchus has a tetraserial paravertebral shield over its back, meaning that there are four rows of tightly locking paramedial osteoderms (osteoderms to either side of the midline of the back). To either side of the shield, there are four rows of accessory parasagittal osteoderms. These accessory osteoderms tightly interlock with one another. ==History== Skull of Simosuchus clarki in the Field Museum of Natural History The first specimen of Simosuchus clarki, which served as the basis for its initial description in 2000, included a complete skull and lower jaw, the front of the postcranial skeleton, and parts of the posterior postcranial skeleton. Five more specimens were later described, representing the majority of the skeleton. Many isolated teeth have also been found in the Mahajanga Basin. Most remains of Simosuchus were found as part of the Mahajanga Basin Project, directed by the Université d'Antananarivo and Stony Brook University. Material was usually found in clays that were part of flow deposits in the Anembalemba Member of the Maevarano Formation. ==Classification== {border=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\" Cladograms of Notosuchia -  -  } Simosuchus was first considered to be a basal member of the clade Notosuchia, and was often considered to be closely related to Uruguaysuchus from the Late Cretaceous of Uruguay and Malawisuchus from the Early Cretaceous of Malawi. Later phylogenetic studies have placed it closer to the genus Libycosuchus and in a more derived position than some other notosuchians such as Uruguaysuchus. In its initial description by Buckley et al. (2000), Simosuchus was placed in the family Notosuchidae. Its sister taxon was Uruguaysuchus, and the two were allied with Malawisuchus. These taxa were placed in Notosuchidae along with Libycosuchus and Notosuchus. Most of the following phylogenetic analyses resulted in a similar placement of Simosuchus and other genera within Notosuchia. Turner and Calvo (2005) also found a clade including Simosuchus, Uruguaysuchus, and Malawisuchus in their study. The phylogenetic analysis of Carvalho et al. (2004), based on different character values than previous studies, produced a very different relationship among Simosuchus and other notosuchians. Simosuchus, along with Uruguaysuchus and Comahuesuchus, were placed outside Notosuchia. Simosuchus was found to be the sister taxon of the Chinese genus Chimaerasuchus in the family Chimaerasuchidae. Like Simosuchus, Chimaerasuchus has a short snout and was probably herbivorous. Both genera were placed outside Notosuchia in the larger clade Gondwanasuchia. Uruguaysuchus, previously considered to be a basal notosuchian and a close relative of Simosuchus, was placed in its own family, Uruguaysuchidae, also outside Notosuchia. Malawisuchus was found to be a member of Peirosauroidea, specifically a member of the family Itasuchidae. The following cladogram simplified after a comprehensive analysis of notosuchians which focused on Simosuchus clarki presented by Alan H. Turner and Joseph J. W. Sertich in 2010. * _Note_ : Based on a specimen that was reassigned from Peirosaurus. ==Paleobiology== Profile view of skull FMNH PR 2597 Simosuchus, like other notosuchians, was fully terrestrial. The short tail would have had little use in swimming. The osteoderm shield was inflexible, restricting lateral movement in Simosuchus as a possible adaptation to an entirely terrestrial lifestyle. Robust legs are also consistent with terrestrial locomotion. The deltopectoral crest on the humerus and the anterior crest on the femur served as attachment points for strong limb muscles. The hindlimbs of Simosuchus were semierect, unlike the fully erect posture of most other notosuchians. Simosuchus was probably a herbivore; its complex dentition resembles that of herbivorous iguanids. A fossorial, or burrowing lifestyle, for Simosuchus has recently been proposed but is not widely agreed upon. Evidence for burrowing includes the robust limbs and short snout, which appears shovel-like. There are also areas on the skull that may have attached to strong neck muscles that would have been well suited for burrowing. ===Paleobiogeography=== It is unknown how Simosuchus arrived in Madagascar. A similar crocodyliform, Araripesuchus tsangatsangana, is also known from the Maevarano Formation, but its relation to Simosuchus is unclear. It has been classified as both a notosuchian and a basal neosuchian in various phylogenetic analyses. Nearly all notosuchians are known from Gondwana, the southern supercontinent that existed throughout much of the Mesozoic and encompassed South America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica. Libycosuchus, regarded as one of the closest relatives of Simosuchus, lived in Egypt. Unresolved relationships among notosuchians along with an incomplete fossil record have made it difficult to determine the biogeographic origins of Simosuchus. ==References== ==External links== *Mikko's Phylogenic Archives *Digimorph Entry Category:Late Cretaceous crocodylomorphs Category:Terrestrial crocodylomorphs Category:Crocodylomorphs of Madagascar Category:Maevarano fauna Category:Ziphosuchians Category:Maastrichtian life ","title":"Simosuchus"},{"id":"7774495","text":"A Tale of Two Cities is a 1946 propaganda/documentary film about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, produced by the Army-Navy Screen Magazine. The film chronologically, and for the most part, neutrally, describes the testing and the use of the atomic bombs impact on Hiroshima, describing where the bomb was actually dropped, and the damage done to military industrial targets, as well as noting which edifices sustained less damage, like those built with reinforced concrete. An interview is shown with a Jesuit priest, who describes his experience, and notes that he believes that approximately 100,000 people died. Then the film moves on to Nagasaki, telling the audience that U.S. President Harry S. Truman warned the Japanese that he would use more nukes if they didn't surrender. The Nagasaki mission is described, showing the two plants that were the basic targets, and the valley that they planned to bomb, and then shows the mushroom cloud, \\"The baptism of the aggressor nation\\".

He was accepted in Sofia Military School and volunteered to serve in a reserve regiment during the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885. He took part in the 1886 coup d'état against prince Alexander Batenberg. After the plot failed he was demoted to the rank of cadet and sent to serve in the 12th infantry regiment. Soon after he received an amnesty for his offence and graduated from the Military School. In 1887 he was promoted to Lieutenant and assigned to the 2nd artillery regiment in Shumen. In 1894 he was promoted to captain and sent to Italy where in 1898 he graduated the military academy of Turin. After his return to Bulgaria he served in the 3rd artillery regiment and in the Army's staff. In 1901 he was promoted to major and taught at the Sofia military school, becoming its headmaster in 1912. Between 1910 and 1912 he also served as commander of the 1st infantry regiment. ===Balkan Wars=== During the First Balkan War, Colonel Zhekov served as chief of staff of the 2nd Army which was tasked with the initial siege and latter the storming of the important fortress of Edirne.He contracted an illness which prevented him from taking part in the Second Balkan War and after it was assigned commander of the Bulgarian forces in Western Thrace. In 1913-1914 Zhekov was also part of a Bulgarian diplomatic mission to Istanbul, which was involved in negotiating a military convention between Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. After that he served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Bulgarian Army and commander of the 8th \\"Tundzha\\" division. In August 1915 he was promoted to major general and appointed Minister of War. ===First World War=== Lt. Gen. Zhekov as commander-in-chief After his experience of the Balkan Wars Tsar Ferdinand refused to take command of the Bulgarian Army as Commander-in-Chief and personally favored Nikola Zhekov for the post, which he assumed on 24 September 1915. Zhekov was a proponent for the military intervention of Bulgaria in the war on the side of the Central Powers and led the Bulgarian Army until the end of the war. Attached to Mackensen's Army Group, the Bulgarian First Army liaised with the Germany and Austria-Hungary in crushing the Serbian army at home while the Bulgarian Second Army, which remained under direct Bulgarian control, seized Macedonia and defeated the Entente relief effort. Under Mackensen's command, the Bulgarian Army also participated in the militarily highly successful Romanian Campaign. Separately, Zhekov managed in throwing back the Allied offensives in Salonika in the autumn of 1916 and the spring of 1917 at the Battles of Florina and Lake Prespa. Zhekov's forces also participated in the successful attack against the port of Kavalla in August–September 1916. On 6 October 1916 he was promoted to lieutenant general. In the summer of 1918 he became ill and on 8 September was forced to go to Vienna for medical treatment, leaving the command of the army to the deputy commander-in-chief general Georgi Todorov. It was during this critical time when an Entente offensive in Macedonia managed to break the Bulgarian lines at Dobro Pole and lead to the capitulation of Bulgaria. On 4 November 1918 lieutenant general Nikola Zhekov was discharged from the active army and went into the reserve. ===Later life=== After the war Zhekov chose to flee into exile in Germany. He returned in 1921 to defend his reputation and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment but was granted pardon after spending three years in jail. In the years after that Zhekov read lectures in the Military Academy and wrote several books regarding the military science and his memoirs. On 6 May 1936 he was promoted to general of the infantry, which was the highest rank in the Bulgarian Army. During World War II General Zhekov established a friendly relationship with Adolf Hitler and following the defeat of France in 1940 he was invited by the Führer to visit Paris as his guest. After the government changes in September 1944 General Zhekov, fearing political persecutions, decided to immigrate to Germany. On 1 February 1945 he was sentenced to death by the People's Court established by the communist government of the Fatherland Front. However, his whereabouts were unknown to the government and the sentence couldn't be carried out. Zhekov died on 1 November 1949 in the Bavarian town of Füssen. On 7 November 1992 his remains were returned to Bulgaria and were laid to rest in the Military Mausoleum in Sofia. ==Awards== *Order of Bravery, II grade and III grade,2 class *Order of St Alexander, I grade with swords and Great Cross of the Order without swords *Order of Military Merit, IV and V grade *German Pour le Mérite, *German Iron Cross, I and II class *German Order of the Red Eagle, Grand Cross and 2nd Class *German Saxe-Ernestine House Order, *German Order of the Württemberg Crown, *Austro-Hungarian Order of the Iron Crown, II class *Austro-Hungarian Order of Leopold, I class *Austro-Hungarian Military Merit Cross, I class with War Decoration *Ottoman Order of Osmanieh, I class *Ottoman War Medal (\\"Iron Crescent\\"), *Ottoman Imtiyaz Medal in gold and in silver ==See also== * Balkans Campaign (World War I) ==References== * First World War.com - Who's Who - Nikola Zhekov at www.firstworldwar.com * Енциклопедия „България“, том 2, Издателство на БАН, София, 1981. * Недев, С., Командването на българската войска през войните за национално обединение, София, 1993, Военноиздателски комплекс „Св.

He is recognized \\"as one of the most brilliant Haitian writers,\\" and has produced a significant body of poetry to his credit. He also served as Haiti's ambassador to Argentina. ==Early years== Brierre was born in Jérémie and was the son of Fernand Brierre and Henriette Desrouillère. He descended from a French settler, François Brierre, who had bought at auction, in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) a black Dahomean woman, named Rosette, sister of Marie-Cssette Dumas, who also gave birth to the general Thomas- Alexandre Dumas in Jérémie, who later fathered great French novelist, Alexandre Dumas. ==Career== Brierre became the Director of École normale de Chatard of rural teachers in 1928 at age nineteen. Brierre was appointed thereafter, at 21, as Secretary of Legation in Paris where he took courses in political science. In 1931, he began studying law and completed his courses in 1935. He was head of Cultural Division of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Director of the Tourism Bureau and then Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Tourism. Brierre was also member of the Government Council and was named Ambassador of Haiti to Buenos Aires. Brierre worked as a politician and diplomat. He emerged in the 1930s as a poet and militant in the backlash against the United States occupation of Haiti (1915–34). His epic verse celebrated the heroes of Haitian independence and the black race. His Black Soul (1947) and La Source (1956) are well-known Haitian examples of the poetry of négritude. In 1932, Brierre founded the newspaper \\"La Bataille\\", where its criticism against the regime of Stenio Vincent and the American occupation earned him two years of closed detention in the national penitentiary. Brierre was also an educator and diplomat until his exile in 1962, after nine months of prison under the regime of François Duvalier. He lived most of his exile in Senegal, and returned to Haiti after the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier, the son. Brierre died in Port-au-Prince on the night of December 24 to 25, 1992, at the age of 83.

It has many caves with very cool air inside. Unlike many caves, these were formed by subaerial weathering rather than dissolution, and as a result have a highly distinctive shape. The mountain attracts many people especially from nearby villages, and has been targeted for additional tourist development. Although there are no other hills for a considerable distance, Jabl Al-Qarah is an outlier of the larger Shedgum Plateau. The caves, which include 28 tall linear passageways totaling in length, have long been a site of commerce.

Parapapio is distinguished from other Papio by the lack of an anteorbital drop, thin browridges, absence of maxillary fossae or a sagittal crest and only slight sexual dimorphism. There are four recognized species, Pp. jonesi, Pp. whitei, Pp. broomi, and Pp. lothagamensis, but these taxonomic designations have generated some controversy. Traditionally, these species have been distinguished based on molar size with Pp. jonesi being the smallest and Pp. whitei the largest. However, variation in molar size in Pp. broomi overlaps the other two. Pp. jonesi is distinguished as having a more squarish muzzle than Pp. whitei but more rounded than Pp. broomi; however these distinctions are subtle and better diagnostic criteria are needed. Some authors argue for a confused taxonomy in Parapapio but disagree with the reclassification. Since there may be no significant difference between mean tooth sizes or isotopic signatures in Pp. broomi and Pp. jonesi, these may represent a single sexually dimorphic species. However, the ranges of variation in Pp. broomi and Pp. whitei overlap and show no statistical differences based on an ANOVA run on the eleven interlandmark distances used in their analysis, and propose that the two are merely a single variable species. The sample of Pp. jonesi (STS 565) differs enough in facial characteristics that it remains distinctive from other Parapapio species. ==References== ==External links== *Mikko's Phylogeny Archive *Proctor, Darby.

Her marriage to Commodus did not produce an heir, and her husband was instead succeeded by Pertinax. ==Family== Crispina came from an illustrious aristocratic family and was the daughter of twice consul Gaius Bruttius Praesens and his wife Valeria. Crispina’s paternal grandparents were consul and senator Gaius Bruttius Praesens and the rich heiress Laberia Hostilia Crispina, daughter of another twice consul, Manius Laberius Maximus. Crispina's brother was future consul Lucius Bruttius Quintius Crispinus. Her father’s family originally came from Volceii, Lucania, Italy and were closely associated with the Roman Emperors Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. Crispina was born and raised in Rome or Volceii. ==Marriage== Crispina married the sixteen-year-old Commodus in the summer of 178 and brought him, as a dowry, a large number of estates. These, when added to the Imperial holdings, gave him control of a substantial part of Lucanian territory. The actual ceremony was modest but was commemorated on coinage, and largesse was distributed to the people. An epithalamium for the occasion was composed by the sophist Julius Pollux. Upon her marriage, Crispina received the title of Augusta, and thus became empress of the Roman Empire, as her husband was co-emperor with her father-in-law at the time. The previous empress and her mother-in-law, Faustina the Younger had died three years prior to her arrival. Like most marriages of young members of the nobiles, it was arranged by patres—in Crispina's case by her father and her new father-in-law, the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Crispina is described as being a graceful person with a susceptible heart. As Augusta, Crispina was extensively honoured with public images during the last two years of her father-in-law's reign and the initial years of her husband's reign. She did not seem to have any significant political influence over her husband during his bizarre reign. However, she was not exempted from court politics either, as her sister-in-law Lucilla, herself a former empress, was reportedly ambitious and jealous of the reigning empress Crispina due to her position and power. Crispina's marriage failed to produce an heir due to her husband's inability, which led to a dynastic succession crisis. In fact, both Lucius Antistius Burrus (with whom Commodus had shared his first consulate as sole ruler) and Gaius Arrius Antoninus, who were probably related to the imperial family, were allegedly put to death 'on the suspicion of pretending to the throne'. After ten years of marriage, Crispina was falsely charged with adultery by her husband and was banished to the island of Capri in 188, where she was later executed. After her banishment, Commodus did not marry again but took on a mistress, a woman named Marcia, who was later said to have conspired in his murder. ==Death== Empress Bruttia Crispina, draped bust On the basis of a misreading of HA Commodus 5.9 and Dio 73.4.6, her fall is sometimes wrongly associated with Lucilla's conspiracy to assassinate Commodus in 181 or 182. Her name continues to appear in inscriptions until as late as 191 (). Her eventual exile and death may instead have been a result of the fall of Marcus Aurelius Cleander, or of Commodus's inability to produce offspring with her to ensure the dynastic succession. ==References== ==External sources== * Bruttia Crispina, livius.org, 2007.

National Estuarine Research Reserve System overview of Rookery Bay, website accessed on 4 Nov 2006 The Rookery Bay and Ten Thousand Islands ecosystem is a prime example of a nearly pristine subtropical mangrove forested estuary. Rookery Bay Reserve is located in the West Florida subregion of the West Indian Biogeographic Region. ==History== A 10-mile loop road through Rookery Bay was proposed in 1963. The road would have facilitated vast coastal development around Rookery Bay, but a new perspective emerged in the community With the help of the Collier County Conservancy, the Nature Conservancy, the Collier Audubon Society, and a number of private investors, a grass roots effort resulted in the purchase of 3,362 acres. This acreage eventually became the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Sanctuary, with official designation by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1980. Shortly thereafter, the name was changed to Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. Aerial view of an island in Rookery Bay ==Environmental Learning Center== The Environmental Learning Center is a 16,500 square-foot building with four research laboratories, two classrooms and an auditorium, and a two story visitor center. The Visitor Center has a variety of hands-on experiences, including a large 2,300-gallon aquarium and interactive displays addressing research and stewardship efforts within the Reserve. A nature store, art gallery and picnic area are other amenities within the Environmental Learning Center. ==Coastal Training Program== The Coastal Training Program educates working professionals to find environmental-friendly solutions for environmental issues. Fertilizer runoff is a recurring event in Southwest Florida and this program's objective is to deter any activity that will harm the local environment. Training, field education, and networking are benefits that the working professionals will receive through Coastal Training in partnership between Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Collier County, University of Florida/IFAS Collier County Extension Office, Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and the City of Naples. ==Friends of Rookery Bay== The Friends of Rookery Bay (FORB) is a non-profit organization that supports Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve's fundraising goals. FORB addresses the challenges that the Reserve faces for its coastal land and water management. Volunteer events, outreach efforts, and fund- raising programs are a few of the many ways that FORB helps Rookery Bay. FORB also assists the Environmental Learning Center by maintaining store inventory, tour-guiding boat and kayak trips, and informing the community of ethical stewardship. ==Activities== ===Volunteers=== Hundreds of Rookery Bay volunteers play an important role in the preservation, restoration and management of our estuaries in the donation of over 18,000 hours each year. Many of Rookery Bay's research and resource management projects are completed by the assistance of many dedicated volunteers. ===Student events=== Rookery Bay teaches approximately 3,000 students each year. Many students are educated through field trips where they have the opportunity to have hands-on experience. One of the programs-Estuary Explorers- is organized for fourth- grade students in Collier County. This educational program involves classroom research, hands-on activities, and teacher training workshops. Another program, Rookery Bay SURVIVORS, is organized for seventh-grade students. Rookery Bay SURVIVORS engages students and teachers with the region's coastal and estuarine environment. The activities in this program allows students to utilize critical thinking skills, in-depth questioning, and scientific processes. ===Stewardship=== Reserve resource managers facilitate land acquisition, conduct habitat and hydrology restoration projects, eradicate and control invasive plants and animals, protect listed species, respond to marine mammal strandings, manage important habitats and conduct prescribed fires to sustain native biodiversity. ====Team OCEAN==== Team OCEAN is a volunteer program- partnered between Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Florida Sea Grant, and other community contributors- that follows the model set at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The Team OCEAN volunteers frequently visit areas in the Reserve where people make a recurring visit. Team OCEAN ensures that boaters are practicing ethical procedures and are aware of \\"Leave-No-Trace\\" guidelines. Additionally, the volunteers also clean the waste that are left by negligent boaters which influence other boaters to pick up after themselves. The efforts from Team OCEAN help Rookery Bay uphold its pristine environment. Team OCEAN navigating the waters ====Tours==== Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve offers guided boat and kayak tours. The small boat tours- with a maximum capacity of six passengers per boat- offer a firsthand and personal experience. These tours are led by the Rookery Bay Reserve staff and each have a different theme. The boat tours are offered seasonally: November through April. The kayak tours offer a more independent experience; visitors can paddle as fast or slow as they would like while being led by the tour guide. These tours are offered from November through May. ==Research== Researchers from wide arrays of wildlife specializations study at Rookery Bay. The work from the researchers allows the Reserve to overlook its resources with the information gathered from the scientists. Current researchers are conducting research on the invasive Burmese pythons, native box turtles, invasive downy rose myrtle and the history of devastating hurricanes in Southwest Florida. Rookery Bay has various facilities –laboratories (dry and wet) and dorms- to aid the researchers that travel from around the world. ==See also== *National Estuarine Research Reserve *Conservancy of Southwest Florida ==References== ==External links== *Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve - official site Category:National Estuarine Research Reserves of the United States Category:Wetlands of Florida Category:Bays of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico Category:Estuaries of Florida Category:Museums in Collier County, Florida Category:Natural history museums in Florida Category:Buildings and structures in Naples, Florida Category:Protected areas of Florida Category:Protected areas of Collier County, Florida Category:Education in Collier County, Florida Category:National Estuarine Research Reserves of Florida Category:Nature centers in Florida Category:Landforms of Collier County, Florida Category:1980 establishments in Florida Category:Protected areas established in 1980 ","title":"Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve"},{"id":"7774750","text":"Mundo de Fieras (English title:World of Beasts) is a Venezuelan telenovela written by Ligia Lezama for Venevisión.

He received his B.Tech. (Electrical Engineering) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and PhD from the University of Maine. He has been a faculty member at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras since 1981, where he is currently Institute Professor. During his career, he has contributed extensively to technology innovation and adoption in the Indian context. ==Early life== Ashok Jhunjhunwala was born in Kolkata on 22 June 1953 in a Marwari family. His grandfather was a Gandhian and a close associate of Vinoba Bhave, working with Mahatma Gandhi. He studied in St Lawrence High School in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) in India, completing the Higher Secondary examination in 1970. He did his B.Tech degree from IIT Kanpur and MS and PhD from University of Maine, USA and was a faculty member at Washington State University. ==Academic career== Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala’s first appointment was in Washington State University, USA from 1979 to 1980. Prof. Jhunjhunwala then joined IIT Madras in 1981 in the Department of Electrical Engineering. His research areas include Optical Communication, Computer Networks, Wireless Communication, Decentralized(DC) Solar and Electric Vehicles, where he has significantly contributed in various dimensions. Over the last few decades he has looked at cost and affordability of various components of the telecommunications and the Internet network, especially in the Indian context. He has worked on techniques to enable communication networks to reach remote parts of rural India. In recent times, he has made some significant contributions in Solar-DC and in battery systems for Electric Vehicles. He has guided more than 70 M.S. and Ph.D. students. Over the course of his career Jhunjhunwala has served as Chairman and member of various government committees. He has been on boards of several private companies and educational institutions in the country. He was on the boards of the State Bank of India, Bharat Electronics Ltd, Hindustan Teleprinters Limited, NRDC, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), VSNL and BSNL as well as Tata Communications, Mahindra Electric, Sasken, Tejas Networks, Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd, Intellect and Exicom. As of 2020 he is on the board of Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and is the Chairman of Technology Advisory Committee of SEBI. In 2017 - 18, Jhujhunwala was on sabbatical from IITM, serving as the Principal Advisor to the Ministry of Power in the Government of India, and the Ministry of Railways in the Government of India, New Delhi. == Contributions in technology innovation and adoption == === Industry-Academia Intervention and Incubation === When Dr. Jhunjhunwala joined IIT Madras in 1981, as an academician he observed that there was not enough interaction between industry and academic institutions. Industries did not invest in R&D; of their own and preferred to import knowledge and technology. This resulted in unaffordable products and services which were available to only a section of the society. He recognized that if products and services were to be used by the bulk of Indian Society they had to be made affordable. His idea was to develop technology in-house by mutual participation of both academia and industry. To further this objective Dr. Jhunjhunwala initiated the setting up of the IITM Research Park, adjacent to the IITM campus. The 1.2 million sqft space today has about 60 R&D; centres of industries, working closely with IITM, thus creating an eco-system where faculty, students and industry professionals interact in a formal and informal manner. He believes that such interaction is the key to technological innovations and entrepreneurship. Prof Jhunjhunwala's approach of collaboration of with industry has resulted in development and adoption of technology at the grass-roots level. === Innovation in Telecom Networks === In the mid 90's his work on development of the corDECT Wireless Local Loop (WLL) allowed India to move to wireless communication systems at much lower cost. Both the capital and operational cost were significantly lower than those of any technologies prevalent at that point of time. corDECT enables wireless access solution for telecom networks with integration of both voice and Internet services. He was conferred the Padma Shri in 2002 for his work on Wireless Communication Systems. His other initiatives like setting up of the Centre for Excellence in Wireless Technology (CEWiT) and the Telecom Standards Development Society of India (TSDSI) have enabled India to export IPR in telecom. === Innovation in Electric Vehicles === Since 2016, Prof Jhunjhunwala is leading the efforts of bringing EVs in the country. He mentors several startups and groups to develop new batteries and EV models. He aims to make Electric Vehicles affordable. This will reduce India's import bill of oil and promote a greener technology. He has come up with various innovations such as reducing the size of batteries, battery swapping, using environment friendly zero–effluent recycling of spent Li-ion batteries which have resulted in significant enhancements in energy efficiencies of EVs . === Innovation in Solar Decentralization === Since about 2010, Dr Jhunjhunwala has focused his research on the power problems of India which affect the masses. He developed solar roof-top and DC power-line at home along with the use of DC-powered appliances as an answer to these problems. This innovative technique reduces power consumption. ==Awards and Honours== *Padma Shri, India, 2002: distinguished service in science and engineering, telecommunications *Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award, India, 1998: for outstanding contributions in the field of Engineering Sciences *JC Bose Fellowship, India, 2010 * Member, National Academy of Engineering, USA, 2018: innovation and development of affordable technology solutions in communications and energy *Fellow, IEEE, USA, 2009 *Fellow, Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS), India, January 2007: Engineering & Technology *Fellow, Indian National Science Academy (INSA), New Delhi, India, 1999 *Fellow, National Academy of Sciences, India, 1999 * Fellow, Indian National Academy of Engineering (INAE), India, 1994 * Lifetime achievement award by TiE * Dronacharya award by The IndUS Entrepreneurs (TiE), Chennai, November 2011 * Silicon India Leadership Award 2001 for Excellence and promise in Business & Technology Academics * Bernard Lown Humanitarian Award, 2009 * Fellow Wireless World Research Forum, 2007 * Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Lecture Award, Indian National Science Academy (INSA), India, 2006 * 27th IETE Ram Lal Wadhwa Gold Medal by the Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers, India, September 2004: outstanding contribution in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering in the broadband sense, during the last ten years *Om Prakash Bhasin Award, India, 2004: Science & Technology *UGC Hari Om Ashram Trust Award by University Grants Commission, India, 2003: Outstanding Social Scientists for interaction between Science and Science and Society *H.K.Firodia Award, India, 2002: for excellence in Science and Technology *Millennium Medal by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, during Indian Science Congress, January 2000 *Distinguished Alumnus Award by IIT Kanpur, India, September 1999 * Copper Excellence Award for Technology Innovation * Dr.Vikram Sarabhai Research Award, India, 1997: towards the contributions and achievements in the field of Electronics, Informatics, Telematics and Automation ==References== ==External links== *Biography of Dr. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, TeNeT Group, IIT- Madras *Biography of Dr. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Department of Electrical Engineering,, IIT-Madras *The Rediff Interview/Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala Category:Indian academics Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in science & engineering Category:1953 births Category:Rajasthani people Category:Living people Category:Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur alumni Category:Recipients of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Engineering Science ","title":"Ashok Jhunjhunwala"},{"id":"7774776","text":"Ronald D. Rotunda (February 14, 1945 – March 14, 2018) was a U.S. legal scholar and professor of law at Chapman University School of Law. Rotunda's first area of primary expertise is United States Constitutional law, and is the author of an influential 6-volume legal treatise on Constitutional Law. His other area of primary expertise is Legal Ethics, often called Professional Responsibility. He has also published an influential treatise on Legal Ethics, co-published by West-Thomson Reuters, ABA. He was also a senior fellow, in 2000, at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. In 1963, when Rotunda was 18 years old, he received a scholarship to attend Harvard University. Professor Rotunda later received a J.D. from Harvard Law School. Rotunda married Marcia Mainland in February 1969. She was formerly an attorney in the office of University Counsel during his time at Illinois. In 1966, shortly after his conviction, Albert DeSalvo, The Boston Strangler, was one of Rotunda's students in a law course for prisoners. In an article about this experience Rotunda described DeSalvo as charming, helpful and well-groomed, in contrast to every other student at the prison. Rotunda was Albert E. Jenner, Jr. Professor of Law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He was employed there for twenty-five years. He served as an advisor to Ken Starr during Starr's tenure as special prosecutor during the Clinton Administration. Previously, he had served on the investigative team during the Watergate scandal. As an advisor to the Independent Counsel in 1998, Rotunda was asked for an opinion on \\"whether a sitting President is subject to indictment.\\" In a 56-page response released by the National Archives following a Freedom of Information Act request by the New York Times, Rotunda concluded, \\"It is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting President for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the President's official duties. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.\\" He was married to Kyndra Rotunda (and divorced in 2014). The Rotundas were on faculty at George Mason University School of Law until departing in 2008 for Chapman University. Professor Rotunda died on March 14, 2018. Chapman University Law School will name a chair in his honor. ==Publications== *The Politics of Language: Liberalism as Word and Symbol Intro. by Daniel Schorr.

De motu: Sive; de motu principio et natura, et de causa communicationis motuum (On Motion: or The Principle and Nature of Motion and the Cause of the Communication of Motions), or simply De Motu,Berkeley's Philosophical Writings, New York: Collier, 1974, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 64-22680 is an essay written by George Berkeley and published in 1721. The essay was unsuccessfully submitted for a prize that had been offered by the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. Berkeley rejected Sir Isaac Newton's absolute space, time and motion. With this essay, Berkeley is considered to be the \\"precursor of Mach and Einstein\\" (Karl Popper)Karl R. Popper Conjectures and Refutations. The Growth of Scientific Knowledge, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1969, Part I, 6. \\"Note on Berkeley as precursor of Mach and Einstein\\"The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Micropædia, Vol. 2, Chicago, 2007Myhill, John \\"Berkeley's \\"De Motu\\" - An Anticipation of Mach\\" In: \\"George Berkeley: Lectures delivered before the Philosophical Union of the University of California\\" Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1957 (University of California Publications in Philosophy, Volume 29) ==Concrete and abstract motion== We must pay attention to facts regarding things and their nature, not to words or to someone's authority. The mind should be concerned with particular and concrete things themselves, not with abstract terms. The effects that are felt on our senses should be noticed. The causes of these effects are rationally inferred and are occult qualities. Gravity and force are examples of occult qualities. But they can be useful terms. Gravity can designate concrete bodies in motion and force can designate the concrete effort of resisting. However, they should not be used abstractly, separate from concrete, individual things. If no change occurs and there is no effect, then there is no force. Force, gravity, and attraction are mathematical, hypothetical abstractions and they are not found in nature as physical qualities. The parallelogram of composite forces is not a physical quality. It is mathematical. Attempts to explain the cause and origin of motion are abstract and obscure. They are not particular and determinate assertions. Such attempts try to explain the unknown by something that is even more unknown. ==Principles or causes of motion== Bodies are not known to contain, within themselves, forces that cause motion. Minds, however, are known to cause motion. Such minds are particular, individual causes that are parts of the primary, universal cause of motion. Bodies are passive, not active. They merely persist indifferently in their states, whether of impelled motion or of rest. Action and reaction are only mathematical hypotheses, not physical qualities. It is useful to refer to action and reaction when demonstrating mechanics, but they are not causes of motion. We personally experience within ourselves a cause of our bodily motion. It is called soul, mind, or spirit. But, we do not experience a cause of motions inside of other bodies. The ultimate cause of the motion of all bodies is the mind of God. This is known through metaphysics and theology. Natural science is limited to experiments and mechanics, but it assumes that God was the prime source of motion. The laws of motion, not the cause of motion, are established by natural science. Physicists explain and understand phenomena by showing how they agree with the laws of motion. Fictional, abstract, general terms such as force, action, and reaction are used in theories, formulas, and computations. These cannot be found in bodies.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol. I, \\"George Berkeley\\", New York: Macmillan, 1972 Through our senses, we actually experience only the effects of moving or resting bodies. The natural scientist is concerned with experiments, laws of motion, mechanical principles, and rational deduction from those principles. The principle and cause of motion itself is a metaphysical, theological, and moral concern. ==Nature of motion== Motion should not be considered as an abstraction, separated from space and time. It should not be analyzed into abstract ideas such as movement, velocity, and force. Mathematical considerations of spatial and temporal infinitesimals lead to paradoxes. Motion should not be equated with the cause of motion. To say that the quantity of motion is always conserved is to confuse motion itself with the force that causes motion. The force of the cause of motion is conserved. Motion is not an internal, living force in things. It is a lifeless, indifferent effect. ==Motion in space== Absolute space contains no bodies. But, as such, it would not be observable. Nothing is denoted by the words \\"absolute space.\\" Motion and space are relative. They presuppose a relationship to some other body through which they are determined. For a wider view, it would be useful to consider motion relative to the fixed stars, which would be considered as being at rest, instead of to absolute space. Just as we cannot know absolute space, we cannot know whether the whole universe is at rest or is moving uniformly in a direction. To determine the true nature of motion, we must follow three rules: (1) distinguish mathematical hypotheses from the nature of things; (2) beware of abstractions; (3) consider motion as sensible or imaginable and be content with relative measures. ==Communication of motion== Physical science is concerned only with mechanics. Therefore, it can be said that, in a collision, action and reaction are always opposite and equal. Such actions and forces, though, are only mathematical hypotheses. We only really know that the striking body loses motion and the struck body gains motion. We do not know if the motion is communicated from one body to another or if the motion is destroyed in the striker and is created in the struck. In the true nature of things, all bodies are passive. The truly active cause of motion is metaphysical and not the concern of physical science. ==See also== * Mach's principle * Relational space ==References== ==External links== * The Works of George Berkeley in English on Project Gutenberg, incl.

In 1710 he was created Prince of Teano. ==Biography== Daun was born in Vienna, the son of Wilhelm Graf Daun, also a Field Marshal. He served in the War of Spanish Succession under Eugene of Savoy, and gained his fame in the successful defence of Turin in 1706. He also laid siege to and conquered Gaeta on 30 September 1707. After the war, in 1713 Daun became the first Austrian Viceroy of Naples. In 1718 he lost the Battle of Milazzo during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, when Spain invaded neighbouring Sicily. From February until October 1725 Daun was interim Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. He was to prepare for the arrival of the new governor, Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria, sister of the Emperor Charles VI. The situation in the Austrian Netherlands was very difficult after the mismanagement by the previous plenipotentiary minister Hercule-Louis Turinetti, marquis of Prié. Daun profited from the positive atmosphere resulting from the departure of Prié. He enforced a reform of the military organisation and administration in the Southern Netherlands, in which he incorporated the existing 'Belgian' army into the imperial forces.Zedinger, R. (2000). Die Verwaltung der Österreichischen Niederlande in Wien (1714 - 1795), Böhlau Verlag, p. 141-142. From 1725 until 1736 he was Governor of Milan.

Maud dislikes and is openly contemptuous of her infertile son-in-law. Stan dumps Kennaway's nitroglycerine pills down the toilet and replace them with worthless sugar substitutes. Maud Kennaway's friend (and Vera's godmother), Ethel Dean (Kate Wilkinson), comes to visit, but Mrs. Patterson (Joyce Ebert)'s boarding house is not ready. Unable to find her own pills, Ethel Dean uses some of Maud's now worthless ones, and dies on Stan's couch following a cardiac incident. Stan tells the 911 operator that the deceased is Maud Kennaway, and Dr. Klein (Austin Pendleton) provides the necessary paperwork for her remains to be taken away for cremation. Maud wakes up, finds the body, and accuses him of murder. Stan manages to dodge all her blows with her cane, which causes her to stumble and cut her head on the radiator.

It emerges from the application of systems thinking to the industrial and other man-made activities and it is a central concept of sustainable development. In modern societies, the bulk of anthropogenic (man-made) material flows is related to one of the following activities: sanitation, transportation, habitation, and communication, which were \\"of little metabolic significance in prehistoric times\\".Brunner Paul H. and Rechberger H. (2002) Anthropogenic Metabolism and Environmental Legacies in Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change () Global man-made stocks of steel in buildings, infrastructure, and vehicles, for example, amount to about 25 Gigatonnes (more than three tonnes per person), a figure that is surpassed only by construction materials such as concrete.Müller, D.B., et al. 2013. Carbon emissions of infrastructure development. Environmental Science and Technology. 47(20) 11739-11746. Sustainable development is closely linked to the design of a sustainable anthropogenic metabolism, which will entail substantial changes in the energy and material turnover of the different human activities. Anthropogenic metabolism can be seen as synonymous to social or socioeconomic metabolism. It comprises both industrial metabolism and urban metabolism. ==Negative effects== In layman's terms, anthropogenic metabolism indicates the human impact on the world by the modern industrialized world. Much of these impacts include waste management, our ecological footprint, water footprints, and flow analysis (i.e., the rate at which we deplete the energy around us). Most anthropogenic metabolism happens in developed countries. According to Rosales, \\"Economic growth is at present the main cause of increased climate change, and climate change is a main mechanism of biodiversity loss; because of this, economic growth is a major catalyst of biodiversity loss.\\"Rosales, J. (2008). Economic Growth, Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss: Distributive Justice for the Global North and South. Conservation Biology, 22(6), 1409-1417. A water footprint is the amount of water that each of us use in our daily lives. Most of the world's water is salt water which we cannot use in our food or water supplies. Therefore, the freshwater sources that were once plentiful are now being diminished due to anthropogenic metabolism of the growing population. The water footprint encompasses how much fresh water is needed for each consumer’s needs. According to J. Allan, \\"there is a huge impact of water use on stores of surface and groundwater and on flows to which water is returned after use. These impacts are shown to be particularly high for manufacturing industries. For example, that there are less than 10 economies worldwide that have a significant water surplus, but that these economies have successfully met, or have the potential to meet, the water deficits of the other 190 economies. Consumers enjoy the delusion of food and water security provided by virtual water trade.Allan, J. (2009). Virtual Water in the Real World. Conservation Biology, 23(5), 1331-1332. In addition, the ecological footprint is a more economical and land-focused way of looking at human impact. Developed countries tend to have higher ecological footprints, which do not strictly correspond to a country's total population. According to research by Dias de Oliveira, Vaughan and Rykiel, \\"The Ecological Footprint...is an accounting tool based on two fundamental concepts, sustainability and carrying capacity. It makes it possible to estimate the resource consumption and waste assimilation requirements of a defined human population or economy sector in terms of corresponding productive land area.Dias de Oliveira, M. E., Vaughan, B. E., & Rykiel, E. (2005). Ethanol as Fuel: Energy, Carbon Dioxide Balances, and Ecological Footprint. Bioscience, 55(7), 593-602. One of the major cycles that humans can contribute to that cause a major impact on climate change is the nitrogen cycle. This comes from nitrogen fertilizers that us humans are using. Gruber and Galloway have researched, \\"The massive acceleration of the nitrogen cycle caused by the production and industrial use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers worldwide has led to a range of environmental problems. Most important is how the availability of nitrogen will affect the capacity of Earth's biosphere to continue absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and to thereby continue helping to mitigate climate change.\\"Gruber, N. Galloway, J.N. (2008). An Earth-system perspective of the global nitrogen cycle. Nature, 451, 293-296. The carbon cycle is another major contributor to climate change primarily from anthropogenic metabolism. A few examples of how humans contribute to the carbon in the atmosphere is by burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. By taking a close look at the carbon cycle Peng, Thomas and Tian have discovered that, \\"It is recognized that human activities, such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change, and forest harvesting at a large scale, have resulted in the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the onset of the industrial revolution. The increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 in the atmosphere, is believed to have induced climate change and global warming.Peng, Y., Thomas, S. C., & Tian, D. (2008). Forest management and soil respiration: Implications for carbon sequestration. Environmental Reviews, 1693-111. There are many things that are going to be affected by climate change instead of just humans, the animals are going to suffer as well. There is a forecast for extinctions of species because of their habitats being affected. An example of this is marine animals. There are major impacts on the marine systems as a result of anthropogenic metabolism, according to Blaustein, the dramatic findings indicate that \\"every square kilometer [is] affected by some anthropogenic driver of ecological change\\".Blaustein, R. (2008). Global Human Impacts. Bioscience, 58(4), 376. The negative effects of anthropogenic metabolism are seen through the water footprint, ecological footprint, carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, studies on the marine ecosystem that show major impacts by humans and developed countries which include more industries thus more anthropogenic metabolism. ==See also== * Dematerialization (economics) * Industrial metabolism * Social metabolism * Urban metabolism ==References== == Further reading == * Baccini, Peter and Brunner, Paul H., Metabolism of the Anthroposphere, Springer, 1991, Heidelberg, Berlin, New York, ().

It was brought into force by the Indian government from 26 October 2006. The Act provides for the first time in Indian law a definition of \\"domestic violence\\", with this definition being broad and including not only physical violence, but also other forms of violence such as emotional/verbal, sexual, and economic abuse. It is a civil law meant primarily for protection orders and not for meant to be enforced criminally. == Definitions == The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 different from the provision of the Penal Code - section 498A[1][1] of the Indian Penal Code - in that it provides a broader definition of domestic violence. Domestic violence is defined by Section 3 of the Act as \\"any act, omission or commission or conduct of the respondent shall constitute domestic violence in case it: # harms or injures or endangers the health, safety, life, limb or well-being, whether mental or physical, of the aggrieved person or tends to do so and includes causing physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse; or # harasses, harms, injures or endangers the aggrieved person to coerce her or any other person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any dowry or other property or valuable security; or # has the effect of threatening the aggrieved person or any person related to her by any conduct mentioned in clause (a) or clause (b); or # otherwise injures or causes harm, whether physical or mental, to the aggrieved person.\\" The Act goes on, through the section Explanation 1, to define \\"physical abuse\\",\\"sexual abuse\\", \\"verbal and emotional abuse\\" and \\"economic abuse\\". == Scope == Primarily meant to provide protection to the wife or female live-in partner from domestic violence at the hands of the husband or male live-in partner or his relatives, the law also extends its protection to women living in a household such as sisters, widows or mothers. Domestic violence under the act includes actual abuse or the threat of abuse whether physical, sexual, verbal, emotional or economic. Harassment by way of unlawful dowry demands to the woman or her relatives would also be covered under this definition. The salient features of the Protection from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 are as follows: * The Act seeks to cover those women who are or have been in a relationship with the abuser where both parties have lived together in a shared household and are related by consanguinity, marriage or a relationship in the nature of marriage, or adoption; in addition relationship with family members living together as a joint family are also included. Even those women who are sisters, widows, mothers, single women, or living with them are entitled to get legal protection under the proposed Act. * \\"Domestic violence\\" includes actual abuse or the threat of abuse that is physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic. Harassment by way of unlawful dowry demands to the woman or her relatives would also be covered under this definition. * One of the most important features of the Act is the woman’s right to secure housing. The Act provides for the woman’s right to reside in the matrimonial or shared household, whether or not she has any title or rights in the household. This right is secured by a residence order, which is passed by a court. These residence orders cannot be passed against anyone who is a woman. * The other relief envisaged under the Act is that of the power of the court to pass protection orders that prevent the abuser from aiding or committing an act of domestic violence or any other specified act, entering a workplace or any other place frequented visited by the abused, attempting to communicate with the abused, isolating any assets used by both the parties and causing violence to the abused, her relatives and others who provide her assistance from the domestic violence. * The draft Act provides for appointment of Protection Officers and NGOs to provide assistance to the woman w.r.t medical examination, legal aid, safe shelter, etc. * The Act provides for breach of protection order or interim protection order by the respondent as a cognizable and non-bailable offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to twenty thousand rupees or with both. Similarly, non-compliance or discharge of duties by the Protection Officer is also sought to be made an offence under the Act with similar punishment. While \\"economic abuse\\" includes deprivation of all or any economic or financial resources to which the victim is entitled under any law or custom whether payable under an order of a Court or otherwise or which the victim requires out of necessity including, but not limited to, household necessities for the aggrieved person and her children, if any, stridhan, property, jointly or separately owned by her, payment of rental related to the shared household and maintenance and disposal of household effects, any alienation of assets whether movable or immovable, valuables, shares, securities, bonds and the like or other property in which the victim has an interest or is entitled to use by virtue of the domestic relationship or which may be reasonably required by the victim or her children or her stridhan or any other property jointly or separately held by the victim and prohibition restriction to continued access to resources or facilities which the victim is entitled to use or enjoy by virtue of the domestic relationship including access to the shared household, \\"physical abuse\\" means any act or conduct which is of such a nature as to cause bodily pain, harm or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or development of the victim and includes assault, criminal intimidation and criminal force. ==Application to the magistrate== An application regarding domestic violence can be presented to the magistrate seeking one or more reliefs mentioned in sections by: *The aggrieved person, *Protection officer on behalf of aggrieved person *Any other person on behalf of aggrieved person ===Jurisdiction of court=== The first class magistrate court or metropolitan court shall be the competent court within the local limits of which *The aggrieved person permanently or temporary resides or carries on business or is employed *The respondent permanently or temporally resides or carries on business or is employed or *The cause of action arises. Any order made under this Act shall be enforceable throughout India While disposing application the magistrate shall take in to consideration any domestic incident report received from the protection officer or service provider. The relief sought under this section includes the issuance of order of payment or compensation or damages without prejudice to the right of such person to institute suit for compensation or damages for injuries caused by the act of domestic violence. If the magistrate is satisfied that an application prima facie discloses that the respondent is committing or has committed an act of domestic violence or there is a likelihood of such violence, he may grant following exparte interim order against the respondent on the basis of affidavit of the aggrieved person. Magistrate can issue different orders such as Protection order, residence order, monetary relief, custody order or compensatory orders as per the circumstances of the case. In case of an earlier decree of compensation or damages passed by any other court, in favour of aggrieved person, the amount if any paid shall be set off against the order of amount payable under this act. The application to the magistrate shall be as nearly possible to the formats prescribed under this Act and Rules. After receiving the application the Magistrate shall fix the date of first hearing within 3 days and the magistrate shall endeavor to dispose of every application be within a period of 60 days of the first hearing.

The magistrate may secure the service of suitable person preferably a woman including a person engaged in the welfare of women for assisting the court in the discharge of its function. If the circumstance of the case so warrant and if either party so desires the magistrate may conduct the proceedings on camera. ===Different kinds of order issued by the Magistrate=== ====Protection orders==== After giving an opportunity to the aggrieved person and respondent of being heard and the magistrate is satisfied that a prima facie case of domestic violence has taken place or is likely to take place, pass a protection order in favour of the aggrieved person prohibiting the respondent from the following acts such as Committing any acts of domestic violence *Aiding or abetting in the act of domestic violence *Entering the place of employment of aggrieved person or if the person is child, its school or any other places *Attempting to communicate in any form including personal, oral or written, electronic or telephonic contact *Alienating any assets, operating bank account, bank locker held or enjoyed by both parties jointly or singly by the respondent including her stridhan *Causing violence to the dependents, or other relative or any other person who give the assistance to the aggrieved person or *Committing any other acts specified by the protection officer ====Residence orders==== The magistrate being satisfied that a domestic violence has taken place, pass residence order- *Restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any manner disturbing the peaceful possession of the shared household *Directing the respondent to remove himself from the shared household *Restraining the respondent or his relatives from entering any portion of the shared house hold where the aggrieved person lives *Restraining the respondent from alienating or disposing of the shared house hold or encumbering it *Restraining the respondent from renouncing his right in the shared householdS.R. Batra v. Taruna Batra, 136 (2007) DLT 1 (SC): 1 (2007) DMC 1 (SC): 2007 (1) UJ 2 (SC). Case no. 5837; Civil appeal. C.A. No.-005837-005837 - 2006. Diary no. 5318-2005. Bench: S.B. Sinha & Markandey Katju. Supreme Court of India. Judgement regarding shared household (original): \\"It is well settled that any interpretation which leads to absurdity should not be accepted. Learned counsel for the respondent Smt Taruna Batra has relied upon Section 19(1)(f) of the Act and claimed that she should be given an alternative accommodation. In our opinion, the claim for alternative accommodation can only be made against the husband and not against the husband’s in-laws or other relatives. As regards Section 17(1) of the Act, in our opinion the wife is only entitled to claim a right to residence in a shared household, and a ‘shared household’ would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member. The property in question in the present case neither belongs to Amit Batra nor was it taken on rent by him nor is it a joint family property of which the husband Amit Batra is a member. It is the exclusive property of appellant No. 2, mother of Amit Batra. Hence it cannot be called a ‘shared household’. No doubt, the definition of ‘shared household’ in Section 2(s) of the Act ... we have to give it an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in society\\". Judgement regarding shared household (alternate): \\"In section 2(5) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 the court has to give an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in society\\". Date of Judgement: 15 December 2006. *Directing the respondent to secure same level of alternate accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her or to pay rent for the same if the circumstances so require. No order shall be made against women under this section. Magistrate may impose additional condition and pass any other order to protect the safety of the aggrieved person or her child. Magistrate is also empowered to order direction the concerned station house officer of the police station to give protection to the aggrieved person to assist in implementing his order. Magistrate may also impose on the respondent to direct stridhan or any other property or valuabale security she is entitled ====Monetary relief==== The magistrate may direct the respondent to pay monetary relief to meet the expenses of the aggrieved person and any child as a result of domestic violence and such relief include *Loss of earnings *Medical expenses *Loss caused due to destruction or removal or damage of any property *Pass order as to maintenance for the aggrieved person as well as her children if any Including the order under or in addition to an order of maintenance under section 125 criminal procedure code or any other law. The quantum of relief shall be fair reasonable and consistent with the standard of living to which the aggrieved person is accustomed to. Magistrate can order a lump sum amount also . On failure of the respondent to make payment of this order, magistrate shall order employer or debtor of the respondent to directly pay to the aggrieved person or to deposit in the court a portion of the salary or wage due to the respondent. Magistrate can order a lump sum amount also . On failure of the respondent to make payment of this order, magistrate shall order employer or debtor of the respondent to directly pay to the aggrieved person or to deposit in the court a portion of the salary or wage due to the respondent. ====Custody orders==== Magistrate can grant temporary custody of any child or children to the aggrieved person or to the person making application on her behalf and specify the arrangements for visit of such child by the respondent. Magistrate can refuse the visit of such respondent in such case if it may harmful to the interest of the child. ====Compensation orders==== Magistrate may pass order directing the respondent to pay compensation to the petitioner for injuries including mental torture and emotional distress caused by the acts of domestic violence committed by the respondent. Copies of orders passed by the magistrate shall be supplied free of cost to the parties concerned and police officer and service provider Any relief available under this Act may also be sought in any other legal proceedings before a civil court, family court or criminal court and such relief may be sought in addition to and along with relief sought for in suit, or legal proceeding before civil or criminal court. == Criticism == Some have criticized the law as having too little force, serving chiefly as a civil, rather than criminal, law—requiring a further offense by the accused respondent (such as violating a Protection Order issued under this law) before triggering criminal law sanctions against the respondent (such as arrest and imprisonment). There are several gaps in the implementation of laws.Shalu Nigam (2019) Women and Domestic Violence Law in India: A Quest for Justice https://www.amazon.in/Women-Domestic-Violence-Law-India/dp/1138366145 However, groups involved in drafting the law believed this would provide more rapid and flexible relief for the victim.Pandey, Geeta, et. al., BBC News, \\"100 Women 2014: Violence at home is India's 'failing'\\", 29 October 2014, BBC NewsHornbeck, Amy; Bethany Johnson; Michelle LaGrotta; & Kellie Sellman; \\"The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act: Solution or Mere Paper Tiger?\\", Loyola University Chicago International Law Review, Volume 4, Issue 2, Spring/Summer, 2007, pp.273-307, Loyola University, Chicago (also online at: ) Men's organizations such as the Save Indian Family Foundation have opposed the law, arguing that it might be misused by women during disputes. It has been noticed by women's groups that such claims emerge only when special provisions are made for the marginalised. Renuka Chowdhury, the Indian Minister for Women and Child Development, agreed in a Hindustan Times article that \\"an equal gender law would be ideal. But there is simply too much physical evidence to prove that it is mainly the woman who suffers at the hands of man\\". Former Attorney General of India Soli Sorabjee has also criticized the broad definition of verbal abuse in the act. According to the then President of India, Pratibha Devisingh Patil, \\"Another disquieting trend has been that women themselves have not been innocent of abusing women. At times women have played an unsavory, catalytic role in perpetrating violence whether against the daughter-in-law, the mother-in-law or female domestic helps. Instances exist whereby protective legal provisions for the benefit of women have been subjected to distortion and misuse to wreak petty vengeance and to settle scores. Some surveys have concluded that 90 percent of dowry complaints are false and were registered primarily to settle scores. It is unfortunate if laws meant to protect women get abused as instruments of oppression. The bottom-line therefore, is the fair invocation of legal provisions and their objective and honest implementation.\\" ==See also== * Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 * Domestic violence in India * Honor killing in India * Dowry system in India * Dowry death in India * Bride burning * Dowry system in India * Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 * Violence against women * The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 ==References== ==External links== * Domestic Violence Act 2005 Category:Acts of the Parliament of India 2005 Category:Indian family law Category:Women's rights in India Category:Women's rights legislation Category:Violence against women in India Category:2005 in women's history ","title":"Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005"},{"id":"7774902","text":"Little Noises is a 1992 dramedy film directed by Jane Spencer.

He continued his study of music theory and orchestration with Mro. Anthony Chircop at the Johann Strauss School of Music in Valletta. He studied harmony and counterpoint for three years with Maltese composer Mro. Carmelo Pace. At age 16 he collaborated with Mro. Paul Borg in practical sessions on trumpet playing, and later continued to work on advanced harmony and orchestration. He studied conducting under the guidance of Mro Brian Schembri. ==Musical career== Trumpeter Sigmund Mifsud is a full-time member of the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra[1]. His career as performer includes performing as a session musician with various orchestras in musical production,[2] television appearances, and solo recitals. Sigmund also performed as a lead trumpeter with the Johann Strauss School of Music Big Band in three editions of the Malta Jazz Festival. He is the founder of the Sliema Youth Band. Some selected solo performances with orchestra are: in 2010 the Henri Tomasi Trumpet Concerto in B flat performed with a private orchestra, solo parts for Trumpet from Gershwin’s Concerto in F for Trumpet and Piano as well as the Symphonic Dances from Westside Story during the Malta Arts Festival Opening Concert under the baton of Mro. Wayne Marshall; in 2008 the Trumpet Concerto in E flat major from Haydn’s Series of Baroque Concerts also with a private orchestra; and in 2006 Shostakovich Concerto in C minor for Piano, Trumpet, and String Orchestra during the Centenary Concert under the baton of Mro. Brian Schembri Musical Director & Arranger Sigmund’s aim to deliver various music concepts to a diverse audience led him to start experimenting with fusion of classical and pop music, first with the Kenya Fund Raising Concerts, where he amalgamated a string orchestra with a wind band. In 2004, Sigmund produced the first edition of the National Orchestra goes Pop but it was in the second edition in 2005 where he had been trusted with the role of musical director of the National Orchestra.[3] This proved to be a successful formula and continued in the following two editions of the concert in 2006 and 2007. Arrangements and any adaptations of musical compositions for the national philharmonic orchestra had Sigmund’s signature. In his career he has prepared arrangements for philharmonic orchestra, big band, combo band and light orchestra and for different styles of music ranging from pop, rock, folk and swing.See Big Band Concert Sigmund also developed music arrangements and was appointed music consultant for the non-classical scores in the following two performances: * Joseph Calleja, Dionne Warwick & Riccardo Cocciante - Conductor: Paul Bateman (29/07/2010) * Joseph Calleja & Michael Bolton- Conductor: Paul Bateman (19/07/2009) Sigmund’s latest remarkable work was definitely highlighted during the two editions of Rockestra, a concert unique in its concept for Malta, not only the National Philharmonic Orchestra engaged in playing rock music but the audience was standing creating a more of a show atmosphere. Rockestra is organised under the patronage of the President of Malta in aid of the Malta Community Chest Fund. Concert Producer Sigmund’s experience in the music industry has also developed in an entrepreneurial manner. His first concert production was the first edition of the National Orchestra goes Pop in 2004; and the three editions that followed in 2005, 2006[2] and 2007. He co-produced the Manoel Theatre Swing Concert, Sigmund in a Classical Mood – Trumpet Recital and the 2008 Earth Garden Arts & Music Festival Concert. In 2010, he was producer for the Hilton Swings Concert and also the Movie Spectacular. Definitely another milestone was achieved in the production of the two editions of Rockestra. ==References== ^ Members of the Orchestra, Malta Philharmonic Orchestra.

Parry O'Brien had also improved over that time but was almost 2 feet behind Nieder. A graduate of the University of Kansas, Nieder was the first collegiate athlete to better the 60-foot mark with a 16-pound shot. He was also the first high school prep athlete to break the 60-foot barrier with a 12-pound shot put.

Originally developed in 1973, the mall flourished and expanded during the 1980s, but began to encounter financial difficulties by the 1990s. Bloomingdale's closed its location in 1990, which triggered a court battle with the mall's then-owner, LaSalle Street Fund, when Montgomery Ward attempted to acquire the anchor space once occupied by Bloomingdale's, which resulted in the space remaining empty until JCPenney opened there in 1996. The site of the mall's original movie theater closed in 1991, stayed empty for over a decade, and was eventually renovated and replaced with studio spaces for radio stations KBFB and KZMJ. A new, larger AMC movie theater later opened in 2004. The addition of this new theater slowed, but did not halt, the mall's falling fortunes. Macy's (who acquired the department store Foley's in 2006) closed in March 2008; Dillard's closed their location in December 2008; and, JCPenney later closed its location in April 2013. All three respective anchor spaces remained vacant despite differing proposed plans for renovation. The 21st century saw the mall change ownership and management multiple times. Nearby demographic shifts and the continuing occupancy decline led owners to announce plans to redevelop the mall and surrounding area. In mid 2012, the mall began a new effort to create an artistic community. Dubbed \\"The Gallery at Midtown and Artists Studios,\\" the wings remaining open were occupied by local artists' studios, galleries, and other creative groups. Beginning December 2016, demolition of the mall site was slated to begin (with some noteworthy exceptions) and the surrounding real estate was set to be redeveloped into a mixed-use development that would be called Dallas Midtown. But demolition was temporarily halted in 2017 with the only locations demolished being a former parking garage and the space formerly occupied by Sanger-Harris/Foley's/Macy's as the planned redevelopments stalled due to separate legal conflicts, zoning, and the loss of public sector incentives from the City of Dallas. In May 2017, The Gallery and Studios were closed indefinitely. During 2017, each radio station closed their respective spaces and relocated to new, different locations. On July 16, 2017, the longest running anchor, Sears, closed its location, making AMC Theatres the only remaining anchor in operation and the only portion of the original mall site remaining accessible to the public. In February 2019, the remaining tenants in the corridor to the former Sears and AMC Theatres were forced to vacate before the end of March 2019. In May 2019, with the former JCPenney and former Dillard's halfway through demolition, the former Sears corridor was blocked off from public access and was being prepared for demolition, with one entrance that was left open to allow public access to the AMC Theatres as a result of closure of the entrance by the former Sears site. The former sites of JCPenney, Macy's, Dillard's, Sears, and the corridors are now closed off from public access, along with the first floor that included the former food court. Demolition of the original mall site and former anchor sites is scheduled to be completed by the end of October 2019. Construction of Dallas Midtown is currently slated for the start of 2020. AMC Theatres will continue to remain open at its current location until at least 2021 similar to JCPenney remaining in operation by Plano's Collin Creek Mall during that former mall site's redevelopment, which closed on July 31, 2019. ==History== East entrance, June 2012 The mall was originally developed around 1973 when Homart Development Company, the real estate development subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Co. at the time, added a Sanger-Harris and several smaller stores to the existing Sears store that had been built in 1965. In August 1973, as part of the mall's grand opening celebration, the Thom McAn Shoe Store offered a free 8 oz. steak with any purchase of $5 or more. This promotion drew local and national media attention. LaSalle Street Fund bought the mall in 1982 and oversaw continued expansion, including the addition of a fourth anchor store in 1983. September 1, 1985, marked the first legal Sunday shopping day in the State of Texas. It, like other area malls, celebrated the end of the state's 24-year-old blue law with entertainment and special promotions. Some smaller retailers objected to the new hours but mall officials informed them in writing of their contractual obligations to operate while the mall is open. January 1, 1987, was the first New Year's Day that the anchor stores were open for business on the holiday. Many smaller stores in the mall followed their lead, although it would be a few years before every store would be obligated to be open on the first day of the new year. The Macerich Company, a Santa Monica, California-based shopping center operator, purchased the mall in 1996 for a reported $85.5 million in cash and debt. Beginning around 2000, the neighborhoods near the mall became notably younger, poorer, and more ethnically diverse. According to the 2010 census, the surrounding neighborhood was 60% Hispanic with the percentage of white residents dropping from about 35% in 2000 to just under 25%. Around 2003, Steve & Barry's opened in a junior anchor space next to Foley's, which closed in 2008. In 2010, LNR Partners, Inc., of Miami, Florida, took possession of the mall when Macerich defaulted on $125 million in debt. Jones Lang LaSalle became responsible for mall management. The former space of Steve & Barry's reopened as Bontera Bazzar circa 2011, and was renamed El Mercado the following year. With a change in ownership during 2012, Jones Lang LaSalle ended their management involvement as a new owner, Beck Ventures, took management in-house. With exceptions made at the time for AMC Valley View 16, Sears, and the studios for radio stations KBFB and KZMJ, the original mall site was slated to be demolished beginning in December 2016, with the original site space and surrounding properties being redeveloped into a mixed-use development called \\"Dallas Midtown.\\" But as of June 2018, much of these redevelopment plans have yet to come to fruition due to various conflicts. ==Current Anchor== ===AMC Valley View 16=== AMC Valley View 16 from the south side of the mall, June 2012 In 2000, as part of a general redevelopment of the mall, Valley View Center Mall officials announced the addition of a 20-screen AMC movie theater as a fifth anchor. After several delays, construction for a 16-screen AMC movie theater began in June 2003 and officially opened on May 14, 2004. The grand opening was marked by a ceremonial \\"ticket-tearing\\" featuring Dat Nguyen and Jason Witten of the Dallas Cowboys. The stadium-style seating theater complex was built on top of the Sears anchor store so that no parking or retail space would be removed for the new anchor. As a result, this addition created a third, and an unused fourth, floor of the mall. It is the last remaining anchor still in operation and the only location on the original mall site accessible to the public. ==Former Anchors and Features== ===Sears (1965-2017)=== The Sears, Roebuck and Company anchor predates the mall itself having been built in 1965. This Sears was built as a 2 story freestanding store on what was then the far north fringe of Dallas County and the location was largely surrounded by pasture land. Seven years later, the Homart Development Company built a Sanger-Harris department store on the site and connected it to Sears with a corridor of specialty retailers, creating Valley View Center Mall. In April 2017, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 30 stores nationwide. The store officially closed on July 16, 2017; but, unlike the other closed anchor sites, the interior corridor to the former store would remain publicly accessible until May 2019. In December 2017, New York City- based Seritage Growth Properties, which was formed in 2015 led by Eddie Lampert when Sears Holdings sold 235 of its store properties to Seritage, including the Sears at Valley View Center Mall, in partnership with Dallas- based KDC, announced plans to build two towers with up to a combined one million square feet of office space on 23 acres of the former Sears site.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/13131-preston-rd/3312636/landing Jared operates an outparcel on the site. ===Sanger-Harris (1973-1987) / Foley's (1987-2006) / Macy's (2006-2008)=== The former Macy's (originally Sanger-Harris) in June 2012 The mall's second anchor () opened in August 1973 as a two-level Sanger-Harris department store as part of the original Valley View Center development. A third floor was added to the store circa 1976. Sanger Harris was merged with Foley's and ceased using the Sanger Harris naming convention in 1987; then, the now-combined company was sold to May Department Stores in 1988. The store was eventually rebranded to Macy's on September 9, 2006 as a result of Federated Department Stores' purchase of the May Company in 2005. This location ceased operation and closed on March 15, 2008. In September 2011, the building's owner at the time, Montfort Mall LLC, announced plans to occupy the building with a \\"general merchandise\\" store. This particular plan never materialized. The front parking lot was later fenced off from public access for automobiles from April through December 2016. In February 2017, the exterior mosaic murals originally commissioned by Sanger-Harris were removed and demolition on the site was officially commenced by the site's owner, EF Properties, with plans to redevelop the site for mixed-use redevelopment in partnership with Ross Perot Jr.'s Hillwood Urban. Total demolition, however, stalled after Beck Ventures sued to prevent the site from being demolished completely. A trial on the fate of this particular plan was set for August 2018. The site was later completely demolished by the end of March 2019. === Valley View Cinema 1 & 2 (1975-1991) / Radio One (2002-2017) === In 1975, a twin-screen movie theater owned and operated by General Cinema Corporation was added to the northeast corner of the mall. The theater, formally known as Valley View Cinema 1 & 2, closed in 1991. The facade of the movie theater was then boarded up and the interior furnishings were stripped out. The space remained empty until it was renovated in late 2001 by Radio One to house radio stations KBFB and KSOC. Renovation included leveling the sloping floors in the theater and installing new air-conditioning and heating units. Officially opened in January 2002, the broadcast studios, located on the mall's second level, are in what were originally the former theater's projection rooms. The area that originally housed the box office counters became the reception desk and part of one movie theater was retained as a 150-seat auditorium. The facility also included a small basketball court, two production studios, a mix room, a newsroom, and office space. Both radio stations closed their respective spaces and relocated to new, separate locations in 2017. ===Dillard's (1979-2008)=== The mall's third anchor, a Dillard's department store (), opened in 1979 originally as a two-level store accompanied by further expansion of the mall. In October 1985, a third sales floor and a fourth floor storage room and penthouse were added to the store location. Linens, furniture, electronics and housewares were relocated to the new third level and several clothing departments on the original two levels were expanded. A candy and cookie department as well as a juniors' department were added. On July 2, 2008, Dillard's announced that it would close this location effective August 30, 2008. After the store closed, the Dillard's signage on the building, and on the mall's road sign, still remained for a few months until they were removed by management, respectively. The entrances were shuttered and the mall's parking deck has been fenced off twice since closing: once from 2009 to 2013, and once again after November 2016. Asbestos removal in the former Dillard's space occurred in March 2019 and demolition of the site began the next month. ===Bloomingdale's (1983-1990) / JCPenney (1996-2013)=== JCPenney (originally Bloomingdale's) in June 2012 In 1982, LaSalle Street Fund purchased Valley View Center Mall and expanded the mall again with more interior stores, including a fourth anchor store. This () new anchor location was originally developed for Bloomingdale's, which opened its doors in early 1983. On August 18, 1990, Bloomingdale's closed this location due to declining sales and rising local competition. After the store's closure, the mall, which identified store locations by anchor store quadrants, furnished the former Bloomingdale's corridor with a grand piano, added landscaping and artwork, and branded the area as \\"The Conservatory.\\" In August 1990, Montgomery Ward & Co. Inc. attempted to acquire the ground lease for this anchor space from Federated Department Stores Inc. through a bankruptcy court proceeding. The company had plans to buy the building for a new Montgomery Ward location. Valley View Center Mall's owner at the time, Chicago, Illinois-based LaSalle Street Fund Inc. of Delaware, filed an objection to this plan. In March 1991, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Cincinnati, Ohio, ruled that Federated may withdraw from its deal to sell the building in favor of a deal from the LaSalle Street Fund to \\"avoid further costs of litigation\\" and as it would be \\"a sound business decision.\\" JCPenney opened a store at the location on October 19, 1996. The former Bloomingdale's space was gutted between 1995 and 1996. From 1996 to 2012, this location was the region's largest JCPenney store. This particular store was the planned location of the \\"secret\\" prototype JCPenney store. The third floor was closed from public access in March 2012 and a new logo was placed on one side of the building four months later. In February 2013, JCPenney announced that this location would be closed on May 1, 2013, but did not actually undergo a liquidation sale because supposedly the store would reopen the next year.http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/valley-view-centers-j-c-penney- is-closing-by-may-1-as-the-company-uses-the-space-to-build-its-store-of-the- future.html/ Everything on the second floor except the styling salon was closed off from the public in January and the store did close on May 1, 2013, as planned.http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2013/04/j-c-penneys-valley-view- center-store-closes-on-sunday.html/ This \\"store of the future\\" prototype was scheduled to open in the same space in 2014, but this never occurred because the company decided ultimately to not carry out their original plan. Because of the failure to follow through with the \\"store of the future\\" reopening, from October 14–19, 2016, remaining store closure signs were removed from the west entrance and the location finally began its liquidation of the space's remaining items: furniture, office items, display cases, lighting fixtures, planters, shelving units, mannequins, holiday decor, and leftover merchandise. The \\"JCPenney 1902\\" carvings on the mall entrances remained long after the store's closure in 2013 and were not covered up or removed until demolition on the site began in early 2019. ===Smart Shoppers Club (1994-2000)=== In April 1994, Valley View Center added a frequent-shopper rewards program called the Smart Shoppers Club. Mall management said they planned to spend roughly $500,000 over the first two years of the program in a bid to increase mall traffic while collecting invaluable demographic data about mall shoppers. Within five months, 9,000 shoppers had joined the club and the mall announced a goal of 20,000 members by the end of 1994. Shoppers logged their visits by swiping their membership card and entering a personal identification number at one of the mall's three touch-screen kiosks. Member benefits included special discount coupons, free gifts, and the chance to win prizes. Club members also received a periodic Shopping Smart newsletter, a Valley View Center shopping bag, plus a birthday card and gift. The Smart Shoppers Club was terminated in late 2000 when it was replaced by a cardless web-based system called Centerlinq. Customers were then able to redeem their old Smart Shoppers Club cards at the mall's customer service desk for a Valley View Center T-shirt. ===Dallas Children's Museum (2000-2006)=== Originally opened in August 1998 at the Inwood Village shopping center, the Dallas Children's Museum relocated to Valley View Center in June 2000. The new museum, double the size of the previous location, was on the second level of the mall between the former JCPenney and the space once occupied by the Disney Store. For six years, the museum hosted both touring cultural exhibits and permanent features, including a play hospital and kid-sized grocery store. In September 2006, the Museum of Nature & Science and the Dallas Children's Museum announced their merger and closed the Valley View Center location. The museum reopened in Fair Park as the Children's Museum at the Museum of Nature & Science in October 2006. ===The Gallery at Midtown and Artists Studios (2012-2017)=== As part of a cultural experiment, Beck Ventures began talks in mid 2012 with notable local artists about creating a thriving, artistic community, along with North Texas' largest local artist cooperative gallery, later known as \\"The Gallery at Midtown and Artist Studios,\\" located at the center of the western portion of Valley View Center Mall. By 2014, this comprised over 90% of three upstairs wings of the mall. Surrounding the main gallery were several artist-run studios and showrooms, experimental galleries, private galleries, work spaces, a movie school, an actor's studio, and other artistic groups. Every third Saturday of the month from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., the Gallery at Midtown was open to the public for an \\"Art Walk.\\" The Gallery and Studios were closed indefinitely in May 2017 with plans to return as part of Dallas Midtown. ==Current status and future plans== Sign facing Interstate 635 Service Rd Beginning in 2011, the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce become involved in an effort to coordinate the redevelopment of the mall and the surrounding area. In April 2012, then-new owners Beck Ventures announced a $2 billion redevelopment plan for the mall and surrounding property dubbed \\"Dallas Midtown\\" that will include retail, condominiums, and a \\"five star\\" hotel. To fill vacant spaces, storefronts were soon converted into artist studios and a gallery, which remain in place as of June 2018. A mercado was set to be constructed in cooperation with a local Spanish-language radio station, and multiple food court restaurants were to become home to test kitchens for local food trucks. Since 2012 however, various problems arose that have prevented much of the redevelopment plans from being carried out. The second floor of El Mercado was closed in May 2014. Approximately $36 million in tax incentives from the City of Dallas were rescinded when Beck Ventures failed to raze the original mall site in its entirety by the end of June 2016, as first planned. A later proposal in 2017 by Beck Ventures of $50 million in new incentives was rejected by the Dallas City Council. By early 2017, El Mercado was closed in its entirety. In September 2017, 100 acres of the original mall site was proposed in a joint venture to be the location for Amazon HQ2. ==Honors and awards== In November 2007, the International Council of Shopping Centers presented a Maxi award in the Community Relations category to Valley View Center for work with the Tejas Council of Girls Scouts. ==See also== *List of shopping malls in Dallas, Texas ==References== ==External links== *Official website * *Gallery @ Midtown Category:Economy of Dallas Category:Shopping malls established in 1973 Category:Shopping malls in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex Category:1973 establishments in Texas Category:Shopping malls disestablished in 2019 ","title":"Valley View Center Mall"},{"id":"7774975","text":"Rocketcrash is the first material released by The Mushroom River Band.

Malchijah led the fifth of the 24 priestly divisions. The biblical passage of 1 Chronicles 24 documents the division of the priests during the reign of King David. These priests were all descendants of Aaron, who had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. However, Nadab and Abihu died before Aaron and only Eleazar and Ithamar had sons. One priest, Zadok, from Eleazar's descendants and another priest, Ahimelech, from Ithamar's descendants were designated to help create the various priestly orders. Sixteen of Eleazar's descendants were selected to head priestly orders while only eight of Ithamar's descendants were so chosen. The passage states that this was done because of the greater number of leaders among Eleazar's descendants. Lots were drawn to designate the order of ministering for the heads of the priestly orders when they entered the temple. Since each order was responsible for ministering during a different week, Malchijah's order was stationed as a watch at the Tabernacle during the fifth week of the year on the Hebrew calendar. ==In Nehemiah== Persons with the name of Malchijah are also mentioned in Nehemiah. Malchijah, the son of Harim, is mentioned in Nehemiah 3:11 as a worker with Nehemiah and Eliashib on the repairs to the walls of Jerusalem. Malchijah, the son of Rechab, was another worker mentioned in Nehemiah 3:14 with Nehemiah and Eliashib on the Jerusalem walls repair. Another reference to Malchijah as a goldsmith working with Nehemiah and Eliashib is mentioned in Nehemiah 3:31 and a Malchijah is named as one of those who stood with Ezra during the reading of the law in Nehemiah 8:4. In Nehemiah 12:42, another reference to one of these Malchijah's is mentioned again as Nehemiah's assistant during the dedication service of the restored walls of Jerusalem. ==In Ezra== In Ezra 10:25, two sons of Parosh are named among those of Israel who had taken foreign wives. ==In Jeremiah== A Malchiah or Melchiah was mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah, Chapter 21, Verse 1. Melchiah was a priest in the kingdom of Zedekiah, and the father of Pashur, the messenger who was charged with taking a message from the King to Jeremiah asking for God's intervention in the war against Nebuchadnezzar. ==References== ==External links== *Strong's Bible Dictionary * 1 Chronicles 24 on Chabad.org with Rashi's commentary *Hebrew-English parallel text *Web Bible Encyclopedia *Hitchcock's Dictionary of Bible Names *Baby names on parenthood.com Category:Hebrew Bible people ","title":"Malchijah"},{"id":"7774991","text":"NASCAR Racing 2002 Season is the successor to NASCAR Racing 4, released in 2002. ==Reception== The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", just one point shy of \\"universal acclaim\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

First broadcast on 5 September 1988 it is one of S4C's longest- running shows and renowned for its coverage of European football, but for the first few years the show also featured highlights of rallying, rugby league, hurling, gaelic football, ice hockey and climbing. In the days before cable or satellite television services, the success of Sgorio extended beyond Wales' border as football fans in England tuned-in to watch the programme with Spain's featuring alongside Italy's and latterly, Germany's . Since 2008 has also broadcast a live Welsh Premier League match each weekend with the Monday evening programme featuring highlights from both the Welsh Premier and Spain's . == History== The idea for a programme covering European football was conceived by Caernarfon-based independent production company, , to coincide with Ian Rush's transfer from Liverpool to Juventus and Mark Hughes' move from Manchester United to Barcelona. By the time the programme started, both players had returned to their English clubs. The first programme was presented by former Swansea RFC and Wales winger, Arthur Emyr and included the Barcelona derby between Barcelona and Espanyol at the Nou Camp, the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship between Galway and Tipperary, tennis from Cincinnati featuring Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander, badminton from Hong Kong and a USSR v Australia basketball match. === European football === In the early 1990s, S4C decided the programme should concentrate solely on European football highlights, with the German being added to and , and in 1997, the between Real Madrid and Barcelona was shown live on S4C with current Wales assistant manager, Osian Roberts as one of the studio guests. Sgorio has also broadcast highlights from the Dutch , in France and the Portuguese at various times since the first series. European coverage has since been scaled back heavily, though brief highlights of continue to feature on the Monday evening show. As well as Welsh international football matches, S4C has also aired live matches from the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, FA Cup and FA Trophy under the banner. === Presenters === Arthur Emyr was the show's first presenter, but when he left the programme in 1995 Amanda Protheroe-Thomas took over, becoming one of the first female football anchors on television. In 2002 Morgan Jones took over as the presenter before becoming the show's Saturday afternoon presenter in 2008 alongside Malcolm Allen with Nic Parry and Alun Williams taking over the Monday night programme. In 2010 Dylan Ebenezer joined the team as a presenter and commentator with former Celtic and Wales striker, John Hartson also joining the team as a pundit.

The term comes from the treatise called The British Moment: The Case for Democratic Geopolitics in the Twenty-first Century, written by young academics in The Henry Jackson Society, a foreign policy organisation at the University of Cambridge. It suggests that the United Kingdom now finds itself in a unique period where it can play a major and decisive role in the 21st century world. As such, it calls for the British government to maintain strong armed forces and promote British values and interests robustly in the wider world. The authors also call for strong transatlantic relations between North America and Europe, and for further European integration, especially in issues pertaining to foreign affairs and military strategy. The treatise came at a time when Britain's global role had increased under the leadership of Prime Minister Tony Blair, and British armed forces had been deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sierra Leone, the former Yugoslavia and several other countries.

He is the eighth- richest American of all time, with a net worth of $85 billion in 2016 dollars. He was known as the \\"timber-king of the Northwest.\\" ==Biography== Friedrich was one of 11 children of Johann Weyerhäuser and his wife. The family supported itself by working a farm and a vineyard near Nieder-Saulheim in the independent Grand Duchy of Hesse. Friedrich started attending the Lutheran school at Nieder-Saulheim when he was 6, and at 8 began helping on the farm. When he was 12, his father died, and Friedrich had to give up most of his studies to help out on the farm. The Revolutions of 1848 in Germany prompted several members of his family to emigrate to western Pennsylvania in the United States. They sent back glowing letters describing the conditions they found. In 1852, at the age of 17, Weyerhäuser emigrated with a group of his family from Hesse to the United States. They landed in New York City in July and proceeded to Pennsylvania, settling at North East. Frederick went to work for an earlier immigrant in a brewery. After two years, he abandoned the brewing business, because, as he put it, he felt that a brewer \\"often becomes his own best customer.\\" He then worked on a farm for a year. His share of the funds from the sale of the family farm in Germany enabled him to move on further west in search of opportunity, and 1856 found him in Rock Island, Illinois, working on the construction of the Rock Island and Peoria Railroad. After a short time, he entered the sawmill of Mead, Smith and Marsh as a night fireman, quickly moving up to tallyman and then yard manager and salesman.Ritter, Luke. \\"Frederick Weyerhaeuser.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified May 27, 2015. When the company opened a new yard in Coal Valley, he was sent to manage it. Though his yard prospered, the firm got into financial difficulties, and with savings from his salary Frederick bought the business. Thus he began doing business under his own name. With his brother-in-law, Frederick Denkmann, he formed the Weyerhaeuser-Denkmann Lumber Company and began to acquire interests, including some majority interests, in many other timber companies. He became the central point in what was later called the \\"Weyerhauser Syndicate,\\" a network of lumber interests, \\"reputed to have almost a hundred partners, none of whom knew the business of the others,\\" with Weyerhaeuser as the common link. In 1872, he established the Mississippi River Boom and Logging Co., an alliance that handled all the logs that were processed on the Mississippi River. In 1900, Weyerhäuser bought of timberland in the Pacific Northwest from James J. Hill and founded the Weyerhäuser Timber Company. One of the 30 factories in which he held an interest was Potlatch, later Potlatch Corporation. He also owned interests in the Boise Cascade Corporation. The Weyerhaeuser Company is still the world's largest seller of timber. In 1906, Weyerhäuser's business concerns entered the public eye when the Interstate Commerce Commission recommended to Congress that the lumber industry be investigated for possible anti-trust violations. Weyerhäuser ignored the resulting attention. Weyerhäuser married Sarah Elizabeth Bloedel on October 11, 1857. The couple had seven children: John P. Weyerhauser, Elise (Weyerhauser) Bancroft Hill, Margaret (Weyerhauser) Jewett, Apollonia (Weyerhauser) Davis, Charles A. Weyerhauser, Rudolph M. Weyerhauser, and Frederick E. Weyerhauser. In thanks to his home community, in 1904 he established a music hall in Saulheim. Weyerhäuser was buried in the family mausoleum in Chippiannock Cemetery in Rock Island, Illinois. Weyerhäuser was inducted into the U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1978. ==See also== *Weyerhaeuser House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ==References== == Further reading== * Healey, Judith Koll.

After living and tutoring in the United States, where he gained his doctorate in music, Calligaris established his residence in Italy in 1974. == The pianist == Calligaris was born in Rosario, Argentina. His career as a performer started at the age of thirteen. He pursued his studies under the guidance of such masters as Jorge Fanelli, Arthur Loesser,Arthur Loesser (New York, U.S.A., 1894 - Cleveland, 1969): brilliant American pianist, studied with Stojowski and Goetschius at the Institute of Musical Art in N.Y.; began an auspicious concert career in 1913, touring Australia and the Orient in 1920-21. In 1926 he was appointed a prof. of piano at the Cleveland Institute of Music. His books include \\"Men, Women and Pianos: a Social History\\" (Thompson 1975; Slonimsky 1984). Adele Marcus, Nikita Magaloff, and Guido Agosti.Guido Agosti (Forli', Italy, 1901 - Milano 1989): Italian pianist and teacher, Agosti studied piano with Busoni, Mugellini and Ivaldi. He commenced his professional career as a pianist in 1921. He taught piano at the Venice Conservatoire and at the Rome Conservatoire. In 1947 he was appointed prof. of piano at the Accademia Chigiana (Siena) (Slonimsky 1984). Calligaris' technique is characterised by the sheer brilliance and powerful touch typical of the Leschetizky school;Theodor Leschetitzky (Lancut, Austrian Poland, 1830 - Dresden, Germany, 1915): great Austrian pianist and famous pedagogue. Leschetitzky settled in Vienna in 1878, where he developed his own school of piano. His fame grew, and pupils flocked from all over the world to his studio. His most celebrated pupil was Paderewski: other pupils were Gabrilowitsch, Schnabel, Hambourg, Leginska and Bloomfield-Zeisler. His method of playing with the \\"Kugelhand\\" (arched hand) was to secure fullness of tone and finger dexterity, with the flexible wrist reserved for octave playing and chord passages (Slonimsky 1984). An outline of Leschetitzky's piano school can be found at the International Piano Archives at Maryland. his technical qualities,\\"His playing is distinguished by a romantic elan and viruoso technique\\" (Slonimsky 1984). complemented by a detailed attention to the composition’s form, made him a fine interpreter of both romantic (especially Schumann and Chopin) and post-romantic (Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Debussy) repertoire. Calligaris has performed in prestigious concert-halls such as the Konzertsaal Bundesallee in Berlin, the Auditorium of S. Cecilia in Rome, the Musikverein Brahms-Saal in Vienna, and recently, as a soloist in his own Concerto for piano and orchestra op. 29, at the Main Theatre of Manila. He has recorded, among the others, for EMI, Orion Records and the Ares-Libreria Editrice Vaticana; the latter, a few years ago, released a compilation entitled Sergio Calligaris: composer and interpreter to celebrate the twenty- fifth year of his recording debut. * A list of Calligaris' recordings (with musical excerpts) can be found at: Discography * Reviews of Calligaris as a performer can be found at: Piano reviews == The composer == Calligaris turned back to composition around the end of the 1970s, after some twenty years spent performing. One of his earliest works, Renzo's piano notebook, Op. 7 (written in 1978), has since become a widely executed contemporary piano piece.The definition 'memorable piece' is in Musicalnews 2002 (Musicalnews article); the work is also performed regularly by artists such as Marcella Crudeli (Biography) and Roberto Prosseda (Home page). In this oeuvre featuring ten short and well-characterised pictures, all qualities of Calligaris’ music can already be singled out: ** the vivid opposition between \\"elegiac\\" and \\"flamboyant and wild\\" themes ** a dramatic use of rhythmBoth characteristics are discussed in Giordana's and Zurletti's reviews . ** a disciplined and, at the same time, extremely complex master of counterpoint The use of counterpoint in Calligaris's music has been also considered as \\"a sign of a youth Hindemithian heritage \\" (Brunetti 2006). The influence of Hindemith is also pointed out by Prefumo in . ** the adoption of \\"classical\\" composing forms (see, just as an example, the use of form in the Prelude, choral, double fugue and finale op. 19).\\"As a composer, he effectively utilizes romantic and post-romantic styles in a thoroughly contemporary idiom\\" (Slonimsky 1991). Calligaris' composing career soared after the welcoming reception of Renzo’s piano notebook, with commissions from various musical institutions (the Symphonic dances, Op. 26, for example, by the Teatro Bellini in Catania). A prolific composer (his last works are Imagenes for string orchestra op. 54 and Allegro brutale con pavana op. 55 for four-hand piano or two pianos ad libitum),The first performances of these two works took place in 2012 in Rocca di Mezzo and Ancona (Italy) respectively. Calligaris has been able to produce steadily without making any concession on the quality, rigour, beauty and originality of his music.See again Zurletti's critique on this point (note no. 6). This ‘no-compromise’ approach is thought to be an important element of his music's success.Celletti's comment in . Beside the production for piano (which ultimately led to a fruitful cooperation with pianist and director Vladimir Ashkenazy),The sonata op. 38 for clarinet and piano is dedicated to him; Ashkenazy performed the premiere of this piece in duo with his son in 2001. Calligaris wrote for a variety of instruments (voice, cello, trumpet, organ, clarinet, flute, violin, horn) and for both chamber and symphonic orchestras. The majority of his compositions have been recorded by several artists.The latest anthological release (2007), entitled ...Rigor Y Pasión... is by the Italian label DAD Records (Home page ); relevant reviews (in Italian) may be found at Ass. Mus. Aulos (Calligaris CD). For details of other recordings see Discography. In 2007, Sergio Calligaris has been awarded the International Prize \\"Giuseppe Verdi\\" in recognition of his activity as both performer and composer.SabaudiaIn article Calligaris' composition are published by Carisch. Between 2008 and 2009 Carisch has issued four anthological volumes entitled Piano Parnassum, which collect most of his works for piano (the fourth volume includes compositions for four hands)..

Conflict continued after the fall of Kazan, however, as rebel governments formed in Çalım and Mişätamaq, and a new khan was invited from the Nogais. This guerrilla war lingered until 1556. ==Background== During the existence of the khanate (1438-1552) Russian forces besieged Kazan at least ten times (1469, 1478, 1487, 1506, 1524, 1530, 1545, 1547, 1549-1550, 1552). In 1547 and in 1549-1550, Ivan the Terrible besieged Kazan, but supply difficulties forced him to withdraw. The Russians pulled back and built the town or fort of Sviyazhsk. They also annexed land west of the Volga which weakened the khanate. The peace party agreed to accept the pro-Russian Shah Ali as khan. The patriotic party regained power, Shah Ali fled and Yadegar Mokhammad of Kazan was called in as khan. Religious leaders like Qolsharif inspired the people to a determined resistance. ==The siege== The Russian forces included streltsy as well as Moscow and Qasim irregular feudal cavalry, but the Muscovite artillery and sappers, both Russian and foreigners, played a vital role. At first they faced the Tatar garrison of Kazan, 10,000 Nogay horsemen led by the khan of Kazan, Yadegar Mokhammad, who originated from the Nogai Horde. Cheremiss units and Kazan irregular feudal cavalry had bases in forests north and east of Kazan respectively, with the stronghold of Archa as their base. Before the battle Russians had a fortress on the Volga, Ivangorod, later known as Sviyazhsk, some kilometres above Kazan. The Russian military engineer Ivan Vyrodkov had built this wooden fortress in 1551, when after the conclusion of peace, the right bank of the Khanate (Taw yağı) had passed to Russia. It would serve as a strong point for the capture of Kazan by the Muscovite army. The 150,000 Muscovite army under Ivan the Terrible came under Kazan's walls and besieged Kazan on August 22, 1552 (Old Style). Russian cannons shelled the walls from 29 August. Soon they smothered the fire of large-calibre Tatar cannons. During the period from 30 August to 6 September Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky defeated the inner cavalry under Yapancha and the Ar units and burned Archa. Andrey Kurbsky defeated Cheremis troops. Sappers blew up the underground way to Kazan's underground drinking-water source. Ivan Vyrodkov built on site a 12-metre-high wooden siege tower (also called a \\"battery-tower\\", to distinguish it from pre- gunpowder siege engines) to mount siege cannon. This revolutionary new design could hold ten large-calibre cannon and 50 lighter cannon, allowing a concentration of artillery fire on a section of the earthen-filled wooden wall of the city; this played a crucial role in shattering Tatar resistance. However, the few cannon defending Kazan had first to be put out of action for the tower to be effective, as it would otherwise have become an obvious target for the remaining Tatar artillery.Russian Fortresses, 1480–1682 , Osprey Publishing, On 2 October, sappers (believed to have been led by the Englishman Butler, also known as Rozmysl in Russian chronicles) blew up the wall near the Nogay and Atalıq Gates. Russian soldiers entered the city; the civil population as well as the army of Kazan opposed them. After desperate slashing, some survivors were blockaded in the citadel. Then, after the capture of khan Yadegar Moxammad and of Nogai leader Zaynash, the defenders of the citadel tried to escape to the northern forests, but they were defeated. A number of Russians who had been captured in military campaigns from the Russian borderland and held captive in the Khanate were released, and a large massacre of Kazan Tatars took place, as well as the destruction of almost all Tatar buildings, including mosques. Before the siege, Ivan IV encouraged his army with examples of Queen Tamar of Georgia's battles,История русской литературы, Дмитрий Дмитриевич Благой, Volume 1, p208 describing her as: \\"The most wise Queen of Iberia, endowed with the intelligence and courage of a man\\".History of the Georgian nation, Kalistrat Salia, p189 ==Aftermath== 18,000 men were left as a garrison and Ivan returned to Moscow to celebrate. After the fall of Kazan, resistance continued in the countryside. The tribes refused to pay taxes. Russian merchants were killed, which led to reprisals. The forts of Çalım and Mişätamaq were built on the west and east sides of the Volga. The Nogai Ali Akram was brought in as khan. Soltikov marched against Mişätamaq but he and 500 men were surrounded in the snow and killed. Ivan sent a larger force. There was daily fighting in the snow and forests. Ten thousand men were killed, six thousand were captured along with fifteen thousand women and children. 1600 leading Tatars were put to death. The leaders Yepancha and Aleka were killed. Ali Akram proved incompetent and was killed by Mameshbirde. Mameshbirde was betrayed to the Russians. The fort of Mişätamaq fell at some point. After the fall of Çalım in 1556 most resistance came to an end. In 1556 the Russians went down the Volga and conquered the Khanate of Astrakhan. In 1558 Anikey Stroganov was granted large lands on the Kama River northeast of Kazan, which he worked to develop. In 1582 the Stroganovs were involved in the conquest of the Khanate of Sibir east of the Urals. The Kazan Tatars continued to live in the area and retained their language and religion. The tsarist administration prohibited the Tatars, Chuvash and Mari from settling along rivers and in cities, and also from engaging in blacksmith and jewelry crafts.[1] Settlements in the specified zone were destroyed or relocated.[2] After his conquest of Kazan, Ivan IV is said to have ordered the crescent, a symbol of Islam, to be placed underneath the Christian cross on the domes of Orthodox Christian churches. == Cultural resonance == Siege of Kazan *Mikhail Kheraskov recounted the capture of Kazan in his epic poem, the ' (1771-1779). *Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow commemorates the conquest of Kazan. ==Gallery== File:Korovin kazan.jpgIvan IV under the walls of Kazan Image:Firinat xalikov war.jpgQolsharif and his students defend their madrassa and the Cathedral Mosque.

With the advent of Systems Network Architecture (SNA), NCP was enhanced to connect cluster controllers (such as the IBM 3270) to application programs using TCAM and later to application programs using Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM).

A PU4 usually had SDLC links to remote cluster controllers (PU1/PU2) or to other PU4s. Polling and addressing of the cluster controllers was performed by the NCP without mainframe intervention.

Satanists, Sects of the Latter Day Saint movement, Yakuzas, Triads, and Thuggees were popular choices. In the twentieth century concern for the rights and feelings of religious minorities led authors to invent fictional cults for their villains to belong to.

NRMs may be novel in origin or they may be part of a wider religion, in which case they will be distinct from pre-existing denominations.T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \\"Unit 13: Social Psychology.\\" pp 320 (PDF) Scholars continue to try to reach definitions and define boundaries. A NRM may be one of a wide range of movements ranging from those with loose affiliations based on novel approaches to spirituality or religion to communitarian enterprises that demand a considerable amount of group conformity and a social identity that separates their adherents from mainstream society.Coney, J. (1998) “A response to Religious Liberty in Western Europe by Massimo Introvigne” ISKON Communications Journal, 5(2) Scholars have estimated that NRM's now number in the tens of thousands worldwide, with most in Asia and Africa. Most have only a few members, some have thousands, and only very few have more than a million.Eileen Barker, 1999, \\"New Religious Movements: their incidence and significance\\", New Religious Movements: challenge and response, Bryan Wilson and Jamie Cresswell editors, Routledge The word cult in current usage is a pejorative term for a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre by the larger society, often without a clear or consistent definition.OED, citing American Journal of Sociology 85 (1980), p. 1377: \\"Cults[...], like other deviant social movements, tend to recruit people with a grievance, people who suffer from a some variety of deprivation.\\"Dr. Chuck Shaw - Sects and Cults - Greenville Technical College - Retrieved 21 March 2013. == Literature == === Early twentieth century === Zane Grey, in his Riders of the Purple Sage (1912), a Western novel that would have a major influence on Hollywood, lambasts the Mormons and has his gunslinger hero rescue a wealthy young woman in the early 1870s from the clutches of elderly polygamists via exceedingly bloody gunfights. The novel contains a portrayal of the psychological conflicts of the young woman, raised a Mormon but gradually coming to the realization that she wants a supposedly less constricted life. (The Mormon misdeeds depicted in the story take place on the southern frontier of Utah, and Grey makes no suggestion of the involvement of Mormon leaders in Salt Lake City.) The harassment of the young woman reflects a popular literary theme in Queen Victoria's England. In Dashiell Hammett's The Dain Curse (1929), much of the mystery puzzle revolves around the Temple of the Holy Grail, a fictitious California circle that Hammett's characters repeatedly describe as a \\"cult\\". Hammett depicts it as starting as a scam, although the putative leader begins to believe in his own fraudulent claims. A.E.W. Mason, in The Prisoner in the Opal (1928), one of his Inspector Hanaud mysteries, describes the unmasking of a Satanist cult. The Italian novelist Sibilla Aleramo, in Amo, dunque sono (I Love, Therefore, I Am) (1927) depicted Julius Evola's UR Group, a hermetical circle and intellectual movement — strongly influenced by Anthroposophy — that attempted to provide a spiritual direction to Benito Mussolini's fascism. Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity. New York University Press, 2002. Aleramo described the character based on her former lover Evola as \\"inhuman, an icy architect of acrobatic theories, vain, vicious, perverse.\\" Aleramo based her hero on Giulio Parise, who would unsuccessfully attempt to oust the pro-Fascist Evola as the circle's leader in 1928, resulting in an announcement by Evola that he would thenceforth exert \\"an absolute unity of direction\\" over the circle's publications., \\"Julius Evola and the UR Group,\\" preface to Introduction to Magic: Rituals and Practical Techniques for the Magus (anthology of writings by Evola and his associates), trans. Guido Stucco, ed. Michael Jenkins Moynihan, Inner Traditions: Rochester, Vermont, 2001. ===Mid and late twentieth century=== Science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein wrote two novels that deal with fictional cult-like groups. A leading figure in his early \\"Future History\\" series (see If This Goes On--, a short novel published in Revolt in 2100), Nehemiah Scudder, a religious \\"prophet\\", becomes dictator of the United States. By his own admission in an afterword, Heinlein poured into this book his distrust of all forms of religious fundamentalism, the Ku Klux Klan, the Communist Party and other movements that he regarded as authoritarian. Heinlein also stated in the afterword that he had worked out the plot of other books about Scudder, but had decided not to write them — in part because he found Scudder so unpleasant. Heinlein's novel Stranger in a Strange Land features two cults: the \\"Dionysian Church of the New Revelation, Fosterite\\", and the protagonist Valentine Michael Smith's own \\"Church of All Worlds\\". Heinlein treats of the motives and methods of religious leaders in some detail. In That Hideous Strength, C.S. Lewis describes the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments, or \\"NICE\\", a quasi-governmental front concealing a kind of doomsday cult that worships a disembodied head kept alive by scientific means. Lewis' novel is notable for its elaboration of his 1944 address \\"The Inner Ring.\\" The latter work criticizes the lust to \\"belong\\" to a powerful clique — a common human failing that Lewis believed was the basis for people being seduced into power-hungry and spiritually twisted movements. In William Campbell Gault's Sweet Wild Wench, L.A. private eye Joe Puma investigates the \\"Children of Proton\\", a fictional cult that has attracted the support of the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Gore Vidal's Messiah depicts the rise of a cult leader, while Vidal's Kalki, a science-fiction novel, recounts how a small but scientifically adept cult kills off the entire human race by means of germ warfare. ===Twenty-first century=== Popular French author Michel Houellebecq's 2005 science-fiction novel, The Possibility of an Island, describes a cloning group that resembles the Raëlians. \\"Le roman de Michel Houellebecq, sorti le 31 août, met en scène une secte triomphante, qui resemble fort à celle des raëliens, alors que l'auteur prédit la mort des grandes religions monothéistes. Il a choisi la secte des raëliens parce qu'\\"elle est adaptée aux temps modernes, à la civilisation des loisirs, elle n'impose aucune contrainte morale et, surtout, elle promet l'immortalité.\\" [TRANSLATION: \\"Michel Houellebecq's novel, appearing on 31 August, depicts a victorious cult, strongly resembling that of the Raëlians, while the author predicts the death of the great monotheist religions. He chose the Raëlian cult because \\"it has adapted to modern times, to the leisure civilization. it imposes no moral constraint and, above all, it promises immortality.\\"] Robert Muchamore has written a book for teenagers, Divine Madness, about a religious cult that has a vast number of members: the main characters of the book must infiltrate the cult to discover a sinister plot. The novel Godless centers around a teenager who forms a religious cult that worships his hometown's water tower. === Literary works by founders of new trends or movements === Aleister Crowley, founder of the English-speaking branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis and of a short-lived commune (the \\"Abbey of Thelema\\") in Sicily, wrote poetry (anthologized in 1917 in The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse) and novels (Diary of a Drug Fiend (1922) and Moonchild (1929)). Crowley died in 1947. His autobiography, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, republished in 1969, attracted much attention. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy describes Crowley's fiction and his manuals on the occult as examples of \\"lifestyle fantasy\\".See \\"Crowley, Aleister\\" entry in John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1997. The travel-writer, poet and painter Nicholas Roerich, the founder of Agni Yoga, expressed his spiritual beliefs through his depiction of the stark mountains of Central Asia. His classic travel-books include Heart of Asia: Memoirs from the Himalayas (1929) and Shambhala: In Search of the New Era (1930). L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, worked as a contributing author in the Golden Age of Science Fiction (1930s to 1950s) and in the horror and fantasy genres. In a bibliographical study of his works, Marco Frenschkowski agrees with Stephen King in regarding Fear (1940) as one of the major horror tales of the 20th century, and praises \\"its imaginative use of the prosaic and its demythologizing of traditional weird fiction themes\\". Other works which Frenschkowski cites as notable include Typewriter in the Sky (1940), To the Stars (1950), the best-selling Battlefield Earth (1982), and the ten-volume Mission Earth (1985–1987). Frenschkowski concludes that although Hubbard's fiction has received excessive praise from his followers, science-fiction critics leery of Scientology have underrated it.Marco Frenschkowski, \\"L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology\\" (annotated bibliographical survey), Marburg Journal of Religion, 4:1, July 1999. John Clute and Peter Nichols, however, manage to praise much of Hubbard's oeuvre while also raising questions about the thematic link to Scientology. Hubbard's \\"canny utilization of superman protagonists\\" in his early work, they argue, came to \\"tantalize\\" s-f writers and fans \\"with visions of transcendental power\\" and may explain why so many early followers of Hubbard's movement came from the s-f community.\\"L. Ron Hubbard\\" entry in John Clute and Peter Nichols, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, second ed., New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1993. G.I. Gurdjieff, the Greek-Armenian mystic and spiritual teacher who introduced and taught the Fourth Way, authored three literary works that comprise his All and Everything trilogy. The best known, Meetings with Remarkable Men, a memoir of Gurdjieff's youthful search for spiritual truth, has become a minor classic. Peter Brook made it into a film (1979). The trilogy also includes Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson, a curious melange of philosophy, humor and science-fiction that some regard as a masterpiece. P.L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins series and a disciple of Gurdjieff, described Beelzebub as \\"soaring off into space, like a great, lumbering flying cathedral\\".\\"Gurdjieff,\\" in Man, Myth and Magic: Encyclopedia of the Supernatural, London: Purnell, 1970-71 (gurdjieff.org) Martin Seymour-Smith included Beelzebub in his 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written, characterising it as \\"...the most convincing fusion of Eastern and Western thought that has yet been seen.\\" Gurdjieff's final volume, Life is Real Only Then, When 'I Am', consists of an incomplete text published posthumously. Eli Siegel, the founder of Aesthetic Realism, wrote highly regarded poetry. William Carlos Williams described his \\"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\\" (1925)HotAfternoons (Republished in Siegel's 1957 book of the same name: Siegel, Eli. Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana, New York: Definitions Press, 1957) as his \\"major poem\\", and wrote that Siegel \\"belongs in the first ranks of our living artists\\".William Carlos Williams, \\"Letter to Martha Baird,\\" in Breslin, J.E.B., ed., Something to Say, New York: New Directions, 1985 Other critics and poets who praised Siegel's work included Selden RodmanSelden Rodman, Review of \\"Hot Afternoons,\\" Saturday Review, 17 August 1957 and Kenneth Rexroth; the latter wrote that \\"it's about time Eli Siegel was moved up into the ranks of our acknowledged Leading Poets.\\"Rexroth, New York Times Book Review, March 23, 1969 ===Important non-fiction writers among founders of movements=== Helena Blavatsky, the Russian adventuress who founded Theosophy, wrote Isis Unveiled (1887) and The Secret Doctrine (1888), and had an immense cultural and intellectual influence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, helping to stimulate the Indian nationalist movement, parapsychology, the fantasy literary genre, See \\"Blavatsky, Helena\\" and \\"Theosophy\\" entries in John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1997 and the New Age movement. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy describes her two major books as \\"enormous, entrancing honeypots of myth, fairytale, speculation, fabrication and tomfoolery\\". \\"Theosophy\\" in John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1997 Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), the founder of Anthroposophy, wrote in a variety of fields (his collected works total 350 volumes) and influenced such figures as the novelist Herman Hesse and the philosopher Owen Barfield. Through his writings and lectures, Steiner stimulated the development of the cooperative movement, alternative medicine, organic farming, the Waldorf schools, and \\"eurythmy\\" in modern dance. == Films == (Chronological) *The British film The Stranglers of Bombay (1959), directed by Terence Fisher, features a Thuggee cult as a villain *The British film Help!

WUVT-FM is licensed to Virginia Tech and is operated by The Educational Media Company at Virginia Tech. ==History== WUVT, in one form or another, has been located on the campus of Virginia Tech for more than 60 years, making it one of the longest running radio stations in Virginia. It originally began operation as an AM station in 1948 after a student created an AM transmitter in his dorm room. WUVT-FM was established in 1969. Today, like other student media organizations on campus, WUVT is a division of The Educational Media Company at Virginia Tech. WUVT is known for its eclectic programming, covering a wide swath of past and present music styles. DJs are typically students (and former students), who select content based upon their personal preferences. WUVT serves the community by providing an educational and cultural experience, offering music rarely heard on commercial stations. WUVT's studios and offices are located in Squires Student Center. Its transmitter is located on nearby Price Mountain, between Blacksburg and Radford, at a site shared with WBRW, \\"The Bear\\". The station currently transmits its signal with a Harris Z5CD solid state transmitter donated by Clear Channel. Former WUVT Chief Engineer Kevin Sterne was injured in the April 16, 2007 killing spree by a Virginia Tech student. After hearing about Kevin’s strong passion for the radio station and WUVT's need to upgrade its aging transmitter, officials from Clear Channel and the Society of Broadcast Engineers assisted in returning WUVT to full power on April 28, 2007. Clear Channel donated a Harris Z5CD transmitter, transmitter building, and antenna sufficient to generate 10 KW. Orban, CBS Radio, and Electronics Research, Inc. (ERI) also offered equipment and technical assistance. ==Power Increase== Virginia Radio and TV website VARTV.com reported in 2007 that WUVT \\"has requested to move its antenna off- campus to a new location a mile away from and increase the antenna height from 141 feet to 429 feet. WUVT wants to be licensed as a Class C3 (from Class A) and increase its power from 3,000 watts to 10,000 watts.\\" In June 2008, WUVT received authorization from the FCC to begin building a 6.5 kW transmission facility. This construction permit was issued for a lower power that originally requested due to a conflicting application with WEHC. Both stations filed applications for power increases which would have overlapped, so both WUVT and WEHC have compromised and re-submitted their applications at a lower power. Over summer 2009, WUVT moved equipment to the new site atop Price Mountain and removed the old transmitter from its location atop Lee Hall. During the transitional period, WUVT broadcast at low power from Squires Student Center. In September 2009, the station received permission to begin broadcasting at 6.5 kW ERP. ==Technical Accomplishments== * June 1969 - FM transmission authorized on 90.7 MHz with 10 watts ERP * 1970s - Upgraded license to 770 watts ERP, on the air with the original 10W exciter driving a 430W amplifier. The amplifier was hand built and FCC type accepted by Geoff Mendenhall, a student at Ga Tech who used it for a few years at their station.

On November 19, 2006, Burger King started selling it for an additional $3.99 USD ($4.99 in Canada) with any value meal. It is one of three titles released by Burger King. ==Overview== The game, based on pocketbike racing, features customizable bikes and drivers. Players can choose one of five tracks to race on: a Burger King restaurant parking lot, a construction site, a neighborhood, the King's garden or the fabled Fantasy Ranch set. The game can be played solo, with up to four players in split-screen set-up, or up to eight online using Xbox Live. The game contains a track from Miami retro-punk band The Dead Hookers' Bridge Club. Brooke Burke is featured on the cover of PocketBike Racer, as well as being a playable character within the game. PocketBike Racer, Sneak King, and Big Bumpin' were all created in just seven months and were considered to be of such high quality that they were pulled from Xbox Live Arcade to be sold as a 'box product' directly in Burger King stores (they are currently only available in America and Canada). == Development == The origin of three Burger King-themed Xbox Games came about in Cannes when senior executives from Microsoft and Burger King met at the awards for the I Love Bees and Subservient Chicken advertising campaigns. Microsoft wanted the Xbox games to be fun for the players and that the environment would be a Burger King-themed context not be reduced to simply pushing its brand. In the fall of 2005, Blitz Games entered into talks with Burger King and the development team began work in February 2006. In an interview with Gamasutra, Philip Oliver stated that he was talking with Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade portfolio manager, Ross Erickson and had an interest in developing Xbox Live games, but lacked funding as an independent developer. During Oliver and Erickson's talks, Erickson agree to notify Oliver of any leads on advertisers looking for product placement in video games. A week or two after that, Oliver received a call from Erickson about Burger King's interest in creating three games. Gamasutra's interviewer, Brandon Sheffield, noted the odd choice of an American company using a British developer, but Oliver explained that Burger King was familiar with their first Xbox release Fuzion Frenzy. The development began as Xbox Live games, but Burger King wanted the games to also be playable on the Xbox, but the console platform was not able to access Xbox Live Arcade. Burger King decided to have them as boxed games which would require the customer to come into the store to obtain the game. When advised of the difficulty in the production, Burger King explained that it would be able to get approval from Microsoft and that both the Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game should be available on the same disc. Blitz Games assigned two project managers for the games, Chris Swan and John Jarvis, who held daily conference calls with Burger King and Microsoft's Xbox division throughout the project. Blitz Games worked on increasing communication between the companies by showing the development process for a previous game, from \\"first the black and white sketches, then the color concepts, environment blockouts, texturing and lighting, and finally the results on screen.\\" By laying out a previous workflow process, Blitz Games helped to bridged the advertising presentation gap Burger King's marketers; a failure of which could have \\"crippled the project.\\" Burger King and Blitz Games held daily conference calls to review the designs and Burger King was most concerned with the positive portrayal of the characters. The Blitz Games staff of fifteen people working on the original Xbox 360 games grew to nearly sixty persons after Burger King increased the contract and budget for the games. In total, 80 developers were involved in the project. The task of producing two different versions were made easier by Blitz Games' production toolchain that had built-in compatibility for Xbox and the developers able to adjust the game with appropriate hardware coding that had already been previously developed by the company. During the end of each month of the development, the builds of the games were provided to Microsoft as required of all developers. Both masters of the games are included on the discs, Oliver guesses that the Xbox and Xbox360 were able to launch the specific executable based on file name because each disc contains two separate masters and two separate sets of assets. Oliver judged that the Xbox 360's graphics were twice as good as the Xbox, but was far from utilizing the full performance of the Xbox360 hardware. Tasked with creating three games, Blitz Games managed to get an extra month to develop the game due to the challenges involved in the production and a second month after Microsoft agreed to \\"fast track\\" the games through the Quality Assurance process. Oliver summed it up by stating \\"But we still had to effectively do three original games, two (Stock keeping units) of each, in seven months. Scary, but we did it! They're all mastered, they're all in production, and there’s going to be two million units of each disc.\\" ==Release== PocketBike Racer was one of three promotional Burger King-themed releases for winter 2006, the other two games were Sneak King and Big Bumpin'. The Burger King-only marketing run was from November 19 through December 24, 2006. The games were available for $3.99 with any purchase of any Burger King value meal. Destructoid later noted that the cost of the games were later reduced to $0.99 in February 2007. In January 2007, the marketing firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky stated that more than 2.7 million games were sold in the promotion. It was reported that more than 3.2 million copies were sold, PocketBike Racer sales by itself were not given, in Game Developers April 2007 issue. ==Reception and impact== X-Play reviewed all three Burger King games together, with PocketBike Racer leading with a three out of five stars. However, Greg Sewart noted that the game had some glitches and was less fun than that of the Mario Kart series. IGN, on the other hand, considered it to be the worst of the three, claiming its only fun aspect is \\"playing as a giant hamburger\\" . Phil Villarreal gave it a 3 out of 10 and wrote that \\"[t]he racing is good for a little cheap fun, and the blatant in-game advertising - one of the courses has you speed through a BK drive-through - yields a few laughs, but then you'll feel like discarding it like a Whopper wrapper.\\" The immediate impact of the project on Blitz Games was the financial boost it provided, it allowed the company to improve its technology and it also partially funded Blitz Games' Blitz Arcade. Collectively, the games were enough to be ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Story wrote, \\"Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30-second commercials[.]\\" The success of the project, including PocketBike Racer, was noted as a key part of Burger King's 40% increase in sales during the quarter and it was affirmed by Russell Klein that Burger King attributed the majority of that success to the project. ==See also== * Dash of Destruction * 'Yaris (video game) ==References== *Pocketbike Racer on IGN, IGN.com, retrieved November 4, 2006 *Burger King and Xbox Team Up, IGN.com, retrieved November 4, 2006 *First look at the trio of Burger King games, SiliconEra, retrieved November 4, 2006 *GameSpy profile for Pocketbike Racer, GameSpy, retrieved November 4, 2006 *Static Multimedia review for Pocketbike Racer, Static Multimedia, retrieved February 15, 2007 ==External links== Category:Burger King advertising Category:2006 video games Category:Advergames Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Burger King Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Racing video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"PocketBike Racer"},{"id":"7775366","text":"The Atatürkist Thought Association (; ADD) is a secularist organization that espouses the ideas of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey.

It was written primarily in 2004 after the release of The Get Up Kids album Guilt Show while that band was on its world tour.Alternative Press Issue 204 \\"Say Goodnight, Mean Goodbye: The Oral History of The Get Up Kids\\" Several songs, chiefly \\"Wears so Thin\\" and \\"Watch the World Cave In\\" were written about the tensions in the band at the time that led to the group's eventual breakup. In fact, the song \\"Drinking in the Afternoon\\" was written in a hotel room during the Japan leg of the tour the night before Pryor quit the band after the tour was over. The events surrounding the album's writing led to a much darker and foreboding tone than on previous releases. ==Production== After The Get Up Kids went on hiatus after their 2004 world tour, Pryor turned his focus to The New Amsterdams, who started recording the first version of Killed or Cured. They initially recorded a more stripped-down acoustic version of the album, with many songs featuring only Pryor on vocals and guitar. In 2005, The Get Up Kids formally announced their breakup, and that they would be doing one final tour before splitting up permanently on June 2. Because of this Vagrant Records, the label to which both The Get Up Kids and The New Amsterdams were signed, wanted to hold off on the release of Killed or Cured, as it would reflect poorly on The Get Up Kids due to the mood of when it was written. Soon afterward, the band released the album online for free download, including cover art, from the band's website. They also returned to the studio to re- record the album for its retail release. The new version of the album is substantially different from the original, with each song featuring the full band and, in some cases, strings and brass. This new version was produced by Ed Rose, a longtime friend who had also produced several albums by The Get Up Kids, as well as other side-projects like Reggie and the Full Effect and White Whale.

Marie in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I-75 begins its national northward journey near Miami, running along the western parts of the Miami metropolitan area before traveling westward across Alligator Alley (also known as Everglades Parkway Excerpted in ), resuming its northward direction in Naples, running along Florida's Gulf Coast, and passing the cities of Fort Myers, Punta Gorda, Venice, and Sarasota. The freeway passes through the Tampa Bay Area before turning inward towards Ocala, Gainesville, and Lake City before leaving the state and entering Georgia. I-75 runs for in Florida, making it the longest Interstate in the state and also the longest in any state east of the Mississippi River. The Interstate maintains a speed limit of for its entire length in Florida. The portion of I-75 from Tampa northward was a part of the original 1955 Interstate Highway plans, with I-75's southern terminus at I-4's current western terminus. Planning to extend the Interstate south to Miami began in 1968 after massive growth in Southwest Florida, which resulted in I-75 being realigned to travel on the eastern fringes of the Tampa Bay area, and the last portion of the highway was opened in 1993. For FDOT inventory purposes, it is designated as State Road 93 (SR 93) for most of its length in Florida (with exception to the Tampa Bay area, where SR 93 follows I-275, while SR 93A travels with I-75 in the latter's bypass of the area). ==Route description== The south end of I-75 near Miami ===South Florida=== I-75 begins its northward journey at an interchange with SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway) and SR 924 (Gratigny Parkway) on the Hialeah–Miami Lakes border, near Miami. As it curves around the border of Miami Lakes, I-75 serves some of the western fringes of South Florida as an eight-lane highway. After an exit with SR 860, I-75 has an interchange with the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike before crossing into Broward County. There, it continues through the western suburbs of Pembroke Pines, Weston, Miramar, Davie, and Southwest Ranches. At the junction of SR 869 (Sawgrass Expressway) and I-595, I-75 (while maintaining its south–north status) enters a west–east trajectory as it crosses the Everglades by way of Alligator Alley, a toll road that runs from the Collier Boulevard (Exit 101) toll plaza to the US-27 toll plaza (Exit 23). It was originally constructed as a two-lane highway before it was converted to a four-lane highway meeting Interstate Highway standards. At this point, I-75 loses a lane in each direction, heading west, losing another lane west of the U.S. Route 27 (US 27) interchange. ===The Everglades and Southwest Florida=== Aerial view of I-75 through Alligator Alley The Alligator Alley section of I-75 runs due east-west between exit 19 in Sunrise, FL and exit 101 just east of Naples and is one of only two sections along the Interstate’s entirety that is tolled (the other is the Mackinac Bridge in northern Michigan). Tolls are $3.25 for a 2-axle vehicle as of March 1, 2020 and are collected in both directions. The highway’s toll plazas accept (as of March 1, 2020) both cash and transponders in the SunPass network and are located at either entrance to Alligator Alley. All toll facilities along Alligator Alley and toll revenue collected from them are overseen by the Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE), a government agency which is part of the Florida Department of Transportation. There are a mere two interchanges along the tolled portion of Alligator Alley in addition to three rest areas and a number of scenic outlook points as the highway crosses the Florida Everglades. I-75 enters Collier County along Alligator Alley just west of the Snake Road exit (exit 49) and passes through the Big Cypress National Preserve between the Collier County border and State Road 29 (exit 80). There are a number of small bridges along Alligator Alley which allow wildlife to pass safely under the freeway, especially along the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge east of SR 29. Extensive fencing also prevents wildlife from interfering with traffic. As it approaches Naples at County Road 951 (Exit 101), I-75 makes a sharp turn north resuming its south–north trajectory and as it parallels Florida's west coast, it becomes six lanes hereafter to the Georgia state line. At this point, Alligator Alley ends and I-75 is toll free for the rest of its length in Florida. As it continues north, I-75 passes near Bonita Springs, Fort Myers, Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte, Venice, and Sarasota before reaching the Tampa Bay Area metropolis consisting of Tampa and St. Petersburg. ===Tampa Bay area=== I-75 southbound at exit 256 (SR 618) in Brandon North of Ellenton, I-275 splits from I-75 to serve St. Petersburg and Pinellas County via the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and Tampa via the Howard Frankland Bridge. I-75 parallels the eastern shore of Tampa Bay as a bypass route of the Tampa Bay Area, as it passes by the communities of Brandon, Temple Terrace, and New Tampa. Two expressways access downtown Tampa from I-75: the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway (SR 618) and I-4. Within the Tampa Bay Metropolitan Area, many interchanges are far more complex than mere diamond, cloverleaf, or even SPUI interchanges. Aside from the large turbine interchange with I-4 (Exit 261), there are interchanges with Fowler Avenue (Exit 265) and Fletcher Avenue/Morris Bridge Road (Exit 266) that contain both loops and flyovers. A flyover ramp was built from southbound Bruce B. Downs Boulevard (Exit 270) to southbound I-75. ===Northern Florida=== Pasco County At the Hillsborough–Pasco county line (south of SR 56 (Exit 275)), I-275 rejoins I-75 (at Exit 274, southbound only) and I-75 changes into a southwest–northeast trajectory as it passes through Pasco, Hernando, and Sumter Counties where it runs through parts of the Withlacoochee State Forest on its way to the junction with Florida's Turnpike (exit 328, accessible from southbound I-75 only (although northbound travelers can access the Turnpike from I-75's exit 329 and follow SR 44 to the Turnpike's exit 304)). Widened median segments exist in Northern Pasco County, Hernando County, and in Sumter County north of County Road 476-B (Exit 309). Some of these median segments are actually considered part of the Withlacoochee State Forest itself. The Withlacoochee State Trail runs beneath I-75 between US 98/SR 50 (Exit 301) and the Hernando–Sumter County line, where it also crosses over the Withlacoochee River. All of Interstate 75 from the Georgia border to Tampa, Florida is three lanes in each direction, unless closed for construction. This is to accommodate for the immense number of tourists and vacationers that come to Florida. The Cross Florida Greenway bridge over I-75 After Florida's Turnpike, I-75 changes into a general southeast–northwest trajectory, which is sustained to the Georgia state line and beyond. I-75 passes beneath the Cross Florida Greenway, which contains a land bridge built across the highway in 2001 between Exits 341 and 350, before entering the City of Ocala, and passing by the cities of Gainesville and Lake City and crosses I-10 at an interchange before entering the state of Georgia, near Valdosta. I-75 crossing the Suwannee River, with a snippet of music from \\"Old Folks at Home\\" I-75 runs closest to US 41 except between Tampa and High Springs. It runs closer to US 301 between Ellenton and Temple Terrace, and again from Dade City to Sparr. From Belleview to Lake City it runs closest to US 441. ==History== The original plans called for I-75 to end in Tampa. ===Original route to Tampa=== Original plans for I-75 called for its southern terminus to be in Tampa, where it would terminate at I-4 (at the current interchange between I-4 and I-275, with I-4, which was completed in the Bay area by 1962, continuing west along what is now I-275 over the Howard Frankland Bridge into St. Petersburg). Plans for I-75 from Tampa to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan were authorized as part of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, which created the Interstate Highway System. Construction of the original route from the Georgia border to Tampa via Gainesville and Ocala lasted through most of the 1960s. The first segment of I-75 to open in Florida was from the Georgia border to State Road 6 just south of Jennings, which opened in 1963. It would reach U.S. 90 in Lake City later that year. By mid-1964, I-75 opened from Lake City to the newly completed Florida's Turnpike (known then as the Sunshine State Parkway) in Wildwood. Segments of the original route that are now part of I-275 near Tampa would begin opening in 1966, and construction of the full route would be completed by 1969. ===Extension to Miami=== Due to major growth in Southwest Florida (particularly Fort Myers and Naples), it was becoming clear that this part of the state would soon need a freeway. Florida's state government first proposed to build a West Coast Turnpike in 1964 from the Tampa Bay area south to Naples. Plans for the West Coast Turnpike (which would have been tolled) were cancelled in 1968, when it was announced that U.S. Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd had approved an extension of I-75 south to Naples and then east to Miami. The Federal Government would pay for 90% of the extension using funds allocated by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, which was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In preparation for the extension, I-75's designation was extended along the pre-existing route of I-4 over the Howard Frankland Bridge into St. Petersburg by the end of 1969 (I-4's designation would be truncated to its current terminus at this time). From St. Petersburg, I-75 was proposed to continue south over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and continue south along a new freeway roughly parallel to the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41) along the lower Gulf Coast to Naples. 80px I-75E shields As the extension was planned in 1968, plans were also made for a freeway bypassing Tampa Bay to the east. The bypass was initially planned to be designated I-75E, and was to split from I-75 near Wesley Chapel and rejoin it just north of Ellenton. However, in 1972, it was determined that maintaining the main route of I-75 through Downtown Tampa would eventually require major improvements to the existing infrastructure to handle through traffic. As a result, it was decided that I-75 would instead follow the bypass route. FDOT could have renumbered I-75E into what could have possibly been I-75W, but due to a 1973-based AASHTO rule indicating that suffixed routes were to be renumbered to reduce motorist confusion, the option of renumbering I-75E into I-75W was scrapped. Instead, the I-75E designation was renumbered to what is known today as I-275, and both the I-75 and I-275 designations were swapped into their current configuration in 1973. I-75 reached as far south as 38th Avenue North in St. Petersburg when the designations were switched. Despite the designation switch, both freeways' hidden designations still reflect the originally planned routing, with I-75's SR 93 designation following I-275, and the current route of I-75 on the bypass being designated SR 93A. Construction on the bypass segment of I-75 began in 1979. The initially favored proposal for I-75 to reach Miami from Naples was to have I-75 run along the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41) across the Everglades to just east of the Palmetto Expressway where it would continue along SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway) and terminate at I-95 and I-395 in Downtown Miami. Planners made the decision in 1973 to shift I-75's proposed route to cross the Everglades along Alligator Alley over environmental concerns related to upgrading the Tamiami Trail, which runs along the northern border of Everglades National Park. Additionally, they deemed upgrading the Dolphin Expressway to Interstate standards to be highly expensive. By using this route, I-75 would run along the alley to the proposed Port Everglades Expressway, where it would turn south along a new freeway through the western suburbs of Weston and Pembroke Pines to Miami. It was still planned to continue east to I-95, but due to local opposition, I-75 was not built past its current terminus at SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway) in Hialeah. With this new route, the Port Everglades Expressway was then planned to be built as an Interstate highway designated I-595 to provide an Interstate connection between I-75 and I-95. The first piece of the south extension of I-75 to open was a short segment just east of Fort Myers from SR 78 south to Corkscrew Road in 1979. This piece would extend north to Tucker's Grade just south of Punta Gorda in early 1980 and south to Immokalee Road in North Naples by 1981. Also in 1981, the segment from U.S. 301 in Manatee County south to River Road near Venice opened, which would be completed south to the southern segment in Punta Gorda later that year. It would reach Alligator Alley in Naples by 1984. The route from Tampa to Naples would be complete by 1986 as segments of the Tampa bypass were opened from 1982 to 1986. In the Miami area, I-75 was opened from U.S. 27 to its terminus at the Palmetto Expressway in 1986. The Florida Department of Transportation transitioned existing interchange exit numbers on all Interstate highways from sequential exits to mileage-based exits in January 2002. ===Alligator Alley=== The Alligator Alley segment of I-75 extends from a toll plaza just east of Naples to an interchange with I-595 and the Sawgrass Expressway (SR-869 Toll) in Sunrise, FL, just west of Fort Lauderdale. The highway previously existed as a two-lane tollway connecting the two coasts of Florida. Initially known as the Everglades Parkway (State Road 84), it opened for traffic on February 11, 1968, after four years of construction. Built by H. L. Mills Construction Company, it had been called the most controversial roadway ever built in Florida during its initial construction. The name \\"Alligator Alley\\" was given by the American Automobile Association while it was being planned as they believed it would be useless to cars and merely an \\"alley for alligators\\". However, as alligators often frequent the waterways beside the road, and occasionally the roadway itself, the nickname has developed a somewhat literal meaning. The state moved to officially adopt the “Alligator Alley” name in 1966. As a two-lane road, Alligator Alley suffered from poor construction and environmental planning. It was also notorious for high-speed accidents including both head-on collisions and collisions with wildlife. The need to improve the road was one of the factors considered in the decision to reroute I-75 onto Alligator Alley, which was rebuilt as a four-lane Interstate highway between 1986 and 1992. Many bridges and culverts designed to let water and wildlife pass underneath the roadway and permit the natural flow of the Everglades’ waters were built as part of the upgrade. This helped to reduce the environmental impact of the highway somewhat, especially upon the severely endangered Florida panther. The completion of the converted Alligator Alley was the final link of the I-75 extension. The segment was signed Interstate 75 on November 25, 1992, completing the highway from Miami to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The highway is well-known for its predominantly flat character and the extraordinarily linear path the highway follows. In January 2000, the west end toll plaza of Alligator Alley was dedicated to the Memory of Edward J. Beck, a toll taker who was murdered on the job on January 30, 1974.http://archive.naplesnews.com/news/letter-honoring-my-dad- ep-313150829-341485401.html/ In April 2008, FDOT proposed a section of Alligator Alley to be leased to private operators. The additional revenue the state would receive was one of primary motives to privatize this section of Alligator Alley. However, the motion failed in May 2009 when no bids were received that met the required terms. ===Recent history=== FDOT contracted Prince Contracting in 2015 to construct the state's first diverging diamond interchange (DDI) at the University Parkway (Exit 213) interchange. The $74.5 million project started construction in August 2015 and completed in September 2017. The interchange handles more than 80,000 vehicles per day and reduced intersection delays by 50 percent. FDOT implemented express lanes along of the I-75 and SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway) corridors, from just south of the SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway), in Miami-Dade County, to I-595 in Broward County. The project completed another section of the South Florida managed lanes network for all motorists and improves mobility, relieves congestion, provides additional travel options and accommodate future growth in the area. The 75 Express Lanes project extends along I-75 from Northwest 170 Street, in Miami- Dade County, to I-595, in Broward County. Work was completed in four segments to minimize the effects on the public. Construction began in early 2014 and was completed in 2018. The total project cost $481 million. ==Future== Construction began in September 2016 to redesign the interchanges with the north end of Florida's Turnpike (Exit 328) and SR 44 (Exit 329), connecting them with collective-distributor roads, and eliminating left-hand access to Florida's Turnpike from the main southbound lane. This is a joint effort between the Florida's Turnpike Enterprise and Florida Department of Transportation. The new northbound off-ramp to SR 44 was completed on September 19, 2019, and the new southbound on-ramps to the Turnpike and I-75 were completed in early November 2019. Another interchange is planned for Overpass Road north of State Road 54, connecting to County Road 530. Many widening projects are underway on I-75 to eventually bring it to at least six lanes from Naples to the Georgia state line. ==Services== Several rest area facilities exist along I-75 throughout the state. In addition, there are separate facilities for each direction of the Interstate in Hamilton and Suwannee counties, southbound and northbound, respectively, and a welcome center south of the state line. Exit 131 has a single facility accessible from both travel directions on I-75, as well as the intersecting highway. Exit 161 had a rest stop at the interchange's southeast quadrant but it closed in 2015 because of low usage. Exit 191 also had a rest stop at the interchange's northeast quadrant that closed in the 1990s. Each rest area has rest rooms, vending machines, picnic tables, dog walk areas, and nighttime security. The welcome center also has travel information and free orange juice, the state's official state beverage. Motorist-aid call boxes were installed starting in 1973, initially from the Georgia line to Lake City, eventually being installed on both outside shoulders of the road every to allow drivers to indicate the need for gasoline, repair (tire or engine), or emergency services (police, ambulance, or fire). The majority of the call boxes were removed in late 2013 because of the rising maintenance cost and the availability of newer technology. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are used throughout the Interstate. ITS is a fiber optic system of traffic cameras, overhead message signs, microwave vehicle detectors, travel time sensors, road and weather information sensors, and highway advisory radios. FDOT has a data-share agreement with Waze which provides real-time information for the state's 5-1-1 service, ITS, and to Waze users. The Everglades Radio Network is a network of two low-power FM travelers information radio stations serving the Collier County segment of Alligator Alley in the Everglades region and based at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers. ==Exit list== ===Express lanes=== ==In literature== In John D.

They were first popularized at the beginning of the 19th century. Cravats were made of silk, satin, lace and lightly starched cambric, lawn and muslin, and stickpins were necessary accoutrements to keep these expensive fabrics in place and safe. Stickpins commonly used pearls and other precious gemstones set in gold or other precious metals and were designed specifically for their owners. By the 1860s, the English upper middle classes embraced wearing cravats with a consequently lower quality of materials and designs used in both the neckwear and in the stickpins used to keep it in place. By the 1870s, Americans had embraced stickpins and designs were mass-produced which included animal heads, horse shoes, knife and fork motifs, crossed pipes, wishbones, bugs, flowers, shields and a host of other figural motifs. By the 1890s, stickpins had crossed gender lines as women began wearing them with sporting outfits worn for bicycling, boating, horseback riding, tennis and golf. The Ascot, Four in Hand, Sailor scarf, cravat bow tie and wrapped scarf all became popular for both men and women, and all could be set off with an ornamental stickpin. Between 1894 and 1930 many patents were issued covering such issues as prong setting, ornament attachment, stickpin blanks, safety clutches, guards and decorations. One patent was for a brooch which could convert the center medallion to a stickpin. Another concealed a small lead pencil point attached to the shaft of the pin. Still another included a small water reservoir behind the ornamental head of the stick pin in which a flower blossom could be placed. Patent 1,301,568 dated April 22, 1919 was for a luminous stickpin with a star motif disk-like head which held a small drop of radioactive material.Julie Robinson. Stickpins: Tiny works of art.

(Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5naorXkc5) Gold or silver style safety pins were commonly used as tie and collar pins from the beginning of the 20th century. Such a safety pin was used to fasten the tie to the shirt and was an integral part of a man's clothing or school uniform, being especially useful on formal occasions or in windy weather. It could now be possibly making a comeback in 2013 as recently illustrated in the fashion section of a British newspaper. Alternative ways to control unruly ties are available, although an ordinary safety pin inserted through from behind the shirt can invisibly secure the tie without damaging its surface. During the 1920s the use of straight ties made of delicate materials such as silk became more fashionable and the use of tie clips gained prominence, replacing the more traditional tie pin. ==References== ==External links== *How To Tie A Bow Tie?

Stahley served in the U.S. Navy in San Diego during World War II, and then coached in Washington, D.C. at George Washington University, with a record in 1946 and 1947. He briefly returned to the West Coast in March 1948 as the backfield coach at the University of Washington in Seattle under new head coach Howie Odell. After two months, Stahley left for the Midwest to become the head coach at Toledo, and compiled an 11–10 record in two seasons. Stahley returned to Seattle in 1950 as backfield coach at Washington for three seasons under Odell, where he mentored notable Huskies Hugh McElhenny and Don Heinrich. Odell was pressured to resign by the athletic director after a season in 1952 and was replaced by John Cherberg, the coach of the freshman team. ==NFL== Stahley left the Huskies to coach in the National Football League (NFL) as the backfield coach with the Chicago Cardinals under head coach Joe Stydahar. The Cardinals ended 1953 with a win in the final game to finish at the worst record in the twelve-team league. ==Idaho== Stahley quickly returned to college football in February 1954 as the head coach at Idaho at an annual salary of $9,000. The Vandals had finished the 1953 season at under third-year head coach Babe Curfman. Stahley compiled a record in eight seasons in Moscow. While on the Palouse, he coached future NFL notables Jerry Kramer, Wayne Walker, Jim Prestel, and AFL all-star Jim Norton. The Vandals were members of the Pacific Coast Conference for Stahley's first five seasons, then played as an independent when the conference disbanded. Idaho's only conference victory under Stahley came in his first season: the winless Vandals (0–5) surprised and shut out neighbor Washington State in Pullman in the Battle of the Palouse in 1954. It was Idaho's first victory in football over the Cougars in 29 years, and the subsequent march by WSC students from Pullman to Moscow was featured in Life magazine: The win started a four-game winning streak, Idaho's longest in 31 years, to finish at for the 1954 season. That win at Rogers Field in his first attempt turned out to be Stahley's only triumph over the Cougars; the Vandals waited a full decade before the next. When Idaho athletic director Bob Gibb left in 1960, Stahley took over those duties in July for four years. He handled both jobs for a year and a half, then stepped down under pressure as football coach in January 1962. The following month, he hired Dee Andros, an assistant coach at Illinois and a former guard under Bud Wilkinson As AD, Stahley was a driving force in the creation of the Big Sky Conference, which was formed in February 1963. After a decade in Moscow, Stahley resigned as Idaho's athletic director in 1964 to become the first full-time director of athletics at where he served until Following the 1964 football season, Andros left after three years for Oregon State in Corvallis to succeed who left the Rose Bowl team for UCLA. Stahley's eight consecutive seasons as head coach of Idaho football remains the most in program history; as a result, he led the Vandals in losses with 51 until October 2019, when passed by seventh-year head coach Paul Petrino. ===U.S. patent=== Prior to his last season as head coach, Stahley was granted a for an early defensive reaction machine, issued on Training Apparatus\\" was conceived to improve the reactions of defensive linemen at the line of scrimmage. ==Halls of fame== Stahley is a member of the Idaho Sports Hall of Fame, the Western Pennsylvania Hall of Fame, and the National Association of Collegiate athletic directors Hall of Fame. ==Personal== Stahley married Mrs. Shirley Sherman Kime (c.1910–1993) in Toledo on July 1, 1950. They had two daughters, and she had two sons from a previous marriage. Following retirement from PSU in 1972, Stahley and his wife continued to reside in Portland for the next two decades; he died in 1992 at the age of 83, and she died the following year. ===Crime fighter=== While an assistant coach in 1938, The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that Stahley knocked out a suspected burglar with a single punch. In the early hours of a winter morning in Somerville, Massachusetts, the perpetrator was halfway through a second floor apartment window when he was discovered by its female occupant, and she let out an audible warning. Stahley also lived in the building, and he and a couple of companions were outside at the base of the fire escape to encounter him. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Go Mighty Vandals – 1954 – Dawn of the Stahley Era * Category:1908 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Basketball players from Pennsylvania Category:Brown Bears football coaches Category:Chicago Cardinals coaches Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football coaches Category:George Washington Colonials football coaches Category:Harvard Crimson football coaches Category:Idaho Vandals athletic directors Category:Idaho Vandals football coaches Category:McDaniel Green Terror football coaches Category:Penn State Nittany Lions basketball players Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football players Category:Penn State Nittany Lions men's lacrosse players Category:People from Lebanon, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:Portland State Vikings athletic directors Category:Toledo Rockets football coaches Category:Washington Huskies football coaches Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Skip Stahley"},{"id":"7775544","text":"Willie Lee May (November 11, 1936 - March 28, 2012) was an American hurdler.May, 1960 Olympic 110m Hurdles silver medallist, dies aged 75.

His legend, according to the 14th century source known as the De laudibus Papiæ (In the Praise of Pavia), states that Syrus was the boy with the five loaves who appears in the Gospels. As Hippolyte Delehaye writes, \\"To have lived amongst the Saviour's immediate following was...honorable...and accordingly old patrons of churches were identified with certain persons in the gospels or who were supposed to have had some part of Christ's life on earth.\\" Syrus is said to have followed Saint Peter to Rome and from there he was sent to the Po valley to preach and convert the people to the Christian faith. He preached in all of the major cities of northern Italy. Another tradition, dating back to the 8th century, makes Syrus a disciple of Saint Hermagoras, who in turn was the disciple of Mark the Evangelist. Hermagoras was the founder of the diocese of Aquileia. Together with Juventius of Pavia he was sent there by Saint Hermagoras. Both Juventius and Syrus are reported to have been the first bishop of Pavia. Syrus worked to challenge and convert those who followed Arianism in his diocese. ==Veneration== Syrus is the patron saint of Pavia.

The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture. The concept overlaps with, or is a subset of, monumental sculpture. It has also been defined as \\"an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure.\\" Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia. ==Egyptian== Luxor Obelisk Modern understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on the religious monuments that have survived since antiquity, which are carved stone with post and lintel construction. These religious monuments dedicated to the gods or pharaohs were designed with a great deal of architectural sculpture inside and out: engaged statues, carved columns and pillars, and wall surfaces carved with bas- reliefs. The classic examples of Egyptian colossal monuments (the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Abu Simbel temples, the Karnak Temple Complex, etc.) represent thoroughly integrated combinations of architecture and sculpture. Obelisks, elaborately carved from a single block of stone, were usually placed in pairs to flank the entrances to temples and pyramids. Reliefs are also common in Egyptian building, depicting scenes of everyday life and often accompanied by hieroglyphics. ==Assyro-Babylonian== The Fertile Crescent architectural sculptural tradition began when Ashurnasirpal II moved his capitol to the city of Nimrud around 879 BCE. This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum (alabaster). This fairly easy to cut stone could be quarried in large blocks that allowed them to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there. The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief.Reade, Julian (1983) Assyrian Sculpture Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press pp. 17-21 Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries. ==Indian== ==Greco-Roman== The Caryatid Porch of the Erechtheion, Athens, 421-407 BC Classical Greek architecture, like the prototypical Parthenon, incorporate architectural sculpture in a fairly narrow set of standard, formal building elements. The names of these elements still comprise the usual vocabulary for discussion: the pediment, metope, frieze, caryatid, quadriga, acroteria, etc. Greek examples of architectural sculpture are distinguished not only by their age but their very high quality and skilful technique, with rhythmic and dynamic modelling, figural compositions in friezes that continue seamlessly over vertical joints from one block of stone to the next, and mastery of depth and legibility. The known Greek and Roman examples have been exhaustively studied, and frequently copied or adapted into subsequent neoclassical styles: Greek Revival architecture (usually the most strict), Neoclassical architecture, Beaux-Arts architecture with its exaggerated and romantic free interpretations of the vocabulary, and even Stalinist architecture like the Central Moscow Hippodrome adapted to a totalitarian aesthetic. These re-interpretations are sometimes dubious; for instance, there are many modern copies of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, like the National Diet Building in Tokyo, despite the fact that all classical descriptions of the Mausoleum are vague. ==European== ==Pre-Columbian North and South America== ==Post-contact North and South America== === United States === Pediment sculpture detail, Philadelphia Museum of Art, sculptor C. Paul Jennewein, 1933 Not until about 1870 did the U.S. develop the talent, the economic power, and the taste for buildings grand enough to need architectural sculpture. The Philadelphia City Hall, constructed 1871 through 1901, is recognized as the turning point,Gurney, George (1974) Sculpture of a City—Philadelphia's Treasures in Bronze and Stone, Fairmount Park Association, New York: Walker Publishing Co., Inc. because of the approximately 250 sculptures planned for the building, the large finial of William Penn, and the practical effect of Alexander Milne Calder training many assistants there. In the same years, H.H. Richardson began to develop his influential signature genre, which included romantic, medieval, and Romanesque stone carving. Richard Morris Hunt became the first to bring the Parisian neo-classical École des Beaux-Arts style back to the United States, a style that depended on integrated figural sculpture and a highly ornamented building fabric for its aesthetic effect. The Beaux-Arts style dominated for major public buildings between the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, through about 1912, the year of the San Francisco City Hall. The need for sculptors saw the emergence of a small industry of carvers and modelers, and a professional organization, the National Sculpture Society. The advent of steel frames and reinforced concrete encouraged, at first, more diverse building styles into the 1910s and 1920s. The diversity of skyscraper Gothic, exotic \\"revivals\\" of Mayan and Egyptian, Stripped Classicism, Art Deco, etc. called for a similar diversity of sculptural approaches. The use of sculpture was still expected, particularly for public buildings such as war memorials and museums. In 1926 the pre-eminent American architectural sculptor, Lee Lawrie, with his longtime friend and collaborator architect Bertram Goodhue, developed perhaps the most sophisticated American examples at the Nebraska State Capitol and the Los Angeles Public Library. Goodhue's premature death ended that collaboration. The Depression, and the onset of World War II, decimated building activity. The old building trades disbanded. By the postwar years the aesthetic of architectural modernism had taken hold. Except for a few diehards and regional sculptors, the profession was not only dead but discredited. As of the 2010s there are isolated signs of a revival of interest, for instance in the career of Raymond Kaskey and the Persist statue in Sacramento, California. ==See also== * List of architectural sculpture in Westminster ==References== ==External links== * Category:Sculpture Category:Garden features Sculpture Category:History of sculpture Category:Landscape design history Category:Ornaments (architecture) ","title":"Architectural sculpture"},{"id":"7775607","text":"Glossa ( meaning \\"tongue\\") is a village and a community in the northwestern part of the island of Skopelos in the Northern Sporades.

Edwards and Hervas met in 1990 working in the R&D; of Thomson Digital Images, a Paris company and maker of Explore, a 3D software. In 1993, they were among the early employees at Sony Pictures Imageworks in Los Angeles, and later worked at early Weta in New Zealand on the film \\"The Frighteners\\" for Peter Jackson. Their experiences from both the software development and user sides led them to begin development of Shake as a high-speed, high-quality tool specifically designed for the feature film visual effects industry. Emmanuel Mogenet joined the R&D; as a senior developer in the summer of 1997 as Shake 2.0 was being rewritten with a full user interface. In the fall of 1997, Dan Candela (R&D;), Louis Cetorelli (head of support) and Peter Warner (designer/expert user) were added to the team. After initially working as a consultant in early 1998, Ron Brinkmann also joined that spring as product manager. This core group were all among the original Sony Imageworks employees. Shake 2.0 was first shown at the 1998 NAB conference as an alpha demo with a minimal set of nodes, a node view and the player. A more complete beta version of Shake 2.0 was shown at the 1998 SIGGRAPH conference. Version 2 was released in early 1999 for Windows NT and IRIX, costing $9900 US per license, or $3900 for a render-only license. Over the next few years, Shake rapidly became the standard compositing software in the visual effects industry for feature films. In 2000, Shake version 2.1 cost US$9,900 plus an annual maintenance fee of approximately US$1,500. The additional render-only license cost US$3,900. The software was available for Linux, Irix and Windows NT. Apple Computer's purchase of Nothing Real in 2002 changed the way in which Shake was marketed and sold. Apple released Shake for Mac OS X and lowered the price to US$4,950 with an annual maintenance fee of US$1,199. Apple continued to lower Shake's price over the years.

Although he favoured cross country running, he was also a skilled marathon runner and, despite running shoe technology being in its infancy, he was able to adapt easily to the change of conditions underfoot. Heatley was a three-time winner of the English National Cross Country title (1960, 1961, 1963). He competed in the International Cross Country Championships seven times between 1957 and 1964, winning the world title in 1961. In the early 1960s, he set a British record and a world record for the 10-mile run, then on 13 June 1964 he broke the record for the world's fastest marathon. Four months later, he won a silver medal for Great Britain at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics when he finished second in the Olympic marathon (defending champion Abebe Bikila broke Heatley's world record on winning his second gold medal). The 1964 Olympics marked the end of Heatley's international career. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Heatley grew up on a farm near Coventry in the English West Midlands. He developed an interest in running in his early teens. He started reading athletics magazines and bought a copy of \\"Athletics and Training\\", a book written by British Olympic athlete Guy Butler. As a 14-year-old boy, he read about the 1948 Summer Olympics that were taking place in London, and was inspired by Czechoslovakian long-distance runner Emil Zátopek whose performance made a lasting impression on him. He attended grammar school, where he discovered his natural ability for cross country running and soon started to take the sport seriously. He trained on the driveway of the family farm and got extra conditioning from his early years of farm work and cycling eight miles to school and back every day. Heatley's National Service was deferred because he was working in the farming industry (an \\"essential service\\" that allowed a period of exemption), but he eventually signed up in October 1954 at the age of twenty. He served in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, working with horses and dogs, and came out of the army as a corporal. His training and fitness declined while he was in the military and it had a detrimental effect on his running. ===Cross country running career=== Heatley joined Coventry Godiva Harriers at the end of 1950 and was to become a life member of the club. He won the Midland Cross Country Youth title in 1951, and finished third in the English National Youth Cross Country Championship. He won another bronze medal in the National Juniors cross country race in 1952. During the 1953/54 season, he took part in cross country races at the Junior level in the Birmingham League, winning their first division race at least eight times. He then won the Midland Cross Country Junior title in both 1954 and 1955, and the Midland Cross Country Senior title five times (1957–1960 and 1964). He first started marathon running in 1956 and won the Midlands Championships the same year, completing the distance in 2:36:55. He successfully defended his title at the 1957 Midlands Championships, improving on his previous time with 2:23:01. He then decided to take a break from marathon running, preferring to concentrate on his cross country career, and he would not revisit the marathon until a number of years later. Heatley was one of the top scorers for the England Cross Country team between 1957 and 1964, competing every year at the English National Cross Country Championships. After finishing 5th in his first attempt at the Seniors level in 1957 at Peterborough, he eventually won the national title for the first time in 1960 at West Bromwich. He successfully defended his title the following year at Parliament Hill Fields, and completed his national hat-trick in 1963 with his third win at Cambridge. He finished in the top ten at the National Cross on six other occasions, only once finishing in the low teens (at Blackpool in 1962) due to an injury that had been affecting his form over that particular season. He also represented Warwickshire at the Inter Counties Cross Country Championships during this period, winning the title in 1959 and taking second place in 1960. He was a seven-time participant in the International Cross Country Championships (forerunner of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships). At his first attempt in the 1957 International Cross in Belgium, he came runner-up in the 9-mile run to teammate Frank Sando. He finished 9th in 1958, and took 4th place in both 1959 and 1960. Heatley finally became cross country world champion at the 1961 International Cross in Nantes, France, winning with an impressive margin of 23 seconds. On 15 April 1961, in the AAA Championships at Hurlingham Park in London, he broke his hero Zátopek's world record for the 10-mile run, with a time of 47 minutes and 47 seconds. A versatile runner over various distances, he was also a regular performer in the 6-mile run and the 10,000 metres. ===Marathon world record=== In 1962, having taken an extended break from marathon running, Heatley came to the conclusion that his best hope of winning an Olympic medal before his retirement was to focus his efforts on the marathon event at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. He confessed that he was not keen on the marathon, saying it was \\"just a bit too far\\" for him; he preferred the shorter distances, particularly the 10-mile run. His first outing was at the 1963 AAA marathon in Coventry, which he used as a dummy run to test his potential, but he finished the race in second place to clubmate Brian Kilby with a time of 2:19:56. In October of the same year, encouraged by his success in the AAA, he took part in the Košice Peace Marathon in Slovakia, and took fourth place with 2:20:22. When training for the marathon, he ran up to 125 miles per week self-coached, and set his all-time personal bests of 13:22.8 for 3 miles (ranking him second in Britain over the distance) and 27:57.0 for 6 miles. Determined to make the Olympic marathon team, he put himself in for the Polytechnic Marathon between Windsor and Chiswick on 13 June 1964, where he set a new world record; his time of 2:13:55 broke Buddy Edelen's world best from the previous year's race by 33 seconds. This outstanding performance guaranteed Heatley's selection for the Tokyo Olympics. ===Olympic silver medal=== Heatley's most memorable appearance came on 21 October 1964 when he won a silver medal for Great Britain at the Tokyo Olympics. The gold medal went to defending champion, Ethiopia's Abebe Bikila, who in turn broke the world record with a time of 2:12:11.2, replacing Heatley in the record books. Heatley was in 12th position half way through the marathon but, despite suffering from stitch for a large part of the race, he managed to work his way up the field to move into third position behind Japan's Kōkichi Tsuburaya. He was 75 seconds behind Tsuburaya at the 40km mark and the two runners were separated by 30 metres as they approached the Olympic stadium. Four minutes after Bikila had won the race, Tsuburaya entered the stadium in second place in front of a cheering home crowd, but he was running out of strength. Heatley sprinted the last 200 metres of the stadium lap in 32.3 seconds, overtaking Tsuburaya just 110 metres before the finish line to take second place. He had completed the marathon in 2 hours, 16 minutes and 19.2 seconds, winning the Olympic silver medal. Tsuburaya finished third in 2:16:22.8, followed by Heatley's teammate Brian Kilby in fourth place. Heatley was the fourth Briton to win silver in the Olympic marathon (after Sam Ferris in 1932, Ernie Harper in 1936 and Tom Richards in 1948), and although Charlie Spedding took the bronze medal in Los Angeles twenty years later, no Briton has won a silver medal in the Olympic marathon since Heatley's achievement in 1964. ===Retirement and later life=== Heatley retired from international competition after the 1964 Games and then became a British athletics team manager. He was secretary of the Midland Cross Country Association for a number of years during the 1970s. He continued to compete in the Third Division of the Birmingham League for several years after his international retirement and remained closely involved with the sport into later life. In 2014, Heatley and his wife Gill visited Tokyo on the 50th anniversary of the 1964 Games and met with relatives of both Tsuburaya and Bikila. In 2015, at the age of 82, Heatley was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame at the Hilton Metropole in Birmingham. He was presented with his award by former long-distance world record holder David Moorcroft. ==Personal bests== Heatley achieved the following personal bests during his running career: *3 miles: 13:22.8 *5,000 metres: 13:57.2 *6 miles: 27:57.0 *10,000 metres: 28:55.8 *10 miles: 47:47.0 (WR) *Marathon (26.22 miles): 2:13:55 (WR) ==References== == External links == * Category:1933 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Kenilworth Category:English male long-distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:International Cross Country Championships winners Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:People educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) ","title":"Basil Heatley"},{"id":"7775728","text":"Milan Radenkovich Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical compositions, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969, pp.88, 233, 309.

Greg Shaw placed Milan's song \\"I'm a Leather Boy\\" as the opening track on two different albums in the Pebbles series: the Pebbles, Volume 10 CD and the earlier Pebbles, Volume 11 LP (which was also the first album to be released on his AIP record label). He has written of Milan as being \\"a cryptic artist who made a series of high image records offering himself as some leather-clad, bike- riding rebel, but so stylized he might've been imagined by Andy Warhol. . . . The only name to be found on these records is Milan, a name that also shows up as writer/producer on a big pile of records, from the early 60s right thru the end of the decade. . . . But who was he? No further clue has ever emerged. This is one guy whose story really cries out to be told.\\"Liner notes, Pebbles, Volume 10 CD. In the promotional material for the 2009 retrospective album Hell Bent for Leather, Milan was described in this way: \\"From his earliest incarnation in the record industry as a Xmas twister, the enigmatic Milan has changed his name and re-invented himself several times: a teen idol with a cute hairdo and a preppy look, a garage gonzo savage, an all dressed-in-black biker stud, a psychedelic screamer in love with satellite sounds, and other characters known or waiting to be discovered. One thing is for sure: Few people can claim so many identities in less than a decade.\\" ==Identity and background== Milan was born Milan Radenković, anglicized as Milan Radenkovich,On-line article on The 1960s New York Garage Band Scene, by Mike Markesich. Retrieved 15 Oct 2006. though the surname is rarely if ever shown on records attributed to him. However, he changed his name to Richard (Rick) Rodell while he was still in high school in Florida, and was often known by that name in the recording industry. Milan's father performed as Rasha (or Rascha) Rodell, and was a folk singer and guitarist who performed in the late 1950s at the Eden Roc Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida.Myspace entry on Harry Volpe. Retrieved 10 October 2009. Milan's older brother, Petar Radenković, is a former Yugoslavian-Serbian goalkeeper with the football (soccer) team, TSV 1860 München of Munich, who won the German Bundesliga title in 1966 and the German Cup in 1964. ==Album, I Am What I Am== Album Cover After a couple of early singles, Milan released an LP on 20th Century Fox in 1964, named I Am What I Am, along with two associated singles, \\"I Am What I Am\\" b/w \\"Over and Over Again\\" and later \\"Runnin' Wild\\" b/w \\"Angel's Lullaby\\". The front cover (pictured) also includes \\"presenting a bright new star\\". The album's liner notes describe Milan as \\"a darkly handsome, six foot, 160 lb. twenty year old\\" with a \\"European musical background\\" and continue: \\"Milan is popular music . . . he lives it, loves it and understands it and refuses to allow the tendency to copy whatever happens to be in the top ten at the present time to influence his work\\" (ellipses in the original). The album is in the style of early 1960s orchestral pop music records, instead of the garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings for which he is better known. However, some of the songs on the album, including \\"Runnin' Wild\\" and \\"Spellbound\\" have the flavor of his later garage-rock classics. ==Later recording career== thumb As far as his persona is concerned, the moniker \\"Leather Boy\\" is certainly appropriate, since he is shown in several photographs in a leather jacket. Anticipating his pose on the single \\"I'm a Leather Boy\\", he is shown on the back cover of his earlier album holding a guitar and dressed in what appears to be a faux leather smock emblazoned with \\"Milan\\" in stylized lettering. (This lettering was later incorporated into the design of the cover of the 2009 Hell Bent for Leather album). ==Producer, arranger and songwriting credits== For the most part, the name \\"Milan\\" was used in his many appearances on disc as songwriter, arranger or producer; but there are many exceptions. On his first single, the songwriter of \\"Santa's Doin' the Twist\\" and \\"Swing a Little Harder\\" is given as \\"Rick Rodell\\". On his 1964 album, the songwriter is listed as \\"M. Rodell\\", and on the first of the two associated singles, the songwriter is \\"Milan Rodelle\\" (with the surname misspelled in that case). \\"M. Rodell\\" is also listed as the songwriter and arranger on the Licorice Schtik song \\"The Kissin' Game\\". He also was the producer for both sides of a 1967 single \\"Bongo Bongo\\" b/w \\"Free as a Bird\\" on MGM – MGM also released some of his own singles – for an obscure girl group called The Chanters. He was also listed as the songwriter of \\"Bongo Bongo\\". According to the programmer of the compilation albums Look What I Found, Volume 12 and Look What I Found, Volume 21 – which each included a re-release of one side of this single – \\"'Bongo Bongo' sounds like [Milan's] 'On the Go'. . . The Chanters have remained a mystery band as I've never seen this 45 on any compilation.\\" A song by the Downtown Collection called \\"Washington Square\\" was included on Volume 42 of the same series; Milan was the producer on this record. In a foray into yet another style of music, Milan wrote and arranged both sides of a single on Capitol for a bubblegum pop band called Ice Cream that was released in 1968. ==Reissues and other sources== thumb In 1983, Milan was re-introduced to the world in Pebbles, Volume 11 of the LPs in the Pebbles series. This was actually the first album in the series to be officially released by Bomp! and was the initial LP on their AIP label. This particular compilation album starts off with both sides of a 1967 single by The Leather Boy, \\"I'm a Leather Boy\\" and \\"Shadows\\", while \\"You Gotta Have Soul\\" closes the album. The former cut is an exuberant garage rock track that features actual sounds of motorcycles in the background that even Steppenwolf eschewed, while the latter is a passionate romp that has a similar gritty feel. \\"Shadows\\" – a thoughtful meditation on the remains of a failed romance – is a marvelous psychedelic rock masterwork that appears on the Pebbles box sets called Pebbles Box and Trash Box but is not otherwise available in the Pebbles series on CD. However, \\"On the Go\\" appears on the Pebbles, Volume 10 CD (this song also reprises the motorcycle sounds from \\"I'm a Leather Boy\\"). Greg Shaw expressed hope that an album could be collected of his work some dayLiner notes, Pebbles, Volume 11 LP. — which finally occurred in 2009 when Hell Bent for Leather was released — adding that \\"what he did with Donovan songs has to be heard to be believed!\\". The latter is a reference to the Leather Boy cover of Donovan's song \\"Jersey Thursday\\" on one of the rarest of Milan's singles. However, in addition to those in the Pebbles series, Milan's recordings have been collected on several other garage-rock and psychedelic-rock collections. While not reaching the stratospheric level of artists like the Human Expression and the Outcasts (from Texas), the original Milan 45s sell on a regular basis for elevated prices. For instance, between 2004 and 2006, the \\"I'm a Leather Boy\\" single sold at auction on eBay for $68, £15 and £27. ==Death== Milan died on March 14, 1971, aged 29, in New York, possibly from brain cancer. ==Discography== ===Singles=== ====As a recording artist==== As Milan with His Orchestra: * \\"Santa's Doin' the Twist\\" b/w \\"Swing a Little Longer\\"; Migon (#1962-A/B) – 1962 As Milan: * \\"Innocence\\" b/w \\"Winter Time\\"; End (#1123) – 1963 * \\"I Am What I Am\\" b/w \\"Over and Over Again\\"; 20th Century Fox (#487) – 1964 * \\"Runnin' Wild\\" b/w \\"Angel's Lullaby\\"; 20th Century Fox (#552) – 1964 As The World of Milan: * \\"Cry, Lonely Boy\\" b/w \\"Luva-Luva\\"; ABC-Paramount (#10718) – 1965 * \\"Follow the Sun\\" b/w \\"I'm Cryin' in the Rain\\"; Brunswick (#55292) – 1966 * \\"One Track Mind\\" b/w \\"Shades of Blue\\"; Brunswick (#55298) – 1966 As Milan (The Leather Boy): * \\"You Gotta Have Soul\\" b/w \\"My Prayer\\"; Flower (#100) – 1967 As The Leather Boy: * \\"I'm a Leather Boy\\" b/w \\"Shadows\\"; MGM (#K-13724) – April 1967 * \\"On the Go\\" b/w \\"Soulin'\\"; MGM (#K-13790) – August 1967 * \\"Jersey Thursday\\" b/w \\"Black Friday\\"; Parkway (#125) – 1967 ====As a producer, arranger and/or songwriter==== Lou Christie: * \\"How Many Teardrops\\" b/w \\"You and I (Have a Right to Cry)\\"; Roulette #R-4504 – 1963 The American Beetles: * \\"Don't Be Unkind\\" b/w \\"You Did It To Me\\"; Roulette (#4550) – 1964 The Chanters: * \\"Bongo Bongo\\" b/w \\"Free as a Bird\\"; MGM (#K13750) – 1967 The Unclaimed: * \\"Memories of Green Eyes\\" b/w/ \\"Jingle Jangle\\"; Philips (#30430) – 1967 The Licorice Schtik: * \\"The Kissin' Game\\" b/w \\"Flowers Flowers\\"; Dot (#17131) – 1968 ===Albums=== ====Studio albums==== As a recording artist * I Am What I Am; 20th Century Fox (#TFM 3149/#TFS 4149) — 1964 As a producer, arranger and/or songwriter * The Head Shop; Epic (#BN 26476) – 1969 ====Retrospective album==== * Hell Bent for Leather; LS (#LS-001LP) – 2009 (vinyl only) ====Compilation albums==== I'm a Leather Boy # Pebbles, Volume 11 (LP) # Pebbles, Volume 10 (CD) # Pebbles, Volume 3 (CD – ESD Release) # Mayhem and Psychosis, Volume 1 (LP) # Mayhem and Psychosis, Volume 1 (CD) Shadows # Pebbles, Volume 11 (LP) # Pebbles Box (LP Box Set) # Trash Box (CD Box Set) You Gotta Have Soul # Pebbles, Volume 11 (LP) On the Go # Pebbles, Volume 10 (CD) # A Journey to Tyme, Volume 5 (LP) # Garagelands, Volume 1 (LP) # Garagelands, Volume 1 (CD) # Wavy Gravy series Soulin' # A Journey to Tyme, Volume 5 (LP) # Garagelands, Volume 1 (LP) # Garagelands, Volume 1 (CD) One Track Mind # Winning Sides, Volume 2 (LP) # Quagmires, Volume 3 (CD) ==References== ==External links== * Martin Winfree, \\"Milan\\", Issuu.com Category:1941 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Garage rock musicians Category:American pop singers Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American rock singers Category:American rock songwriters Category:American male songwriters Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American people of Serbian descent Category:Singers from New York (state) Category:Psychedelic rock musicians Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:Guitarists from New York (state) Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Milan the Leather Boy"},{"id":"7775734","text":"Oakhill Christian School is a private, non-denominational Christian school located in Janesville, Wisconsin.

USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617) is a United States Coast Guard medium endurance cutter. She is the twelfth cutter to bear the name Vigilant, dating back to 1790 when the original Vigilant was built for the United States Revenue-Marine. She was commissioned on October 3, 1964, at Todd Shipyards in Houston, Texas, at a cost of 2.3 million dollars. From 1964 through 1989 Vigilant was homeported in New Bedford, Massachusetts. In 1989, she underwent an 18-month Major Maintenance Availability in order to modernize her capabilities. In 1990, Vigilant moved her homeport to Port Canaveral, Florida. Vigilant has just completed another yard period, updating her with the most modern electronic and engineering equipment available. ==Kudirka incident== On November 23, 1970, Simonas \\"Simas\\" Kudirka, a Soviet seaman of Lithuanian origin, leapt from the 400-foot (120 m) mother ship Sovetskaya Litva, anchored in U.S waters near Aquinnah, Massachusetts, on Martha's Vineyard, aboard Vigilant, sailing from New Bedford, Massachusetts. The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe. Ten hours passed. After attempts to get the U.S. State Department to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to return Kudirka to the Soviets. Commander Eustis refused to subject his own crew to the task and instead permitted a detachment of Soviet seamen to board the Vigilant to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship. (The engineering crew had offered to hide Kudirka in the engine air intake shaft which could not be opened while the engines were running but the offer was declined.) This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ. Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive letter of reprimand and assigned to shore duty. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and was allowed to come to the United States in 1974. A book detailing the incident, Day of Shame, by Algis Ruksenas, was published in 1973. The book helped spur further investigations into the incident that eventually led to Kudirka's release by the Soviets. It remains part of the reading curriculum in the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. The incident was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, The Defection of Simas Kudirka, with Alan Arkin playing Kudirka and Donald Pleasence playing the captain of the Soviet ship. In the movie, the USCGC Decisive (WMEC 629) played the part of the Vigilant. ==Notable crew== *Admiral Thomas H.

He won a bronze medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the 3000 meter steeplechase and held several American records in events ranging from the two mile to the 5000 meter race. He broke two world records, in the indoor two and three mile events. ==Early life and education== Born in Roswell, New Mexico, Young graduated from Western High School in Silver City in 1955. He then attended the University of Arizona where he competed in track and field. He began running the 3000 meter steeplechase in his senior year and finished second in that event at the National AAU championship. He graduated from the University in 1959 with an undergraduate degree after being named the \\"outstanding senior athlete\\" of the year. ==1960 Olympics== Shortly after graduating, Young qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. During the preliminary rounds for the steeplechase, he tripped over a hurdle and thus did not advance to the finals. The next year, he broke the American steeplechase record when he ran the event in 8:31.0. ==1964 Olympics== He improved his Olympic record at the 1964 games in Tokyo, running to fifth place in the steeplechase in 8:38.2. Gaston Roelants of Belgium won gold in an Olympic Record 8:30.8. ==1968 Olympics== In the first half of 1968, Young broke his own American steeplechase record with a time of 8:30.6 and set the American two mile record with a time of 8:22.0. He felt his fitness was strong enough that he and training partner Billy Mills thought they'd take a shot an Olympic marathon qualifier at the trials held in Alamosa, CO. Young won the race and earned his way on to his third Olympic team. He later qualified again in the steeplechase at the track and field trials held in Echo Summit, California. At the 1968 Olympics, held in Mexico City at an elevation of 7,382 ft, he competed in the marathon, placing 16th, and the steeplechase, where he placed third and took the bronze medal. In that race, he was leading with about 300 Meters to go before falling victim to Mexico City's altitude and \\"hitting the wall\\". He was passed by two athletes born and trained at altitude in Kenya. The following year Young set two world records in the indoor two and three mile events with times of 8:27.2 and 13:09.8, respectively. He was featured on the March 1969 cover of Track and Field News. ==1972 Olympics== After a classic battle with University of Oregon All-American, Steve Prefontaine at the 1972 U.S. Olympic Trials at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, he competed in the 5000 meter race at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich (his third different Olympic event in four Olympic Games), but did not advance to the final rounds. ==Career summary and records== In addition to his records in the steeplechase, two mile and indoor three mile, he also held American records for the 5000 meter, 3000 meter, steeplechase, and 4x1500 meter relay, as well as twelve age group world records. At age 34, he became the oldest person in the world (at that time) to run a sub-four-minute mile, with a time of 3:59.6 in Los Angeles, CA in March 1972. He was the first New Mexico born athlete to accomplish this feat. ==Post-running career== Following his running career, he coached seven different sports at Central Arizona College. He led his teams to a total of fourteen championships, including the 1988 national title in cross country. In 1988 he was named the National Junior College Athletic Association coach of the year. ==Legacy and honors== He was inducted into the National Track & Field Hall of Fame in 1981 and the National Distance Running Hall of Fame in 2003.

He is also known as Phantom, Noski, Katana, and DJ Randy. He is a prominent producer, and a pioneer of the Tribal-Tech-Trance genre, hitting hard on the trance club scene with a track called Play it Loud. It was followed up with many remixes, including the appropriately named Play it Louder. His previous tracks, One solid wave\\" and \\"In Silence, were also huge successes, being played by DJs such as Paul van Dyk, Armin van Buuren, Tiësto, and were also featuring on many CD compilations. ==Biography== Randy Katana originally came from the Dutch Antillean Islands (Aruba, Curaçao and St Martin), where for many years he worked as resident DJ at many of the trendiest clubs on the Islands. He also spend many years playing drums in Brass Bands, which on the islands where specialized in Carnival music. This is where Randy acquired the Latin tribal soul that he projects in his music today. 1992 - 2003 Randy Katana has been pioneering the Dutch dance sounds for well over two decades now. He founded the legendary Jinx and BPM Dance label collective (2 Play, Silver Premium, Tri Lamb, Smoke Free DJ Tools, Bango) that spearheaded the development of trance music as we know it today, finding & developing production talent such as Signum, Mac Zimms (Starkillers) and Mark Norman along the way. 2003 - 2007 Randy is no stranger to the studio himself, and is one of the most influential and forward thinking Tech Trance producers of our generation. Producing under the name Katana at first, then DJ Randy, and more recently Randy Katana, there are few producers who can claim to have been in vogue and in demand in what is a rapidly changing scene. It wasn't until the summer of 2003, when Randy's involvement in label management reached a crossroads that made him decide to become a full-time DJ. After a tryout at one of the biggest clubs in Amsterdam he was immediately accepted as resident DJ at XL (Kingdom), and his DJing progress since has been nothing short of phenomenal. Randy Katana became one of the fastest growing artists in the Netherlands over the next year, the most booked international DJ in Spain, and played countries like Poland, Malta, Crete, Sweden, Norway, France, UK, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Romania, Switzerland, Italy, Turkey, Morocco, Colombia, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, South-Africa and Australia. In Madrid he headlined the Fabrik White Party together with Judge Jules for a capacity crowd of 7000, while in the Netherlands he performed at some of the biggest festivals, including Dance Valley (Summer and Winter editions), Trance Energy, Beachpop, Almere Free Festival and loads more, Randy's rise through the DJ ranks was in overdrive and fuelled by some of his biggest productions to date. Hot on the heels of his massive releases 'Fancy Fair', 'Alesis' and 'Dulce Vita', that were hammered by every A-list trance DJ on the planet, Randy followed up with the awesome 'In Silence', awarded 'Best Track Of The Year' in the 2004 www.tranceaddict.com poll, and in 2005 came 'Pleasure Island', remixes of 'Fancy Fair' and one of the biggest dance anthems of the year in 'Play It Loud'. Moving into 2006 and Randy's DJ diary features virtually every major events in Europe, including Planet Love, Goodgreef, Ministry of Sound, Gatecrasher, The Gallery, The Vaults, Inside Out and Slinky in the UK, plus massive one-off events in eastern Europe, South Africa, Scandinavia, Ibiza, Australia and beyond. 2007 - 2011 After releasing his album 'Spirit of the Drums' late 2007 and focusing on re-inventing his typical KATANA-sound in 2008/ 2009, he charges effortlessly to number one in the charts again, with the massive tracks You & I, The Hype & Derb, and became the 5th DJ in the world in 2010 ever to play in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (the coldest city on earth). Always adapting his unique and successful sound to a new style, he starts his own label “Katana Beatz” in 2011. The style of music, that will be released on this label, will range from Tech Trance to Tech House, and mostly Progressive House. Crowds all over the world flock to experience his pioneering, surprising, captivating and energetic uplifting sets, that keeps them craving for more, and provides him the true & well-earned worldwide recognition.

Some operators of the longest of Optare's minibus-derived Solo models commented that the 7.0m wheelbase was too long, reducing manoeuvrability, which resulted from the Solo's front axle being ahead of the passenger entrance. It was officially launched at the Euro Bus Expo 2006 at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham in November 2006, with the first order of 25 buses being placed by Stagecoach.Stylish new bus from Optare Bus & Coach Professional 1 November 2006Stagecoach places £9m order for 100 new buses Stagecoach Group 7 November 2006Stagecoach orders 100 from Optare Bus & Coach Professional 15 November 2006 The Versa, with its entrance ahead of the front axle, considerably reduces the wheelbase, to either 5.13m or 5.82m (depending upon whether the overall length is 10.3m or 11m respectively). It is designed to seat between 36 and 40 passengers. The Versa has a typical Optare design, with a swooping roof line, large glazed area and swept-back front which takes many of its styling cues from the Solo, but with a more modern, updated appearance. ==Hybrid electric version== In 2010, a hybrid electric version was introduced with the first 68 ordered by Transport for Greater Manchester, 20 of them were introduced on the FirstBus operated Metroshuttle routes in November 2010, while others were operated by Maytree Travel.Freedom of the city with Manchester Metroshuttle 2 November 2010Manchester 9 million hybrid school fleet Bus & Coach Professional 26 April 2012 ==Electric version== In 2012, an electric version was introduced with Travel DeCourcey ordering three in 2010, entering service on the Coventry Park & Ride.

On November 19, 2006, Burger King started selling it with any value meal. It is one of three titles released by Burger King. ==Overview== Big Bumpin' is based on bumper cars, featuring characters familiar to Burger King, like the Subservient Chicken, Brooke Burke, and the Burger King himself. Obstacles in the arenas (\\"theme parks\\") include pits and saws. Players can gain power-ups which allow them to deal specific damages. The arenas include the Ice Box, Broiler, King's Court, The Deep, and Monsoon of Doom. The game supports up to four players, as well as up to eight using Xbox Live. PocketBike Racer, Sneak King, and Big Bumpin' were all created in just seven months and were considered to be of such high quality that they were pulled from Xbox Live Arcade to be sold as a 'box product' directly in Burger King stores (they are currently only available in America and Canada). == Development == The origin of three Burger King-themed Xbox Games came about in Cannes when senior executives from Microsoft and Burger King met at the awards for the I Love Bees and Subservient Chicken advertising campaigns. Microsoft wanted the Xbox games to be fun for the players and that the environment would be a Burger King-themed context not be reduced to simply pushing its brand. In the fall of 2005, Blitz Games entered into talks with Burger King and the development team began work in February 2006. In an interview with Gamasutra, Philip Oliver stated that he was talking with Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade portfolio manager, Ross Erickson and had an interest in developing Xbox Live games, but lacked funding as an independent developer. During Oliver and Erickson's talks, Erickson agree to notify Oliver of any leads on advertisers looking for product placement in video games. A week or two after that, Oliver received a call from Erickson about Burger King's interest in creating three games. Gamasutra's interviewer, Brandon Sheffield, noted the odd choice of an American company using a British developer, but Oliver explained that Burger King was familiar with their first Xbox release Fuzion Frenzy. The development began as Xbox Live games, but Burger King wanted the games to also be playable on the Xbox, but the console platform was not able to access Xbox Live Arcade. Burger King decided that having them as boxed games which would require the customer to come into the store to obtain the game. When advised of the difficulty in the production, Burger King explained that it would be able to get approval from Microsoft and that both the Xbox and Xbox360 versions of the game should be available on the same disc. Blitz Games assigned two project managers for the games, Chris Swan and John Jarvis, who held daily conference calls with Burger King and Microsoft's Xbox division throughout the project. Blitz Games worked on increasing communication between the companies by showing the development process for a previous game, from \\"first the black and white sketches, then the color concepts, environment blockouts, texturing and lighting, and finally the results on screen.\\" By laying out a previous workflow process, Blitz Games helped to bridged the advertising presentation gap Burger King's marketers; a failure of which could have \\"crippled the project.\\" Burger King and Blitz Games held daily conference calls to review the designs and Burger King was most concerned with the positive portrayal of the characters. Blitz Games had staff of fifteen people working on the original Xbox360 games grew to nearly sixty persons after Burger King increased the contract and budget for the games. In total, 80 developers were involved in the project. The task of producing two different versions were made easier by Blitz Games' production toolchain that had built-in compatibility for Xbox and the developers able to adjust the game with appropriate hardware coding that had already been previously developed by the company. During the end of each month of the development, the builds of the games were provided to Microsoft as required of all developers. Both masters of the games are included on the discs, Oliver guesses that the Xbox and Xbox360 were able to launch the specific executable based on file name because each disc contains two separate masters and two separate sets of assets. Oliver judged that the Xbox 360's graphics were twice as good as the Xbox, but was far from utilizing the full performance of the Xbox360 hardware. Tasked with creating three games, Blitz Games managed to get an extra month to develop the game due to the challenges involved in the production and a second month after Microsoft agreed to \\"fast track\\" the games through the Quality Assurance process. Oliver summed it up by stating \\"But we still had to effectively do three original games, two (Stock keeping units) of each, in seven months. Scary, but we did it! They're all mastered, they're all in production, and there’s going to be two million units of each disc.\\" ==Release== Big Bumpin was one of three promotional Burger King-themed releases for winter 2006, the other two games were Sneak King and Pocketbike Racer. The Burger King-only marketing run was from November 19 through December 24, 2006. The games were available for $3.99 with any purchase of any Burger King value meal. Destructoid later noted that the cost of the games were later reduced to $0.99 in February 2007. In January 2007, the marketing firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky stated that more than 2.7 million games were sold in the promotion. It was reported that more than 3.2 million copies were sold, Big Bumpin sales by itself were not given, in Game Developers April 2007 issue. ==Reception and impact== Big Bumpin' was the most well received of the three games. It currently holds a 7/10 based on 14 reviews on GameSpot. The immediate impact of the project on Blitz Games was the financial boost it provided, it allowed the company to improve its technology and it also partially funded Blitz Games' Blitz Arcade. Collectively, the games were enough to be ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Story wrote, \\"Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30-second commercials[.]\\" The success of the project, including Big Bumpin was noted as a key part of Burger King's 40% increase in sales during the quarter and it was affirmed by Russell Klein that Burger King attributed the majority of that success to the project. ==References== *Big Bumpin' on IGN, IGN.com, retrieved November 4, 2006 *Burger King and Xbox Team Up, IGN.com, retrieved November 4, 2006 *First look at the trio of Burger King games, SiliconEra, retrieved November 4, 2006 *Big Bumpin' GameSpy profile, GameSpy.com, retrieved November 4, 2006 Category:Burger King advertising Category:2006 video games Category:Advergames Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Burger King Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:North America- exclusive video games Category:Racing video games Category:Action video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Big Bumpin'"},{"id":"7775857","text":"The Sutong Yangtze River Bridge (; , ) is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Yangtze River in China between Nantong and Changshu, a satellite city of Suzhou, in Jiangsu province. ==Design and construction== With a span of , it was the cable-stayed bridge with the longest main span in the world in 2008-2012.

S. Bach holding his Riddle Canon, BWV 1076 (1746) Elias Gottlob Haussmann (also Haußmann or Hausmann) (1695 - 11 April 1774) was a German painter in the late Baroque era. Haussmann served as court painter at Dresden, and from 1720 as the official portraitist at Leipzig. He is mostly known for his portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach which was painted in 1746. Gottfried Reiche Oil painting by Haussmann, 1726-7 Luise Gottsched Oil painting by Haussmann c. 1750 ==Life== Haussmann was born in Gera. He was at first a pupil of his father, Elias Haußmann (1663–1733), who was the Landgrave of Hesse's court painter. Haussmann was in the royal Hessian service, as he was mentioned in a September 1717 letter of recommendation from Landgrave Ernst Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt as \\"Our court painter's son\\". The Landgrave allowed him a study trip through Germany, where he met portraitist Francesco Carlo Rusca at Lugano. Haussmann also met the Dresden court painter Ádám Mányoki, who wrote favorably of him. From 1720 Haussmann was the official portrait painter of the city of Leipzig, but left the city in 1722, probably because of differences with the ' (painters' guild) of Leipzig. Haussman and the guild quarrelled in 1729 and 1742 because he refused to become a burgher or to come to agreements with the guild. These disputes are also accepted as a reason that Mányoki revoked his recommendation. In 1723 Haussmann was appointed court painter to Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. In 1725 he returned to Leipzig. In 1726 he took over the clientele of his predecessor, beginning with a portrait of the merchant Johann Heinrich Linke. In the 1760s, he and his school were replaced by Ernst Gottlob and Anton Graff. Haussmann was also a long-time painter of the Protestant clergy. ==Works== The City Historical Museum of Leipzig, where the Bach portrait hangs, also has several other oil paintings by Haussmann and a variety of his copperplate engravings. Most Haussmann paintings can easily be attributed - he regularly signed his works on the back with his name and the date. Haussmann's early portraits, like that of Gottfried Reiches, display individual composition, technical careful execution, a high level of detail, and realistic emotional expressions. Many later portraits on the other hand, possess typical characteristics of serial images. Especially in the years after 1760, they use the same measurements and often show the subjects in the same attitude. Often there are identical clothes in the same colors within a series of portraits of rather insignificant officials. Georg Müller writes of an \\"image factory\\". Engravings made by others were enhanced with titles, career and personal data. Haussmann's oil paintings and the larger number of etchings show a cross section of the leading layer of the bourgeoisie of Leipzig from the fields of politics, administration, judiciary, the church, business (especially trade and crafts), science and art. Examples include: *Mayor Gottfried Wilhelm Küster *Councillor and builder Kaspar Richter *Councillor and city judge *Pastor Gottlieb Gauditz *Archdeacon Christian Weiß *Councillor and merchant *Merchant Johann Heinrich Linke *Jurist Christian Gottfried Moerlin *University professor August Friedrich Müller *Kapellmeister & Thomaskantor Johann Sebastian Bach *Senior municipal musician Gottfried Reiche *Writer Luise Gottsched ==References== ==Sources== * These include the official main team Leipzig City, 1894–1895 * * * ==External links== * * Altes Rathaus, museum in Leipzig housing many of Haussmann's paintings, including the famous Bach portrait Category:1695 births Category:1774 deaths Category:People from Gera Category:18th-century German painters Category:German male painters Category:German portrait painters Category:Court painters ","title":"Elias Gottlob Haussmann"},{"id":"7775888","text":"Andrés Felipe González Ramírez (born 8 January 1984) is a Colombian footballer. ==Football career== González started his career at local América de Cali, at whose system he arrived at 11, making his professional debuts eight years later.

It is affiliated with California Lutheran University and is a member school of the Graduate Theological Union. ==History== Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary was founded in 1950 and held its first classes in 1952 as a seminary of the United Lutheran Church in America, later the Lutheran Church in America and American Lutheran Church and currently the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). As one of seven seminaries training ministers and educators for the ELCA, PLTS was preceded by a school called the Pacific Lutheran Seminary, which was located first in Portland, Oregon, and then in Seattle, Washington, from 1910 to 1934. As of January 1, 2014, PLTS became the seminary of California Lutheran University, a Lutheran university located in Thousand Oaks, California. The mission of PLTS is to equip people to put their faith into action as the church and culture face dramatic change; because people who follow their purpose can transform a community, and the world. PLTS provides theological education for the training of clergy and lay leaders through ordination, non-ordination, and research level degrees and certificates. Learning at PLTS is an immersion experience with a diversity of people and our engaging campus location in Downtown Berkeley provides a plethora of opportunities for engagement with the church and world. The seminary relocated from its hilltop campus to 2000 Center Street in 2017. ==Academics== PLTS has 9 faculty members, 2 adjunct faculty members, and 5 emeriti faculty members. The seminary offers the following degrees and certificates: Master of Divinity, Master of Theological Studies, Certificate of Theological Studies, and Certificate of Advanced Theological Studies. In collaboration with the Graduate Theological Union, PLTS offers two degrees: Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy or Theology. The seminary serves all of the ELCA and has specific ties to Regions 1 and 2 and the eleven synods of the western U.S. PLTS was founded to meet the missional needs of the Lutheran Church in the western United States. PLTS was a founding member of the Graduate Theological Union. PLTS partners with eleven ELCA synods and with the national units of the ELCA, and several foundations. Together they have worked to develop the Theological Education for Emerging Ministries program. On April 24, 2009, the Board of Directors of PLTS voted unanimously to seek a Reconciling in Christ (RIC) designation from Lutherans Concerned/North America (LC/NA), the first seminary in the ELCA to do so. Shortly thereafter, LC/NA added a new \\"Seminaries\\" category to its list of RIC organizations and made PLTS the first member of that category. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Educational institutions established in 1952 Category:Lutheran seminaries Category:Graduate Theological Union Category:1950 establishments in California Category:Education in Berkeley, California Category:Lutheran buildings and structures in North America ","title":"Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary"},{"id":"7776052","text":"Association Sportive Municipale Belfortaine Football Club is a French association football team from Belfort, Franche-Comté, currently playing in the Championnat National 2, the fourth tier in the French football league system. ==History== The club was founded in 1947 as Association Sportive des Patronages Belfortains and was renamed ASM Belfort 1971 after the merger with US Belfort.

He is widely considered the father of analytical chemistry for his large volume of published research in diverse fields of analysis, his work to modernize and promote the field, and for advising a large number of students who went on to influential careers of their own. Kolthoff's best-known research contribution was the development of the \\"cold process\\" for producing synthetic rubber, which he undertook under the U.S. synthetic rubber program during World War II. He was also active in social causes, including promoting world peace and opposing nuclear weapons testing. Kolthoff received a PhD in chemistry from the University of Utrecht in his native Netherlands. In 1927, he immigrated to the United States, joining the faculty at the University of Minnesota, where he worked for more than 60 years. == Early life and education == Kolthoff was born in Almelo, Netherlands, on February 11, 1894, the son of Moses and Rosetta (Wysenbeek) Kolthoff. He was the youngest of three children. At an early age, Kolthoff received the nickname \\"Piet\\" for unknown reasons; he continued to be called by this nickname throughout his life. Kolthoff's introduction to chemistry in high school inspired a keen interest in the subject. He graduated from high school in 1911 and enrolled at the University of Utrecht in Utrecht, Netherlands. Kolthoff wanted to study chemistry, but at that time students in the physical sciences were required to have studied either Latin or Greek languages; Kolthoff, who was already fluent in Dutch, German French, and English, choose to study pharmacy in order to avoid this requirement. The pharmacy program at Utrecht provided a strong foundation in analytical chemistry. There Kolthoff met Nicholas Schoorl, a professor of pharmacy who became his academic adviser. Schoorl's instruction in analytical chemistry provided an emphasis on fundamental chemical principles, which was unusual at the time. He introduced Kolthoff to research in the areas of electro- analytical chemistry and co-precipitation. He also advised Kolthoff to approach analytical chemistry from a scientific perspective as opposed to an empirical one. Kolthoff would adopt and later promote Schoorl's adage towards research, \\"Theory guides, experiment decides.\\" Kolthoff published his first paper in 1915 on pH, a concept that had been introduced by S. P. L. Sørensen in 1909. Also in 1915, Kolthoff obtained an \\"apotheker\\" degree in pharmacy. He continued his education at Utrecht with advanced courses in physical and colloid chemistry. When the classical language requirement for physical sciences was lifted in 1918, Kolthoff received a PhD in chemistry from the University of Utrecht. By the time he received his doctoral degree, Kolthoff had already published 32 papers in several fields. == Career == Kolthoff remained at the University of Utrecht as a lecturer in electrochemistry and a researcher until 1927. During this time he authored or coauthored 270 papers and three books and promoted the concept of pH, which was not well understood at the time. He also conducted a lecture tour of the United States and Canada in 1924. These activities earned him an international reputation. In 1927 he was offered a one-year appointment at the University of Minnesota. He accepted the position and continued his research and writing, producing English translations and expansions of much of his previous work. The position became permanent, and soon he became professor and chief of the analytical division of the University's school of chemistry. During World War II, Kolthoff worked on a U.S. government-backed research program to develop a synthetic method for producing rubber, and he served as chairman of the Committee on Analytical Research Methods and supervisor of three research projects related to the project. His research in emulsion polymerization and development of a low- temperature \\"cold process\\" for producing synthetic rubber were among his most well-known research contributions. Kolthoff retired in 1962, at which time he had authored 809 research papers. After his retirement, he continued working and published an additional 136 papers, bringing his career total to 945. === Research === Kolthoff worked in several diverse areas of chemistry. They included acid-base titrimetry, electrometric analysis and conductometry, potentiometry, electron transfer, gravimetric analysis and precipitation reactions, polarographic analysis (voltammetry), amperometric titrations, and emulsion polymerization, among others. His reputation for combining fundamental theory and practical application in his work were characteristic throughout his career. Kolthoff's scientific approach to analysis is widely accepted today, but was rare in the early 1900s when his career began. === Teaching === Kolthoff advised 51 doctoral students in chemistry at the University of Minnesota, including Johannes F. Coetzee, Herbert A. Laitinen, James J. Lingane and Ernest B. Sandell, and several other masters and bachelors students. In 1993 it was estimated that more than 1,500 PhD chemists, including Allen J. Bard, could trace their academic lineage to Kolthoff. === Professional contributions === Kolthoff was a proponent for establishing analytical chemistry as a modern scientific discipline and elevating its reputation among chemists generally. Kolthoff was involved in the founding of the American Chemical Society (ACS) Division of Analytical Chemistry in 1938 and the establishment of the Analytical Chemistry Division of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1951. Kolthoff served on the editorial board of the ACS journal Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Analytical Edition from 1935 until 1942 and ACS's Analytical Chemistry when it was introduced in 1948. === Selected list of publications === Kolthoff authored nearly 1,000 scientific papers, nine books, and several other publications over the course of his career. * Der Gebrauch von Farbenindikatoren (1922): Kolthoff's first published monograph. This book went through several German editions and was translated into English in 1926. It was later titled \\"Acid-Base Indicators\\" after being expanded in 1937 with C. Rosenblum as coauthor. * Konduktometrische Titrationen (1924) and Potentiometric Titrations (1926):Kolthoff began to use conductometry and poteniometry in 1918 and 1920, respectively, which led to these two monograms. Potentiometric Titrations was especially influential, not only in analytical chemistry, but in other fields as well. * Massanalyse (two volumes in 1927 and 1928): A continuation of his fundamental studies of classical methods, it was translated and coauthored by N. H. Furman in 1928 under the title \\"Volumetric Analysis.\\" It also appeared much later (1942–1958) in an expanded three-volume edition coauthored by V.A. Stenger, G. Matsuyama, and R. Belcher. * The Colorimetric and Potentiometric Determination of pH (1931): This was Kolthoff's first book that was meant to be used as text for instruction. It was expanded with H. A. Laitinen in 1941 and released under the title \\"pH and Electrotitrations.\\" * Textbook of Quantitative Inorganic Analysis (1936): Co- authored by E. B. Sandell, this book presented fundamentals and experimental features of analysis, and was among Kolthoff's most influential textbooks. In 1969 it appeared under the new title \\"Quantitative Chemical Analysis,\\" with contributions from Sandell, E. J. Meehan, and S. Bruckenstein as coauthors. * Polarography (1941): Co-authored with James J. Lingane, this introduction to voltammetry was expanded in 1952 into two volumes. * Emulsion Polymerization (1955): This book related to Kolthoff's work in synthetic rubber and his development of cold rubber. It was coauthored with F.A. Bovey, A.I. Medalia, and E.J. Meehan. * Treatise on Analytical Chemistry (first edition 1959): Co- published with Philip J. Elving, this is Kolthoff's largest and most notable work. The volume is in three parts: \\"Theory and Practice\\" (11 volumes, published between 1959 and 1976), \\"Analytical Chemistry of Inorganic and Organic Compounds\\" (16 volumes, published between 1961 and 1980), and \\"Analytical Chemistry in Industry\\" (four volumes, completed in 1977) == Personal life and activism == During World War II, Kolthoff worked with the Rockefeller Foundation to relocate European scientists who were persecuted by Nazis to universities in the U.S. Following World War II, he traveled to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia to build cooperation with scientists there. Kolthoff corresponded with science and political leaders including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Linus Pauling and Hubert Humphrey on issues of global importance that included promoting peace and opposing nuclear weapons testing. His correspondence with Frédéric Joliot-Curie about a communist- dominated nuclear weapons conference and his opposition to Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist activities caught the attention of the House Un- American Activities Committee. He was accused of belonging to several subversive organizations, but no actions were taken against him. Kolthoff never married and lived most of his life a short distance from the chemistry building. After retiring, he continued working with his lab assistant Miron Chantooni. Kolthoff died of kidney failure on 4 March 1993 at Bethesda Lutheran Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in St. Paul. ==Awards and honors== Kolthoff was the recipient of many awards, honorary degrees, and other honors throughout his career, some of which are listed below. === Awards and medals === * William H. Nichols Medal, New York Section, American Chemical Society, 1949 * Fisher Award (now called the ACS Award in Analytical Chemistry), American Chemical Society, 1950 * Willard Gibbs Medal Award, Chicago Section, American Chemical Society, 1964 * Charles Medal, Charles University, 1964 * Kolthoff Gold Medal, Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the American Pharmaceutical Association (now the American Pharmacists Association), 1967 * Award for Excellence in Education (now called the J. Calvin Giddings Award for Excellence in Education), American Chemical Society Division of Analytical Chemistry, 1983 * Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science, Royal Society of Chemistry, 1984 === Honorary degrees === * University of Chicago, 1955 * University of Groningen, 1964 * Brandeis University, 1974 * The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1975 === Other honors === Kolthoff was named a Commander in the Order of Orange-Nassau, a civil and military honor provided by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in 1947. In 1958, Kolthoff was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an honorary member of the American Pharmaceutical Association, and an honorary member of eight foreign chemical societies. The Regents of the University of Minnesota named the university's 1972 chemistry building Kolthoff Hall in his honor. The university's Department of Chemistry began the annual Kolthoff Lectureship in 1979. On his eightieth birthday, the Division of Analytical Chemistry of the American Chemical Society sponsored the I.M. Kolthoff 80th Anniversary Symposium. The Division offers the I. M. Kolthoff Enrichment Awards for Undergraduate Students. Kolthoff was inducted into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame in 1985 and the Minnesota Science and Technology Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2014, the American Chemical Society named Kolthoff's contributions to modern analytical chemistry a National Historic Chemical Landmark. == References == ==External links== *National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir Category:1894 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Almelo Category:People from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:20th-century American chemists Category:Dutch emigrants to the United States Category:University of Minnesota faculty ","title":"Izaak Kolthoff"},{"id":"7776125","text":"Washoe traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Washoe people of the Lake Tahoe and surrounding Sierra Nevada area of eastern California and western Nevada.

He then went on to play for several teams, such as Deportivo Saprissa, Ramonense, Municipal Puntarenas, Sagrada Familia, Guanacasteca and San Carlos. ==Coaching career== Kenton retired from professional football in 1989, and began a very successful and international coaching career. His first coaching job was as assistant coach to Bora Milutinovic in the Costa Rica's national squad that played the 1990 World Cup held in Italy, where Costa Rica had a great performance and reached the second round, against all odds. In Costa Rica, he has had short coaching periods at Costa Rica's first division, with Herediano and Alajuelense during the mid-1990s, but neither team gave him enough time to build his ideas and process. So, he went back to international football and in 1998, he was asked by Milutinovic to be his assistant coach again, this time with the Nigeria national football team that played the 1998 World Cup that took place in France. After completing the Nigeria job, he returned to take charge of Puntarenas only to be dismissed in October 1998.Sacudida en Puntarenas • Kenton fuera del equipo; cinco jugadores separados - Nación By the early 2000s, he took charge of the Costa Rica U23 team, and qualified them to the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens.

Following the international trend of teen pop girl groups established by the Spice Girls, the five members of Bandana — Ivonne Guzmán, Lourdes Cecilia Fernández, Valeria Gastaldi, Virginia Da Cunha and María Elizabeth Vera — were selected on the TV show Popstars and were a carefully marketed product that became a phenomenon in the country, particularly among young girls. ==History== Their self-titled debut album was released in 2001 on Sony BMG Records, led by the hit single \\"Guapas\\", and was certified four-times platinum by the CAPIF. Despite being initially snubbed by many critics and artists, Bandana emerged as Argentina's best-selling act since 2001. At the time of their disbandment in 2004, the combined sales of Bandana's three studio albums were estimated to be 450,000 copies sold. Their career was marked by several landmarks for Argentine musicians — specially bearing in mind the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression: 280 thousand tickets were sold to see them perform in the Teatro Gran Rex (with a total of 86 concerts in the venue); they performed twice for a total of 90 thousand people in the José Amalfitani Stadium; and released Vivir intentando, a film starring themselves that was seen by over 1 million people. In 2016, Bandana announced a reunion concert (without Ivonne Guzmán) at the Lola Membrives Theatre in Buenos Aires; due to the high demand for tickets, the group has added five more dates. The concerts sold out within an hour and a half. The band also released a new album, titled La Vuelta which contains new versions of some of their biggest hits. On January 16, 2017, the band released their first original song ever since 2003 entitled \\"Bombón\\". The following day, da Cunha announced her departure from the band. In March, 2017 the 3 Bandana members, Lourdes, Valeria and Lisa, flew to the US to record the music video for their first single since their comeback, \\"Bombón\\" featuring Wisin. The music video was produced and directed by Lourival Rodriguez and co- directed by Ruslan Shakirov. It was shot in a Mansion in Miami Beach, FL. Following da Cunha's departure, the band continues to release new singles, including \\"No No No\\" and \\"Baila\\" in 2018, and their latest single, \\"En la Punta de la Lengua\\" in February 2019. ==Members== The original group consisted of 5 girls: * Ivonne Guzmán (2001—04) * Lourdes Cecilia Fernández (2001—04, 2016—present) * Valeria Gastaldi (2001—04, 2016—present) * Virginia Da Cunha (2001—04, 2016—17) * María Elizabeth Vera (2001—04, 2016—present) All the girls hailed from Buenos Aires, apart from Guzmán, who is a native of Colombia. Upon the band's comeback tour in 2016, Guzmán decided not to return, being the only member who did not rejoin. Guzmán's role was not replaced. On January 17, 2017, da Cunha revealed through her Instagram account she had left the band to focus on her solo career. The rest of the members announced subsequently that they would not replace da Cunha and instead, would continue as a 3-girl group. ==Casting== Formed in 2001 on the reality TV show Popstars, 5 girls were selected from 5,000's of contestants who had attended the casting. Their emergence coincided with a period of nationwide economic depression. As such, their success contrasted greatly with the general mood of the country, & one of the judges commented that \\"this was an opportunity to shine at a very downbeat moment for Argentina\\".\\"El sueño del estrellato veloz convertido en realidad\\" Página 12 Article Julián Gorodischer 01-11-2001 The final line-up was unusual in the sense that the girls didn't conform to traditional ideas of beauty: Ivonne wore braces & Lourdes was known as la peti (shorty) due to her height. Judge Afo Verde noted that \\"appearance didn't matter to us, what each girl conveyed was most important\\". == Musical history == Their first self-titled album, Bandana, was the best-selling album of 2001 in Argentina, turning platinum soon after release and achieving 4 platinum certifications.Biography Music.com, Drago Bonacich 18-06-2004 It spawned a number of hits including Cómo Puede Ser, Guapas & Maldita Noche. They also completed a successful tour, selling out Buenos Aires' biggest theatre, Teatro Gran Rex, more than 40 times during winter vacations (July). Later in 2002, they recorded a Spanish version of Can't Help Falling in Love by Elvis Presley (Muero De Amor Por Tí), for the Disney film Lilo & Stitch . In 2002, they released their second album, Noche (Night), which wasn't as successful as the first but it was still the best-selling album of 2002 in Argentina.http://www.portalcomunicacion.com/both/opc/argentina2003.pd In 2003, they released their third studio album, titled Vivir Intentando which was also the soundtrack of their film of the same name released during the same year. They also won Best New Artist—Southeast at the MTV Video Music Awards Latin America.Best New Artist Southeast – Winners , MTVLA.com — MTV Video Music Awards Latinoamérica In December 2002, they performed a joint concert with Mambrú in the José Amalfitani Stadium stadium with over 40,000 tickets sold.

They revealed through interviews that reuniting had always been a possibility, but it kept being postponed due to some of the members' pregnancies and other professional commitments. A new album, La Vuelta was released to celebrate their reunion, which contains revised versions of some of their biggest hits. The track list is also the set list of their tour. On January 16, 2017, the group released their first original song since 2003 entitled \\"Bombón\\" featuring Puerto Rican rapper Wisin. The following day, da Cunha revealed she had left the band, hence why she did not participate in the recording of this song. This brand new song serves as the main theme of one of Telefé's reality show, Despedida de Soltero (Stag Party). == Cultural Impact == Following on from a trend established by the Spice Girls in the UK & internationally in the late 1990s, Bandana became a carefully marketed product which was especially popular among young girls. Many licensed products with their brand were available to purchase, and contributed to the heightened interest in the group, occasionally referred to as 'Bandanamania'.Biography MTVLA.com Their signature bandanas of varying colours were quickly imitated by the teen population, as were their lyrics & dance routines. From 2001 to 2003, there was an official Bandana store selling much merchandise. The store was located at Avenida Corrientes, right besides Teatro Gran Rex. == Vivir Intentando (Go For It) == In 2003 they released their first movie, Vivir Intentando, filmed on location in Buenos Aires. It premiered in Argentina on 14 June 2003,IMDB Release Dates and met with mixed reviews.

They are part of the Gorgate subclan of the Hawiye clan,Puccioni 1937, 37, Luling 1971, 30, and Cassanelli 1973, 30 which is one of the major clans of Somali people. The Silcis inhabit the traditional coastal region of Benadir in the southern part of Somalia. This region should not be confused with the much smaller present day Banaadir administrative region (gobol) which contains Somalia’s capital Mogadishu. Silcis live, or have historically lived, along the Shabeelle River in towns such as Afgooye and Jowhaar, as well as along the coast, especially in Mogadishu and Warsheekh. ==Emergence and early history== The Silcis rose to prominence in the Shabeelle River region following the disintegration of the Ajuuraan Sultanate, which controlled a large part of southern Somalia, and with which the Silcis are connected.Luling 1990, 111 Cassanelli points out that in Geledi oral history accounts, the Silcis are often viewed as \\"that section of the Ajuran who governed the Afgoy district\\".Cassanelli 1973, 38 He asserts that Geledi accounts \\"attest to the continuity and similarity of Ajuran and Sil'is rule\\". The Silcis centre of power was in Lama Jiidle (present day Afgooye).Luling 1971, 30 Lama Jiidle means \\"two roads\\" in Somali. Barile erroneously claims that Afgooye's previous name was simply \\"Seles\\" (the common Italian spelling of Silcis).Barile 1935, 109 The Silcis imposed taxation on their subject clans, such as the Wacdaan, a fellow subclan of the Gurgate Hawiye, and the Geledi, a Rahanweyn subclan.Cassanelli 1982, 111 According to Virginia Luling, \\"The Sil'is imposed their dominion on the Geledi, who had to pay as tribute a measure (suus) of grain every day from each household; it was collected and loaded on a camel, others say a donkey. A tax was also imposed on those who brought their stock to water at the river”.Luling 1971, 30–31 Barile also describes the taxes levied by the Silcis.Barile 1935, 79-80 A controversial aspect of traditional Geledi and Wacdaan accounts of Silcis rule is the imposition by the Silcis sultan of ius primae noctis.Cassanelli 1973, 38 According to Eno, \\"it was ‘Xeer’ [customary] for every Geledi bride... to celebrate her honeymoon [first] with a Silcis-Gorgaate male before she could celebrate the occasion with her official marital husband\\".Eno 2005, 108 Luling, however, points out that ius primae noctis was \\"A habit regularly attributed to tyrants in this part of Somalia”.Luling 1971, 36 It is thus possible that the accounts of the Silcis practice were exaggerated by the clans they ruled. It is not known to what extent the Silcis sultans engaged in this practice. However, the importance of this account to Geledi and Wacdaan history should not be discounted or dismissed. ==Overthrow of Silcis== The final ruler of the Silcis in Lama Jiidle (Afgooye) was the sultan 'Umur Abukar Abroone.Luling 1971, 31 According to Luling, \\"His daughter Imbia used to go round collecting the daily tribute of grain, accompanied by her slaves\\" Luling 1971, 31 from her father's Wacdaan and Geledi subjects. Oral accounts hold that one day, \\"when the Sultan's daughter came round to collect the tribute, she got a beating instead of the grain\\", as the Geledi refused to pay.Luling 1971, 31 When Imbia reported this event to her father, he exclaimed \\"waa la i afgooye\\", literally \\"they have cut off my mouth\\", meaning that the regime's source of provision had been terminated. Lama Jiidle's name became Afgooye to commemorate this victory over the Silcis. According to Cassanelli, “the Geledi (Rahanweyn) and Wa'dan (Darandolle Gurgate) allied to drive the Sil'is from Afgoy”.Cassanelli 1973, 41 The Silcis Sultanate in the Afgooye region was replaced by the Geledi Sultanate.Cassanelli 1973, 56 ==Later history== Some authors claim that the Silcis ceased to be a significant group after their overthrow in Afgooye. Puccioni states that \\"the Silcis were reduced to a small, sparse grouping along the Shabeelle from Afgooye to Bulo Mererta [“i Seles sono ridotti a piccoli raggruppamenti sparsi lungo lo Scebeli da Afgoi a Bulo Mererta”].Puccioni 1937, 39 Luling claims that the Silcis \\"became an insignificant, scattered people”.Luling 1971, 32 It is apparent, however, from the historical record beginning in the 19th century that the Silcis became established at Warsheekh and that this became their new centre. The Italian colonial administration signed a \\"TREATY of Peace, Friendship and Protection\\" with the \\"Chiefs of Warsheekh (Seles Gorgate and Abgal)\\" on August 26, 1894.Haji 2001, 73 The Italians also confirmed Haji Mao Mallim Elmi, a Silcis member, as the chief of Warsheekh in 1897.Haji 2001, 75 In 1951, a large number of representatives of the Silcis submitted an appeal to the United Nations Advisory Council for the Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian Administration, in order to protest the taking of Silcis lands by Italians. The signatories submitted the appeal “on behalf of the Seles Gorgate inhabitants living in Warsheikh, Giohar, Harar, Jigjiga, Mogadishu and Afgoi\\".Haji 2001, 150–151 ==Notes== ==References== *Barile, Pietro.

Holtreman is a spelling version of the Oultreman family name.Biographie Générale Depuis Les Temps Les Plus Reculés - Tome Trente- Septième The Holtreman name was adopted in Portugal by an Oultreman’s family branch originally from Valenciennes. In the early 17th century, a knight called Jean (John) Houltremant (or d’Oultreman) served the Count of Vila Real in the reign of Philip III of Portugal (Philip IV of Spain). Jean Houltremant descended from an old lineage from the County of Flanders and the County of Hainaut being a grandson of Jacques d’Oultreman dit Houltreman, adviser of his majesty at Namur. Jean married Ana Antónia Nunes, daughter of Manuel Nunes and wife Ana Nunes, landowners of the Anadia region in Portugal. After the Portuguese Restoration War, Jean descendency is believed to have adopted his wife's family name of Nunes, and moved to Pousaflores into his wife's family lands. The Holtremant name was later recovered in the 18th century by Bartolomeu Nunes Holtremant, Knight of the Order of Christ and by his cousin - and godson - Manuel Ribeiro Holtremant, Knight of the Order of Saint James. Due to Portuguese pronunciation, all their descendants have adopted the Holtreman spelling. In Portugal, the family is better known because of the foundation of Sporting Clube de Portugal (often erroneously known as \\"Sporting Lisbon\\"). The d'Oultreman family obtained several recognition of nobility from both the Habsburgs's Austrian and Spanish branches, and from Charles I of Portugal. In the County of Flanders and the County of Hainaut, both Flemish and French were spoken across both counties, explaining why the name suffered minor spelling changes depending on where the family member lived or was born. The most commons are Oultreman (or Houltreman) and Oultremant (or Houltremant). The family descends from the Knight known as the Oultreman of Ghent (or Woutreman van Ghent, in Dutch) – the family origins in Ghent are well documented. Born Woutre van Ghent (1214–1261), he was the youngest son of Zeger II, Viscount de Gand (himself grandson of William of Ypres, legitimated son of Phillip of Ypres and his concubine, madam of Loo) and Petronella of Coutrai. As governor of Oostende he adapted the suffix \\"MAN\\" in 1229 being styled Woutreman I Van Ghent Histoire de la Ville et Comté de Valenciennes (or Watreman de Gand, in French Coutumes des pays et comté de Flandre : Quartier de Bruges, Coutumes des petites villes et seigneuries enclavées by Belgique.

Jean was born around 1420, married Barbe Van der Walle and his descendency settled in Valenciennes where they become Lords of Rombies, of Jollain, of de la Marlier, and du Chastelet, etc. Several member of this family held prominent positions, namely: * Antoine d'Oultreman - Historian of the Abbey of Saint Jean * Henri d'Oultreman – Mayor of Valenciennes, Lord of Rombies, and Author of \\"Histoire de la ville et comté de Valenciennes\\" * Jacques d'Outreman - Prominent Antiquarian of Valenciennes * Philippe d'Oultreman - Jesuit and Religious Historian * Jean-François d'Oultreman - Knight, Lord of de Chastelet, Hamal, etc * Charlotte d'Oultreman de Tornielly - Marchioness of Surco * Fernando Cayetano Suarez de Figueroa y Tornielly Mena Carranza d'Oultreman - Knight of the Order of Calatrava * Jean d'Oultreman - Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, Lord of de la Marlière et du Chastelet, Mayor of Valenciennes == Holtreman in Portugal == Although the family is better known in Portugal for the foundation of the soccer club Sporting Clube de Portugal, among their descendants in Portugal one can find: * Alfredo Augusto das Neves Holtreman – founder of Sporting Clube de Portugal * António Maria Holtreman do Rego Botelho de Faria, Count of Rego Botelho * António Luís (Holtreman)-Roquette Ricciardi – Patriarch and head of the Espirito Santo family * Bartolomeu Nunes Holtreman - Knight of the Order of Christ * Carlos Augusto Holtreman Franco - Guilhermina Suggia prize in 1966, Co-founder of the \\"Grupo de Música Contemporânea de Lisboa\\" * João Maria Holtreman do Rego - Co-founder of the Portuguese Chemical Society * João Lopes Holtreman - founder of the Portuguese Antiquarian Booksellers Association * José Alfredo Holtreman-Roquette (José Alvalade) - founder of Sporting Clube de Portugal * José Alfredo Parreira Holtreman-Roquette - well known businessman and former President of Sporting Clube de Portugal * José Carlos Xavier Holtreman - Artist, Actor, and Writer * Hugo (Holtreman- Roquette) Ricciardi O'Neill, the current head of the Clanaboy O'Neill dynasty - the senior branch of the High Kings of Ireland * Victor de Oliveira Holtreman - Owner and CEO of GameRant.com,GameRant.com a popular video game news website that is visited over 5 million times a month Nowadays, there are mainly two family branches holding the Holtreman name in Portugal: The Holtreman-Roquette branch, being the senior male representative José Alfredo Parreira Holtreman Roquette, and the Holtreman branch, being the senior male representative Victor de Oliveira Holtreman, born and living in the United States of America without male descendants.

The western terminus of SR 550 is at an interchange with U.S. Route 33 (US 33) just north of the city limits of Athens, immediately south of the southern terminus of SR 13. The eastern terminus of SR 550 is at an intersection with SR 7 just west of Marietta. ==Route description== Along its way, SR 550 passes through the counties of Athens and Washington. There is no section of the highway that is incorporated within the National Highway System. ==History== The route connecting Athens and Marietta has been a state highway since the system's creation in Ohio in the 1910s. Prior to 1922, the route was known as SR 157. Between 1923 and 1929, the route became the southernmost part of SR 26. In 1929, the SR 26 designation was removed and replaced by a part of U.S. Route 50N, a divided route from US 50. This route ran from Athens at US 50 east to Marietta. It then continued west along the Ohio River, concurrent with SR 7 to Newport where it crossed into St. Marys, West Virginia on the Clarksburg-Columbus Short Route Bridge, later renamed the Hi Carpenter Bridge in 1967, an eyebar- chain suspension bridge. In West Virginia, it traveled along WV 16 until it joined US 50S in Ellenboro. By 1935, the mainline of US 50 was signed along US 50S between Athens and Pike, West Virginia and the former US 50N became U.S. Route 50 Alternate (US 50 Alt.). The routing of US 50 Alt. would remain unchanged throughout its history except when the Hi Carpenter Bridge was closed in 1968 due to similarities in design to the Silver Bridge which collapsed in 1967. A temporary ferry between Newport and St. Marys was utilized until the new Hi Carpenter Memorial Bridge opened in 1977. Also, when US 50 was moved onto a freeway in West Virginia in 1973, US 50 Alt.'s eastern terminus was moved back to Ellenboro, albeit at an interchange with the US 50 freeway. The designation of SR 550 took place in 1976. Since the route became SR 550, no major changes have taken place to the routing. At least part of the route of 550 is based on the original Marietta-Chillicothe Stagecoach Road. ==Major intersections== ==References== 550 Category:Transportation in Athens County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Washington County, Ohio Category:U.S. Route 50 ","title":"Ohio State Route 550"},{"id":"7776286","text":"Compound analgesics are those with multiple active ingredients; they include many of the stronger prescription analgesics. Active ingredients that have been commonly used in compound analgesics include: * aspirin or ibuprofen * caffeine * codeine or oxycodone * paracetamol (acetaminophen) * phenacetin Several such formulations have disappeared from over-the-counter status in drug store aisles and other retail outlets. One example is APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) compound tablets common from the 1940s to 1983; because of harmful side effects of phenacetin, Anacin in the U.S. was reformulated to eliminate it; while Vincent's APC is no longer sold. Some others have been judged to contribute too often to substance abuse. Another example is Bex, a once popular Australian compound analgesic which is no longer sold.

He was one of the driving forces behind the Canadian Football League as coach, general manager, team president, and league president. As head coach, he was a five-time Grey Cup winner with three different teams. Hayman was a pioneer in bringing African Americans into the CFL, hiring one of professional football's first Black player, Herb Trawick, and coach Willie Wood. He was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. ==Early years== Hayman was born to a Jewish family in New York City and grew up in Paterson, New Jersey. He attended high school at New York Military Academy and was a star basketball player at Syracuse University, where he was a three-year starter and named College Humor third team All-American in 1931. He also played for the Syracuse football team. ==Moves to Canada== After graduating from college, Hayman moved to Canada in 1932 to become assistant coach of the University of Toronto football team under Warren Stevens. He was soon also hired as an assistant to coach Buck McKenna with the Toronto Argonauts football team. When McKenna took ill during the 1932 season, Hayman became interim head coach. He was given the job outright for the 1933 season and, at the age of 25, guided the Argonauts to a Grey Cup championship. He followed that with back-to-back Grey Cup wins in 1937 and 1938. With World War II escalating, the major Canadian football leagues halted operations following the 1941 season and Hayman joined the Royal Canadian Air Force as a flying officer. He was made coach of Toronto's RCAF football team and led the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes to the 1942 Grey Cup championship. He was discharged after the war, having reached the rank of flight lieutenant. Hayman thought he had an agreement with the Argonauts to return as head coach when play resumed in 1945, but the deal fell through and Ted Morris was hired instead. That left Hayman with bitter feelings toward his former team—which admitted that they had misled him\\"Morris succeeds Hayman at helm,\\" Toronto Star, August 16, 1945—and Hayman had to settle for a job as coach of the Toronto Indians football team. One of the members of the Indians was future CFL commissioner Jake Gaudaur, who had also played under Hayman in the RCAF. ==Forms the Montreal Alouettes== The following season, Hayman partnered with Eric Cradock and Leo Dandurand to form the Montreal Alouettes CFL team, with Hayman as head coach and general manager, as well as part- owner. In his first season, he broke the league's color barrier by signing Herb Trawick, an African American lineman. Other innovations introduced by the Alouettes under Hayman were playing night games, scheduling games on Sundays, and allowing games to be televised. During the off-season in 1946, Hayman became general manager of the Toronto Huskies professional basketball team, the first Canadian-based team in what evolved into the National Basketball Association (known at the time as the Basketball Association of America). When the team's first coach quit a month into the season, Hayman took his place for one game, and is in the record books as having been an NBA coach for that single game. The Huskies disbanded after one money-losing season. Hayman led the Alouettes to their first Grey Cup in 1949 — Hayman's fifth and final Grey Cup as head coach. Following the 1951 season, Hayman stepped down as coach but continued as general manager until the end of the 1954 season. Following the latter, he sold his share of the Alouettes and moved back to Toronto to become a stockbroker. ==Returns to the Argonauts== Hayman's career outside of football was short-lived, as he became managing director of the Argonauts in 1956. Despite his previous success as head coach, the Argonauts were largely reduced to being Eastern Conference doormats through this period, finishing last in their division nine times in 11 years from 1956 to 1966 before returning to respectability. During that time, Hayman also became team president. He was elected president of the CFL in 1969 and served a one-year term. After John Barrow was made general manager of the Argonauts in 1972, Hayman was given the title of executive consultant. He was planning to retire when the season ended, but was persuaded by owner John Bassett to sign a three-year contract as team president, followed by 10 years as vice-chairman and director. Hayman again became president of the Argonauts in 1979 and remained in that role until he was succeeded by Ralph Sazio during the 1981 season. He died in 1984 at age 75. Hayman was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1975. The CFL award presented to the outstanding Canadian player in the East Division is called the Lew Hayman Trophy. In 2004, he was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. ==Sources== * \\"Lew Hayman devoted his life to pro football,\\" Rex McLeod, Toronto Star, July 2, 1984, p.

He was also known as Mahakavi (\\"Great Poet\\") or Mahakavi Muddana. His name at birth was Lakshmi Naaranappa (Kannada:ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿ ನಾರಣಪ್ಪ). His birthplace being Nandalike, he is sometimes also known as Nandalike Lakshminaaranappa. His best known works include Ratnavati Kalyaana(Yakshagana), Sri Rama Pattaabhisheka, Adbhuta Ramayana and Sri Ramashwamedha.He coined the word Kannadam Kasthuriyanthe, where he heartily compares his beloved language Kannada to Kasthuri. Suffering poverty and poor health, Muddana died at the age of 31. His literary works have been used extensively in Kannada literary educational books. ==Early life== Lakshmi Naranappa was born on 24 January 1870 in Nandalike in Karkala taluk in Karnataka, India. His father was Pathaali Timmappaiah and mother Mahalakshmamma. His physical attractiveness earned him the nickname Muddana, which comes from Muddu (cute) in the Kannada language.Kavi Muddana. Department of Post, India ==Literary works== Muddana's most famous literary works include: * Ratnavati Kalyana (Yakshagana play) * Kumara Vijaya ( Yakshagana play) * Sri Rama Pattaabhishekam (poetry in Vardhaka Shatpadi format) * Adbhuta Ramayanam * Sri Ramashwedham ==Anonymous writings== ==Muddana== As a young man, Muddana was modesty and shy. He therefore published some of his initial works anonymously. These published literary works include Adbhuta Ramayanam (in modern Kannada prose style), Sri Rama Pattabhishekam (242 Shatpadi format poetry stanzas), ಹಾಗೂ Sri Ramashwemedham (reputedly his greatest work). Muddana had informed to the publisher that, these works were written by ancient people and that he got these works through his ancestors, and that he did not have any kind of additional information. In the years 1895, 1896 and 1899–1901, these literary works were first published by M.A. Ramanuja Iyyangar and S.G. Narasimhachar of Mysore, Karnataka in their magazines Karnataka Kavya Manjari and Karnataka Kavya Kalaanidhi. Muddana had already sent several of his other works for publishing, in the name of \\"ancient works\\", that helped the publisher to believe even these three important works to be of ancient origin and not from Muddana. His authorship was still unknown at the time of his death in 1901. It emerged in 1929 (that is, 28 years after his death), when Central College Karnataka Association in Bangalore published its Muddana Commemorative Edition book. At that time, Muddana's friends, fellow writers such as Panje Mangesharaya, Benegal Rama Rao, Hurali Bheema Rao, Malali Subba Rao gathered and aggregated all the information they had about Muddana, and proved that those three literary works were indeed written by Muddana and no one else.

Arizona to which he was attached where he was > stunned and knocked down by the explosion of a large bomb which hit the > quarterdeck, penetrated several decks, and started a severe fire. Upon > regaining consciousness, he began to direct the fighting of the fire and the > rescue of wounded and injured personnel. Almost immediately there was a > tremendous explosion forward, which made the ship appear to rise out of the > water, shudder and settle down by the bow rapidly. The whole forward part of > the ship was enveloped in flames which were spreading rapidly, and wounded > and burned men were pouring out of the ship to the quarterdeck. Despite > these conditions, his harrowing experience, and severe enemy bombing and > strafing, at the time, Lieutenant Commander Fuqua continued to direct the > fighting of fires in order to check them while the wounded and burned could > be taken from the ship, and supervised the rescue of these men in such an > amazingly calm and cool manner and with such excellent judgement, that it > inspired everyone who saw him and undoubtedly resulted in the saving of many > lives.

The southern terminus of State Route 682 is at a trumpet interchange with US 33, US 50 and SR 32 in Athens. Its northern terminus is at SR 13 in the village of Chauncey, Ohio. SR 682, which was designated in the late 1930s, exists entirely within Athens County, and serves as a southern bypass for the city of Athens. It passes near the main campus of Ohio University. ==Route description== The entirety of SR 682 is located in the central part of Athens County. It is not a component of the National Highway System, a system of highways deemed most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. ==History== When it was established in 1937, SR 682 ran from the SR 56 junction just southwest of Athens to the point where SR 682 currently meets the connector road to US 33 just southwest of Chauncey, and northwest of where SR 682 crosses over the Hocking River. At the time, this was where SR 682 met the predecessor to what would later become the first routing of US 33 through this area, known at the time as SR 31. By 1961, a new stretch of expressway opened to the south of Chauncey. A re-routing of US 33 out of Chauncey and onto this new expressway resulted in an extension of SR 682 northeasterly into the village along the former two-lane routing of US 33 up to the state highway's current northern terminus at the SR 13 junction (the remainder of the old 33 became an extension for SR 13).

The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves is \\"the oldest continually existing horse thief apprehending organization in the United States, and one of Dedham's most venerable social organizations.\\" Since its founding there have been more than 10,000 members including heads of state, Supreme Court justices, governors, popes, professors, generals, and other notables. At one time membership of the \\"ancient and well known society\\" was limited to \\"the pillars of society\\" and the \\"very flower and pick of the vigor, manhood and rising youth of the vicinity.\\" It has also been said that \\"for sheer whimsy, the Society... is without peer.\\" Today it is a tax exempt non-profit social organization that continues to meet \\"just in case.\\" ==Early years== The Society was formed inside the Norfolk House, then known as Marsh's Tavern. At the turn of the 19th century the citizens of Dedham, Massachusetts came together to combat the rash of horse thievery that was afflicting their community. At the time, \\"this posse of vigilantes was a real civic necessity,\\" and during that time period at least 72 such organizations existed in New England. Thirteen men first met on June 4, 1810, at Marsh’s Tavern on Court Street and opened a subscription list, noting that > The great number of horses stolen from amongst us and in our vicinity is > truly alarming, and calls for the attention of every well-disposed Citizen. > It is evident that there has been, and probably will continue, a combination > of Villains through the northern states to carry into effect this malignant > design, and their frequent escape from the hand of justice stimulates them > to that atrocious practice. And as that kind of property is most liable to > be carried out of our knowledge, it requires the utmost exertion of every > good member of society, to baffle and suppress depredations of this kind... On May 4, 1832, the Society opened a bank account at the Dedham Institution for Savings and the account remains open today, and the bank claims that the account \\"may be the oldest continuously active account in the United States.\\" It is the oldest active account at Dedham Savings. ==Membership== Anyone may be nominated for membership so long as the $10 (In 1906 it was $1) membership fee is paid. Applications for membership in the Society must be approved by a majority vote by current members and a \\"controversial nomination years ago of Ayatollah Khamenei of Iran was not seconded.\\" By 1960, the president of the Society reported that \\"memberships are as coveted as the Kentucky Colonels.\\" The person receiving honor of the membership in the society need not even know that they had been nominated. Robert Hanson, who has followed in the steps of his father and grandfather as clerk-treasurer of the Society, has said \\"I've always wondered what the reaction in the Vatican mail room is when they open the envelope and see the certificate.\\" Former Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis is a member, though when a reporter asked him he said he had never heard of the Society. Membership was originally limited to residents of Dedham but restrictions were loosened over the years to limit membership to residents of Norfolk County; or to residents of Norfolk and Suffolk Counties; or to persons resident within a 20-mile radius of the Norfolk County Courthouse; or to residents of Dedham, Norwood, Westwood, or Dover. Eventually all residency restrictions were lifted. The club's website claims that Robert Ripley of Ripley's Believe It or Not! fame had applied for membership before this restriction was eliminated, and the clerk-treasurer returned his application with a note rejecting his application. > Dear Mr. Ripley: Since you are not a resident of Dedham (or Norwood, or > Westwood, or Dover, or Norfolk County, of Suffolk County), you cannot join > our Society.

In 1904, a horse and buggy were stolen from Broad Oak and the Society was called into action. In 1906 an animal was stolen from Scarry’s Livery Stable on Eastern Avenue. The alarm was raised, fliers were distributed, and members set off in motor cars, but they failed to find the stolen horse. While by this time the Town of Dedham had a professional police force who was primarily responsible for tracking down the thief, at one point the chief of police was reporting to the Society. The clerk of the society reported at the annual meeting that though the animal was not recovered, it was not for a lack of trying: \\"It is only fair to the Riders of this Society to state that the owner of the horse even consulted mediums in his efforts to find the horse. This only proves that our Riders did their full duty, as the horse could not be found.\\" By 1906, with the advent of the automobile, the world, and the Society, were changing, prompting the Boston Herald to run the following Dedham Dittie: > It was not like that in the olden says in dear old Dedham town, In the > limping, scrimping olden days, when they ran a horse thief down. Then each > man rode off on his fastest horse, and he rode both fast and far, But now > the rider hunts the thief in a chugging motor car. The last time the Society investigated a horse theft was in 1909, although though a number of pranks between members set off false alarms after that. In days when vigilante justice was a major component of the Society, \\"not a few horse thieves were apprehended by the organization of the long name.\\" ===Proposed switch to automobiles=== By 1915, it was said that \\"without doubt\\" the organization's existence scared away potential horse thieves, as evidenced by the decreasing number of thefts of horses and increasing number of automobile thefts. President George F. Joyce proposed changing the purpose of the organization to those who steal automobiles and auto parts. In 1921 and 1924, the Society was still debating whether to turn its attention to car thieves. In 1925 no horses were stolen, but a cow was recovered. In 1932, it was proposed that a Society in Dedham for Apprehending Hit-and-Run Drivers would be a good successor organization. It was also predicted that by 2032, when human flight would be common, that there would be a Society for Apprehending Reckless Aviators over Dedham. A newspaper in West Virginia once suggested that the Society not only turn its attention to catching auto thieves, but anarchists as well. ==Move to a social organization== By 1899, horse thefts were becoming so rare that newspapers as far away as The Evening Times of Washington, D.C. were noting that \\"it might seem to the ordinary observer that the members ought to devote themselves to something worth doing, now that their particular object in life has disappeared.\\" However, in 1931 it was said that \\"Dedham doesn't purpose to let an old tradition languish simply for lack of horse thieves.\\" At the turn of the 20th century, under the guidance of its new president, Dr. Edward Knobel, its annual meeting became a social event with dinner, drink, and entertainment. Elbert Hubbard was the keynote speaker at the annual dinner in 1908. He spoke on the poetry of Robert Browning and said \\"a more refined and intelligent audience I never saw.\\" He reported that the membership was limited to 350 men and that there was a perpetual waiting list to join with \\"the slightest fleck on your social record\\" being cause to be rejected. The organization met in a variety of taverns and other public buildings around town throughout the years. In 1893 the annual meeting was held at the Grand Army of the Republic hall in Dedham Square, and 1907 the organization met at Greenleaf Hall. By 1920, and as late as 1956, it met at Memorial Hall, where the Police Station now stands. Eventually the meetings moved to the old high school around the time of the First World War and then to the current high school when it was constructed in the 1960s. While alcohol was forbidden in the schools, it was a convenient setup with both a cafeteria and an auditorium, and surprise was expressed yearly at the variety of colors of \\"water\\" in glasses. Attendance steadily increased at the annual meeting and beginning in the 1970s the organization met at Moseley's on the Charles. In the early 1900s, the committee of Riders were elected based on their weight, \\"so that when a thief is captured his captors can sit on him to prevent him from escaping.\\" Riders were required to weigh at least 200 pounds. The organization represented New England at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Today, donations are occasionally made to local charitable organizations. ==21st century== The annual meeting of the Society takes place on the first Tuesday of December each year. At the 192nd annual meeting in 2002 \\"more than 200 proud members... toasted their success last night at their annual meeting, a bacchanalian affair featuring bad jokes, old- time music, a generous amount of both spirit and spirits and a virtual who's who of political and business life.\\" In 2007 members came from as far away as California, just to attend the dinner. One member, whose \\"hulking frame could barely contain his enthusiasm for the group,\\" told a reporter that the annual meeting was \\"the greatest event in the history of Dedham, ever. And the best part is, it has no redeeming value whatsoever, except for pointless fun and unbelievable camaraderie.\\" Some years, photos of horses are brought in \\"to acquaint riders who may never have seen one before.\\" For many years it was a men's only club, but in 2012 Margo Pyle became the Society's first female Rider, or one who is responsible for searching for horse thieves when one is stolen. Being elected a Rider is \\"a position of signal honor.\\" ==Offshoot organizations== While many similar private anti-theft organizations existed at the time the Society was founded, there have been at least two organizations inspired by the Society directly. In 1841, 42 of 76 original members began a new organization, the Society in Dedham for Apprehending and Prosecuting Thieves. The Society in Hampton Beach for the Apprehension of Those Falsely Accusing Eunice (Goody) Cole of Having Familiarity with the Devil was formed in 1936 in direct response to learning about the Society in Dedham. The Horse Thieves Tavern at the corner of Washington and High Streets in Dedham Square also took its name from the Society. ==References== ==External links== *The Society's Official Website *The Constitution at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln *The Constitution at the University of California San Diego Category:Organizations established in 1810 Category:Civil crime prevention Category:History of Dedham, Massachusetts Category:1810 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves"},{"id":"7776573","text":"Theodore Thomson Flynn (11 October 1883 - 23 October 1968) was an Australian marine biologist and a professor in both Tasmania and the United Kingdom.

It has a roll of approximately 800 pupils. The Headmistress is Nicola MacGlashan who joined the school in August 2014. In 2012, it was ranked the 7th best state school in Scotland by the percentage of fifth years attaining at least five Higher passes. == Previous building and fire == The original building, completed in 1962, was partially destroyed in a large fire in 1975. It caused many pupils to be transferred to other schools while the building was demolished and replaced with a newer building. Some pupils were housed in a temporary structure made out of portable units that was reinforced by a brick built super structure at the back of the school grounds - this was built to be a temporary home for the upper school while the new main building was built and was intended to be pulled down once the new part of the school opened, with a maximum life of around 3 years. It was finally demolished in 2005 as part of the extension work, 30 years after it was first built. On the site of this building, called the Westfield Building, is a new large car park.Welcome to The Woodfarm High School December newsletter, Woodfarm High School, 1 December 2012 The original Woodfarm consisted of four separate buildings, one with all general departments including gym, office and management facilities, another with Art and Information Technology departments and the final with English, Maths, Science and Home Economics. The fire destroyed the English and Science departments. The English and Maths building was also named the \\"Westfield Building\\". However, a new wing to the school was opened in 2006, housing the Science, Maths, and English departments, as well as the office and cafeteria. The new 'Street' area is used for in school events such as the school ceilidhs that are held every year in December. Another fire occurred at the new school in 2017, causing damage to the roof.Thornliebank’s Woodfarm High School suffers extensive damage after teenagers set fire to roof, Evening Times, 18 February 2017 == Cluster primary schools == The pupils of Woodfarm High School are mainly made up of students transferring from the three feeder primary schools: Thornliebank Primary School, Braidbar Primary School and Giffnock Primary School. A small percentage of students from primary schools in the Glasgow City Council area are also admitted to the school by placement request. In 2011, Robslee and Giffnock Primary Schools were merged to allow Our Lady of The Missions Roman Catholic Primary the use of the Robslee building.

Macerich owned the property before selling it to Merlone Geier Partners in January 2017. The mall permanently closed on June 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some stores will be allowed to stay open if they provide essential services, including those on the outer perimeter. ==History== Cascade Mall was built in 1989 by Winmar Company. Its original anchor stores were JCPenney, The Bon Marché, Troutman's Emporium, and Sears. Winmar also built an adjacent strip mall called Cross Court, featuring a Target store. The opening of the mall caused many stores to close in nearby Anacortes. The Emporium store later became a second Bon Marché before both Bon Marché stores were re-branded as Macy's. In 2012, mall management removed the food court and replaced it with a TJ Maxx. On October 16, 2014, it was announced that Sears would be closing in January 2015. JCPenney followed suit in 2018. In January 2020, Macy's announced that it would close both of its stores as part of a plan to close 125 stores nationwide, leaving AMC Theatres and TJ Maxx as the only remaining anchor stores left.

Set in a boarding house run by the sensible Mrs. Hoople, it drew humor from the interactions of her grandiose, tall-tale- telling husband, the self-styled Major Hoople, with the rooming-house denizens and his various friends and cronies. After Ahern left NEA in March 1936 to create a similar feature at a rival syndicate, he was succeeded by a number of artists and writers, including Wood Cowan and Bela Zaboly, before Bill Freyse took over as Our Boarding House artist from 1939 to 1969. Others who worked on the strip included Jim Branagan and Tom McCormick. The Sunday color strip ended on March 29, 1981; the weekday panel continued until December 22, 1984. ==Publication history== In 1921, Gene Ahern created the comic strip Crazy Quilt, starring the Nut Brothers, Ches and Wal. That same year, NEA General Manager Frank Rostock suggested to Ahern that he use a boarding house for a setting. Ahern initially used his own experiences as a boarder while a Chicago, Illinois, art student as grist for his comic mill, and featured the picaresque peccadilloes and bickering of its residents, presided over by the no-nonsense Martha Hoople.Horn, Maurice. 100 Years of American Newspaper Comics (Gramercy Books : New York, Avenel, 1996), , .

Hoople, Martha's husband, who'd returned after some long sojourn. \\"Hoople has been compared to the type created on-screen by W. C. Fields, but was probably closer to Falstaff,\\" writes comics historian Maurice Horn. \\"A retired military man of dubious achievement like Shakespeare's [comic figure], he boasted of soldierly exploits that were perhaps not all invented, and his buffoonery sometimes concealed real pathos.\\" That character depth diminished as the comic became more popular, with Major Hoople becoming \\"the one-dimensional figure of fun most people remember\\" of the strip. The primary boarders were the cynical Clyde and Mack, and the only somewhat more trusting Buster. According to comics historian Allan Holtz, a multi-panel Sunday strip was added on December 31, 1922. This Sunday page had a series of topper strips, beginning with Boots and Her Buddies, which ran from September 12, 1926 to October 18, 1931. The next week, Ahern's The Nut Bros began, featuring loony siblings Ches and Wal in pun-filled, vaudevillian bits of business. This ran until June 6, 1965. For some of The Nut Bros' run, there would be an extra panel filled by a series of different titles running in tandem, including: Comic Scrap Book (1932), Silly Snapshots (1932-1933), One in a Million (1934-1945), Mister Blotto (1935-1946), Major Hoople - Jobs I Would Like (1936-1937), Rummy Riddles (1936-1937), Brainwavy (1938-1939), Honks from Otto Auto (1938-1939), Postcard Pests (1938-1940s), Screwy Scenarios (1943), Looney Letters (1943-1944) and Scientific Corner (1946). The panel cartoons mostly disappeared after 1946, although Mister Blotto did return sporadically until 1957.

The Sunday strip came to an end on March 29, 1981, and continued as a daily feature until December 22, 1984, when Carroll and writer Tom McCormick retired.

It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of Palilula. == Location == Slanci is located in the eastern section of the Palilula municipality, from downtown Belgrade and few kilometers east of the neighborhood of Višnjica on the road of Slanački put (Slanci road) which connects Belgrade with Veliko Selo, the easternmost settlement in the municipality of Palilula. The settlement is built on the southern slopes of the hill of Milićevo brdo (279 m), in the micro-valley of the short creek of Vrelski potok. It is surrounded by the Pajstovica, Osovlje and Tapino hills, being tucked in on the southern side of the Danube ridge. == Population == Population of Slanci is stagnating for decades: it had a population of 1,736 in 1991, 1,770 in 2002 and 1,783 in 1991. Serbs made 98% of the population according to the 2002 census. == Characteristics == The name of the settlement, which means \\"salty\\" in Serbian, comes from the many springs in the hills above, many of which have mildly salty water. Using the natural inclination, villagers built a water supply system in the 19th century, when many towns in Serbia had no waterworks. Due to the lack of maintenance, the old aqueduct collapsed in the late 1990s. == Monastery == A monastery of Slanci, dedicated to the Saint archdeacon Stefan, is located nearby. Original building was built in the late 13th century by King Dragutin after he received Belgrade and the northern Serbia from the Hungarian king. The monastery was originally dedicated to Mother of God. The area became part of the Serbian state again in 1403, during the rule of Stefan Lazarević who supported the monastery financially. During the reign of his successor, Đurađ Branković, the monastery was dedicated to the Saint Stephen, the saint protector of the Branković dynasty. The prosperity of the monastery was disrupted after the Ottoman conquest of Serbia in 1459. Ottomans killed 30 students in the monastery but the relics were partially moved to the Vojlovica monastery in then Hungary, across the Danube. In the next five centuries, the monastery was demolished and rebuilt several times. In 1900 a chapel was built on the location of the former monastery. In 1960 patriarch German set the foundation stone for the new monastery which was consecrated in 1967, together with the adjoining konak. The monastery church was finished in 1970. In the vicinity of the monastery is the water spring named after Saint Sava. Since the mid-1970s, the monastery is a metochion of the Hilandar monastery on the Mount Athos. Hilandar bestowed to Slanci a copy of its famed icon of Bogorodica Trojeručica, made in Karyes. The monastery is protected both as the cultural monument and as an archaeological site. == Economy == The settlement is officially classified as rural (village), as agriculture dominate its economy. As a typical representative of an urban agriculture, Slanci was previously known for the production of vegetables for the Balgrade markets. Although there are still some hoop houses, since the late 1990s the production is mostly fruit oriented: cherries, apricots, apples. In recent years, some industrial facilities (warehouses and concrete plants) are developing between Belgrade (Lešće) and Slanci, along the Slanci road. == References == Category:Suburbs of Belgrade Category:Šumadija ","title":"Slanci"},{"id":"7776725","text":"Strathbungo railway station was a railway station serving the village of Strathbungo, Renfrewshire, (and later the city of Glasgow), Scotland.

The Vaca Valley Railroad ran 4.35 miles from Elmira to Vacaville. In June 1869 the line was opened for service.

In 1888 this railroad fell under control of Southern Pacific's subsidiary, the Northern Railway. By 1888, the Northern Railway extended the line northwest from Madison to Capay and Rumsey. In 1898 the line was operated by Southern Pacific (SP) and ran from the Cal-P Oakland-Sacramento mainline at Elmira to Rumsey. SP abandoned the track between Rumsey and Capay in 1934. The track between Rumsey and Esparto was removed in 1937. Passenger service continued between Elmira and Esparto until 1957. The line between Winters and Vacaville, which ran parallel to the west side of Interstate 505, was abandoned in the 1970s, ending at the grocery warehouses just south of Midway Road/I-505 in Vacaville. The Vacaville Branch's last train operated in about 1985 and the line was removed to Elmira by the 1990s. ==Timeline== *July 27, 1868 California Pacific Railroad completes track from Vallejo – Elmira via Suisun.

From the Vacaville/Allendale area, the line crossed Midway Road on the west side of I-505 and ran north to Winters on the east side of Hartley Road. At Udell Road the line ran northbound on the east side of Winters Road. The trestle where the line crossed Putah Creek is on the east side of Winters Road. Present-day Railroad Ave in Winters was the old grade through town and continued north along the east side of Yolo County Road 89. At Madison near Highway 16 the railroad crossed 89 and ran on the east side of Railroad Street where it then turned west along Highway 16 towards Esparto. From there, Highway 16 generally follows the path (albeit with straighter curves) of the old railroad up to Rumsey. The railroad was originally planned to continue up the twisty route to Clearlake, but investment never came through. Each of the train stations still exist, and have been converted into residences (except for the Esparto one). ==References== * * * ==External links== * Pictures of railroad structures on Winters Branch Category:Defunct California railroads Category:Predecessors of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company Category:Railway companies established in 1877 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1888 Category:Vacaville, California Category:Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Solano County, California Category:1877 establishments in California Category:1980s disestablishments in California ","title":"Vaca Valley and Clear Lake Railroad"},{"id":"7776767","text":"Dallas Crutcher Long (born June 13, 1940) is a retired American track and field athlete, who mostly competed in the shot put.

Auberon Herbert, younger son of Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. His mother was Lady Florence, daughter of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. He was educated at Bedford School and Balliol College, Oxford. ==Military and political career== Herbert was a captain in the Hampshire Yeomanry (Carabiniers) and worked as a war correspondent during the Boer War, where he was wounded and lost a leg. His elder brother, Rolf, had died in 1882 and his mother in 1886 and so in 1905 (as the nearest heir) he inherited the barony of Lucas and the lordship of Dingwall (which are able to pass through female lines) from his maternal uncle, the 7th Earl Cowper. However, it was not until 1907 that he was confirmed in the titles by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords and allowed to take his seat in the House of Lords.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

In April 1908 he was appointed to his first ministerial post as Under-Secretary of State for War (with a seat on the Army Council) by H. H. Asquith, a post he held until 1911. He was Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between March and October 1911 and then served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1911 to 1914. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1912 and in August 1914 he entered the cabinet as President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. However, he did not hold office in the coalition government formed by Asquith in May 1915. Lucas also played a prominent part in David Lloyd George's Land Campaign.

It came in the form of APC (aspirin-phenacetin-caffeine) tablets or powder, containing 42% aspirin and 42% phenacetin plus caffeine. Beckers Ltd - outside view of Bex building Bex was a product of Beckers Pty Ltd, originally based at Pym Street, Dudley Park, South Australia, but which relocated to Sydney in the 1960s. It was advertised with the phrase, \\"Stressful Day? What you need is a cup of tea, a Bex and a good lie down\\".. Bex powders, as well as other APC products such as Vincent's, were particularly seen as the housewife's drug of choice in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it became recognised that these medications were addictive, and Priscilla Kincaid-Smith found that the large doses of phenacetin ingested by habitual users were responsible for widespread kidney disease. The phenacetin was removed from Bex in 1975. Bex has also been linked to kidney cancer. ==In popular culture== A Cup of Tea, a Bex and a Good Lie Down was a comedy revue that opened at Sydney's Phillip Street Theatre on 18 September 1965.. It was the longest running show at the theatre in 1966 and was performed over 250 times during its extended run.. The cast included John Ewart, Gloria Dawn, Ruth Cracknell and Reg Livermore. The play was written by John McKellar. The expression \\"A cup of tea, a Bex, and a good lie down\\" had gained currency through much of Australia in the post-World War II period when aspirin became readily available. McKellar's play reinforced the phrase \\"and the title quickly became a common Australian saying\\". It was often abbreviated to \\"go and take a Bex\\" and used in a pejorative sense to indicate to an over-eager person that they should take a more relaxed attitude to a situation. As such, it has had currency in bar room discussions, particularly where someone has become animated in expressing a point of view that is contrary to the general view of the group. In September 2011 former Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, told the media, \\"I just think it would be a good thing if everyone seriously had a cup of tea and a Bex and a long lie down, OK?\\" over reports of his possible challenge to his leader, the incumbent prime minister, Julia Gillard. ==See also== *Vincent Chemical Co., manufacturers of Vincent's APC powders and tablets, a similar formulation ==References== Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Australia Category:Australian English ","title":"Bex (compound analgesic)"},{"id":"7776827","text":"A tambo (Quechua: tampu, \\"inn\\") was an Incan structure built for administrative and military purposes. Found along Incan roads, tambos typically contained supplies, served as lodging for itinerant state personnel,Provincial Power in the Inka Empire. by Terence N. D'Altroy. 1992. Smithsonian Institution. page 101 and were depositories of quipu-based accounting records. Individuals from nearby communities within the Inca empire were conscripted to serve in the tambos, as part of the mit'a labor system. == Characteristics and functions == The Incas built many of their tambos when they began to upgrade the road system during the reign of Thupa Inka Yupanki from 1471 to 1493. Scholars estimate that there were 10,000 or more tambos.D’Altroy, Terence N. The Incas. Blackwell Publishing, 2003, pg. 238. Given this amount, the sheer variety of tambo size and function are hard to fully describe. At a minimum, tambos would contain housing, cooking facilities, and storage silos called qullqas.Suarez and George. (2011) Pg. 40 Beyond this, a considerable amount of variation between different tambos exists. Some tambos were little more than simple inns, while others were essentially cities that provided temporary housing for travelers. Further, there are no clear markers that distinguish larger tambos from villages or small administrative centers. Architecture and documentary evidence suggest that the functional sizes of the settlements probably corresponded to their capacity to house a population.Provincial Power in the Inka Empire. by Terence N. D'Altroy. 1992. Smithsonian Institution. page 98. Qunchamarka tambo on Inca Trail to Machu Picchu The functions of the tambos were dependent on their size as well as the facilities they contained. Every tambo had the capacity to house various state officials. For example, the smallest tambos served as relay stations for the chasquis, who were state messengers who ran along state roads. Larger tambos could provide other functions as well. For example, larger tambos would have larger storehouses that could provide supplies and some lodging for armies on the move.Hyslop, John. The Inka Road System. Academic Press, 1984. Pg. 279. This function should not be allowed to cause confusion between tambos and qullqa, which were only storehouses that armies would resupply from as they passed by.Suarez, Ananda Cohen, and Jeremy James George. Handbook to Life in the Inca World. Facts On File, 2011. Pg. 110 The largest and most luxurious tambos were generally used to lodge the traveling Inca and his entourage (typically wives and state officials). Beyond taking care of various kinds of travelers, larger tambos would also contain facilities where various specialists, such as potters and weavers, would produce their goods. They could also served as administrative centers from which local lords would oversee the region. Furthermore, larger tambos would contain ceremonial spaces which would serve as places for religious practices. Additionally, historians have also found evidence of hunting activity, mining activity, and coca production/exploitation at tambo sites. Pedro Cieza de León made numerous references to the tambos in his Crónicas de Peru; in the following passage, Cieza de León described the general uses for the tambos that he learned from native peoples: > And so there would be adequate supplies for their men, every four leagues > there were lodgings and storehouses, and the representatives or stewards who > lived in the capital of the provinces took great care to see that the > natives kept these inns or lodgings (tambos) well supplied. And so certain > of them would not give more than others, and all should make their > contribution, they kept the accounts by a method of knots, which they call > quipus, and in this way, after the troops had passed by, they could check > and see that there had been no fraud.Cieza de León, Pedro de, The Incas of > Pedro de Cieza de León, translated by Harriet de Onis. Norman, OK: > University of Oklahoma Press, 1959, p. 105 (Chapter LXXXII). == Spacing == Many historians or scholars state that tambos are generally placed a day's walk from each other.Hyslop. (1984). Pg. 297. However, as Hyslop points out, there are many factors, both individual and external, that can affect how much one can walk in a day, making this unreliable as a measure of physical distance. In practice, the distances between tambos vary wildly, ranging from fewer than 10km to nearly 45km.Hyslop. (1984). Pg. 300. Many different factors affected the placement of these tambos. In general, the Inca would try to build them near water and favorable terrain, while they would try to avoid unfavorable terrain (such as marshes or steep slopes).Hyslop. (1984). Pg. 301. In some cases, the Inca would try to build away from local population centers (for reasons unknown), but other times would try to build near local labor sources.Hyslop. (1984). Pg. 301-302. Furthermore, tambos placement may have been influenced by the average speed of llama caravans, which would move more slowly than an individual. Another important traveler that would move more slowly than a typical individual would be the Sapa Inka.Hyslop. (1984). Pg. 303. Since the Sapa Inka would travel with a grand procession, travel would be slower than if he were traveling alone, which would require closer tambo placement. == Architecture == Remains of tambos are scattered throughout modern-day Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia. The remains of the tambos display a large variety of architectural styles. Although this variation is hard to capture in complete detail, some rough categories can be defined. For example, some tambos were built before the Incan empire existed, and the Inca simply took control of them.Hyslop. (1984) Pg. 280 Pre-Incan tambo architecture can be divided into 2 basic categories. Some tambos were not modified in any way and therefore feature an architectural style that is distinctly pre-Incan. However, some of these sites were renovated by the Inca, so some pre-Incan sites do feature some Incan architecture. For the sites built in the Incan period, the architecture styles can be divided into three basic categories. Some tampu were definitively local in their architectural style. This typically happened in places where the local culture was strong and was permitted to continue. Other sites would have mostly Incan architecture, but would have at least some subtle influence from local traditions.Hyslop. (1984). Pg 280-281. Finally, some tambos would contain only Incan style architecture.Hyslop. (1984). Pg. 281. Because of the strong influence local culture tends to have on these structures, Incan style-only tambos tend to exist more in isolated areas as opposed to areas with large populations. The kancha was an architectural feature found in many tambos throughout the Inca empire. The kancha consists of a large structure with rectangular walls, which houses a number of smaller one-room structures within. The decision to build smaller structures within appears to be related to the \\"cold, rainy environment of the Andean highlands.\\" Hyslop notes that kancha were present in Incan structures ranging from the great Qorikancha in Cusco to the smallest, remotest tambo along the Incan roads system. Thus, kancha were not only present in tambos, but were present in a variety of Incan buildings. Historians think that kancha were typically used as living facilities, which reflects the tambos' purpose of housing traveling individuals or groups. == Tambos after the Inca collapse == Scholars such as Craig Morris note that, after the collapse of the Inca empire, the people living within the territory of the former empire ceased to use tambos as they had before. From this, Morris suggests that the tambo system was a part of an \\"artificial urbanism\\" created by the Inca empire. Thus, tambos had been less useful to the people living throughout the Inca empire than they were to the Incas themselves. Morris supports this argument with statements that tambos were frequently positioned for interregional contact and travel, as opposed to being positioned near large local villages. Although indigenous Andeans may have stopped using tambos after the fall of the Inca empire, tambos did not go entirely out of use: Spanish colonizers began to make use of the tambo system. Sometimes the Spaniards used the original Incan tambo structures, but the Spaniards also built new structures along roads. Sometimes the Spaniards would build a new tambo along a road that still had a leftover tambo from the Inca empire. Historians know that the Spanish extended the tambo system beyond what existed throughout the Inca empire, increasing the amount of territory covered. == See also == * Chasqui * Cultural periods of Peru * Peruvian Ancient Cultures * Ollantaytambo * Qullqa ==References== ==Further reading== * Adorno, Rolena. “The Depiction of Self and Other in Colonial Peru.” Art Journal, Summer 1990, Vol. 49 Issue 2, p110-19. * Cieza de León, Pedro de, The Incas of Pedro de Cieza de León, translated by Harriet de Onis.

He smells tasty things, and follows the scent to a log cabin which, unfortunately, is the home of the lumberjack Peg-Leg Pete. While Pete is trying to enjoy lunch, Donald steals all the food off of Pete's table, which makes Pete angry. Pete then hands Donald a stick of dynamite which Donald takes, thinking it is food; it blows up on him. Pete (in a French-Canadian accent) asks Donald whether he wants food. When Donald says \\"Yes\\", Pete throws an axe at Donald, telling him to get to work. The axe is so heavy it pushes Donald into the trunk of a tree. In an attempt to get out of the job, Donald breaks the axe with a stone and shows it to Pete, but Pete simply responds by putting the blade on a piece of wood and hitting it, creating a new handle. Donald ends up swinging the axe so hard it breaks the blade off, which goes over Pete and cuts off part of his pants. Deciding that it is too hard to work with an old-fashioned axe, Donald finds a crosscut saw in a tree trunk and begins using it instead. When the saw gets stuck in the thick bark of the tree and jams, Donald attempts to pull it, but the force pushes Donald backwards and throws him into Pete, knocking both to the ground. Donald ends up inside of Pete's shirt along with the saw, which apparently is partially inside Pete's belly. Donald starts pulling the saw out, tickling Pete. Later however, Pete gets up and angrily chases Donald, threatening to \\"kill you [Donald] to pieces.\\" While running away, the saw suddenly vibrates back and forth. Donald bounces on the ground with the saw and flies over Pete, with the saw's ends hitting Pete in the bottom and pushing his head in the ground. As Pete notices him, Donald chops off a tree branch, causing it to fall on Pete. But Pete quickly gets up and kicks Donald, causing him to get his head stuck between the saw's ends. As Donald tries to free himself, he accidentally chops down a huge tree. The tree collapses and falls on Pete. Furious, Pete roars like a lion with anger and begins chasing Donald. The chase leads Donald and Pete onto a railroad track, where they begin a chase on flatcars. After chasing Donald through a tunnel, Pete tries to grab Donald by the tail, but fails every time, forcing him to pump his flatcar fast enough to bump Donald's rear end. As Donald gets away, Pete resorts to using a peavey to stab Donald. However, he only ends up taking pieces off of Donald's flatcar until it is nothing but wheels. Pete then sharpens the tip of the peavey and increases its temperature by laying it on his flatcar's wheel so that it burns Donald. But the heat only causes Donald to go faster. Donald then jumps off and pulls a lever at a station, triggering a coal storage door. The coal lands right onto Pete and dismantles his flatcar, leaving him cycling on one wheel. Now fleeing on foot, Donald outruns Pete and, in the nick of time, pulls a lever which turns the track the other way, causing Pete to veer off course and crash through a row of boxcars. Satisfied, Donald says farewell to Pete through the boxcar hole, and walks off into the sunset, singing \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\\". ==Voice actors== * Donald Duck: Clarence Nash * Pete: Billy Bletcher ==References*More Information Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:American films Category:1941 films Category:Donald Duck short films Category:1941 animated films Category:Films directed by Jack King Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace ","title":"Timber (1941 film)"},{"id":"7776837","text":"Maurice James Lukefahr, a pioneer researcher in the fields of host plant resistance and environmental control of cotton insect pests, died in Elsa, Texas in 2002.Burke HR, Adkisson PL, Martin DF.

American Entomologist 2003; 49(4):253-254. http://www.entsoc.org/PDF/Pubs/Periodicals/AE/AE-2003/winter/Obit.pdf His graduate research centered on control of the immature stages of the boll weevil and pink bollworm, two economically important insect pests of cultivated cotton. ==Host Plant Resistance== In 1953, Lukefahr began a long career as a research scientist with the Agriculture Research Service, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. Based primarily at the Brownsville, Texas cotton research station, in 1956 he was the first researcher to identify an alternative host of the boll weevil: Thespesia populnea, an ornamental plant popular in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.Lukefahr MJ, A New Host of the Boll Weevil. Journal of Economic Entomology 1956, 49(6):877-878 He subsequently identified several other alternative host plants (including the weevil's likely original host) that have proved critical to the understanding of boll weevil ecology. These discoveries helped to explain the failure of subsequent large-scale, expensive and environmentally damaging eradication campaigns in the US and elsewhere. Lukefahr also showed in 1957 that the pink bollworm enters diapause in response to the shortened day lengths of early fall. These findings were used to improve an existing control program based on early harvest and mandatory areawide stalk destruction. In 1969 he received a Rockefeller Foundation grant to develop strains of cotton that were naturally resistant to insect pests, that could be grown in developing countries without the extensive use of costly, environmentally damaging synthetic pesticides. He developed several such varieties that contained very high levels of gossypol (a natural insect toxin) and that manifested physical features (such as glabrous leaf and stem surfaces) that decreased their suitability for insect egg deposition. ==Other accomplishments== In 1979 Lukefahr retired from the USDA and for the next 13 years worked in Nigeria, Brazil, and Niger under the auspices of various United Nations-affiliated agencies. His research focused on developing strains of cowpea, millet, sorghum, and tropical bean with improved genetic and environmental host plant resistance to insect pests. While in Brazil he contributed to the development of a pest management program for the newly introduced boll weevil, which had devastated cotton production in that country. From 1992 until his death in 2002 he worked as senior research scientist and Research Scientist Emeritus at Rio Farms in Monte Alto, Texas, a research and demonstration farm in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. At Rio Farms he investigated alternative crops for local farmers, such as grape, blackberry, and tropical bean, that might reduce dependence on large-scale, water- and chemical- intensive row crops. Lukefahr authored or co-authored over 400 peer-reviewed publications as well as several books and monographs. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from Greeley County, Nebraska Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Texas A&M; University–Kingsville alumni Category:American entomologists Category:American expatriates in Nigeria Category:American expatriates in Brazil Category:American expatriates in Niger Category:People from Bay City, Texas Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Maurice Lukefahr"},{"id":"7776843","text":"Read Yourself RAW is a comic anthology collecting the non-Maus contents of the first three issues of the magazine RAW, edited by Art Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly and published in October 1987 by Pantheon Books. == Origin == The contents of Read Yourself Raw are a selection of comics by various artists originally published from Raw magazine issues one to three, a comics anthology that circulated from 1980 to 1991. Read Yourself Raw is a selection of comic works that was originally published in issues one to three of Raw. It also includes the original covers, illustrations, and reprints of the inserts that were in those issues. Read Yourself Raw gives readers a taste of some of Raw's contents. == Contents == Read Yourself Raw omits Maus from its collection. Instead, it strictly desires to showcase the comic works from artists, and international artists who deserve to receive more attention and larger readership in the United States. Since Raw is out of print and had a limited run, the original issues are rare. Read Yourself Raw became the only way to get a rerelease of some of the works published from Raw issues one to three because there were no reprintings and these older issues were often resold at a marked-up price. One unique characteristic of both Read Yourself Raw and Raw is that it is difficult even for the editor himself, Art Spiegelman, to define the magazine and who its intended audience is for. He says in Read Yourself Raw: And Francoise Mouly defines her editorial decisions for Raw as: As a reader flips through the pages, they are exposed to design and art that set itself apart from other comics and magazines published during the 1980s. From the outset, both Raw and Read Yourself Raw stand out on the newsstand or bookshelves. Both book’s oversized format is printed on intricate, die-cut covers of which some were hand-ripped and re-tape that speaks to its high production values, and attention to detail. Read Yourself Raw also includes recreations of the bubble-gum cards was stapled into the original issues. These many handmade interventions and special inserts characterizes Mouly’s intention to challenge “the prejudice against comics as toilet literature, that they should be printed only on newsprint and disposable.” Instead, both Raw and Read Yourself Raw promote the idea of comics being a unique, collectible product. Spigelman and Mouly published the innovative comic works that explored new ground through experimentation, self-expression, and artistic exploration in a striking avant-garde, messy, and neoexpressionist comic styles in both art and story. == Styles and Influence == Readers will see in Read Yourself Raw the complexities found in the tension between the art and the drawings that calls for mature readers and to be taken seriously. As a result, comics published in Read Yourself Raw challenges the notion that comics’ intended audience only as one for children. Read Yourself Raw and, in broader context, Raw were seminal works that helped to define the age of alternative comics in the 1980s. As a formative work, studying the comics and graphic work published in Read Yourself Raw allows for a closer study of the cultural phenomenon that was alternative comics. Manhattan, by Jacques Tardi, is one of the comics in Read Yourself Raw that is a key example of the striking contrast to the mainstream superhero comics prevalent during this decade. Manhattan premiered in the first issue of Raw, with Tardi’s work being exposed to American readers for the first time. The visual style is completely drawn in high black and white contrast, and explores mature and darker themes that differs from the four colour CYMK that is distinctive of superhero comics. Overall, the story was “instrumental in defining both that magazine’s virtuoso aesthetic and its dark sensibility.” The story follows a male protagonist’s depressing and dark metacognitions as he walks through the streets of Manhattan, New York City by himself. At the end, readers are left contemplating over whether he committed suicide as the panels pan away the city’s skyline, trying to make sense of his actions in juxtaposition to his thoughts. These types of autobiographical, and emotionally realistic comics were just beginning to emerge to the comic book scene and only made possible by innovative publications like Read Yourself Raw. The cultural significance of Read Yourself Raw in juxtaposition to the mainstream comic book industry is its role in the trajectory of the countercultural comix movement, and the diversification of comic book styles. Readers will see in Read Yourself Raw the complexities found in the tension between the art and the drawings that calls for mature readers and to be taken seriously. As a result, comics published in Read Yourself Raw challenges the notion that comics’ intended audience only as one for children. == References == Category:Pantheon Books comics titles ","title":"Read Yourself Raw"},{"id":"7776845","text":"Elati (, meaning \\"pine tree\\") is a mountain on the Greek island of Lefkada.

The original Japanese version was published by Bandai at the end of 2004, after merging with Namco but before the formation of Namco Bandai Games. The subsequent international releases and the GameCube versions were published under Namco Bandai Games. The game is based on the Zatch Bell! franchise. ==Plot== Every 1,000 years, 100 mamodo children are sent to earth. Each mamodo child comes with a spellbook, which will unleash strong powers when read by a human partner. The mamodo and human will then battle other mamodo for the title of the next \\"Mamodo King\\". If the spellbook is destroyed in battle, a mamodo will lose all chance of becoming King, and will return to the Mamodo World forever. The last one standing without their book burned will be crowned the King. Kiyo Takamine is a 14-year-old Japanese boy genius who is bullied at school for his intellect. As a result, he is socially inept and has trouble making friends. Concerned, Kiyo's father, a professor teaching in England sends a young boy named Zatch Bell to help him. Kiyo's father found Zatch dying in a nearby forest, where he had lost all of his memory except for his name, and also with the young boy, a mysterious book. It is soon discovered that Zatch is one of the mamodo competing for King, and after seeing a kindhearted mamodo named Kolulu fight against her will, he vows to become a benevolent Mamodo King and stop the fighting. A few months later, the number of mamodo left on earth is down to 40 as an evil mamodo named Zofis rises. He had recently discovered that many mamodo from the previous battle a millennia ago were turned to stone along with their spellbooks by the legendary Goren of the Stone, also from the previous battle. Zofis revives the Ancient Mamodo with he mysterious \\"stone of moonlight\\" and brainwashes humans into reading their spellbooks, creating a whole new army of minions, planned to be sent out to defeat the remaining mamodo in order to become King. Zatch and Kiyo learn about his plan and battle their way through his army and finally confront Zofis. Right after Zofis is sent back to the Mamodo World by the once again victorious Zatch Bell, a mysterious figure appears. The figure is a mamodo child who looks like Zatch, named Zeno, who claims to hate Zatch more than anything. The doppelgänger and his partner, Dufort prove to be tough for Kiyo and Zatch, and finally, Zeno declares that he will leave them alone for now, stating that he wants Zatch to \\"suffer\\" another \\"living nightmare\\" before finally defeating him. Zeno and Dufort leave, and although Zatch is initially worried about the \\"nightmare\\" his lookalike mentioned, Kiyo encourages him to become strong and that they will never give up. Zatch agrees, and the two proceed on, prepared for another adventure. ==Game modes== Story Mode: Play is done over the course of 40 levels consisting of different opponents. Often special conditions will need to be met, such as defeating an opponent with Bao Zakeruga. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the opponent be at minimum health. In addition to the regular Story Mode there is a series of mini games which are consolidated into \\"Zatch's Diary\\". These follow every day situations in Zatch's life. Previously played levels can be reselected either to improve rating or on higher difficulties. Arcade Mode: Choose a character and fight against eight opponents. Once completed, a special cut-scene for the chosen character will play that contains dialogue between the mamodo and his or her partner. After the scene concludes you will see the statistics of all eight matches. These statistics determine the chance of the mamodo becoming King. To receive a 100% rating, all matches must be won with an \\"A\\" rating. VS. Mode: This is a traditional one-on-one battle. Choose any character and stage and begin fighting immediately. Play can either be against CPU opponents or other people via two controllers. A ranking up system is also available. Stats for individual characters can be upgraded by the obtaining of \\"Mamodo Points\\", which are distributed after the conclusion of a match. The number of points given is based on the aforementioned ranking system, with \\"A\\" being the best and \\"E\\" being the worst. 4P Battle: Meant as more of a party mode, the 4P battles are in the form of mini games. These include \\"Burn the Spell Book\\", which has each player try to kick another's spell book into a small campfire, among others. Mini-Games: This game mode contains seven mini games where certain goals must be completed. One level requires you to find 30 lollipops and give them to Kanchome within 80 seconds. Gallery: The Gallery is split into several subtypes: the Model Gallery, which shows all the character models used in the game along with a short description of each; Visual Gallery, which has all the cut scenes from the Story Mode; Stage Gallery, which lets the player control Suzy Mizuno and roam freely along the multiplayer stages; and the Sound Gallery, which contains all the music from the game. ==Changes to the US version== HUD from the Japanese to the U.S. version. *There are a few cosmetic changes to the HUD. The icons of the mamodo in the English version are removed, the indicators merely showing the character names instead. Also, in Story Mode of the Japanese version, character reactions are visible in both up-right and down-left corners of the screen while battling. However, in the U.S. version, they don't appear, although some of the dialogue remains. *Certain story mode levels have been given different objectives. Near the end of the United States version, the player is usually given different objectives besides fighting, such as knocking out the opponent's spell book, trying to survive until the time runs out, etc. In the Japanese version, the player is to just fight them instead. *The two versions also have graphical differences. The character models are given thick outlinings and slightly brighter coloration in the Japanese version. There are also few differences on how certain spells look, although they are minor differences. Minor differences can also be seen on certain characters' strongest spells, usually graphical differences, but sometimes audio differences as well. *The voices in the Japanese version are of much higher sound quality. The United States version's voices are quite low quality and sound grainy. *The lip syncing does not match the character's voices in the United States version. While the voices were replaced, the lip syncing was not changed whatsoever in the United States port, which is why it's inaccurate. *The Japanese version has three exclusive songs (Intro song, credits song, and one of the battle themes). The United States version replaces two of them with its own exclusive songs (The intro song and credits song), however, the said exclusive battle theme song is replaced with an already existing song. The one missing song can be heard in the \\"Meadows\\" stage of the Japanese version. Strangely enough, the missing song was put back in on the GameCube port. The Japanese version seems to also have the United States version's credits songs within the game's files, although it is left unused and can only be heard in the Audio Gallery (The Audio Gallery is an unlockable feature where you can listen to the game's soundtrack) *The Japanese version has a few moments where certain characters say lines that don't seem to be in the United States version (Ex: Zatch yelling \\"No!\\" at the end of the first battle against Robnos). One of these lines, though, were added back in the GameCube port (The line where Zatch yells \\"No!\\" at the battle against Robnos). *The battle against Victoream is much more difficult in the United States version. Victoream has two times more defense in the United States version as opposed to the Japanese version. Victoream's battle is the only battle to have a character's stats modified between the two versions. Victoream's Artificial intelligence also seems to be slightly different in the Japanese version, as it uses a larger variety of spells. ==Differences between the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions== Since both the PlayStation 2 & GameCube have different graphic rendering, there are many differences between the lighting, rendering and textures on both versions. Typically, spells are slightly more detailed in the GameCube version, notably Hyde's Jikiga and Brago's Gigano Reis. *In the GameCube version, the stage \\"Front of Windmill\\" has a black background instead of a sky background. This might be because the sky texture on that stage was either corrupted in translation or missing. *The frame-rate in the GameCube version sometimes drops, usually when you and/or the camera is too close to the spell's graphics. It also happens on 2P mode in the stage \\"Roof of Abandoned Building\\". It happens if you just stand at your starting position, and the camera is pointing not only at the back of you, but inside the outside scenery as well. *The GameCube version has one extra song added to the game, which is notably used in the \\"Meadows\\" stage. In the PlayStation 2 version, the song used in the Schoolyard stage is used instead. *More sound effects used to indicate damage is added in the GameCube version. *Certain damage sound effects are noticeably louder in the GameCube version. *Certain characters' spells have sound effects that are in the PlayStation 2 version, but don't appear to be in the GameCube, and vice versa. *In the \\"Meadows\\" stage, occasionally a tree branch will fly out. This function seems to happen more often in the GameCube than the PlayStation 2 version. ==Reception== ==References== ==External links== * Japanese Website Category:Zatch Bell! video games Category:Versus fighting games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:2004 video games Category:GameCube games Category:Cartoon Network video games ","title":"Zatch Bell!

It serves a purpose similar to the parallel random access machine (PRAM) model. BSP differs from PRAM by not taking communication and synchronization for granted. An important part of analyzing a BSP algorithm rests on quantifying the synchronization and communication needed. ==History== The BSP model was developed by Leslie Valiant of Harvard University during the 1980s. The definitive articleLeslie G. Valiant, A bridging model for parallel computation, Communications of the ACM, Volume 33 Issue 8, Aug. 1990 was published in 1990. Between 1990 and 1992, Leslie Valiant and Bill McColl of Oxford University worked on ideas for a distributed memory BSP programming model, in Princeton and at Harvard. Between 1992 and 1997, McColl led a large research team at Oxford that developed various BSP programming libraries, languages and tools, and also numerous massively parallel BSP algorithms. With interest and momentum growing, McColl then led a group from Oxford, Harvard, Florida, Princeton, Bell Labs, Columbia and Utrecht that developed and published the BSPlib Standard for BSP programming in 1996. Valiant developed an extension to the BSP model in the 2000s, leading to the publication of the Multi-BSP modelValiant, L. G. (2011). A bridging model for multi-core computing. Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 77(1), 154-166 in 2011. In 2017, McColl developed a major new extension of the BSP model that provides fault tolerance and tail tolerance for large-scale parallel computations in AI, Analytics and HPC. A Bridging Model for High Performance Cloud Computing by Bill McColl in 18th SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (2018), http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=88973 . ==The model== A BSP computer consists of # components capable of processing and/or local memory transactions (i.e., processors), # a network that routes messages between pairs of such components, and # a hardware facility that allows for the synchronisation of all or a subset of components. This is commonly interpreted as a set of processors which may follow different threads of computation, with each processor equipped with fast local memory and interconnected by a communication network. A BSP algorithm relies heavily on the third feature; a computation proceeds in a series of global supersteps, which consists of three components: * Concurrent computation: every participating processor may perform local computations, i.e., each process can only make use of values stored in the local fast memory of the processor. The computations occur asynchronously of all the others but may overlap with communication. * Communication: The processes exchange data between themselves to facilitate remote data storage capabilities. * Barrier synchronisation: When a process reaches this point (the barrier), it waits until all other processes have reached the same barrier. The computation and communication actions do not have to be ordered in time. Communication typically takes the form of the one- sided put and get Direct Remote Memory Access (DRMA) calls, rather than paired two-sided send and receive message passing calls. The barrier synchronization concludes the superstep: it ensures that all one-sided communications are properly concluded. Systems based on two-sided communication include this synchronisation cost implicitly for every message sent. The method for barrier synchronisation relies on the hardware facility of the BSP computer. In Valiant's original paper, this facility periodically checks if the end of the current superstep is reached globally. The period of this check is denoted by L. The figure below shows this in a diagrammatic form. The processes are not regarded as having a particular linear order (from left to right or otherwise), and may be mapped to processors in any way. 400px The BSP model is also well-suited to enable automatic memory management for distributed-memory computing through overdecomposition of the problem and oversubscription of the processors. The computation is divided into more logical processes than there are physical processors, and processes are randomly assigned to processors. This strategy can be shown statistically to lead to almost perfect load balancing, both of work and communication. ==Communication== In many parallel programming systems, communications are considered at the level of individual actions: sending and receiving a message, memory to memory transfer, etc. This is difficult to work with since there are many simultaneous communication actions in a parallel program, and their interactions are typically complex. In particular, it is difficult to say much about the time any single communication action will take to complete. The BSP model considers communication actions en masse. This has the effect that an upper bound on the time taken to communicate a set of data can be given. BSP considers all communication actions of a superstep as one unit, and assumes all individual messages sent as part of this unit have a fixed size. The maximum number of incoming or outgoing messages for a superstep is denoted by h. The ability of a communication network to deliver data is captured by a parameter g, defined such that it takes time hg for a processor to deliver h messages of size 1. A message of length m obviously takes longer to send than a message of size 1. However, the BSP model does not make a distinction between a message length of m or m messages of length 1. In either case the cost is said to be mg. The parameter g is dependent on the following factors: * The protocols used to interact within the communication network. * Buffer management by both the processors and the communication network. * The routing strategy used in the network. * The BSP runtime system. In practice, g is determined empirically for each parallel computer. Note that g is not the normalised single-word delivery time, but the single-word delivery time under continuous traffic conditions. ==Barriers== The one-sided communication of the BSP model requires barrier synchronization. Barriers are potentially costly, but avoid the possibility of deadlock or livelock, since barriers cannot create circular data dependencies. Tools to detect them and deal with them are unnecessary. Barriers also permit novel forms of fault tolerance. The cost of barrier synchronization is influenced by a couple of issues: # The cost imposed by the variation in the completion time of the participating concurrent computations. Take the example where all but one of the processes have completed their work for this superstep, and are waiting for the last process, which still has a lot of work to complete. The best that an implementation can do is ensure that each process works on roughly the same problem size. # The cost of reaching a globally consistent state in all of the processors. This depends on the communication network, but also on whether there is special-purpose hardware available for synchronizing, and on the way in which interrupts are handled by processors. The cost of a barrier synchronization is denoted by l. Note that l if the synchronisation mechanism of the BSP computer is as suggested by Valiant. In practice, a value of l is determined empirically. On large computers barriers are expensive, and this is increasingly so on large scales. There is a large body of literature on removing synchronization points from existing algorithms, both in the context of BSP computing and beyond. For example, many algorithms allow for the local detection of the global end of a superstep simply by comparing local information to the number of messages already received. This drives the cost of a global synchronisation, compared to the minimally required latency of communication, to zero.Alpert, R., & Philbin, J. (1997). cBSP: Zero-cost synchronization in a modified BSP model. NEC Research Institute, 4 Independence Way, Princeton NJ, 8540, . Yet also this minimal latency is expected to increase further for future supercomputer architectures and network interconnects; the BSP model, along with other models for parallel computation, require adaptation to cope with this trend. Multi-BSP is one BSP-based solution. ==The cost of a BSP algorithm== The cost of a superstep is determined as the sum of three terms; the cost of the longest running local computation, the cost of global communication between the processors, and the cost of the barrier synchronisation at the end of the superstep. The cost of one superstep for p processors: max_{i = 1}^{p}(w_i) + max_{i=1}^{p}(h_i g) + l where w_i is the cost for the local computation in process i, and h_i is the number of messages sent or received by process i. Note that homogeneous processors are assumed here. It is more common for the expression to be written as w + hg + l where w and h are maxima. The cost of the algorithm then, is the sum of the costs of each superstep. W + Hg + Sl = \\\\sum_{s=1}^{S}w_s + g \\\\sum_{s=1}^{S}h_s + Sl where S is the number of supersteps. W, H, and S are usually modelled as functions, that vary with problem size. These three characteristics of a BSP algorithm are usually described in terms of asymptotic notation, e.g. H \\\\in O(n/p). ==Extensions and uses== Interest in BSP has soared in recent years, with Google adopting it as a major technology for graph analytics at massive scale via technologies like Pregel and MapReduce. Also, with the next generation of Hadoop decoupling the MapReduce model from the rest of the Hadoop infrastructure, there are now active open source projects to add explicit BSP programming, as well as other high performance parallel programming models, on top of Hadoop. Examples are Apache HamaApache Hama and Apache Giraph. BSP has been extended by many authors to address concerns about BSP's unsuitability for modelling specific architectures or computational paradigms. One example of this is the decomposable BSP model. The model has also been used in the creation of a number of new programming languages and interfaces, such as Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML (BSML), BSPLib,BSPlib Apache Hama, and Pregel.Pregel Notable implementations of the BSPLib standard are the Paderborn University BSP libraryThe Paderborn University BSP (PUB) Library - Design, Implementation and Performance Heinz Nixdorf Institute, Departement of Computer Science, University of Paderborn, Germany, technical report . and the Oxford BSP Toolset by Jonathan Hill.Jonathan Hill: The Oxford BSP Toolset, 1998.

The southern terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 39 in Forestville. Its northern terminus was at a junction with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Silver Creek. The route passed through mostly rural areas and crossed over the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) without connecting to the highway. NY 428 was assigned and removed in 1980 after ownership and maintenance of the highway was transferred from the state of New York to Chautauqua County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Although the swap took effect on April 1, the NY 428 designation was not removed until September 9\\\\. The former routing of NY 428 is now the northernmost section of County Route 85 (CR 85). ==Route description== CR 85 in June 2015 heading away from US 20 in Silver Creek NY 428 began at an intersection with NY 39 and CR 87 in Forestville. It headed north through the village on Center Street, passing by several blocks of homes and intersecting CR 89 before it exited Forestville. Outside of Forestville in Hanover, NY 428 continued northward as Bennett State Road through farmland, paralleling both CR 89 and Walnut Creek to the hamlet of Keaches Corners, where it met CR 84. The highway continued onward through open fields, intersecting CR 86 just before passing over the New York State Thruway (I-90). Past the Thruway, NY 428 continued north along Silver Creek into the village of Silver Creek, where it became known as Division Street at the village line. It followed Division Street for two blocks through a lightly populated area before turning west onto Burgess Street for another two blocks through a more densely populated portion of the community. NY 428 ended at an intersection with US 20 south of the village center. ==History== Former reference marker for NY 428 in Hanover NY 428 was assigned to a previously unnumbered roadway between Forestville and Silver Creek. The route remained intact until 1980 when the roadway was given to Chautauqua County as part of a large-scale maintenance swap of routes within the county. Under the terms of the deal, NY 428 was transferred to the county along with NY 424, the segment of NY 380 between NY 424 and US 20, and two reference routes in the vicinity of Dunkirk and Fredonia. In exchange, NYSDOT assumed control over NY 394 between US 20 and NY 5 in Westfield, US 62 from NY 60 to NY 394 east of Jamestown, and Forest Avenue (unsigned reference route NY 952P) from the Pennsylvania state line in Busti to NY 60 in Jamestown.

The utility of atpB gene sequences in resolving phylogenetic relationships: comparison with rbcL and 18S ribosomal DNA sequences in the Lardizabalaceae. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 194-207 native to temperate forests of central and southern Chile and Argentina. The sole species is Boquila trifoliolata (DC.) Decne., known as pilpil, voqui, voquicillo, voquillo, voqui blanco in Chile. It grows vines that wrap around host plants, mimicking the host’s leaves in a phenomenon called mimetic polymorphism. It bears an edible fruit (Boquila berries). This species has been shown to be capable of mimicking the leaves of its supporting trees. Ernesto Gianoli said \\"Boquila’s leaves are extraordinarily diverse. The biggest ones can be 10 times bigger than the smallest, and they can vary from very light to very dark. In around three- quarters of cases, they’re similar to the closest leaf from another tree, matching it in size, area, length of stalk, angle, and color. Boquila’s leaves can even grow a spiny tip when, and only when, it climbs onto a shrub with spine-tipped leaves.\\" Without any nearby host leaves to influence them, the normal leaves of the B. Trifoliolata are relatively short and light green leaves with rounded edges. The Boquila, unlike other plants capable of mimicry, does not require physical contact to match its host. ==Mimicry== Boquila trifoliolata is a unique species of plant because of its ability to mimic its leaves to the leaves of the hosts that are supporting them, a phenomenon called mimetic polymorphism. The B. trifoliolata adapted their climbing behavior to be protected from ground herbivores and the mimicry behavior as a protection against leaf herbivores. B. trifoliolata is distinct in comparison to other plants that can mimic, like the Australian Mistletoe, because it is not limited to mimicking a single host and also is not a parasite to the host tree. An individual B. trifoliolata vine can mimic multiple foliage closest in proximity to it. Their mimicking behavior was discovered by researchers Ernesto Gianoli and Fernando Carrasco-Urra. They carried out observations and measurements in a rainforest located at Puyehue National Park in southern Chile. They sampled 12 different species of host trees with 45 total individual B. trifoliolata vines that had climbed these trees. The two closest leaves in proximity between a pair of the 45 vine-trees were measured, 11 different traits in total: angle, thickness, petiole length, leaflet petiole length, leaflet angle, maximum width, maximum length, area, perimeter, area/perimeter, and color. Usage of a generalized linear model showed that 9 of the 11 traits demonstrated mimicry by the vine to its host tree. Gianoli et al. also sampled more individuals that were prostrated, that grew on leafless tree trunks, and more individuals that have climbed on the 8 most common host species. To analyze these samples, the researchers used multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). They found that the prostrate individuals were not different from the leafless-host vines, but that they were different for 7 of the 8 common-host vine leaves. They also concluded that the leafless-host vines were different for 6 of the 8 common-host vines. Currently, there is no known mechanism for how B. trifoliolata is able to mimic host leaves so well, but Gianoli proposes two possible mechanisms. One hypothesis is that volatile organic compounds emitted from host plant leaves induce a phenotypic change in closeby B. trifoliolata leaves. By receiving different host signals into its system, it is able to create specific signals and hormones in its tissues to regulate gene transcription of leaf morphology and developmental pathways for leaf differentiation. The other hypothesis is that there could be horizontal gene transfer between the host and B. trifoliolata. A study also by Gianoli et al. indicated that this leaf mimicry led to lower leaf herbivory rates. Climbing vines had no difference in herbivory compared to supporting host tree leaves but had much lower herbivory compared to prostrated, unsupported B. trifoliolata individuals. The highest amount of herbivory was on B. trifoliolata vines that climbed onto leafless hosts. ==See also== * Lardizabala, a related species also grown for its fruit ==References== Category:Lardizabalaceae Category:Flora of Chile Category:Monotypic Ranunculales genera ","title":"Boquila"},{"id":"7777062","text":"\\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" on the Tempo label (US), recorded by Brother Bones and His Shadows Freeman Davis (October 4, 1902 – June 14, 1974Thedeadrockstrasclub.com - accessed January 2010) was an American whistling and bone playing recording artist best known by his stage name Brother Bones as well as \\"Whistling Sam\\". ==Early life== Freeman Davis was born in Montgomery, Alabama. ==Career== Davis is best remembered for his 1949 recording of the 1925 standard \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\".

Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 23 approximately south of Downtown Columbus and just outside the city limits; its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 62 in Gahanna. The route serves as a partial southeastern outbelt for the Columbus metropolitan area, passing through many commercial districts and light industry areas. SR 317 was established in the early 1930s. The highway was extended three times, the first in the early 1960s, to US 33\\\\. The second time the route was in the early 1970s and it was extended south to Groveport. The final time the route was extended was in the mid-1970s and the route was extended to US 23\\\\. ==Route description== SR 317 begins at an intersection with US 23\\\\. This intersection is also the eastern terminus of SR 665, on the west side of US 23\\\\. SR 317 heads east as a two-lane, passing through farmland and woodland. The highway passes over a CSX and a Norfolk Southern railroad tracks. After the railroad tracks, the route passes through light industry properties. The road has an intersection with Alum Creek Drive, this intersection provides access to Rickenbacker International Airport. Here, SR 317 has its lowest traffic counts; within the 2011 ODOT survey, the road is listed with an average annual daily traffic (AADT) of 6,930 vehicles on a section of highway between Alum Creek Drive and Groveport Road. The road curves northeast, before curving due north. The highway heads through the west side of Groveport. In Groveport, the road has becomes a four-lane divided highway. The route leaves Groveport heading north, still passing through industrial properties, with some commercial properties. The highway enters Columbus city limits and has an interchange with US 33\\\\. After US 33, the highway becomes a four-lane undivided roadway, passing through residential properties. The highway leaves Columbus and reenters the city, before passing under Interstate 270 (I–270). After passing under I–270, SR 317 passes the Eastland Mall, on the west side of the road. The road continues north passes through commercial properties, having an interchange with I–70. SR 317 continues north and enters Whitehall. The route passes through residential properties, before passing through commercial properties. The highway has an intersections with both US 40 and SR 16 in Whitehall. The road leaves Whitehall and reenters Columbus, by passing under Columbus and Ohio River Railroad tracks. After passing under the railroad tracks, SR 317 passes to the east of Port Columbus International Airport. The road has an interchange with I–270, at the northeast corner of the airport. North of I–270, SR 317 leaves Columbus for the final time and it enters Gahanna. Between I–270 and Rocky Fork Boulevard, SR 317 has its highest AADT at 36,870 vehicles. The highway continues north passing through residential, on the west side of the road, and commercial properties, on the east side of the road. The highway makes a sharp curve, turning due west, and passes through commercial properties. SR 317 end at a T-intersection with US 62 in Gahanna, SR 317 enters the intersection from the east and US 62 enters from the west and north. The highway is not incorporated within the National Highway System. ==History== SR 317 was original route certified in 1932. The original route was from SR 16 in Whitehall to Gahanna. In 1936, the section of SR 317 between US 23 and Groveport, was commissioned as SR 665. Between 1959 and 1962, SR 317 was extended south to US 33 along previously unnumbered road.

Born in Cardiganshire, Lloyd entered Oriel College, Oxford in 1607, graduating with a BA in 1611 and an MA in 1614. He is said to have become a Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford in 1614, but the college's records do not list him as ever being a fellow. Lloyd obtained further degrees of BD in 1624 and DD in 1638, as a member of Jesus College. He was appointed to the livings of St Andrews, Dinas Powis, Glamorgan (1617) and St Nicholas in the same county in 1626, later being given the sinecure position of rector of Denbigh in 1637 and given the living of Hirnant, Montgomeryshire, in 1638. He became Canon and Archdeacon of St David's in 1644. During the English Civil War, he was a marked Royalist and lost his position as Archdeacon and also his parish livings. He was taken prisoner for three weeks by Colonel Thomas Horton after the Battle of St Fagans in May 1648. Orders were given for his arrest on 9 February 1651 and in 1652 some property of his, in Herefordshire, was forfeited for treason (although he successfully fought against this and possession was restored to him in 1652). On the Restoration, he was appointed Bishop of Llandaff (17 October 1660) and was reappointed to his previous parishes and his Archdeaconry. He was also made rector of Llangattock in Brecknockshire. He supported free schools (described Glamorgan in a A Letter to the Clergy for the support of the Free Schools as \\"utterly destitute of schools\\") and took an active interest in the diocese of Llandaff. However, his work left little mark. He was buried in Llandaff Cathedral. A natural outcrop of rock at St. Andrew's Major served for his meditations and bears his name. ==References== Category:1580s births Category:1667 deaths Category:People from Ceredigion Category:Alumni of Oriel College, Oxford Category:Fellows of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Archdeacons of St David's Category:Bishops of Llandaff Category:17th-century Welsh Anglican priests Category:Cavaliers Category:Burials at Llandaff Cathedral Category:17th-century Anglican bishops ","title":"Hugh Lloyd (bishop)"},{"id":"7777141","text":"Stambermill Viaduct Stambermill Viaduct is a viaduct situated in Stourbridge, West Midlands, England.

It is still in use for goods trains, as the railway continues on to the Round Oak Steel Terminal at Brierley Hill (trains have not travelled beyond that point since 1993). Freight trains can still be seen passing over the viaduct. A reopening of the South Staffordshire Line between Dudley and Walsall, is expected to be ready by 2023, with West Midlands Metro trams sharing the line with freight trains. A business plan for the reopening of the line was submitted to Network Rail in March 2011. In January 2012, plans surfaced to run a passenger service between Stourbridge Junction and Brierley Hill, with stations being re-opened along the route, including Brierley Hill. The service would be operated by railcars built by Parry People Movers, who built the Class 139 units which run the Stourbridge Town service.

Segal (born 1956 in Lutsk, Ukraine) is a cognitive psychologist, a specialist on depression and one of the founders of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). A professor of psychology at University of Toronto, Segal combines mindfulness with conventional cognitive behavioral therapy, which teaches patients to develop a different relationship to sadness or unhappiness by observing and without judgment. Presently he is Distinguished Professor of Psychology in Mood Disorders in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto Scarborough. He is also the Director of Clinical Training in the Graduate Department of Clinical Psychological Science. ==Career== When he first started working on the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) project, he was studying how depression alters a person's self- image. His research included measuring a depressed patient's self-image by calculating the time it took her to react to positive or negative information about her. David Kupfer, who was head of the Psychobiology of Depression Research Network of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, asked Segal to create a \\"maintenance\\" version of cognitive therapy which could be used to fight depression relapse after one had recovered from an acute episode.Segal, Teasdale, Williams, 2013, p.19-20 This need for a new therapy became Zindel Segal's new passion. He is the author of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression. His research has helped to characterize psychological markers of relapse vulnerability to affective disorder. Among the books he has authored are Interpersonal Process in Cognitive Therapy, Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression, and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: A new approach for preventing relapse. A Founding Fellow of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy, he was awarded the Douglas Utting Prize for significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of depression and the Hope Award by the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario. He continues to advocate for the relevance of mindfulness-based clinical care in psychiatry and mental health. ==Works== * The Self in emotional distress: cognitive and psychodynamic perspectives, by Zindel V.

It was established by military commander and Armenian political thinker Garegin Nzhdeh and his allies with the support of local guerrilla forces, following the suppression of the February Uprising in April 1921. It was not recognized by any country but existed until mid-July of the same year. ==Background== ===Post World War I=== Following World War I, the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, and in the ensuing peace negotiations in Paris, the Allies had vowed to punish the Young Turks and reward some, if not all, of the eastern provinces of the empire to the nascent Armenian Republic.Hovannisian, Richard G. \\"The Allies and Armenia, 1915–18.\\" Journal of Contemporary History. Vol. 3, No. 1 (Jan., 1968), pp. 145–168. However, the Allies were more concerned with concluding the peace treaties with Germany and the other European members of the Central Powers. In matters related to the Near East, the principal western powers, Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States, had conflicting interests over the spheres of influence they were to assume. While there were crippling internal disputes between the Allies, the United States was reluctant to accept a mandate over Armenia. Meanwhile, the recently formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and Turkish National Movement had both set their sights on taking over the Caucasus, including Armenia. The Bolsheviks sympathized with the Turkish Movement due to their mutual opposition to the western powers, or \\"Western Imperialism,\\" as the Bolsheviks referred to it. The Soviet government formed an alliance with the Turkish nationalists and started sending them gold and weapons. This proved disastrous for the Armenians, and eventually Western Armenia fell to the invading forces.Hovannisian, Richard G. \\"Armenia and the Caucasus in the Genesis of the Soviet-Turkish Entente.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 4, No. 2 (April, 1973), pp. 129–147. ===Sovietization of Armenia=== The Soviet 11th Red Army enters Yerevan in 1920, effectively ending Armenian self-rule. Armenia gave way to communist power in late 1920. The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the 29 November 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Nzhdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands. Nzhdeh did not depart from Syunik and continued his struggle against the Red Army and Soviet Azerbaijan. ==Declaration== Garegin Nzhdeh was the leader of anti-Bolshevik resistance. On 18 February 1921, the ARF led an anti- Soviet rebellion in Yerevan and seized power. The ARF controlled Yerevan and the surrounding regions for almost 42 days before being defeated by the numerically superior Red Army troops later in April 1921. The leaders of the rebellion then retreated into the Syunik region. On 26 April 1921, the 2nd Pan-Zangezurian congress, held in Tatev monastery, announced the independence of the self-governing regions of Daralakyaz (Vayots Dzor), Zangezur, and Mountainous Artsakh, under the name of the Republic of Mountainous Armenia and later on 1 June 1921, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia.Mountainous Armenia ==Policies== The city of Goris became the capital of the unrecognized state, and Garegin Nzhdeh was chosen as prime minister and minister of defence. Later, in July, Simon Vratsian took the office as prime minister while Nzhdeh became the governor and the general commander. Nzhdeh actively engaged in expelling the 3/5th Azeri population of Zangezur. Between April and July 1921, the Red Army conducted massive military operations in the region, attacking Syunik from the north and east. After months of fierce battles with the Red Army, the Republic of Mountainous Armenia capitulated in July 1921 following Soviet Russia's promises to keep the mountainous region as a part of Soviet Armenia. After the conflict, Garegin Nzhdeh, his soldiers, and many prominent Armenian intellectuals, including leaders of the first Independent Republic of Armenia, crossed the border into neighboring Persian city of Tabriz. ==See also== * History of Nagorno-Karabakh * List of historical unrecognized states and dependencies ==References== *Հայոց Գաղափարաբանության Հենասյուները from noravank.am *Other Armenian States from freenet.am Category:1921 establishments in Armenia Category:1921 disestablishments in Armenia Category:20th century in Armenia Category:Former republics Category:States and territories established in 1921 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1921 Category:History of the Republic of Artsakh Category:Former unrecognized countries ","title":"Republic of Mountainous Armenia"},{"id":"7777219","text":"Arwyn Davies (born 8 April 1967) is a Welsh actor, best known for playing the character of Mark Jones since 1993 on the long-running Welsh-language soap Pobol y Cwm.

The original viaduct was a wooden structure erected in 1850 to carry the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway over Parkhead Locks on the Dudley Canal, near to the southern mouth of the Dudley Tunnel. The current brick viaduct was built in 1880 and it is believed that the original wooden structure is still encased within its successor. Use of the viaduct had fallen by the late 1960s due to the closure of passenger stations on the route, but the line remained open until 19 March 1993, when the section of the railway between Walsall and Brierley Hill was closed. The most recent train believed to have crossed the viaduct was a cable laying train on 1 July 1993, nearly four months after the line's closure. The section of track over Parkhead Viaduct was removed in about 1995, with most of the track between Highgate Road and Blowers Green Road following in 1998 due to the construction of a new road bridge over the line nearby. The structure of the viaduct is still intact, but has fallen into disrepair and will undergo extensive refurbishment in order to be reutilised, with 2023 being the likely completion date to the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill extension of the West Midlands Metro tram network, which will make use of the viaduct.http://www.stourbridgelineusergroup.info/campaigns.html SLUG Campaigns ==References== Category:Railway bridges in the West Midlands (county) Category:Rail transport in Dudley Category:History of the West Midlands (county) Category:Bridges completed in 1880 ","title":"Parkhead Viaduct"},{"id":"7777226","text":"Erotic Poetry, released in 1991, is the first extended play (EP) album by Esham A.

The highway follows Chicago Drive, a local roadway, from Zeeland to Grandville. Chicago Drive itself runs past the M-121 segment on either side from Holland to Wyoming. The roadway passes through rural farmland on a route that runs parallel to Interstate 196 (I-196). M-121 forms the main street through the center of Hudsonville as it runs southwest–northeast. It forms a major street through the unincorporated community of Jenison before M-121 terminates at I-196 in Grandville. The M-121 designation has been used twice before in the state. The first was for a former routing of US Highway 2 (US 2), and the second was for a connection between I-69, I-75/US 23 and Bishop International Airport in the Flint area. Since 2007, M-121 has been used for a portion of the former M-21 in Ottawa County, which was formerly designated as state-maintained \\"Old M-21\\". Future plans will reconfigure a section of the current highway from four lanes divided to four lanes undivided. ==Route description== Chicago Drive, largely signed as M-121, is a combination state trunkline highway and municipal street running from 8th Street in Holland to the intersection of Grandville and Clyde Park avenues at the border of Grand Rapids and Wyoming, approximately in length. Running eastward, Chicago Drive picks up the Business Loop I-196 designation east of US 31\\\\. The highway has the typical mix of industry and commercial properties for the area. At 112th Avenue, it turns northeasterly to run through Zeeland. The roadway changes names when it turns due east again, where it is named Main Avenue and Main Place, comprising the only section of the route not designated Chicago Drive. M-121 runs through Jenison's business district Starting at the corner of Main Street and Chicago Drive, M-121 runs northeasterly out of Zeeland on Chicago Drive roughly parallel to I-196. A CSX railroad line also parallels the road to the northwest. The trunkline is a four-lane divided highway bordered by farms. Passing the Hudsonville Fair Grounds, Chicago Drive enters Hudsonville as the main street downtown. The highway continues to the northeast out of town through suburban residential areas to Jenison, where once again Chicago Drive is bordered by commercial properties. Through this area, the roadway is divided, utilizing Michigan lefts. The M-121 designation ends at the interchange with I-196 just across the Kent County line in Grandville. The corridor from I-196 to its end in Grand Rapids is lined with businesses and few houses. The intersection of Chicago Drive and Wilson Avenue is in downtown Grandville. In Wyoming from north of M-11 (28th Street) to Burlingame Avenue, Chicago Drive run through a mostly industrial area with few commercial properties. Northeast of about Byron Center Avenue, Chicago Drive carries Business Spur I-196 (BS I-196). At the corner with Grandville and Clyde Park avenues, Chicago Drive and BS I-196 ends. M-121 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the lowest traffic levels along M-121 were the 10,103 vehicles daily at the western terminus in Zeeland; the highest counts were the 20,140 vehicles per day at the eastern terminus. None of M-121 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. ==History== There have been three roadways to carry the M-121 designation in Michigan. ===Previous routings=== M-121 was also used as the designation along two other roadways. In 1933, it was used for a former routing of US 2 in the Upper Peninsula. In 1935, this route was redesignated as a portion of a new M-5 and the M-121 designation was transferred to Bristol Road in Flint. This Flint- area trunkline provided access to Bishop International Airport from both of the I-69 and I-75/US 23 freeways until it was retired in 2003. At that time, Bristol Road was returned to local control. ===Current routing=== M-121's exit off I-196 in Grandville; note that the sign for exit 69A incorrectly implies an eastward continuation of M-121 From 1919 to 1926, the current highway known as M-121 was designated M-51. Then until 1974, the trunkline was part of M-21; that designation was removed when I-196 was completed between those Zeeland and Grandville, and much of the route became an unsigned state trunkline designated Old M-21, although it is locally referred to by its given name, Chicago Drive. The portion of Chicago Drive now signed as M-121 is long; it was given its designation in late 2007. ==Future== Portions of the four-lane divided surface access highway along M-121 will become four-lane undivided as the westbound lanes are shifted south away from unstable soil and parallel train tracks. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * M-21 at Michigan Highways * M-51 at Michigan Highways * M-121 at Michigan Highways 121 Category:Transportation in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:Transportation in Kent County, Michigan ","title":"M-121 (Michigan highway)"},{"id":"7777251","text":"Christian Sebastián Cejas (born 21 April 1975) is an Argentine former footballer that played as goalkeeper and his last club was Chacarita Juniors of the Primera B Nacional.

(search for all versions on WorldCat) In 1803, she received the royal Swedish family as guests in Baden, during which it was said that she had the chance to gain influence over her son-in-law, as she was lovable and amusing, had a lively interest in politics and the same views as him.

(search for all versions on WorldCat) As an opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte, she had tried to prevent the wedding of her son to Stéphanie de Beauharnais, and after their wedding in 1806, she retired to her widow estate at Schloss Bruchsal in the Kraichgau. In 1807, Amalie sent her daughter, Queen Frederica of Sweden, a letter from her second daughter, the Empress of Russia, in an attempt to convince Frederica to use her influence to persuade her spouse to make peace between Sweden and Napoleon, which did not succeed.

In 1811, she tried to persuade Gustav Adolf not to divorce Frederica, but when it proved necessary, she arranged for her daughter's economic independence and the custody of her grandchildren. (search for all versions on WorldCat) In 1815, her grandson Gustav of Sweden was referred to as \\"Prince of Sweden\\" in an announcement from the Baden court, which caused protests from Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, who believed it to have been instigated by Amalie, as she had a reputation for plotting, in an attempt to secure a throne for her grandson. (search for all versions on WorldCat) During the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Amalie's influence upon her son-in-law Tsar Alexander I contributed to the fact that Baden was allowed to remain a Grand Duchy without loss of territory. She died in Bruchsal, aged 78, having outlived her husband and six of their eight children. ==Issue== * Princess Katharine Amalie Christiane Luise (13 July 1776 – 26 October 1823) * Princess Friederike Caroline Wilhelmine (13 July 1776 – 13 November 1841), married on 9 March 1797 the then Duke Maximilian of Zweibrücken as his second wife (and became grandmother of Empress Elisabeth of Austria).

Makkreel\\" ==Early life== Rudolf Makkreel was born in 1939 in Antwerp, Belgium and grew up in The Hague in the Netherlands. He immigrated to the USA in 1951 and received his BA and PhD from Columbia University. == Career == He taught at the University of California, San Diego until 1973 and at Emory University until 2013. He was the Editor of the Journal of the History of Philosophy from 1983 to 1998 and then President of its Board of Directors until 2018. Makkreel's work is concentrated on hermeneutics and aesthetics by developing ideas from the German philosophers Wilhelm Dilthey and Immanuel Kant. Makkreel has focused on the roles of the imagination, judgment, and interpretation within Kant's critical system. The implications of Kant's conception of reflective judgment for hermeneutics and for the theory of the human sciences are also central to Makkreel's writings. Makkreel has shown some important parallels between Kant's determinant-reflective judgment distinction and Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction. Neither distinction is merely oppositional.Makkreel, R. A. (1992) Dilthey, Philosopher of the Human Studies, Princeton University Press, pp. 218-262. Makkreel has argued that reflective judgments can provide the framework for determinant judgments and that the understanding of contextual socio-cultural systems in the human sciences leaves room for delimited lawful historical explanations. Some other themes that pervade Makkreel's writings include the difference between orientational and foundational principles as well as the relation between reflexive awareness and reflective consciousness. Our inner experience is not based on inner perception or acts of ocular introspection but on a directly felt reflexive self-awareness that coexists with outer experience. This reflexive awareness can orient the more mediated reflective consciousness of the world made possible by outer experience. Makkreel regards human experience as a complex of 1) what is aesthetically and medially assimilated from our surroundings, 2) how this is cognitively acquired through conceptualization, and 3) how this is reflectively appropriated into an overall perspective on the world. When disputes arise about meaning claims about the world, hermeneutics must diagnose at what level of experience a misunderstanding has arisen. ==Works== * Dilthey, Philosopher of the Human Studies, Princeton University Press, 1975, 1992. * Imagination and Interpretation in Kant, University of Chicago Press, 1990 * \\"Reflection, Reflective Judgment and Aesthetic Exemplarity' in \\"Aesthetics and Cognition in Kant's Critical Philosophy\\".

He was educated at Stockton Grammar School, Stockton-on-Tees, and at St Peter's College, Oxford. His research is concerned with psychological models and treatment of depression and suicidal behaviour. He uses experimental cognitive psychology – in particular investigations into the specificity of autobiographical memory – to help understand the processes that increase risk of suicidal behaviour in depression. With colleagues John D. Teasdale (Cambridge) and Zindel Segal (Toronto) he developed Mindfulness- based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; ) for prevention of relapse and recurrence in depression, and several RCTs have now found that MBCT significantly decreases the recurrence rate in those who have suffered three or more previous episodes of major depression.

He spent his youth in India, and on 24 November 1661 was knighted at Whitehall Palace. At the time the London East India Company had a new charter from Charles II, but the king's marriage to Catherine of Braganza involved the company because the island of Bombay had, under the marriage treaty, been ceded by Portugal to England, and it lay within the company's territories. The court of directors in March 1661 resolved to restore their trade in the East Indies, and appointed, on 19 March 1662, Sir George Oxenden to the post of president and chief director of all their affairs at Surat, and all other their factories in the north parts of India, from Ceylon to the Red Sea. A Oxenden found on his arrival in India that the company's trade was limited to the presidencies of Surat and Fort St. George, and to the factory at Bantam. The king's troops were coming from England to keep down private trade. Sir George Oxenden was instructed to assist them, and to abstain from embroiling the company with foreign powers. The States-General of the Dutch Republic were contesting the supremacy of the sea in Asia; English troops arrived, but were unable to obtain the immediate cession of Bombay, and Sir George Oxenden was prevented from assisting them by increased complications. France joined the Dutch Republic in threatening the company's trade, while the Mogul chieftains showed themselves jealous of English predominance. Aurungzebe, the Mogul emperor, looked for advantage from the superior naval powers. ==Battle of Surat== Sir Abraham Shipman, the commander of the royal troops, who had arrived in around September or October 1662, found himself powerless to take or hold Bombay. He therefore proposed to cede it to the company. Meanwhile, the government of Achin offered the whole of the trade of that port to the company, in return for the company's aid against the Dutch. Both of these offers were under Oxenden's consideration when, in January 1664, Surat was suddenly attacked by a force of Marathas, consisting of some four thousand horse under the command of Shivaji. The inhabitants fled. The governor shut himself up in the castle, while Oxenden and the company's servants fortified the English factory. One Englishman named Anthony Smith, was captured by the Marathas, and funds were demanded from him. Smith wrote an account of him witnessing Shivaji ordering the cutting off of the heads and hands of those who concealed their wealth.Vincent Arthur Smith (1919), The Oxford History of India, Oxford University Press, page 435 However, when king Shivaji understood that Smith was poor he was freed. When the Mughal Army finally approached on the fourth fateful day, Shivaji and his followers galloped southwards into the Deccan. Hence he was declared the most respective ruler. Only the well organized British, led by Oxenden, and the Portuguese survived the onslaught, but the city itself never recovered. Oxenden and his party defended themselves successfully but Shivaji took away an immense booty. Oxenden received the gratitude of Aurangzeb, and an extension of the privileges of trade to the English. Aurangzeb granted the English an exemption from the payment of customs for one year. ==Governor and commander-in-chief of Bombay== In March 1667, Charles II ceded Bombay to the East India Company, and they commissioned Oxenden to take possession of the island of Bombay. In August of that year the court of directors appointed him governor and commander-in-chief of Bombay, with power to nominate a deputy- governor to reside on the island, but he was placed under the control of the president and council of Surat. On 21 September 1667 the island was formally ceded by the royal troops to the new governor. The English officers and privates there were invited to enter the company's service, and thus the first military establishment of the East India Company at Bombay was created. On 14 July 1669 Oxenden died at Surat, and the company erected a monument over Sir George's grave there. Tomb of Sir George Oxenden and his brother Christopher Oxenden in the English Cemetery at Surat, 1855 His nephew, Sir Henry Oxenden, 3rd Baronet (d. 1709), who was for a short time deputy-governor of Bombay, was second son of George Oxenden's elder brother Henry, who was knighted on 9 June 1660, was M.P. for Sandwich, and was created a baronet on 8 May 1678. The latter's third son was George Oxenden the civil lawyer. ==See also== *Battle of Surat ==References== Category:People from Maharashtra Category:Governors of Bombay Category:1620 births Category:1669 deaths ","title":"George Oxenden (governor)"},{"id":"7777380","text":"Ransom Seaborn is the debut novel by singer-songwriter and recording artist Bill Deasy.

He is remembered today primarily for having introduced the first printing press, to Bombay in 1674-75.AK Priolkar, The Printing Press in India: Its Beginnings and Early Development, (Mumbai: Marathi Samsodhana Mandala, 1958), p. 32 Bhimji intended to use this printing press for \\"the common good\\" of printing \\"ancient manuscripts\\" that would be \\"useful or at least grateful to posterity\\".In a letter by Bhimji to the East India Company. Quoted in Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, p. 30. ==Life== Bhimji Parekh was the son of Tulsidas Parekh.Tulsidas Parekh was \\"a faithful and industrious servant of the Honorable company\\". See Gokhale, Surat In The Seventeenth Century, idk 121. At various times Bhimji Parekh worked as broker for the East India Company, as a money lender, and as a printer. For services to the company, Parekh was awarded a medal and chain of gold worth 150 shillings in 1683.Makrand Mehta, Indian Merchants and Entrepreneurs in Historical Perspective, (Delhi: Academic Foundation, 1991), p. 84. However, Gokhale claims the gold chain was worth £150. This is hardly believable. See Gokhale, Surat In The Seventeenth Century, p. 121 A notable incident in Parekh's life occurred when religious persecution in Surat had become unbearable; he organised and led a boycott by Hindu banias against Aurangzeb. Over 800 merchants left Surat en masse. The boycott was successful and in December 1669, they returned to Surat upon promises of religious tolerance.Gokhale, Surat In The Seventeenth Century, p. 48. Not many years later, Parekh would play a central role in the exodus of hundreds of Hindu banias from Surat to Bombay.For an account of the protest, and the eventual migration of hundreds of hindu businessmen from Surat to Bombay, see: Mehta, Indian Merchants and Entrepreneurs in Historical Perspective, pp 78-83. Apart from a printing error, which would suggest that Parekh lived to be over 80 years old, this account appears to be accurate. His grandson married a Jain lady.Mehboob Desai, Bhimji Parekh, (Divy Bhasakar New Paper, Gujarati, Ahmedabad) p.4, Parekh's family then adopted the Jainism. Parekh died in 1686 and left two under-aged sons, Vanmalidas and Shankardas, who would play an important part in the business life of Surat.Gokhale, Surat In The Seventeenth Century, p. 85 ==The Printing Press== In 1674-75, a printing press had been brought to the island of Bombay for the first time. In the fifth session of the All India Library Conference in Mumbai in 1942, Sri K M Munshi claimed that this printing press had been sold to Bhimji Parekh by Shivaji.quoted in Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, p. 29 However, no evidence was found to support this claim. Correspondence between Bhimjee Parekh and the East India Company indicate that Bhimji had imported the press on his own initiative.Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, pp. 30-32 In a letter from Surat to the East India Company dated 9 January 1670: :\\"Bimgee Parrack makes his humble request to you that you would please to send out an able Printer to Bombay, for that he hath a curiosity and earnest Inclynation to have some of the Ancient Brahminy Writings in Print and for the said Printer’s encouragement he is willing to allow him £.50 a year for three years, and also to be at (bear?) the charges of tools and Instruments necessary for him…\\"quoted in Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, p. 30 In another letter from London to Surat, dated 3 April 1674, it is stated that: :\\"We have also entertained Mr. Henry Hills a printer for our Island of Bombay at the salary of £.50 per annum and ordered a printing press with letters and other necessaries as also a convenient quantity of paper to be sent along with him…all of which is to be charged upon Bhimgee from whome you are to receive it.\\"Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, p. 30-1 Bhimji had stated clearly in his 1670s letter to the East India Company that he wished to print \\"Ancient Brahminy Writings\\". Perhaps it is not entirely surprising the Company acceded to his request with, among other considerations, the hope that it would help spread Christian faith: :\\"We should gladly hear that Bingees design about the printing do take effect, that may be a means to propagate our religion whereby souls may be gained as well as Estates.\\"Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, p. 31 The expert printer, Henry Hills, did arrive as was promised. He did not however, have the skills to cut types in Indic scripts. Bhimji, therefore, asked the company to secure a type-founder. In a letter from Surat to the East India Company, dated 23 January 1676: :\\"The Printing design doth not yet meet with the success as expected by Bimgee Parrack.... Wee have seen some papers printed in the Banian Character by the persons employed by Bimgee which looks very well and legible and shews the work is feasible; but the charge and tediousness of these people for want of better experience doth much discourage, if you Honours would please to send out a founder of [sic] Caster of letters at Bimgees charge he would esteem it a great favor and honor…\\"Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, pp. 31-32. Against the Englishman’s apparent lack of training, Gokhale contests that the \\"Englishman refused to impart his skill to Indians.\\" Gokhale, however, does not cite any sources to substantiate his opinion. See Gokhale, Surat In The Seventeenth Century, pp. 121, 145. The company responded in a letter dated 15 March 1677: :\\"Wee wish the Printing business may take effect, if wee can procure a Founder of letters he shall be sent by these ships.\\"Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, p. 32 This type-founder did not arrive. Bhimji Parekh failed to realize his ambition of printing literature in Indian characters. The press might have printed some literature in English. It would be reasonable to assume that some types would have been brought with the press. Priolkar substantiates this opinion by citing two documents that suggests printed material was available in Bombay at this time. In The Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island, in a passage about innovations introduced by General Aungier: :\\"Other innovations of more or less importance were the establishment of a Mint…the opening of a printing press, the building of houses…\\"Quoted in Priolkar, The Printing Press in India, p. 33 Captain Alexander Hamilton, who had travelled to India for business between 1628 and 1723, mentioned that he saw certain printed documents during his stay in Bombay: :\\"…The Articles of his Grievances I saw in a printed copy and were as follows, in 35 Articles.\\" ==See also== * Fardunjee Marzban ==Notes and references== Category:Year of birth missing Category:History of Mumbai Category:Gujarati people Category:17th-century Indian Jains ","title":"Bhimjee Parikh"},{"id":"7777430","text":"Seven Islands of Bombay The Old Woman's Island, also known as Little Colaba is one of the seven islands composing the city of Mumbai, India, and part of the historic Old Bombay.

Its elevation is . The 2010 census population was 761. The 2010 census was the first time the community has been recognized by the U.S. Census bureau. The town has a grange hall, church, fire station and general store and is known for equestrian properties as well as small farms. ==Early history== Long ago Native Americans burned away the underbrush on the bluff to give them better vision while they hunted game. A repercussion of this act was the growth of thick green grass around the evergreen trees, giving the area a park-like appearance. The bluff was given the name \\"Green Bluff\\" by early pioneers. Peone Prairie, a valley to the south of the bluff was a gathering place for Native American tribes who frequented Green Bluff. Baptiste Peone was chief of the valley camp, and his wife and children were baptized by Ref. J.M. Cataldo in 1864. Cataldo became missionary for the Spokanees in 1867, and soon baptized every member of the camp. As many as 500 Native Americans gathered in the valley for horse races. Green Bluff was favored as a lookout spot and hunting ground for the natives of the area. Most of the trappers and hunters eventually moved on, and a lumber industry with several saw mills arose in the area. Some pioneers took logs to Newman Lake, and traded them for lumber. Many homes were built from the area’s wood.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 231 Some families from Germany moved into the area around 1889. There were still many pine and fir tree roots on the bluff, so much of the early work by these settlers was removal of the roots, which took a great deal of work and time. As time passed, the area was opened up to farming.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 232 There were few trails and no roads on the bluff, so transportation was difficult. Because of the vast amount of roots that needed to be cleared, the early settlers had to find a crop that would grow between tree stumps. Strawberries were the early choice, and were picked for years.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 234 Since Green Bluff was a day’s ride by wagon northeast of Spokane, in 1909 the area was officially called the \\"Green Bluff Township #20.\\" Officers who carried out governing duties such as a clerk, assessor and treasurer were elected by the community and held monthly and annual meetings until 1972, when the township was disbanded by demand of the county. It was one of the last townships in the area.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 13 The Green Bluff Grange is described as \\"an agricultural fraternity and its purpose is to build a program of fellowship, service and member activities.\\"Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 150 Green Bluff Grange #300 was first organized in 1909, and meetings were held twice a month, on the second and fourth Saturdays of the month. In March 1909, the idea of building a community hall was proposed, and the hall was soon built by many local people who purchased shares. Meetings were held in the hall except when the $5 a month rent could not be paid. On those months, meetings were held in the schoolhouse. Then in 1916 the Hall burned down. There were long periods of inactivity at this point, until 1929 when the idea of building a new Grange Hall was proposed. It wasn’t until 1934 that an old boarding house in Elk, Washington was torn down and the wood was used to build the new Grange Hall. It was completed in May 1935, and still stands to this day, serving the community every month.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 150-151 There are many farms on Green Bluff which can be found at GreenbluffGrowers.com. Green Bluff is known for dry land farming and is home to breweries, a winery, cidery, meadery, and catering company, as well as an abundance of fresh produce including strawberries, rhubarb, lavender, cherries, raspberries, apricots, peaches, pears, blackberries, apples, nectarines, potatoes, carrots, cabbages, christmas trees and much more. ==Local buildings== In central Green Bluff, there is a school, a church, a fire station, a grange hall, and a general store. ;School Green Bluff School District #101 was formed on February 18, 1891. Land was purchased in 1891 for purpose of building a school. Another acre of land was given to the school some years later. In 1913, more property was purchased, giving the school ground a total of . In the early years, the school was surrounded by apple trees that had to be dug out by hand. The first school was a one-room log building. By 1901, a new, one-room framed school was built. In June 1906, a second room was added; in 1910, a third room was added. In 1945, the frame schoolhouse was dismantled and a new \\"chicken-house\\" was built, which still stands today. In 1952 it was faced with brick, and in 1969 a third classroom was added. In 1970 its doors were closed, until 1972 when it became the Green Bluff Learning Center, which was an alternative school for boys with special learning needs. That lasted until 1976. Then in 1977, because of crowded conditions, all first-graders from Colbert Elementary School were transferred to Green Bluff’s school, which continued until 1980, the last year that students were taught at the school.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 188-195 It was later purchase by the local church, serving as a community center and pre-school. ;Church The first Green Bluff United Methodist Church was built in 1909. It was created by the community, since until that time, only a visiting minister provided Sunday school, just once a month. The community agreed to pay him a $200 salary to come every Sunday and provide services in the schoolhouse until a church could be built. Many pastors served the church in its early years, coming from the Peone or the Mead parsonage. On March 16, 1945, the church was completely destroyed by fire. The cause is assumed to be an overheated furnace. Church services took place in the grange until the new church’s dedication on May 4, 1947.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 140-141 That building still stands to this day, ministered by the Mead parsonage. ;General store The Green Bluff General Store has existed for over a hundred years, surviving two locations, two fires and three different buildings. It no longer has the full-service use it once did, but the location on the corner of Green Bluff and Day-Mt. Spokane Rd. hasn’t changed since 1910. It was originally located at the corner of Halliday and Day-Mt. Spokane Rd., and called \\"Abbott’s Store.\\" After a year or two the store closed due to a property dispute. In 1910 the first store in its present location was built. It burned around 1923 or ’24. Rev. Wellington operated the \\"Green Bluff Mercantile\\" for twenty years, sometimes marrying people in the store rather than the church. In 1955 the store burned down, and a replacement store wasn’t built until 1958. It still stands to this day, although there have been many different owners.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 231 Nowadays, the store is relatively abandoned, only opened occasionally to sell arts and crafts. ;Fire station The original Green Bluff Fire Station was built in the early 1960s northeast of the Green Bluff store and church. It was a small red building housing a 5 to 7-thousand gallon water tank beneath it. Need for a fire station arose after the 1955 burning of the general store and a local barn. Fundraising for the fire station took place in 1960. The first fire chief was elected in November 1962, and in January 1963, Green Bluff got its first fire truck, a 1963 GMC converted gasoline delivery truck. A new station was built in the 1990s west of the school and church, and continues to serve the area.Hogue, Jadee, Haldar, Anna and Mae Turner, \\"Green Bluff’s Heritage\\", Ye Galleon Press, 1984, p. 144-145 ==ReferencesU.S. Department of Agriculture.

Ott, \\"Urban space, memory, and episcopal authority: The bishops of Amiens in peace and conflict, 1073-1164\\", Viator 31.3, 2000). His feast day is May 16. ==Hagiography== He was born in Port-le-Grand (Ponthieu) near Amiens to a noble family. He was said to be virtuous from birth. He was taught by his predecessor in the bishopric of Amiens, Saint Beatus (Beat). He resisted being elected bishop of Amiens, believing himself unworthy of this honor. According to hagiographic tradition, a ray of light of divine origin descended upon his head upon his election as bishop. There also appeared holy oil of unknown origin on his forehead. According to a legend, when it was known in his hometown that he had been proclaimed bishop, his nursemaid, who was baking bread for the family, refused to believe that Honoratus had been elevated to such a position. She remarked that she would believe the news only if the peel she had been using to bake bread put down roots and turned itself into a tree. When the peel was placed into the ground, it was transformed into a mulberry tree that gave flowers and fruit. This miraculous tree was still being shown in the sixteenth century. During his bishopric, he discovered the relics of Victoricus, Fuscian, and Gentian, which had remained hidden for 300 years. ==Veneration== A branch of Saint Honore Cake Shop, a Hong Kong chain bakery popular in Hong Kong and Macau His devotion was widespread in France following reports of numerous miracles when his body was exhumed in 1060. After his death, his relics were invoked against drought. Bishop Guy, son of the Count of Amiens, ordered that a procession be held, in which an urn holding Honoratus' relics were carried around the walls of the city. Rain is said to have fallen soon after. In 1240, during construction of the cathedral of Amiens, the relics of Honoratus were carried through the surrounding countryside in a quest for funds.\\"Such a relic quest is depicted in the tympanum of the south transept\\" of Amiens, according to Stephen Murray, A Gothic Sermon: Making a Contract with the Mother of God, Saint Mary of Amiens. In 1202, a baker named Renold Theriens (Renaud Cherins) donated to the city of Paris some land to build a chapel in honor of the saint. The chapel became one of the richest in Paris, and gave its name to Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. In 1400, the bakers of Paris established their guild in the church of Saint Honoratus, celebrating his feast on 16 May and spreading his cult. He is also the patron of a Carthusian establishment at Abbeville, which was founded in 1306. In 1659, Louis XIV ordered that every baker observe the feast of Saint Honoratus, and give donations in honor of the saint and for the benefit of the community.Honorato de Amiens, Santo He is the namesake of the St. Honoré Cake.

The Château du Raincy was constructed between 1643 and 1650 by Jacques Bordier, indendant des finances, on the site of a Benedictine priory on the road from Paris to Meaux, in the present-day commune of Le Raincy in the Seine-Saint-Denis department of France. ==The Château== Louis Le Vau was put in charge of the design of the building.Floorplans, which included a chambre à l'italienne, are illustrated and discussed in Dietrich Feldmann, \\"Das Hôtel de La Vrillière und die Räume 'a l'italienne' bei Louis Le Vau\\" Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 45.4 (1982), pp. 412ff. The gardens are traditionally ascribed to André Le Nôtre and the interior decoration to Charles Le Brun. This team of masters also worked on the châteaux at Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles. Surrounded by five pavilions and a network of dry moats, the château du Raincy was at the heart of a private estate imbued with royal magnificence. The monumental stables could accommodate 200 horses. After Bordier added the adjacent territory of the seigneurie of Bondy to it, the park of 240 hectares was one of the most extensive in the vicinity of Paris. Bordier's expenses amounted to the exorbitant sum of 4,500,000 livres, swallowing up his fortune. After Bordier's death in 1660, his son and heir, Hilaire, was constrained to sell the property to Princess Palatine, Anna Maria Gonzaga in 1663. In November 1664 Molière's troupe was commanded to perform at Le Raincy by her son-in-law, the prince de Condé.\\"Light on Molière in 1664 from Le Second Registre de la Thorillière\\" PMLA 53.4 (December 1938:1071f) After her death, in 1684, the estate passed to her daughter, Anne Henriette of Bavaria (1648–1723). Ten years later, Anne's husband, prince Henri Jules de Bourbon-Condé, ceded the property to Louis Sanguin, marquis du Livry, premier maître d'hôtel du Roi et capitaine des chasses; joining the domain to his of Livry, the house became known as the château de Livry. A 17th-century view of the Château and gardens, engraved by a member of the Perelle family In 1769, the château was purchased by Louis Philippe d'Orléans, who had both the garden and interiors upgraded. His heir, Philippe-Égalité, engaged the Scottish gardener Thomas Blaikie to replace the formal gardens with a more natural landscape, one of the first jardins à l'anglaise in France.Patricia Taylor, Thomas Blaikie (1751-1838): The 'Capability' Brown of France 2001. The park was dotted with numerous follies, including an \\"old tower\\", a \\"farm\\", a decorative kennel, an hermitage, and the celebrated Maisons Russes, scored to imitate Russian isbas (log houses). One was open to visitors as the \\"caffé Restorateur du Reinci dans le goût Russe\\" as a contemporary engraving labels it;Illustrated by Darra Goldstein, \\"Russia, Carême, and the Culinary Arts\\" The Slavonic and East European Review 73.4 (October 1995):691-715) fig. 1, p. 701. To add to the ambience of its parc à l'anglaise, the waiters spoke English.Goldstein 1995:699. ==Revolution, First Empire== During the French Revolution, the demesne was confiscated by the government and then passed through a succession of owners. Madame Récamier hosted brilliant fêtes at Le Raincy under the Directoire. Neglected and left in a bad state of disrepair since that period, the château designed by Le Vau was demolished and replaced by a conventional neoclassical building in the first decade of the 19th century, at the time of Napoléon I's First Empire, as can be seen in an engraving from 1808.http://www.atlas-patrimoine93.fr/pg- html/bases_doc/inventaire/fiche.php?idfic=062s003. Napoleon I acquired Le Raincy in 1812, but the Prussian army quartered there in 1815. The new château fell into neglect and was eventually demolished in 1819. ==Restoration, July Monarchy, Second Empire== During the Restoration (1815–1830), Le Raincy reverted to the House of Orléans. During his reign, known as the July Monarchy (1830–1848), King Louis Philippe used the grounds for hunting, while his retinue would stay at the Maisons Russes. At the beginning of the Second Empire, by decrees of January 22 and March 27, 1852, the Orléans were dispossessed of their Raincy estate which became a domaine d'État. Houses began to be built in the park and in 1869, they formed the town of Le Raincy. Nowadays, very little subsists of Bordier's estate. The statues of Henri II, Charles IX, Henri III, and Henri IV were transferred to the Louvre; the farm was converted into the Saint-Louis church; only a part of the orangery is still visible. ==References== == External links == This article is based on a translation of the equivalent article of the French Wikipedia on 4 November 2006 Raincy Raincy Category:Houses completed in 1650 Category:1643 establishments in France Category:1819 disestablishments Category:French formal gardens ","title":"Château du Raincy"},{"id":"7777494","text":"The Kremsier Parliament (Assembly at Kroměříž) was a constituent assembly called in July 1848 in reaction to opposition to the Pillersdorf Constitution of 25 April 1848 and would last until its dissolution on 7 March 1849. Its main product was the Kremsier Constitution which was preempted by the imposed March Constitution. ==Historical background== The Kremsier Parliament had been elected in June, and convened in July in reaction to the Pillersdorf Constitution of 25 April 1848. The Kremsier Parliament formerly convened in Vienna but later resided in Kremsier, Moravia, to avoid martial law in Vienna following the Vienna Uprising. Following the popular trend in Europe during the Revolutions of 1848, in October 1848 workers rioted in Vienna for a constitutional monarchy and blockaded the troop transports headed for Hungary. The workers hoped that siding with the Hungarian rebellion would bring military strength to the Viennese workers revolt. However, the revolt failed when General Windisch-Grätz surrounded the city and violently crushed the workers. With Vienna under martial law, the Assembly decided to move to Kremsier to write the new constitution.Victor Tapie, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Habsburg Monarchy\\" trans. Stephen Hardman (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1969) 282. ==The Kremsier Assembly== The overarching theme of the Assembly's deliberations was the vast array of conflicting nationalities living under the Habsburg Monarchy. In the first week of March 1849, the Kremsier Constitution was completed. It featured many liberal and progressive reforms including forming a constitutional monarchy, creating a parliament that would share power with the Emperor, abolishing the privileged status and all titles of the Catholic Church within the Empire, deriving the Emperor's power from the people rather than the \\"Grace of God,\\"J.A.S. Grenville, \\"Europe Reshaped 1848-1878\\" Second Edition (Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 2000) 110. and finally, making all languages and nationalities equal in the eyes of the Monarchy.Robert Okey, \\"The Habsburg Monarchy c. 1765-1918\\" (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2001) 200. The Kremsier Constitution was short-lived, however, with Prime Minister Felix Schwarzenberg dissolving the Assembly and nullifying the constitution within days of completing the document (sometime between 4 March 1849 and 6 March 1849 depending on source used). ==Critique of the Assembly== Edward Crankshaw raises three major critiques of the Kremsier Assembly in his book, The Fall of the House of Habsburg. First, the constitution claimed that all political power was derived from the people yet it called for a central authority.Edward Crankshaw, \\"The Fall of the House of Habsburg.\\" (New York: Penguin Books, 1963) 63. Could anyone have honestly thought a Habsburg Emperor with central authority vested in him would have been an ideological proponent of and see himself as an extension of a Rousseauan \\"will of the people\\"? Is it even possible to understand one's subjects if they come from thirteen major ethnicities? Second, the Assembly had zero representatives from Hungary since the region was in revolt, thus all Hungarian issues were completely ignored. Third, the Assembly failed to take into account the larger picture, meaning there was no acknowledgement of the Frankfurt Assembly's attempts to create a unified Germany (including the German states within Austria) and there was no realization that the Prime Minister, Schwarzenberg, was drawn to the Frankfurt Assembly. ==Reaction to the Kremsier Constitution== Following the dissolution of the Assembly, Schwarzenberg had his own constitution drawn up. The new constitution saved only one significant piece of the Kremsier Constitution: vernaculars were now permissible at the local levels for all non-political discussion. Besides this stripped version of an article in the Kremsier Constitution, four major points were drawn up in the new constitution: 1) the Emperor was given absolute authority in dealing with the military and foreign policy. 2) Parliament would meet once a year but the Emperor had the power to dismiss them and veto all legislation Parliament passed, effectively turning Parliament into a bicameral debate society. 3) the Emperor was equipped with an advisory council of his choosing. 4) German was the official language of the Empire for politics, education, and administration and the Empire was united under one crown, one constitution, and one parliament. As one can see, the progressive movement of the Kremsier Parliament created a devastating backlash against the growing national identities of the Empire. The Empire was now tightly controlled in a neo-absolutist regime with a hostile attitude towards nationalist tendencies. ==Footnotes== Category:Kroměříž District Category:1848 establishments in the Austrian Empire Category:1849 disestablishments in the Austrian Empire ","title":"Kremsier Parliament"},{"id":"7777497","text":"Russian stamp of Mikhail Prishvin Mikhail Mikhailovich Prishvin () (January 23 (N.S.

Hansen cleared 5 meters on his first attempt, but so did three German athletes. Hansen then passed the next height, watching as only Wolfgang Reinhardt was able to clear. Re-entering the competition at 5.10, Hansen failed his first two attempts, but so did Reinhardt. Hansen then sailed over his final attempt, while Reinhart could not. Hansen continued the American streak, which would survive through one more Olympics until the 1972 pole vault controversy, when defending champion Bob Seagren had his pole confiscated at the games and had to compete on an unfamiliar, borrowed pole. ==Other achievements== Besides pole vault Hansen competed in the long jump.

She was named for Marine Corporal Lewis K. Bausell (1924–1944), who was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for \\"conspicuous gallantry\\" during the Battle of Peleliu. ==Post World War II== Bausell was laid down on 28 May 1945 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works; launched on 19 November 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Lawrence K. Bausell, Corporal Bausell's mother. She was commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts on 7 February 1946, Commander James V. Bewick in command. After a month fitting out at the Boston Naval Shipyard, the destroyer conducted an eight-week shakedown and training cruise to the West Indies. Returning to Boston on 4 June, the warship underwent four weeks of post-shakedown repairs before sailing for duty with the Pacific Fleet on 5 July. Passing through the Panama Canal soon thereafter, she arrived at her new homeport of San Diego, California on the 23d. USS Bausell (DD-845) in 1946. Bausell, although immobilized in port owing to crew shortages, joined Destroyer Division 12 (DesDiv 12) on 30 November. When enough crewmembers became available in January 1947, she began a more active period of local operations out of San Diego. The destroyer participated in fleet exercises held in the Hawaiian Islands in late February; and, in early March, she assisted in a fruitless search for survivors of the foundered merchantman Fort Dearborn. Ordered to Pearl Harbor on 8 July, she conducted reserve training duty in that port until sailing for Bremerton, Washington, on 1 October. Upon arrival, the destroyer underwent a four-month modernization overhaul. Bausell returned to San Diego in late February 1948 and prepared for her first Far East cruise. Departing San Diego on 9 March, the warship first steamed to Pearl Harbor for two weeks of antisubmarine (ASW) exercises. Late that month, she got underway for China, arriving at Tsingtao on 15 April. For the next six months, the destroyer ranged the length and breadth of the Yellow Sea, escorting American shipping in the region, until the Chinese government closed the mainland ports to American warships. She returned to San Diego on 26 November. For the next year, Bausell conducted local operations out of San Diego with DesDiv 12\\\\. These continued until 11 November 1949, when she again sailed for the western Pacific. Arriving at Subic Bay on 30 November, Bausell remained in Philippine waters through the end of the year. On 7 January 1950 she set course for the Chinese coast to assist SS Flying Arrow, a merchant ship that had been damaged by gunfire from a Chinese ship and was anchored off the Yangtze estuary. On 10 January, in company with and , the destroyer shielded the merchant ship. Bausell then conducted surveillance operations off the Yangtze estuary, outside Tsingtao, and near the Barren Islands, returning to Subic Bay on 27 January. ==Korean War== The destroyer conducted patrols in Philippine and Japanese waters before setting out for the west coast on 20 May. After a leisurely voyage during which she stopped at Guam and Pearl Harbor, Bausell arrived in San Diego on 13 June. She spent the three months after her return engaged in local operations and then entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for an eight-week overhaul. On 19 February 1951, the destroyer sailed for Korean waters in company with two other DesDiv 12 ships, and . The warship made Sasebo, Japan, on 18 March and, three days later, joined Task Force 77 (TF 77) off the east coast of Korea. Operating with during this tour, Bausell patrolled the Songjin-Wonsan area for North Korean small craft and conducted shore bombardment missions from 24 to 28 April. Reassigned to the Taiwan Strait Patrol, a presence established in June 1950 to discourage the two Chinese governments from widening the war, the destroyer cruised near the Pescadores Islands from 11 June to 18 July. Returning to Korean waters on 7 August, she engaged in five more weeks of patrol operations before sailing for San Diego on 16 September. Bausell spent the next seven months conducting local operations, practicing her gunnery, and training new crew members. Underway for Korean waters on 20 May 1952, the destroyer returned to patrol operations with TF 77 off the east coast of Korea. She conducted naval gunfire support as needed, engaging in gunnery duels with shore batteries four times over the course of the summer. On occasion, the warship also screened carrier task forces and carried out planeguard duties in their area of activity. Her tour of duty over, she set course for San Diego early in December, arriving there on the 20th. On 29 January 1953, Bausell commenced a six-month overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. After the repairs were finished in July, the destroyer spent two months conducting refresher training in preparation for her fifth Far East deployment. Departing San Diego on 8 September, she returned to Korean waters and helped other 7th Fleet units monitor the s:Korean Armistice Agreement on the peninsula. Bausell steamed off Korea and Taiwan for six months, putting into such ports as Yokosuka, Pusan, and Keelung infrequently for upkeep and repair. Relieved in late March 1954, she returned to San Diego on 16 April. The warship made her sixth western Pacific cruise between November 1954 and April 1955. Although initially operating out of Subic Bay, Bausell received orders sending her north after Chinese communist aircraft engaged Chinese nationalist shipping at Ichiang, in the Tachen Islands, on 10 January 1955. The destroyer patrolled the surrounding seas for the following three weeks, while diplomats tried to resolve the crisis. In early February, when the decision was made to evacuate the Chinese nationalists from the islands, she stood by in support of that operation. Following a port visit to Hong Kong and a short repair period at Sasebo, the destroyer returned to the United States early in April 1955. ==Interwar years== Over the next four years, Bausell deployed to the western Pacific three more times. During these cruises, she conducted ASW exercises with other 7th Fleet units, patrolled the seas off China and Korea, and trained with other navies in Philippine and Australian waters. This pattern of operations came to be fairly characteristic of a Navy warship's tours of duty in the Far East in the period of relative peace between the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953 and the intensification of the Vietnam War just over a decade later. In July 1960, Bausell entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to undergo alterations as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. Devised to counter growing numbers of Soviet submarines, the conversion process armed Bausell with antisubmarine rockets (ASROC) and ASW torpedoes, added helicopter equipment and advanced electronics gear, and improved her radar and sonar capabilities. After these modifications were completed on 15 July 1961, the warship made a short shakedown cruise to Vancouver, British Columbia, before steaming to San Diego. There, for the next 14 months, she conducted sea trials and weapons exercises to test her new equipment. During the summer of 1962, the destroyer visited Seattle for the World's Fair and participated in the Rose Festival in Portland, Oregon. On 11 May 1962, Agerholm test fired a nuclear ASROC missile towards Bausell to test its capability to withstand the radioactive \\"base surge\\" resulting from the underwater explosion.1962 ASROC Navy Nuclear Tests from USS Agerholm DD826 The entire crew disembarked from the ship prior to the test, leaving behind test instruments. The base surge never reached the ship. ==Vietnam War== Bausell sailed for the Far East again in November 1962. There, the destroyer spent six months patrolling in the South China Sea and conducting goodwill visits to Singapore, Djakarta, and Darwin. Returning home on 30 June 1963, she carried out local operations out of San Diego into November. Following an extended maintenance period at the Naval Repair Facility, San Diego, Bausell resumed local operations out of that port on 22 March 1964. These activities, including helicopter qualification trials and weapons exercises, continued through July. On 5 August, the destroyer sailed for duty in the western Pacific. Bausell soon joined other 7th Fleet forces concentrating in the South China Sea. This provided escort services for the growing numbers of American carriers and amphibious units operating off Vietnam. These patrols continued through the new year until the destroyer returned to San Diego in February 1965. Over the next 11 months, Bausell kept busy fulfilling training and other commitments stateside. These included night planeguard assignments for aircraft carriers off the California coast, intensified ASW training to cope with the new Soviet submarines operating in the Pacific, and a six-week midshipmen cruise to Tacoma, San Francisco, and Pearl Harbor during the summer. Owing to widened American participation in combat operations in southeast Asia, Bausell set course for Vietnam on 7 January 1966. Her first assignment in the South China Sea consisted of monitoring the movements of the Russian trawler Protractor and preventing that ship from intercepting Navy tactical communications. In addition to providing planeguard and screening services for the carriers and , she also served as a naval gunfire support (NGFS) ship and on the Tonkin Gulf search and rescue (SAR) station. In March and April, the destroyer fired over 7,000 5-inch rounds at shore targets; and, in company with the destroyer , the warship also rescued four downed pilots. She then visited Subic Bay and several other Far Eastern ports before steaming for home on 27 June. Upon returning to San Diego, the warship prepared for a regular overhaul at the San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard. Beginning on 23 September, shipyard workers modernized her 5-inch gun mounts, reworked the main engineering plant, and overhauled the sonar, fire-control radar, and electronic counter-measures (ECM) gear. After a successful sea trial on 22 December, Bausell began a series of exercises—including gunnery, shore bombardment, planeguard, and helicopter training—that lasted through April 1967. The warship departed San Diego on 15 May and arrived at Subic Bay on 12 June after visits to Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Yokosuka. Bausell loaded supplies and ammunition, getting underway for \\"Yankee Station\\" on 17 June. There, she provided escort and ASW services to the carriers and until 14 July. After a brief call at Sasebo, the destroyer returned to the Gulf of Tonkin and served with the carrier until 17 August when she was ordered to the gunline off Vietnam. For the next 10 days, Bausell conducted shore-bombardment missions off Đồng Hới, remaining on call into September. On 13 September, she returned to the Gulf of Tonkin for escort duties. Three weeks later, after an ASW exercise with the submarine , she sailed for the west coast, arriving in San Diego on 25 October. Following 10 months of local operations the warship prepared for her 15th Far Eastern deployment. Departing San Diego on 7 September 1968, Bausell stopped at Yokosuka and Subic Bay, before joining the carrier in the Gulf of Tonkin on 10 October. Four days later, after rendezvous with the cruiser , the vessel conducted a week of naval gunfire missions against North Vietnamese coastal targets. After returning to the carriers in late October, the destroyer conducted planeguard and ASW assignments on \\"Yankee Station\\", served on the gunline off Da Nang, and completed four weeks on SAR station with Worden, before steaming out of the combat zone in February 1969. Although she departed Yokosuka for San Diego on 21 February, she made a brief detour to the Ogasawara Islands on the 23 February. There, she rescued the crew of a burning Japanese fishing vessel before resuming her voyage home. Arriving at San Diego on 4 March, the warship served as an engineering school ship and conducted other local operations until 28 July when she entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Completing a three-month overhaul on 4 November, the destroyer resumed local operations out of San Diego. Bausell returned to the familiar operations off the Indochinese peninsula in June 1970. She served on the northern SAR station, acted as planeguard on \\"Yankee Station\\" for the carriers Oriskany and , and carried out positive identification radar advisory zone (PIRAZ) duty in the Gulf of Tonkin through August. The warship cruised on the gunline in September, firing at targets as needed, and screened the carrier on \\"Yankee Station\\" in October. After a brief diversion north to the Paracel Islands to investigate Russian trawler traffic, the destroyer headed for home on 14 November. Arriving in San Diego on 1 December, the warship spent the first eight months of 1971 either in port at San Diego or conducting local exercises off the California coast. On 1 September, Bausell learned of her assignment to a new home port—Yokosuka, Japan—as part of the Navy's forward deployment program. She departed San Diego on 20 October and moored at Yokosuka on 11 November. Her first mission, that began on 1 December, took the ship from Sasebo to Subic Bay on an amphibious convoy exercise. While off Taiwan, the destroyer successfully defended the convoy when she scored a simulated ASROC \\"kill\\" against the submarine . On 14 December, because of increased tension between East Pakistan, India, and West Pakistan, the task group – which became Task Force 74 – received orders sending it through the Strait of Malacca. The amphibious forces, supported by the carrier , cruised off Ceylon in case American citizens needed emergency evacuation. With the Indian Army's intervention in Kashmir and East Pakistan, the fighting soon ended and the crisis ebbed with the establishment of the Bangladeshi government in the former East Pakistan the following month. Detached from Indian Ocean operations on 6 January 1972, Bausell steamed to the combat zone adjacent to Vietnam. In company with the destroyer , the ships conducted a naval gunfire support mission off Point Virna before putting into Vũng Tàu on 11 January. At sea again the following day, the warship visited Hong Kong and Okinawa before returning to Yokosuka on 20 January. Bausell remained in Japan for upkeep and training until 18 February when she headed back to Vietnam. On 4 March, the destroyer joined the carrier Coral Sea on \\"Yankee Station.\\" She conducted screen and lifeguard operations for several days, dutifully rescuing a man overboard from on 6 March, until ordered to the Vietnamese coast. For the next two months, the warship served on the gunline, firing support missions to aid friendly forces ashore and repeatedly suppressing shore batteries on Hon Matt Island. After a brief call at Yokosuka in mid-May, the destroyer returned to the gunline on the 21st and conducted harassing, interdiction, and illumination fire into June. On 10 June, while off Hon La Island, North Vietnam, the destroyer was hit by a single shell. It started a small fire in an empty ASROC launcher cell, which was quickly put out; and Bausell continued on assigned duties. She returned to Japan in early July. Over the next four months, the warship served on the gunline three more times, conducting NGFS missions, surveillance duties, and assisting PIRAZ ships. On 28 October, Bausell rendezvoused with the destroyer ; and, together, they commenced bombardment missions on petroleum storage sites, shore batteries, and roads in the Đồng Hới area. During these operations, which lasted until 7 November, she also fired two \\"Shrike\\" radar-homing missiles at North Vietnamese Army (NVA) shore installations. Ordered south to evade a typhoon, the destroyer returned to the gunline on 16 November for eight days of fire support missions before steaming to Yokosuka on 5 December. Bausell sailed back to the gunline on 22 January 1973, this time off Point Allison near the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Underway replenishment kept her on the line, firing at harassment and interdiction targets as well as at the occasional hostile shore battery, until the truce began on 28 January. Following port visits to Bangkok, Thailand, and to Singapore, the warship steamed home to Yokosuka for three weeks of upkeep and repair. Underway on 22 March, Bausell visited Kobe, carried out gunnery shoots near Okinawa, and conducted ASW exercises with the submarine . After a day in Buckner Bay to load fuel and supplies, she joined the destroyers and for a large combined US/ROKN amphibious exercise off Yang Po Ri, South Korea. The destroyer also visited Hong Kong before returning to Yokosuka on 28 April. Following the 34th Black Ship Festival at Shimoda, Japan, commemorating Commodore Matthew C. Perry's visit to Japan in 1854, the ship entered the Sumitomo Shipyard on 25 June for overhaul. Completing refresher training on 10 January 1974, the destroyer steamed to Pusan, Korea, for an ASW exercise with the South Korean Navy. Working with South Korean Warships, Bausell practiced tactical coordination and attack procedures against the submarine . For the next several months, the warship operated with the aircraft carrier , conducting carrier operations and type training, from the Philippines to the East China Sea. In May, she escorted an amphibious task force to the Coral Sea for exercises with British, Australian, Fijian, and New Zealand ships. Afterwards, on 18 June, she visited Mackay and Sydney, Australia, before returning to Yokosuka, via Subic Bay, on 21 July. In September, Bausell conducted ASW exercises with South Korean warships against Sailfish, and visited Sasebo and Hong Kong. She then served as planeguard for Constellation and took the time to shadow and gather intelligence on a Soviet cruiser. Following a month of upkeep at Yokosuka, the warship returned to the Yellow Sea in late November for more ASW exercises with the South Koreans. After a short period of screening duty with Midway, the destroyer returned to Yokosuka on 20 December. Bausell continued these types of local operations during the first three months of 1975. She conducted training exercises off Okinawa, visited ports in the Philippines and Taiwan, and screened 7th Fleet aircraft carriers. On 4 April, in company with Coral Sea, the destroyer began a cruise intended to reach into the Indian Ocean and to Australia. The communist advance on Saigon, however, diverted the warships to the Vietnamese coast on 11 April. During the ensuing Operation Frequent Wind, the destroyer screened other Navy ships as they evacuated Americans and South Vietnamese from the Saigon area. After steaming to Singapore for three days of upkeep and liberty, the task group resumed its cruise to Australia on 11 May. Two days later, the ships received orders to proceed to the Gulf of Siam to participate in the rescue of the hijacked American container ship . Bausell supported Coral Sea for the next five days as the carrier provided air support and cover for the marines on Koh Tang Island. In the wake of Mayaguezs release, the task group finally made Australia, with Bausell mooring at Albany on 31 May. Following a week-long visit, the destroyer returned to Yokosuka, via the Philippines, on 22 June. Over the next six months, the warship confined her operations to the waters around Japan. These included refresher training, escort services with Midway, and participation in Exercise \\"Tae Kwon Do IX\\" with elements of the South Korean Navy. The destroyer steamed near Honshū and Hokkaidō in the first two months of 1976, providing escort services for 7th Fleet carriers, before conducting ASW exercises with Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) warships. Similar operations out of Yokosuka occupied her until October when Bausell and Midway embarked on a two-week circumnavigation of Japan. The transit of the Sea of Japan provoked numerous overflights by Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 Bear D bombers; and, for several days, a Soviet Kanin-class guided missile destroyer shadowed the task group. On 10 November Bausell began a six- week drydock and repair period at Yokosuka, during which it was determined she would return to the United States the following year for retirement. More than a year of service remained to the destroyer, however, and the warship resumed operations out of Yokosuka in January 1977. These included carrier task force operations in February and March, during which Bausell drew the task of shouldering a persistent Soviet Krivak-class destroyer away from Midway, and more ASW exercises with South Korean and Japanese warships. In June, she participated in \\"Dolphinex 1-77\\", an ASW exercise with units of the Philippine Navy. In July, the destroyer made one last visit to Korea and, after a short cruise to the Philippines early in September, Bausell made final preparations at Yokosuka to return to the United States. Bausell as a target ship of the Pacific Missile Test Center, 1982 On 26 October, the destroyer left Japan for her last long voyage. She stopped for liberty calls at Keelung, Bangkok, Singapore, and Rabaul, before putting in at Sydney, Australia in late November. After a brief stop at Auckland, the warship pressed on, stopping at Tonga, Fiji, and Pago Pago, American Samoa, before arriving in Hawaii on 31 January 1978. The last leg of the voyage was completed when the warship finally returned to San Diego on 13 February. The destroyer underwent several inspections before entering fleet standdown status on 15 March. Notified in late March that she would not be sold to a foreign navy, the reduced crew began more drastic inactivation procedures. Bausell was decommissioned on 30 May 1978, and her name was struck from the Navy List that same day. She was transferred to the Pacific Missile Test Center for use in the Harpoon missile development program and was finally sunk as a target on 17 July 1987. ==Awards== Bausell received nine battle stars for Vietnam War service. Combat Action Ribbon, Meritorious Unit Commendation With One Star, Battle Efficiency \\"E\\", China Service Medal, National Defense Service medal With One Star, Korean Service Medal, United nations Service Medal, Republic Of Korea Presidential Unit Citation, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with Silver Star, Vietnam Campaign Medal With Clasp.

It is owned and operated by Gulf Ridge Council. Many camp legends are part of the lore, including the story of Tad Stoler, the haunting of campsite 14, and the sightings of Hcom Nala. ====Facilities==== In 1965 the Florida Gulf Coast Railroad donated the land that is now called Flaming Arrow Scout Reservation. Its first ranger, Don Prior, moved from Indiana with his family, wife and two young children-Bradly and Timmie. The family worked together with the council to develop the north side of the camp, Hampton. When a group comes to Flaming Arrow for longer than a day, they can stay overnight at one of the FASR's campsites. During the Summer Camp program, troops stay in either semi-permanent or cabin-style bunkhouses. The cabanas are located on Jenkins side of camp (the south side) in campsites Arapaho, Blackfoot and Cheyenne. These and the rest of the campsites use canvas wall tents erected on concrete platforms. On Jenkins side the remaining campsites are Dakota, Fox, Gosuite, and Hopi, the largest campsite. The rest of the campsites are on Hampton side (North side). These sites are Baden Powell, Beard, Seton, West, Boyce, Livingston, Tad Stoler, and the Outpost Campsite (previously known as Site 14). The Outpost campsite is the farthest site from the rest of camp. It also has no bathhouses, though it does have running water. (The outpost camp is now under renovations by Troop and Crew 123 to become the new \\"Mountain Man\\" site.) Livingston was closed because of its out dated facilities on top of hurricane damage, and spider infestation. (Beware of Fred Livingston!) Boyce is haunted and is never used; having burned down and overgrown. All the campsites in the main part of camp have flushing toilets, hot water showers, running water, and a pavilion. Many campsite pairs share a bath house (example: Cheyenne and Dakota, Beard and Seton). There is electricity in every occupied campsite. This includes lighting in all the cabanas, pavilions and bathhouses as well as electrical plugs. There are plans to have a plug for each tent in the near future as well as three new shared bathhouses. For many campers and Scoutmasters the biggest break in the day is the three meals served in the dining hall, Wood Hall. Wood Hall is located near the center of camp overlooking Swim Lake from the northeast corner of the lake. Wood Hall seats nearly three hundred occupants and is air conditioned. Jenkins Hall is located south of Wood Hall, at the end of the road leading into camp from the parking lot. Jenkins houses the camp Trading Post, concession stand and movie theater. The main room of Jenkins has a projector and a surround sound home theater system allowing troops to watch movies. The room is used by the Sports, Aquatics, Eagle Trail and other program areas to show instructional videos. Jenkins Hall is air conditioned and has a secure wireless internet connection. ====Program==== FASR offers several types of camping and instructional programs throughout the year. The most prominent is the Boy Scout Summer Camp. Troops spend a week starting on Sunday afternoon and leaving Saturday morning. During this week, they attend classes to earn merit badges, rank advancement, and other skills. Troops only stay for one week, but multiple Summer Camp weeks are offered starting in mid- June and ending mid-July. With the success of the Summer Camp program, FASR also offers an annual Winter Camp. It is less than a week long and occurs between Christmas and New Year's Eve. As with summer camp, Troops spend the \\"week\\" earning advancements. During the year, Troops can also choose to attend two Mini-Camps, where Scouts can earn a merit badge in a weekend. Flaming Arrow facilitates other events as well. Boy Scout Troops, The Order of the Arrow, and many groups and organizations other than Scouting use the camp throughout the year to facilitate their own activities and programs. ====Program areas==== Flaming Arrow contains several Program Areas for most of the activities offered at the camp. Aquatics The Aquatics Area is located in three areas around two of the lakes. The Swimming Area is on the north end of Swim Lake near Wood Hall. Swimming and Lifesaving merit badges as well as BSA Lifeguard certification are taught at this location. Adults can be trained in Aquatic Supervision. For those needing a greater challenge, there is the Mile Swim and the Three Mile Challenge. The Boating Area is located towards the southeast end of Swim Lake near Jenkins Hall. Here campers can earn Canoeing, Rowing, Motorboating, and Small Boat Sailing and the new Kayaking merit badges. A patch can also be earned in Boardsailing. Ski Lake is located on the Northwest corner of the property. This lake is entirely devoted to Water Sports merit badge. Although not run by the Aquatics Area, Flaming Arrow offers PADI scuba certification, which is taught in buildings and practiced in Swim Lake. Arts and sciences The Arts and Sciences building is located just west of \\"Four Corners\\" in the log cabin. Merit badges offered in Arts and Sciences include: Music, Theatre, Chemistry, Law, Medicine, Photography, and Space Exploration. New this year are Archeology and Pottery. Climbing Although the central monument of the climbing area is the thirty foot artificial face rock wall and the forty foot illuminated rappelling tower, the Climbing Area offers many sports merit badges along with Climbing merit badge. Some of the other badges offered are Golf, Personal Fitness (Eagle Required), and new this year, Skating. June 2009 FASR opened the new COPE course. Popular with JROTC units, this course does not sit idle. Ten low elements for team building, and eight high ropes elements to encourage individual confidence. Eagle Trail ====Hurricane Charley==== In 2004, Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances, and Hurricane Jeanne passed over Flaming Arrow causing damage to many areas of the camp. Surprisingly, almost all of the damage was vegetation loss. Staff and volunteers spent months clearing fallen trees from roads, paths, campsites, and program areas. The Aquatics area was hit the hardest, with no protection from the winds coming across the lakes. The Swimming Area main structure was completely destroyed and the Ski Area Boat House was lost. Around camp flooding was a major problem, as well as other structural damage. Saunders Hall, the original office building had several inches of water inside the building for over a month. Access to the shooting ranges also became limited when Staff City Field flooded. Summer Camp continued as normal in 2005 after months of repair and cleanup. However, nothing could be done about the high lake levels and the existence of new lakes; Staff City Field was now being called Staff City Lake. Summer of 2005 brought record levels of rain fall to the central Florida area. The effects at Flaming Arrow were a dramatic increase in lake level, and massive flooding over the rest of camp. In the Shooting Sports Area, roads and ranges were flooded and eventually closed or relocated. As \\"Staff City Lake\\" rose, it eventually overflowed into the Outdoor Skills area, flooding and closing the area. It was relocated to the unused campsite Erie. Within weeks of the start of Summer Camp, Saunders Hall remained flooded. It reopened in Summer 2007 with some repairs. Throughout the rest of camp, road and trail flooding was a major problem, especially right after a storm. One large section of road in front of the original Outdoor Skills area became permanently flooded as part of Staff City Lake. As the main lakes in camp rose to record levels, low lying areas became flooded. The Aquatics Area was able to deal with the rise of lake levels. Tests showed increased levels of bacteria from the flow of water, and the Swimming Area was closed for the rest of Summer Camp. The Boating and Ski Areas were also closed temporarily. In Week 5 of summer camp, Hopi was closed after all routes to and from the site became flooded. The main route to Hopi is a causeway between Swim Lake and Fish Lake. Historically, this passage has only flooded briefly after major storms. In early June, the lake levels rose high enough to not only connect Fish Lake and Swim Lake, but to also connect Swim Lake and Ski Lake. In addition, the now massive \\"Sw-ish-ski Lake\\" was also connected to the nearby Saddle Bag Lake, which is located off-property. This flooding persisted to almost winter and destroyed much of the original landscape. To date almost all of the pine trees that existed in the flood waters have died, as well as many other trees and plants. Camp has since recovered and the flooding has passed. Many cypress and pine trees have been planted to repopulate the area. ===Other Camps and Properties=== The other camps within the Gulf Ridge Council include Camp Alafia with 550 acres of primitive camping located in Lithia, Florida just 30 minutes southeast of Tampa, Camp Brorein a 64 acre weekend camping facility located in Odessa, Florida just 30 minutes northwest of Tampa. ==Seminole Lodge== Seminole Lodge is an Order of the Arrow lodge associated with the Gulf Ridge Council, located in west-central Florida. Members of the lodge belong to the Order of the Arrow, a national scouting honor society. Chartered in 1936 while under the name Kiondashama, the lodge name was changed to Seminole by September, 1938. Seminole is the name of a Native American people whose original homelands included portions of Florida. By 2007, the most recent year figures are available, the membership of the Seminole Lodge numbered 635. In 2016, after BSA National suggested a merge between Gulf Ridge and West Central Florida Councils, the lodges proceeded to merge as well. In late August, the Lodge Executive Council merger committee released the new lodge name and totem. The new name is Uh-To-Yeh-Hut-Tee, \\"lightning\\" in Seminole. The totem is a Florida Cracker Bull, selected for the importance of the affect the introduction of cattle had upon the people, industry, and culture of the Tampa Bay area. ==References== Category:Defunct local councils of the Boy Scouts of America ","title":"Gulf Ridge Council"},{"id":"7777558","text":"Hornungia alpina (also Hutchinsia alpina or Pritzelago alpina) is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.

It was originally published in 1938 in the United Kingdom by Heinemann, London and in the United States by Doubleday, New York. It is the tenth novel in the Albert Campion series. ==Plot introduction== Richard Portland-Smith disappeared without a trace three years ago – now Albert Campion has found his skeleton. The investigation of his suicide leads to Portland-Smith's former fiancee, the actress Georgia Wells, and to a series of deaths, apparently caused by \\"the hand of fate\\", but always in Georgia's interest. But Campion's involvement is more than just professional – this case involves his sister Valentine, Georgia's best friend. ==Plot summary== Campion asks his sister, fashion designer Valentine Ferris, to introduce him to her best friend and most important client, Georgia Wells, a famous actress. Campion has been investigating the disappearance of Georgia's former fiance, barrister Richard Portland-Smith, three years previously. Now Campion has found Portland-Smith's skeleton. Campion meets Georgia and her entourage, including her unpleasant, possibly dangerous husband Raymond Ramillies, at the unveiling of the costumes Val has made for Georgia's new play. He also meets Alan Dell, the man Val is in love with, who admits to an admiration for Georgia. The event ends in a fashion disaster when it emerges that the design for the main dress has been leaked and copied. The house model Caroline Adamson, chosen for her resemblance to Georgia, is responsible. Georgia knows about Portland-Smith's death but she is shocked when Campion tells her it was suicide, not murder – she asks Dell to drive her home instead of her husband Ramillies. Several weeks later, Val tells Campion that Georgia has stolen Dell from her. Besides admitting that she wants Georgia dead, she is worried that Ramillies has been behaving unpredictably and might attack Dell. Then Lady Amanda Fitton (Sweet Danger), who now works as an engineer at Dell's aircraft factory, asks for Campion's help to find out why Dell is neglecting his work. Campion takes her to a restaurant where they see Dell with Georgia. Ramillies arrives with Caroline Adamson, dressed up exactly like Georgia, to provoke a confrontation. But the situation is miraculously defused by various friends of those concerned – stage-managed by Georgia's manager, Ferdie Paul. To distract Dell from the embarrassing situation, Amanda tells him she is engaged to Campion – to Campion's surprise. Ramillies is due to return to Ulangi, the African colony of which he is governor, in a gold-painted plane, a gift to a local ruler. He is leaving from Caesar's Court, a luxury resort outside London, run by Gaiogi Laminoff. Ramilies disappears after an official dinner and does not return until the afternoon of the next day – he says he has been drinking all night. When the flight is due to take off, he cannot be found – he is eventually found dead in the plane. The officials attempt to smooth over his death and a doctor is ready to give a certificate that he died of natural causes, but then Georgia mentions that she gave him a painkiller to take which Val had given her for herself. When a post mortem is carried out there is no evidence of unnatural death. However, the rumour that Val tried to poison Georgia because they fell out over Alan Dell becomes widespread society gossip. Caroline Adamson contacts Campion with information but fails to turn up for their appointment. Then Stanislaus Oates calls Campion in to Scotland Yard – Caroline has been stabbed and her body dumped in the countryside. Sinclair, Georgia's young son, tells Campion and Amanda that Ramillies was actually terrified of flying, but that he knew of an injection which would make him feel ill for four hours, then feel fine for the flight. Campion thinks this is how he was killed. As the police close in on Val because of the painkiller story, Campion tracks down the men who dumped Caroline's body. They run a restaurant which provides accommodation for various criminal activities – they are not saying who killed Caroline and they have destroyed all the evidence. Amanda gives a party to celebrate breaking off her engagement to Campion – she is calm about it, but he seems upset. Campion tells everybody what he has found out – that Portland-Smith was blackmailed by Caroline and an accomplice until he killed himself, that Ramillies was given an unknown drug which killed him, and that Caroline was murdered when she tried to blackmail her former accomplice. Then he argues with Amanda, throws her in the river, and leaves. Alan Dell apologises to Val and asks her to marry him – she accepts. Campion visits Ferdie Paul and explains that the crimes were carried out for Georgia's sake. Ferdie Paul leaves for Caesar's Court to confront Gaiogi Laminoff, who he says is Georgia's father. A message asks Campion to follow, but on the way he is knocked out and taken to Amanda's cottage where he is placed with his head in the gas oven to fake his suicide. But at the vital moment, the police burst in – Campion has arranged in advance for them to follow him. Ferdie Paul is revealed as the man who tried to kill him, and he was also responsible for the other deaths. Campion recovers. Now that the fake engagement is over, Amanda asks for her ring back – Campion says he will marry her if she wants. ==Characters in \\"The Fashion in Shrouds\\"== * Albert Campion * Magersfontein Lugg, his \\"gentleman's gentleman\\", and ex-burglar * Valentine Ferris (Val), Campion's sister, a fashion designer * Marthe Papendeik (\\"Tante Marthe\\"), Val's employer, friend of Val and Campion's mother * Caroline Adamson, a model employed by Papendeik's * Georgia Wells, a famous actress * Raymond Ramillies, Georgia's husband, governor of a British colony in Africa * Sinclair, Georgia's son by a previous marriage. * Ferdie Paul, Georgia's manager and theatrical impresario * Anna Fitch, Ferdie Paul's mistress * Gaiogi Laminoff, manager of Caesar's Court * Alan Dell, aircraft designer * Lady Amanda Fitton, aircraft engineer employed by Dell, old friend of Campion * Stanislaus Oates, Scotland Yard inspector and friend of Campion == References == * Margery Allingham, The Fashion in Shrouds, (William Heinemann, 1938) * Margery Allingham, The Fashion in Shrouds, (Vintage, Random House, 2006) ==Sources, references, external links, quotations== *An Allingham bibliography, with dates and publishers, from the UK Margery Allingham Society *FASHION IN SHROUDS Plot summary from the UK Margery Allingham Society *Another plot summary Category:1938 British novels Category:Novels by Margery Allingham Category:Doubleday, Doran books Category:Heinemann (publisher) books ","title":"The Fashion in Shrouds"},{"id":"7777664","text":"Molve Molve (in Hungarian Molna) is a municipality in the Koprivnica–Križevci County in Croatia.

They are usually 4-stroke but 2-stroke versions were made. It was conceived in the late 19th century and produced by various companies from the 1890s through approximately the 1940s. The name comes from the speed control on these engines: they fire (\\"hit\\") only when operating at or below a set speed, and cycle without firing (\\"miss\\") when they exceed their set speed. This is as compared to the \\"throttle governed\\" method of speed control. The sound made when the engine is running without a load is a distinctive \\"Snort POP whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh snort POP\\" as the engine fires and then coasts until the speed decreases and it fires again to maintain its average speed. The snorting is caused by atmospheric intake valve used on many of these engines. Many engine manufacturers made hit-and-miss engines during their peak use—from approximately 1910 through the early 1930s when more modern designs began to replace them. Some of the largest engine manufacturers were Stover, Hercules, International Harvester (McCormick Deering), John Deere (Waterloo Engine Works), Maytag and Fairbanks Morse. == Construction == This is a video montage of the Otto engines running at the Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion (WMSTR), in Rollag, Minnesota. It is a type of hit-and-miss engine.(2min 16sec, 320x240, 340kbit/s video) A hit-and-miss engine is a type of flywheel engine.http://www.osagcd.com/FeaturedEngine.html A flywheel engine is an engine that has a large flywheel or set of flywheels connected to the crankshaft. The flywheels maintain engine speed during engine cycles that do not produce driving mechanical forces. The flywheels store energy on the combustion stroke and supply the stored energy to the mechanical load on the other three strokes of the piston. When these engines were designed, technology was less advanced and manufacturers made all parts very large. A typical engine weighs approximately 1000 pounds (454 kg). Typically, the material for all significant engine parts was cast iron. Small functional pieces were made of steel and machined to tolerance. The fuel system of a hit- and-miss engine consists of a fuel tank, fuel line, check valve and fuel mixer. The fuel tank most typically holds gasoline but many users started the engines with gasoline and then switched to a cheaper fuel, such as kerosene or diesel. The fuel line connects the fuel tank to the mixer. Along the fuel line, a check valve keeps the fuel from running back to the tank between combustion strokes. The mixer creates the correct fuel-air mixture by means of a needle valve attached to a weighted or spring-loaded piston usually in conjunction with an oil-damped dashpot. Mixer operation is simple, it contains only one moving part, that being the needle valve. While there are exceptions, a mixer doesn't store fuel in a bowl of any kind. Fuel is simply fed to the mixer, where due to the effect of Bernoulli's principle, it is self-metered in the venturi created below the weighted piston by the action of the attached needle valve, the method used to this day in the SU carburetor. Sparks to ignite the fuel mixture are created by either a spark plug or a device called an ignitor. When a spark plug is used, the spark was generated by either a magneto or else a trembler (or 'buzz') coil. A buzz coil uses battery power to generate a continuous series of high voltage pulses that are fed to the spark plug. For igniter ignition, either a battery and coil is used or a \\"low tension\\" magneto is used. With battery and coil ignition, a battery is wired in series with a wire coil and the igniter contacts. When the contacts of the ignitor are closed (the contacts reside inside the combustion chamber), electricity flows through the circuit. When the contacts are opened by the timing mechanism, a spark is generated across the contacts, which ignite the mixture. When a low tension magneto (really a low-voltage high-current generator) is used, the output of the magneto is fed directly to the igniter points and the spark is generated as with a battery and coil. Except for very large examples, lubrication was almost always manual. Main crankshaft bearings and the connecting rod bearing on the crankshaft generally has a grease cup—a small container (cup) filled with grease and a screwed-on cover. A typical engine oiler. This is one made by Lunkenheimer When the cover is screwed down tighter, grease is forced out of the bottom of the cup and into the bearing. Some early engines have just a hole in the bearing casting cap where an operator squirts lubricating oil while the engine is running. The piston is lubricated by a drip oiler that continuously feeds drips of oil onto the piston. The excess oil from the piston runs out of the cylinder onto the engine and eventually onto the ground. The drip oiler can be adjusted to drip faster or slower depending on the need for lubrication, dictated by how hard the engine is working. The rest of the moving engine components were all lubricated by oil that the engine operator had to apply periodically while the engine was running. Virtually all hit-and-miss engines are of the \\"open crank\\" style, that is, there is no enclosed crankcase. The crankshaft, connecting rod, camshaft, gears, governor, etc. are all completely exposed and can be viewed in operation when the engine is running. This makes for a messy environment as oil and sometimes grease are thrown from the engine as well as oil running onto the ground. Another disadvantage is that dirt and dust can get on all moving engine parts, causing excessive wear and engine malfunctions. Frequent cleaning of the engine is therefore required to keep it in proper operating condition. Cooling of the majority of hit-and-miss engines is by hopper cooling, with water in an open reservoir. There were a small portion of small and fractional horsepower engines that were air-cooled with the aid of an incorporated fan. The water-cooled engine has a built in reservoir (larger engines usually don't have a reservoir and require connection to a large external tank for cooling water via pipe connections on the cylinder). The water reservoir includes the area around the cylinder as well as the cylinder head (most cases) and a tank mounted or cast above the cylinder. When the engine runs it heats the water. Cooling is accomplished by the water steaming off and removing heat from the engine. When an engine runs under load for a period of time, it is common for the water in the reservoir to boil. Replacement of lost water is needed from time to time. A danger of the water- cooled design is freezing in cold weather. Many engines were ruined when a forgetful operator neglecting to drain the water when the engine was not in use, and the water froze and broke the cast iron engine pieces. However, New Holland patented a v-shaped reservoir, so that expanding ice pushed up and into a larger space rather than break the reservoir. Water jacket repairs are common on many of the engines that still exist. ==Design== These were simple engines compared to modern engine design. However, they incorporate some innovative designs in several areas, often in an attempt to circumvent patent infringement for a particular component. This is particularly true of the governor. Governors are centrifugal, swinging arm, pivot arm, and many others. The actuator mechanism to govern speed is also varied depending on patents existing and the governor used. See, for example, U.S. Patents 543,157Michael Lawrence Mery, \\"Explosive engine,\\" U.S. patent 543,157 (filed: Feb. 7, 1895 ; issued: July 23, 1895). from 1895 or 980,658Theodore C. Menges, \\"Speed- regulator for internal-combustion engines,\\" U.S. patent 980,658 (filed: Oct. 28, 1909 ; issued: Jan. 3, 1911). from 1911. However accomplished, the governor has one job - to control the speed of the engine. In modern engines, power output is controlled by throttling the flow of the air through the intake by means of a butterfly valve; the only exception to this being in diesels and Valvetronic petrol engines. ===How hit-and-miss engines work=== The intake valve on hit-and-miss engines has no actuator; instead, a light spring holds the intake valve closed unless a vacuum in the cylinder draws it open. This vacuum only occurs if the exhaust valve is closed during the piston's down-stroke. When the hit-and-miss engine is operating above its set speed, the governor holds the exhaust valve open, preventing a vacuum in the cylinder and causing the intake valve to remain closed, thus interrupting the Otto cycle firing mechanism. When the engine is operating at or below its set speed, the governor lets the exhaust valve close. On the next down-stroke, a vacuum in the cylinder opens the intake valve and lets the fuel-air mixture enter. This mechanism prevents fuel consumption during the intake stroke of \\"miss\\" cycles. A video explanation on the workings of a hit and miss engine can be found here ==Usage== A Jaeger trash pump used for pumping dirty (trashy) water. It has a Hercules 2½ HP (1.9 kW) engine. This is an example of an integrated function of hit-and-miss engines (i.e., not belted) Hit-and-miss engines produced power outputs from 1 through approximately 100 horsepower (0.75 - 75 kW). These engines run slowly—typically from 250 revolutions per minute (rpm) for large horsepower engines to 600 rpm for small horsepower engines. They powered pumps for cultivation, saws for cutting wood, generators for electricity in rural areas, farm equipment, and many other stationary applications. Some were mounted on cement mixers. These engines also ran some early washing machines. They were a labour-saving device on farms, and helped farmers accomplish much more than they could previously. The engine was typically belted to the device being powered by a wide flat belt, typically from 2 - 6 inches (5 – 15 cm) wide. The flat belt was driven by a pulley on the engine that attached either to a flywheel or to the crankshaft. The pulley was specially made to have a circumference slightly tapered from the middle to each edge (like an over-inflated car tyre) so that the middle of the pulley was a slightly larger diameter. This kept the flat belt in the centre of the pulley. ==Replacement with throttle-governed engines== By the 1930s, more- advanced engines became common. Flywheel engines were and remain extremely heavy for the power produced, and run at very slow speeds. Older engines required a lot of maintenance and were not easily incorporated into mobile applications. In the late 1920s, International Harvester already had the model M engine, which was an enclosed version of a flywheel engine. Their next step was the model LA, which was a totally enclosed engine (except for the valve system) featuring self-lubrication (oil in the crankcase), reliable spark plug ignition, faster-speed operation (up to about 750-800 RPM) and most of all, light in weight compared to earlier generations. While the 1½ HP (1.1 kW) model LA still weighed about 150 pounds (68 kg), it was far lighter than the model M 1½ HP engine, which is in the 300-350 pound (136 – 159 kg) range. Later a slightly improved LA, the LB was produced. The models M, LA and LB are throttle governed. As time passed, more engine manufacturers moved to the enclosed crankcase engine. Companies like Briggs and Stratton were also producing lightweight air-cooled engines in the 1/2 to 2 HP (.37 - 1.5 kW) range and used much lighter-weight materials. These engines also run at much higher speeds (up to approximately 2,000-4,000 RPM) and therefore produce more power for a given size than slow flywheel engines. Most flywheel engine production ceased in the 1940s, but modern engines of this kind remain in use for applications where the low speed is desirable, mostly in oil field applications such as pumpjacks. Maintenance is less of a problem with modern flywheel engines than older ones due to their enclosed crankcases and more advanced materials. ==Preservation== Thousands of out-of-use flywheel engines were scrapped in the iron and steel drives of World War II—but many survived and have been restored to working order by enthusiasts. However, in recent years engines with original paint have become more desirable to many collectors than repainted engines. Numerous preserved hit-and-miss engines may be seen in action at shows dedicated to antique engines (who often also have antique tractors) as well as in the stationary engine section of steam fairs and vintage vehicle rallies. ==References== * ==External links== * Harry's Old Engine \\"Antique gas engine collection\\" - a wide variety of hit-and-miss engine manuals (different makes, different uses), each with a detailed, illustrated description page, some including audio clips of the engines running * Video of a 6hp Root & Vandervoort Hit & Miss Engine * Description of Novo 6HP engine (manufactured in Lansing Michigan) with video showing engine in operation * Description of a Fairbanks Jack-of-all-trades engine * Description of a Jaeger 2HP engine * Description of a Reid 15HP engine * Video of large hit-and-miss engine * Video of small hit-and-miss engine * \\"International Harvester Famous 3 Horsepower Hit-Miss Engine\\" – Description of International Harvester Famous 3 Horsepower Hit-Miss Engine * Gas Engine Magazine (features) – Enthusiast's magazine covering the history and preservation of hit-and-miss engines Category:Engine technology Category:Stationary engines Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Hit-and-miss engine"},{"id":"7777705","text":"Podravske Sesvete is a municipality in the Koprivnica–Križevci County in Croatia.

The site is called \\"Laguna de los Condores\\" because the people that found the lagoon would see these birds soar near the lagoon and it also obtained the name \\" Laguna de las Momias\\" because of the findings of the mummies around the area. The Chachapoyas were an old civilization that was located in the northern forest in the time of 900 a.c. This culture had been unknown by archaeologist for hundreds of years until the mummies appeared. It contains many mausoleums that occupy a natural cave of difficult access, sculpted in the wall of a craggy rock that emerges of a lagoon. Each funeral deposit is constituted by a mummy in seated position, wrapped in both flat and decorated textiles. In the lake of the mummies there were ceramics and other artifacts found that are traced back to the Incas. When excavating the lake of the Mummies in group one there were six mausoleums found each consisting of cubed shaped enclosures placed right next to each other in a row. The tombs were housed in caves that contained paintings on the walls that were related to the mausoleums and contained symbols that were indecipherable. The enclosures were built with only three walls the fourth being the rock wall. The enclosures had two floors and on the top level a window was found. The purpose of the window was to renew the air to prevent the mummies to corrupt by the moisture. The mummies found in the tomb were placed in a seating position. The mummies have unique coffins that contain a human faced stitched on it. Based on the size of the funeral it appears that they were of small creatures. The mummification process of the tombs were done with sophisticated techniques in order to preserve the bodies due to high humidity in the Amazon Andes. In the tombs there were various cultural objects found such as pottery, textiles, wood carvings the size of statues, clothing, silver, personal ornaments, and even ceremonial objects used in their rituals. The mausoleums of the Lagoon of the Mummies were still replete with funeral deposits, approximately two hundred. In the mausoleums personages were buried of high rank and. During Inca domination of the region, there were officials from Cuzco, the Inca capital, who resided in Cochabamba. Although the robbers were later arrested, the end result was that many of these mummies were destroyed and others damaged. In 1997, a survey of the damage was taken by archaeologist Peter Lerche on the behalf of Peru's National Institute of Culture. There was an initial estimation of around 70 mummies to have been present on the cliff edge (it was later discovered that there was actually over 200 bundles of mummies). Later salvaging revealed that there were others who had damaged the site other than the ones who initially hacked into the tombs and stole artifacts. These were caused by tourists and looters over time visiting the cliff, moving mummies to take pictures as well as taking artifacts as souvenirs. Due to the mummies being moved around, many of them were damaged, with some of them even exposed to the rain, completely decaying them. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Amazonas Region Category:Archaeological sites in Peru ","title":"Laguna de las Momias"},{"id":"7777712","text":"Lobería Partido is a partido on the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina.

His mother, Louise-Philippe Chartier de Lotbinière (1690-1725), was the daughter of René-Louis Chartier de Lotbinière. He was godson of his mother's first cousin, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, and he himself was a first cousin of Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière. After completing his studies at the Séminaire de Québec, he was ordained priest in 1734 and appointed pastor of Saint-Pierre-d'Orléans, which also included duties at Saint-Laurent in L'Arbre-Sec. After thirty-five years of humble ministry, he was called to the episcopate and consecrated coadjutor of Quebec, 12 July 1772, the first native of Canada to attain to the dignity of bishop. The Lotbinière family had lobbied the governor, and Bishop Briand thought it best to agree even though his proposed successor was older than he and deaf. While accepting the position, Esgly chose to remain parish priest at St. Pierre. In 1775 he made a pastoral visit to the other parishes on the Île d'Orléans. On the resignation of Bishop Briand, he succeeded to the See of Quebec 29 November 1784, but continued to serve as pastor at St. Pierre.Scott, Henry Arthur. \\"Archdiocese of Quebec.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 21 February 2019 One of his first acts was to appoint his vicars general for the vast diocese. He confirmed Henri- François Gravé de La Rive at Quebec, Pierre Garreau at Trois-Rivières, and Étienne Montgolfier at Montreal,Pelletier, Jean-Guy. “Mariauchau d’Esgly, Louis-Philippe”, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 4, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003 while he oversaw things from Saint- Pierre-d'Orléans. In his first pastoral letter he alludes to the appointment of a coadjutor, a precaution justified by age, infirmity, and the necessity of securing a successor. Bishop Jean-François Hubert, who was a missioner at Notre-Dame-de l’Assomption near Detroit at the time, was nominated coadjutor that same year, but the approval of the British Government was withheld till 1786. The main question that concerned him was the lack of priests. Bishop d'Esglis tried unsuccessfully to supply the dearth of clergy by obtaining priests from France. The British Government preferred the emigration of priests for the settlements in Upper Canada and the Maritime Provinces. Pending the arrival of a missionary for the Acadians, a layman was authorized to baptize and witness marriage contracts. Acadians settled in the maritime provinces and confirmed Joseph-Mathurin Bourg as Vicar-General for that area. Fathers Girouard, Le Roux, and Donat, of the congregation of the Holy Ghost served there, while the Irish and Scotch Catholics of the same region were attended by the Abbé Phelan and Capuchin James Jones, who resided at Halifax. Bishop John Butler of Cork sent some priests, recruited by the Irish Father Thomas Hussey, representative of the Diocese of Quebec in London. In 1787, Bishop d'Esglis issued a pastoral letter to all the faithful of the lower provinces, exhorting them to union and steadfastness in the Faith. He died 4 June 1788 in the fifty-fifth year of his priesthood and was buried at Saint- Pierre. In 1969, his remains were transferred to the crypt of the basilica of Notre-Dame in Quebec. == See also == * Joseph-Laurent Bertrand ==References== ==Sources== * Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Category:Roman Catholic Bishops of Quebec Category:18th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:1710 births Category:1788 deaths Category:Burials at Notre- Dame de Québec Cathedral ","title":"Louis-Philippe Mariauchau d'Esgly"},{"id":"7777787","text":"The Brooklyn-based band Company consists of three songwriters and a dynamic drummer. They perform folk- and country-based songs with punk and psychedelic rock energy to create a sound that defies ready categories. Company’s members met at Bard College, where they collaborated in a variety of punk groups and folk ensembles. After moving to Brooklyn, they formed the band in 2001 as a way of weaving together these distinct musical threads, reworking their acoustically conceived songs and adding improvisational elements and post-punk dynamics to the mix. The resulting songs range from punk-country ballads to intimate folkish mediations to psychedelic epics, but the lyric always remains the focus; the vocal commands the foreground while lush harmonies, psych- inflected guitars, and David Janik's powerful rhythms, drive it forward. Years of modest but consistent shows in small venues like the now-defunct Nine-C Lounge in Manhattan's East Village and the intimate Pete's Candy Store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, earned Company a small but loyal following. In this early period, they recorded two studio albums, which remain unreleased, as well as a live album captured at an early Nine-C show. In 2004, they self- released their third record, Hills (recorded by former Oakley Hall drummer Will Dyar). Next, they recorded their fourth, Parallel Time, at the rural Kentucky studio of Paul Oldham, and Oneida's Brah Records picked it up for release in October 2005. Their second CD on Brah, Old Baby, released in February 2008, was produced by Kid Millions of Oneida.

Under DSB's 'Good trains for everyone' plan ('Gode tog til alle'), the intent of the IC4 project was to replace several types of outdated rolling stock. However, various delays and shortcomings have turned the project into a major political issue. The IC4 units were originally scheduled to enter DSB's Intercity service in 2003. On 25 June 2007, one IC4 unit (trainset no. 4) entered regional service between Aarhus and Aalborg. On 27 August 2007, another test train entered regional passenger service between Aarhus and Fredericia in eastern Jutland. Two further units entered regional service during the autumn of 2007. By the end of 2007, DSB and AnsaldoBreda were to agree when the IC4 would be ready for Intercity and IntercityLyn (express inter-city) services. This, however, required the approval of the Danish National Rail Authority. The IC4's first long-distance run, from Aalborg to Copenhagen, took place on 7 August 2008, while the train finally received approval for regular service with multiple connected trainsets on 9 November 2010.Typegodkendelse til IC4 er i hus (in Danish) The 82nd and final unit (MG 5683) was delivered to DSB in September 2013, and as of 2015, IC4 trains are in regular operation on the Aarhus- Copenhagen, Aarhus-Aalborg, Aarhus-Esbjerg, Odense-Fredericia and Copenhagen- Holbæk-Kalundborg connections. ==Equipment and specifications== The train is powered by four low-emission diesel engines with a common rail direct- injection system, giving a total power output of (or 3045 metric hp). The engines are V8s from Iveco. The maximum allowed speed of the train is . Each train set consists of four articulated cars with a total length of , and is capable of seating 204 people. Built of light aluminium alloys, each trainset weighs , and a fully operational (including diesel, water, etc.) weight of . Up to four trainsets can be coupled together into a single train. However, there are problems associated with this configuration, so in the first instance it was decided to have the IC4 approved using one trainset only, with approval for multi-unit configurations to be sought later. Since a single trainset is too short for efficient long-distance operations, the first trains were used mainly for regional services. In December 2016, DSB gave up the efforts to connect four trainsets.https://ing.dk/artikel/dsb-lader-pendlerne- bumle-otte-aar-mere-ukomfortable-ic4-tog-190286 ==Design== The design of the train is the outcome of cooperation between DSB's own designers, with an emphasis on Nordic minimalist design, and the Italian design company Pininfarina (famous for designing Ferrari cars) emphasizing Italian chic and curved lines. Externally, the bullet-shaped extremities at each end of the trainset—which are familiar from high-speed trains throughout Europe—represent a break with the design of the IC3 train, whose passengers are able to cross over between trainsets. The train interior features natural materials consistent with Scandinavia's design tradition, an audio/video information system with seat reservation displays, and a lounge area. ==Controversy== The IC4 train has become a contentious issue in Danish politics, mainly because of the long delays in AnsaldoBreda’s delivery of the trains. The Danish Minister of Traffic and Energy is routinely required to submit progress updates to parliament, and DSB's choice of a heavily customised train is often criticised as being the major reason for the delays. The expense involved in lengthening the platforms of several stations along the IC4 routes is the source of much additional criticism. In November 2006,Formaliteter bremser de nye IC4-tog (dr.dk) it was revealed that the trains appeared to be working properly, but that the formal documentation requirements of the safety authorities were preventing the train from entering service fully. By the end of October 2007, four IC4 units had entered regional service in Jutland. However, service was suspended at the end of February 2008 because of problems with exhaust fumes. There have been many faults that did not really prevent the train from being used, but were still unacceptable, such as spurious warnings and various other computer-related problems. ==Ultimatum== In June 2008, DSB gave AnsaldoBreda an ultimatum whereby at least 14 trains had to be approved and ready for regular service before May 2009; otherwise, the contract would be cancelled and DSB would demand its money back and return its trains to the factory. DSB had ordered a total of 83 IC4 trainsets in 2000, with delivery originally scheduled for 2003. On 7 August 2008, train no. 13 completed a return trip from Aarhus H. to Copenhagen H. with passengers aboard. On 21 May 2009, it became clear that the ultimatum had been met, with 15 trains having been delivered, although a subclause condition stating that at least one trainset should have been tested and approved for coupling to other units had not yet been met. ==Current situation== Along with the (partial) fulfilment of the ultimatum, DSB also announced it had reached an agreement with AnsaldoBreda concerning delivery of the remaining trainsets. The final delivery date would be extended to 2012. AnsaldoBreda would drop all further development, and all subsequent trainsets would be identical to the current test train. All final updates would be performed by DSB. AnsaldoBreda was to pay DSB compensation of DKK 2 billion, which, together with the previously paid compensation fees, will ultimately entail refunding half the original value of the contract. DSB reserved the right to cancel the contract if more than seven trains were delivered over six months late. DSB is suffering from a shortage of trainsets and reliability problems with the current trainsets, since the existing IC3s are old and require replacement. Ordering new IC3s would be 'expensive and technically challenging', according to DSB. DSB, in cooperation with Deutsche Bahn, has started using German tilting ICE-TD diesel trains to and from Germany.http://ft.dk/samling/20081/almdel/TRU/bilag/26/600876.pdf This has relieved the situation somewhat, despite the high cost of these trains and the expense of adapting them for Danish traffic. In October 2008, DSB also ordered 45 new double-decker coaches from Bombardier, to be delivered from the end of 2009 onwards. From August 2009, DSB was running 17 scheduled trains daily using the IC4. However, DSB was using only single IC4 sets, not multiple connected sets, limiting their utility.Nu 17 afgange med IC4-tog This is because they could not be used during rush hours, as longer trains are needed at those times. On 9 November 2010, after a seven-year delay, DSB finally completed the certification process for multiple connected IC4 trainsets. These were scheduled to enter service in January 2011. At the end April 2011, DSB's director, Frank Olesen, stated that further economic sanctions against AnsaldoBreda were likely to be imposed as a result of continuing problems with the quality of the trains delivered. These problems had caused the trains to have to be upgraded to Danish standards at DSB's own expense at its facility in Randers. Eighteen IC4 trains had been approved for operation, nine of them then being in daily service.Jesper Olesen, \\"DSB har flere IC4-trængsler\\", Jyllands-Posten, 30 April 2011. In November 2011, two IC4 trains failed to stop at stop signals. This caused Trafikstyrelsen (the Transportation Authority) to prohibit the IC4 from running until the problems had been fully investigated.DSB stopper al kørsel med IC4 (in Danish) On 2 July 2012, the DSB announced that the Transportation Authority had approved Denmark's railway operator to put back into operation the fleet of 37 IC4s which had been withdrawn from service in November 2011. DSB: IC4 in servizio On 18 December 2012 an agreement was reached between AnsaldoBreda and Danish railways to solve the problems.. Retrieved on 2013-06-07. The 82nd and final unit (MG 5683) was delivered to DSB in September, 2013. As of 2014, IC4 trains are in regular operation between Aarhus and Copenhagen, Aarhus-Aalborg, Aarhus- Esbjerg and Copenhagen-Kalundborg. The two-car IC2 version is also in service on some regional services in Jutland, e.g., Kolding-Vejle. Concerns about reliability remain, however, especially after the failure of an IC4 trainset in the Great Belt tunnel on February 24, 2014 and the consequent evacuation of 191 passengers to another trainset. In September 2014 an investigation by the Danish Department of Transport was launched to find whether it was more economical to have the delivered trains scrapped or have them rebuilt for slower regional traffic. Scrapping the trains could lead to DSB filing for bankruptcy. It was announced on 15 December 2016 that the troubled fleet would be phased out from 2024. On 2 January 2019 two units were damaged, at least one of them unrepairably, in the Great Belt Bridge rail accident. In July 2020, DSB offered 11 of them for sale. ==Libyan trainset== In March 2013, as well as in earlier media reports, it was reported that one of the missing IC4 trainsets planned for delivery in Denmark had been found in Libya. Reportedly, AnsaldoBreda and the then Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi gave Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi the trainset as a present in 2009 on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Gaddafi's accession to power.IC4 train a gift from Berlusconi to GadaffiDSB: Vi aner intet om Gadaffi-tog Retrieved on 2013-03-21 It is visible on Google Maps satellite (at ) and geotagged photos.https://www.panoramio.com/photo/44127207 A DR film crew visited the site of the train in question in March 2013.https://ing.dk/artikel/anders- lund-madsens-udsendte-opsporer-gadaffis-slidte-ic4-i-oerkenen-157347 == Gallery == File:IC4 cap view.JPGCab view (unit 5632) File:IC4 exterior green.JPG DSB logo in dark blue and entry doors partially in green (unit 5639) File:IC4 exterior red.JPGDSB logo and entry doors partially in red (unit 5653) File:IC4 bogie.JPGID from the vehicle register and part of a Jacobs bogie File:IC4 HVAC.JPGHVAC seen from above File:IC4 interior 2.JPG32-seat compartment File:IC4 interior 3.JPGBistro File:IC4 interior 4.JPGLow-floor coach – Toilet compartment File:IC4 interior 6.JPGLow-floor coach - Space for a wheelchair File:IC4 interior 5.JPGLuggage area at each end of the MG units File:Detaliu IC4 in culorile Astra Trans Carpatic , Bucuresti ,Gara de Nord.jpgASTRA Trans Carpatic IC2 ==See also== * List of high-speed trains == References == ==External links== *Pictures of the train on the DSB website (in Danish) Category:DSB multiple units Category:Multiple units of Denmark Category:AnsaldoBreda multiple units Category:Articulated passenger trains Category:Passenger trains running at least at 200 km/h in commercial operations ","title":"IC4"},{"id":"7777824","text":"Bernard Bamford Calvert (16 September 1942) is an English musician who played bass guitar and keyboards with The Hollies from 1966 until 1981. ==Career== He worked with several rock and roll groups during the early 1960s, most notably Rickie Shaw and the Dolphins, where he worked with future Hollies members, Tony Hicks and Bobby Elliott. Originally a pianist, Calvert, on Hicks's suggestion, switched to bass. After the break-up of the Dolphins, Calvert played in a number of semi-professional outfits. However, unable to advance his musical career, Calvert took a factory job until he was asked to substitute for Hollies' then bassist, Eric Haydock, in a tour of Scandinavia. After the tour, Calvert played on an Everly Brothers album, and on the Hollies' single, \\"Bus Stop\\", before returning to his factory job. Shortly after that, he was invited to join the Hollies permanently in 1966. Calvert was friends with Mama Cass Elliot from The Mamas & the Papas. ==Bass Guitars == Fender Precision After Eric Haydock left the band, Calvert was asked to replace him, and when he first joined The Hollies, his first choice of the electric bass was the Fender Precision Bass. The Fender Precision was an early model, still fitted with pickup and bridge covers. Calvert can be seen using this bass in his early years with the band, from 1966 to early 1967. But this particular model of the electric bass would resurface in 1969 where numerous recordings and live performances included this bass, and Calvert used this bass until his departure in 1980. Fender Jazz After the Fender Precision Bass, Calvert moved to a more versatile model of Fender Basses, the Jazz Bass. Similarly to the Fender Precision Bass, it is an early model, still fitted with pickup and bridge covers. Calvert would acquire this model of the electric bass in early-1967, and would use this bass guitar extensively in 1968, until his Fender Precision resurfaced in 1969. Some songs that included the Jazz Bass would be as notable as On A Carousel, Carrie-Anne, King Midas in Reverse, and so on. Rickenbacker 4000 In the early 1970s, around 70' or 71', Calvert purchased and acquired a Rickenbacker 4000 bass. The Rickenbacker 4000 bass was an early model in the bass catalog of Rickenbacker, it was a simple bass, with only one pickup located at the bridge. The distinct tone of the Rickenbacker helped Calvert throughout the 70s in recording and performing. Though he would perform more often with the Precision, his Rickenbacker would be heard the most in 70s recording such as the Distant Light album. Calvert would stick to this bass until his departure from the band. ==Honors == On 24 September 2009, the Hollies were nominated for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and on 18 December 2009 were announced as inductees, to be inducted on 15 March 2010.

The SH-201 was discontinued in 2010. At the NAMM 2010 show Roland introduced its successor, the Roland SH-01 Gaia. ==Features== The SH-201 is equipped with two analogue modeling oscillators (four when in Dual or Split mode), a multi-mode filter, ring modulator, and it allows routing an external audio signal into its own dedicated filter. Real-time controls feature 29 front panel knobs and sliders, assignable pitch/mod stick and Roland's infrared D-Beam controller. The synthesizer also acts as a USB audio interface for digital audio workstation recording. The modeling and layout of filters, envelopes, oscillator types, and mix options are similar to the JP-8000. Notable differences are that the SH-201 offers more polyphony, oscillator choices, LFO routings and comes with computer software for more in-depth sound editing, patch librarian storage and DAW integration. The name SH-201 is derived from Roland's classic SH line of analog synthesizers, all of which were designed to be portable and simple to program, while the number 201 was chosen to reference the popular SH-101 which was also cased in plastic. It is also fully Windows and Mac compatible, connecting through a USB cable. MIDI and audio can be sent through the USB port.http://www.roland.com/products/en/SH-201/ ==Notable users== * Hadouken! * Abandon All Ships * Bozon Higgs * Calvin Harris (notable for the main synth hook in \\"I'm Not Alone\\") * Disclosure * Scissor Sisters * Richard Barbieri * Noisia * Front 242 * The Neon Judgement * Suicide Commando * Insect Graveyard * Marcus Brown (Madonna) * Printz Board * Scooter (Just on stage) * JMR * Joker * Jean Michel JarreTéo & Téa CD booklet * Ladytron * Asia (band) * Geoff Downes * Milk Inc. * Timbaland * Jamie Cullum * Kaiser Chiefs * Walk the Moon * Grimes * Alan Walker (used for live performances) == References == ==Further reading== * ==External links== * SH-201 details - VintageSynth.com * Roland US - official site * Musicradar review * EMusician review SH-201 Category:D-Beam Category:Virtual analog synthesizers Category:Polyphonic synthesizers Category:Digital synthesizers ","title":"Roland SH-201"},{"id":"7777828","text":"Bloodlust is the debut studio album by deathcore band Through the Eyes of the Dead.
