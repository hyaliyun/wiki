Size: 1.5√ó1.5√ó0.3 cm. A carbonate fluoride, fluoride carbonate, fluorocarbonate or fluocarbonate is a double salt containing both carbonate and fluoride. The salts are usually insoluble in water, can can have more than one kind of metal cation to make more complex compounds. Rare-earth fluorocarbonates are particularly important as ore minerals for the light rare-earth elements lanthanum, cerium and neodymium. Bastn√§site is the most important source of these elements. Other artificial compounds are under investigation as non-linear optical materials and for transparency in the ultraviolet, with effects over a dozen times greater than Potassium dideuterium phosphate. Related to this there are also chlorocarbonates and bromocarbonates. Along with these fluorocarbonates form the larger family of halocarbonates. In turn halocarbonates are a part of mixed anion materials. Compounds where fluorine connects to carbon making acids are unstable, fluoroformic acid decomposes to carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride, and trifluoromethyl alcohol also breaks up at room temperature. Trifluoromethoxide compounds exist but react with water to yield carbonyl fluoride. ==Structures== {; align=right !MI !MII !MIII !Charge !CO3 !F - 3   rowspan=33 rowspan=31 rowspan=31 -   1 - 1 1  - 1  1 rowspan=24 rowspan=21 rowspan=22 -  2  - 2  1 rowspan=35 2 1 -  1 1 rowspan=21 rowspan=23 - 1 2  - 3  1 rowspan=36 2 2 -      -     - 4  1 rowspan=37 3 1 -    2 3 -  2 1 1 5 -  1 2 8 3 2 -  3 1 9 1 7 -  3 2 12 5 2 -  2 3 13 5 3 } The structure of the carbonate fluorides is mainly determined by the carbonate anion, as it is the biggest component. The overall structure depends on the ratio of carbonate to everything else, i.e. number (metals and fluorides)/number of carbonates. For ratios from 1.2 to 1.5 the carbonates are in a flat dense arrangement. From 1.5 to 2.3 the orientation is edge on. From 2.5 to 3.3 the arrangement is flat open. With a ratio from 4 to 11, the carbonate arrangement is flat-lacunar. The simplest formula is LnCO3F, where Ln has a 3+ charge. For monocations there is A3CO3F, where A is a large ion such as K, Rb or Tl. For M = alkali metal, and Ln = lanthanide: MLnCO3F2 1:1:1:2; M3Ln(CO3)2F2 3:1:2:2; M2Ln(CO3)2F 2:1:2:1; M4Ln(CO3)2F3¬∑H2O 4:1:2:3; M4Ln2(CO3)3F4 2:3:3:4. M2Ln(CO3)F2 2:1:1:3. For B = alkaline earth and Ln = lanthanide (a triple- charged ion) BLn(CO3)2F 1:1:2:1; BLn2(CO3)3F2 1:2:3:2 B2Ln3(CO3)5F3 2:3:5:3; B2Ln(CO3)2F3 2:1:2:3; B2Ln(CO3)F5 2:1:1:5 B2Ln(CO3)3F 2:1:3:1; B3Ln(CO3)F7 3:1:1:7; B3Ln2(CO3)5F2 3:2:5:2. For alkali with dication combinations: MB: MBCO3F MB3(CO3)2F3¬∑H2O. For dications A and B there is ABCO3F2 with a degenerate case of A = B. KPb2(CO3)2F is layered. Each layer is like a sandwich, with lead and carbonate in the outer sublayers, and potassium and fluoride in the inner layer. K2.70Pb5.15(CO3)5F3 extends this structure with some of the layers also being a double-decker sandwich of carbonate, fluoride, carbonate, fluoride, carbonate. In the rare-earth fluorocarbonates the environment for the rare-earth atoms is 9-coordinated. Six oxygen atoms from carbonate are at the apices of a trigonal prism, and fluoride ions cap the rectangular faces of the prism. ==Formation== Carbonate fluoride compounds can be formed by a variety of related methods involving heating the precursor ingredients with or without water. Thallous fluoride carbonate was made simply by evaporating a fluoride thallium solution in ethanol and water in air. It absorbed sufficient carbon dioxide to yield the product. Most other carbonate fluorides are very insoluble and need high-temperature water to crystallise from. Supercritical water heated between 350 and 750 ¬∞C under pressures around 200 bars can be used. A sealed platinum tube can withstand the heat and pressure. Crystallisation takes about a day. With subcritical water around 200 ¬∞C, crystallisation takes about 2 days. This can happen in a teflon-coated pressure autoclave. The starting ingredients can be rare-earth fluorides and alkali carbonates. The high pressure is needed to keep the water liquid and the carbon dioxide under control, otherwise it would escape. If the fluoride levels are low, hydroxide can substitute for the fluoride. Solid-state reactions require even higher temperatures. Bastn√§site along with lukechangite (and petersenite) can be precipitated from a mixed solution of CeCl3, NaF, and NaOH with carbon dioxide. Another way to make the simple rare-earth fluorocarbonates is to precipitate a rare-earth carbonate from a nitrate solution with ammonium bicarbonate and then add fluoride ions with hydrofluoric acid (HF). Pb2(CO3)F2 can be made by boiling a water solution of lead nitrate, sodium fluoride and potassium carbonate in a 2:2:1 molar ratio. ==Properties== { align=right !structure !colspan=4carbonate vibration, cm‚àí1 - ! !ŒΩ1 !ŒΩ2 !ŒΩ3 !ŒΩ4 - bastn√§site 1086 868 1443 728 - synchysite     - parisite 1079 1088 870 1449 734 746 - KCdCO3F  853 1432  - RbCdCO3F  843 1442  } The visible spectrum of fluorocarbonates is determined mainly by the cations contained. Different structures only have slight effect on the absorption spectrum of rare-earth elements. The visible spectrum of the rare-earth fluorocarbonates is almost entirely due to narrow absorption bands from neodymium. In the near infrared around 1000 nm there are some absorption lines due to samarium and around 1547 nm are some absorption features due to praseodymium. Deeper into the infrared, bastn√§site has carbonate absorption lines at 2243, 2312 and 2324 nm. Parisite only has a very weak carbonate absorption at 2324 nm, and synchysite absorbs at 2337 nm. The infrared spectrum due to vibration of carbon‚Äìoxygen bonds in carbonate is affected by how many kinds of position there are for the carbonate ions. ==Reactions== An important chemical reaction used to prepare rare-earth elements from their ores, is to roast concentrated rare-earth fluorocarbonates with sulfuric acid at about 200 ¬∞C. This is then leached with water. This process liberates carbon dioxide and hydrofluoric acid and yields rare-earth sulfates: : 2 LnCO3F + 3 H2SO4 ‚Üí Ln2(SO4)3 \\\\+ 2 HF + 2 H2O + 2 CO2. Subsequent processing precipitates a double sulfate with sodium sulfate at about 50 ¬∞C. The aim is to separate out the rare-earth elements from calcium, aluminium, iron and thorium. At high enough temperatures the carbonate fluorides lose carbon dioxide, e.g. : KCu(CO3)F ‚Üí CuO + KF + CO2 at 340 ¬∞C. The processing of bastn√§site is important, as it is the most commonly mined cerium mineral. When heated in air or oxygen at over 500 ¬∞C, bastn√§site oxidises and loses volatiles to form ceria (CeO2). Lukechangite also oxidises to ceria and sodium fluoride (NaF). Ce7O12 results when heated to over 1000 ¬∞C. : 2 Ce(CO3F) + O2 ‚Üí 2 CeO2 \\\\+ 2 CO2 \\\\+ F2 : Na3Ce2(CO3F)4F + O2 ‚Üí 2 CeO2 \\\\+ 3 CO2 \\\\+ NaF + Na2CO3 At 1300 ¬∞C Na2CO3 loses CO2, and between 1300 and 1600 ¬∞C NaF and Na2O boil off. When other rare-earth carbonate fluorides are heated, they lose carbon dioxide and form an oxyfluoride: : LaCO3F ‚Üí LaOF + CO2 In some rare-earth extraction processes, the roasted ore is then extracted with hydrochloric acid to dissolve rare earths apart from cerium. Cerium is dissolved if the pH is under 0, and thorium is dissolved if it is under 2. KCdCO3F when heated yields cadmium oxide (CdO) and potassium fluoride (KF). When lanthanum fluorocarbonate is heated in a hydrogen sulfide, or carbon disulfide vapour around 500 ¬∞C, lanthanum fluorosulfide forms: : LaCO3F + CO2 ‚Üí LaSF + 1.5 CO2 Note that this also works for other lanthanides apart from cerium. When lanthanum carbonate fluoride is heated at 1000 ¬∞C with alumina, lanthanum aluminate is produced: : LaCO3F + 2 Al2O3 ‚Üí LaAlO3 \\\\+ CO2 \\\\+ equiv AlOF Within the hot part of the Earth's crust, rare-earth fluorocarbonates should react with apatite to form monazite. == Minerals == Some rare-earth fluorocarbonate minerals exist. They make up most of the economic ores for light rare-earth elements (LREE). These probably result from hydrothermal liquids from granite that contained fluoride. Rare-earth fluorocarbonate minerals can form in bauxite on carbonate rocks, as rare-earth fluoride complexes react with carbonate. Carbonate fluoride compounds of rare-earth elements also occur in carbonatites. { !name !formula !pattern !formula weight !crystal system !space group !unit cell !volume !density !comment !references - albrechtschraufiteMgCa4(UO2)2(CO3)6F2‚ãÖ17‚Äì18H2O0:7:0:14:6:2 triclinicPa = 13.569, b = 13.419, c = 11.622 √Ö, Œ± = 115.82, Œ≤ = 107.61, Œ≥ = 92.84¬∞ Z=1774.62.69  - aravaite Ba2Ca18(SiO4)6(PO4)3(CO3)F3O   trigonal R'm a = 7.1255, c = 66.290 Z=3 2914.8    - arisite-(Ce) NaCe2(CO3)2[(CO3)1‚ÄìxF2x]F    P6ÃÖm2 a=5.1109 c=8.6713 Z=1 196.16 4.126 dissolves in dilute HCl  - barentsite Na7AlH2(CO3)4F4 9:0:1:12:4:4 505.95  P a=6.472 b=6.735 c=8.806 92.50 Œ≤=97.33 119.32     - Bastn√§site(Ce, La)CO3F0:0:1:2:1:1   P62m a=7.094 c=4.859     - Bastn√§site-(La)La(CO3)F0:0:1:2:1:1 217.91   P62c     - Bastn√§site-(Nd)Nd(CO3)F0:0:1:2:1:1 223.25        - BrenkiteCa2(CO3)F20:2:0:4:1:1 178.16 orthorhombicPbcn a=7.650 b=7.550 c=6.548     - CebaiteBa3(Nd,Ce)2(CO3)5F20:3:2:12:5:2 Monoclinic  a=21.42 b=5.087 c=13.30 Œ≤=94.8¬∞    - Cordylite = BaiyuneboiteNaBaCe2(CO3)4F1:1:2:9:4:1699.58  P63/mmc a=5.1011 c=23.096     - DoveriteCaY(CO3)2F0:1:1:5:2:1268.00        - Francolite          - Horvathite-Y (horv√°thite)NaY(CO3)F21:0:1:4:1:2 209.90  Pmcn  a=6.959 b=9.170 c=6.301     - Huanghoite-(Ce)BaCe(CO3)2F0:1:1:5:2:1 416.46 TrigonalR'ma=5.072 c=38.46    - Kettnerite CaBi(CO3)OF          - kukharenkoite-(Ce)Ba2Ce(CO3)3F0:2:1:7:3:1 613.80  P21/m a=13.365 b=5.097 c=6.638 Œ≤=106.45     - Lukechangite-(Ce)Na3Ce2(CO3)4F3:0:2:9:4:1 608.24  P63/mmc a=5.0612 c=22.820     - lusernaite Y4Al(CO3)2(OH,F)11.6H2O 0:0:5:15:2:11  Orthorhombic Pmna a=7.8412 b=11.0313 c=11.3870 Z=2 984.96    - Mineevite-(Y) Na25BaY2(CO3)11(HCO3)4(SO4)2F2Cl  2059.62        - Montroyalite Sr4Al8(CO3)3(OH,F)26.10-11H2O          - Parisite[LaF]2Ca(CO3)30:1:2:8:3:2 535.91 Rhombohedral R3 a=7.124 c=84.1     - Parisite-(Ce)[CeF]2Ca(CO3)30:1:2:8:3:2538.33 monoclinicCca = 12.305 √Ö, b = 7.1056 √Ö, c = 28.2478 √Ö; Œ≤ = 98.246¬∞; Z = 12    - Podlesnoite BaCa2(CO3)2F2 0:3:0:6:2:2 375.50 Orthorhombic Cmcm a = 12.511 b=5.857 c=9.446 Z=4 692.2 3.614 named after Aleksandr Semenovich Podlesnyi 1948  - qaqarssukite-(Ce)BaCe(CO3)2F0:1:1:5:2:1 416.46        - r√∂ntgenite-(Ce)Ca2Ce3(CO3)5F30:2:3:13:5:3 857.54  R3 a=7.131 c=69.40     - rouvilleiteNa3Ca2(CO3)3F3:2:0:7:3:1348.15  Cc a=8.012 b=15.79 c=7.019 Œ≤ =100.78     - Schr√∂ckingerite NaCa3(UO2)(CO3)3F(SO4)¬∑10H2O1:6:13:3:1+ 888.49      also with sulfate - Sheldrickite NaCa3(CO3)2F3¬∑(H2O)1:3:0:7:2:3338.25 Trigonal a = 6.726 √Ö; c = 15.05 √Ö Z = 3 2.86  - stenoniteSr2Al(CO3)F50:2:1:7:1:5 357.22  P21/n a=5.450 b=8.704 c=13.150 Œ≤=98.72     - SynchysiteCa(Ce,La)(CO3)2F0:1:1:5:2:1   C2/c a=12.329 b=7.110 c=18.741 Œ≤=102.68     - Thorbastn√§site CaTh(CO3)2F2.3H2O    P6ÃÖ2c a = 6.99, c = 9.71 z=3 410.87  brown  - zhonghuaceriteBa2Ce(CO3)3F0:2:1:7:3:1613.80 Monoclinic      } == Artificial == These are non-linear optical crystals in the AMCO3F family KSrCO3F KCaCO3F RbSrCO3F KCdCO3F CsPbCO3F RbPbCO3F RbMgCO3F KMgCO3F RbCdCO3F CsSrCO3F RbCaCO3F KZnCO3F CsCaCO3F RbZnCO3F { !formula !name !weight !crystal !space group !unit cell !volume !density !UV !thermal stability !properties !reference - !

See: Johnson proposed the position during the 2019 Conservative Party leadership campaign. The office is intended to emphasise Johnson's commitment to strengthening the bond between the countries of the United Kingdom. He is the first Prime Minister to adopt the title. In July 2019 the title was described as a \\"cynical rebranding\\" by Kirsty Blackman, deputy leader of the Scottish National Party in the House of Commons from 2017-2020, who advocates Scottish independence. On 4 September 2019, the Government announced ¬£10 million in funding to support the Prime Minister's work as Minister for the Union. The post has been retained by Johnson in his second ministry. During the COVID-19 pandemic in July 2020 Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales and leader of Welsh Labour, drew attention to Johnson's lack of contact with the Welsh Government, saying \\"If you are minister for the union, speaking to the component parts of the union seems to me a sensible way of discharging those responsibilities.\\" ==Responsibilities== In July 2020, one year after its creation, the gov.uk website continued to show no responsibilities associated with this position.

The two matches were scheduled to be played between an Asia XI and a World XI teams in March 2020. The matches would have celebrated the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh. The International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to the two fixtures. On 25 February 2020, the BCB named two tentative squads for the fixtures. However, on 11 March 2020, the matches were \\"deferred until further notice\\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Background== In November 2019, the BCB made a request to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to allow seven of its players to be part of the Asia XI team. Originally, India were scheduled to be playing their third One Day International (ODI) match against South Africa on the same day as the first fixture of this series. However, in January 2020, the BCB announced that the first T20I match would take place on 21 March 2020, therefore avoiding the clash with the ODI match. On 26 December 2019, the BCCI's Joint Secretary, Jayesh George stated that if Indian players are going to be a part of the Asia XI, no players from Pakistan would be allowed to play, due to the current India‚ÄìPakistan ongoing standoff. Five Indian cricketers out of seven, as requested by the BCB, would play for the Asia XI side, selected by BCCI President Sourav Ganguly. However, a BCB official denied the claim, saying that they do not have any such intention from an ethical ground. Subsequently, a day later, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ehsan Mani confirmed that no Pakistan cricketers would be available for the tournament, as the dates clash with the 2020 Pakistan Super League schedule. ==Squads== {  style=\\"text-align:center; margin:auto\\" - !colspan=2T20Is - !

He wrote the first major work on the coinage of the Empire of Trebizond. ==Career== After finding a Roman coin as a teenager, Bendall became a collector, researcher and dealer in ancient coins. After leaving Cheltenham College, he did military service (1956-58), partly in Germany, then studied part-time at the Institute of Archaeology, University of London (1962-1965), while working in the coin department of Spink & Son (1959-1965). He was later elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Bendall worked for several specialist coin dealers: the coin department of Spink & Son (1959-1965), A.H. Baldwin (1967-1987), Numismatic Fine Arts in Los Angeles (1987-1988), and in 1998 catalogued the first sale of the Byzantine gold coins from the Nelson Bunker Hunt Collection for Sotheby‚Äôs, New York. In the 2000s he rejoined Spinks in London (2006-2010). He was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Numismatic Society in 2010. His collection of Byzantine coins was stolen in London in February 2018.

The canal lies within the west of the Grachtengordel (canal belt) in the Jordaan neighborhood of the Amsterdam-Centrum district . ==History== The canal was dug after 1612 when the canal belt was created south of the Brouwersgracht. The remains of a lock can be recognized on the Prinsengracht side. That lock was necessary because the water of the Prinsengracht (along with the rest of the Jordaan Canals) remained at the polder level, while the water level in the Leliegracht, Keizersgracht and Herengracht was at the higher city level. Six of the eleven Jordanian canals were filled in in the 19th century. Only the Bloemgracht, Egelantiersgracht, Lauriergracht, Looiersgracht and Passeerdersgracht remained besides the canal belt Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht, Singel, Lijnbaansgracht, Brouwersgracht, Leliegracht and Leidsegracht. ==Architecture== *The 'Astoria' building on the corner of the Leliegracht and the Keizersgracht is an example of Art Nouveau architecture.

It displays permanent and temporary exhibitions of contemporary Tibetan art. ==Museum== The Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art in Emmen, Netherlands was created with the mission of spreading awareness and educating local and international visitors about contemporary Tibetan art and has been open since June of 2017. The museum has a collection of pieces that features work by Tibetan and Tibet- inspired artists, but consists mostly of works created and donated by the founder of the museum, Tashi Norbu. Today, the museum is host to several retreats, workshops, lectures, performances, and other events held throughout the year that focus heavily on preserving and teaching the public about Tibetan art and culture. The museum is run by the foundational board with help from over 40 volunteers . ==Museum founder, Tashi Norbu== Tashi Norbu was born in Bhutan. He studied about Thangka painting in Dharamshala, India, where he worked as a painter at H.H. Dalai Lama's residence. In 2000, he went to Belgium and, in 2007, he moved to the Netherlands. During subsequent studies he earned art degrees at Sint-Lucas (Ghent). He is also a sculptor. His sculptures made of waste materials called \\"Urban Buddha\\" are situated in Chicago, (4.5m high), Bihar India, (5√ó6m), and California Encinitas (3.9m high). They send messages across the globe about environmental awareness. He is the Founder of the Tibet House Holland. His art has been exhibited at the Queens Museum in New York, at the Bridgeport Art Center in Rotterdam and in all over the world galleries and Museums as well as in private collections. Tashi Norbu's Tibetan name was given by Namkhai Nyingpo Rinpoche who belonged to the legendary sacred ‚ÄúSky Dancers of Tibet‚Äù. Inspired his whole life by Rinpoche, Tashi Norbu painted the Sky Dancers, the Flying Monks, and Nuns and they are known as the famous ‚ÄúTime Travelers.‚Äù He was ordained as a Thangka Painter, by the previous reincarnation of Bokar Rinpoche. As the eldest son of the family, he had to accompany his two younger brothers into monastic life in Tibetan Monasteries of India‚Äù. Norbu's life from age 4 to 18 was spent in a Tibetan School in India and Bhutan, where he was ordained as a Buddhist practitioner, being intensively taught Buddha‚Äôs doctrines and philosophy, in addition to his general educational school studies. From 19 to 21 years of age, he studied in monastic settings, such as Sherabling, the residence of the 11th Tai Situ Rinpoche, founder of the 17th Karmapa, who was recognized by the HH Dalai Lama. Norbu had dialogues with Tai Situ Rinpoche regarding art, as Rinpoche was also a painter. Until the age of 25, Norbu followed Buddhist dialectics in Dharamsala. He also painted along with other Tibetan Thangka Painters in the Monastery Tai Situ Rinpoche that is dedicated to the art of painting Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In his two years at the monastery, he had a chance to experience and share monastic life with monks, teaching them English at the same time. Norbu's monastic life ended at the age of 25 when he came to the West, where he became a contemporary Tibetan Artist. Although he blends the traditional with the modern, his paintings still teach enlightenment and the path to Buddha-hood. They are filled with magical tales, colorful imagery, presenting valuable insight into the living quality of Tibetan Buddhism. Tashi Norbu was ordained as a Monk by H.E. Tulku Yeshi Rinpoche and he was given the name Karma Choeying Tashi. Also, his Bodhichitta vows were given by Tulku Yeshi Rinpoche. He dedicated himself to monkhood (Sangha) and Buddhism, yet he still engaged with his artistic activities--giving live painting performances, Mandala festivals, Tibetan Mantra Lounge recitations, and workshops on how to make a Buddha for the purpose of art and communication with the higher realms. He achieves trueness to ethnic-cultural Tibetan art while simultaneously speaking to the themes of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, where the practice of Buddhism is part of Tibet‚Äôs cultural heritage and asset. He talks about his depictions of the world and explains his artworks with reference to the Buddha‚Äôs teachings and theories. Norbu was also ordained by a Female nun of Tibetan Buddhism who is in a Dharamsala Monastery (who wants to remain anonymous); she advises and supports him. He specifically asked to be ordained by a nun, because he had been supported all his life by women, including his mother, sisters, and others. Furthermore, he supports the equality and rights of women in Tibet and the monastic world. ==Rensenpark== The museum is established in the former zoo of the Rensenpark, Emmen, Drenthe, Netherlands. Emmen Municipality which supports Museum, founded a creative industry hub in the Rensenpark, with a place not only for the Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art, but for various art galleries, and other artistic and non-artistic places. ==Gallery== Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 1.jpg Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 2.jpg Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 3.jpg Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 5.jpg Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 6.jpg Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 7.jpg Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 4.jpg Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art (Emmen, Netherlands) 8.jpg ==ReferencesExternal links== * Museum website Category:2017 establishments in the Netherlands Category:Museums established in 2017 Category:Asian art museums Category:Contemporary art galleries in the Netherlands Category:Ethnographic museums in the Netherlands Category:Museums in Drenthe Category:Buildings and structures in Emmen, Netherlands Category:Tibetology Category:Tibetan art ","title":"Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art"},{"id":"61352167","text":"Sergio Di Giulio (April 4, 1945 ‚Äì July 24, 2019) was an Italian actor and voice actor. ==Biography== Di Giulio studied at the Alessandro Fersen drama school.

With the goal of creating a stormwater detention basin for McDonald Creek, construction of the lake began in 1985. This project, costing Arlington Heights and surrounding suburbs $9 million, resulted in the lake. In 1990, the Arlington Heights Park District revealed plans to develop the land surrounding the lake into a park. On September 22, 1990, the land was ceremonially given to the park district by the village. According to the Chicago Tribune, the initial development plan was estimated to \\"cost about $1.75 million\\" and was to \\"include a lighted parking lot for 64 cars, boat docks and storage, a fishing dock, a bicycle path, and most likely a playground and a small building with a concession stand and washrooms.\\" The park officially opened on June 6, 1992, and all phases of the project were completed by 1995.History ‚Äì Arlington Heights Park District == Facilities == Today, the lake and its surrounding land is located in a 93-acre park known collectively as Lake Arlington.

It is between 300 and 800 metres thick and comprises fossiliferous limestones and marls that were deposited in a reef. Marine microfossils have shown an age between 165 and 150 million years. == Name and definition == The Antalo Supersequence includes two main stratigraphic units: the Antalo Sequence and the Agula Group. The Antalo Sequence, or Antalo Limestone has been named after the town of Hintalo in Tigray, Ethiopia. The name of the formation was coined by geologist William Thomas Blanford, who accompanied the British Expedition to Abyssinia in 1868. At that time, Hintalo was a major town on the route of the invading British army. So far the nomenclature has not been proposed for recognition to the International Commission on Stratigraphy. == Geographical extent == The sedimentary succession is found in Ethiopia, in the Mekelle Outlier, in the Blue Nile gorge, in the Harrar Plateau and around Dire Dawa. == Stratigraphic context == The Antalo Limestone overlies the Adigrat Sandstone, and is covered by the Agula Group or Agula Shale and the Mugher Mudstone. == Environment == The Antalo Limestone comprises sediment that was deposited in a shallow tropical sea in the upper Jurassic. As the region had undergone a marine transgression, it was below the sea level. At that time, what would become Ethiopia was positioned just south of the equator. == Lithology == Quarry in the third member of Antalo Limestone at May Qarano in Dogu‚Äôa Tembien The limestones and marls of the Antalo Sequence also hold shale and calcareous sandstone layers. The Antalo Limestone comprises four members: (1) a basal member with grainstone and wackestone lithologies, with marly interlayers and in the upper part stromatoporoid coral-like level; (2) sandy limestone deposited in estuaries and lagoons; (3) micritic (very fine grained) limestone with intercalations of wackestone and coquina beds deposited in relatively deep water; and (4) a succession of marls and limestone, with cherty limestone at the base. Rock sample of sandy limestone (second member), collected in Addi Idaga Rock sample from the fourth (upper) member, collected in Miheno == Fossil content == Rock sample of Antalo Limestone with mollusks, collected in Azef The Antalo Limestone sediments were deposited at the time of dinosaurs and primitive birds. Well away from coasts, coral reefs formed the edge of the continental shelf. At shallow depth, the sea bottom was made of large mudflats, with sand bars and spits near river mouths. This sea bed hosted many invertebrate animals: echinoderms, crustaceans, bivalves and gastropods were common. There was also fish. As it was not a nutrient-rich ecosystem, larger predators were rare, maybe some marine reptiles like crocodiles. A striking scavenger in this fauna was a cephalopod mollusc, a giant nautilus with a characteristic spiral shell. == Limestone and karst geomorphology == A spring in Antalo Limestone at Santarfa The layering is sub-horizontal, the same as that of the underlying sedimentary formations. This gives rise to a structural sub-horizontal relief, with alternating cliffs and flats. Dissolution processes in limestone lead to the occurrence of caves. Most described caves in Mesozoic limestone in Ethiopia are located in the Harrar region (Sof Omar cave) and in the Dogu‚Äôa Tembien district of Tigray. == Traditional uses of Antalo Limestone == Antalo Limestone is commonly used for house building; here a homestead in Addi Ateroman in Dogu‚Äôa Tembien Given its nearly rectangular shape and its strength, the hard layers of Antalo Limestone are used for :* House building. Traditionally, fermented mud will be used as mortar :* Fencing of homesteads, generally in dry masonry :* Milling stone: for this purpose plucked-bedrock pits, small rock-cut basins that naturally occur in rivers with kolks, are excavated from the river bed and further shaped. Milling is done at home using an elongated small boulder (mano) :* Door and window lintels :* Footpath paving :* Stone bunds or gedeba: terrace walls in dry masonry, typically laid out along the contour for sake of soil and water conservation :* Check dams in gullies for sake of gully erosion control :* Cobble stones, sold to the towns for paving secondary streets == References == Category:Geologic formations of Ethiopia Category:Geology of Eritrea Category:Jurassic System of Africa Category:Oxfordian Stage Category:Kimmeridgian Stage Category:Limestone formations Category:Marl formations Category:Shallow marine deposits Category:Paleontology in Eritrea Category:Paleontology in Ethiopia Formations ","title":"Antalo Limestone"},{"id":"61352231","text":"Leiosyrinx apheles is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Raphitomidae.MolluscaBase (2019).

When he was 6 years old, his family moved to Sha'arei Tikva. When he was 12 his mother died of cancer and two years later his family returned to live in Petah Tikva. When he was 13 years old he became interested in African-American music under the influence of his older sister, a singer as well. Plotnik began to write amateur rap in the wake of his childhood hero, Subliminal. He wrote extensively about his childhood and the beginning of his work in Petah Tikva, especially on his third album, \\"Welcome to Petah Tikva\\". His stage name was derived from the Amharic word \\"Nech\\" (·äê·å≠, meaning: white), most of Plotnik's childhood friends were Ethiopians and called him so affectionately. When Plotnik was 15 and a half years old he founded the \\"Produx\\" band with his friends Shmuel \\"Aritso\\" Yosef and Shimson \\"Chichu\\" Adama.

The Groenburgwal, Verversstraat and Zanddwarsstraat lead to the Raamgracht. Bridge 225 over the canal is beside the Kloveniersburgwal, and Theo Boschbrug (bridge 230) over the canal is beside the Zwanenburgwal. ==History == The area between the Kloveniersburgwal and the Zwanenburgwal was still \\"outside the fortress\\" (outside the city walls) until the late 16th century. It was added to the city in 1593. At that time there were weaving mills in the area, where after washing, carding, spinning, weaving and dying the woolen fabric was stretched on wooden frames (raamen) to dry and stretch. The names Raamgracht, Ververstraat and Staalstraat recall that period. On a map from 1625 by Balthasar Florisz. van Berckenrode the canal is called the \\"Verwers Graft\\" (Dyers Canal). It then makes a right angle near the Moddermeule Steech and merges into a wider area that is also called Verwers Graft (now called Zwanenburgwal). In the 17th century the cloth weavers moved to the then western border of the city, near the Bloemgracht and the Jordaan.Ontstaan van Amsterdam The Raamstraat, Raamplein and Raampoort can still be found there. The Raamgracht is located in the former Jodenbuurt (Jewish quarter) of Amsterdam. During World War II many Jewish residents of Raamgracht were taken to concentration camps and did not survive the war.De Raamgracht op het Joods Monument Afterwards, part of the buildings on the north side of the Raamgracht was demolished for the construction of the Oostlijn metro line. The Pentagon designed by Theo Bosch was then built here. ==Trivia == The weekly Vrij Nederland has been established for many years in a monumental building from 1914 on Raamgracht 4, on the corner with the Kloveniersburgwal. The Weekbladpers (publisher of Vrij Nederland and magazines like Opzij and Hollands Diep) is also located at Raamgracht 4.

He is best known for his victories in the 24 Hours of Spa in 2017 and Bathurst 12 Hour in 2020. ==Career1994-2015: Youth in karting, single-seaters and Porsche Carrera Cup === Jules Gounon is the son of the former racing driver Jean-Marc Gounon, who finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1997. He started karting in 2010 at the age of 15. He was crowned Rotax National French Champion in 2011. In the year after, he clinched the X30 world title. He was promoted to single-seaters, joining the French F4 Championship for the 2013 season and finished second with six wins. He competed one year in Formula Renault 2.0, but failed to impress as he \\"could not get on well with the team\\". As his career seemed to be in a deadlock after a difficult 2014 season, he was selected \\"Espoir Porsche Carrera Cup France 2015\\" to take part in Porsche Carrera Cup France for the next season with a grant of ‚Ç¨30,000. He scored his maiden win in the championship in Val de Vienne and finished sixth in the final standings. ===2016-2017: Success in German GT and win in the 24 Hours of Spa=== In 2016, he joined Callaway Competition in ADAC GT Masters, the German championship of GT. He drove a brand new Corvette C7 GT3-R with his teammate Daniel Keilwitz. Callaway ran three Corvette for this season. He won three times and put himself in title contention for the last event. However, Jules Gounon suffered a big crash at Hockenheim, staying conscious and alert, but with an injured (although not broken) left leg. Finally he stood third in the final standings while developing his new car during the year. Callaway Competition decided to run only the car of Gounon and Keilwitz for the 2017 season. He scored his first win of the season in Red Bull Ring. After this round, his teammate Keilwitz got injured and was replaced by Renger van der Zande who won with Gounon in Zandvoort, letting the Frenchman take alone the championship's lead. He then had two difficult weekends without podium with Albert Costa and van der Zende. However, he won his third race of the season in Hockenheim after the return of Keilwitz to competition. This last win let him seal the title in the last event. He also clinched the Junior title for drivers under 25. Also engaged with Jean-Luc Beaubelique and Nico Bastian in Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup (Pro-Am Cup), he took two podiums. He was recruited by Audi Sport Team Saint√©loc for the 2017 24 Hours of Spa, the greatest race of GT, teaming up with Christopher Haase and Markus Winkelhock. Despite running one lap down in the first half of the race because of a mis-threaded wheel, Gounon and his teammates came back in front. He battled with a Bentley in the last hours and created an 11-second gap with it to win the biggest victory in his career. This 2017 edition was very tight as six cars arrived in the same lap as the leader. ===Since 2018: Official factory driver for Bentley=== In 2018, Jules Gounon at the age of 22, was signed by Bentley M-Sport as an official factory driver for Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup and Intercontinental GT Challenge, replacing Oliver Jarvis. With Steven Kane and Guy Smith, the Frenchman had to develop the new Bentley Continental GT3 which replaced the former generation. In Paul Ricard, he scored his maiden podium with Bentley finishing second. He missed the win because of a bonnet problem. For the 2018 24 Hours of Spa, he had to leave the race after some braking problems. He also did a one-off in Super GT for the Fuji 500-mile race. He finished thirteenth which represented the best result of the team that season in the Japanese championship. Jules Gounon said about that 2018 season: \\"I have progressed and learnt a lot. [...] I had to get used with a new car. The target was to have a good car at the end of the season. Unfortunately, we had a lack of speed in straight lines. With this new Continental GT3, Bentley started again from the beginning. 2018 was a season of development. After more than two years of work with German people, I discovered another vision of motorsport with a different way of working. The Bentley Continental GT3 will have a say in 2019\\". For the centenary of Bentley in 2019, Jules Gounon was engaged in Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup and Intercontinental GT Challenge with Steven Kane and Jordan Pepper. After two complicated races, the Frenchman set the fastest time of the qualifying session in Paul Ricard, faster than his teammates and than his rivals. Battling with the Ferrari 488 GT3 of Miguel Molina, Jules Gounon and Bentley won their first race of the year and also their first win since the introduction of their new car back in 2018. Two weeks later, Jules Gounon participated in his first 24 Hours of Le Mans with Risi Competizione, teaming up with Oliver Jarvis and Pipo Derani on a Ferrari 488 GTE Evo. Qualified 17th in the category LMGTE Pro, they finished 11th in this category and 40th overall, despite a mechanical problem in the last hours of the race. ==Racing record== {  style=\\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\\" !

It was dedicated to Our Lady of Victory. The chapel was once adjacent to the plantation house of the Engenho do Paramirim. The chapel covers and is noted for its large, Byzantine-style domes covered in blue and white industrial tiles imported from Portugal. The chapel is in ruins and its images and baptismal font were first taken to Usina Cinco Rios, a sugarcane factory; the factory is now in ruins and the location of the chapel contents are unknown. ==History== The Paramirim Sugar Plantation was established in the mid-18th century by Frutuoso Vicente Viana, also the owner of the Madruga plantation in present-day S√£o Francisco do Conde. The construction of the chapel dates to at least 1757, when Vig√°rio Miguel Teixeira Pinto reported on the chapel as part of his report on the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora do Monte do Rec√¥ncavo (Freguesia de Nossa Senhora do Monte do Rec√¥ncavo). The chapel was built by the owner of the Paramirim Sugar Plantation, who owned other plantations and properties in the interior Rec√¥ncavo region of Bahia. The chapel was built in the 18th century in the Baroque style. The movement to replace Baroque architectural elements with the Neoclassical spread from Salvador to the interior of Bahia in the 19th century; this was reflected in the renovation of the plantation house, now lost, and the Neoclassical design of the chapel altar. Imperial palms (Roystonea oleracea) were introduced from France via Portugal in the early 19th century. The imported seeds were expensive, and presence of the palms among the rolling hills indicated the power and prestige of both plantations and some religious institutions, especially in the Rec√¥ncavo. Two of the palms from the period remain in front of the chapel. The Paramirim plantation was sold to the owner of the Usina Cinco Rios, a sugarcane processing factory in S√£o Sebasti√£o do Pass√©, in 1956. A baptismal font in lioz marble and images of the church were relocated to Usina Cinco Rios in this period. The factory is now in ruins and the location of the baptismal font and images is unknown. ==Location== The Chapel of Our Lady of Victory sits on a bluff in the Mataripe district of S√£o Francisco do Conde at the highest elevation in the district. The ruins of the plantation house are located adjacent to the west facade of the structure and the former workers quarters are located to the east. A French-style garden was constructed near the chapel and plantation house in the early 19th century; it is now lost. Imperial palms are located to the left and right of the facade. ==Structure== The Chapel of Our Lady of Victory is built of mixed masonry with two towers on either side of the facade. The towers are topped by distinctive, tiled Byzantine-style domes, a style unique among Bahian churches and chapels. The tiles on the domes were industrially produced in Portugal; they have a blue floral geometric design at center on a white background. Semi-oval openings are placed on all four sides of the belfries of both towers. The chapel lacks windows at the choir level, which are instead placed on the two towers. Cross- shaped openings are placed in the tower at the base of the domes. Each of the sacristies, located to the left and right of the nave, had two portals with arches spanning the length of the chapel. The Rococo-style facade was added when the chapel was renovated in the 19th century. It is composed of stucco and has complex design elements across the entire surface. An archivolt above the portal has three small relief plaques with an anchor, cross, and heart in each. A relief of an eight-pointed star is located between the portal and pediment with a shell design at its base. A large relief of a dove, as a symbol of the Holy Spirit, is prominently placed within the archivolt. The doors have three pilasters to either side; the first has a long diamond pattern with a rosette at center, the second has a relief of brickwork, and the third has the design of a simple column. ===Interior=== The interior of the chapel has a nave, chancel, two sacristies on either side of the nave, arched side galleries, and an ossuary. The nave and chancel are of equal width; the chancel is accessed via a large marble slab, now broken. Both the nave and chancel had marble floors. The nave flooring is in a black and white square and triangular pattern. The ceiling of the nave is flat, while that of the chancel is vaulted. The nave and chancel are separated by a chancel arch. The walls of the nave and chancel were lined with semi-industrial azulejos. The chapel once had a choir at the rear of the nave; a single wooden beam is the only remnant of the choir. A pulpit was located to the left of the nave that was accessed via a small staircase in the left-hand sacristy. Both the pulpit and it staircase are now missing, but its stone volute pediment, once painted blue, remains. A window with a wooden shutter with ornate lattice-work once connected the right sacristy to the chancel; it is now missing. The high altar was designed in the Neoclassical style and is composed of stucco. It was painted green and has a floral pattern in relief. The altar had a large niche at center that once housed an image of Our Lady of Victory. Oval-shaped oculi are placed to the left and right of the high altar; the left of the chancel had a door to the ossuary, and the right of the chancel opened to the right- side sacristy. The lavabo dated to the 18th-century and was composed of Lioz limestone and the baptismal font was of Carrara marble, all imported from Portugal. The lavabo and baptismal fonts are now lost. ==Condition== The chapel is now in an advanced state of ruin; the portals and windows are missing, the roof of the sacristy has collapsed, and all interior elements have been removed. The plantation house of the Paramirim Plantation is entirely in ruins. ==Protected status== The Chapel of Our Lady of Victory lacks municipal, state, or federal protection. It is recognized as a heritage site of Portuguese history by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Bahia Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:State heritage sites of Bahia Category:Portuguese Colonial architecture in Brazil ","title":"Chapel of Our Lady of Victory"},{"id":"61352534","text":"Holly Slept Over is a 2020 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Joshua Friedlander, in his directorial debut.

The galleries aim to preserve the historic heritage left by the influential House of Este, with a focus on relating their noble past to the local communities at each site. ==The concept== The museum is dedicated to making art history accessible to all. The museum's collection transcends regional and international boundaries. The collections are perhaps most famous for their variety, touching each realm of the Liberal Arts from antiquity to the 18th century. This includes a large collection of Baroque oil paintings of Christian subject; perhaps one of the most extensive collections of Renaissance bronze medals and coins in Europe, a rare group of decorative musical instruments as well as frescoes, panel and oil paintings executed by Italian artists who without being household names are of the highest quality. They museum want to be ‚Äúa single and purposeful voice of a shared cultural identity.‚Äù == Galleria Estense == Please follow to Estense Gallery for more details. Established in 1854 by Francesco V of Austria-Este and located since 1894 at its current address in the Palazzo dei Musei, the Estense Gallery includes four salons and sixteen exhibition rooms dedicated to the artistic heritage nurtured by the dukes and duchesses of Este throughout their years as leaders of Ferrara, but mostly focusing on the period following the move of the ducal seat capital from Ferrara to Modena in 1598. Gathered by aristocratic collectors with multiple interests, the Este collections include a rich collection of paintings dating from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries, including a group from the Po Valley school of painting, various sculptures in marble and terracotta; a large number of high quality decorative objects which formed part of the sumptuous furnishings in the various ducal residence, as well as important collections of drawings, bronzes, majolica, medals, ivories and musical instruments. Among the works by famous artists are a Piet√† by Cima da Conegliano, a Madonna with Child by Correggio, a Portrait of Francesco I d'Este by Vel√°zquez, a Triptych by El Greco, a marble bust of Francesco I d'Este by Bernini and a Crucifix by Guido Reni.Casciu, Stefano (2015). La Galleria Estense. Modena: Franco Cosimo Panini. == Museo Lapidario Estense == Please follow to Estense Lapidary Museum for more details. The Estense Lapidary Museum was the first public museum established in Modena. Founded by Francis IV of Austria-Este, restored duke of Modena, on March 31, 1828, its birth was inspired by examples such as the Maffeiano Lapidary Museum of Verona (1738), or the Lapidary Gallery in the Chiaramonti Museum in the Vatican (1800-1823), but with an emphasis on civilians: aiming to glorify the illustrious past of the city from its Roman origins. The initial nucleus consisted of some pieces already preserved in the Ducal Palace of Modena, acquired by the d'Estes from other antique collections or as excavation finds from the duchy territories of Brescello and Novellara. Right from the start, the citizens, together with the representatives of the clergy and the nobility, donated materials from their personal collections to make up the collection of the museum, which within a couple of years required a significant expansion, certified by the two commemorative epigraphs of its benefactors (from 1828 and 1830) still preserved today. Carlo Malmusi, directing curator, established the institution's guiding principles in 1830 as: \\"serv{ing} archeology\\", \\"for the memory of illustrious ancestors\\" with \\"finds from the Roman age.\\" The catalogue immediately prompted an influx of antiques and sepulchral tombs which, until the late seventeenth century, had been placed in the churchyard near the southern side of Modena's cathedral or in other sacred buildings of Modena and Reggio Emilia. The practice of raising funerary monuments had already been established in the pre-humanist era, following the example of nearby Bologna, in memory of those citizens who had distinguished themselves above all in the fields of law and medicine. == Biblioteca Estense Universitaria == Please follow to Biblioteca Estense for more details. Rich in ancient codices, musical scores, cartography, drawings, prints and exquisite illuminated manuscripts, The Estense library stands as a key player in the d‚ÄôEste inheritance. Established around the same time as the Galleria Estense, it has been considered by some Italian scholars as one of the most important art-historical libraries in Europe, not least due to the sheer variety of subject-matter documented by its folios. Works of exceptionally rare quality from the 4th century in Egypt to the 1930s, including the famed Bible of Borso d‚ÄôEste, and the earliest attempts by the Ferrarese to map Catalan in the New World. The library has been coveted by the House of Este: smuggled into exile both in 1598 with Cesare I and in 1859 with Francesco V providing a testament to the quality of its collection. Sheet music dating from the Renaissance, evangelical texts written in Greek Unical font, various French manuscripts from the 14th century, a family tree of the Byzantine theologian Joannes Zonaras, a Persian picture book of Romeo and Juliet by Nizami (Layla and Manjun) as well as several other psalters, encyclopaedias and maps of a regal, political and theological nature, each exclusive to the European dukes and duchesses of Emilia-Romagna, may be consulted, some of which require official permission. == Pinacoteca Nazionale (Ferrara) == Please follow to Pinacoteca Nazionale in Ferrara for more details. The Pinacotecta Nazionale is the national art gallery of Ferrara, also located in the Emilia-Romagna region on the piano nobile (or first floor) of Biagio Rossetti's Renaissance jewel, the Palazzo dei Diamanti. (commissioned by Leonello d‚ÄôEste in 1447). It was founded in 1836 by the Municipality of Ferrara after Napoleon‚Äôs widespread dissolution of churches threatened the protection of important public artworks. The gallery is formed as much around notable northern Italian painters as it is around the exquisite interior decoration of the palace itself, together with remnants of frescoes from local churches and later acquisitions from the Sacrati Strozzi collection. Not to be confused with the Civic Museum on the lower floor, hosting temporary exhibitions of contemporary art since 1992, the Pinacoteca houses an altogether more historic collection of paintings and sculptures by artists of the Ferrarese school dating from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century. The Pinacoteca, unlike the Galleria Estense, focuses more specifically on artistic production during the earlier half of the Estensi history, from their promotion as dukes of Ferrara in 1296 to their forced relocation to Modena in 1598. Such dukes include Leonello, Borso, Ercole I, Alfonso I and Alfonso II d‚ÄôEste. Arranged chronologically, the exhibition begins with a room dedicated to late Gothic sculpture, fresco and panel painting, progressing through to the early Renaissance, the sixteenth century, Mannerism and lastly to the early seventeenth-century before Cesare I lost Ferrara to papal rule. Highlights of the tour include the Hall of Honour, the sixteenth-century apartments of Virginia de' Medici, (in which the roundels painted by a young Carracci workshop are still visible in Modena's Galleria Estense) and a room dedicated to the step-by-step process of creating a fresco, panel or oil painting complementing Cennino Cennini‚Äôs Il Libro dell‚Äôarte. == Palazzo Ducale (Sassuolo) == Please follow to Ducal Palace of Sassuolo for more details. The Ducal Palace in Sassuolo, situated a short drive outside Modena, is widely considered as one of the most important baroque residences in northern Italy. A summer residence built by the architect Bartolomeo Avanzini on the request of Duke Francesco I d'Este in 1634, it was adapted from the older family d'Este castle into a modern suburban residence for the court. Wall paintings, stucco decorations, sculptures, fountains and vistas still convey a sense of baroque \\"delight\\" today, despite the palace having long remained in the shadows of public knowledge. After many years under military administration and a complex restoration project, the palace was definitively taken over by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism in 2004. It's stuccoed apartments currently host one of Gallerie's many on-going projects to marry the old with the new: minimalist pieces from the renowned Panza collection now hang in the frames previously filled by the duke's favourite contemporary paintings.Gallerie Estensi, \\"Palazzo Ducale di Sassuolo App,\\" Apple App Store, Vers.1.5 (May 2018) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Museums in Emilia-Romagna ","title":"Gallerie Estensi"},{"id":"61352594","text":"Bridget Markham (1579-1609), was a courtier to Anne of Denmark and subject of poems.

She was a cousin of the influential courtier Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. ==Marriage and the court== In 1598 she married Sir Anthony Markham (1577-1604) of Sedgebrook, Lincolnshire. He had been educated at Caius College, Cambridge and Gray's Inn.John Venn, J. A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students, vol. 1 (Cambridge, 2011), p. 141.

He died on 10 December 1604.Arthur Roland Maddison, Lincolnshire Wills: 1600-1617 (Lincoln, 1891), p. 9-10 \\"Anthonie Markham of Sydebrooke\\". After her husband's death, Bridget became a lady of the bedchamber to Anne of Denmark, Queen consort of King James VI and I. This appointment was due to the influence of her cousin the Countess of Bedford. She continued to manage her lands at Sedgebrook. Bridget, Lady Markham, died at Twickenham Park, a house belonging to the Countess of Bedford, on 4 May 1609. A relation, and fellow courtier and prot√©g√©e of the Countess of Bedford, Cecily Bulstrode was also ill at Twickenham, and she died on 6 August 1609. ==Legacies and Elegies== A Latin inscription at St Mary's Church, Twickenham records her close friendship with Lucy, Countess of Bedford, her appointment to the queen's privy chamber, her marriage and death on 4 May 1609.Richard Stutely Cobbett, Memorials of Twickenham (London, 1872), p. 86.

John Donne's poem alludes to Markham's mortal remains, her 'flesh' refined by her death like Chinese porcelain clay in an alembic to reveal the precious stones that comprise her soul: > But as the tide doth wash the slimy beach, > And leaves embroidered works upon the sand, > So is her flesh refined by death's cold hand. > As men of China, after an age's stay > Do take up porcelain, where they buried clay; > So at this grave, her limbeck, which refines > The diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls, and mines, > Of which this flesh was, her soul shall inspire > Flesh of such stuff, as God, when his last fire > Annuls this world, to recompense it, shall, > Make and name then, th'elixir of this all.John Carey, \\"John Donne: The Major > Works\\" (Oxford, 1990), p. 181 Bridget's eldest son Robert Markham of Sedgebrook (1597‚Äì1667) was a Royalist; a younger son Henry fought for Parliament.M.

Bridget's will was \\"published\\" on 3 May 1609, the day before she died. She hoped Frances would inherit and use her \\"childbed linen\\" at Sedgebrook, and her sons would go to Cambridge University. She left a legacy of ¬£20 to Catherine Widmerpoole, a servant of the Countess of Bedford. She gave her sister Anne Harington, Lady Foljambe, a locket with a picture of the Countess of Bedford, and her latest husband Sir John Molyneux of Teversal was made her administrator. To the Countess of Bedford she left her coach and mares, with the household silver she had pawned in London, a crimson velvet gown and a suite of tawny clothes embroidered with cloth of silver, and Bedford was to look after Frances with an allowance of ¬£50 yearly. She gave her fellow courtier Jane Meautys (1581-1659) her ruby and diamond buttons.

It is administered as part of the city of Salvador in the state of Bahia. The island is located in the center of the bay. It is in length, covers , and shaped like a fifteen-pointed star. Ilha dos Frades has preserved vegetation of the Atlantic Forest (Mata Atl√¢ntica), including native Brazil wood. The island is protected as part of the Environmental Protection Area of the Bay of All Saints. Ilha dos Frades served as an important part of the slave trade in Bahia. Enslaved Africans were transported from the port at Salvador to the interior Rec√¥ncavo region of Bahia. the island became part of the illegal slave trade in Brazil in the 19th century; enslaved people were brought directly to the island and led to the interior of Bahia. The practice only ended with the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888. ==Etymology== The name of the island, which translates to \\"Island of the Friars\\" refers to the murder of two friars murdered by the Tupinamb√° people early in the Portuguese colonial period. The friars traveled to the Ilha dos Frades in order to catechize and ultimately disappeared. ==History== By the early 18th century, the island belonged to Jo√£o Nogueira. Nogueira lived on the island with six or seven tenant farmers. The island had streams too small to support sugar cane cultivation; the tenant farmers only raised cows and pigs and grew subsistence crops. Francisco da Costa is recorded as an early owner of the island; he constructed the first Chapel of Loreto, or Church of Our Lady of Loreto (Igreja de Nossa Senhora de Loreto) in 1645. It was reconstructed in a new location in 1756. The Ilha dos Frades played an important part in the illegal slave trade in Bahia in the 19th century. Illegal landings were made at the Ilha da Itaparica and Ilha da Mare and enslaved people were led directly to the interior of Bahia, a practice that only ended with the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888. Franklin Am√©rico de Meneses D√≥ria, the Baron of Loreto, was born on the Ilha dos Frades in 1836. Loreto was a lawyer, politician, poet, and founding member of the Academia Brasileira de Letras. Gabriel Viana, a plantation owner, ruled the island in the manner of a feudal lord during the Rep√∫blica Velha, or First Brazilian Republic (1889-1930). Viana alternately decided on the punishment and execution of residents of the island and served as a benefactor of the local community. ==Communities== *Paramana, the main settlement of the island, population 900. It has a police station, a health clinic, beach huts, some restaurants, a small shop and a guest house. The Church of Our Lady of Loreto and a century-old house are located near the settlement. *Ponta de Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe, population 45. The settlement has beaches, handicraft stalls, an old mansion and a church that dates to the seventeenth century. *Costa de Fora, population 150.

While Dupeux admitted that the Conservative Revolution relied more on \\"feeling, images and myths\\" than on analysis and conceptualization and recognized the necessity to distinguish several leanings inside of it, he considered the movement to be an intellectual project with its own consistent logic, namely the striving for an Intellektueller Macht (\\"intellectual power\\") to promote new conservative and revolutionary ideas in wide society.Louis Dupeux, \\"Die Intellektuellen der konservativen Revolution und ihr Einflu√ü zur Zeit der Weimarer Republik\\", in Walter Schmitz et al., V√∂lkische Bewegung ‚Äì Konservative Revolution ‚Äì Nationalsozialismus. Aspekte einer politisierten Kultur, Dresden, Thelem, 2005, p. 3. He described the Conservative Revolution as a \\"German pre- fascism.\\" Dupeux saw five lines of divisions that can be drawn inside the Conservative Revolutionaries: the small farmers were different from the cultural pessimists and the \\"pseudo-moderns\\", who belonged for the most part to the middle class; while the proponent of an \\"organic\\" society were opposed to those of an \\"organised\\" society. A third division split the supporters of political and cultural transformations and those of a concrete social revolution, as far as challenging economic freedom and private property; while the fourth rift resided in the question of the Drang nach Osten (\\"drive to the East\\") and the attitude to adopt towards Bolshevik Russia, escorted by the debate on the place of Germany between the so-called \\"senile\\" West and \\"young and barbaric\\" Orient; the last division being a deep opposition between the V√∂lkischer and the pre-fascist thinkers. == Works == * Strat√©gie communiste et dynamique conservatrice.

He received his BSc in Pharmacology from the University of Glasgow in 1971 and then studied for a PhD in the laboratory of John Hughes and Hans Kosterlitz at the University of Aberdeen, working on the effects of opiates on release of neurotransmitters. Following the award of his PhD in 1974 he worked with Richard Alan North in Aberdeen and at Loyola University of Chicago studying opioid activation of potassium channels in brain neurons. He was appointed to a lectureship at the University of Cambridge and to a Fellowship of Sidney Sussex College in 1980. Along with Elizabeth Seward he demonstrated that opioid receptor activation inhibited the opening of voltage- gated calcium channels. In 1991 he was appointed to a Chair of Pharmacology and became Head of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Bristol. ==Research== Henderson's current research focuses on the mechanisms by which opioid drugs affect the central nervous system. In particular, his research group has studied the cellular mechanisms by which tolerance is developed to opioid drugs and how that tolerance may be reduced by other drugs such as ethanol and pregabalin enhancing the likelihood of opioid overdose. ==Academic leadership== He served as President of the British Pharmacological Society from 2006-2007 and as First Vice President of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) from 2010‚Äì2018.

Published by Marvel Comics. Cover art by Herb Trimpe and Dan Green From 1977 to 1979, Godzilla starred in a 24-issue run of comics written by Doug Moench, drawn by Herb Trimpe and published by Marvel Comics entitled Godzilla, King of the Monsters. The series thrusts Godzilla completely into the Marvel Universe. Godzilla first appears by bursting out of an iceberg near Alaska.Godzilla, King of the Monsters #1 Over the course of the series, he crosses the continental United States and eventually ends up in New York City.Godzilla, King of the Monsters #17‚Äì24 Godzilla's appearances in the first 15 Toho films are briefly alluded to, but never specifically mentioned due to copyright restrictions,Marvel's contract with Toho permitted them the comics rights to Godzilla, but did not permit them to use the other Toho monsters such as Minilla, Rodan, Mothra, Anguirus, King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla, etc. once in each of the first two issues.Godzilla, King of the Monsters #1‚Äì2 In at least one of the issues, Godzilla is seen as \\"the lesser of two evils\\". He has clashed with other monsters in the past and generally acts more like an actual animal, albeit one with unusual levels of intelligence.Godzilla, King of the Monsters #2 Despite such allusions to the films, Godzilla is depicted as more animal-like than as the highly intelligent, perhaps sapient, creature depicted in the majority of the films by the time of the series' printing (1977‚Äì79), in what is considered the Showa period of Godzilla films (1954‚Äì75). This version of Godzilla, while intelligent, is not the protector of mankind; however, he does, at times, exhibit compassion for human characters, such as Dum Dum Dugan, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who is tasked with his capture, destruction, or repulsion from America, and Robert \\"Little Rob\\" Takiguchi, the grandson of Japanese scientific expert Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi, who regards Godzilla as a hero and who is depicted as being Godzilla's only human friend. Unlike other characters whose actions, thoughts and feelings are told through thought balloons, Godzilla's are narrated externally via captions. Godzilla encounters not only the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. during the course of the series, but many other superheroes in the Marvel Comics universe. Among them are the now-defunct group the ChampionsGodzilla, King of the Monsters No. 3 (minus the Ghost Rider, although he was a member at the time), the Fantastic Four,Godzilla, King of the Monsters #20‚Äì24 Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy,Godzilla, King of the Monsters #21‚Äì22 and the Avengers,Godzilla, King of the Monsters #23‚Äì24 along with a brief cameo by Spider-Man in the last issue of the series.Godzilla, King of the Monsters #24 Godzilla also fights other gigantic monsters, including Batragon, Ghilaron, Lepirax and Centipor, monsters created by the insane geneticist Doctor Demonicus,Godzilla, King of the Monsters #4‚Äì5 Yetrigar, a giant Bigfoot,Godzilla, King of the Monsters #10‚Äì11 and the alien monsters the Beta-Beast and the Mega-Monsters-Triax, Rhiahn and Krollar (which are controlled by two warring alien races called the Betans and the Megans, respectively).Godzilla, King of the Monsters #12‚Äì14 Red Ronin, a giant samurai robot created specifically for the series,Godzilla, King of the Monsters #6‚Äì8 reappears in Avengers, Solo Avengers and an issue of Wolverine, in which Godzilla is given an oblique nod, being referred to as a \\"time-lost dinosaur\\", presumably to avoid legal action by Toho, as Marvel had, by then, lost the rights to depict Godzilla. Red Ronin also appears in the series Earth X. Godzilla, Yetrigar and Red Ronin participate in a three-way battle in the Grand Canyon. From Godzilla, King of the Monsters #11 (June 1978). Published by Marvel Comics. Art by Herb Trimpe and Ernie Chan Between February 1979 and July 1979, Marvel had the comic book rights to both Godzilla and the Shogun Warriors. While the characters never crossed paths in their respective comics, artist Herb Trimpe (who did the artwork for both of the series) drew a variation of Godzilla and Rodan alongside Daimos, Great Mazinger, Raydeen and Gaiking on the top page of a comic book ad soliciting the Shogun Warrior toys. Mattel Toys (who had the license to the Shogun Warriors at the time) also had the licence to produce toys based on Godzilla and Rodan at this time as well. Also around this time, Marvel had prepared another story featuring Godzilla, where he would have battled the Dragon Lord. But since the copyright had expired, they modified Godzilla into a dragon-like creature named the Wani for a story that was published in Marvel Spotlight (vol. 2) #5 (March 1980).DeFalco, Tom \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 197: \\"Tako Shamara became the Dragon Lord in Marvel Spotlight #5 by writer/editor Marv Wolfman and artist Steve Ditko.\\" Despite the loss of copyright, Marvel would continue to use Godzilla for several years afterward. In Iron Man #193, one of Godzilla's primary antagonists from the original series, Doctor Demonicus, captures, mentally controls and mutates Godzilla further so that he no longer resembles his Toho namesake. This altered version of the monster first appeared in Iron Man #193 and would return in #194 and 196. His last appearance to date was in The Thing #31, where he is actually referred to as Godzilla (although it is not known if the person saying this actually knows that he is Godzilla, or if this is just an example of the name possibly being used to refer to any big, green dinosaur that resembles a Tyrannosaurus rex). Godzilla also appeared in a shaded silhouette in a monster handbook viewed by Japanese children in Uncanny X-Men #181 (May 1981). Here the children refer to him as Gojira, his Japanese name. Apart from this, Godzilla has been referenced or parodied in other Marvel comics. In Web of Spider-Man Annual #2 (1986), the character Warlock from The New Mutants turned into Godzilla and then into King Kong during a rampage through New York City. In The New Mutants Annual #3 (1987), the Impossible Man turns into Godzilla during a battle with Warlock, who turns into Red Ronin. In The Amazing Spider-Man #413 (July 1996), Spider-Man battles a giant robot toy Godzilla (among other giant robot toys) created by the villain Mysterio. In The Mighty Avengers #1 (May 2007), a creature bearing a resemblance to the Heisei (1980s and 1990s) Godzilla appears, alongside other giant monsters sent to attack the surface world by the Mole Man. When this issue was solicited in Marvel Previews via a sneak peek page, the creature had Godzilla's distinctive dorsal spines. But when the actual comic was published, the dorsal spines had been removed. Godzilla is also mentioned in the 2005 one-shot comic Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters. In Astonishing X-Men (vol. 3) #36 (April 2011), the monster Fin Fang Foom is rampaging through downtown Tokyo. In one panel, he passes by a building that has a Godzilla billboard on its roof. The Marvel Comics Atlas (in the article on Japan) states that the Age of Monsters began in 1954, which is evidently a reference to the original Godzilla film. Additionally, the entry mentions that Godzilla returns years later in North America and is the reason for the construction of Red Ronin and the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Godzilla Squad. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s anti-Godzilla helicarrier, the Behemoth, has recently resurfaced under the command of Amadeus Cho in The Incredible Hercules #115 (April 2008). Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi, too, has reappeared in recent years, having been recruited by the Beast to join his X-Club in Uncanny X-Men #506 (April 2009). Another monster resembling Godzilla served as the \\"self-destruct event\\" for Takiguchi's lab on Kunashir Island in X-Men: First Class (vol. 2) #3 (October 2007). In 2006, Marvel reprinted the entire 24-issue run of Godzilla, King of the Monsters as a trade paperback called Essential Godzilla, King of the Monsters. Like all of Marvel's Essential line, the series was published in black and white, rather than color as in its original printing. ==Reception== This version of Godzilla was ranked No. 23 on Den of Geek's listing of Marvel Comics' 31 best monster characters in 2015. ==ReferencesSee also== * Godzilla (comics) Category:Marvel Comics titles ","title":"Godzilla, King of the Monsters (comic book)"},{"id":"61352851","text":"Sabih Abid Ali is a former Iraqi football defender who played for Iraq in the 1974 Asian Games.

Perrine, in 1893, made an acknowledgement of gifts to Stanford's Electrical Engineering Department in The Stanford Daily. Professor F.A.C. Perrine was the first faculty to teach the subject of electrical engineering at Stanford. In 1894, the first undergraduate degree in electrical engineering was awarded. Lucien Howard Gilmore of Capron, Illinois was the recipient. Prior to 1894, electrical engineering had been taught as part of the Physics and Mechanical Engineering curriculum. With the advancement of electricity, industry and employment opportunities were plentiful for those with knowledge in the subject. In 1899, Standard Electrical Company completed one of the world's longest transmission lines. Professor FAC Perrine was the engineer, and the following year, he left academia for industry. In 1919, Leonard F. Fuller earned the first PhD degree at Stanford's Electrical Engineering Department. Fuller was Stanford's first PhD in any engineering discipline. Fuller helped advance the west coast's electric power industry, as well as communications lines. After managing the Federal Telegraph Company's plant in Palo Alto, he became professor, and chair, of the electrical engineering department at University of California, Berkeley. The Stanford University Department of Electrical Engineering offers bachelor of science, master of science, and doctoral of philosophy degrees. Degree programs offer some flexible options, such as: * coterminal BS and MS degrees completed in 5 years. * Joint programs: EE MS/MBA and EE MS/JD * online graduate certificates * and non-degree options. ==Research areas== Electrical Engineering is a broad subject.

The league was earlier scheduled to start in February, but due to logistic reasons and commencement of other competitions, it was postponed to March, May then later July. Prior to the start of the league, a congress was held in Abuja on June 27, with representatives from Nigeria Football Federation. Due to failure of some teams to pay their indemnities, the agreed date at the congress was shifted from July 17 to July 24. At the end of the 2018 Nigeria Women Premier League, Pelican Stars and Sure Babes were relegated to the lower division while Dream Stars Ladies and Invincible Angels gained promotion to the League. Bayelsa Queens returns as defending champions, while Kaduna Queens bought the slot of Jokodolu Babes to compete in the elite division. At the end of the regular season, Confluence Queens, Bayelsa Queens, Rivers Angels and Adamawa Queens topped their group, thereby qualifying for the super 4 competition to determine the overall winner of the league, while Osun Babes, Dream Stars Ladies, Kaduna Queens and Invincible Angels proceed to relegation playoffs. ==Format== For the 2019 season, an abridged league format of four groups was adopted with four teams in each group. The top team in each of the four groups will play a super four mini-tournament at the end of the league to determine the overall winner of the league. The last placed team in each group will engage in a playoff to determine the two teams that will be relegated to the lower division. == Major transfers == The league saw the arrival of two Gambian internationals, Penda Bah and Isatou Jallow joining Rivers Angels and Dream Stars Ladies (with Jallow later joining Angels) respectively.

The Geldersekade is a canal and a street in Amsterdam that connects the Nieuwmarkt with the Prins Hendrikkade. The Geldersekade is in the easternmost part of De Wallen, the red light district, and borders Chinatown. ==Location== To the west, Elleboogsteeg, Stormsteeg and Waterpoortsteeg streets run between the even-numbered side of the Geldersekade and Zeedijk. To the east, Smidssteeg, Geldersesteeg, Waalsteeg, Binnen Bantammerstraat and Nieuwe Jonkerstraat run between the odd-numbered side and Rechtboomssloot. The monumental house Het Tabaksvat, at Geldersekade 8, was originally a 17th- century merchant's house. The facade is from the last quarter of the 18th century. The interior was used for storage by the ships supply firm J. & J. Vinke, later the Ship Chandlers Warehouse. ==History == The Geldersekade was part of the city moat dug at the end of the 15th century that, together with the Kloveniersburgwal and the Singel, formed the Stedegracht around the city. The Geldersekade ran north from Sint Antoniespoort (now the Waag) on the Nieuwmarkt to the Schreierstoren on the IJ. A city wall was built on the city side, the western bank of the Geldersekade. This is clearly visible on the 1544 bird's-eye view map of Amsterdam by Cornelis Anthonisz.. The eastern part, which was outside the city until 1585, was called the Cologne quay and then the Gelderland quay, and also the London quay or English quay for a short time. The names arose because there were jetties here where the ships from Gelderland, Cologne and England moored. The Geldersekade lost its function as a moat after the Nieuwe Gracht (the current Oude Schans) was dug and new city walls were built. The old city wall was demolished and houses were built. The Lastage was developed between the Geldersekade and the Oudeschans. A fish market was built after 1840 in the water of the Geldersekade, on the north side of the Nieuwmarkt. It replaced the fish market on Dam Square, which had to make way for the Beurs van Zocher. The scaffolding and wooden sheds were replaced in 1862 by the stone Gemeentelijke Vishal, which was demolished in 1938. The entire quay has been called Geldersekade since 3 April 1912. In addition, the nearby Leliestraatje was given the name Geldersesteeg.De naam van onze straat, J.A.Wiersma 1978 ==Bridges == * Gelderschebrug, bridge no. 297, is across the Recht Boomssloot / corner of Geldersekade. * Bantammer Bridge, bridge No. 298, connects the Binnen Bantammerstraat with the Stormsteeg. * Hoofdbrug, bridge no. 299, is located over the Geldersekade at the Prins Hendrikkade. * Kolkswaterkering, bridge no. 301, borders the Geldersekade at the Oudezijds Kolk / Prins Hendrikkade corner. There is also a diver bridge (495) in the Nieuwmarkt, the Bijleveldschesluis, over the water connection with the Kloveniersburgwal. ==Traffic == Until October 1980, the east side of the Geldersekade was an important through route, also for public transport. From 1905 to 1942, tram line 8 ran over the quay. After the war, tram line 26 (1946‚Äì48) and tram line 11 ran successively along the quay until 1955. After that it was a bus route with very intensive bus traffic from the early 1970s, especially for the bus line to the Bijlmer. After the opening of the metro to Amsterdam Centraal station in 1980, the east side of the Geldersekade was re-profiled. It was no longer suitable for bus traffic, which now had to pass through Valkenburgerstraat. Today it is an important cycle route.

In the 1940s, it was renamed to Jaragu√° because of a telegraph post that was next to the station with the same name. The located in the Km 95 of the SP-1452 road. In 1947, SPR lines were incorporated to the public state company Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundia√≠ (EFSJ). Besides many federal administrations, the station didn't went through any improvements, as in the 1970s and 1980s the lines were getting more abandoned.

In the following year, the station was reformed in the 1980s, the current building was constructed, and the train system was transferred to another federal company (CBTU).

The line originates in Saint Paul, Minnesota, crosses the St. Croix River on the Hudson Bridge into Hudson, Wisconsin, and eventually terminates in Altoona, Wisconsin. This subdivision is formerly a Chicago and North Western Railway (C&NW;) mainline, on which the Twin Cities 400 operated in the mid 1900s. ==History1868 to 1956=== In 1868, the West Wisconsin Railway began constructing a 188-mile route in the state of Wisconsin. Its purpose was to connect the Chicago and North Western line in Elroy west to Hudson. Construction was completed in 1872. This was the first segment built of what is now the Altoona Subdivision. Around the same time, the St. Paul, Stillwater and Taylors Falls Railroad built a line between Saint Paul and Taylors Falls, with a branch going to Hudson. In 1880, this line was conveyed to the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway (Omaha Road), who had acquired the bankrupt West Wisconsin Railway two years earlier in 1878, giving them control over all the present-day Altoona Subdivision tracks. This Elroy to Minneapolis-Saint Paul line was known to the Omaha Road as the Eastern Division. In 1882, Chicago and North Western invested about $10.5 million into purchasing the majority of the stock of the Omaha Road. Management of the company was reorganized and put under the C&NW.; By 1913, the line was double- tracked. In 1935, the C&NW; had the inaugural run of the Twin Cities 400, with this section of track on its route (see Passenger operations). ===1957 to 1994=== On January 1, 1957, the C&NW; began leasing the Omaha Road in order to gain total control. Through merging and other reorganizations, the Omaha Road had effectively come to an end. In 1972, the company officially terminated and fully became part of the Chicago and North Western Railway. The line that would become the Altoona Subdivision was now completely owned and operated by the C&NW.; Now that the C&NW; had complete control, they referred to the majority of the line as the Eau Claire Subdivision. The former St. Paul, Stillwater and Taylors Falls Railroad section to Taylors Falls, which had been shortened to Stillwater, became known as the Stillwater Subdivision. This short stretch of track served industries in Bayport, Minnesota. In 1963, the Twin Cities 400 was discontinued and the line was single-tracked soon after. ===1995 to present=== alt= In 1995, Union Pacific announced its plans to acquire 100 percent of the C&NW; through buying stock. April 24, 1995, was the last day of independent operation. The following day, all of Chicago and North Western's assets, including the Eau Claire and Stillwater Subdivisions, had officially become part of the Union Pacific. The Eau Claire Subdivision's mileage was modified slightly and was renamed to the Altoona Subdivision. The Stillwater Subdivision was merged into the Altoona Subdivision and is now known as the Stillwater Industrial Lead, still serving Bayport. Until 1999, there was a spur off of the Altoona Subdivision in Hudson, Wisconsin, that led up to Spooner. This was bought by the C&NW; until they tore up the tracks in 2000. They would serve bags, machines, metal, and copper to the Accu-Tech Tool & Design, Inc. in Hudson, and coal up to Spooner to operate plants. From 2003 to 2015, the Norfolk Southern Railway ran their Triple Crown roadrailer trains (Symbol Z-EMCH, Twin Cities to Chicago) on the Altoona Subdivision using trackage rights. These trains usually carried Ford automotive parts to Chicago. Norfolk Southern ended 60 percent of their Triple Crown routes on December 11, 2015, including service to the Twin Cities and many others. The Minnesota Commercial Railway, using trackage rights on the Altoona Subdivision, served Andersen Corporation with a weekly delivery of lumber and sand. The train was known as the \\"Bayport Job\\". However in 2017, Minnesota Commercial ceased operations of this train due to cost concerns. As of 2015, the Altoona Subdivision is one of Union Pacific's less dense lines, usually seeing up to three to five trains per day on the Minnesota side. The Wisconsin side sees a few more trains due to short locals delivering to industries. This subdivision does not have any single or double stack intermodal traffic. In 2019, the 150th anniversary of the First Transcontinental Railroad, a Union Pacific excursion train ran on the Altoona Subdivision as part of the \\"Great Race Across the Midwest\\" celebratory tour. The train was led by UP 4014, a 4-8-8-4 Big Boy-type steam locomotive. The Big Boy traveled the entire Altoona Subdivision in one day, attracting many visitors in local communities. ==Passenger operationsTwin Cities 400=== alt= The Altoona Subdivision was part of the Twin Cities 400's route from 1935 to 1963 when it was discontinued. The \\"400\\" operated between Chicago and Saint Paul, with a final stop in Minneapolis. The Twin Cities 400 experienced great success, resulting in the creation of an entire fleet of trains carrying the \\"400\\" name. These trains earned Chicago and North Western the nickname \\"Route of the 400\\". ==Hudson Bridge== When the line reaches the St. Croix River, it crosses into Wisconsin via the Hudson Bridge. The bridge starts south of Bayport, Minnesota, and lands in Hudson, Wisconsin. Its current incarnation was constructed in 1912 by the American Bridge Company of New York. Originally, it was a wooden swing span with a 1,000 ft trestle on the east side. In 1881, many sections were rebuilt into lattice style. The bridge is a swing bridge and is left in the open position unless in use by a train. To use the bridge, train crews call the operator via radio. ==References== * Category:Union Pacific Railroad lines Category:Rail infrastructure in Minnesota Category:Rail infrastructure in Wisconsin ","title":"Altoona Subdivision"},{"id":"61354175","text":"Vila Aurora is a train station on CPTM Line 7-Ruby, in the district of in S√£o Paulo. ==History== Because of the distance between Jaragu√° and Perus stations, the Prefecture of S√£o Paulo suggested to the State Government the construction of Vila Aurora station between them in the Director Plan of the Subprefecture of Pirituba.

In February and August 2020, United States Intelligence Community experts warned members of Congress that Russia is interfering in the 2020 presidential election in President Donald Trump's favor. ==Reports of attempted interference Overview === In response to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, special counsel Robert Mueller conducted a two- year-long investigation. The resulting report concluded that Russia interfered in \\"sweeping and systematic fashion\\".Mueller Report , vol. I, p. 1: \\"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\\" In his July 2019 Congressional testimony, Mueller stated that the Russians continue to interfere in U.S. elections \\"as we sit here\\", and that \\"many more countries\\" have developed disinformation campaigns targeting U.S. elections, based partly on the Russian model. Also in July 2019, the Senate Intelligence Committee released the first volume of a bipartisan report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, a report that included recommendations for securing the 2020 elections. The second volume of that report noted, based on social-media data from October 2018, that \\"Russian disinformation efforts may be focused on gathering information and data points in support of an active measures campaign targeted at the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\\" The Central Intelligence Agency stated in a highly classified report, \\"We assess that President Vladimir Putin and the senior most Russian officials are aware of and probably directing Russia's influence operations aimed at denigrating the former U.S. Vice President, supporting the U.S. president and fueling public discord ahead of the U.S. election in November.\\" The existence of this report, published at the end of August 2020, was made public knowledge on September 22 in reports from The Washington Post and The New York Times. U.S. officials have accused Russia, China and Iran of trying to influence the 2020 elections. Between January and late July 2017, Twitter identified and shut down over 7,000 phony accounts created by Iranian influence operations. According to Christopher A. Wray, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Russia is attempting to interfere with the 2020 United States elections. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in July 2019, Wray stated, \\"We are very much viewing 2018 as just kind of a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.\\" Dan Coats, the former Director of National Intelligence, believes that Russia and China will both attempt to influence the elections. As of September 2020, intelligence officials point to Russia as the more \\"acute threat\\" to the election, saying that China has been expressing its preferences by public rhetoric rather than engaging in covert operations to denigrate a candidate or otherwise interfere in the election itself. Wray testified to the House Committee on Homeland Security on September 17, 2020 that Russian efforts to damage the Biden campaign were \\"very active\\". === Social-media disinformation and voting infrastructure === Various disinformation campaigns on social media have targeted the Democratic Party candidates running in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. This has prompted considerable concern regarding the ability of social media companies to cope with disinformation and manipulation. By August 2019, Facebook and Twitter had banned advertisements that use misinformation to attempt the suppression of voter turnout. Microsoft developed an open source software called ElectionGuard to help safeguard the 2020 elections. In mid-July 2019, Microsoft announced that it had, over the prior year, \\"notified nearly 10,000 customers they've been targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks\\". Based on attacks that had targeted political organizations, and on experience from 2016 and 2018, Microsoft anticipated \\"attacks targeting U.S. election systems, political campaigns or NGOs that work closely with campaigns\\". Of the \\"nation-state attacks\\" that had originated from Russia, Microsoft claimed that they followed the \\"same pattern of engagement\\" as Russian operations in 2016 and 2018. On September 20, 2019, Microsoft announced that it would provide free security updates for Windows 7, which reached its end-of-life on January 14, 2020, on federally-certified voting machines through the 2020 United States elections. On October 4, 2019, Microsoft announced that \\"Phosphorus\\", a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government, had attempted to compromise e-mail accounts belonging to journalists, prominent Iranian expatriates, U.S. government officials and the campaign of a U.S. presidential candidate. While Microsoft did not disclose which campaign had been the target of the cyber attack, unnamed sources informed Reuters that it had been that of Donald Trump. On October 21, 2019, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company has detected a \\"highly sophisticated\\" set of campaigns to interfere with the 2020 elections. These campaigns originated from Russia and from Iran. Fake accounts based in Russia posed as Americans of varied political backgrounds and worked to undermine the campaign of Joe Biden, aiming to sow discontent with Biden from both the left and the right. A September 2019 report from The Washington Post demonstrated that due to bad default passwords and weak encryption, hackers with physical access can easily get into voting machines designed for use in the 2020 United States elections, and remote hacking was possible if the machines were accidentally misconfigured. On February 21, 2020, The Washington Post reported that, according to unnamed US officials, Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders issued a statement after the news report, saying in part, \\"I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.\\" Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia's alleged efforts about a month prior. Sanders suggested that Russians were impersonating people claiming to be his supporters online in order to create an atmosphere of toxicity and give \\"Bernie Bros\\" a bad reputation, a suggestion that Twitter rejected. According to election-security expert Laura Rosenberger, \\"Russian attempts to sow discord in the Democratic primary would be consistent with its strategy of undermining Americans' faith in democratic institutions and processes.\\" In March 2020, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the Brennan Center for Justice published a report indicating that Russia-linked social media accounts have been spreading Instagram posts calculated to sow division among American voters. According to the report, Russian operatives were increasingly impersonating real political candidates and groups rather than creating fictional groups. According to Twitter's head of site integrity, Russian agents also attempted in 2018 to create the impression of more election interference than is actually happening to undermine confidence in the process. Shortly thereafter, the New York Times reported that according to American intelligence officials Russian operatives have been stoking via private Facebook groups anger among African Americans, emphasizing allegations of police brutality in the United States, highlighting racism in the United States against African Americans, and promoting and pressuring hate groups, including white and black extremist groups, in order to create strife within American society, though American intelligence officials provided few details about the alleged operations. A CNN investigation found that Russian efforts had partly been outsourced to troll farms in Ghana and Nigeria. In May 2020, Twitter suspended 44 accounts that exhibited behavior plausibly, but not definitively, indicative of Russian election interference tactics, including association with a Ghana troll farm. === Briefings to Congress === On February 13, 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected. The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community's top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. Trump allies on the committee challenged the findings, and Trump was angered to learn of the briefing as he believed Democrats might \\"weaponize\\" the information against him. He chastised Maguire for allowing the briefing to occur, and days later he appointed Richard Grenell to replace Maguire. William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center told members of Congress during a classified briefing on July 31, 2020, that Russia was working to boost the campaign of Trump and undermine that of Biden. Details of Evanina's report were not made public. The Biden campaign confirmed to the Associated Press that they had \\"faced multiple related threats\\" but were \\"reluctant to reveal specifics for fear of giving adversaries useful intelligence\\". Evanina later stated in a press release, \\"We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment.'\\" On August 7, 2020, CNN reported that intelligence officials had provided senators, representatives and both the Biden and Trump campaigns with information \\"indicating Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation push targeting\\" Biden. That same day, Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, asserted that Republican senators investigating Biden and his son were \\"acting as Russian launderers of this information.\\" === Johnson, Derkach, and Giuliani === In late 2019, the chairman of the Senate committee investigating the matter, Ron Johnson, was warned by American intelligence officials of a risk he could be playing into the hands of Russian intelligence to spread disinformation. During this period, Richard Burr (R-NC), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also warned Johnson that Johnson's investigation could aid Russian efforts to promote distrust in the United States' political system. Senators had also been briefed in late 2019 about Russian efforts to frame Ukraine for 2016 election interference. Johnson initially said he would release findings in spring 2020, as Democrats would be selecting their 2020 presidential nominee, but instead ramped up the investigation at Trump's urging in May 2020, after it became clear Biden would be the nominee. In March 2020, Johnson decided to postpone the issuing of a subpoena for former Ukrainian official and employee of a Democratic lobby firm Blue Star Strategies Andrii Telizhenko, a close ally of Rudy Giuliani who had made appearances on the pro-Trump cable channel One America News, after Senator Mitt Romney backed away on voting for Mr. Telizhenko, as the Senators from the Democratic Party pressured Senator Romney on Mr. Telizhenko's vote. Trump tweeted a press report about the investigations, later stating that he would make allegations of corruption by the Bidens a central theme of his re- election campaign. In May 2020, Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, a Giuliani associate whom Evanina had named as a key participant in Russian interference, released snippets of alleged recordings of Joe Biden speaking with Petro Poroshenko, the Ukrainian president during the years Biden's son, Hunter, worked for Burisma Holdings. The Bidens had been accused without evidence of malfeasance relating to Burisma. The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared heavily edited, depicted Biden linking loan guarantees for Ukraine to the ouster of the country's prosecutor general. The recordings did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son. Poroshenko denied In June 2020 that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma. In September 2020, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach, stating he \\"has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services.\\" The Treasury Department added Derkach \\"waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election,\\" including by the release of \\"edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials.\\" Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, had spent significant time working in Ukraine during 2019 to gather information about the Bidens, making frequent American television appearances to discuss it. Attorney general Bill Barr confirmed in February 2020 that the Justice Department had created an \\"intake process\\" to analyze Giulian's information. This information included a September 2019 statement by former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin falsely claiming he had been fired at Biden's insistence because Shokin was investigating Biden's son. The statement disclosed that it had been prepared at the request of attorneys for Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash, which since July 2019 included Joseph diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing ‚Äî both close associates of Trump and Giuliani. Firtash, fighting extradition to the United States where he was under federal indictment, is believed by the Justice Department to be connected to high levels of Russian organized crime, which allegedly installed him as a broker for Ukrainian imports of Russian natural gas. He is also reportedly close to the Kremlin to support Russian interests in Ukraine. According to officials interviewed by The Daily Beast, then- National Security Advisor John Bolton told his staff not to meet with Giuliani, because Bolton had been informed that Giuliani was spreading conspiracy theories that aligned with Russian interests in disrupting the 2020 election. These officials were also concerned that Giuliani would be used as a conduit for disinformation, including \\"leaks\\" of emails that would mix genuine with forged material in order to implicate Hunter Biden in corrupt dealings. The New York Times reported in November 2019 that Giuliani had directed associate Lev Parnas to approach Firtash about hiring the couple, with the proposition that Firtash could help to provide compromising information on Biden, which Parnas's attorney described was \\"part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter.\\" Giuliani denied any association with Firtash, though he told CNN he met with a Firtash attorney for two hours in New York City at the time he was seeking information about the Bidens. As vice president, Biden had urged the Ukrainian government to eliminate brokers such as Firtash to reduce the country's reliance on Russian gas. After his October 2019 indictment, Parnas asserted that he, Giuliani, diGenova and Toensing had a deal with Firtash in which the oligarch would provide information to discredit Biden in exchange for Giuliani persuading the Justice Department to drop its efforts to extradite Firtash. The Washington Post reported in October 2019 that after they began representing Firtash, Toensing and diGenova secured a rare face-to-face meeting with Barr to argue the Firtash charges should be dropped. Prior to that mid-August meeting, Barr had been briefed in detail on the initial Trump‚ÄìUkraine whistleblower complaint within the CIA that had been forwarded to the Justice Department, as well as on Giuliani's activities in Ukraine. Bloomberg News reported that its sources told them Giuliani's high- profile publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political quid pro quo. Barr declined to intervene in the Firtash case. Firtash denied involvement in collecting or financing damaging information on the Bidens. === Developments in summer and fall 2020 === By summer of 2020, Russian intelligence had advanced to \\"information laundering\\" in which divisive propaganda was reported on Russia-affiliated news websites with the expectation the stories would be picked-up and spread by more legitimate news outlets. In September 2020, Facebook and Twitter announced that they had been alerted to the existence of Peace Data, a website set up by Russia's Internet Research Agency to interfere with the 2020 election. The social-media companies deleted accounts that had been used in an operation to recruit American journalists to write articles critical of Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris. On September 3, the intelligence branch of the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to state and federal law enforcement that Russia was \\"amplifying\\" concerns about postal voting and other measures taken to protect voters during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to DHS analysts, \\"Russian malign influence actors\\" had been spreading misinformation since at least March. Trump had repeatedly asserted without evidence that voting by mail would result in widespread fraud. ABC News reported in September 2020 that the Homeland Security Department had withheld the July release of an intelligence bulletin to law enforcement that warned of Russian efforts to promote ‚Äúallegations about the poor mental health‚Äù of Joe Biden. DHS chief of staff John Gountanis halted the release pending review by secretary Chad Wolf. The bulletin stated that analysts had ‚Äúhigh confidence‚Äù of the Russian efforts, which were similar to efforts by Trump and his campaign to depict Biden as mentally unfit. A DHS spokesperson said the bulletin was ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù because it did not meet the department's standards. The bulletin had not been released as of the date of the ABC News report. Later in September, Brian Murphy ‚Äî a former DHS undersecretary for intelligence and analysis ‚Äî asserted in a whistleblower complainthttps://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/murphy_wb_dhs_oig_complaint9.8.20.pdf that Wolf told him ‚Äúthe intelligence notification should be ‚Äòheld‚Äô because it ‚Äòmade the President look bad.‚Äô‚Äù Murphy also claimed Wolf told him to \\"cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the US, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran.‚Äù Murphy said Wolf told him this directive came from White House national security advisor Robert O'Brien. On September 10, 2020, Reuters reported that hackers had tried and failed to breach the systems of SKDKnickerbocker, a political consulting firm that specializes in working for Democratic Party politicians and that had been working with the Biden campaign for two months. Microsoft, who detected the cyberattack, informed SKDKnickerbocker that Russian state-backed hackers were the likely perpetrators. Analysts and officials interviewed by The New York Times in September 2020 indicated that a primary tactic of Russian disinformation campaigns was to amplify misleading statements from Trump, chiefly about postal voting. Russia's Internet Research Agency also created a fictitious press organization, the \\"Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens\\", in order to feed propaganda to right- wing social media users. NAEBC accounts were blocked or suspended by Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, but their content \\"got more traction\\" on Gab and Parler, according to a Reuters report. H.R. McMaster, Trump's former national security advisor, said on October 1 that Trump was \\"aiding and abetting Putin‚Äôs efforts by not being direct about this. This sustained campaign of disruption, disinformation and denial is aided by any leader who doesn‚Äôt acknowledge it.\\" On October 5, The Washington Post reported that the State Department had revoked the travel visa of Giuliani associate Andrii Telizhenko. New York Post story In October 2020, the FBI reportedly launched an investigation into whether a story published in the tabloid journal New York Post on October 14 might be part of a Russian disinformation effort targeting Biden. The story, titled \\"Biden Secret Emails\\", displayed an email supposedly showing that Hunter Biden had arranged for his father, then- vice-president Joe Biden, to meet with a top advisor to Burisma. The Biden campaign said that no such meeting ever happened. The Post's source for the data was Giuliani, who says he got it from the hard drive of a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019 and never picked up. The shop owner told reporters that he thought the person who dropped it off was Hunter Biden but wasn't sure. He said he eventually gave the laptop to the FBI, keeping a copy of the hard drive for himself that he later gave to Giuliani. A year and a half earlier, in early 2019, White House officials had been warned that the Russians were planning to leak forged emails in the weeks before the election, and that Giuliani could be the conduit for such a leak. Most of the New York Post story was written by a staff reporter who did not allow his name to be used on it because he doubted the story's credibility. According to an investigation by The New York Times, editors at the New York Post \\"pressed staff members to add their bylines to the story\\", and at least one refused, in addition to the original author. Of the two writers eventually credited on the article, the second did not know her name was attached to it until after it was published. Giuliani was later quoted as saying he had given the hard drive to the New York Post because \\"either nobody else would take it, or if they took it, they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out.\\" A few days after the story was published, more than 50 former senior intelligence officials signed a letter saying that while they had no evidence, the story \\"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\\" ==Government reaction== Dan Coats appointed Shelby Pierson as the U.S. election security czar in July 2019, creating a new position in a move seen as an acknowledgment that foreign influence operations against U.S. elections will be ongoing indefinitely. Election-security task forces established before the 2018 midterm elections at the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command have been expanded and \\"made permanent\\". The Department of Homeland Security indicated that the threat of ransomware attacks upon voter registration databases was a particular concern. Prior to resigning as U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen attempted to organize a meeting of the U.S. Cabinet to discuss how to address potential foreign interference in the 2020 elections. Mick Mulvaney, the White House Chief of Staff, reportedly warned her to keep the subject away from Trump, who views the discussion as questioning the legitimacy of his victory in 2016. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has blocked various bills intended to improve election security from being considered, including some measures that have had bipartisan support. Election-security legislation remains stalled in the Senate as of February 2020. However, various states have implemented changes, such as paper ballots. Florida has expanded its paper-ballot backup system since 2016, but experts warn that its voting systems are still vulnerable to manipulation, a particular concern being the electronic poll books that store lists of registered voters. All 67 election supervisors in Florida have been required to sign nondisclosure agreements, and consequently, information such as the identity of which four counties had been hacked by Russian intelligence in 2016 remains unknown to the public. Democratic members of Congress cited the lack of effort to secure U.S. elections against foreign interference, particularly from Russia, as among grounds to begin an impeachment inquiry. On September 30, 2019, the United States issued economic sanctions against seven Russians affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, an organization that manipulates social media for misinformation purposes. The sanctions were described as a warning against foreign interference in United States elections. On December 9, 2019, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray told ABC News: \\"as far as the [2020] election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat.\\" According to William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, Russia is \\"using social media and many other tools to inflame social divisions, promote conspiracy theories and sow distrust in our democracy and elections.\\" Bloomberg News reported in January 2020 that American intelligence and law enforcement were examining whether Russia was involved in promoting disinformation to undermine Joe Biden as part of a campaign to disrupt the 2020 election. The following month, the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service warned that Russia would attempt to interfere in the Georgian parliamentary election in October 2020 as well as the US election in November. On July 13, 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to FBI Director Wray, requesting a briefing on a \\"concerted foreign interference campaign\\" targeting the United States Congress. The request for an all-Congress briefing, also signed by Rep. Adam Schiff and Sen. Mark Warner, was made public one week later, save for a classified addendum that was not released to the media. === Trump administration reaction === The Trump administration reacted to the briefing by American intelligence officials to the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected by rejecting the efforts were in favor of Trump and by firing Joseph Maguire, who was involved in those reports. By contrast, Trump and his national security adviser Robert O'Brien accepted reports the Russians were supporting the nomination of Bernie Sanders. Three weeks after Trump loyalist Richard Grenell was appointed acting Director of National Intelligence, intelligence officials briefed members of Congress behind closed doors that they had \\"not concluded that the Kremlin is directly aiding any candidate‚Äôs re-election or any other candidates‚Äô election,\\" which differed from testimony they had provided the previous month indicating that Russia was working to aid Trump's candidacy. Two intelligence officials pushed back on suggestions the new testimony was politically motivated. One intelligence official asserted the earlier testimony had overreached and that Democrats had mischaracterized it. Kash Patel, a former aide to congressman Devin Nunes who joined Grenell at the ODNI, imposed limits on what intelligence officials could tell Congress about foreign influence operations. The briefers reportedly did not intend to contradict their previous testimony, though they avoided repeating it. Trump and his surrogates asserted that China, rather than Russia, posed the greater risk to election security and was trying to help Biden win. In August 2020, Trump tweeted that \\"Chinese State Media and Leaders of CHINA want Biden to win ‚Äòthe U.S. Election.\\"‚Äù Donald Trump Jr. asserted at the August Republican convention that \\"Beijing Biden is so weak on China that the intelligence community recently assessed that the Chinese Communist Party favors Biden.‚Äù Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe stated during an August Fox News appearance, \\"China is using a massive and sophisticated influence campaign that dwarfs anything that any other country is doing.\\" Attorney general Bill Barr and national security advisor Robert O'Brien made similar assertions. Intelligence community officials have publicly and privately said that the underlying intelligence indicates that while China would prefer Trump not be reelected, the nation had not been actively interfering and that Russia remained the far greater threat, working to undermine Biden. Trump also asserted that China was trying to stoke race protests in an effort to help Biden, which was also not supported by the intelligence community's assessment. === Putin administration reaction === Although Russia denied it had interfered in the 2016 election or that it was interfering in the 2020 election. On September 25, 2020, Putin released a formal statement seeking mutual \\"guarantees of non-interference\\" in U.S. and Russian elections and asking the United States \\"to approve a comprehensive program of practical measures to reset our relations in the use of information and communication technologies (ICT).\\" ==Presidency of Donald Trump== In a June 2019 interview with George Stephanopoulos, President Donald Trump said that he would accept information from other nations about his opponents in the 2020 United States presidential election. According to reporting by The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The New York Times, Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, leading to the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal. Biden is a potentially strong Trump challenger in the 2020 presidential election. The purpose of the requested investigation was alleged to be to damage Biden's election campaign for president. Reports suggested that Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless they investigate Biden. The controversy triggered the commencement of the formal process of impeachment inquiries against Trump on September 24, with House speaker Nancy Pelosi directing six House committee chairmen to proceed \\"under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry\\". On October 3, 2019, Trump said that \\"China should start an investigation\\" into presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Moments before, while discussing negotiations on a possible agreement in the ongoing China‚ÄìUnited States trade war, he said that \\"if they [China] don't do what we want, we have tremendous power.\\" Chair of the Federal Election Commission Ellen Weintraub then retweeted a June statement explaining that \\"it is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election\\". , there is evidence President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, U.S. Attorney General William Barr, as well as Trump's personal attorney Giuliani have solicited help from Ukraine and China for assistance in discrediting Trump's political opponents. Trump also dispatched Barr to meet with Italian officials as part of Trump's efforts to discredit the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump also pressed Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia to give Barr information that Trump hoped would discredit the Mueller inquiry, in a call that (like Trump's earlier call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky), used diplomatic contacts to advance Trump's \\"personal political interests.\\" According to a report in the Times of London, Trump also personally contacted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek help to discredit the Mueller investigation. A Department of Homeland Security intelligence bulletin, warning about Russian interference in the 2020 election, was planned for release on July 9 but was blocked by acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf's chief of staff. The bulletin, intended to be distributed among law-enforcement agencies, indicated that Russian disinformation operations would denigrate the mental health of Joe Biden. ==See also== *Cold Civil war *Cold War II *Cyberwarfare and Iran *Cyberwarfare by Russia *Cyberwarfare by China *Democratic National Committee cyber attacks *Foreign electoral intervention *Presidency of Donald Trump *Russian espionage in the United States *Social media in the 2016 United States presidential election *Social media in the 2020 United States presidential election *1996 United States campaign finance controversy ==References== Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:2020 elections in the United States Category:Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Foreign electoral intervention Category:Internet manipulation and propaganda Category:Trump administration controversies Category:Information operations and warfare ","title":"Russian interference in the 2020 United States elections"},{"id":"61354193","text":"350px The Seine at Port-Marly, Piles of Sand (French La Seine √† Port-Marly, tas de sable) is an 1875 painting by Alfred Sisley. It was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1900 whilst in the collection of Dr. Georges Viau, a Paris dentist and art collector. By 4 March 1907 it was owned by Durand-Ruel, who tried and failed to auction it on 4 March that year. It was bought by the galerie Bernheim-Jeune in April 1920 and later by Martin A. Ryerson. In 1933 Ryerson left it to its present owner, the Art Institute of Chicago, where it is now in section 201 (Impressionists) on the 1st floor of the Art Institute of Chicago. As in his Drying Nets and The Seine at Argenteuil of three years earlier, it shows the River Seine as a workplace near Port-Marly. This contrasts with most of the rest of his work which - like the other Impressionists - showed the Seine as a place of leisure.

After competing in dark matches and Dragon Gate house shows for months, Nakamura's first televised appearance was a loss to Big R Shimizu on May 23, 2016 on a Dragon Gate Nex show. Shortly after his debut, Nakamura was announced as a participant in the 2016 Summer Adventure Tag League, where he would be partnered with Dragon Gate veteran Masaaki Mochizuki. After taking a lariat from Shingo Takagi on August 21, Nakamura developed a concussion and he and Mochizuki were forced to drop out of the tournament. Nakamura returned in September at the Dangerous Gate pay-per-view, teaming with Don Fujii, El Lindaman and Shun Watanabe to defeat Gamma, Kaito Ishida, Takehiro Yamamura and Hyo Watanabe. On November 10 in Korakuen Hall, Nakamura was renamed to Ben-K, based on the legend of 12th century warrior monk Sait≈ç Musashib≈ç Benkei. In his first match as Ben-K, he and Shun Watanabe (now known as Shun Skywalker) lost to Jimmy Susumu and Jimmy Kagetora. On December 25 at Final Gate 2016, he got his first title shot in Dragon Gate, pairing up with Kotoka and Masato Yoshino to challenge for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship in a three-way match won by the Jimmyz (Jimmy Kanda, Jimmy Susumu and Ryo \\"Jimmy\\" Saito). In early 2017, Naruki Doi and Big R Shimizu made a call to the entire roster, looking for a third man to help them challenge for the Triangle Gate belts. Ben accepted, and on March 20, they defeated VerserK (Shingo Takagi, T-Hawk and \\"brother\\" Yasshi) to win the vacant titles. On May 4, Doi and Yoshino announced the formation of their new stable, known as \\"MaxiMuM\\", with Kotoka, Big R Shimizu and Ben-K announced as the members, along with themselves. During May, Ben-K took part in his first King of Gate tournament, but struggled greatly, earning just one win over Yosuke‚ô•Santa Maria. On July 1, MaxiMuM dropped the Triangle Gate titles to VerserK (Shingo Takagi, El Lindaman and Takashi Yoshida). On November 3 at the Gate of Destiny, Ben-K and Big R Shimizu, who called themselves \\"Big Ben\\", unsuccessfully challenged Cima and Dragon Kid for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. On February 11, 2018, he received a non-title singles match against then Open the Dream Gate Champion Masaaki Mochizuki, in which he dominated and beat the champion in just over two minutes. After the match, he challenged Mochizuki to a match for the Dream Gate title, which was accepted and set up for March 4 at Champion Gate in Osaka. After 23 minutes, Ben-K lost a hard-fought bout by referee's decision and failed to capture the title. On May 6 at Dead or Alive, Big Ben won the Twin Gate championships, defeating Antias (Eita and T-Hawk). Ben-K once again entered the King of Gate tournament in 2018 and fared much better than the previous year. He earned 5 points, however, a loss to Yamato eliminated him. On July 22 at Kobe World Pro Wrestling Festival, Big Ben lost the Twin Gate titles to Tribe Vanguard (BxB Hulk and Yamato) and not long after Big R Shimizu turned his back on MaxiMuM and joined heel unit Antias, effectively breaking up Big Ben. However, the break-up would not last long, as on September 6 in Korakuen, Ben-K himself turned heel for the first time in his career, betraying MaxiMuM to join Antias with Big R.  R.E.D. (2018‚Äì2019)  Less than a month after Ben-K joined, Antias was renamed to R.E.D. with Eita taking over as the leader, and on September 24, Ben-K challenged his former friend and MaxiMuM stablemate Masato Yoshino to a match for his Open the Dream Gate Championship, which Yoshino accepted. In his second shot at the title, Ben was defeated by Yoshino at The Gate of Destiny on November 4. On December 23 at Final Gate, Big Ben won the vacant Twin Gate titles in a four-way match. In January, Shimizu accidentally attacked Ben-K during a match and almost cost his team the victory in their match against MaxiMuM. This led to tension between Shimizu and Eita, with the rest of the group siding with Eita and turning their back on Shimizu. On February 10, Big Ben were wrestling against Kai and U-T when Eita cost them the match by hitting Ben-K with a chair. This led to Ben-K being the only R.E.D. member to side with Shimizu. On March 3, Big Ben defeated U-T and Kai in a rematch, this time with the Twin Gate titles on the line. On March 7, Ben accidentally caused R.E.D. to lose a four-way sixteen-man tag team elimination match by attacking Yasushi Kanda. With Dead or Alive coming up, general manager Takayuki Yagi announced that there would be a series of tag team matches putting members of every unit against each other, with the member who earned the pinfall representing their team in the Dead or Alive steel cage match. On April 10, Big Ben defeated Eita and Takashi Yoshida, with Shimizu pinning Eita and earning his way into Dead or Alive. In the lead up to Dead or Alive, Big Ben would finally drop the Twin Gate titles after Eita once again cost them the match by hitting Ben with a chair on April 28. At Dead or Alive on May 6, Eita and Ben attempted to put their differences aside and co-exist in a tag match against MaxiMuM's Kaito Ishida and Masato Yoshino, however, Ben finally had enough and speared Eita during the match, purposefully costing them the win. Later in the night, Big R was defeated in Dead or Alive, and by stipulation was forced to kick a member out of R.E.D. Expecting him to pick Eita, Ben was blindsided when the rest of the group attacked him and kicked him out of the group, revealing all tensions between Shimizu and Eita had been an elaborate ruse to get Ben, whom they viewed as the \\"weak link\\", kicked out of R.E.D. This subsequently turned Ben face.  Open the Dream Gate Champion (2019‚Äìpresent)  After being kicked out of R.E.D., Ben-K declared himself a lone wolf, and chose not to join any other stables. He entered the King of Gate for the third time and dominated, going undefeated in all his block matches and beating Kzy to reach the final, where he beat Eita to win the 2019 King of Gate. In the process, he became the first and so far only wrestler to ever win the tournament without losing a single match. After winning, Ben challenged former stablemate Pac to his third match for the Open the Dream Gate Championship. On July 21 at Kobe World Pro Wrestling Festival, Ben defeated Pac to win the Dream Gate title for the first time in his career. Ben-K lost the championship to Naruki Doi at Final Gate 2019 on December 15. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Dragon Gate **Open the Dream Gate Championship (1 time) **Open the Triangle Gate Championship (2 times, current) ‚Äì with Big R Shimizu and Naruki Doi (1), with Strong Machine J and Dragon Dia (1, current) **Open the Twin Gate Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Big R Shimizu (2) **King of Gate (2019) * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** Ranked No. 273 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2019http://www.profightdb.com/pwi-500/2019.html == References  External links == * Category:1991 births Category:Japanese male professional wrestlers Category:People from Sakura, Chiba Category:Living people ","title":"Ben-K"},{"id":"61354241","text":"The Oudeschans, or Oude Schans (Old Rampart), originally the Nieuwe Gracht, is a wide canal in the eastern part of the inner city of Amsterdam. ==Location== The Oudeschans canal continues the line of the Zwanenburgwal, to which it is connected by the Sint Antoniesluis, a lock that is crossed by the bridge where Sint Antoniesbreestraat turns into Jodenbreestraat. It runs northeast to the Oosterdok, which in turn is connected to the IJ. The 16th-century Montelbaanstoren is on the canal, which is sometimes called the Montelbaansgracht. The canal forms the western shore of the city island of Uilenburg on the border of the Lastage neighborhood . The quays on either side of the canal are called Oudeschans, with the exception of the section between the Waalseilandgracht and the Oosterdok at the Prins Hendrikkade. There, the northeastern quay is called the Kalkmarkt and the opposite quay is called 's-Gravenhekje. Next to house number 10 there is a \\"corridor\\" to a back area on which the De Waag Playground is located. The artist Su Tomesen designed a gateway for this. The Snoekjesgracht, Rechtboomssloot and Waalseilandgracht open into the Oudeschans from the northwest. The Houtkopersburgwal and Rapenburgwal open into it from the southeast. The odd-numbered southeast side of the Oudeschans lies on the island of Uilenburg, which can only be reached via three bridges: *From the direction of Nieuwmarkt via Keizersbrug (bridge no. 286) at Korte Koningsstraat. *From the direction of Jodenbreestraat via Steenvoetsluis (bridge 291) at the Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat / Houtkopersburgwal, *From the direction of Prins Hendrikkade / Rapenburg via the Peperbrug (bridge 281) at the Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat / Peperstraat. The Montelbaansbrug (bridge no. 280) is an extension of the even-numbered side of the Oudeschans over the Waalseilandsgracht at the Oude Waal and the Binnenkant. The Kikkerbilssluis (bridge no. 279) spans the water of the Oudeschans at the Prins Hendrikkade. ==History== The Lastage between the Oudeschans (left) and Geldersekade. Detail of a woodcut by Cornelis Anthonisz. from 1544. The Oudeschans (bottom right of the center) has become part of the city. On the right the Lastage; on the left the islands of Uilenburg and Valkenburg. Detail of van Berckenrode map from 1625. In 1512, troops from Guelders attacked the city and plundered the Lastage, the industrial area with shipyards on the eastern side outside the city. Between 1515 and 1518 an armof the Amstel was dug out, the Zwanenburgwal, leading to the Nieuwe Gracht, as the Oudeschans was then called. This became the defensive moat for the east side of the city. A defensive wall was thrown up with the earth dug out, on which a wooden palisade was erected. The Montelbaan tower was built in 1516 as part of this defensive work. At the end of the 16th century, during the Second Expansion, three islands southeast of the Nieuwe Gracht were included: Uilenburg, Marken (later called Valkenburg ) and Rapenburg. When a new city wall was erected to defend against the Spanish, it included the new islands. The Nieuwe Gracht and the old redoubt lost its defensive function. In 1602 a channel was cut through the Sint Antoniesdijk on the south side of the Oudeschans, and the Sint Antoniesluis (a lock) was built so that ships could sail to the Amstel via the Zwanenburgwal. The West-Indian warehouse is on the 's-Gravenhekje, where the Oudeschans flows into the Oosterdok. This monumental complex, built in 1642, was the headquarters of the Dutch West India Company between 1646 and 1674. In 1833, after a rumor that ghosts had been seen, the Oudeschans was nicknamed the ghost quay. The Oudeschans and the parallel Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat, were located in the heart of the old Jodenbuurt (Jewish neighborhood) of Amsterdam. In 1927 the municipality built a block of 72 homes in the style of the late Amsterdam School in collaboration with the Bouwfonds Handwerkers Vriendenkring. The block was designed by Jan Hendrik Mulder Jr. (1888‚Äì1960) and built on the Oudeschans / Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat. The ground floor areas, with the monumental natural stone entrance at Oudeschans 21, were originally designed as storage for the goods, stalls and carts of the Jewish street market on Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat, which was popular before World War II. The complex is used as an exhibition and studio space, and offers space for artists and young entrepreneurs. The Korendrager warehouse on Oudeschans 73-77 was destroyed by fire in 1949. Between 1974 and 2004, the Bimhuis stood here. When this concert hall for jazz and improvised music had found a new home in the Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ, an apartment building was built on the site in 2007 based on a design by Tekton architects. ==Notable residents== Jan Swammerdam lived at Oudeschans 18, where his father, who was known for his natural history collection, had a pharmacy . Between 1887-1888, the painter Willem Witsen rented the studio in Oudeschans 5 formerly used by George Hendrik Breitner. The Montelbaanstoren and Oudeschans were a favorite subject that he drew and painted from his window.

She was elected an American Association for the Advancement of Science Leshner Leadership Institute Fellow in 2019. == Early life and education == Stirling studied engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, completing her master's degree in 2005. She earned her PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2008. After graduating, Stirling completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Boston Children's Hospital. She moved to the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University in 2009, where she worked as Director of the Motion Capture Lab. Here she worked on robotic devices that could improve the function of the hads of people who had suffered from stroke or cerebral palsy. == Research and career == Stirling joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013, where she co-directs the Human Systems Lab. She works on human‚Äìcomputer interaction and computational dynamics. She looks to quantify the fluency of humans and machines in tightly coupled systems through the use of wearable sensors. She works on how to map wearable sensor information to a visible display. This information can help in the design of spacesuits, as well as helping people who have sensory disorders identify ways to interact with their environment. In the design of spacesuits, Stirling has studied whether haptic feedback could be used to help astronauts feel around their environments. Amongst these sensors, Stirling is interested in using them for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Stirling believes that the development of high fidelity sensors will help rehabilitation survivors monitor their well-being and performance. Stirling is interested in the use of exoskeletons for humans to enhance performance and reduce workplace injuries. Whilst exoskeletons have been proposed for use in the military, Stirling identified that they can reduce soldier's response times. Stirling serves on the ASTM International F48 Committee on Exoskeletons and Exosuits. In 2019 Stirling was selected as an American Association for the Advancement of Science Leshner Leadership Institute Fellow. She leads public engagement activities at the MIT Museum, including leading a wearable technology challenge for teachers and high school students. == References == Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:University of Illinois alumni ","title":"Leia Stirling"},{"id":"61354680","text":"Centralia High School is a public secondary school in Centralia, Missouri.

Designed for consumption on smartphones in either audiobook or e-book format, users can read or listen to each weekly episodic installment. The installments are typically 25 minutes to read or about an hour to listen, and are delivered to consumers via mobile apps. The company produces original fiction with a focus on science fiction, fantasy, mystery, crime and thrillers. Users can use the Serial Box mobile app to access both audio and text and even toggle between them. NPR stated that Serial Box aimed to be \\"HBO for readers\\" and BuzzFeed named it a must-have app in 2017. ==History== In September 2015, Julian Yap and Molly Barton launched Serial Box. The first production was Bookburners, created by Max Gladstone. The writing process was based on television serials rather than novels. Founder Yap realized that he was reading fewer novels due to time constraints from work. Both Yap and Barton believe that serialized fiction will make reading more accessible and social. ==Process== Serial Box hires a lead author, or showrunner, write a pilot episode and a \\"show bible\\" which will outline the plot for each season. After this, Serial Box brings together a team of writers who will contribute ideas in a manner similar to a television writers' room. At the end of this period, each author is assigned episodes to write. Whereas a novel generally takes 2‚Äì3 years to be written and published, a Serial Box production can be completed 6 months from the start date. Because the first episode is published before the season is completed, the authors can tailor the ending of the season to the audience's reactions. It is the responsibility of the showrunner to ensure that all episodes maintain a consistent writing style despite the involvement of multiple authors. ==Awards== Molly Barton, Jeff Li, James Stuart, and Julian Yap were nominated for the 2019 World Fantasy Professional Award for their work with Serial Box. ==Serial Box Original Productions== {  - !

From 1899 to 1900 he was a special student in the College of Forestry at Cornell University. From 1906 to 1913 he was employed as a forester in the Philippines by the Bureau of Forestry based in Manila. In 1906 the authorized force of the Bureau consisted of one director, 10 clerical staff, and a field staff consisting of 13 foresters, 6 assistant foresters, 23 rangers, and a manager of the timber-testing laboratory. In 1912 he returned to the United States and married Marian Elma Hege (widow of Samuel Augustus Pfohl, who died in 1903). Their marriage occurred on 27 June 1912 in Forsyth County, North Carolina. Their first son, Hugh M. Curran, Jr., was born in 1913 in Buenos Aires; their second son was born there in 1914; their daughter was born in Washington D.C. in 1917. Hugh M.

Joining the factory after World War I, by 1944 she was managing a team of women in the coil winding shop. Papers accompanying her medal suggest that she was involved in making secret radio sets used by the resistance during the war. Women working at Marconi in the 1950s (Chelmsford Museum) == Work == Florence Attridge joined the coil winding shop at the Marconi New Street factory in Chelmsford just after World War I. Guglielmo Marconi, who is often credited with being the inventor of radio, built the factory in 1912. In 1920 the factory played host to the first experimental wireless broadcast. Attridge was involved in making key components of the radio sets - the coils, transformers, inductors and chokes. Her job was to wind wires of various sizes around frames or magnetic cores. This is where the coil winding shop got its name from. Her work was intricate and exacting, and typically the women worked 12-hour shifts. Women working at the Marconi Hall Street Works c. 1900s (Chelmsford Museum) Women played a vital role in the creation of new electrical devices in many pioneering companies such as Marconi, doing most of the assembly work. As the technology improved this work became increasingly intricate and time consuming, and it was found that women excelled at these tasks. At this time women could also be paid lower wages than men, so hiring women for assembly jobs meant more profits for the company. From the consumers‚Äô perspective however, this profit margin paved the way for the mass production of electrical goods at prices that were affordable for ordinary people. In 1946 Attridge received a British Empire Medal (civil division) for her contributions to the war effort during World War II. Front of Attridge's British Empire Medal (Chelmsford Museum) She was listed as head of the coil winding shop by this time. Papers accompanying the medal include a letter from ‚ÄòK3 section‚Äô, which was part of the Naval Intelligence code breaking section. This suggests that Attridge may have worked on the British Type 3 Mark II radio made by Marconi and used by spies during the war. Back of Florence Attridge's British Empire Medal (Chelmsford Museum) The British Type 3 Mark II radio, more commonly known as the B2, was issued to agents, resistance groups and special forces operating in occupied territory. Weighing just 8lbs it was first used in the field in 1944 and the Marconi Company made over 400 of them. The radio required specialist miniaturised components; work trusted to expert staff. Attridge would have led a small team in assembling these components, probably in a closed off area of the factory to ensure secrecy as the factory operated 24 hours a day. The British Type 3 Mark II Radio (Chelmsford Museum) === Commemorations === In 2016 Chelmsford Museum Services acquired Attridge‚Äôs British Empire Medal. With the medal came eight documents, including a signed letter from Buckingham Palace, a signed letter from the Admiralty, a signed telegram from the Admiralty signal establishment and a signed letter/telegram from Admiral H. W. Grant, then Managing Director of the Marconi Company. There was also a letter from ‚ÄòK3 section‚Äô, which was part of the Naval Intelligence code breaking section. In 2018-2019 Attridge featured in a touring exhibition celebrating the lives and achievements of Essex women. The exhibition was part of a two-year project by Essex County Council, ‚ÄòSnapping the Stiletto‚Äô, exploring how Essex women‚Äôs lives have changed since the Representation of the People Act in 1918 gave the first British women the right to vote. == Personal Life == Attridge was born in 1901 in Chelmsford. Her parents were Henry Attridge (died 1938) and Martha Jane (nee Gosling, died 1939). She had three brothers, and in 1911 the family are recorded living at 1&2 Browns Yard, Moulsham Street. Her father was a ‚Äòsteel grinder‚Äô and may well have worked at Crompton ARC in Chelmsford, before moving to Marconi. Attridge joined her father working at Marconi just after the end of the First World War. In 1950 she married John William Hayes, also of Chelmsford. She was 49 at the time of her marriage and no children are recorded. In 1975 Florence and her husband John died within a few months of each other. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Recipients of the British Empire Medal Category:Women in World War II Category:People from Chelmsford ","title":"Florence Attridge"},{"id":"61354920","text":"Leif Olsson (born 11 November 1968) is a retired Swedish football midfielder.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish footballers Category:Degerfors IF players Category:AIK Fotboll players Category:C.F.

Plans were laid out under Boris Johnson and introduced by Sadiq Khan on 8 April 2019. It led to the number of the worst polluting vehicles dropping from 35,600 to 23,000 and a 20% reduction in emissions in Central London. The zone will be expanded to cover the Inner London area within the North and South Circular roads from October 2021. ==History== Sign warning drivers that they are about to enter the Ultra Low Emission Zone and Congestion Charging Zone Plans for an ultra‚Äìlow emissions zone were under consideration since 2014 under Mayor Boris Johnson. In February 2017, Mayor Sadiq Khan announced plans to expand the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in April 2019 beyond Central London, one year ahead of schedule. Drivers do not pay both the ULEZ and the previous ¬£10 T-charge, but they are still subject to the London Congestion Charge. The money raised from the ULEZ is invested in the transport network and improving air quality in London. ==Introduction and effect== The zone was introduced in April 2019 and led to a 20% reduction in emissions by July 2019.https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/cleanair/high- pollution-levels-detected-by-40-of-londons-air-quality-sensor- networks-a4196811.html ===Effect on vehicle numbers=== The number of the worst polluting vehicles entering the zone each day dropped from 35,578, in March 2019, to 26,195 in April of the same year, after the charge was introduced. The number further dropped to 23,054 in July 2019. The proportion of vehicles which complied with the standards rose from 61% in March 2019 to 74% in September 2019.https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ulez_six_month_evaluation_report_final_oct.pdf The total number of vehicles entering Central London each day also dropped from over 102,000 in February 2017 to 89,000 in April 2019. ===Effect on air pollution=== NO2 pollution dropped five times as quickly in Central London as it did in the rest of the UK.https://www.london.gov.uk/press- releases/mayoral/5x-greater-reduction-in-toxic-no2-in-london ==Reaction== The Ultra Low Emission Zone has been described as one of the most radical anti- pollution policies in the world. A poll in April 2019 by YouGov found that 72% of Londoners supported using emissions charging to tackle both air pollution and congestion. However, the Federation of Small Businesses said that many small firms were \\"very worried about the future of their businesses\\" as a result of the \\"additional cost burden\\". ==Current charging scheme== The ¬£12.50 charge applies 24 hours a day every day of the year, and is based on European emission standards: * Motorbikes that do not meet Euro 3 standards (pre-2007 vehicles) * Petrol cars and vans that do not meet Euro 4 standards (vehicles pre-2006) * Diesel cars and vans that do not meet Euro 6 standards (vehicles pre-2015) * Buses, coaches and lorries must meet or exceed the Euro VI standard or pay ¬£100 a day All road charging schemes in London including the ULEZ and Congestion Charge will be suspended for an unknown period of time from 23 March 2020 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. ===Exemptions=== Residents of the zone will not pay the charge until October 2021 as long as they are registered for the residents' Congestion Charge Discount and meet the T-charge standards. Vehicles in the \\"disabled\\" tax class are also exempt from the charge, as are London-licensed taxis, private hire vehicles which are wheelchair accessible and historic vehicles (over 40 years old). There are also exemptions for agricultural vehicles, military vehicles, certain types of mobile cranes and non-road going vehicles which are allowed to drive on the highway (e.g. excavators).https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission- zone/discounts-and-exemptions#on-this-page-1 ==Future expansion== The zone will be expanded to cover the Inner London area inside the North and South Circular roads from October 2021 so that it would cover an area containing 3.8 million people. Once the zone is expanded, an estimated 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries will pay the charge daily. ==See also== *Clean Air Zone *https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/ulez-where-and-when *https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/ulez-expansion ==References== Category:Electronic toll collection Category:Fare collection systems in London Category:Motoring taxation in the United Kingdom Category:Road congestion charge schemes in the United Kingdom Category:Road transport in London Category:Town and country planning in London Category:Transport policy in the United Kingdom Category:Transport infrastructure in London Category:2019 in London Category:2019 introductions Congestion charge Category:Air pollution in the United Kingdom ","title":"Ultra Low Emission Zone"},{"id":"61354981","text":"Eugeniusz Ptak (born 1 September 1960) is a retired Polish football striker.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Polish footballers Category:≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw players Category:Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin players Category:Apollon Limassol FC players Category:Nea Salamis Famagusta FC players Category:VfB Oldenburg players Category:Mied≈∫ Legnica players Category:Association football forwards Category:Polish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Polish expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Polish expatriate sportspeople in Germany ","title":"Eugeniusz Ptak"},{"id":"61354989","text":"Les≈Çaw Grech (born 17 March 1972) is a retired Polish football midfielder.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Polish footballers Category:Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin players Category:≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw players Category:Lechia Zielona G√≥ra players Category:Chrobry G≈Çog√≥w players Category:G√≥rnik Polkowice players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Les≈Çaw Grech"},{"id":"61354998","text":"is a puzzle arcade video game developed by Face, with the assistance of Minato Giken, and originally published by SNK on May 25, 1994. It was the first game to be created by Face for the Neo Geo platform and it was not released on the Neo Geo AES (home). In the game, players must match 3 people with their respective colored outfit, while rotating the playfield in order to rearrange them. Though it was initially only launched for the Neo Geo MVS (arcade), Gururin was later re-released by HAMSTER Corporation through download services for various consoles in 2018. A conversion for the Neo Geo CD was planned and even previewed but it did not received an official release to the public. Gururin has garnered mixed critical reception since its original release in arcades from reviewers who felt mixed towards several aspects of the game such as the visuals, sound design and gameplay, while its difficulty and learning curve has been heavily criticized. == Gameplay == Gameplay screenshot. Gururin is a tile-matching puzzle game reminiscent of Columns and Puyo Puyo, where the player must match 3 people wearing the same color outfit vertically or horizontally in order to become warriors as the main objective. In addition to the single-player mode, the game also features a competitive two-player mode where one human competes against either a computer-controlled opponents or against other human players in versus matches to become the winner. If a memory card is present, the players are allowed to save their high-score. A unique feature of the game is the rotation of people around the playfield; By pressing A or B, players rotate the arena either to the left or the right, changing the positioning of people. On occasions, an arrow appears indicating the correct way to match 3 people of the same color. However, people can also potentially grab their hands to not let themselves go, making puzzle solving more complex and later levels increase in difficulty as well. If the people manages to occupy the playfield, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. == Development and release == Gururin served as the first project to be developed by Face for the Neo Geo platform and its creation was helmed by producer Kenichi Iwanaga. Iwanaga was also both its designer and programmer along with Kaori Hijiya, Kingo Hiraku and Noriyuki Tabata. Artists Masako Araki, Michiyo Morohoshi and Kenichi Kumakura were responsible for the pixel art, while Atsuko Iwanaga and Kenji Sugai were in charge of its sound design, among other people collaborating in its development. Gururin was initially only launched for the arcades by SNK on May 25, 1994. A Neo Geo CD version was announced and even showcased for playing to the attendees at SNK's booth during the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1995 but it was never released for unknown reasons. The game has since received a re-release in 2018 on various digital distribution platforms such as the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live as part of the ACA Neo Geo series by HAMSTER Corporation. == Reception == Gururin has been met mixed reception from critics since its initial release. AllGame's Kyle Knight criticized the visuals, sound design, difficulty and learning curve but praised the addictive gameplay and rotating mechanic. In a retrospective review, Gon√ßalo Lopes from Nintendo Life regarded the graphics and music for being surreal and psychedelic, despite being standard for the genre but criticized for being complicated for players, recommending other titles on the Neo Geo such as Magical Drop and Puzzle Bobble. In another retrospective review, Gabriel Jones of Cubed3 criticized its level of complexity and learning curve, stating that it was a stark contrast to the \\"pick up and play\\" philosophy of other arcade titles. == Notes  References  External links == * Gururin at GameFAQs * Gururin at Giant Bomb * Gururin at Killer List of Videogames * Gururin at MobyGames Category:1994 video games Category:ACA Neo Geo games Category:Arcade games Category:Cancelled Neo Geo CD games Category:Face (company) games Category:Minato Giken games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Neo Geo games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Puzzle video games Category:SNK games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Gururin"},{"id":"61355016","text":"Istv√°n Stefanov (born 19 July 1964) is a retired Hungarian football midfielder.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian footballers Category:Csepel SC footballers Category:Budapest Honv√©d FC players Category:B√©k√©scsaba 1912 El≈ëre footballers Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Istv√°n Stefanov"},{"id":"61355022","text":"The Los Angeles Jewish Symphony (LAJS) is a non-profit orchestra based in Los Angeles, California, that specializes in presenting music of the Jewish experience.

The tournament commenced on July 6 and concluded on August 12, 2019. It is the twenty-ninth edition of G1 Climax, and forty-fifth edition of the tournament counting its previous forms under different names. A Block winner Kota Ibushi defeated B Block winner Jay White in the final to win the tournament. Considered NJPW's most important tournament, the G1 Climax features twenty wrestlers, divided in two blocks of ten (\\"A\\" and \\"B\\"). Each participant faces all nine other wrestlers within the same block in singles matches. The winner of each block is determined via a point system, with two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no point for a defeat; each night of the event sees the ten members of one block compete for the tournament, while the members of the non-competing block perform in tag team matches that have no influence of the tournament results. On the final day of the event, the winners of both blocks face each other to determine the winner of the G1 Climax, who will gain a future match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Wrestle Kingdom, NJPW's biggest yearly event. The event saw the G1 Climax debut of Jeff Cobb, Jon Moxley, Taichi, Kenta, Shingo Takagi, and Will Ospreay as well as Lance Archer's first participation since 2014; this was Kenta's in-ring debut in NJPW. As usual, the tournament took place over several cities and locations; the 2019 edition marked the first time that the G1 Climax tournament took place outside of Japan, as the event opened with G1 Climax in Dallas at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, before moving back to Japan. The event was broadcast live on AXS TV in the United States, TV Asahi and Fighting TV Samurai in Japan, and New Japan Pro-Wrestling World worldwide. == Production == {class= style=\\"font- size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\\" + Other on- screen personnel !Role: !Name: - rowspan=3English Commentators Kevin Kelly - Rocky Romero - Chris Charlton (nights 2, 3, 5‚îÄ7, 13, 14, 16‚îÄ19) - rowspan=12Japanese Commentators Shinpei Nogami (nights 18 & 19) - Shigeki Kiyono (nights 2, 3, 8‚îÄ10) - Yohei Onishi (nights 1 & 4) - Shunichiro Fujisawa (nights 5‚îÄ7, 12, 15) - Haruo Murata (nights 11, 13, 14, 16) - Shinji Yoshino (night 17) - Milano Collection A.T. - Miki Motoi (nights 1, 3, 5, 15, 18) - Yusuke Okamoto (nights 7 & 12) - Katsuhiko Kanazawa (nights 4, 6, 19) - Soichi Shibata (night 2) - Kazuo Yamazaki (night 17) - rowspan=2Ring announcers Kimihiko Ozaki - Makoto Abe - rowspan=4Referees Kenta Sato - Marty Asami - Red Shoes Unno - Tiger Hattori - } === Tournament rules === NJPW announced that the 2019 edition and its dates of the G1 Climax on January 4, 2019 at Wrestle Kingdom 13; it was announced that the first night of the tournament will be held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, marking the first time the tournament would be held outside of Japan. As per usual G1 Climax tradition, the tournament features twenty wrestlers, divided in two blocks of ten (\\"A\\" and \\"B\\"). Each participant faces all nine other wrestler within the same block in singles match, with the winner of each block being determined via a point system, gaining two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no point for a loss; each night of the event sees the ten members of a same block compete for the tournament, while the members of the non-competing block perform in tag team matches that have no influence of the tournament results, typically facing their future tournament opponents. In case of several wrestler sharing the top score, the results of the matches those wrestlers had when facing each others in the tournament act as tiebreaker, with the one having the most wins over the other top-scorers determining the winner of the block. On the final day of the event, the respective winners of both blocks face each other to determine the winner of the G1 Climax, who would gain a future match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, NJPW's top championship, at Wrestle Kingdom, NJPW's biggest yearly event; if the IWGP Heavyweight Champion himself wins, he gets to pick his opponent at Wrestle Kingdom. The low-card matches have a twenty-minutes time limit, while the matches of the tournament have a 30-minutes time limit (with the time limit being reached resulting in a tie); the final match between the two block winners has no time limit. === Storylines === The event includes matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. First-time participant Jeff Cobb and returning participant Tomohiro Ishii announced their participation to the tournament on May 31, 2019. On June 9, 2019 at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall, several wrestlers announced their decision to participate in the G1 Climax for the first time, including IWGP United States Champion Jon Moxley.

It was good, brutal fun to watch, but it also pointed a way forward for Moxley not just as an attraction, but rather as a brilliant and brilliantly violent wrestler.\\" Many of the tournament's matches were acclaimed, with eight of them attaining a rating of five or more stars by wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer. ==ReferencesExternal links== *G1 Climax at NJPW.co.jp Category:New Japan Pro-Wrestling tournaments Category:New Japan Pro-Wrestling shows Category:2019 in professional wrestling Category:July 2019 events in the United States Category:July 2019 events in Japan Category:August 2019 events in Japan Category:2019 in Texas Category:2019 in Japan Category:Events in Dallas Category:Events in Tokyo Category:Events in Sapporo Category:Events in Osaka Category:Professional wrestling in Texas Category:Professional wrestling in Tokyo Category:Professional wrestling in Osaka ","title":"G1 Climax 29"},{"id":"61355163","text":"William H.

She was part of the 2018 Edinburgh Art Festival with Biodiversity in collaboration with Glasgow artist and writer Alasdair Gray. She has had two more collaborative exhibitions with Gray including and developing the theme of biodiversity. Her work is often inspired by rare species of flora and fauna, some from the Gal√°pagos Islands where Healy made a research trip to Charles Darwin Research Station in 2017. Another strand of Healy's research is highlighting obscure museum collections such as the Illuminating Letters exhibition at The Lighthouse, Glasgow Centre of Design Excellence, in which Healy highlighted the personal letters of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and combined and collaged text and imagery with personal correspondence that Healy had received from David Attenborough. For the Amazon series Outlander (TV series) she was commissioned to make specialist glassware. Healy currently works at Glasgow Sculpture Studios. == Publications == * Myth/Reality.

He has served as Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Chief Strategic Advisor since July 2019, having been Chief of Staff and Deputy Mayor for Policy and Planning under Johnson during the latter's time as Mayor of London. == Early life and education == Lister was born on 25 October 1949, to George and Margot Udny-Lister. He was educated at London Nautical School. ==Business career== Lister joined Mather and Platt Alarms in 1969 as a trainee, and rose to become Commercial Director. In 1979 he moved to Britannia Security as Sales Manager. In 1987 he joined ADT Fire & Security, initially as Major Projects Director, and from 1990 as general manager. ADT at this time was controlled and led by Lord Ashcroft. In 1997 ADT was purchased by Tyco. From 1997 to 2007 Lister was Director, Government Relations, for Tyco Fire & Security. In the early years of this period Tyco was known for its very hard-driving and cost-conscious operational management culture, under Dennis Kozlowski. ==Public service career== Lister was first elected to Wandsworth Council in 1976. From 1992 to 2011, Lister was the leader of Wandsworth Council. His approach was regarded as congruent with Thatcherism, and he supported adapting policy to local conditions. Critics have called Lister a 'right-wing uber-privatiser' who privatised street cleaning and refuse collection, and sold off council housing. Wandsworth was one of the earliest councils to take such actions. Between 2007 and 2010 only 11% of the \\"affordable\\" homes built in Wandsworth were for social rent ‚Äì the lowest in the whole of London. Many ex-council homes became owned by concentrated and absent private landlords. Lister has been criticised for defending bankers and other wealthy Londoners, saying it would be \\"really bad news\\" for London if they left. He has similarly been criticised for high focus on cutting costs. Others have said he made Wandsworth the most successful value for money local authority in the country, with the country's lowest council tax charge and top satisfaction ratings from its residents. In 2019, Wandsworth's council tax remained the lowest in the UK, which the council ascribed to continued cost focus. From 2007 to 2019, Lister was a Director of Localis, a think-tank focused on local government issues, and particularly localism. In 2008 Lister carried out a financial audit of City Hall finances for Mayor Boris Johnson. In 2011, following the death of Simon Milton, Lister was appointed as Chief of Staff and Deputy Mayor for Policy and Planning at the Greater London Authority, under Boris Johnson who was Mayor of London. He served until 2016. One area of focus was long-term infrastructure planning. After leaving City Hall, he took up the role of Chairman of Homes England, and also served as a non-executive director at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, including during the time that Boris Johnson served as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and other board roles. In August 2019 Lister stepped down from his position at Homes England in order to focus on his newly-created role as Chief Strategy Advisor to Prime Minister Johnson. As well as detailed operational management, Lister played an important role in some aspects of Brexit diplomacy. Lister is believed to have indicated that he may not stay in the role after Brexit is resolved. ===Approach and key skills=== Lister has said he desires to understand the operations he is responsible for; \\"If I'm to do the job properly, I've got to understand it, how it works, what makes it tick.\\" His focus is on value; \\"Firstly, it's got to be about value for money, that's absolutely essential.\\" His key skill is operational delivery; \\"I just want to get the thing done. That's what I'm good at. The organising and doing and making it happen.\\" Lister is regarded as well-organised, and adept at managing underlying relationships.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-24/johnson- installs-cool-calm-eddie-lister-as-senior-adviser == Personal life == Lister married Eileen Elizabeth McHugh in 1979. They have a son and a daughter. Their other son, Andrew, died in 2011 in Thailand, reportedly of a heart attack. == Honours == Lister was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2011 Birthday Honours, \\"for services to local government\\". He received the accolade on 30 November 2011. == References == Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:People educated at the London Nautical School Category:British political consultants Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Knights Bachelor ","title":"Edward Lister"},{"id":"61355322","text":"On a Distant Shore is an album by singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Leon Russell.

Montenegro acquired its independence in 2006 and Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008. As such, there was no border agreement between them. The diplomatic negotiations between the governments of Kosovo and Montenegro came under heavy criticism in both countries. Around 8,000 hectares, or 20,000 acres, of land stretching 60 km had remained disputed. An article by Saudi Gazette stated it was roughly 18,900 acres. Montenegros prime minister Milo Djukanovic stated that \\"Montenegro does not even need one meter from the territory of Kosovo\\". The border demarcation deal with Montenegro was one of the explicit requirements by the European Parliament for the visa liberalization process for Kosovo. In 2015, Ramush Haradinaj insisted that the 1974 Yugoslav borders were necessary in order to continue the good relations with Montenegro. The agreement was ratified by both governments in 2015 and was enforced March 2018 leading to √áakorr, an Albanian region symbolizing patriotism, being handed over to Montenegro. The president of Kosovo Hashim Tha√ßi and Montenegro's prime minister signed the agreement on February 17, 2018. It was ratified in the Kosovan parliament a month later. The agreement has been criticized as the prohibition to travel within the Schengen area had been lifted for more severe border issues amongst Georgia and Ukraine but not for Kosovo with its less severe border issues. == Debate == A villager named Hajdaraj stated that \\"they have taken away land that been passed from father to son for generations; we have graves here, the graves of our forefathers who fought on the other side of the border\\". Villagers in the Rugova valley vowed to take up arms if the government continued to ignore them. In 2016, The L√´vizja Vet√´vendosje accused PDK party of for the agreement of the Border Demarcation with Montenegro. Prime minister Isa Mustafa met the Rugova locals opposing the demarcation in 2016. A local stated that the prime minister did not say anything about the matter. Levizja Vetendesojes party leader Albin Kurti held a protest speech with 2000 activists leading to the postponing of the demarcation in the Kosovo parliament. In August 2015, prime minister Ramush Haradinaj criticized the demarcation. Four years later, in 2019, he met Muj√´ Rugova, to discuss the finalization of the demarcation. Ibrahim Rugova warned of the demarcation already in 2002. == Attacks == On August 28, 2015, a RTK employee suffered a second attack in his home by a group that opposed the demarcation. An unknown indiviudual tossed an explosive device inside resulting in no one being hurt. A group called Rugovasit claimed both attacks warning of more victims if the government continued to ignore the opposition. On August 30, six opposition supporters were detained by the police on suspicion of involvement in a rocket-propelled grenade attack on parliament. The European and International Federations of Journalists (EFJ/IFJ) condemned the attacks. Violent protests occurred in Pristina with riot police being attacked with molotovs. An article by Kosovapress writes that the Rugova locals attacked RTK because it supported the demarcation. == International reports == Independent Balkan News Agency published an article explaining that international experts, appointed by Atifete Jahjaga, stated that the demarcation did not breach any laws. The opposition criticized the commission of being too similar to previous commissions. Both Albanian and Montenegrin locals around the borders stated that the politicians should take into consideration the opinions of the public. A report from Saferworld titled Drawing boundaries in the Western Balkans: A people‚Äôs perspective published in 2011 states that failure to resolve demarcation issues and raise border-control standards likewise ensures that parts of the region maintain a reputation for being vulnerable to transnational organised crime, smuggling and people trafficking. == References == Category:2015 in Montenegro Category:2015 in Kosovo Category:Land disputes ","title":"Kosovo-Montenegro border demarcation"},{"id":"61355341","text":"The 72nd Writers Guild of America Awards honored the best writing in film, television and radio of 2019.

William Shupe moved his family to Carson in 1912, and together with others built an irrigation ditch, the Arroyo Aguaje de la Petaca, which enabled irrigation of the Carson area. The Shupe family grew pinto beans on . Troy Shupe, one of his sons, was contracted to build the schoolhouse, and Verde Shupe, another son, hauled water, stone and lumber used in the structure. A stonemason, Mr. Willis, shaped the native basalt rock quarried from nearby. The school is the only surviving one of several works by Mr. Willis in the area. About 40 students attended the school at its peak, when the Carson community had a population of about 150. The schoolhouse also served for Mormon church services, and occasionally for funerals. After 1932, when the education was consolidated away, the building was used for community activities such as dances, potluck dinners, and country fairs.

Between 2002 and 2012, Mitchell maintained the blog The Buddha is My DJ where he wrote about his research, American Buddhism, racism, and engaged in debate with other Buddhist bloggers of the time, including the \\"Angry Asian Buddhist.\\"McGuire, Beverley Foulks. \\"The Way of the Blogisattva: Buddhist Blogs on the Web,\\" in Grieve, Gregory P. Grieve and Daniel M. Veidlinger, eds., Buddhism, the Internet, and Digital Media: The Pixel in the Lotus. New York: Routledge, 2015. Since 2008 he has been cohost of the DharmaRealm podcast with Rev.

By October 2018, after the film's opening weekend, McBride confirmed that early development on a sequel had begun.

On August 30, 2019, it was announced that Kyle Richards would reprise her role as Lindsey Wallace from the original film. In August 2019, Charles Cyphers was rumored to reprise his role as Sheriff Leigh Brackett from the original film and its 1981 sequel.

Scagnoli (1922‚Äì2015) was an American government official who served as deputy mayor and fire commissioner during the administration of Boston Mayor John F. Collins. ==Early life== Scagnoli was born on May 6, 1922 in Jamaica Plain. He graduated from Jamaica Plain High School in 1939. During high school he took a typing and dictation class at the urging of his mother. As a result, he was assigned to an office job at a naval base in Newfoundland during World War II. ==Business career== After the war, Scagnoli worked for an insurance firm. In 1949 he married a co-worker, Mary Daly. He attended night classes at Northeastern University on the GI Bill and graduated with a degree in management in 1952. He eventually left the insurance business to become an executive with Waldo Brothers, a building supply business. ==Politics== In 1946, Scagnoli campaigned for a state representative candidate in Jamaica Plain. That candidate lost to John F. Collins. Scagnoli grew to admire Collins and when he ran for a seat in the Massachusetts Senate in 1950, Scagnoli managed his campaign. Scagnoli managed Collins' campaign in the 1959 Boston mayoral election, which saw Collins defeat Senate President John E. Powers in what was seen as one of the city's biggest political upsets. On December 20, 1959, Mayor-elected Collins named Scagnoli to the position of fire commissioner. He was sworn in on January 4, 1960. At the age of 37, Scagnoli was the youngest person appointed to the position. As commissioner, Scagnoli led a \\"space heater research program\\", which cut space heater deaths from 15 in the winter of 1959-60 to 0 in 1960-61. In 1961, Scagnoli became director of administrative services, a position also referred to as deputy mayor. In this role, Collins tasked Scagnoli with balancing the city's payroll and reducing the number of civil servants. From 1960 to 1966, the city eliminated 1450 positions, however these efforts were undermined somewhat by the school committee, which added 874. In 1962, Scagnoli was a finalist for the position of Boston police commissioner, but Collins opted to appoint FBI agent Edmund McNamara instead. In July 1966, Scagnoli was appointed acting fire commissioner following the death of Thomas Griffin. He continued to serve a dual role as deputy mayor and fire commissioner until William J. Fitzgerald was sworn in on August 17. In October 1966, Scagnoli stepped down as deputy mayor for the lower paying position of deputy school construction engineer. He remained with the Boston Public Schools' planning and engineering department for over two decades. ==Later life== After Mary Scagnoli's health began to fail, the couple moved to an assisted living facility in West Roxbury. After her death in 2007, he remained at the facility, where, as one of the more active residents, he assisted other residents by driving them short distance. Scagnoli died on May 3, 2015 after falling ill with pneumonia. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American campaign managers Category:American naval personnel of World War I Category:Commissioners of the Boston Fire Department Category:Northeastern University alumni Category:People from Jamaica Plain ","title":"Henry Scagnoli"},{"id":"61355659","text":"Ulrich \\"Uli\\" Sutor (born May 9, 1960) is a former German curler and curling coach.

It began with a vision shared by three spiritual people: one Lakota and two Anishinaabe. The pipe stands on the grounds of the historic Rock Island Railroad depot near the entrance to Pipestone National Monument, home to the Keepers of the Sacred Tradition of Pipemakers. The location of the giant peace pipe is significant; the pipestone quarry nearby is known as \\"the crossroads of the Indian world.\\" The soft red catlinite from the quarry has been used by American Indians for thousands of years to create ceremonial peace pipes. == Origin == In the 1990s, three spiritual people from different Native tribes had the same dream within a two-year period. Art Zimmiga, a Lakota from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, was the first. He came to Pipestone to write a business plan for the Keepers of the Sacred Tradition of Pipemakers. To wish success to the new organization, Zimmiga presented founder Bud Johnston (Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa) with an eagle feather from his medicine bundle. To many indigenous people, the eagle feather represents the gateway to the Creator. On his way back to Pine Ridge, Zimmiga had a day vision. He saw a huge pipe that could produce smoke. In his vision, elders were giving gifts. Each time they offered a gift, smoke came out of the big pipe. About six months later, a Midi Anishinaabe woman named Lisa Dietz from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, shared a similar vision. She was a member of a group of spiritual people who blessed the depot building upon the formation of the Keepers of the Sacred Tradition of Pipemakers in 1996 and presented an eagle feather. She also had a dream of a giant pipe and encouraged the building of it. A few months later, Bud Johnston's oldest son, Bill, came home to Pipestone on a visit from Spokane, Washington. While visiting the depot, Bill had a vision about building a huge piece pipe. He sent his father a drawing of the pipe, and the two men discussed what it would take to build it. Bill envisioned the pipe to be about long. He made a scaled drawing and determined that the it could be made out of steel well casing in diameter and where the bowl and stem fit together. Bill purchased the steel and his father flew out to Spokane to begin work on the sculpture. Bud invited his youngest son, John, a meticulous welder, to help with the creation of the pipe. The pipe was designed as a \\"four winds\\" pipe, with four rings welded onto the bowl to honor the four directions from which Native people have come to Pipestone. == Installation == Once it was completed, finding a location for the pipe proved challenging. The city of Pipestone was reluctant to have the pipe installed on its historic Rock Island Depot property. After much debate, the Historic Preservation Committee finally approved the installation with the agreement that the pipe would sit on a foundation of cream-colored brick (to match the depot building) and red quartzite, in a bed of flowers. The Keepers of the Sacred Tradition of Pipemakers bought the depot building and adjacent land in January 1997. Getting the pipe from Spokane to Pipestone presented another challenge. Mike Ziebarth arranged for a trucker who delivered Bayliner boats across the country to haul it to Minnesota for the price of gas. The pipe arrived in Pipestone for installation in January 1999. John Johnston suggested that feathers be added to the sculpture, as Indian tradition holds that the feathers help to speed prayers to the Creator. The feathers were created and attached to the sculpture during an annual pow wow the following August. A local artist painted the pipe sculpture. A poem by Rona Johnston honoring all Native people who have made the journey to Pipestone is engraved on a piece of red quartzite and mounted below the pipe. == Regard == The big pipe was featured in the May 2008 issue of Reader's Digest. People come from all over the world to visit the quarries and have their picture taken in front of the world‚Äôs largest peace pipe. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Keepers of the Sacred Tradition of Pipemakers Category:1999 establishments in Minnesota Category:1999 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in Pipestone County, Minnesota Category:Colossal statues in the United States Category:Outdoor sculptures in Minnesota Category:Roadside attractions in Minnesota Category:Tourist attractions in Pipestone County, Minnesota ","title":"World's Largest Peace Pipe"},{"id":"61356115","text":"The 1924‚Äì1925 Minnesota smallpox epidemic was the deadliest outbreak of smallpox in the U.S. state of Minnesota. 500 people died‚Äî400 of them in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area. Almost 90 percent of the Twin Cities deaths took place in Minneapolis. == Background == Smallpox comes in two varieties, one mild and one deadly (also called black, or virulent, or hemorrhagic.) In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the relatively mild variola minor type was common in Minnesota and killed few people. The deadly type appeared in scattered outbreaks, also killing relatively few. The worst period had been 1871‚Äì1872, when 273 people died, but since then the average had fallen to fewer than 15 deaths a year. People did not much fear it. == Outbreak == The first 1924 deaths took place in Duluth, Minnesota, in January and were followed by more in Minneapolis in the last week of June. They raised little alarm. A few more people died over the summer. In the fall, when people began to huddle indoors, the disease spread: 27 died in October, 66 in November, and 149 in December. At the time, about 240,000 people lived in Saint Paul and 410,000 in Minneapolis. Had the disease affected both cities' populations equally, there would have been 91 deaths in Saint Paul and 129 in Minneapolis. But at the end of 1924, 208 people had died in Minneapolis and only 12 in Saint Paul. Two factors explain the difference. First, Minneapolis had a higher population density. Saint Paul and Minneapolis were about the same size in area, but Minneapolis fit 170,000 more people into an equivalent space. It had more flophouses, shelters, and boarding houses, all of which pressed sometimes sickly people into close quarters. In these conditions, the airborne smallpox virus spread quickly. Second, Saint Paul's public health system responded more efficiently to the crisis. Its workers were better trained, and they acted more quickly to quarantine victims and trace the sources of infection. Minneapolis public health officers, perhaps overwhelmed by the scope of their problem, acted less efficiently in training hospital workers, tracing sources of the virus, and warning schools, businesses, and families of danger when infection appeared. They also put smallpox victims in the public hospital, infecting new victims. Saint Paul officials isolated as many of the ill as they could in a \\"pest house\\" far from the center of town. Minnesota state law blocked a sound public health response. An 1883 state law had required all school-age children to be vaccinated against smallpox. But in 1903, the legislature repealed that law and made compulsory child vaccination illegal. Although smallpox vaccination is almost 100% effective, public health officers had no power to make people protect themselves. They could recommend, but not mandate, the vaccine. Starting in November 1924, both cities launched free vaccination campaigns. Once the deaths mounted, the frightened public jammed the vaccination centers. As reported in the Minneapolis Journal, as many as 17,000 got their skin scratches in a single day. By mid-December 1924‚Äîaccording to public health officials‚Äîsome 210,000 people in Saint Paul and 350,000 in Minneapolis had been vaccinated. December was the worst month; 129 people died in Minneapolis alone. But by then the tide had turned. The disease had carried off the most vulnerable before mass vaccination took effect. 88 people died in January 1925 and 30 in February (all in Minneapolis). By late summer, the epidemic had passed. == Toll == In the final toll, Saint Paul reported 855 smallpox cases and 38 deaths, suggesting a 4.4% death rate. Minneapolis reported 1,430 cases and 365 deaths, indicating a death rate almost six times as high (25.5%). Another 101 people died around the state. Though occasional deaths took place into the early 1940s, smallpox as an epidemic never returned to Minnesota. == References == Category:1924 disasters in the United States Category:1924 health disasters Category:1924 in Minnesota Category:1925 disasters in the United States Category:1925 health disasters Category:1925 in Minnesota Category:20th-century epidemics Category:Health in Minnesota Category:Disease outbreaks in the United States Category:Smallpox epidemics ","title":"1924‚Äì1925 Minnesota smallpox epidemic"},{"id":"61356128","text":"The PFL 7 mixed martial arts event for the 2019 season of the Professional Fighters League was held on October 11, 2019, at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. ==Background== The event was the seventh of the 2019 season and marked the start of the playoffs for the Welterweight and Women's Lightweight divisions.

He made his first news report on a rupture of Mount Parker's crater in South Cotabato that brought flood in the surrounding community. He received several awards for the documentaries he made for the show, including the 1998 CNN World Report Award/Category: On Going Story for \\"Comfort Women.\\" In 1999 together with Jessica Soho's \\"Kidneys for Sale\\" and \\"Kamao,\\" his documentary entitled \\"Mga Batang Alipin\\", an exploration into the country's child labor through the coverage of forced detention and rescue of child-workers in a fish sauce factory, won the George Foster Peabody award, the first for the country and the GMA Network. \\"Mga Batang Alipin\\" was also a finalist in the New York TV and Film Festival's UNICEF Special Award on that same year and in 2000, it won the Award for Investigative Journalism. === News anchor === Aside from being a beat news reporter, he worked as substitute anchor for 24 Oras, an evening news program, and GMA News TV's News to Go. === iWitness === He joined the team of Sandra Aguinaldo, Kara David and Howie Severino that produced i-Witness, a documentary TV show in 2000. The Philippine Army's clearing operation of landmines left by Muslim extremists in Maguindanao was his first documentary that was broadcast in the program. In 2004, his work entitled \\"Batang CP\\" was a finalist in that year's ABU/CASBAA UNICEF Children's Rights Award. It discussed the plight of children with cerebral palsy and co-hosted by Peter Jonas, cerebral palsy-patient who graduated with honors at the University of the Philippines. On the same year, another one of his documentaries named \\"Basurero\\" (Scavenger) that depicted extreme urban poverty was the finalist in the New York and Shanghai TV and Film Festival.

The format showed Taruc riding a motorcycle while covering stories of people and places. According to Aris Ilagan of TopGear, it was the first show in the country that had the format and wrote, \\"With his deep passion for motorcycles and documentaries, he was able to produce a hit series that earned him a strong following in the motorcycle community.\\" It ended on March 16, 2017 despite high ratings and critical success due to inadequate sponsorship to cover production costs. === Ride PH === He left GMA Network in August 2018 when he had difficulties meeting the demands of work while looking after his daughter who was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy. On August 20, 2017 he co-produced and hosted Ride PH, a half-hour TV show on GMA News TV.

Philadelphia Magazine named Monge \\"Best Museum Curator\\" in 2014. Monge's work covers nearly the entire spectrum of biological anthropology from paleoanthropology to forensic anthropology. Her research interests include human evolution, human skeletal biology, bioarchaeology, and life-history/paleodemography. Furthermore, she volunteers her time as an expert witness in criminal defense cases and as a forensic consultant to police. One of the most notable cases to which Monge has contributed was the analysis of the burnt remains of the MOVE-bombing victims. Monge's scientific and curatorial work has been covered in the press and in popular media. == Life and career == Monge earned her doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania in 1991. During her PhD, she was hired to analyze the burned remains of the MOVE-bombing victims. However, she reached different conclusions about some remains' identities than the city's special commission on MOVE. Since then, she has volunteered her service on a variety of forensic cases in Philadelphia. Despite her forensic skills, Monge's main work actually focuses on several topics including the preservation and accessibility of Computed Topography (CT) datasets, traditional radiology, human dental micro- anatomy, and production and distribution of high quality fossil casts. As the Associate Director and Manager of the Casting Program, Monge oversees 3000 molds and casts representing fossils from every phase of human evolution. Her non-profit efforts ensure museums and universities around the world have access to unique specimens. She also travels worldwide to mold recently excavated fossils to include in the collection. Monge has also received a $1.7 million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation to curate a human evolution exhibit at the Penn Museum titled \\"HUMAN EVOLUTION: THE FIRST 200 MILLION YEARS\\". The exhibit ran from 2011 to 2017 when the Penn Museum began preparing for a series of large renovations. In addition to her research at the Penn Museum, Monge continues to conduct fieldwork. She actively excavates along the Swahili cost of Kenya. Her previous fieldwork included sites in Europe and Australia. In the United States, Monge's work has included high profile studies of serial killer H. H. Holmes and the Duffy's Cut mass grave site. Recently, Monge contributed to the largest-ever ancient DNA study illuminating millennia of prehistory in South and Central Asia which was published in 2019. Monge has appeared in two documentaries: Secrets of the Underground (part of America's Buried Massacre series) and Egypt's Ten Greatest Discoveries.

The AutoTrak service was to be Amtrak's answer to the Auto-Train, which, at the time, was operated by the private Auto-Train Corporation. The service was run experimentally, but was ultimately cancelled. Amtrak chose Indianapolis and Poinciana with the intention of each serving as central \\"collector\\" locations serving large market areas. Rather than being the end-destination for travelers, these would be convenient locations along their travel. Amtrak paid Auto-Liner of Omaha, Nebraska, $500,000 to modify twenty autoracks. A test run from Indianapolis to Florida took place on April 30, 1974, carrying rented Avis sedans. Unfortunately, the autoracks damaged the automobiles when run at passenger train speeds due to issues with the tie downs. Amtrak constructed the Poinciana station at a cost of $1 million. The station was opened in September 1974. Plans were that this station would not only serve as the terminus of AutoTrak, but as Amtrak's official station to serve passengers heading to the nearby Walt Disney World resort. At the time, AutoTrak service was planned to start later that year. AutoTrak trains were again experimentally operated beginning in May 1975. Interim equipment was used, with plans for newer and improved equipment to be ordered.

It is owned by Sega as one of five studios under Sega Europe, the others being Creative Assembly, Sports Interactive, Relic Entertainment, and Amplitude Studios. As a developer, Hardlight is focused on mobile games for smartphones. Founded by Sega employee Chris Southall, Hardlight initially began work on research and development for handheld video game consoles, but soon shifted to mobile games after being asked by Sega as part of an initiative to increase mobile game development outside of Japan. Hardlight has since developed several mobile games in the Sonic the Hedgehog and Crazy Taxi video game series. In 2019, Hardlight was more closely integrated into Sega Europe, its parent company. Several of Hardlight's games have been received well, with millions of copies downloaded. ==History== Hardlight was founded by Chris Southall, a former Codemasters employee who also helped to found Sega Racing Studio. After working with Sega Racing Studio, Southall worked in Sega technical support areas along with a team, and served as chief technology officer for Sega Europe. According to Southall, Sega's desire for more development of mobile games led to Hardlight's foundation. Sega revealed Hardlight in January 2012. The initial studio was in Dorridge, Solihull, in the West Midlands. Shortly after its formation, Sega announced that Hardlight was in development on a PlayStation Vita action-adventure game, to be released in late 2012. Hardlight also performed some research and development work for the Nintendo 3DS. According to studio manager Sion Lenton, Hardlight employed 21 employees at this time, in addition to contracted staff, and had a goal of remaining small for the moment. By September 2012, Hardlight had completed a port of Viking: Battle for Asgard for PC. Sega would make the decision to focus more on mobile games in the west, having had success in Japan. Hardlight was asked to shift its focus to developing games for iOS and Android systems. Their first project was a remake of Sonic Jump, which had originally been developed for the T-Mobile Sidekick and released in 2005. Southall called development of the remake \\"an interesting learning process\\". Hardlight relocated its studio around that time to Leamington Spa, a town with a community of video game developers in the area. By the time of Sonic Jump launch in October 2012, the studio was working on developing titles in the Sonic the Hedgehog and Crazy Taxi series. Although initially faced with difficulty deciding which to develop, Sega Sammy Holdings president and chief operating officer (COO) Haruki Satomi saw a demo of Sonic Dash and liked it so much that he insisted it be developed. Sonic Dash was initially scheduled for a Christmas 2012 release, but would not be released until March 2013. The studio's next title was Crazy Taxi: City Rush. The concept for developing a mobile Crazy Taxi game came from the original Sega AM3 producer, Kenji Kanno. Hardlight worked with Kanno on design aspects for the game. Subsequently, Hardlight released Sonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom and Sonic Jump Fever. After these releases, all of which were casual games, Hardlight began looking at developing a more strategy- oriented game involving multiplayer. After some discussions with Sonic Team, Hardlight began working on Sonic Forces Speed Battle, to tie in with the upcoming 2017 release of Sonic Forces. While development of the game began with a small team of three or four developers, up to 28 were involved with the project as the game closed in on its release. In April 2019, Hardlight was integrated more closely into Sega Europe, structuring it as one of five \\"pillars\\" alongside Creative Assembly, Sports Interactive, Relic Entertainment, and Amplitude Studios. In the same announcement, Sega emphasized that Hardlight would continue its focus on mobile games. Neall Jones, formerly of Codemasters, Traveller's Tales, and Eidos Interactive was announced to be the studio's new director; Southall and operations head Harinder Sangha departed for Sumo Digital. Jones anticipated that the studio's staff will double over time. He also expressed a belief in more intellectual property for PCs and consoles will see more releases for mobile devices. Hardlight developed ChuChu Rocket! Universe and Sonic Racing‚Äîa port of Team Sonic Racing‚Äîfor Apple Arcade, which were released on the service's launch date of September 19, 2019. Production of ChuChu Rocket! Universe took approximately eight months starting with a team of 15 people that doubled in size over time. In designing the game, a sequel of the 1999 Dreamcast game ChuChu Rocket!, Hardlight had to redesign the game in full 3D. According to director Paul Tywnholm, testing of the game had to occur internally because the game could not be soft launched for Apple Arcade. Twynholm acknowledged a desire to bring back Sega franchises in future Hardlight releases. Hardlight's games have received numerous downloads. By June 2015, Sonic Dash had been downloaded over 100 million times across multiple different platforms, and had 14 million players per month. By November 2017, Sonic Dash download count was over 300 million. Within its first five days of release, Sonic Forces Speed Battle had been downloaded 1.3 million times, and reached 2 million downloads within its first two weeks. According to Southall in a November 2017 interview, Hardlight was continuing to work on updates for Sonic Dash, Sonic Dash 2, and Crazy Taxi: City Rush. In a February 2020 interview, Jones expressed the studio's surprise at the longevity of Sonic Dash, having been downloaded more than 350 million times and earned more than . He spoke on the implementation of new features to keep the game interesting, as well as additions such as a baby Sonic from the Sonic the Hedgehog film. == List of games == {  + ! Game ! Platform !

He is an Honorary Associate Professor at The University of Queensland and at the University of Sydney. He is known for his planning research and work with British and New South Wales governments. He was engaged in strategic planning and policy formulation at a senior level in the NSW Department of Planning between 1981 and 1991. His papers have been published in Planning Theory, Urban Studies, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, and Geographical Research. Searle served as the Editor-in-Chief of Urban Policy and Research journal from 2004 to 2014. He is a fellow of the Planning Institute of Australia. == Education and early career == Searle was awarded his BA(Hons) from University of Adelaide in 1966. After completing his BA(Hons), he joined the New South Wales Department of Decentralisation & Development as a research officer where he prepared research material and wrote for Development Corporation's Report on Selective Decentralisation and Report on Sandy Hollow/Maryvale Railway Proposal. In 1970, he moved to the New South Wales Treasury as an economic assistant. In 1975, he moved to London and in 1976 joined the United Kingdom Department of Environment where he was a senior research officer. Searle moved back to Australia in 1979 and joined the Monash University as a junior research fellow and carried out field-based study of the nature and causes of employment change in 120 companies in Melbourne. In 1980, he received his PhD from Macquarie University. His thesis title was 'Factors Affecting Government Location Decisions, with Reference to the NSW Government Decentralisation Program'. == Later career == In 1981, Searle joined the New South Wales Department of Planning as a Town Planner and worked there in different positions until 1991. During this time, he was involved in strategic planning and policy formulation at the department. In 1982, he recommended a strategy for relocation of Government head offices within Sydney, which was adopted by the State Cabinet. In 1991, he left the Department of Planning to join the University of Technology Sydney's Faculty of Design, Architecture and Building as a Senior Lecturer in Urban Panning. He also served as the Director of Planning Program at the University from 1998 to 2001 and then again from 2004 to 2009. Searle left University of Technology, Sydney in 2009 to join University of Queensland as Associate Professor in Urban Planning. In 2015, he became Honorary Associate Professor at the university. Searle served as the Editor-in-Chief of Urban Policy and Research journal from 2004 to 2014. He is a fellow of the Planning Institute of Australia. === Work === Searle‚Äôs main work and research focus is on metropolitan strategic planning, and its housing, transport and economic dimensions. He has shown that Australia‚Äôs metropolitan strategic plans are globally distinctive in terms of state control over their outcomes. He has analysed Sydney‚Äôs planning for urban intensification in a number of publications, notably in an article proposing five factors that set limits on such intensification. He pioneered analysis of the planning implications of the privatisation of transport infrastructure provision in Sydney. His published research has also tracked outcomes of the rise of neoliberal ideology on Sydney‚Äôs strategic plans and on economic development policies within Sydney. At the Department of Planning, Searle worked on a planning balance sheet analysis that identified the North West sector as the preferred new growth direction for Sydney from the 1990s, and on a 1989 report that concluded Sydney could expand to 8 million people at then-current densities without running out of development land in the Sydney basin. Searle's research also has a focus on the nature of urban and regional economic and employment change. He has written on the likely nature and locations of changes in job structure and workforce in Sydney and has authored publications relating to the location of high tech industries in Sydney, planning for science parks in Sydney, and the impact of technological change on industrial land use. He has published an edited book, two journal papers and two book chapters on the structure, cluster dynamics and agglomeration economics of the Sydney and Melbourne IT industry, arising from an Australian Research Council Discovery grant (2007-2009). His research on the planning of the year 2000 Sydney Olympic Games analysed the causes of the ‚Äòwhite elephant‚Äô outcome of the main stadium built for the Games in a widely cited 2002 article.

Cameron is the first Republican elected to the office since 1944 and the first African- American attorney general of Kentucky. ==Early life and education== Cameron was born and raised in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. His mother was a professor at Elizabethtown Community and Technical College and his father owned a local coffee shop. Cameron attended John Hardin High School in Elizabethtown and won a prize scholarship named in honor of Senator Mitch McConnell to attend the University of Louisville. At Louisville, Cameron played on the Louisville Cardinals football team in 2005 and 2006. A defensive back, Cameron came off the bench for the first two games of the 2006 season, during which Louisville won the 2007 Orange Bowl. He graduated from the University of Louisville with a Bachelor of Science in 2008, and then graduated in 2011 with a Juris Doctor from the university's Brandeis School of Law where he was president of the Student Bar Association. == CareerEarly career=== Cameron was a law clerk to U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky for two years. After the clerkship with Judge Tatenhove, Cameron served as legal counsel to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from 2015 to 2017. As McConnell's counsel Cameron successfully spearheaded the confirmation processes for conservative federal judges, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/politics/daniel-cameron-kentucky-attorney- general-breonna-taylor/index.html In 2017, Cameron moved back to Louisville and joined the law firm Frost Brown Todd as a senior associate. ===2019 election as Kentucky Attorney General=== Cameron declared that he was running for Attorney General of Kentucky on January 21, 2019. He defeated State Senator Wil Schroder in the Republican primary by a margin of 132,400 (55.3%) votes to 106,950 (44.7%) votes. After the primary, Cameron was endorsed by President Donald Trump. In the November 2019 general election, Cameron defeated the Democratic nominee, former Attorney General Greg Stumbo, with 57.8% of the vote. He is the first Republican elected to be attorney general of Kentucky since Eldon S. Dummit, who served from 1944 to 1948. He is also the state's first African-American attorney general. Following Republican Lieutenant Governor Jenean Hampton, Cameron became Kentucky's second African- American statewide officer, and the first to be independently elected (given that Hampton had shared the 2015 gubernatorial ticket with Matt Bevin). ===Tenure as Kentucky Attorney General=== Cameron's term as attorney general was scheduled to begin on January 6, 2020, but on December 17, 2019, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed an executive order appointing Cameron to the office, filling the vacancy created when Beshear resigned after winning election to the governorship. Immediately after the order was signed, Cameron was officially sworn in.  Proposed abortion halt  On March 27, 2020, Cameron called for halting abortions in Kentucky during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing it was an elective medical procedure that should fall under the statewide ban for the duration of the pandemic. During the closing days of the legislative session, the Kentucky legislature gave the attorney general power to regulate abortion clinics, but the legislation was vetoed by Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic governor.Bruce Schreiner, Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes abortion legislation, Associated Press (April 24, 2020).

Cameron described his request as an attempt \\"to protect the rights of Kentuckians\\"; Beshear condemned Cameron's motion as \\"scary and reckless\\" and said it would endanger public health, lead to more deaths, and harm the economy. The governor noted that Cameron's filing called for the invalidation of executive action that required face masks in public places, imposed restrictions on public gatherings, expanded workers' compensation eligibility for workers under quarantine due to exposure to the virus, and the waiver of copays, deductibles, and other costs associated with COVID-19-related healthcare.

Breonna Taylor case  Following the police killing of Breonna Taylor on March 13, 2020, the Louisville Police Department conducted an internal investigation on the case. On July 14, 2020, over 100 protestors organized by the social justice organization Until Freedom marched to Cameron's house and occupied his lawn to demand charges be brought to the officers involved in the killing. Police officers arrested 87 protestors and charged them with several crimes including Intimidating a Participant in the Legal Process, a Class D felony. Cameron accused the protestors of trespassing on private property and claimed the protest's purpose was to \\"escalate\\" tension and division in the community. On September 23, 2020, Cameron announced that the grand jury indicted officer Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment with regards to the family living next door. Officers Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove were not charged with any crimes and Cameron said that their firing into Taylor's apartment was a justified use of force.Darcy Costello, Key takeaways from AG Daniel Cameron's investigation on the Breonna Taylor case, Louisville Courier Journal (September 23, 2020).

The Louisville Courier Journal raised questions about whether the grand jury was allowed to decide if charges should have been pressed against Mattingly and Cosgrove or if prosecutors decided that the officers acted in self-defense without submitting the issue to the grand jury. Attorneys for Hankison and Walker requested the release of the grand jury transcript and related evidence. On September 28, 2020, a grand juror filed a court motion stating that Cameron had mischaracterized the grand-jury proceedings and was \\"using grand jurors as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility\\" for charging decisions. A judge ordered the release of the grand jury proceedings' recording. A day later, Cameron said that he did not recommend murder charges to the grand jury, but maintained that he presented \\"a thorough and complete case\\" to the grand jurors. African American Prof. Glenn Loury said of Cameron's role in the Breonna Taylor case, \\"I think we desperately need better African-American leadership - more courageous leadership, and people who are prepared to, you know, step away from and stand up for... what they know to be right. So, this demonization of the police officers... [the Breonna Taylor case] has become a cause c√©l√®bre... The gentleman who is in charge of the Attorney General's office in the State of Kentucky happens to be African- American, and he's been trying to hew a very difficult line, and he's met with much vilification. But we need a hundred of him to foster a different account of what's going on and to represent African-Americans in a different way.\\" Minutes 55:00-56:33 National politics After his election as Kentucky attorney general, Cameron was seen as a rising star in the Republican Party. He spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention on August 24, 2020. In September 2020, Cameron appeared on a shortlist of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees by President Donald Trump. ==Personal life== Cameron has been married twice.

She earned a Bachelor of Science in Physics from the University of New South Wales in 2018, and worked at the Sydney Observatory. == Career == Banks is a Wiradjuri woman who grew up on Ku- ring-gai country in Sydney's Northern Beaches and graduated from Davidson High School in 2014. During primary school, Banks was interested in meteorology but always had a fascination with the stars and planets. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 2018 and started working as an Astronomy Guide at the Sydney Observatory, where she teaches Aboriginal astronomy workshops. While training at Sydney Observatory, Banks started to hear about Kamilaroi and Boorong astronomy, prompting her to learn more about her Indigenous Australian heritage. Through this she discovered her ancestry, the Wiradjuri people. Banks then began researching more about Indigenous astronomy, learning about celestial emus that indicate when eggs are available. Learning about the Emu in the Sky constellation inspired Banks to share Aboriginal astronomy with others. While exploring bushland, Banks came across rock carvings that she says \\"appeared to show seven planets, plus the moon, all in a line.\\" Banks wrote that as there would have been no light pollution at the time of the carvings' creation, there would have been the ability to see six planets in the night sky with the naked eye ‚Äì Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Banks wrote, \\"I kept looking and thinking, and I realised that there was one planet missing\\". As Neptune is not physically visible to the human eye, Banks realised that the eighth circle may be the Earth. For Banks's Honours project at UNSW, she is studying the evolution of galaxies and plans to continue on to do a PhD. == Science communication == Banks has worked as a science communicator and is also astronomer in residence on 2SER's weekend breakfast shows and Triple M's Night Shift. On 17 June 2019, Banks appeared as a panellist on a \\"Science Special\\" of the ABC Australia television programme Q&A.;\\"Q&A; Science Special\\" ABC Australia. Broadcast 17 June 2019. Accessed 27 July 2019. Banks has promoted Astrophysics and indigenous science in the media. In 2019 she appeared on The Drum, in an episode which discussed Indigenous History. She also discussed astronomy and the role of planetary movement on ABC News, in July 2019. In Student Edge she described how her Aboriginal identity (as well as Leonardo DiCaprio) has influenced her passion for astronomy.

The song was released on 24 July 2019, while included on the album as the opening track in May of the following year. The band's song \\"The 1975\\" has opened each of their albums and features the same lyrics and music with a different arrangement; however, this fourth version deviates entirely from previous versions and is distinguished as such by fans by the fan-title \\"The 1975 (NOACF)\\". This version uses an entirely new musical composition of piano, harp and orchestral flourishes and features environmental activist Greta Thunberg calling for civil disobedience and direct action, both personal and political, in response to climate change, in a modified version of her own speech \\"Our House Is on Fire\\" from the 2019 World Economic Forum. The song was recorded in June 2019. Proceeds went to the grassroots movement Extinction Rebellion; the song's release coincided with measures by the 1975 which had the described aim of reducing their environmental impact, including reprinting new designs over older, unsold merchandise. The song received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised its emotional impact, the message and the transition on Notes on a Conditional Form from the song into the lead single \\"People\\". ==Background== Greta Thunberg is featured on the track In 2017, the 1975 announced their third studio album would be titled Music for Cars. On 31 May 2018, the band announced that Music for Cars would instead be an \\"era\\" of two albums, which were recorded together. The first album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, was released on 30 November 2018. The second, Notes on a Conditional Form, was later released on 22 May 2020. \\"The 1975\\" is the opening track on the latter. The song features Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg. In August 2018, Thunberg began skipping school on Fridays to protest outside the Swedish Riksdag (parliament) with a sign reading \\"Skolstrejk f√∂r klimatet\\" (\\"School strike for the climate\\"). This sparked a global school strike for climate movement in November 2018. She recorded \\"The 1975\\" in Stockholm, Sweden in late June 2019. Aged 16 at the time, she was the first featured artist on a recording by the 1975 other than the band members. The song was produced by the label Dirty Hit, which was founded by the 1975's manager Jamie Oborne. Oborne and lead vocalist Matty Healy stated that \\"bigger artists\\" than them turned down an opportunity to work with Thunberg. Healy later said that the band wanted to make \\"the most modern statement\\" on the opening track, and that he wanted Thunberg to \\"exist formally\\" in pop culture. Oborne first attempted to contact Thunberg via Instagram, but he was unsuccessful. He was later introduced to her father Svante Thunberg. Thunberg said of the track, her first musical work, that she was \\"grateful to get the opportunity to get [her] message out to a broad new audience in a new way\\". Healy said that meeting Thunberg was \\"such an inspiration\\". ==Composition== Each of the band's first three albums begin with a brief song called \\"The 1975\\", with the same set of lyrics, beginning \\"Go down / Soft sound\\". On Notes on a Conditional Form, this pattern is broken. Lasting 4 minutes and 57 seconds, a protest song opens the album, featuring a spoken word performance by Thunberg, with a backing of ambient music. The lyrics call for civil disobedience and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in response to climate change, based on the January 2019 speech \\"Our House Is on Fire\\", which Thunberg delivered at the World Economic Forum. \\"The 1975\\" marks a shift by the 1975 to more explicitly political messages. It follows political songs from A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, \\"Love It If We Made It\\"‚Äîabout contemporary political events‚Äîand \\"I Like America & America Likes Me\\"‚Äîabout American gun control. Healy described the song as \\"quite beautiful superficially\\", but also \\"quite sad, quite pretty\\" and \\"quite ominous\\". ==Release and promotion== Placard used by Extinction Rebellion, which received proceeds from \\"The 1975\\". \\"The 1975\\" is the first track on Notes on a Conditional Form, and the first of the songs to be released, on 24 July 2019. As they have done in the past, the band deactivated their social media accounts shortly before the song's release. It was initially intended to be released alongside the album, but after its recording in June 2019, it was decided that the song should be released earlier. At Thunberg's request, proceeds from \\"The 1975\\" were donated to the grassroots movement Extinction Rebellion. Spokespeople from Extinction Rebellion praised the track, saying that \\"music has the power to break through barriers\\". The song's release occurred contemporaneously with the record label and band taking measures aiming to reduce their environmental impact, such as Dirty Hit replacing plastic materials with paper. The band hired an eco-management company for performances. The 1975 played recordings of the song to open the band's encore throughout performances in 2019 and 2020. Such performances included at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2019, the BB&T; Pavilion in New Jersey in November 2019, and shows at the Manchester Arena and London O2 Arena during February 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic led to disruption of planned appearances following Notes on a Conditional Forms release, such as an event at London's Finsbury Park in July 2020, where the 1975 planned to implement a number of environmental measures. ==Critical reception== Critical reviews following the song's initial release were mostly positive. On 27 July 2019, Consequence of Sound named the song their favourite of the week. Sean Lang from the publication praised that lead vocalist Matthew Healy let Thunberg deliver the speech, rather than trying to deliver the message himself, and lauded Thunberg for her delivery of a difficult message. Lang called the song a \\"surprising, refreshing risk\\". Madison Feller of Elle complimented the song as \\"pretty stunning\\", saying that it gave her chills. Laura Snapes from The Guardian praised the 1975 for using their platform to highlight a woman's voice. The Telegraph Al Horner called the track \\"surprising and inspiring\\" and \\"brutally, rebelliously stark\\". Jake Kerridge of The Telegraph praised it as the \\"most terrifying\\" spoken word pop music since the 1984 anti-nuclear war song \\"Two Tribes\\", by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Kerridge lauded Thunberg, saying that she \\"help[ed] bring back the protest song in all its terrifying glory\\". However, Ellen Peirson-Hagger of the New Statesman panned a perceived lack of involvement by the band in their own song, both in its composition and in acting upon its message. The song also received positive commentary in its context as the opening song on Notes on a Conditional Form. Several critics praised the transition between \\"The 1975\\" and the more hardcore track \\"People\\", including Claire Shaffer of Rolling Stone and Lizzie Manno of Paste. Insider Callie Ahlgrim similarly lauded that \\"the effect is exquisite\\". Matt Collar of AllMusic reviewed the song as \\"heartfelt\\" and a \\"moving introduction\\" to the album. Writing for Insider, Courteney Larocca praised that it \\"sets [the album] immediately apart\\" from the 1975's previous releases. Claire Biddles of The Line of Best Fit commented that the \\"introspective and coy\\" background music brings more \\"gravitas\\" to Thunberg's speech. Manno called the song a \\"stirring speech that makes an unwavering case for radical change\\" but questioned its \\"artistic purpose\\" on the album. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the album's liner notes, and Pitchfork. * George Daniel ‚Äì keyboards, mixing, producing, programming, strings, writing * Jonathan Gilmore ‚Äì engineering * Matthew Healy ‚Äì keyboards, producing, writing * Robin Schmidt ‚Äì mastering * Greta Thunberg ‚Äì vocals, writing ==ReferencesNotes=Citations=== Category:2019 songs Category:Ambient songs Category:The 1975 songs Category:Environmental songs Category:Extinction Rebellion Category:Spoken word Category:Works by Greta Thunberg ","title":"The 1975 (2019 song)"},{"id":"61357644","text":"Balazhi () is a rural locality (a village) in Kaltovsky Selsoviet, Iglinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Its head coach was former Ozeki Mitsuneyama. It closed in 1982 with all wrestlers and personnel transferreing to the new Kumagatani stable. ==History== A previous incarnation of the stable existed from at least 1922, run by former maegashira Hakkozan and continued after his death in 1951 by former komusubi Tomoegata. This version had yokozuna Yoshibayama and Ozeki Mitsuneyama as members. Upon Mitsuneyama's retirement in January 1960 he branched out and founded a stable of his own, then known as Kumagatani stable. In May 1961 he received the more prestigious Takashima toshiyori (Ex-Tomoegata having switched to the Tomozuna name) and changed the name of the stable to match. Thus the March 1961 and May 1961 banzuke both had stables called Takashima, but they were entirely separate entities, the old continuing as Tomozuna stable. The new Takashima stable would produce its first sekitori in March 1966 following the promotion of Wakahikari to Juryo. But with just a 3-12 record in his Juryo debut the stable would be left without a sekitori again. This would remain the case until the promotion of Daiju to the Juryo division in September 1969. He would quickly rise up the ranks making it to the Makuuchi division in May 1970 and then making his Sanyaku debut at Sekiwake in March 1971. Then in September 1973 he would reach the rank of Ozeki. Daiju would remain the stable's only sekitori until his retirement in May 1977. The Stable would again be without a Sekitori until the promotion of Koboyama to the Juryo division in May 1981. The stable would enter a period of decline after this with the stablemaster's health deteriorating. It deteriorated to such an extent that by 1982 he resigned as head of Takashima stable causing it to merge with another incarnation of Kumagatani stable. ==Owner== 1960-1982: 10th Takashima Toshimasa (former Ozeki Mitsuneyama) ==Notable wrestlers== *Daiju (Ozeki) *Koboyama (Sekiwake) *Wakahikari(Juryo) == See also == *List of sumo stables *List of past sumo wrestlers *Glossary of sumo terms ==References== Category:Defunct sumo stables ","title":"Takashima stable (1961)"},{"id":"61357726","text":"The Democratic Union () was a left-wing political alliance in Israel formed between Meretz, Israel Democratic Party, Labor defector Stav Shaffir, and the Green Movement that ran in the September 2019 Israeli legislative election.

Artists advocated a return to the human figure and everyday reality. They also rejected the aestheticized forms of traditional art, employing informal techniques, expressionism, and collage. ==Origins== By the 1950s, informalist and geometric abstraction had gained prominence throughout Latin America. However, various artists felt that these styles lacked relevance for what was actually happening in society. They wanted to incorporate a more expressive style and recapture the figure in their works. They did not want to go back to the social and political figuration that was practiced in the 1930s and 1940s, but rather focus on more subjective experience. These artists were concerned with the way individuals interacted with society, and Neofiguration was a way for artists to meaningfully engage with the politics and culture within their respective countries. In Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina, Neofiguration referenced previous themes found in abstraction, such as the informal use of line and color, but also including the human figure. In Colombia, Neofiguration was developed more out of the academic tradition, as seen in Fernando Botero. ==ArgentinaPolitical Backdrop=== The political situation in Argentina played an important role in the emergence of the Neofiguration movement among Argentine artists. The political turmoil in Argentina began with a military coup d‚Äô√©tat which ousted President Juan Per√≥n from office in October 1955. In 1958, Arturo Frondizi won the presidential elections with a clear majority of the votes. However, Frondizi soon backed out of promises made during the election, and a wave of violent strikes ensued, prompting the new president to impose a state of siege. By 1959, the country was in serious national debt, accrued primarily due to the poor management of state enterprises. In October 1959, P√©ron supporters planned a massive demonstration that was expected to turn violent. The police and military seized firearms and explosives in a series of raids, and they arrested hundreds of Per√≥n supporters who protested in the streets. These raids and arrests were all legal under the state of siege. ===Otra Figuraci√≥n Members=== Nueva Figuraci√≥n is often associated directly with a group of Argentine artists who formed Otra Figuraci√≥n in 1961. They included Jorge de la Vega, Luis Felipe No√©, R√≥mulo Macci√≥, and Ernesto Deira. Other Argentine artists associated with Nueva Figuraci√≥n include Antonio Segui. Otra Figuraci√≥n wanted to reclaim the figure in their work as a way to engage with the tumultuous political situation. The Neofigurative works in Argentina are characterized by bright colors and free brushwork. Luis Felipe No√©, considered the intellectual leader of the group, was the quickest to adopt a more expressionistic style of painting. In 1959, he opened his first solo exhibition in the midst of Argentina‚Äôs political unrest, and his works were already being noted for their ‚Äúsemi-figurative language.‚Äù This exhibition was also significant because it was the first time No√© met R√≥mulo Macci√≥ and Jorge de la Vega who would also become members of Otra Figuraci√≥n. No√©‚Äôs early works often deal with themes of power, as demonstrated in paintings such as History of Human Indulgence (1960) and Theory and Practice of Power (1961). These paintings suggest No√©‚Äôs pessimism regarding the political evolution in Argentina. He primarily viewed the world as one of chaos and accepted this chaos as a guiding principle in navigating society. No√© also employed collage and a diverse range of mediums in his paintings. An example of this is Thundering Jupiter from 1960, in which he threw, scraped, and splattered oil paint, enamel, shoe polish, furniture polish and floor wax. Though he employed an expressionistic style, No√© conveyed the social commitment of his art in warning against what he considered to be the greatest downfall of expressionism: excessive focus on oneself. In 1960, No√© stated ‚ÄúI want to show something more than just my will to expression and my self. I believe that the self, by itself, is of no interest to anyone. But rather the self in relation to the world: that is, when it ceases being a self and becomes an element in that relationship.‚Äù Thus, No√© defined early the mission of Nueva Figuraci√≥n as a movement that was both expressive in its use of the figure, but also dedicated to the social reality of Argentina at the time. R√≥mulo Macci√≥ was a self-taught artist, graphic designer, and painter whose first solo exhibition in 1956 predominantly featured art of surrealist themes. Macci√≥ joined Phases, a neosurrealist group which sought middle ground between the decorative art of abstractionism and the overtly politically-motivated art of social realism. Otra Figuraci√≥n mirrored the objective of Phases in its desire to branch away from both geometric abstractionism and social realism, calling artists to engage with society, but also to transcend political issues rather than pick sides. In fact, No√© cites Boa, an Argentine strand of Phases, as the most significant influence in the ideology of Otra Figuraci√≥n. Around this same time, Macci√≥‚Äôs work became more spontaneous and expressive, signifying his transition into Neogfiguration and Otra Figuraci√≥n. Jorge de la Vega, coming from a background of architecture and abstraction, took the longest of the group before shifting into a more expressionistic style of painting. His shift to include figures can be seen in 1959, with works such as Los N√°ufragos in which eyes and mouths can be identified among the complex, flowing lines. He also created collages to incorporate the figure, such as Danza de monta√±a in 1963. This work is composed of rags glued together to form an intense and even violent subject, equaled in intensity by the physical texture of the piece. No√© specifically noted de la Vega for his ‚Äúdarker‚Ä¶ more textured‚Äù style which was ‚Äúexecuted with free, lyrical gestures.‚Äù Ernesto Deira was the last to be introduced to No√© by Macci√≥ in 1960. Deira was a lawyer who had also studied painting and came to the group already a strong figural artist. In expressing a common commitment to the expressionistic use of the figure, Deira became the fourth member of Otra Figuraci√≥n. Deira‚Äôs style was significantly influenced by Francisco Goya‚Äôs Black Paintings, but with freer brushwork. These four artists worked together under the name Otra Figuraci√≥n from 1961-1965, based in an old hat factory which was given to No√© by his father and served as a studio space. ===Exhibitions and Impact=== Otra Figuraci√≥n exhibited several times together between 1961-1965. Their first group exhibition, simply titled Otra Figuraci√≥n, was held in Buenos Aires in 1961 and was well-received, yet also recognized as innovative and new. Over their years together, the group won various prizes and participated in international exhibitions in Paris, New York, and several other cities across the United States. They received some criticism for their ground-breaking development of Neofiguration and their rejection of established art norms, but they generally maintained institutional support. Their joint work is noted for its radical and spontaneous nature, and the group for their intense commitment to demonstrating expressive freedom and addressing Argentina‚Äôs most pressing issues. The group continued to work together until disbanding in 1965, at which time the political situation was becoming increasingly repressive and the country continued to be plagued by a series of military dictatorships and unrest. ==MexicoEmergence in Mexico=== Neofiguration emerged in Mexico at the same time it was being practiced by Otra Figuraci√≥n in Argentina. However, the Neofiguration movement in Mexico was pursued by artists as a reaction against Mexican Muralism, which was seen as too nationalistic and politically motivated. The first significant push away from muralism was captured before the 1950s in Rufino Tamayo‚Äôs cubist-style works. This encouraged many younger artists to also step away from the muralism tradition, which had at this point become the institutionalized art form of Mexico. Jos√© Luis Cuevas, the first artist to take up a neofigurative style in Mexico, was also reacting against the predominance of muralism. However, he was not inspired to follow the same path as Tamayo. Rather, Cuevas related more meaningfully to Jose Orozco‚Äôs style of painting and his existential use of the human figure. Cuevas first started to work in this style in the 1950s, with Neofiguration really starting to build prominence in Mexico in the 1960s. Cuevas also spoke out directly against muralism in his 1956 manifesto ‚ÄúCactus Curtain,‚Äù which criticized muralism for its allegiance to nationalism. Contrary to the perspective of muralists like Diego Rivera and David Siqueiros who saw a world composed of either heroes or villains, Cuevas saw individuals as the products of larger forces, such as war and isolation. Cuevas‚Äô works evoke a consistent theme of alienation. His subject matter focuses on those people who are most marginalized by society, highlighting prostitutes, performers, people with mental health issues, and the poor. His figures are often depicted as distorted versions of the human form. Cuevas included self- portraits in some of his works, painting his own figure among other alienated figures in society. In terms of medium, Cuevas chose to work in ink drawing and watercolor as opposed to oil painting. He saw oil painting as too slow and correctable, whereas drawing and watercolor embodied a more immediate and personal method of conveying ideas and connecting with the viewer. ===Nueva Presencia=== In the 1960s, Neofiguration was taken up by more artists in Mexico, with Francisco Icaza and Arnold Belkin at the forefront. Belkin and Icaza embraced Neofiguration and formed a group called Nueva Presencia (translated \\"New Presence\\") in 1961. At the same time, they published their first issue of a magazine-poster also called Nueva Presencia in August 1961. Some members of this group included Leonel G√≥ngora (Colombian but based in Mexico), painter Francisco Corzas, and photographer Ignacio ‚ÄúNacho‚Äù L√≥pez. The artists of Nueva Presencia shared Cuevas‚Äô commitment to anti-aesthetic art. They adopted an expressionistic and informal style as they called for a common rejection of abstraction. Furthermore, they denounced art that was motivated by a specific political agenda. However, Nueva Presencia differed from Cuevas in that they were committed to the idea that artists needed to be socially responsible in addressing the pressing issues of the day. Whereas Cuevas acted as an observer in political and social spheres, the artists of Nueva Presencia felt obligated to participate in society, demanding an ‚Äúart which does not separate man as an individual from man as an integral part of society. No one, especially the artist, has a right to be indifferent to the social order.‚Äù This magazine-poster denounced art of bourgeoisie ‚Äúgood taste‚Äù and rather pushed a form of art that was relevant for their contemporaries. Their commitment was not to specific social issues, such as poverty or local politics; rather, their works addressed larger issues concerning humanity. They wanted to respond to the atrocities they witnessed in World War II, namely the Holocaust, the atomic bomb, and Hiroshima. Their works were targeted toward the general public and their subject matter encompassed broad themes of war and violence. This same objective is expressed in Selden Rodman‚Äôs book The Insiders. Belkin reviewed this book in the first issue of the Nueva Presencia publication, affirming their shared mission to participate in the larger society. Many artists who were a part of Nueva Presencia participated in the corresponding Los Interiostas exhibition on July 20th, 1961 and the artists who participated are sometimes referred to by the group name \\"Los Interioristas.\\" Belkin and Icaza published a total of five issues of Nueva Presencia between July 1961 and September 1963, during which time they also produced their own individual artworks. A sixth issue had been planned by Belkin, but the group dissolved before it could be published. The group‚Äôs work culminated in 1963 with a continuing strain to affirm a common humanity and promote social responsibility, but the group was ultimately disbanded by 1964 due to a combination of petty jealousies, tensions, and misunderstandings. ==Venezuela== In Venezuela, Jacobo Borges and Roberto Obreg√≥n also embraced Neofiguration. In 1958, the military regime that had ruled Venezuela for 10 years was replaced by a democratic government. The new government caused widespread frustration, as its socialist tendencies angered the right, while its opposition to Castroites angered the left, including Borges. In response, Borges began to work in an expressionistic style and took up a form of Neofiguration that was more overtly political than the works of his Mexican and Argentine counterparts. Borges had direct contact with Mexican artists who were a part of Nueva Figuraci√≥n, and he participated in an exhibition in 1959 with younger Mexican artists at the Palacio Nacional de Bellas Artes. His work is characterized by vibrant colors which highlight his critique of the Venezuelan bourgeoisie. Borges efforts in the Neofigurative style culminated in 1963-1965, a period which produced some of his best known works. ==Colombia== In Colombia, prominent artists to embrace figurative painting include Fernando Botero and D√©bora Arango. These artists, along with Pedro Alc√°ntara, employed the figure as a means to challenge political oppression. The Colombian Neofigurative artists pursued this style as a means to respond to the horrors of La Violencia. Though tensions between the conservatives and liberals began in 1946, the beginning of La Violencia is often marked by the assassination of politician Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n in 1948. This civil war in Colombia was a bitter and violent struggle that caused widespread death and devastation among the people of Colombia and the society at large. Neofiguration in Colombia had its roots in late cubism rather than geometric abstraction, as in Mexico and Argentina. Fernando Botero's contribution to Neofiguration coincide with his appropriation of the most famous works throughout art history, from the Middle Ages, to the Impressionists, to Picasso and Matisse. However, in his reworking of these famous paintings. Botero puts his own spin on the original subjects. Botero's figures are easily recognized for their unique and consistently large proportions. These \\"inflated\\" figures are identifiable in all of his works, including not only historical appropriations, but also scenes depicting the violence of Colombia's civil war. D√©bora Arango embraced a neofigurative style as her response to La Violencia as well. In her approach to the figure, she satirized military, political, and religious leaders. In Laureano's Exit (c. 1957), for example, she depicts the military general behind the coup d'√©tat of 1953 and a well-known politician as having the legs of frogs and reptiles. Arango's chose to work in oil painting, and her works are characterized by their inventive, brushy, and assertive style. ==References== Category:Art movements ","title":"Nueva Figuraci√≥n"},{"id":"61357842","text":"Girlie was a hit for jazz/pop trio, The Peddlers in 1970.
